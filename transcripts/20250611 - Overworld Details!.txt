Hello Xlings, hello every smart guy. Today we have a special guest, hello James L. Who's the guest? I'm not revealing just yet. Hello Lila. Yeah Lila, I posted the issue here. SS is tonight. You can't, I can't edit. Even if I rename it to Fast64, I cannot. No, that's from going to edit preferences and then checking the text box for Fast64. I can show you right now real quick. As soon as this is done loading. Hello Droidseeker. Yes, I downloaded that and then I extracted it and I put it in this folder. And then if I click the checkbox here, that's the error I get. Why did you extract? Because you have to extract. You always have to extract. Look, this is extracted. I can show you again if you want. Or do you want me to just put the zip file in here? I would assume not, right? Considering this is extracted. Like why wouldn't the other one be? No? You don't want me to extract this into here? This is wrong? This changed in URMR? What? Why don't you just use the install button? There's an install button? How does that work? Where do you install it? In the drop-down menu. I don't see a drop-down menu. Oh, this one? Install from disk. Then you get the zip file. Let's see. Oh god, which one is it? This one? Yep, that works. But the normal way of doing it does not work.  Well, let's try your add-on then, I guess. If there's so many newcomers to Mario 64, I always say start with a small mod. Um, I don't think Fast64 is installed. What the fuck? I guess Crested works. We will see. Okay, so you pissed me off. Fuck you. Fuck you, X-Links. Let's see what happens. No, it doesn't work. You see that? It just still turns white. I don't know why he turns white. Makes no sense to me, but he does. The HUD elements should not... Actually, I could. Yes, Facebook. But no, I'm not editing it. So you don't mind if I don't bleed? Bleed is not on. And write all... I had write all off. I swear it was off. Why was it on again? I'm like 100% sure it was off. So does write all just come on again every time you open the blend file? Okay, it's wrong even with write all off. Okay, you see write all is off. That's not the blend file. Does it turn itself on? It turns itself on! The option that breaks if you don't have bleed activated turns itself on whenever you open the I don't want bleed and write all on over the entire repo because I can't use it without bleed and then I can't use bleed on everything. Leela, that's a big problem. Leela, I don't want to update my repo settings. I need write all on for most things. What do you mean? Write all works just fine with bleed and inline. It doesn't work fine without bleed. That should be saved in a file. I'll just remove the write all line and then turn it... Okay, but then I'm gonna turn it back on in every file that uses bleed and inline. It's in a json file. Okay, I need to change that. You have to admit this is a little obscure to change.  no wonder I kept getting bugs. It's because that turns itself on over and over. Okay, then what do you want? Well, if it's an option like that, that can only coexist if locally in the file an option is turned on, then it needs to be done in the file. Because this option doesn't work without this one turned on. Okay, so clearly there should be something that links these two together or like puts them in the same place if you ask me. Especially if that option keeps resetting itself when you reload the file. So turn off auto node repo settings. Well, node repo settings is actually pretty useful. I just did not realize this was part of the repo settings, but I agree the UI makes it pretty clear it's part of repo settings. It just never crossed my mind that something like this would be part of the repo settings. It's more of a revert fixes PR moment. Well, either way that option just now sure screwed things up. I don't know where else this would have messed stuff up, but I'm pretty sure I got other issues now, too, that I don't realize before. Yeah, so just wait. Mario's hair is gone. Oh my god. Nina, this is why I didn't want to test the PR because every time you export Mario, stuff like this happens. Maybe the alpha 64 version has his hair still in there. I'm going to turn write all turned itself on again and I removed it from the repo settings.  What was the issue? His hair was gone just now, and I don't know why. It's just the file having it on. Are you sure? I mean, you saw me remove it from the repo settings just now and it's turned off right now. Let's see what happens when I reload the file. Okay, it did not turn itself back on. That's good. Let's see if his hair is back. Hello, Sarah, I figured. Okay, yeah, his hair is back. So it seems in the new version his hair disappears. No, don't hate Lila. She does great work on fast 64. Hello, Ireland. So yeah, the stream special guest today is Luigi. So So Co-op confirmed? Well, I'm not 100% sure exactly how Luigi ties into this yet. Co-op would be the coolest option. So Sometimes it's a bit weird, but this is just because this is like a really weird jank switch way I have to do it. After the credits, Luigi had some Yoshi egg. Why did that hat happen? I'm not sure. I know the hat used to or the hair used to disappear when I had right all off before, on before. So I'm 50-50 on just now there being some confusion and I actually exported him with right all on instead of right all off or UMR having that issue. Present past few weeks? Pretty good. I finished most of course 7 and I set it out for a beta test. I'll get test data on that soon, I hope. It fully works on real N64, which is amazing. Is it a me bug or a you bug? Well, there's definitely at least one you bug in here. And the hair being gone just now might have been from right all being on with bleed off or it might have been from your PR. I'm 50-50 on it. All right, I gotta edit that all out. Either way, it did not actually fix the bug with the eyes, so I don't think we can say that works. Like switch options, inside switch options are still broken for sure, guaranteed 100%. When a tree speed change, you kind of find them ugly. These ones, yes. These ones, they're placeholders and were never meant to actually make it into the game. Layer I was working on something. So you don't get any fix then because you also don't have layer override caps. Layer override caps. Oh yeah, I do not have any of that. Don't worry, we're targeting real hardware. We need an OST for today. Any wishes? I was also working on a bunch of smaller features performance improvements recently. I was working on the exit course dialog. After you get a star, you can now just exit the course. I don't know if you remember in demo, you would just stay. That's a bit awkward, I think. Pokemon Gen 5 OST. You know what, I'm up for that. Oh, this is black and white. I am such a Pokemon boomer. Oh, I see. That's nice. Don't worry, we'll kill your hardware for sure. Is the music volume appropriate? I need to ask because it seemed pretty loud to me. You've tried any Pokemon fangames like Flux? No, I kind of doubt that any fangames are good. I played Pokemon Prism, which was at the time the most popular one. And like the first thing that happens in the game is you see like a weird cut scene where you play as Larvitar for some reason and then that never happens again. And then for some reason, you are stuck in a cave with a million Zubats. And I was like, damn, this shit's ass. If this is the best Pokemon romhack they have to offer, I'm not playing Pokemon romhacks anymore. I'm not sure what that means. What do you mean by dynamic substance? What's the deal from the broken model switch? What is the broken model switch? Oh, it's not option zero. It is like everything but the base option where the color is white. Should I try Pokemon romhacks again? Should I try Alpharad's Mario one? I actually almost tried that. That one looked pretty interesting. Hello, Moldy. Wait, how did you type a fully read well? How did bro do that? What? Hello, Pickles. How did you get Windows 11? I got Windows 11 on Thursday. See, I didn't want to update to Windows 11, but I know that Windows 10 is going to stop security updates soon. And I thought there was a chance I had a virus, though I had no idea where it would have come from, because I got a weird security alert. So I figured, you know what, I might as well use this to update to Windows 11. So here we are. You could have come to Linus. I actually couldn't have because I need Windows for work. I don't think Windows 11 so far is significantly worse than Windows 10. Although it is completely embarrassing and pathetic how buggy Windows 11 has been so far. And how often it hangs and stuff like that. It truly is a comedy. Then again, Windows 10 was also like absolutely garbage. I don't know how they get away with like making that much garbage software and they don't have anyone to Like competing with them and like out-competing the fuck out of them. I guess it's because they are the industry standard and the human race has a lot of inertia. Why can I not select this thing behind it? I need to toggle X-Ray first. God, that sucks. This is the new Blender version, by the way. I mean, just today we imported Luigi. I don't give a fuck about telemetry. See, okay, I know this one's a controversial opinion, but I prefer customized ads. If I'm going to have to sit there and watch a fucking ad, at least show me a product I might want to buy. If you are someone who's like, oh, I don't want them to cater ads to my interests, like why? Are you so weak-willed that you think that you're going to buy a garbage project against your best interest just because it's made for you? Really? Aren't you like telling on yourself? And that's my controversial opinion of the day. First up, Manny. I don't know where to go from here. Is Spain that bad? I actually have no idea what Spain is like. Is Spain like, you know, nearly a third world country in the same way like Brazil is? What about Portugal? I don't know. Let's check what else is in the deck before release. Side levels, overworld, bug fixes, beta testing. Well, I was in Spain too once. I was on Mallorca with my parents. Just like vacation in Spain on Mallorca is like the most German thing ever. It's like you do that and then you drink a lot of beer and that's your vacation. Hello, Magwell. Segwell. Well, bug fixing is a lot of work for the hack of the size, especially because we rewrote the engine so many times. It changes a lot of stuff. Well, I don't drink beer. I was four years old when my parents went there to party. Are you German or Canadian? I'm German. I strike you as a guy who drinks beer? I'm yicky? No! That's even worse than icky. Okay.  This is Mallorca right now so you can confirm. Yep. Germans and Magelov are almost as good as paired German. I have no idea what that means. What's so surprising about that? I mean, it's a 3D model editor. You'd think it's good at 3D model editing. Okay, we gotta design this mountain here somehow. What do we make out of this mountain? We could just have this be a big forest. Honestly, I think I like that. Well, actually, that's not the only big forest, but that would make most of the other big forests. What about spiky overhang protruding along a semi-circle? Let's see what you mean by spiky overhang. Oh. No, we can't do that at all. This is all... We need to make the forest on it somehow. We can't just... I don't think it will work. Okay. I think some comic text are making UV map bullshit for these dino actors. The dino actors? Divine dino domain? Are there many dino actors? Oh, wait, you mean dino domain actors. Okay, nevermind. This texture I made has almost seamlessly in the model, but it was pain to get it right. Oh, God. What is this? That's a crazy texture, though. What the fuck?  Why did you guys make me do this? Look what you made me do. Meow, meow, meow. I'll let the cats in the stream again. Okay.  Politics was more fun when no one took him serious. When we were all just shitposting about it, because no one really cares. Now everyone cares. Unbelievable. We all became adults. Yeah. You text the sides and read them. I don't want to bother reading it, because the colors are dark. I don't want to bother reading it, because the colors are dark. I'm sure someone did. There is a visual novel engine. That spooky Allua released. Oh my God, dude, what's with all the lag? What the fuck? Who put me out here? Holy fuck, this is bad. Open the menu. Did you see how long that took? Oh my God. 100% CPU and... Why is NEMU64 taking 10% of my CPU? Cloner, Alliance, Alba, we don't need that either. What the fuck? Blender is only taking 15% CPU and it's still doing this. And 10GB of RAM. Okay, I'm restarting Blender. Something must have gone wrong. Okay. Put it into main, Leela. I don't want to get on yet another branch and have even more different bugs that I don't know about. Okay. Still being developed. So it's not even functional yet. As soon as it's functional it should be in main. But this is CPU anyway. How would the renderer help? Surely Blender is not rendering on the CPU.  The idea of an operating system costing performance is ridiculous by itself. We had operating systems running on Windows 95 computers in like 1995. Surely basically the same functionality shouldn't be taking any measured performance in modern computing age. Hmm. God, this is annoying. Well, after restarting Blender it does a lot better, seemingly. So that's good. Right, move to CTRL-X. Hmm. Hmm. Sorry, I've been using Windows 8. And then Thursday. I'm also on a new Blender version, which is why I'm a lot slower at using Blender now, but seemingly no one even noticed. I keep forgetting what the first person lock is. Okay, let's do this. That does sound cool, Lila. I hope they finish it soon. Okay, let's do this. I'm there, I'm waiting on HTD. Who is HTD? Hail to the dongle. Oh, I see. Do we have pack normals yet? Uh, no. You will never have them is not accurate either. Or at least... I mean, it might be accurate, but you don't know. Like, if Sauron gets struck by lightning tomorrow, then we probably will never have them. LVP is significantly faster than the RDP. Let's expect that FPS on console. Basically perfect FPS, why? Okay, let's do this. Okay, we'll allow this fucking keyboard. Wait, is my NVIDIA Broadcast no longer active? Has it been inactive ever since I started streaming on this PC? Crazy if true. I'm very interested to see if this will run on the analog. It's not just going to work out of the box with Wiseguy's tools, obviously. But Wiseguy seems pretty confident that it will work. Okay, let's do this. Oh my god, it's so goddamn slow. Do you see that? Why? Dude, it's actually unreasonable to work with this. What the fuck? I might have to go back to an old Blender version just because of this. What if we told you 15 times what it lacks? Alright, shall we download an earlier Blender version then? Let's do it. I'm not downloading fucking F64. Can I just strangle you? Okay, are you saying that... Okay, you know what? I will do it. I will download it. And then what? What do I do after downloading this, huh? Leela is not a miner. I can give her death threats all I want. Ah, this is a whole stream of just fucking waiting for Blender to do its thing. This is a nightmare. Why did they do this to Blender? Why would they do this to Blender, man? It wasn't like this last stream. 10-year-old computer? Mine is 7 years old now. But I did upgrade the CPU and GPU, so I guess not really. Open the menu, please. Open the menu, please. Okay. Okay. And you said now select it instead of Eevee? Where do I even do that? Go to render settings and come with object properties tab. Okay, that sounds like it's here. F64 renderer. Okay, let's see if this is faster. I'm gonna keep the task manager open just so we can see the comparison. Okay, so far it's kind of goated. Wait, maybe we have to take back the death threats. Wait, maybe Leela was right. Oh, so that's what you mean by decalimilation? How this goes through the mushroom? I suppose that could be accurate. How does it know which microcode I'm on, though? Does it do this correctly?  Is it a purist thing? What are you talking about? I mean, if this is decalimilation, then this is right. Because I'm really, really far away. Right, this might actually be what we get in-game. Well, actually this might be going at lower precision, but I'm not sure. So honestly, that's a good thing, that it's showing up like that. I'm just not sure if it's 100% accurate. But definitely not something I would complain about. I mean, we can check it out, right? Let's see. As soon as I... Okay, this camera setting, let's remember this camera setting. Export this, see if that's accurate to what we get in-game. That exported fast. Blender right now is taking 0% CPU and 5GB of memory. I'm getting an analog 3D, so I can tell you guys whether that's any decent. True? But I don't think it's like that on N64 either. You think it doesn't exist? Honestly, I don't think it exists either. Do you think I can ask for my money back with interest? Like if they don't ship it to me? Because I could have had the money invested in the meantime. Yeah, okay, so the decal emulation seems not quite accurate. I still don't see a clip through. Yeah, I think the decal emulation is a little... It quantizes the depth down too much. Cliplanes are not missing, they're set in the area route. I assume I have to debug level with the pipes. Why? Yeah, but cliplanes are set, and they match the ones in-game. Or do you mean the renderer doesn't actually read them from the 564 stuff? I have no idea what works in the Daedalus. Why would I know about such an obscure thing? Damn, Biobak, maybe you should download this renderer too. Sim doesn't use TLB, is this fake? No... I think the error message is just not perfect. How do I compare to Eevee is my question. I imagine Eevee does stuff like they have one universal global shader that runs all the Blender shader possibilities. Whereas the 564 renderer just renders in N64 styles without all the normal maps and stuff like that. Ugh. Ooh, that's fucking rough. Are you going to play Deltarune? Yeah, when it's done. Oh, but Case, if you wait that long, you'll let the game spoil to you and don't care. Also not true, I have not had a single Deltarune spoil on my life. Or probably I had one and just forgot about it because I didn't care enough. Render settings. Where would this be? Does it give me anything in a sec? Nope, TLB is slow. Here? Turn off atomic emulation. Let's get out the UI account. It doesn't get any bigger than this. What do you mean? You mean this part? Oh. Okay. Interesting. Well, atomic rendering does seem to fix that part at least. Oh well. So Nintendo endorses gambling, but children are used to seeing Nintendo say, well, I have gambling. Only fake gambling. So, okay, question. How much would you guys hate the idea of F3 this year having a YouTube sponsor? Because that's like the easiest way I can justify making another F3. If I get paid for it. Because I need to pay my editor and stuff. Why would it be against having a sponsor? I don't know man, some people just hate the idea of sponsors. You know this is a thing that I talked about just yesterday, sometimes youtubers get one guide where it's like there's an opinion out there literally just one guy has and you have to listen to it because they hate you for it and it's like okay well it's just one guy you shouldn't you know care at all but it is one guy you know sometimes you get one guide. This game will stay below 64 megabytes or exactly at 64 megabytes. Right now we use around 60 megabytes, actually let me check, guys, ROM size estimation game, you all have to guess how big the ROM is. Whoever is closest gets to ban Leela from chat, no, whoever is closest wins. 54.7, 59.456, okay that's a good one I think. 45 plus, 61.4. 59.98, 58.2, all right let's see. 59.9. Let's see the exact number. Let's go to 60. Wait, by 64, 59.953, this is the exact number. Someone was really close to that. 59.6, that's a good one, 59.45. PeppyPrinny wins this one. The game has a good chance of being done by the end of the year. Maybe like if I lose my job. I don't know. I feel like a normal person would talk about megabytes. A megabyte being 1024, multiply by 1024 bytes. Okay, I can't tell if this is an issue with F64 renderer or if my thing is wrong. Because this is a transparent decal and it doesn't render. But it does this. Not really correctly. But there's definitely a bug here going on. Because there's a harsh cutoff here but not in game. I think there's an SI prefix. I don't care, man. You told me to use this. We can always find a way to blame this back onto you. Do not underestimate my ability to blame Leela. Well, let's not get it in game, I suppose. It's self-performance, right? I mean, self-rendered, yeah. Is it just my imagination or does it also export way faster? He gifted five memberships. Yo, thank you for the gifts. Damn, YouTube's just giving out the memberships to random people. Most of these I haven't seen talking here forever. Wait, it actually just doesn't render. What is going on? Oh, and the warp broke. 3A, 4A... Wait, 4A goes to castle grounds, 1, 3B... Should land on castle in sight. 1, 3B. Okay, there we go. But what did I do wrong? If I did anything wrong here... Wait, what? Oh, I know what happened. Wait, no, that's not it. Okay, this is bizarre. What the hell is going on? Okay. I genuinely have a hard time telling what the fuck is going on. I think, same strategy, let's just export, see what happens. Okay. No, it's just transparent decal. Oh yeah, I want to show you guys a new feature. Let me know what you think. Okay, so let's say I collect a star. First of all, look at my fucking 6-speed run, I'm so good at Mario. Fuck. He didn't see me with the landing. Now look at this. Do you want to return to the overworld? Stay or leave? If you hit stay, you stay. If you hit leave, it pops you out. Isn't that cool? Okay. Memberships are like, you don't get ads on the thing, and the streamer gets some money for you, and you get a cool icon.  Ooh, it works. But it doesn't render perfectly in the new renderer. I have to admit, this is not what we want it to look like. By the way, I think for the first pass of the overworld, we're just going to keep it like this. It will be connected, but it won't look right. After your pass is done, I'm going to make this all into one big level that loads dynamically as you walk through it. Because there's going to be stuff like the tree here that's going to be visible from multiple sides. And we don't want to deal with this sucking forest to work with. Makes sense, right? Alright, good. Paid subscription keeps adding ads. That sounds awful. So there's an oil tanker full of enemies that you have to infiltrate. Put some kind of boss fight in there after you beat the boss, entering the tanker warps you to oily body bay. That sounds like a side level. If you have oily body bay, you can go to side level 5. Wait, did we ever... We never wrote this formally down, did we? There's a whole mission you have to do to unlock this? It's 5 bosses. Oh, I guess there's S7 bosses, oil tanker. Leveling up for a side level is a crazy idea. Yeah! I do like it. There should be a star at the end of this. God damn. Well, these side levels, I hope we can make them a little faster. These are going to be, like, small levels. We're probably going to make each one of them in, like, a day or two at most. God, I got so many bug bites on my feet. I'm going to keep scratching. I'm going to die. Bonus loot clips. Maybe I should start selling feed pigs. Maybe then I could finally retire and finish RTYI in 2025. Day or two for you and a week for me. I hope not. You don't have to go that hard on all the side levels. No, I was outside in high grass and I just walked there in only sandals. Crocs. Okay. Can't go hard on only half the game. Yeah, but they can be a little simpler, right? I wasn't looking for Pokémon, I was looking for my lawnmower. Alright, let's do this section next. We're back to Volcano. The outer lawnmower ran away. Now it gets stuck! Sometimes they get stuck, man. Oh. Where's the mark seem but? Oh, so that's how you do it properly. Okay. I imagine now the entire year that I wonder if I get to take a lawnmower and stuck. That's not so bad because I can do it while brushing my teeth. You hadn't thought about that, have you? Okay. Lawnmower is a kind of Pokémon? Yeah, there is a lawnmower Pokémon. Man, just... Gamefreak is just doing shit now, you know. What, now there's a lawnmower Pokémon? Unbelievable. Mod on Gamefreak, can you believe it? Okay. Okay. You're forgetting the fact that an automatic lawnmower is really fucking cool.  Like damn, I just have a little robot friend that like runs through my house and... Through my lawn and like does the stuff. This is just like Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. Think about it. Okay. Do you expect man, I'm a man in my 30s. Of course I'm gonna talk about lawnmowers. Hold on, doorway plank. Think he's from my apartment so I don't have to vacuum him up. Googly eyes to your robots? True. That makes them instantly more personable. I should get googly eyes for my guy. Do they have those on Teemo? Teemo googly eyes. How much do you think googly eyes on Teemo are? Like a packet of two. A packet of 20. Let's say a packet of 20. Price guessing. Like one dollar? Oh my god. How do they do it? 700 for 3 dollars? What the fuck? How do you produce it like that? Like I would say, okay these are like Chinese children being enslaved. But that doesn't even make sense. That doesn't explain how that's so cheap. Do you ever see them bolder and not in movement and then... I don't know if I have to make them seamless seamless or just look seamless. I zoom in a lot. They're always in motion. Well, what about the one in the slide? Actually, I think that one just rolls back off. Automation. I think the prices at Teemo are proof that capitalism has failed us. Why can't the Chinese have it so cheap? I mean, generally, does it really make sense that everything is so expensive? Think about it. The human race now, with all the automation, is probably literally like a thousand times more productive. And Hunter-Gatherer used to, back in the day, they used to have like 8 hours or so of work. So how come we don't have like literally 5 minutes of work a day? Doesn't make sense, right? Alright, Leela. I will try not to break anything. I don't know if just capitalism is the answer here. Honey, nothing has worked for 8 hours? Did you ask them? Well, okay, they definitely didn't work for more than 16 hours. So, even if we scale with 16 hours, that's 10 minutes of work. Reckoning increases because you're more efficient? Get scammed, white collar. I don't know, man. Something's odd. We have enough technology and food and money to have everything on this planet have their needs met? Yeah. But I'm saying, why doesn't it take 5 minutes to just have your needs met? That's what confuses me. Is it just there's so many people now that... Or are we just consuming so much needless bullshit that we're spending our multiplication factor on that? Are there just so many people that it's... No, I don't see how many people existing makes argumental sense here. I don't know, man. It's weird. I don't get it.  We're having more bullshit. Yeah. Is it because of all the bullshit we want? Is it because we're not satisfied just sitting in a dark room eating fucking bread and drinking water and doing nothing? I have no idea what you mean but I disagree. Dang. Xlinks is on his hater era right now. God, it's so itchy from all the bug bites. I'm gonna lose my mind, dude. Still preppy, Brené. Well, I don't know about my employer specifically but yeah, I get your point. Hello, Polaris. We're having a nice day. Have you tried ice? No. Have you tried ice? No. See, okay. This is me being me. But anytime I read anything about philosophy or whatever, which I'm not sure if that really should be counted as anything in the direction of philosophy. But anytime I read theory like that, I'm just like, yeah, this is the most fucking obvious shit ever. Why do you write a book? This is just obvious, bro. So, I don't think I could stand a book like that. This is the way I feel about almost all philosophy. It's just like, okay, you're saying obvious things. Maybe it's because I'm not enough in the topic to actually know what would be considered the interesting stuff to read. I mean, I had to read a little bit of Kant for school and this is the dumbest shit ever. His stuff is not just like, okay, you're showcasing the most obvious conclusions but also you're fucking delusional and wrong about everything you say. His categorical imperative where it's just like, oh yeah, if you want to improve society, you should just always act the way you wish people would act. It's like, no? What? What are you talking about? Are you crazy? You know what happens if you always act the way that you wish other people would act? You become fucking Ned Flanders from The Simpsons. How did that work out for him? So she doesn't work. Time when, in the evening, he would discuss Marx. So, yeah. I mean, I don't know much about him but from what I have heard about his theories, it sounds like he does not respect the idea of taking a risk and that risks need to be rewarded somehow for people to be willing to take risks. But again, I have no idea. I'm literally talking out of my ass. And by risk, I mean business risk. I have a pretty good life. Did someone talk shit about me having a sad life and it got filtered out? If so, I am sorry. I wish I could read your message because that would be very funny to me. A lot of stuff is obvious to us but in their time, hundreds of years ago, it was insightful. Do you have an example, maybe? Because I have a hard time seeing what you mean. Like, I get your argument and I think there may be true value to it but I'm not 100% convinced. What's wrong with Fast64, huh? We love Fast64 in this house. We say it's the best alternative to Blender because Blenders are too resource-averse. Looking at Wings 3D by next animation. Blenders are too resource-heavy. Just give up, bro. You're lost. You can't do anything. But apparently you can install F64 renderer in Fast64 to make it less resource-heavy. I guess you can try Google Sketchup. But it's pretty awful. Yeah, Blender 4.1 is also good. Dang, okay, you guys are getting too into this conversation. This is getting heated in chat. That's not good. I just wanted to hear about funny ancient philosophy. What do you mean by full resolution? It's good, you're getting engagement. Is it the right kind of engagement though? I guess if I wanted to become a politics streamer. Dude, imagine how hard I could go on the politics streamer grift. I think I'm dictating a good result without any consideration of how to achieve the result. Dictating a good result? I see what you mean. You're saying that what is a good end goal to achieve should take into consideration the means required to achieve that goal. I have no idea how that relates to anything we're saying in chat. But I honestly disagree. Could bring S1 Gold in half like a twig? True. I could get into a heated argument with him and just start posing or something. I think people would be into that. I can't do politics because as a politics streamer you would actually have to be stupid on purpose. I think there's a selection bias going on here. Because think about it, a smart person changes their mind once they are receiving new information. But if you're a politics streamer and you ever change your mind on anything, you're going to lose a portion of your audience. So to be a successful politics streamer you have to be completely dead set on all your beliefs. Even if it's completely unfounded. So it kind of necessitates that as a politics streamer you're either grifting or stupid. I think. And if you look at what I just described and apply that to all the politics streamers, I think you can see a lot of... Oh, now it makes sense. Is my video essay on why Cobra Commander is the ideal political candidate? To me it's all nonsense because I think the system is just designed poorly right now. You gotta design a system where all the people in power are incentivized to act in a way that benefits everyone. And that's just not set up. We haven't even tried that. You need to balance the risk versus reward properly for treason. And it's not. Treason is just way too valuable right now. It's way too good of an option. And that ruins everything. If I was a politician I would fucking sell out to Big Oil Day 1. Like, don't vote for me. That would be a terrible choice. It is just the correct choice, man. Native Pala has a reticular resource of 576 pixels, while Apala have black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. Oh. So, okay, I see, I see. That's a tough question. I haven't really thought about it yet. I haven't really given a Pala version any consideration at all so far. For me Pala right now is in the background. That will have to be an afterthought. Okay. What's the button again? Alt-P? No. Ctrl-F and then P? Yeah. That's why the button moved. I think it's neat when you disenchant it. I'm sure there's neat stuff out there that if I saw it I would like it a lot. It's just that everything I've seen has been pretty depressing philosophy-wise. Depressing as in stupid, uninteresting, nonsensical. So that's sad, because I feel like it shouldn't be. If you heard the MK World Beat'em Park remix, now shall we listen to it? Let's see. MK World Beat'em Park. Don't tell me whether it's good or bad, we'll find this out together. Fucking Raving. Okay, Baby Disco. Okay. I honestly can't tell whether people are gonna love or hate this. It has shitpost vibes. Okay. Baby Park composed by Skrillex. It's definitely unique. Wub wub wub wub. But why? What do the people say about this? It's by far the funniest thing to come out of this game. EDM Baby Park. We're making it out of Kindergarten with this one. Baby Park has evolved into Teenage Dump Park. That is a crazy track. Okay. 200 tracks. Well, there's also like 100 tracks in RTYI. Actually, I think RTYI's final track count is gonna be like 120, which is crazy. They make the ground light up so evenly. Vertex colors. Okay. Looks good to me. Am I being too busy? Nope, I'm just not seeing your thing. Oh, you said look up Mario 60% redone in the search and you'll find it? You'll find what? Why would I want to look that up? I guess that's what you're waiting for. Because I have no idea what you're talking about. Arlan, what the fuck are you talking about? Okay. There's a new Albino Mario mod on the Star Wars Explorer. That does sound very funny, but it's not something I want to look up. Because I am barking. I am making things right now.  So these are Xenos products where you always have to get halfway to something. So in theory, you never touch anything unless you have to get to half of the rest. This one's really silly. Is that one of those things that now seem very obvious but back then seemed insightful? Is that one of your examples? Because even back then, I don't think anyone would have considered that very insightful.  Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm supposed to be asking you what a silly thing is? I think the first... Oh yeah, I missed your first example. Oh. I wanted to hear more examples of things that now seem obvious but back then would have seemed insightful. That is what I was asking about. Okay. It's the E button to clear seams? What the fuck? Okay. Haha. I don't get it. I think your long message was filtered out or something. I think I missed the crux of your message. Which is unfortunate. But I will agree, yeah. The scientific method maybe is not something that would seem obvious to us today but wasn't super obvious back then. That's definitely one good point.  Hello, Zayna. I'm doing some good UV mapping. Okay.  Peanut butter chocolate squares?   And I lost a lot of weight and strength recently. Just because I lost a lot of weight I also lost strength. It's a little unfortunate. Or is it a good thing? I'm not sure. I'm undecided on it. Okay. Well, every time you say, this is hard to explain, therefore God, you also have to be like, okay, but God, this is even harder to explain. How is that a good explanation? What the fuck do you mean? Also, they're committing God of the Gaps, which I think the Catholic Church actually is telling you not to do. Right? Like, that's actually banned by the church, isn't it? To do the God of the Gaps thing. Hello, Siak. Making a Siak hack together? I wasn't gonna work on a Siak hack. I'm sorry, man. Shallotier64, I know that that's a meme. A Siak? What are we making, a Siak? Okay. We're making a Siak hack. Wait, have you never seen Mario with big titties in a hot tub? In a pool? I feel like you would have liked that. Don't you see me in the pool? Maybe on my Instagram I can post that. Oh, yeah. Hmm. Well, this one can just be this. Actually, no, it can't be just this texture. This has to go into red. Okay, this is gonna be weird. And make a cave site material that works for volcanoes. Okay. What's your life without keys? Probably basically the same. We don't really need each other that much.  Do you wanna play in front of the area? I don't want to do that right now. It's a really big area. Make case memes. I'm sure you'll get some. Just subscribe on YouTube on Case Emmanuel. You'll get all the case memes you want. Okay. This looks kind of neat for lava, I think. Oops. There we go. Come to think of it, I did not really give this... Ooh. Oh, yeah, that's good. That's kinda nice. That's maybe a little much. Actually, if we do something like this... Let's scale this down. That very much gives me volcano vibes. Oops. Okay. Okay. I think this works. How terrible is your experience with Windows 11 so far? It's honestly not that different from Windows 10. I have had two blue screens. And I have had quite a few... Just the machine hanging up. Especially whenever I go into sleep mode. It seems to just crash afterwards. But other than that, it's been surprisingly tame. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I thought I would eat even more rum than Winton. I'm not sure. I wouldn't really notice that so much. It might be eating up all rum. Alright, I think all the materials are done now, except for the lava. I had a really nice lava somewhere. Where was it? Why did we have the nice lava? I think it was core 7. I got an email that's just like... Review, check this model. Do it. And then it's a 7 zip file. I'm not opening that. The hell? It's gonna be a zip bomb or something. Okay, fine. I'm downloading it. The model looks good actually. Man, the model looks great though. Wow. Fine, we're looking at the model. Just because they did such a nice job at making it. Okay. How do you fucking unzip on Windows 11? What the hell? Wait, how does this work? I guess I just have to do that.  What is this texture? Okay. Am I crazy? What is going on?  This is the model they sent me. No, it doesn't know it. Oh, there it is. How cool does that look? I think it looks very pretty. They wanted me to verify that this can run on N64. But I have my doubt about these here.  This looks like way too many settings of grayscale. A5, A5, A5. A2, A2, A2. 97, yeah. How do you set this to index colors again? Which one to next? I have no idea why they thought they could do that. Anyway, what's going wrong with this? It is not adding shade color like it... Oh, of course it should be adding shade color. Why would it be? What the fuck? Let's see, we can make this lava look better like this. He has a theme park, but it's not inside this volcano. It's inside this volcano here. There's two volcanoes on the island. This condition is identical branches. Damn, how do you set this? It doesn't like this. Oh my god, what did I do? There we go. I'm trying to get my game to zero compile warnings. So sometimes when I see a compile warning like that, I just fix it real quick. Appreciate you taking the time to stream for us and for monetary gain. Honestly, streams don't make a lot of money. I would be a lot better off just making YouTube videos. If I just made YouTube videos, I think I could pretty easily get like... Just from YouTube videos, maybe like 60,000-70,000 a year. Maybe I should do that, man. That's a fuckton of money. But I don't want to. This looks cool. God, I love this lava. This lava texture looks so good. This peak. Remember how we changed my sorcerer? I have no idea what you're talking about. I think you're just being crazy. I don't see a Luigi. Okay, so this needs to have the train station. I guess that's our next work. Make a little train station. We can just copy one from the level. Holy fuck, I got Luigi? How did I unlock Luigi? Was he always in the game? How did that happen? No way.  I remember when just grilling was a meme. It would say just chill and grill. I don't care what's going on. 0x4d What is going to cause some insight? 0x3c Zero. This is four. No wonder it crashed. It would be so funny if Luigi was in any way, when I had this stupid ass unlocker, and liked the theories back in the day. True. That would actually go hard. If we can't do multiplayer, we definitely should do that. Anyway, I think I'm done for today. And I will see you guys in the next stream. Probably on Saturday. Also, in I think two weeks, I'll be off work. So there might be like a full two weeks of streams. Which would be hype as fuck. We will probably finish the overworld in those two weeks. So until then, bye bye.
