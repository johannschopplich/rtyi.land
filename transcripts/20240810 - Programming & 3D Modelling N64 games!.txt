Hello? Hello? No, no. Ew, ads. Hello, Zainab. You're still getting ads even though you're subscribed. Thank you very much, Twitch. Let me just get my setup ready here. Hello, Liliana. Miss Vuvu. I'll see Meowdy in eight seconds. Meowdy, partner. Hello, Super Mario Bros. 123, World 64, Game Boy. Meowdy, partner. There we go. Hello, Xlinks. Someone got it right. I know. I knew exactly what it stood for. Hello, ads. You got a MacBook ad before the stream? Awesome. I hope you had a good time with that. Look what I did the last week or so. Wait, why is the hitbox not working? Or hurtbox? Or is it working and I just threw that? The hurtbox is not working anymore. What the fuck? Hello, Voxy. Voxy William. Is that a Five Nights at Freddy's character? Yeah, this doesn't work anymore. What the fuck? What? Why is this not working? What LST do we pick for today?  Let's see here. Do we have any special wishes? Yoshi's Island OST? All right. Oh, man. This is so short. It's just 36 minutes.   Oh, is he no longer being positioned for the hitbox? That's probably it. Let's test this right here. Let me just try something. This should not make him work, but it might. If it does, then I'm confused and I have to figure out why. Rate your current pain on a scale of 1 to 10. Four. Actually, eight. I'm in mental pain because of bureaucracy. No, that wasn't it. Cool, cool, cool. I'm just going to have him print his Y position so I can get a guess of where he is. More rest must be the answer or build more character. No, the answer is fixing all my bureaucracy bullshit. That is the only answer. No, his Y position seems right. Hello, Kitsune. Is there maybe an issue here? This is animation not playing. What is the planet you're on? Moon. What's the receipt program on C++? Are you ready for assembly? Assembly is simple, just very difficult. We can start with assembly. Nope, that didn't hit at all. Cool. You guys have no idea how fucked programming this was. They don't have velocities, they have turn speeds. I think Zeyna made it. I just made some small changes to make sure it works better here. For my purposes. Yeah, so somehow I broke the explosive meteor and I'm not sure how. Cool, cool. Is it no longer setting default velocity? I will just... Let's see what this prints. This is the distance between the meteor and Raphael Raven. Did he edit the video? No, Okayo did. It's someone I paid to edit the video. And hopefully he can edit the next few videos for me. Did I even compile? Wait, what? It's decreasing the distance as it should. So what must be wrong is the scale. That makes sense, because I did make some changes to the scale. Yeah, this is the issue. This should do it. You could make squishing feel a lot more powerful by squishing the screen horizontally like this. Oh, you mean like when you take damage? Yeah, that would be very cool. I'm seeing a 50% mark. No, it didn't. The scale of Raphael Raven was too small. He was scaling down so far that his hitbox was 0. Just this visual model doesn't match the scale yet, because I don't actually scale this model yet. There we go. You see how he took damage? Dude, Biobak, you can make this fight look so fucking cool with the background. Imagine the whole background here just rotating around. How cool is that gonna be? I also want him to get bigger on every hit. Come on. God damn it. Yeah, if he gets bigger, he's gonna be a little easier to hit. Right now, every time you hit him, he speeds up a little bit and he starts spawning more sharp waves faster. Hitting him is difficult at this stage. But if I scale him up, surely it'll be easier. Come on. Nope. I wanna just kill him once, please. Yeah, okay. Make him roll. Oh yeah, he should just do a 360 spin when he gets hit. That would be funny. Yes, it doesn't have any damage. I don't know how to do animations yet. We're working on it. Yeah, the boss is a huge pile of poop. You got that right. You know what the most fucked up part about being a famous romaker is? When people harass me about the release date and I tell them that I want the whole family to...  I am the bad guy. You have that for the death animations? Yeah, I think it would look cool for the hits if you just did a 360 spin. Let's remove the points again, because we don't need them anymore. Let's program him scaling up next. I'm thinking every time someone does that, I will just respond with a lowercase xd. I think that's the optimal response here. And I want everyone else to just come and laugh at this user or something like that. Let's play for the hub world for a sec. The hub world is gonna be Yoshi's Island, of course. You know the Maori Party Board? Yoshi's Tropical Island, where there's fruits everywhere? I want it like that. And the idea is that with the coins that you buy, you can unlock global power-ups too. Or not global power-ups, you can unlock progression in the overworld. So maybe you can pay someone to build a bridge, or you can pay someone so that they can buy a tree or something, and then you can climb on that. This is course 13. Do you think course 13 is gonna be the final level, when there's 15 courses in Mario 64? Hungover stream? I never drink, so there would never be a hungover stream. Okay, so in his third animation, he's gonna scale up. This way, he's gonna have a scale of 1.6 at the end, which I think might be a bit much. Let's try something else. Something about Yoshi's Island, I guess that's gonna be the final level. Oh no, that's the overworld! Are you still with Zinnia? No? I've never known a Zinnia in my life. Do you mean Zayna? That's not Zayna.  All right, now you should be scaling up. Oh yeah, by the way, let me show you the intercuts in fully. So we have the moon, you see the moon, there is the moon, and then this guy slowly comes up, his animation is going to change, his eyes are going to be closed, and then he opens his eyes, and he jumps, and voom, he changes the gravity, Mario flies to the moon, he follows, and now Mario goes, aha, and the fight starts. Oh, he did get bigger, nice, nice, that should make hitting him a little bit easier, I hope. I feel like I should put some coins on the moon too, although then I have to program coins on the moon. I could also make the meteors go for a little longer to make this easier. Dude, that's fucked up, the comments I get on my YouTube is either like, oh wow, this level looks way too easy, or oh wow, this level looks way too hard. No one ever says Kaze, the difficulty of this looks perfect to me. There's people out there going like, Kaze is making games for babies now, and then there's people just like, oh man, Kaze is always so difficult, that's why I don't play them. Come on, this could be the hit, but yeah, if I'm struggling this much, it's way too difficult. Oh, he died, okay, cool. Hello Hoshi, so it's only on the moon in the end, yeah, I should actually model some holes and make it look like a normal moon. I mean, I don't want to have to program that. When you throw rocks, you get coins from it, oh, that would be neat, yeah, yeah, I don't hate that, but still, I have to program the coins to actually work on the moon. I feel like this heart box didn't actually scale with the scale, let me just fix that. I mean, obviously it didn't, I just realized I never even programmed that. I can make it easier by having him stop periodically, maybe after he does a shockwave attack. He slows down after every shockwave attack, he used to stop fully, and then I just made it so that he only slows down. It's very hard to find the correct velocity there, because if you set it to 0, the fight is laughably easy, and if you set it like what I have right now, it's a little too hard. I think we do the pattern to increase trick, and what we do is we make it slower the longer the fight goes. That way, everyone is guaranteed to beat eventually, sounds good, from serveredited, what makes you think that devs don't know about randomizations? Well, there was one person on the team that knew about random matrices, and they fucked up because they put the camera onto the model matrix stack, but I think that the vast majority of programmers at Nintendo did not know, because 3D was super new, it actually would be crazy if they knew. Am I allowed to make fun of me? You are allowed to make fun of me as much as you want, as long as you're not being annoying. But usually someone making fun of me is not annoying, someone asking for release dates is annoying. Is that camera aberration? Is your face actually like that? Let me see. I don't know what camera aberration means. Alright, let's also slow him down depending on how many shockwave attacks he already did. For that i need a good variable we have opacity used i think we have numlootcoins used we do maybe to put the title of the music on a corner of the screen nope they called you beautiful i think really that's actually a funny thing one time i have sent a selfie to someone and that person accused me of editing my selfie to make my skin look smooth which was very funny and then she was very jealous of how smooth and nice my skin is what can i say man i just have perfect skin oh i can't use anim stick because we need it for the eyes if you make it based on time it will just get easier if you make it based on players life and scale how much trouble the user is having time pretty much corresponds to how much trouble the user is having and i don't want to make it so that it's actually like how do i put this you know how when you play games and there's like a level system in the games and then the enemies scale to your own level and it's like leveling makes no sense anymore that's that's how i feel about scaling it by health that's why i want to scale it by time you know what i'm using b perm for fuck it that should do it now it's going to get very easy over time and you should have said books do you have plans to work on a new original game after release of this game like a renew but yeah look at this at zero life he does stop fully after doing a shark wave attack and then after that he moves with like eight velocity i made him get his color only after he does the stomp so that the effect that you want in biomech can be made you see how he fully stops right now again what is he doing bro he bucked out yeah the hitbox is fine now but somehow he bucked out and I'm not sure why Tony doesn't need to be there for to be used for anything oh wait I know why this is why which means that was working as soon as I'm missing the cool effect from the intro I'm still planning to put that in Biobak look at this wait we have the moon here and then we have this camera perspective and he's not obviously not gonna do this animation right he's just gonna come up with this eyes closed and then like once he's over here he's gonna like open his eyes and jump on so that's it's a hundred percent planned in that's why I haven't paid for him like black to purple oh what the fuck was that I got floating air okay this seems like a reasonable difficulty now or in galaxy 64 is real yeah very very real this effect for the moon would look so much better if there was more in the skybox not the thing you were thinking of oh yeah with something in the skybox like that thing it looks so much better I'm just gonna put some stars in the background maybe use the the good old Yoshi's Island night sky effects Aurora Borealis okay what's next on my to-do list here for this fight we definitely need to spawn a pipe to get back afterwards we need the raven egg to actually move around and we need the pipe when he dies to attach properly and we need the animations let me just actually make him die now I don't actually know what this is but I know plants only 0x16 do you like the new Wikipedia dark mode I don't use Wikipedia game show thinking as music crew this is game show music this is such a good song dude the Yoshi's Island OST is so good makes you think of Trihex dude I miss when Trihex was speedrunning Yoshi's Island and I think he stopped a while ago didn't he I think so at least I haven't seen him play Yoshi in a long time oh yeah we also need him flying to the moon properly but yeah you see how the egg there you see the egg in the background just like moving around when I move Mario that's because I am matrix animated at the end wait he ran it at AGDQ 24 shit maybe that was just a period where he didn't run Yoshi and I should stop paying attention to him this is not a very best way to matrix animate this egg we can get the home pose and use that as a transformation matrix input a translation matrix multiply that with a quaternion that corresponds to its rotation towards the moon and that should work any objections no this actually can work for everything geo fixated actor I'm making a close castle moon transition and it might be a bit of work but it will look so cool you have to other option but to accept it castle to moon transition oh I see okay so the plan is back up the position into our home of our translation mother also yes no no we don't actually need to compute the quaternion because the quaternion is always the same if we can just regenerate from the home so that's good that's weird though isn't that same thing twice we get translation matrix from our home multiply by current and rotation positions back into a thing over right that's that that's the idea evil plan I like it this is evil yes but you have to be able to make this shit work and we need this matrix here it's to be in the chain equals this so that that's here and then we change all next sequence in the chain of sex so we can no longer keep the home used which I know unfortunate but we don't need it here so that's cool we can also buy the store the points what happened if you use a method set of math for code you probably would get not very far already mentioned in this video, I'm going to show you how to move the coins into the coordinate system of the planet and then with how much the planet moves you need to move the coins like that much in the coordinate system of the planet I'm not sure what I mean by the model projection world matrix the model projection world matrix what is that what's the name of the planet the whole thing is just an illusion I think the egg might work now I made it up ahh what did you guys think of the editing on the new video lol you liked it? yches lol lol that was pretty funny loll way to go yches lmao yay lmao nice lmao lmao lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol lol        lol lol lol I also should update the position Like so Okay, so we got the egg Next we need a pipe that is also fixated on the moon The problem with the pipe is How we gonna make sure that the rotation is right Do we have to back up a rotation matrix gathered from Raphael Raven What if we just keep the Raven around and use the Raven matrix or the Raven quaternion? Yeah, that's fine Aayla As long as you're playing the game about 30 FPS and this won't go below that so Well, actually even if you go below 30 FPS it wouldn't be a big deal Right, this is just a physical position Hmm Yeah, the problem with the pipe is additionally it needs to be Rotated correctly like we need to find the initial rotation. So that's pointing away from the moon. I Guess we can just force it to be something sensible We actually need to force it with something sensible because this rotation It's not purely visual. Oh, shit. Let's program a press L to kill the raven, just so we can do this correctly, easily. Wait, is this the right action? Yeah, okay. Just so you guys can see what it would look like if we spawned a coin. This is what would happen unless we did some special programming. It would do this. We're never gonna get there. Wait, what, why? Um, it's very complicated. The rock also again, because the rock is specifically programmed to work. Wait, what the fuck? All the scuttle family is here? Well, we can delete that. And the Dolphinum backgrounds. And try not to crackplate. I need a new folder, please. One by one. And non-Euclidean pipe. Wait, it didn't compile anything. Okay. There we go. Oh, God. You wanna sleep? Too bad, I guess.  Good evening.  Yeah. Huh, the wallpipe is missing handles. That's not good. Good evening. But this fixed the issue. Yeah. Nope. Cool, cool, cool. Also, the Dolphinum BG. Yeah, it's just the wallpipe now. With this compile. Yeah, that works. Okay, so somehow we need to gain access to these. How do I include this? What the hell? What is your full-time job? Is there something you're doing right now? My full-time job is being a programmer. There we go. Okay, now we should have a pipe that spawns. And we can move. But it should be rotated wrong. Yeah, I work in video game development full-time. Why is the pipe already there? I don't get it.     Wrong model ID. That's why. Yes, the egg just hatched into a pipe. The egg just hatches into a star. There is a pipe here. And when you beat him, there is going to be a pipe spawning on the thing here. And on the planet. And you go into the pipe to go back. And then you can ground pound the egg to get the star. Where did the pipe go? I don't get it.  Do you know what context do you load area? Does that even exist? Now that I think about it. Is the object even set at that point? That doesn't make any sense, does it? Make that egg? Shouldn't make a difference. Still. Interesting. I don't think the flag never moved us anything. Unused idea, yeah. Not here. Nice castle. Yeah, we don't want to set the home actually. Because it's just spooky and it shouldn't work. And the fact that it did work was a bug. Okay, we have a pipe spawning. But the position of the pipe makes no sense. Okay. The pipe needs a rotation. That corresponds to how the raven is rotated now. That's going to be the difficult part. Because practically that means we would need to convert Coternion to Euler. Or which doesn't really work properly all the time. Because rotation order bullshit. I tried to use the Unreal Engine 5 method actually and it did not work. So what I'm thinking is. We can just use. The position to get. A pitch and a jaw. That points outwards from the planet. And because it's cylindrical. It will not matter. That's my thought process here. Let me see what Biomex ideas. Let me just. Case moon. Oh. But wait. That's completely incompatible with the other idea. You had Biomex. How is he going to obstruct the moon if we do this? He was supposed to block the moon with his face. Thank you for the prime. Gizzy Leon. That's when he sends you to the moon. I don't understand. How can he block. Isn't he supposed to block the moon with his body. And like make the whole thing go black. And then you like see his eyes pop up. And that's the oh shit moment. And then there's like a secondary moon up in the sky. So we have two moons. We can find something. I mean I have Mario move on the parabola here right. That was my idea. The cobot is the blur in the start. Yeah I'm up for the blur. We can do that. But it would be Mario moving from here to here. Right now I just have Mario like spin on the parabola and get there. I was going to have him also like spin and land here. So it's kind of your idea but horizontal. It's important to me Andrew. Because. Because otherwise you can't find the pipe. But it's okay. It's not going to be that difficult. I'm thinking this might already do the trick. I'm not sure about the most cinematic ones. There's stuff like the conker's poop boss. By the way the crash here is normal and expected. Don't worry about that. Still weird. It's something with this approach wrong. And I'm not seeing it. Surely I don't need to additionally do some quaternion multiplication. That would be ridiculous right? The up vector is a good emergency solution though. If I have to go with it. Hmm. How does this work out practically? Aren't they applied in a different order? And I need to not get these two. I think that might be the problem. I think the rotation order might be pitch and then jaw. Instead of jaw and then pitch. Which would lead to this issue. I do work out. Maybe that's why you think I'm hot. You gotta take care of your body. If you wanna take care of your mind. That's my thought process. Hmm. Hmm. Man I really thought this would work. Is there a better way? Do I have to just spawn it at the top? Or without a pipe? I could just spawn it in the cutscene. I could just. Move Mario back without a pipe. What if we just move Mario back without a pipe. And we just have him float over here. A nice skyloft. Just a little bit of gambling. And getting drunk in a visual novel. Doesn't seem that bad. Seems pretty standard. How else can we get Mario back to the tower. Without him looking weird. I think the pipe sucks. It sucks programming wise. And it's also not really very visually clear. Why that would happen. Hmm. Make a trampoline. Hmm. Hello Baker. Welcome back Rain. Zayna. Baker haven't you. Dude you were big here. A few years ago. And then you've been gone for such a long time. Rain is with you too? Nice. Oh. On one hand yes cool. On the other hand I don't want to reference Mario Galaxy even more. With this fight. I don't want people thinking of Mario Galaxy with this. This is Yoshi's Island. How's it going? Good. So we're just brainstorming how to get back off the moon. After you beat the boss here. I really like the primitive color effects here. What a stupid way to die.  Everyone will think of Mario Galaxy when they see this. But it's Yoshi's Island. This is very clearly a Yoshi's Island boss fight. Think of Mario Galaxy wrong. N64 cannot do upscale textures. Wing cap ride the meteor. Don't bring Mario back bring the egg to him as a meteor. That would kind of be funny. If after the boss fight we just put Mario up here. And removed the planetary gravity. Like what if after this. It was just a normal ass planet. And you have to fly back with the wing cap. Although you might not have the wing cap unlocked at this point. I don't know about that. Hello Sonic the Hedgehog. Have a nice day. Having a big door grow out of nowhere. That takes you back. Yep this is what the eyes look like. You can use the part of this for Mario. Shooting him back. Makes no sense to enter lack of gravity. yeah. if she's at that point let me see what yoshi's island does. yeah this guy looks just very temporary right now. oh this is how yoshi gets me. just with some good old yoshi magic. we can't do that. it's too stupid. just stay on the moon and get the star here. honestly that might be our best option. like maybe you beat him and the egg hatches and you just get the star. moon jumping on the moon. can you just make a pipe come out of the ground like in galaxy? it's possible but it requires some pretty stupid math and i don't really want to do that. i also don't really like that idea. then it'll be a z bank. i'm thinking the egg hatches and you get the star here. someone donated? make a dose thank you for the two dollars. very appreciated. what is this? two doubloons. if you mario on the moon you can despawn the actual platform which will allow the skirmish to be unobscuring and give it more space. no i like that. it feels very spacey this way. you know what i'm just gonna spawn the star on top of the moon. i think that's the easiest way to do it. money! is that what he said? okay. do you know what? if someone figures out a way to ground pound the egg without triggering the bossfight before then they deserve to just get the star like that and skip the bossfight i don't even think that's a good idea a beautiful cat scene awesome cool perfect just what i wanted cool what if the game is done? um just over 80 percent okay it's too low and it needs the specifier we had some faq comments but the bots kept malfunctioning hello aleffy? genki? you speaking japanese to me? what does that word mean? genki dama is like spirit bomb so you either said spirit or you bomb genki means happy wait so the genki dama is the happy bomb? okay we gotta spawn a star without doing this this will be interesting first asking if you're doing well in the donation would be healthy okay but what does this have to do with the genki dama from dragon ball? if you multiply it by 4 people do you think the whole project would be done 400% faster? no maybe like 320% i don't like when people say oh but nine women can make one baby in one month well nine babies can make nine and nine women can make nine babies a lot faster than one woman can make nine babies think about it you can multi-threat making babies pretty well that's like a terrible example you could say three musicians can't play one music piece in a third of the time which is true but that's very different what do you call those idioms? fables? i hate those dude they're the worst do do do do do do do do do do do do do do what how are you watching me i think i was pretty clear on what i said do you're gonna lock the babies otherwise a woman tries to access us while the baby is gonna crash true yes fables stories in which animals can talk okay but it's not just stories in which animals can talk it's stories made up to convey a certain moral and why does it not work i know why i know why i know why i know why this is why do do do oh yeah this is not difficult what the f**k what the f**k what just happened where's this coming from did someone donate and i missed it oh god let me just log into the stream labs lol xt um let me just figure out how to skip this oh god um f**k life actions um god damn it where's the skip button fellas i can't find the skip button it says yoy xt tip one dollars for crazy bus there we go reina hates this it's fair do do congratulations we now know reina hates crazy bus did you make my daughter cry with your crazy bus dude that's f**ked up that's what you did do let's just make sure this works make sure this function gets called when just printing something to the screen when it does we like to play the split screen hack on calarin and play with russian and draw any chance to try a split screen hack um it seems unlikely right now there's a chance but like no guarantee yeah the function isn't being called at all huh but i clearly linked this here do why is it like that well the story as far as i'm aware is that they meant to do like a pentatonic scale and it was not programmed as a pentatonic scale so it's just all over the place do how do you edit endless um if you want personalized coaching by me you will have to pay do  it's probably this it's definitely this do i have an idea this is pretty jank i need to do something like this here do i'm so looking forward to the mario party soon oh my god i want to just play the mario party and eat chocolate cake and drink chocolate milk wow oh yeah yeah yeah yes interesting  very interesting let me just set the timer to 20 here check at which point it crashes just so we know exactly which part is crashing  okay so it crashes as soon as this activates do just making sure this is set how you do this on n64 it's really not that difficult other people have invented this before me you just need some quaternions and then you can actually just google everything it's just like you just rotate the quaternion to the vector that mario moved and then you just multiply everything and have everything in a model matrix if you watch my newest video here's my plug if you watch my newest video and you know a little bit about quaternions you can do this too so oh well this would definitely cause some issues is that the reason the pipe didn't work because i had the old pointer instead of the obj pointer is that the whole reason oh my god we could have just gone with the pipe it probably is the reason why why so well yeah there's a bug here and as soon as the bug is fixed i don't need the safety check so  this works just fine for the normal wait a second this does something weird with the home coordinates does it not it does oh the home is here oh but that should be fine  it's this part that seems to cause the crash right what if i just remove this again Wait, where did the star go now? Didn't the star stay before, just like above mario? Where did it go? We do need this just to be safe here, because anything can actually just be like offscreen and we don't want that to happen. Now it disappeared, yeah. It's still disappearing. And then it crashed. Does this not return the object pointer? It should. Let me just make sure this actually like prints too, because it looks like this pointer is null, which it should never be, by the way. Yeah it didn't print anything, even though we clearly assigned it here. Oh, because of this. That makes a lot of sense. I think now it will work. Yeah okay. It was two codes I wrote to control star just showing up on screen that were just fighting with each other. Because I have two different types of spoof stars here, and I just made sure that one at a time works instead of both together. So this should be fucked for 20 frames and then it should just... Okay, interesting. Wait, no, it stopped moving with me. Wait, that was perfect. Wait, that's what we wanted. Right? Yeah! Yeah! The star is now in world space. Perfect. Perfect.  This is what I wanted. All right, we got the star working. Well, he dies as soon as I press L, because that's my cheat code. All right. We did it, boys. Raphael the Raven is no more. Next step. Make sure that Raphael moving to the planet is fine. Can you... Yeah, sure. I'll just restart from course one. Everything will now be on planets. Fuck it. My stars do look a little more golden than the vanilla, so I think... Let's make a scene making the egg explode. The egg does explode. It just needs like a better animation. I shouldn't add this part here. Which one's a good one? Four? I should keep the cheat code so I can speedrun it faster before Simple eventually breaks it. Yep. There you can see it explode. Oh, that's ugly. What was that? Did you see that too? So it always goes exactly at the top of this thing here. We can compute where that position is at the moment and spawn it over there. Do we always spawn it above Mario or do we always spawn it at the top of the planet? I think both are viable options here. No, it always places itself at the top of the planet, even if you're at the bottom, right? So it would just move 180 degrees, which is the problem here. So this is above Mario's position, but then as soon as we assign this, it would be wrong. So the inverse of the planet rotation, I think. Okay. The camera clip into the moon is spawned on top of the planets. Is it not spawned on top of the planet? It shows the whole planet and the starting position. Yeah, that's possible. Well, let's first get the position right and then we can think about more stuff. I think I might have to invert this rotation, but let's just try it for now. I need to throw away matrices. Yeah, I think I might have to invert that quick onion, but let's just first see if I do, because I'm not 100% sure. It would spawn directly over Mario, and then I think it's gonna move exactly... Wait, is this exactly the middle again? Oh, I need to use this thing here. So I think, since now I'm like 20 degrees rotated forward, I think it would snap back like 40 degrees back. What the fuck? That is 100% not what I expected to happen. Interesting. Oh, because I used O again. Yeah, I was using the X position again. It was rotated back, so I was right about that. I think it's like... Okay, perfect. I just need to invert this for turning here. Quaternion, invert, planet. Since this is a normalized quaternion, I can just use the conjugate. Use your hands, don't jump off the planet and just die. Yeah, good luck on that. And now I think it's directly above Mario. Come on. What? It's still here? Oh, oops, I forgot the minus symbol. How does the boss fight happen? He stomps the floor, which makes a shockwave and meteors appear. What's the exact same bonus before? I just forgot the minus symbol. There we go. Now it's perfect. Ain't that nice? Oh, I like how you can see the underside of the star from here. Oh, that's so cool. All right. Now we need the raven to also probably land on the planet. We can't just have him snap there. I'm applying for an international scholarship in the US, teach me math. Nope. Too much mint? Nah, this is a good amount of mint. Should be finishing them soon. Baby, just... All right. Good luck on... Have I told you guys yet that Brawl is the best Super Smash Bros. game? Maybe it's the best Super Smash Bros. sport. I'll agree with you there. That's a crazy take. I think it's a good one. I've heard Mario's song. Probably one of the Yoshi's Island ones. Right, so here he should be flying over to the moon. We can compute his gore position from the Quaternion near Siren Head's birth. And then Pidge and Jarl we can just do whatever the fuck. Because it just has to be good enough. And he's going to be rotating anyway, so we can just do whatever the fuck.    Anyway, like Mario does. Yeah, well, hopefully it's not too much trial and error. I feel like most of the time we got a pretty good grasp of the situation. How does he fly without wings? He's a bird. Duh. I played Smash Remix on a real console. It was very cool. The one thing about Smash Remix on a real console is that it's very laggy. But we're going so deep on the stack on this function. Put off had more ponies. Put off. They can't fly either. They just don't want to. Varus and Melee just because there would have been Varus in that representationless moveset. Yeah, Varus would have been a good addition to Melee. I want to know how long this action state is. Because I never actually think this is a weird action state. It's like 154.  The serious opposition. I don't think he dodged. I've been thinking I should make a lot more videos. I'm gonna make more money for my family. I'm thinking I will just pump out a lot of videos. Stuff like how does the BLG in R64 work? Or how do the paintings work? You know, shit like that. How does Mip's clip work? Stuff that is not super insane tech stuff but that might have a massive view. What do you guys think? You think that has potential? Especially now that I have a video editor. Wouldn't make it very easy to do. Hmm. It looked like he got pretty close but he wasn't quite there. Oh yeah, the new editing is so clean. I do like it. What's that song? It's Melee's version of this. The Melee version of this is terrible. They really butchered the DK rip. The last part is the worst. I've caught up with Pannenkoek before. Do you not remember the ABC trials? Miss Craig Z. Kong just digs this tune. This sucks dude okay that looked pretty smooth just the way the cutscene looks is not good we gotta follow our guys more take it to the fridge dude, trust64 put this thing back even though i removed it thank you very much yep, it is the yoshi's island box that looked terrible it's difficult to do because mario is flying so much faster than him i think smoothstep is the wrong function here maybe something like that just some random math i just made up wait, did i fuck this up? would be this well i mean there's a whole video i made about that that should no longer be a controversial take that's not good this is x to the power of 0.5 what if we do like x to the power of 1.5 and this multiplied by this and then square root of that and then min 1.5 and this this looks like it has potential to me summation better to do in the end or during the making of the game depends on your goals okay i think the the curve that he moves on is pretty good now just the cutscene curve here is not good like the way it doesn't really look at them until the end i don't like that maybe something like this works better yeah we're definitely adding camera shakes don't worry we just haven't really gotten to that part yet of course we're gonna add vfx sfx and camera effects like that but you gotta do one thing first and then the other same with animations the guy doesn't even have animations yet okay i like the beginning i think like this seems decent this emphasizes like flying away from this thing and then the turnaround is a little fast i think the turnaround would be fine if the characters were still in focus what if i add like a bigger point here and meet this camera here go like here let's try that this making cutscenes like this sucks we're going to send those marfields and beards well that's kind of how it works though right in the original yoshi's islands he just changes the gravity for everyone i have not done ps1 now  hmm i guess it's just a trial and error stream wait doing ps1 is illegal? that sucks i have thought about making my own n64 game but that would be a lot of work if i did that i would probably like do an n64 game and um a game i can sell on steam at the same time and then the n64 game would be like a big advertisement point so should the focus be lower should the camera be further away i think that's the question i think maybe the cutscene should focus more on the moon itself and less on mario so now we go from focusing on mario to focusing on the moon and both of them let's try that can't resist really limit the potential of the n64 so many people say that but i mean sure if you want to do stream to music yes but if not then like it doesn't really matter if you look at my rom sure my rom right now is like 62.6 megabytes but if you take a closer look then like 50.6 megabytes of that is just music so if i just did like a normal thing and non-stream music my rom would be like 12 megabytes like fifth of the size oh that was terrible oh god what happened there this should be further away yep making cutscenes sucks mario 64 sucks as well this man is speaking back to power um if you had access to physicality to do this i could potentially use that for experience only in the games no um if i use the disc i wouldn't be able to stream music from memory anymore because the disc is too slow so at that point i wouldn't need any storage space anymore okay i like that i think this works oh the fact that i bump and slide off the island what a shitty sounds like you ran into um how do the kids call it skill issues  how do you avoid getting involved in the fourth kilobyte t-man and you don't avoid that you use it all the time okay let's think about this he is facing that way and in the end he's facing this way and his pitch goes from neutral to like this right which is let's say 0x1800 so pitch to go 0x1800 we need this over 135 frames let's say we want this pitch to rotate like once so we want them to 0x11800 divided by 135 um so plus equals 531 we also want this one to go a bit and then afterwards we can just raise it to zero yeah we want this i think two rotations so 0x8000 and that's 1214 let's try this 3x7007 skill issues wow my youtube chat and my twitch chat are beefing with each other right now oh my god speaking of beef you guys heard the new mr beast thing it's over it's the end mr beast is finished we are never coming back anyone else is there shit i can't find the youtube channel right now but mr beast is so over it's the end for mr beast mr beef yeah the allegations no way i look like mr beast oh no wait i want to show you guys how bad that really is it got worse it's bad the end it's done finally over he's done it's over chris light it's over 12 videos or 15 i don't remember it's so over guys hmm parody one of these videos for these clips well this is the thing that you can't parody because people are really upset over this we were just making more money with the hype nobody actually cares about it obviously people seem to care about it mario does a u-turn when you want to walk backwards really he doesn't do that for me creeper creeper look what's happening for me he turns just fine are you playing the game wrong creeper maybe a cartridge is like broken are you sure why does it work on my end so yeah so i think i don't even know what that word means never heard of gas lighting  that study has been posted on the internet since i was like a child people have been saying mario 64 increases brain matter for like 20 years now what was the first mention of this here's one from 2017 surely i can find an older one here's one from 2014 so that's 10 years this is posted like once a year and then everyone loses their shit over it 2013 can we go further back no i can only go back to 2013 yo mr g day thank you for the rate of a shit ton of people um let me just do one thing real quick and then i'll show you what we're working on i'm working on something very very cool it's not perfect right now but i don't know what Biobak said but i bet it was something good look there's the moon and there's the raven from yoshi's island oh no what is he up to he sees us and um he wants to protect his egg so he jumps on the platform and shoots us to the moon and now we're fighting him on the moon dang that guy was really salty on mario 64 why doesn't the egg jump because he wants to protect the egg i don't want to make a metroid team i don't like metroid the third hit on the most is actually kind of difficult hey we beat them is it space poop no it's rafael the raven from yoshi's island so what we're working on right now is the cutscene where the raven and mario go to the moon he needs an animation still i think that's going to look really good once he has a proper animation i think we're done anything i'm missing well actually yeah his death animation sucks right now yeah zena is currently working on all the animations we need vfx sfx and camera shakes and stuff like that you sent the animations okay um unfortunately that's gonna be a next time thing because it's getting late it's 4 10 here i will be going offline for now maybe big maybe big maybe there will be a bonus stream this week maybe on my rest day which would be um monday i think so yes i will see you guys raven moon animation i will see you guys in the next stream bye
