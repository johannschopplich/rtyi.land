Hello, Fear of Darkness, hello to James L. We are working on more fruits actually. Banana, apple, strawberry, honey melon, normal melon is next. Man, this honey melon looks a lot better than I remember it being yesterday. So Hello, Clayman. Okay, so update. Update what? Did you fix the bug already? Or what do you mean by update? Hello, Abaddon. You think maybe, you don't know. Okay, Lena, this is a stupid question, but how do I update? What is the correct way to update? Because I'm pretty sure it's not just like, references fast64 and hit the update button, right? That's branch. I checked in fast64 in the branches section and there were no branches. Something is weird about github like that. So I think I have to go to merge request or pull request as they call it and then I find it um but after stream I'm gonna be out for sushi so it is going to be a while before I can try it unfortunately. Yeah, yeah, don't worry, I get it. It's just annoying to find the link. All right, I will keep that link on hinge. So what do you guys think is the best fruit in the world? It's watermelon. Sorry, I didn't, I didn't give you guys a chance to give the wrong answer. So this is actually great, holy shit. Caracara oranges. Fair enough. Mango and watermelon. I hate mango, man. Friendly mercury. I don't think that, I don't think that's a fruit. So I don't know what's mangoes but I heard they are an AQ yeah it really sucks that mangoes are an AQ I would probably eat more if they weren't an AQ I would eat more if they weren't an AQ what is an AQ? a quiet taste oh I see I don't know if I believe in a quiet taste ha 0-6-8 you who turned you into an rgba 16 how to pick this from it is off weird dead chat today did I start stream too late did everyone think I wasn't gonna stream today because I was late because I was talking to my mama on my phone you guys gonna make me regret talking to my mama on my phone this is not where I'm supposed to be man now that the overworld is starting to look like something I'm starting to like feel something for the overworld you know what I mean starting to feel right your legs don't hurt what from I had to find the stick in you what happened did you have to walk the stairs okay my reply um it's an accessibility option I figured we should make it so that even bad players can play the game so you can just cheat in this game do you think I read gems you had to walk 14 kilometers we'll make you walk 14 kilometers it's a nice thing to do some of them are nice looking the strawberry stuff like poop walk 14 kilometers to go vote today they made you walk 14 kilometers to vote I smell vote manipulation bro they're trying to kill your demographic 14 kilometers is completely unreasonable hello Sam you hope you're well homie I am homie okay so the idea here was that you could hit a red coin switch and then red coins would appear and you have to platform through them um I think we also want grapes here and an orange I think Yoshi's eat oranges right I'm going to say this for a while why don't you make the outer edge of the island more pale and sun bleached while the inner part of the island is more saturated colored um no reason I haven't thought about it let's get an orange too and then we move on to actually making the beach look like something yeah not giving people the option to vote online is fucked up what the fuck what's this game called strawberry short ah strawberry shortcake is bad memories do not say strawberry shortcake around me I'm traumatized so wait why because when we were at that wedding we had strawberry shortcake and it was a fucking piece of white bread with a little bit of whipped cream and the fucking strawberry on it so and it evokes memories of being hungry at the stupid wedding that I didn't want to go to I'm never going to a wedding again it's not bad it was partying sure buddy whatever you say buddy this is kind of a terrible orange I think we can do a much better one okay that looks terrible how is this what that's not what an orange looks like yeah you see this do you see the dimples and shit we're doing that fuck you do not invite me for strawberry shortcake do not invite me for strawberry shortcake do not invite me for strawberry shortcake  the day I ate strawberry shortcake this is genuinely one of the worst days of my life so should the orange just do anything I don't think so sorry this might be important nope hmm history of mario party sources are some good looking fruits true but I don't think they're in 64 already so today I spent all morning re-importing all the assets from course 6 into mario 64 and somehow that fixed a bunch of bugs with course 6 something about the old way of fast 64 conversion must have been completely incompatible with the engine which is weird it shouldn't be happening bleed you probably used old bleed I think the level was last exported like 2022 so that seems unlikely so big dream this is not what I want let me think about it again I want this one here oh god that's a fucked up oh my god why are all my yeah okay I know why they're all fucked up it's because they're all weird reflection stuff let's just import two textures look at what they look like and then make a call I don't know wait someone did something beta thank you for the long ass subscription welcome back big dream which one of these looks like orange skin I think I need something completely different here but I'm gonna use this as a test texture for now pretty sure we need to make a texture my ice maker says vinegar dude Zayna cleaned the coffee machine with vinegar yesterday and it was unbearable living in that room I hate vinegar smell I am so sensitive to smells holy shit I'm a little snowflake so so how does this make any sense i don't see it What if, okay wait, we have our normal texture, this is our normal texture, then we have the lighting and then for the reflection we have combined alpha multiplied by a print plus combined and we set this to be a low value, wait that doesn't make any sense, I guess we can use just shade color here and primitive there, it's too bad we can't use prim alpha, primitive please, shade is going to be our orange color, now we have a small shine here and we can move the shine around, now we just need an orange skin texture, orange skin texture, this is kind of nice, nope actually this is not nice at all, use Donald Trump, I don't think he has the same pores you know what I mean, oh this is like a popcorn ceiling, kinda, not quite, this is kind of what it looks like, seamless please, this feels like it would trigger someone's phobia, let's try this one with some editing, your mom is making francescina, I think you'd thyrophobia is what it's called, here's my dance, all right, this one triggered, okay that's good, I care very much about my ruffled viewers, the one phobia will tolerate in this channel, I think I want motion sickness, why am I causing motion sickness somehow, you have heterophobia, what's that, holy bay and ghost ship, okay ghost ship, motion sickness, I think it's so slow that you wouldn't really feel it, but if someone actually complained about it I might even actually change it, oily bolly bay, just close your eyes bro, just just close your eyes and not that deep, where did I export to, is it this one, I think this has potential, what do you think, that's indecently, so we can't forget the asshole part of the orange, that's not when it goes to red, it's like brighter around here, all right, now we have an asshole on our front, you should get motion sickness from playing high fps games, really, this is like the fourth time I'm doing this in two days, but fine I'll do it again, we do what must be done, wait, how do I actually sphere project on this, this is nonsense right, does this make any sense, I think this is a terrible idea, youtube intro music v-lag, it's rude, I'm listening to youtube intros right now, why not an nth map, I think we might have to do an nth map if we want this to look any fine at all, I might have to say no to the reflection idea, too bad, that's not what oranges look like though, right, orange looks a lot tastier than this, honestly, even I would drink tuna shake, a coconut shake though, yeah, that makes sense, I don't know, people are acting like it's a big deal, that makes it a big deal, cork is not an alpha texture at all, it just tastes a lot like spoiled milk. Dude, I can't make a fucking orange, oh well, this is what it's gonna be for now, so I think you should, the other day that makes threesomes of this lucky without increasing by the same shape, we're gonna high up all the objects like this too, yes, and if you look at it, look, we already do this, okay, there is also grapes missing but before I get to the grapes, I kind of want to remove the awfulness of what this is right now, these are strawberries, I will for sure change to strawberries, they look way too low-res in plastic, I don't like characters giving opinions about the real world like that, it always feels a little like the author's self-insert, so I'm gonna fucking size up this up, is there something wrong with it, do you, would you like it smaller, I feel like we can't really make it any smaller without really losing things, but having this be as small as possible without losing anything is honestly like a commendable goal in a way, but every element of this feels like it has to be there, it's just so much game, I mean which game's hub can we compare this to, okay, this game's gonna pump before stream, so let's just look like that all the time, I always look like this, if I had a pump, I would be looking a lot bigger, I mean I did do bench press today, so maybe I have a little bit of a pump still, oh shit, I forgot there was an entire game outside of that, I remember that too, yeah, it does feel like that, yeah, actually it is about the same size as a paper Mario overworld, isn't it, I'm not opposed to pineapple, but right now I'm kind of done making fruit, there's gonna be warps to other areas in the game, but the size at the moment to reach other areas does feel like it would take a while, I mean we can go in game real quick, take a short look at it, see how it feels, so this is the first overworld, reach the first level by just going here, and the second level is like basically right next to it over here, and I guess from here to the third level it does take a little bit, but this is a blocked overworld, right, So you can't make any progress here for a bit until eventually you figure out the way through here at which point you're already at the first bowser entrance and then right around the corner is the next level maybe the straight here is a little long you know this part here we could shorten this honestly yeah we should shorten that that would be a good change maybe we should think more about what we can shorten am i a sucker i am a sucker the forest actually looks decent i just need to make sure the trees are the same type the black fish truly giving bars like the jury do the black kids they're saying the game boys purely for the practice i've heard someday somebody well what is this  this is probably quite a bit better to shorten it like that for my to your danger that's a plan dog my squad is is something like that might be better and then this is a little long hello franklin delano blues don't know this is very big already yeah but most of this is very necessary it's just a few small sections that i think we can shorten sharper than you probably i don't like how long this tunnel is now uh actually it might be fine let me take a look at how this feels now because whenever i'm in this jungle swimming slopes and shit to have you move quickly you want to probably make people feel hella cool true but he had fast travel paths between two sections of the islands so if you're on the external navigation what we're doing well that was the initial plan but then we had a bad idea which is that the pause menu has a map and on the map you can select which level entrance you walk to and you can walk to any level entrance that you've entered before so that would completely get rid of that entire thing um there would be no travel time so i'm actually not worried about travel time at all i'm just worried about um vast empty stretches of land okay now you can just jump over here which of course we do not want so we have to solve that too somehow also how does this part feel that feels a little long hello pappy prinny any ost wishes for today  dk64 let's do that i don't want to listen to shit first gaming don't give six for hd okay didn't think they already released an hd version of this game it's only been like what 25 years so for metal brother alchemist i will get this killed okay no i don't see the point anyway i actually do want to get rid of this whole thing here a little bit which we can actually do now that i think about it okay this song is such a banger so so that would have to work via item babysitting and everyone hates item babysitting so that's a little bit of an issue  item babysitting is like one of the funniest social problems of the 21st century think about it okay you're done thinking i will explain basically it is very easy and tempting for a game creator to put like an item babysitting mission or something similar to that into the game because it's such an easy idea to come up with but it's such an inconvenient design it's it's um it's like taking morphine or something it's like oh this is an easy way to feel good but also it fucking sucks for everyone involved it's the game design morphine okay the dk crew relative ease back what did you miss we were talking about how putting missions where you babysit items is like taking morphine and then frankie come to me to the fridge  yeah this is actually one thing i kind of don't like about games and that is the tendency for players to never use their consumables it's especially like a problem in pokemon i believe it's because gamers when they play pokemon don't realize that the only resource they truly have is their time so they're not willing to use a resource to save time and as soon as you realize that you only recent research playing pokemon is time pokemon kind of sucks you know what i mean so research hello mirabilis i really like the energy of babies to morphine that's not what i meant oh what if we could somehow turn this into a slide or something i think that would be a lot more fun but then how do you get back up hello franklin or good night franklin so don't let me sharks and there will be big babas around the island so okay this sand looks uh semi-passable although i do like the way it goes into blue my fork is gone oh Lilaa i implemented my export label workaround today i will no longer ask for export labels i now have a solution look at this find first matching and just do this and this just iterates the distance until i find what i need the sentiment for the yoshi garden i do not remember that one i could send ever passes a semi you ever seen those videos where mr beast gives away like things and then there's like a gift wrap that clearly looks like a car and people are like you get this if you can guess what it is and then they're like is it a car it's like no it's a huge pile of iphone stacked up to look like a car that's how sand capacity is semi so how aren't you i am not um i don't know why  case discord discord here that is a nice texture but i don't think we can use that here forget how you're doing today all right so your command is my order sir god we're going out to eat today do you guys think they will ask me how i am i don't know how i am what would i respond so is that what social anxiety is like do so so pretty when they ask how you are reply hungry and pat your belly i will do that it sounds so funny dude better i have a question for you this is something i've learned recently apparently there are autistic people that get offended when you say the r word and i thought okay you getting offended actually is kind of offensive because like you're implying autistic people are slow but like they're not right so it's like the fuck am i right with this because there's too much self-confidence or social anxiety true so this is our topic of today ah shit i hope we don't get stunned on this topic well i say i'm not keaton but chat will never accept that so so my name is right second he has very delayed sure but that's not because he's autistic right i don't know if that's because of it but like not every autistic person is like developmentally delayed i guess a lot of them are delayed speech wise right that's one of the symptoms but that doesn't mean the same as like stupid is you're correct you're testing yourself so you also think it's offensive when people when autistic people get offended at the word i guess you're not really allowed to say anything about it because it's like yeah what are you gonna do tell them to not feel the things they feel well sure i mean the way i understand it is like autistic people are more likely to be mentally slower than the average person but they're also very much likely to be mentally way faster than the average person right so it's it's the same spectrum it's just there's more in the extremes so that was my understanding of it because i'm talking about autistic because that's the topic of today i guess because i know a lot of autistic people and some of them are like way smarter than the average person you would meet and it's at a rate where it's like that seems correlated You mean again, we rarely talk about this. Rewriting the Mario 64 engine is neuro-typical. I would never claim to be neuro-typical. Sometimes it makes you think words are minty. You know exactly what I mean. He gets it. Some words are minty. I mean, I get that it's not nice to be called the R-word. I'm just saying it doesn't seem targeted at autistic people. It seems targeted at anyone that is perceived as being stupid. The R-word, I don't know if I can say it. I'm at a point where when people tell me a word is offensive, I just stop saying it because I don't get it and I will never get it. What the fuck are these trampolines? And 2-1, fair enough. Hello, Mr. OST. Please not this again. What the fuck is this? Shit. Yes, there was a French cat I saw. I almost wanted to send it to Biobak, but I missed it. Shit. It was such a funny cat. The cat went, buongiorno. Wait, that's Italian. Never mind. Good thing I didn't send it to him. Okay. Even though they're trying to actively hurt you using the fact you're autistic, I think it's still offensive. Really? You think they say that knowing you're autistic? I thought they just say it. And then the person that it was sent to just so happens to be autistic most of the time. Okay. But yeah, any insult that pokes at an apparent quality of you that you cannot control obviously is extremely uninspirited. And to be clear, being stupid is also something we cannot inherently control. There's like a fucked up thing where it's like... Like, let's say this is your intelligence, and like, if you're here, it's like you're an idiot and it's okay to insult you, but then if you're just over the hurdle of disability, it is completely fucked up to insult you. And that's weird to me. Shouldn't it just always be not okay to insult someone? Are you guys with me? Am I cooking? Just because you're slightly too smart to like count as disabled, it's okay to insult you? I don't know about that. Definitely cooking. I'm glad. Bullying people is bad, such a cult thing. Okay. Okay, but that's not what I said.  I don't know if I would call Mario 64 complex, but sure. Actually, I guess it is complex compared to like fucking Pong. So does it mean unless the person needs to hear it, then it's firm? Sure, but that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying the acceptability of your insult should not depend on whether that person is just over the hurdle of disability or not. Okay. You would fire someone for being German? Okay. Oh, did a message get filtered and I didn't see it? So the last message was something about German and then you said you would fire the guy. What's wrong with being German? I'm German. It's me. What's wrong with me? No. Okay. My grandmama was like six when the war ended. I do not think he fought in the war. Why? Would I be a bad person if he did? Okay. The top line division of the SS. Okay. It's the infamous toddler division. I won't lie. This song is me when I'm begging for a banana. Okay. Okay. I can even handle this Berentrott music. I don't know if you hate this music or if Berentrott is something I said to the Banjo-Kazooie music. Because Berentrott is exactly why I don't like the Banjo-Kazooie music. Okay. But it's okay. Listening to it on stream is fine. While I'm doing work. It's fitting. Oh, that's kind of a nice color. I actually kind of like this. Oh, that's a nice fucking color. Holy shit. We got to remember this color. Okay. That looks nice. He's just discovered yellow. Okay. You better bring the yellow over when you come visit.  I almost want to add a vertex just so I can add the splotch of yellow here. Yeah, that's nicer. It will look better in the end, don't worry. Will you be giving this area fancy water graphics too? Yes. We already have the codes. Okay. Okay, so up until here it's probably going to be normal rock. And then it's going to turn into volcano rock. Come to think of it, this shouldn't be volcanic rock, right? This side here. Only the other side, maybe. Shit. Should we maybe just take this part? What if we just started turning this part here into this rock? Outside wall is not volcano. Okay. What's going on with the giant fruits? They grow on the super happy tree and then they put them here. You can eat green and yellow bananas, this is true. Guys, how brown does a banana have to go before you stop eating it? Give it to me straight. Okay. Give me your favorite banana RPG. RGB. Banana against banana bread. How are you going to handle the original music from this game? Presumably you can't compose original music yourself. Badub is making this. He was in chat just a second ago. I like how you call it the ripening process instead of the rotting process. Because that's what it is to me. Oh, banana. Can you tolerate? Guessing my banana RGB at which I will stop eating it. It's probably around... 7F5018. Let's see what that looks like. What did I say? 7F5018. That's a pretty brown banana. Isn't that orange? That's a banana color. It is not ripped from DK64, I think. I think it's from Monkey Ball. Ah yes, those wine grapes are rotting beautifully. Okay, fine. Just so you stop begging, I will make the banana more green. Fuck you. Okay. Man, Uni-V is so useful. Look at this. Fucked up your Vmap. And Uni-V. Go here. Straight, perfect Vmap. Beautiful. So you would eat a banana that is entirely RGB. 8F5020. Honestly, that's a tough question. Honestly, I kinda guessed wrong. Because my true banana preference is quite a bit more yellow than that. For over $20? Fine. For $20, I will eat the 805020 banana. What does shade color do on this one again? It gives it a lot more detail. Eww that looks awful. You would eat fully browned banana for 10 minutes on your salary? That's not 10 minutes of my salary. Besides that's not 100% like Giga Brown. That's like still decently yellow. Programmers and animators are on their own but can be okay when editing things? Uh-huh. Better than incorporating a day and night system into your notes? Yes. I do very very much enjoy the night systems but that's something you need to plan the game around. And we did not. So we're not adding that. Man who made this banana so yellow? Kinda hate it. Okay actually you know what we can visualize the last banana we would eat. This banana here? Very edible. This one? That's not a real banana color. This one? This one's getting bad. That's a nice banana. You first started a blender? What did you do with it? My first boot up of blender? I was just fucking around with it and learned how to UV map stuff with it so I could make my BromX in 2016 better. That is not the optimal use case for blender though. Rotting is a word for sure. Do you know how many times I've heard Lilaa say that she's girl rotting? Has to be a verb. You're gonna ripen the game throughout the playthrough with a noise detector and a good combiner? Yeah, I mean I've said this earlier right that it would be very funny if that happened? It does seem a little nonsensical but I mean, do we care? I'm a little worried though that people will expect that to do something. We're using blender once, I made a low poly hammer model, I used low resolution textures. Interesting. Okay this does not work at all. This is going to be so much easier to UV map. I think this mod sucks. The mod sucks because it's hard to work with. Watching a tutorial for blender is the wrong move in my opinion. All blender tutorials are pretty awful. The best way to learn blender is to just start doing things in it, if you ask me. It's not about being overwhelmed, all the tutorials are just insanely slow and they're just teaching you to do one specific thing. You don't actually really learn how to use your button combos very well in my opinion. Okay think about this, the way blender works is it's a toolkit and you use this toolkit to do things. So you can combine things, similar to like how in Mario you can jump and then you can kick and now you've combined the jump and the kick into a jump that goes further or a jump that damages enemies. Now if you watch a blender tutorial that's like watching a tutorial on collecting the chain jump star. It's like now you can collect the chain jump star but maybe you didn't understand why you were doing the jumps to get to the location. I mean you would hopefully understand it on the way but it's also like a very inefficient way of doing it, right? Because now they're going to tell you to do each jump over and over when you could have just looked at the jumps Mario can do and learned the jumps individually. And you'd be like wow okay I have all these jumps and I can draw conclusions out of the knowledge I was given and determine what the correct jumps to do are based off of that. And that's why I say just read the blender documentation. I'm not going to put a lakeland in giant at all. This phenomenon needs to be studied where people ask a question as though their question was not a suggestion for you to put the thing in the game. It's always kind of funny to me. I don't know. If you were to develop on any other console which one would it be? Honestly a very difficult question. I mean I can just learn to develop on another console but let's say the N64 was gone and I had to pick a new console. I would probably pick like the Switch 2 because I could actually make commercial games with that that realistically someone would buy. Which I'm advancing right now. Currently I train with 263 pounds. I don't know. So people are wondering because the nets and body reference aren't moving at this point in time I told them you said another video will implement it. Yes I will definitely implement it. It is on my to-do list. This is correct information. It is very easy to implement. It's going to take me like half an hour. I wish there was an easy way to implement it so that ropes also kind of move around when you jump on them. Because ropes in Mario 64 look so goddamn static and it's kind of awful. Maybe I should just one day take the time to make them move around when you jump on them so they don't feel like a rigid steel pole. Actually even a fucking steel pole would move more than the ropes in Mario 64. But I'm a bit worried that it's going to feel jank to play with. Trade-offs, trade-offs. Oh there's definitely N64 games with rope physics but I'm like Conker System. Actually we have them. We have rope physics already. I just haven't applied them to any poles. You think I should? So no fun tricking you. It works. Come to think of it, I need to charge it. It looks a bit busted. What do you mean? Hey Monster Tracker Video, you didn't mention how good the music was for the game. Was it included in the MVP category? It is part of MVP. Well, okay, the Tracker Video doesn't include everything. Stuff like engine rewrites and things like that are not part of it. The Tracker is really more like the public placata. It's not a document I use to keep track of production. For that reason, it only covers broad strokes. My microphone is playing up because the fucking heater went off. Okay, this white looks awesome. No, I can't compose. You can import it like any other Blender plugin.  Who does the composition? Is it Pi or Di? No, it's Badub. Badub is doing the composing and Zerovolt is doing the importing. And right now, Sauron is actually doing a cool thing for the Mario 64 Retro section. I don't know if you remember that video I made about the Mario 64 Retro section. But Sauron had some cool ideas for it that we are hopefully going to see in action. How are these completely fucking disconnected? What? Huh? Wow, that's a thing that can happen? How did that happen? Hello, Mushy. Yes, these are very good buttons. Mushy, oh my god, you should have seen this earlier when I used this button. You have no idea how convenient these buttons are. If you would have jumped, it would have been like, how? This is magic. This is a very cool plugin that Bioware found. Me when I'm in a comp competition and I really want to get picked. Do you pick VS Code over any other coding software? It works. I don't care about anything else. What more do I need? I just need to look for my folders. It looks for my folders. All good. What more do you want the coding software to do for you? I guess that's my question. Okay. I'm not a dingleberry. We obviously still need the transitions here to be clean, but this is looking like a good start. Doesn't VS Code have IntelliSense? I thought it did. IntelliSense is, you click on a thing and it takes you there. There we go. Oh, you're saying that this one doesn't need stuff, and it already does have that. I don't remember installing an extension for that. No, texture filtering does not affect performance. There is a special hardware part that does nothing but filter textures, so all you're doing is making the hardware part not work. I do have a video I'm working on though, where I talk about why N64 games are so blurry, and I do disable a bunch of things that make the game blurry that do impact performance in that video. So if you're interested in that, hold on to your horse, I guess. That looks pretty nice, I think. There is a really cool technique for N64 on how you can literally half the fill required without really affecting the visuals too much, and this is applicable to any N64 game. So you can get 480i games running near 30fps, at least you can get Mario 64 480i running at 30fps. I have wanted to make that part of that video, but I haven't managed to get it to work. SpookyElua invented this. But I was just curious if you can use a texture filtering antialiasing and an extra horizontal blur filter? Yeah, there's like a VI, the deliberate filter that is applied. Ita, did someone ask that question like not even a minute before you just did? Go into the corner of shame. Pandering to armpit fetishes, you guys better not get off to me. I'm just a stinky man. Is the resolution 720p60, but the pixelation and CRT processor don't affect the performance? Sure. Is 480i that much better visually? It gives you a lot sharper of an image, but obviously now you're in interlaced mode. I don't know, maybe I have a video here. Let me find this video. This is off an N64. No, this is off emulator. Yeah, this is what it looks like on the N64 in 480i mode. I mean, it's a lot less pixelated, right? Because it's 480i. Well, it also has a bunch of other effects removed, but obviously it's a low frame rate and there's a lot of pixel instability because it disabled antialiasing. As long as I keep my feet off camera.  The page length renders wrong because it's a higher resolution output image. And I didn't fix anything. Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's the wrong one. Holy shit, I almost ruined everything. This is what I wanted. So Mushy, I recently was talking to AP when he was streaming. And he said he liked Madness, and I was thinking, maybe I should make a Madness remake, you know what I mean? It would just be the Bing Bing Wahoo game. Just like, okay, Madness has some interesting ideas, but they're all completely terribly executed. Why not turn it into a real game? Real Mario 64 Madness has never been attempted. I would absolutely not go with the brooded ass visuals that you've been using though. What is the Bing Bing Wahoo again? It's when Mario does platforming, he goes Bing Bing Wahoo. And no, I do not have time. I wish I did though. And, you know, the idea would be to shit this out the same way I shat out the first Mario 64 Madness. Where it's like, oh, I have two weeks to make the whole game. Okay. Well, of course I would still have to sacrifice some stuff. So I'm saying, real Mario 64 Madness has never been attempted. Ah, fuck, you're right, that was a Kakariko Village level. Oh, how could I forget? Yeah, I would not be looking forward to making that one. Okay. Unless we want a less awful hack, it would be a lot less awful.  Well, that's not what's going on. I don't know if you're familiar with Mario 64 Madness. It is a completely awful game. But some people like it for some reason. Yes, R.T.Y. can exist on a real cartridge. Okay, I mean, gravity flat out, I don't know if you'll settle for the two areas trick nowadays. No, it would still be two areas. If it's in two weeks, I have to make some sacrifices. Some heavy sacrifices. I'm no longer the guy who made Micron 64. True. Okay.  So in the fruit platforming stuff, Fruity Tooty something. It wouldn't have a name, because it's an oval star, most likely. I don't know, CEO. Yes, for sure, Keaton. We can name our world stars, actually. I mean, if we want a hint system in the end, we definitely need to name them somehow. It comes to think of it, when you collect a star, it shows the whole thing anyway. So maybe we do need to name them. Because it'd be weird to have that be missing outside of levels. Anyway, because we're going out to eat today, I think I have to keep the stream today short. And already leave you guys. I'm very happy with this area's look, though, so far. Definitely has progressed a lot. I especially like the new trees here we put. They're gonna look so good in the end, I hope. And it looks much better being so short. Also like that this is now a different type of corridor, compared to all the other corridors we have. All the other ones are like S-shaped, and this one's just a 90° angle. It's much better. Anyway, I'll see you guys next stream, which might be on Tuesday, and if not, likely on Saturday. So until then, bye bye!
