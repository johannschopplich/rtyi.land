Hello? Hello? Hello Selden? Hello Zeyna? My stream manager is down for some reason. I just started. It's gonna take a few seconds until the YouTube stream starts. I got the recommendation but it didn't work. What the hell? It should be live now. What kind of cool optimization did you do this week? I removed two pointers from every graph node. There are no more pointers in graph render. It might sound crazy but it works. Or it might sound like nothing at all but don't worry. It's cool. It was so hard to do. I worked on it for almost four days. But it does save a good bit of RAM and performance too. 1700%? That's a little much. I don't think it's 1700%. I think it's in the ballpark between 100 and 800% depending on use case. We gotta work on the spool here. Which is an amazing game like this and maybe they would not need to turn on DLSS for everything. True. Dude, I can imagine Hail to Dalaran will make DLSS work on the N64 at some point. It would be so cool. Have you considered making a course teaching N64 game design basics? Nope. 10x12? Well, imagine upscaling half the RDP resolution over a quarter. Like 160x120. Upscaling that to 240p. That would actually be insane if that could work. Or imagine even upscaling it to 360p. But I have no idea if you can make that in a performant way. Especially because on N64 it's all horizontal. It's not squares. Yeah, I'm sure that makes sense to you. We'll just keep it at that. It's all horizontal. It's not squares. Same, Maldi. I would love to see it. But this is definitely something that needs to be implemented in the RCP with that kind of thing. I have no idea how the technical game design is supposed to work. Geh, sind die 29 true? I haven't had time yet. Well, I should implement them soon. 3.1? I have no idea what that means. Any OST wishes for the day? Jurassic Jungle? That's not a whole OST. Oh wait, you're making fun of the YouTube comment. I've seen that. We had like a comment chain of like a hundred of them all saying Jurassic Jungle. It's crazy. Back to silence, don't get it much true. I like silence too. Fun fact, for the longest time I used to just not listen to any music at all. Oh, that thing has to hop and flag. Interesting. Okay, so the optimization I did. Whenever you work in a 3D rendered game, you most likely need to traverse a graph. One graph node is going to be like the Mario actor, and then the other node is like his body, and then his head, and then his shoulder. Because they're all attached to each other, which usually is a lot of pointer reading and writing, which fucking sucks. Because when you have pointers in your code, that really slows stuff down, and they don't really do anything. They're just metadata. They don't actually render anything. So what I did over this week, I made the thing that instead of doing graph traversal, it compiles a geolayout into a bytecode, and then something else reads out this bytecode to process render comments based off of that. That means it works entirely without pointers, and it is one-to-one identical visual output. The best part is we don't even need to change the API, because it just compiles down from the Mario API into a bytecode. So this is going to save a decent chunk of memory, and it's going to save a decent chunk of data throughput. That does, however, mean very slightly longer loading times, but I think technically we don't need that, because we could just store pre-compiled geolayouts in the game. That is a good point, Biobank. I'm going to change the types, so don't ask me about the commodity optimization I did this week. Pointers in C make your brain twist. Let me digest the statement. Let's consider the facts of the situation. One, pointers are complicated for you. Two, you are familiar enough with programming to know what a pointer is. These two statements cannot coexist. That's like saying, it is raining, and I don't believe it is raining. You know what I mean? It's like a seemingly paradox, even though those are two statements that can coexist. Anyway, we want to do this without setting the Mario action. Let's see if that works. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, not what we want. Fes? What is Fes? We can do Fes. Hmm. We can unlock Mario in the cutscene somehow. How do you... all this stuff you see... Is there anything like that? I guess there is, um... Hmm. Where's the bully? Does the bully cutscene play when you are in midair? There's the red coin star cutscene. Hmm. Yeah, this one works out, and then we can branch off of that. The way the sentence is in C confuses me. Ah, well, in C it's very simple. The AND symbol means make a pointer to thing, and the star symbol means read pointer. In C++ it's stupid, because references break pointer arithmetic logic completely. Hmm. Oh, we need these. Of course, time stop. Hmm. Aha, that's how you do it. Did your music go for a full mouth throughput? Not yet. Still working on it. Amazing music in the game, you made the music as well? No, the music is all made by Badoob. Dude, Badoob sent me a remix today of All Alone Bubble Dome. Or was it yesterday? I don't know. Hmm. Yeah, references in C++ are really dumb. Hate them. Okay, I think we have the cutscene logic done. We just need to make a good cutscene now. Hmm. No, he just made the remix. I don't know what this is for, he just sent it to me. I don't know if there's a point to this existing, or if he just wanted this to exist. Hmm. Hello, Beta. Ah, yeah, I have no idea what this is for. That was my first question to him. Oh, that was Sonic, not Beta, sorry. I just realized. Hmm. Dang, that sucks. So what co-op do I need to get after this weekend? Don't ask! I'm probably gonna make a video about it this week. It is cool as fuck. Hmm. I think I might be the first to implement the algorithm that I've made. Hmm. Is everyone hoping I'll use it? I don't know. I mean, obviously the voices make it bizarre for a game. But maybe? Or maybe not? Maybe? I don't know. There's a lot of voices that are very cool. I kinda like them. Just very not video game-like. But they fit the song extremely well. Hmm. Hmm. Save Hytale, stop killing games, what are you talking about? Dude, stop killing games is so funny. The fact that the only reason it passes is that Yamato's death, the fucking most cringe streamer that exists on this entire platform, pissed off this other cringe streamer so much that people started hating the other cringe streamer. It's fucking poetry, it's all coming together. Metal of Myth? No, they are both ega-cringe. What is stop killing games? I actually don't 100% know. It is something about they wanted to prevent publishers or game development companies from being able to revoke your access to games. So for example, let's say you make a game, let's say you make Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2010. And your game functions as a single player game, but for some reason they always check the servers. And then they make it so that the servers are not online, you can't play the game. They want that to not happen, I think. I think that's the gist of it. They want games to have an end-of-life plan, I think, maybe. I don't know, man. Consider this presented by the official law request firm. Oh, I see. What's wrong with camera.c? If you don't like camera.c, that means you haven't modified it enough. I modified it so much that at this point there is not that much R64 code left in it. Like I removed all the camera modes. But this might need another optimization pass. Even if the game is always online, they need to have an end-of-life plan. That could include open-source to server-side or update to patch. That's the requirements. Can the end-of-life plan be just take the game offline? What do you think, Mace? Well, maybe it can include that if you put it on the box of the game or something, you know. Because I feel like if the game developer is like, yeah, we're gonna support this until there's less than 100 people. And then we're just gonna fucking take it offline. I think that should be fine. There's still some R64 code left. I don't like the ambiguous use of O here. I don't know. No, play limit is kind of vague and also not verifiable. Well, I mean, 10 would be very easily verifiable, right? What about Mario? Actually, Mario Maker 1 is still playable, right? I guess. I guess that doesn't count. There should be an option for me. Well, it wouldn't be an option. It would be them forced, right? I don't actually know what the initiator says. I mean, obviously, I as a player would like it if they were just forced to release the source code instead of taking the servers down. I don't really see a disadvantage for humanity to that. In fact, yeah, as soon as anything's not commercial anymore, it being open source sounds like a great thing. Yeah, that sounds pretty neat. Well, if I were in a position of power, I would simply do the right thing. I would simply be a good person, you know? I think a cutscene makes this better, but I'm not sure. Thank you, Wimps. Do companies sign anything and basically whatever they want to you, unlike in the EU? Yeah. Probably Sayonara, but I can't imagine they're very huge. I mean, if you count the Chinese revision of the N64, then, I mean, there's a huge one. Ooh, what do you think? I think that looked nice. Yeah, it runs on Aequa. There was one guy that really cared about Aequa and he made it run on that. Hello, Rick Luton. Dude, do you think I could become famous by completely siding with pirate software and starting to talk to people about how his code is actually good? Dude, I could, like, become friends with him and, like, make it big in Blizzard. Become a big streamer. This will be the grift. Not a fan of the fact that you need to wall jump to get up, but I like the animation. Okay, well, you're not supposed to get pushed off like that. In the end, we'll just have, like, a collision here that accommodates for that, so you don't have to wall jump at all. Dude, it has been so juicy for drama this week. The fucking H3 lawsuits, the pirate software situation is crazy, Ludwig, Mango getting drunk. Bro, YouTube drama is going crazy. Also, fun fact, I did that this week. Look at this. Begin loop, zero hits. It is no more used. Isn't that fucking sick? We got rid of the stupid comment. IMF my case critical video, remember? Analog B3, this situation is crazy. Because I only know about one of those dramas? What? Well, okay, the Mango Ludwig thing, that's, like, because he's so melee adjacent, I know about it, and I used to be a melee player. Anyway. Let's see what else we got to program here. So, wait, does the spool have a safe flag? It does not. Okay, the spool needs to just, let's just make the spool despawn when the safe flag is set. Okay, if I did this right, then when we push the spool now. Wait, I need to mail to make the pole not work, whoops. Just the pole. This is what we'll do. Now the pole should not work at first, and then we can... The pole is not here as intended. We push this off. And now the pole works. Okay, the pole is here. Now we save the game. Okay, apparently resetting doesn't work for maybe the Avenger spot. Okay. Um. Hmm. Doesn't seem to quite work right now. The spool is gone, and the pole is here, but... This is not here. Make random blue and red balls that appear with a flag, you get 100 years worth of free theory videos. That's a little crazy, is it not? Actually, Demo is at someone else. He might have played it. Hmm. Why would this not be working? Yeah, yeah, if you do the Poochie mission in Course 2, Poochie comes and joins you in the overworld. I just realized I need to make the spool pushable, not just be standing on it. And the spool needs to rotate, too. I'm just setting it to 96, not making it visible. What the fuck? 251. Is that crazy? Is it executing this for one frame? Like, is this gonna work? It does, okay. This is very important to know. I didn't realize this before, but this is a bug in my engine that I need to fix right now. The bug has been fixed. Alright, now as intended, the spool is unrolled and the spool is gone. It all works as we want. Hello, Logique the Pixel. What the fuck was that grab on? Alright, I still need to make the spool pushable. And I need to make the spool roll. No! TLDR, we killed pointers. No more linked lists. With that, we compiled GeoLayouts into a list of graph commands. And it's cool. It saves you a lot of data cache throughput. Almost like a 200 microsecond improvement. Considering the render time before was around 4 milliseconds, 200 microseconds is kind of a shit ton. It's like 5%. And we also need this to happen in the opposite direction if Mario is pushing into the ceiling. Is this how you do it? Nope, no field obj, of course. Field obj, it is field obj. Why would that be a flag? What the fuck? Alright, let's see if we can push the spool. I am slightly worried that it's going to roll us over. Not at all what I wanted to do. It's a spool, not a spoosh. True. I think to watch Casey Miner showcase his brain blasts, he's like, Jimmy, you don't get that thing. No, that's not how I do it. I think the real brain blasts you get if you spend like an hour on a really difficult problem, and then you just take a step back and you like, dig a hole in your garden or something. You know what, this is a stupid thing to check for. This is not at all what we should be checking for. Aren't there different types of- yeah, this is not act walking, right? Maybe this. Alright, let's see which one of these three values that I expect to be matching does not match. Beyond the dog grinds, huh? Okay, but, think about like, there's work in my garden I need to do. Might as well do that, you know? This is not a ceiling? Well, what do you want to do in the collision map, really? Like, how are you thinking the collision map should look? I don't see much I can change here. I mean, it seems it doesn't look awkward pushing it. Then it looks awkward standing on it. I think pushing like that would be fine. I just need to fix a few things. Oops. This constant does not actually do anything. But it is kind of nice. Then I have to make it collision-cubish anyway. Yeah, but not quite a cube. The problem is even with a cube it would rotate and it would look really weird because the cube would get squished below it, I think. How am I not pushing anything here? What? How's that possible? That shouldn't be possible. You know what, maybe this is fine if we just cheat a little bit. Let's just cheat a little bit. It will be fine. No, it's not fine. I need to normalize these. I need to normalize these. I was thinking he would be under the ceiling, but clearly that is not going to happen. We want the angle to be going inside, which means we need to occlude a couple degrees here. I'm not sure how many degrees exactly, but it doesn't actually matter that much. That should be fine. That should be fine. Because how are you going to push it without being up there? We're listening to the fast OST right now, so I already mentioned all of them are fast OSTs. Okay. Pew! Okay, I might have overdone it a little bit. Maybe we went a little crazy. Um, this is weird. Oh. That would do it. Row of Intellisense. I had it at some point, but it stopped working, so now I have to work without Intellisense. Interesting. What force values are we getting? Is there a fart sound in your room, Max? Is there a brain in your head? Sorry, that was me. The answer is no. One, two, zero? Zero? Four? Twenty-two? Where are these numbers coming from? How? Did I twist Z and X? I don't think so. Because if they died otherwise, there's going to be the last thing we shouldn't ask about. I mean, I would like to have Intellisense work, but it seems to randomly break and then unbreak, so it's like... Even if I go and fix it now, I'm just going to have to fix it again next week, so what's the point? And even if I don't fix it again right now, it's going to fix itself next week, so... It is what it is, man. Oh. I have my records wrong. How's that 25? Oh, I see. Yeah, so we probably need something more closer to 0.5. And then also what I want is that if we're doing this, we want to move Mario with the spool. And I think now we'll get something relatively clean looking. Oh, that's not programming that randomly breaks or unbreaks, it's the programming tool. Wow, that looked like dog shit. Why is he sometimes climbing up there? That is fucked up. That is actually awful. Okay, we need to make a glitch move against that. I know why that's happening. I don't like it at all. Fuck it, we'll make it round. We need to make it round anyway. Cope. Now, why is Mario not moving with the thing? That is an issue. It should be. What if you always move Mario with the thing? Why is that not great? Might be an object order thing. Sperm. So the moveMario thing does not work. Which sucks, because I wanted to move Mario according to how much the spool rotates. But it seems even that doesn't fully magnetize him to the thing. So I can't make that work. I think we just have to accept that it's gonna look a little weird. Yeah, I'm gonna record a case clips video. There's actually two cool optimizations I did this week. This is so bizarre. This is so weird looking. It looks so ass. Why? What's going on there? Why is he doing the pushing animation? He's doing it for exactly one frame. And then sometimes he walks on top of the spool too. Then for some reason the spool can do that. It's moving the wrong direction. Hello Keenars. Yes, I am fairly jacked. Yeah. I guess we can do that. Fine. And fast seems to be popular. People keep coming in here being like, oh my god, it's fast! Oh my god! Compromise on this. Oh my god. Well, I guess that means we don't need this anymore. Cool. This old thing. Fuck it, I guess. Cool. This might just work already. And we still need to move power with the collision. Obviously that wouldn't work anymore. I haven't said that in many uploads, I get the same alarm as my sleep one. This one's always the reason I wake up every day thinking about the uploading convention. True. Okay, I think now we can move Mario. Okay. What? Oh. Whoops. Accidentally added the position instead of the velocity. Okay, perfect. It works. All right. Then we need to copy this to the OOBJ pointer instead. And of course we want less force, because that was way too much. Hey! Now there's one bug I saw earlier where you can move in the wrong direction. What is this shit? What the fuck is that? Huh? Huh? It looks like accumulated distance and forward velocity kind of don't go the same way. That must be because someone is not doing the right thing. Yes. I am inverting the... oh, of course. Nice. Hey, it all works! Are there flexible ropes in your engine? No. Yeah, maybe I was being stubborn on the collision there. It's a lot easier when you work with simple collision shapes. Let's have this rope around this pool. Yes! Do you want me to do that? Oh, there's also the rope around this here. I was thinking I'd just leave that to you, because I feel like this would be a lot of work and you're going to redo it anyway. The rope around this pool needs to be animated. Fair enough. Right, right, we wanted to scale bone. Or what were you thinking? How were we thinking this? No idea. Oh. Well, I was hoping it would just look fine. Let's just test it. Let's see what we can get. It would look awesome, but what's the plan? I'll just say it would look awesome, and then they'll tell me what would look awesome. I mean, you can, but you cannot be a dick. I think an alpha green on the rope, like the other one, but with many offset lines instead of one, so it looks like the rope is being unraveled. Oh shit, okay, I see. Honestly, I think I would have the easiest time just making a 3D model around it. I think that would also just look better than trying to scale it. Or, well, actually having it be smaller scale at the end is gonna look awesome. Let me think about how this should look. What if, instead of all this shit, we just kind of have like... I don't know. Something like this. And then we have the rope cut around it. I don't know. I have no doubt. It should not be doing that. Okay. Scaling it until the last moment, then unraveling the three threads one by one. Three threads. Not sure if we had the same idea. Let's see how three threads fit into this. What's my combiner here? I kind of need to make sure they use the same combiner. Damn, okay. This is doable. I have to do something like that. Whenever something moves, I think flat shading just looks really bad on it. Oh, I see. Oh, I had a different idea. God, my blender is so slow right now. Sorry. Okay. Gent, what's the color of the race you did this week? Optimization situation is crazy. Okay. I'm thinking we're going to have something like this, and then it's going to unravel, and it's going to look like this in the end. Kind of. New, or maybe like this. This is the best OST. Okay. We'll come up with some rope on it. Okay, fine, it has to look like this in the end. Fair point, you convinced me. I hope you're proud of yourself. Oh, no. Okay, now let's make this work. We need an armature. I'm cooking, let's fucking go. Okay. What's the subdivide button? What the fuck, it's fucking right-click. What? Okay. Do you have any tips for making low-poly character models? I want to make a Mario 3 model while making LucasArcade as well. No, actually. Just go for it. Genuinely, I have nothing to say. Okay. I don't think you can ever scale one of the dispeller's joints. You can, cool. The survival of low-poly character modeling is good luck. Hmm. Where's the rest? Oh, never mind. I got upset for no reason. I made myself upset. Okay. That was weird. Can I always take a look at games' videos about small optimizations? True. Actually, yes, that is the tip I should have given you. Look at the Twitter. There's lots of stuff me and Biobank did for optimizations. Hmm. Function. Hmm. Hmm. Okay, bro. Let's see. See? GeoLayout looks perfect. Now what we're gonna do is... ...we're gonna do a little bit of trolling. Don't worry about this part. This is required because of my new system. Don't bully me. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. This should do it. If I did everything right and made no mistake at all, this will work. Note undeclared. Oops. Alt object is not a function What are you talking about? Node link? Storage size of node link isn't known. Right, because you need to include the Z-buffer for that. Oops. Z-buffer... As soon as we get the compiler to compile, we're fine. Z-buffer.h actually. Oh my god. Let's see. It might just work perfectly. Yes, I'm storing stuff in the Z-buffer, leave me alone. I have 8 megabytes of memory, okay? I am allowed to do that. A few things went wrong. First thing is, this fucking collision moved again. How? Why did this fucking collision move again? We had this issue before, we fixed it before. How does it keep happening? There has to be something cursed going on on lambda here, right? It moved again! You saw that? As soon as I hit export, it moves the collision. Why? That's a bug? That's annoying. Anyway... Let's see this again. What if you use a cube? What if you use a cube? What if I kill you with a cube? What if the world was made out of pudding? Okay, something's really fucked up with the spool alpha here. Which makes sense, because we just made a lot of changes to it. Hello, Eevee Point Master. Why is it 0? Concerning. Now it's 255. Now it's 96, as intended. Okay, some bizarre stuff going on here. We missed the 256. Basically, the reason we did that is to get increased precision on the scale mode. It looks good, or well... It works, conceptually. But it kinda disappears so fast that it looks poorly, right? What do you think? I don't like how upset it is. I don't like how upset it is. I don't like how upset it is. That's better. The animation's too fast. The animation's too fast. The animation's too fast. Like, which part are we talking about? Like, which part are we talking about? Is it just falling too fast? I guess we can make this a low-gravity object. Let's see what happens. And I guess we can reduce Mario's force impact on this. Let's see if that looks any better. Like, the robot's doing its fault? You know what, that's a very good argument. We're gonna go with that. If this looks better, we'll just pretend that's the case. That's better. That's better. That felt just a little too long. I think now I've got something nice. Oh, I love that. I think that's great. Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't tell me. I found a skip. I don't like that you can skip that. I'm sorry, speedrunners. I'm removing the skip. Fix the skip. I'm not removing the skip. Yeah, true. There's probably gonna be so many different skips. At least let's not give him any obvious ones that most of us can find. Nice case. Hey, what if you locked a star within the Fresnel lens of the lighthouse? It would be a light source basically, taunting you until you could unlock it. Well, you kind of need to use the lighthouse to open the gate to course 5. So if you were to remove the light from it, it kind of wouldn't make sense that you could go to course 5 anymore. Alright, rope is done. Next, the sand swamp. Oh, that's gonna be fucking fun. So, the sand swamp. Where did I leave my notes for the sand swamp? Hmm. Bro, what did I not write on the sand swamp idea? I have to have written it down somewhere. Ah, yes. There he says, Thomas is stuck in the sand on the lonely island. He doesn't talk much, but when you talk to him, he just refuses to admit that he's stuck in the sand. After 3 stars, he has been turned into a sand castle. Someone turned me into a sand castle. I can't show my face in the Thumbs designer like that. You must help me. Keep the sand castle tiles off him, and he will gift you a star and promise not to crush you. So you get more stars across the game. Centuries later, Mario becomes more positive and he starts cheering for you. In 150 stars or so, he gets married. Someone built me a wife. She's pretty. His wife is just a sand bucket with eyes painted on it. Okay, this is peak. Now, the question is... How do we handle this after the intro sequence? Because if the first thing you do after the intro sequence is talk to the sand farm, that's gonna suck. I don't want that. I don't want that. Maybe he appears at like 3 stars, or 2 stars, or 1 star? But then it's not really... It doesn't work that well. It doesn't work that well. He appears later. He appears later. He appears later. But we want events happening in the overworld immediately is the thing. Well, actually, I guess Poochie and Deathwomp King kind of give you that. Well, actually, I guess Poochie and Deathwomp King kind of give you that. So it's actually fine if he appears at like 10 or 15 stars. So it's actually fine if he appears at like 10 or 15 stars. What are we thinking for the star count then? 15 stars? Let's hang out with Poochie while we think. Let's hang out with Poochie while we think. Buy me some coins, Mr. Pooch. Hello, Skyloft. I am also in Italy. See? It's full of Italians here. Poochie's here from the start. Now Poochie appears after you finish the mission where Poochie escorts you into Hurstul. Now Poochie appears after you finish the mission where Poochie escorts you into Hurstul. Well, let's think about it. Poochie is probably going to appear... Well, first of all, the Goomba King is probably going to appear after 3 stars or so. Because you're going to get the Goomba King mission pretty soon, maybe 4. Definitely on your third trip to the overworld. So you're probably going to see him fishing around here somewhere. So you're probably going to see him fishing around here somewhere. Poochie is going to appear maybe around 8 or 9 stars. Poochie is going to appear maybe around 8 or 9 stars. Let's go to the second part of the first overworld. Well, we don't really have overworld parts anymore, like R64 does. Well, we don't really have overworld parts anymore, like R64 does. That's 18 stars. Actually, it would be very fun if you went exploring and when you came back, the first overworld had changed. Actually, it would be very fun if you went exploring and when you came back, the first overworld had changed. So something like 12 stars seems very good to me. So something like 12 stars seems very good to me. I'm thinking 12 stars for the Sand Womp. Let's do 12. Let's do 12. But then he needs to be turned into a Sand Castle way later... But then he needs to be turned into a Sand Castle way later... Like, 15 stars. Like, 15 stars. First star... After... 65 stars... After... 100 stars... And after... 120 stars. All that means is we have 4 different textboxes for him. All that means is we have 4 different textboxes for him. That should be fine. A lame optimization I did last week. A lame optimization I did last week. A lame optimization I did last week. Deleted an unused function. A lame optimization I did last week. Deleted an unused function. And I don't have water here. I'll be right back to get some water. I'll be right back to get some water. Everything hurts. Everything hurts. Everything easily and fast just makes the game boring for the other players who have to work hard to get rewards. Challing two levels, in my honest, personal opinion anyway. Challing two levels, in my honest, personal opinion anyway. Challing two levels, in my honest, personal opinion anyway. Challing two levels, in my honest, personal opinion anyway. When does it mean to work hard and- Ahem. Huh? Hello, GameBenny. How about the design for this guy? Do we actually give him like a friendly face? That would be very funny. Where's the last one we've made? I think 15 has one, 14 has the paper ones. 13 shouldn't have one. 12 doesn't have one. 11 is uh... Oh, 11 definitely has one. Where did my text just go? Um... They are here. Okay. That was a little scary. I do not have a barnacle hatcher. Alright, he is very concrete looking. Hmm. Can I just make this yellow and then that's done? Oh, he's on the cart up there, interesting. Oh wait, nevermind. I actually don't need an underside for him. But I'm actually going to keep one anyway just in case. Maybe I should just get a more standard one, I don't think this is going to work out. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Did we even change his color? Or should we just put them in the sand? We could just put some sand around him and have him like half buried in there. I think that would look quite a bit better. I don't know. Come on. I need a faster computer. Okay. Okay. Okay. Where is my thwomp? Where did my thwomp go? Oh my god, I'm so upset. Isn't that what they must have felt like back in like 1500s when you were accused of being a witch and you were like being put into the Iron Maiden and like the daggers started going in your body? I imagine was very similar to my feeling right now. What am I even supposed to do? Browse Twitter? There's nothing new on furry Twitter. Furry Twitter is what I call Blue Sky. Maybe leftist Twitter is a better name for Blue Sky. Which is crazy. Could you imagine if we still lived in a world where the character limit on Twitter was 140 characters? How much better everything would be? Hello floofy worm. I did the cool render thing. Where instead of traversing graph nodes, we're traversing a comment list. What just happened? Do you see how it's in the top left corner saying 25 FPS just to like fuck with me? Oh my god, does it finally work again? Nope. Nope. What was I going to say? Do trees cause themselves quarantine? True, it is a quarantine. Hello Dunfair and Jurassic Jungle. Any thoughts on Linux? I kind of wish Linux would take off and become like mainstream usable and become the one thing people all use. But we don't live in that world. So for now, we have to deal with Windows. Read the change you want to see in the world. Yeah, I don't care. Fuck you, Immanuel Kant. Hello, I think it's now a meme. Ever since you posted by accident to the wrong post, it was funny to me. Yeah, we got so many responses that are all just saying Jurassic Jungle. It is pretty funny. Would you go back in time and kill baby Immanuel Kant? Keep in mind, yes, he did basically invent all of modern philosophy. Or well, he did invent the thing all people live by in modern day. But also, he was pretty racist and an anti-Semite. And also, I hate him for completely different reasons. You would be doing me a favor if you killed him. You would tickle him. I guess better than doing nothing. Fine, I cancel the animation. I hope there is an afterlife, just so I can meet Immanuel Kant and tell him he sucks. He ruined like every high school essay I had to write. He basically ruined my childhood. How do you know you aren't him? We'll end up in the same place though. Oh true, he's probably going to end up in hell. Bring him back to life and sit on the coffin? Good idea. What a silly little thing you're doing. I am leblancing my James. Sorry guys, sometimes I have a little bit of brain damage. Sometimes the brain worms just tell me to say a thing and then I just have to do it. Are you copying the French? Is that something the French say? Jesus is the only way to the Father and to heaven. Praise him. Really? How do you know that? Wait, nevermind, I just realized this is a bad discussion to have. To Lebron James is to jerk off in French? Like actually? This is like a French word that sounds like Lebron James? Or is this just a thing they made up? You know like jerking my shit means to jerk off, but it's also just a thing they made up. If you say fucking anything it sounds like jerking off. Is it gonna make sense in French that Lebron James would mean to jerk off? What the fuck? I'm over here scratching my hat if you know what I mean. Yep, that sounds like you're jerking off. Point proven. I'm over here stomping on my thwomp if you know what I mean. Okay, that one maybe doesn't sound like jerking off. I'm yanking my thwomp until it comes out. Yep, that sounds like jerking off. Jesus died on the cross for our sins, otherwise we would all go to hell because of our sin. Remember what happened to me from prayers to him, my back being healed and my tongue, many things. Sure, but just because miracles happen, you cannot logically conclude that this is the only way to go to heaven. What about someone who's never heard of him? What about someone who died like 10,000 years ago before language was invented? They wouldn't have heard of Jesus, they would have just died. What's that thing in French where you can use the word relative to charm under your blastoise? Or to joff your keelie? To charm under your blastoise. Not sure about that one. Sounds like you're tickling someone. I could drive to heaven in my car, I'm just too lazy to do it. I'm manuring my case, that also sounds like jerking off. That also sounds like jerking off. I made them in our image. It was in the Old Testament. Let's see. Guess I'm going to cut your hair now. You're going to what? Turo, I'd be sitting at the barber going like, what the fuck? Is this a haircut with a happy ending? The barber has to say like, you will now receive a haircut. And then I'll be like, okay, I'm, I consent to that. Hello Asakira. Yes, he is unable to move. Wait, I don't get poppers comments or maybe I do. Receiving a haircut and by haircut, I mean, getting my hair shorter. Me when I go to the barber for a hair job, as in a job done on my hair. I'm going to cut your hair. No, I don't want him to start mumbling. I want him to go at Mario right away. Maybe he's trying to eat your pencil, sketchbook, small concept thing. What? So? Share? You're never allowed to share? You're going to eat them all by yourself? Here's the sandbomb. Let's picture him on vacation on the penguin's eyes, everybody's stuck in the snow again. Would he be recognizable though? That didn't work at all. Yeah I'd do that. I will do it. There's actually two optimizations I did recently that I want to make videos about. There's so much shit I gotta make videos about, holy fuck. He is right here. I can feel his presence. What? Guys am I crazy or did I already type this in before? I'm going crazy. I swear I typed it in before. Okay he looks really stuck. I actually really like this. Do you have hints for bone animations? Yeah, it's on my to-do list. The thing is, someone else wanted to do them but then they never did. So I still need to make a script that converts them at some point. I do think it would be a decent optimization. Okay fine, we'll do that. That's not done what we all want. Yeah, no, quatrains are definitely going to be a big improvement. I already do it just blurb, but it looks fine for small enough values. Like of course it's technically incorrect but it's not really perceptible. No, I wasn't beginning, it's like a 10. Only affects the angular velocity curve and even that is very close. Yeah, exactly. Well, only the angular velocity curve. Okay, maybe I'm not quite understanding what I mean. But I think like goal positions here, start positions here. A slurp is going to get a position here. But a lerp might get a position like here. Not as extreme, but you get the idea. It's like offset on that plane. That's what would make sense to me intuitively. Why am I learning about this Nintendo YouTuber? Okay. Memories of Quatrain represents the same notation. This notation has been lerping. Scalar multiples of quatrainian? What? Scalar multiples of quatrainian? As in like a denormalized quatrainian? I mean, I guess they represent the same notation. So I guess I would do scale? Oh wait, okay, I was talking about Euler angles. Talking about my Euler angle lerping. And I guess scalar multiples for quatrainian would do that if you normalize the quatrainian again. Otherwise they would actually just scale the matrix down. Which is probably what's going to happen in my use case. Because normalizing is expensive. And considering how little inaccuracy that introduces, it doesn't really matter, I think. Oh, let's say no. Sending me a video of the booba, the baby. some text in a game like this. Have fun with that. I hate that I have to do this. Why is this even a thing? This shouldn't be a thing. This fucking sucks. What is this even for? What if I remove this? And this? What happens? Nothing, right? Oh my god. What if I replace these with just that? It's a waste of lifetime to use those defenses, is it not? By normalizing the matrix? Or what? How would you do it? It doesn't sound like a thing that would be entirely free of cost. From each unit vector u with q, u, q to the power of minus one. Request division. Division is even more expensive than a multiplication. And it's the same cost as a square root. So it didn't really gain anything. I prefer to just go un-normalized, honestly. It's just so much cheaper. Where are these defined? What does this all mean? How does this make any sense? These are not defined anywhere, are they? I don't get it. Did I not just delete all of them? Am I going insane? I just deleted all of them, no? This makes no sense. I didn't do this. I deleted all the German ones? Okay, for some reason it just works. I guess because that thing is so irrelevant that it's not actually being read there. So that field is just ignored. Cool. What am I doing? 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Send one first impression. Send one out of the same castle. Send one nice. Nicer. Nicest. Then we marry it. 4, 8, 8, 2, 4, 9, 3. We need to think of a way to program overworld stars. We need to give them star IDs. Um. What the fuck? Yes, you're helping him. He wants the sun castle to be gone. Alright, how do we do this? We need to manipulate our save file. The ground secret star is a U30. Oh, well, that makes this easier, so. We can store 32 stars here. Well then. Is he actually alive or is he schizophrenic? It would be funny to turn this into a Wilson situation. Cool. Cool. Nevermind. I regret doing that. I feel bad for him too. True, that's the issue. Cool. Cool. How does this work? Sure, this was the intention. And this is old code, so I don't really know what to do with this. Okay, well this is the mission. Oh, I'm just storing this in fucking wherever. Oh, I see. This is what we do. Unlimited bacon, no games, unlimited bacon, but no games. Hmm. I think I'll take unlimited bacon and no games. Actually, no, that's fine, these are zero indexed. A little bit of a dirty code there. That's old code, so to be expected. Two different HasStar ones, goddamn. That is annoying. How does star ID work here? Oh, it's not star ID, but it is... But it's Yoshi. It's a little easier to read. I think the exact same, your brain just perceives them to be different. I've heard that too. I don't think they've proven that yet, but that is the word on the street. Why would I be doing it, that's so weird. Popsi32, of course, I need to program that too, I almost forgot. We could just get this from online. Yeah, what the fuck. How is there just none? What the fuck, what is going on? Why is it assembly? There we go. That should do it. I don't have enough stars for him to spawn. There he is. So we know that works already. I think I want to program him in a way where he tells you to shush off if you get in front of him, but you can go all the way behind him and nothing happens. Then we gotta make him a little bit pissed if you ground pound him. Also, one of these vertices is missing vertex color. I was wondering how much were you paid for the Brick Android phones review vid, felt so out of place. The phone. Just the phone. They were like, oh, you want the new phone? All you have to do is show us the video of you trying it and then we'll give you the phone. I wanted it on my main channel, I was like, no, but I can do it on my second channel. My second channel is like maybe 15% of my first channel. First channel, they pay like 3000 a video. If I just take sponsors from my second channel and they're like 200 a video, I could upload like seven times a week. I could make like $8,000 a month. Holy, I need someone to find me sponsors for my second channel. From now on, every case clip will be sponsored. I could have, dude, they're in Hong Kong. They couldn't do shit to me, but I felt like I didn't want to scam them. Because it actually is a good phone, I like it. Huh. Is the thwomp not grounded properly? Huh. Well, that would certainly do it. No, they need to be at zero or it's not going to look right in game. It looks like the thwomp just beat himself. You think thwomps just pee sand? Wouldn't they be concrete? Alright, he still looks stuck like we want him to. Perfect. Alright, I think for today, that will be it. We got the school done, we got the sand thwomp started. Next time, maybe tomorrow, we're going to program the sand thwomp. I wasn't able to stream the last few days because I was working on my stupid optimization, but now that that's done, I think I can stream more again. Unfortunately, my vacation is almost over, but I'll see you next stream.
