Wait, my stream is just a black screen. Oh no, oh, there we go. So does this mean I get to be moderator? You can be a moderator if you want. Yes, please. I have the white privileges of moderation. Let me just... Where is it normally announced that we stream on the Discord? Hello, external mic. Oh, shit, you're here. Hello, Zamroy Wada. Oh, right here. Oh, my God. Bonus screen today. All right. Hello, Bioback. What's up, gamer? Hello, Yoshi Milkman. You did not... Well, I tried to use Twitch all throughout like last week to personally watch streams and it is so ad-riddled that I just can't stand it anymore. So I decided, hey, let's test out YouTube. Let's see if we still have people watching if I'm on YouTube. Maybe we even have more people. Let's see if the YouTube chat is comfy and nice. And if it is, then we might migrate. You're not VIP anymore? How do I give you VIP on YouTube? Yo shit, it's Dry Bones. Oh, I can mod you or I can ban you. I'll mod you. What about me? OK, you get modded too. Yay. But don't misbehave. Is that a challenge? No, it's not. You're going to get 3,507 year olds in chat. OK, 24,500 years old. OK, so we made some design changes to this. Again. So first of all, I increased the shading a bit. You see that, Bioback? I think the shading is a bit nicer. We got new wood here for the windmill. My captain just 64 by 64. It might be. I am actually not 100% sure. Well, it's not a new area. It's just updated the old Course 1 area again. And there's some shadows here to the mushroom. Some shadows to this right now. I love Flamespeed. I'm subscribed to him via Amazon Prime and I still get ads. That is terrible. That is absolutely terrible. It was only 32 by 64. Let me check. Twitch, I humbly request that you send me my money back. Actually, no. I humbly demand. I'm not sure about the hard shading on grassy edges. I mean, I tried to make this softer, right? Although, this right here is probably what you mean. This is a bit of a hard shading. I agree. It's a bit weird, but with the sun coming from there, it kind of makes sense. And yeah, basically, we're going to add these tutorial bunnies to Course 1 that are going to teach you the movements. So, this one's going to teach you the dive jump, which is just this. This one's going to teach you about the wall kick and the wall slide, which is also pretty baby mode. And this one is going to teach you about the spin jump, right? So, you kind of learn the movement while getting the coins. Hello, Messac boy. Let me check the Mario model for Yoshi Milkman. Question for you. When Bowser gets hit, you don't ground pound him after attacking you? Wait, let me think about this. How did the Bowser fight go? Oh, shit. This is very loud Mario Bunny music. So, I... No, you shoot rockets at him, right? You hit him over with a rocket. That's what happens. So, it wouldn't make sense if he's just on his back. It probably makes more sense that he lands on his belly. Yeah, maybe. Alright. That was good enough for me. Let's see if this is a 64x64. I should probably reduce it. Ah, yeah, it's 32x64. It really doesn't need to be any bigger, right? Because... You're not gonna see that. Thursday streams now? Or is this just a one-off? It's just a one-off. I have a week off work because of Easter. So... That's why I'm trying to Thursday stream right now. Just to gauge the interest on YouTube. Your model is a better one? Like a higher-res one or a better-looking one? Oh, your mustache. Yeah, something's off about Mario's mustache. Maybe it should be brownish? I'm not entirely decided. Anyway, let's work on the tutorial bunnies. I have done some more optimizations to the sine and cosine functions recently. Which are hopefully gonna be fun. Hello, Sayo? Sayo? Hello, Tux. Hello, Kubo. So many new faces. Which makes sense, because usually I'm on Switch. Yes, YouTube stream. Hello, Jane Cobb. Is Human F7 TV, MFZ and others? Or is it Twitch only? I'm not sure. But I feel like there would be a market for that. For someone to develop that. Hello, New. Hello, Fuzana. You can just rip geometry from your model and you'll be fine with that. Can you send it to me, Yoshi? So I can look at it. So he really just needs to wait for talk. And he needs to wait at the end. And he needs the action states for his things. So this one is jump, ground pound, dive. Let me just... Ground pound, dive. And this one is... Backflip. Ground pound, spin. Jump, slide. Jump, wall kick. Slide, wall kick. Bitch. Man, YouTube chat is a little hard to read, I find. It's kind of small in comparison. Have you got your header's path added to VS Code? Yeah, I don't know why it dissolves quickly. But if I click on it, I see it just fine. It also sometimes colors my variables in a weird way like this. I don't know what's going on, but it doesn't really matter. Vanguard, I'm glad you enjoy it. I saw the New Tears of the Kingdom trailer. It looks really cool. But it's hard to trust trailers, because it could be just a bunch of really cool cutscenes. Although it looked like they added actual dungeons, which I am very excited for. So I think Czech Talk High is giving us the new... Yeah, 256. This is giving us the new text IDs. Wait, Czech Talk High is using... BPM1. So, BPM1 and the text ID is 256. The YouTube emotes are wild, holy shit. Everyone thinks Ganon's hot. Hello, Bob's Blue. Hello, Game Boy. Yeah, the first stream I imagine is going to get a decent amount of viewers. And there's going to be a lot of questions from people that have not seen me stream before. So I imagine the first stream is going to be a bit rough for me. But after that, we should be fine. We don't have action... Yeah, we don't. It's defined. Where is this defined? Doesn't matter, it's always 107. Hello, Miro. Yes, this is very much a case clip. It's just a longer one. The only rule here is that you can't do anything.        Yes, that is my Twitch rule. Just don't get banned and you're fine. Is my work open source? It will be open source once it releases. Okay, ditch the Twitch, stay on YouTube. That's expected advice from a YouTube viewer, you know what I mean? If you only ask YouTube viewers whether they want you to stay on YouTube or go to Twitch... They're all going to say stay on YouTube. Or at least an overwhelming majority. And the opposite is true as well. So if you tell me to stay on YouTube, I can't really draw any conclusions from that. Can you stream on both at the same time? I've seen some people do that. That is a ban on both platforms. At least it's on Twitch, I'm not sure if it's on YouTube actually. Okay. So this one has zero jump, ground pound, dive. This bunny here has one. It seems like Twitch doesn't like to share its employees. Yeah, Twitch is a bit possessive. I had a manager like that once. I asked her if I could switch positions in the store I was working at at the time. And she told me I don't share employees. Which is really dumb when you consider it. Everyone should be cross-framed on everything. Well yeah, I think that's what happened to SimpleFlips when he was streaming on Facebook. And losing monetization on Twitch is going to be devastating. The only rule is not to get banned. So you kind of broke that rule. It's kind of... You got what was coming to you. Yeah, so Facebook was kind of worth it for him. 81, 82 and 83 is what we want. What? That's the wrong object. Okay, so we need to make tutorials here. And the tutorials need to be the most understandable way possible. And this is the ground pound life one. So how should the bunny personality be? Should they be, hey I got a sick trick for you. Wouldn't you like to try this? Or... Wanna know a secret? Yep, Twitch ads are so terrible.   I just quit using Twitch practically. I only use it as a streamer nowadays. I turned off non-skippable ads on this bot as well. Twitch doesn't let you do that. Twitch forces you to run an ad every 30 minutes. So that's like 2% of your stream is just ads. I'm gonna censor it. It's gonna be a sign, not a pop-up text. The N64 does not have the resolution for pop-up text. There's something above the bunny's head from the moment you finish talking to it. Don't know when I should get the coin. Oh, I see. That could work if we made like a texture. Like a tutorial texture. So it would be like the Z button and then an arrow to the B button. For like this one. I like that, I like that. Let me note that down. Um... TutorialBunnyTexture.h Let's see. B B-A A-A You talk to it first so that you can explain the move and your screen doesn't follow street trolls from all the bunnies. Yeah! There are way less viewers here. Well, no one even knows that I'm streaming and I just started streaming. Right. On Twitch, I have a rigid stream time. I have no idea how hard it is to get a job. I... I only applied for a job once and I got it immediately. Like in my entire life. And I got a job office before that. Alright, let's see. I'll let you in on a secret. If you are a man and you dress I think this works. You're casing out right now? Insane. No, I don't think there should be question markers. Calling is a thing, yes. Hello Clayton. Why not on the main channel? Because the main channel has way too many people. The main channel has 20 times as many viewers. So if you multiply this by 20 we'd be at 900 viewers right now. I would not be able to read a single message. No, I was not kicked off Twitch for being a straight white male. What? What? What? The first one is when I let you in on a secret. Maybe the second one should also be talking about secrets. See ya, Landy. Dude, look at this. YouTube's telling me this would be a good time to put an ad. I'm not putting one. I made Mario 60 Fortnite already. Way ahead, dude. I don't want to just paraphrase the first one. I don't even know what it's secret move. Something like that maybe. That's kind of paraphrasing it. Maybe in the tutorial it's good that they are almost the same. Because this makes it easier for the player to comprehend, I think. Because if you get one tutorial you're going to get the other one as well. The chat is not showing up on stream like usual. That's fine. Check this out. Now we're not making memes in here. Let's see. What you can do? You jump at a wall. You slide on it. Press A again to do wall jump. I think that works. Let me just check all the text real quick. These should probably be a bit wider. What are you doing right now? Making a mod? They are called wall kicks in Mario 64 because they are actually not the same as in the other. The wall jump is the one where you slide like this. And the wall kick is the one where you just go off. That's a debug overworld. It doesn't need to be good. Ah, shit. The boy softlocked me. Just for your baby eyes that are being hurt by pixels on the screen, I am going to skip that screen from now on. We're going to go right into the level. Are you working on extra missions today? No, we're working on mini-tutorials in the first overworld. He has hamburger. That is amazing. Is that British for hamburger? Hello. Allow us to see FPS debug in the final heart, please. Why? That's weird. Why would anyone harass me about these pipes? Pinkies are insane. That really sucks. That's unlucky. I know why the softlocked me. Can you still use armor crests? Well, there's no points here, so no. Well, I guess     I'll let you in on a secret. If you are in the air and you press Z, then B, you will do a mid-air dive. Okay, and then there will be a little cutscene of the bunny just doing this and this. Is the coin too far away? Okay, so obviously it's very easy to reach the coin, right? If you actually just fucking try, you will... If you actually just try, you will reach the coin. But it should be so easy that anyone will just do it first try. Even if you do a shitty jump like this. You can even just long jump to it. Though I have to think of another way to set this up. My points are invalid because I have an anime profile picture that says, you should make a level that's a totem but it gets invaded by aliens or troops or something. Shut up, anime profile picture. So, dive and long jump have the same length. They have different purposes. The dive gives you lower gravity, so if you jump really far off like this, you will go far, right? I go really far. But the dive lets you... It still has high gravity, so if you're not jumping far off, you will get further with the dive. Let me show you on flat ground. Like if I went from here, I would go until here. But... The long jump is not gonna go as far. Anyway, we need an easier way to do this, right? Like, obviously, it's easy to do, but it's not easy enough for Curse 1, for the tutorial. What if the bunny gives you the coin when you do the move? I mean, on one hand, yes, that is possible. On the other hand, it kinda defeats the purpose of showcasing the player how useful the jump can be. Movement in Peach's Fury felt like something about himself. The movement here is even better than the one in Peach's Fury, because we have applied a bunch of improvements since then. So hopefully, you'll like it even more. Also, I just found a weird shadow. I agree that Mario's a bit too dark in the ROM-Mac right now. And I do wanna improve that somehow, but I have not yet decided how that would happen. I could probably just make the light brighter on him. Hello, Brendan. How do you handle ground-pound dive direction? I let the player change the dive direction. I'm at the previous section for about 6 minutes versus 1.5 minutes for a slower play, I guess. Your direction changes by... ...by how much? Your direction changes by the difference between the direction Mario's currently facing and the direction you're holding, multiplied by the magnitude you're pressing, divided by the maximum magnitude. So if I'm pressing half-forward and I hold full... If now I'm pressing half-forward, Mario will do a 45° turn instead of a 90° turn, like that. Oh no, Mario's lighting is broken here, because I entered this through the debug menu. If I just re-enter the level, Mario will be lighter. But I think regardless of that, Mario still looks too dark. Right now he's a bit lighter. Yeah, let's make an object for the tutorial prompts here. How should they look? We have exclamation mark prompts for the overworlds that we can probably copy. How come the boat in the up-west white cap is a fire flower? That's a bug from really long ago. It's because we switched to... ...not allowing objects to share shade colors, because now shade is in the level itself. Which means that shade colors are all just set to white on objects. I'm not sure how long I... I don't remember what the bug would be. Okay, this looks terrible. Holy shit, this is crusty. We definitely need to update this. Oh my god, this is one of the oldest things made. Look how shit this looks. Let's fix it. I might still have the file somewhere. Yes, please. Crusty. I'm gonna add this to my bugs list. Thank you for the five bucks, Neskir. I did not expect someone to donate. Have you seen the follow-up suggestion? I have not. But if there's a ring, you have to pass using the move. And if you do that, he gives you the coin. That feels like... I mean, it kind of works if there was one of those rings in the sky. But then why wouldn't it work when you just long jump through the ring? My concern is that it's just gonna be a bit weird and confusing. Hello, Electricoon. That is the first YouTube donation. Ever. Did your model work all the area? I did most of it. And Biobak did a lot of revamping to make this look prettier. Can I give you the card when you're doing the right moves? Softlocks. Yeah, that seems fair. Yes, but that's also weird. If anything, we could move the coin up here. So that you can only get it by doing a backflip and then a dive like this. That's what I'm thinking, maybe. You're gonna learn the move, anyway. I think. There's gonna be multiple opportunities to learn it. I mean, technically, you could even skip this tutorial if you want. Like that. But like... No noob is gonna be that good. Did you say no stream? I'm just using NVIDIA Broadcast. Looks kinda funky. Some trees would make it feel more like a brushwood. Yeah, we could easily add a lot of trees. This level here runs almost 60 FPS on N64, so we can add whatever we want to it. I also recently added some stuff here to make this jump easier. Because I want this to be a nice first course. So, I'm thinking you should get the coin by doing something like this instead. And the bunny shows you that move. Although, I don't know if players will know about the backflip. And even if the player knows that, they could still just do that and get the coin like that. Mario's model is very upgraded. But... Biobak is right about the tutorial though. Is there a way to miss the... There is a way to miss the world shop tutorial as well. Okay, maybe we do have to go with the suggestion that Biobak made. So, let's make rings for players to go through with the specified move to get the coin. Alright, I'll note that down. We don't want players to miss the move. Is there any change custom or you started from a mod? No, this was started before, I guess before. Yeah, so since this looks like shit, let's just try and make a new texture. We should probably start from like a little ball. How do the Mario Galaxy tutorials look like? Maybe we can just... Hmm... We could have like two buttons like this in a speech bubble. Why would I not use my desktop? You know what? I probably have good versions of those in this folder right here. It's its own thing entirely. Oh, here we go. These will work. And then I need an arrow. Oh. It's called social standards. Nope. My machine is a modding machine and I will use my desktop for it. I'm not sure if a red arrow is elegant. It should be like a little rounded black arrow, I think. Hello, Tobias. This is kind of rounded, but not the way I want. Actually, maybe it's better not rounded. I'm thinking something like this. You recognize some of these textures? Yeah, I use a lot of just stone textures from other games. Easy to be productive when streaming? Uh... I mean, it forces you to stay focused, so in that way it makes you more productive, but like... It doesn't really make a huge difference to me. Oh shit, that's beautiful Mario Party music. What did I do? Oh, I just hit this. Can you use this one in Mario 64? I might have. Definitely an absolute gem, this one. Okay, let's just... I don't know if I should use a high-res image. Hello, Nata. I don't know if I should use a high-res image. The background of this one isn't even white. He doesn't even know we exist, for real. Oh god, that's a terrible scaling. Why does it look so terrible scaled down? What the hell? Hmm. This is not what I want. Oh god. This is all terrible. Oh god. I did not put on nearest neighbor. Can you put on a different OST? Yeah, sure, this one's over almost. Softcap, so when he jumps or something, you just slide with a lot of speed. He doesn't instantly get cut when landing. I'm pretty sure I used that in my mod, yeah. I think a Softcap is better. Remove any scale filters? I don't even know what that is. So you think it's the file itself that is fucked? Nope. It's fucked even in a new file. Comment for the Chamel, true. The curve is hard. No, that's not the curve. There's something else going on here. What the fuck is going on now? Inches? No, pixels. When you clean it up, that doesn't seem like it would be necessary. I mean, this looks a little better. Let's just try and make our texture out of this. The best we can. Honestly, I only need to do a temporary texture. We can still improve it later. This just kinda has to look like a speech bubble in the end. Why is this also terrible? He's not an artiste. Actually, he is. He's just not a visual artist expert. Do you want the speech bubble without the exclamation mark in it? For the Yoshi? No. Okay, I think this should just be like a curved arrow above them. And then this will fit nicely.            Fit nicely into the texture. Can you get my image for them to make the dark lighting on a recess? I have no idea what that is. Let's just get a curved arrow. There's gonna be a good one on Google, I'm sure. This is what I was thinking. I wanted this. Let's actually rescale this once we have this in here. I think this works. Now we just put this in a speech bubble. Just I made the buttons one after another, so you don't need to... Okay, but then how would the player know to press Z first and then A instead of A and then Z? I don't know.           I don't know. Z plus A. Well, you have to press Z and then A. Okay. Okay. I need this to be a speech bubble. Z and A need to be pressed at the same time eventually, so it doesn't matter. No, they don't. You have to press Z first. Like, actually. It should not be on the one side, no. Let them think that Gershon, that's fine. Okay. God, I really made this A button crusty. And we'll be fine once we actually have everything in there, though. We needed a little bit of a rim for the speech bubble to fit out in. Okay. This one implies that you press Z, release it, then press A, which would not be a problem with that animation. You need to hold Z while pressing A. You don't need to hold Z. You just need to press Z and then sometime after A. You could make the texture animator show the button style down in order. Z down, Z and A down, then reset to none. You just need to press Z and then at any point in the future A. I think this communicates that. You can do it in one frame, you can do it in five frames. No, it's not for long jumping. It's for the spin jump. We should probably copy the Mario Galaxy design here. We should probably copy the Mario Galaxy design here. Oh, speech not speech bubble. So they have these textures here, but they don't have this one. It's just a rounded rectangle. I'm sure I have a texture like that somewhere, premade. Hello, Alex. I'll just make it out of this texture here. Oh, that's not what I want. We have a bit of a problem with the alpha layer on the N64. Because if we want these colors, alpha can only be 0 or 1. So we do have to be... We should set these to 0 or 1, like from the get-go. Like so. You can see the Twitch chat on screen. Oh, shit. You can. I'm not live on Twitch, though. No. I'm gonna have to... Shit. I'm gonna have to...   Goodbye. Fucking trolls. That was a good one. That was a good one. RIP nothing of value. Okay, so the Z doesn't quite fit into the speech bubble here if we do this. We can possibly- No, we can't. We can use a fucked up resolution, can't we? What are your Mario movie thoughts if you haven't told them yet? That was kind of fun. Why would I do this to you? You deserved it. And then there should be like a little thing at the bottom to make the line to the rabbit. I'm thinking maybe they should have a black outline. Why is the outline not like actually black though? This is supposed to be a speech bubble, yes. Oops. Like this. There's a stroke option. Okay, but isn't the stroke outer? Yeah. It can be outer. Do you invert the stroke? To make it inner? Oh, do I do that? Oh, position inside. Oh, oh. Nice. Who's smart? I'm smart. Okay. This looks very gamey though. That should be a bit anti-aliased, I think. Don't end at the bottom at the same location. Yeah, you're right. That should be fixed. The problem is- Oh, shit. The A button is bigger, so- Or is it? I think the bottom problem is with the arrow. You fixed your speech bubbles. They no longer look crusty. I see. Oh, yeah. That is much better. We'll import them some later time. Now I think the inner shadow look better. Oh, boy. What if we do both? And we make the stroke... What if we do this? Huh? That's pretty. What is he trying to do? We're making a little tutorial for the new moves. The tutorial is going to be pretty unintrusive. And hopefully it's going to be easy to understand. From this image, would you understand what to do? I hope you would. And if you don't, I lose my faith in you as a human being. That depends on which combiner you're working with. There are many reasons to use different types of textures. It really just depends on what you want. Let me just store this as a file. So I can just... So we need an alternate version where it's AA. And then we need an alternate version where it's ZA. ZB. Here's about spelling, though. Not in my variable names. Press Z, then A? I first thought press A and Z. Cool. That's what I've been telling him. Could you make a button press animation like Z is pushed and then as soon as it is released, A is pressed? I don't think that's necessary. Because you don't need to release it. And I think this conveys the movement pretty well. All right, let me make these all into an object. What is this? As soon as he asked if it did, someone told you to write it wrong. They were fucking with me. No way someone misunderstood that. No. Wait, what? Are you dying? What is that? Do you mean do it as Romhack? If so, then no. Gamers are stupid. I agree. But that guy was definitely trolling. Oh, good. This texture looks fucked. Oh, that's because of Photoshop. So Photoshop likes to blend the edges with white. That's not GIMP. That's fucking Bing. So for the interpolation to work properly, we have to paint the background black once. Delete it. I know that looked like I am just doing some stupid shit, but that is an important step. And then we have to index it. There we go. No, Biobak. The guy in chat was trolling. No way someone misunderstood this to mean press A first. There's an actual arrow. There's like a universal sign. Yo, what is the meaning of this? No way. I have little faith in gamers, but come on. That's like too little. This sign makes no sense. I don't get it. What does that mean? How does this game work? It makes no sense. I don't get it. Why can't I put the square into the hexagon? I don't get it. I'm losing it. The B button is yellow. What am I supposed to do? I mean. I don't get it. You have to be very careful with the text you put. Because the players they start out with some amount of patience left for your game. And depending on how much they were looking forward to your game, that amount of patience is higher. But for a romhack, you can't really go over your patience budget. That's why I really want to make sure that everything is as concise as possible. Because with the romhack you have the disadvantage that no one paid for your game. So there's no initial commitment from the player. And because the N64 on 64x64 images can only have 16 colors. And transparency. This one. Something something dithering. I don't think dithering is a good idea here. I kind of don't like how the B button looks on this image. My chat is woke and other buzzwords? No! Lilaa did you miss when a guy asked me if I got banned off Twitch for being a straight white male? My chat is not woke. Don't worry. My chat is whatever the opposite of woke is. I think this is more readable. That's right. I mean, it is a 64x64 texture. Would you like more pixels to the image? I wish I could. Ah, it's faster to just reload it instead of ALT R with the image selected. The new blender version is fucked. Should we also move the A button now that we moved the B button? I think so. Hello, robot. Is Jeff Bezos woke now or something? What did I miss? Since when is YouTube the anti-woke site and Twitch is the woke site? I must have missed something. Oh my god, the YouTube comments are so fucked. Have you seen the YouTube comments section? Yeah. Shit, Fazala made them resign? Billionaires are scared of this one man. Beast and Mario Pelt. Oh yeah, that looks a bit more readable, I think. Hello, chat. You mentioned segmenting things out into different areas of Mario 2 Pro Speed, right? Yes. Good to me. Dude, this song reminds me of Madsomen. You guys know the Madsomen song? Yes, I am German. The Z looks too small? That's fair. Shit, do we have to export all this again and rescale the Z? Fuck, I hate this. I'm just gonna be stealing this one texture for 20 minutes at this point. Do I or do I not do it? Well, I live in Canada now, so we're not neighbours anymore. Okay. I mean, that is one concept. I called it Icache blocks, where I have a block of code that's always 0x400 bytes, right? So if you look at my map file here... I made sure that all the rendering functions are within the same block of code here. With some libultra stuff up here. So that this all fits into the same Icache. But the dcache is something separate. Wait, yeah, how come no one asked about Zeina yet? Usually a bunch of people ask me who that in my background is. I think most people already know. On YouTube? I don't think so. Possibly. But I do have something cool to show you. It's not finished yet. But I'm loving how this is turning out. Alright. Bye, robot. Bye bye. Yes, yes, yes. Of course, I do have a lot of dcache optimizations as well. You don't have to worry about that. No, what I meant by the memory segments is something completely different. I have a lot of dcache optimizations in my promec. Yeah, the Z button is huge now, but not in the way I want. Yeah. Yeah. What Nintendo enemy, like, bouncing animations for when he gets hit, for when Bowser gets hit by the- No, I'm not just gonna offload my work to someone else. That is cringe. I think this works. This text should be illegal. Whoa! Do I have to make these? I'm probably gonna remake these anyways. Oh my god. Okay, I will just save this one more time. And then, if someone else wants to edit this, they are free to do so. But that will be my final version. Yeah, we'll remake this text just anyway. Nothing I can do about it. Great. Not too surprising. In that case, I'm not even gonna fucking bother with this. Fine. I'm just gonna port these for now as placeholders. I see the Z button popping out, but the A button does not. The A button does pop out. My honest reaction is to see annoyed Mario. Oh shit. It is not. So these should probably billboard around this point here. Okay. This needs to be a switch. And it should be AnimState. Nice. Streamer viewers, I'm catching. How are you doing? I am doing well. The A button has volume, but the Z button doesn't. Yeah, true. That's because of the color indexing. Yeah, that's a bit shit. I agree. It's fine though, because these are actually not just placeholder textures I just found out. Thanks for watching! I don't know what a flight gradient is. But this is an indexed texture, so we can't use gradients. That's like the opposite of what you can do with an indexed texture. And without indexing this texture would have to be 64 by 32. In which case this just wouldn't fit on there anymore. Robots don't require an armature or anything. You can do whatever you want, just do the matrix math. The billboard matrix is pretty easy, you can push this whenever you want. All you have to do is just copy the billboard matrix. And the billboard matrix has some things filled out by the camera. So we make three textures for the buttons and one texture for the arrow. I find it easier to pre-bake the textures like that. That is a lot easier to do than programming what you're asking for. Although we could make the textures like two textures if you really want the Biobak. We can make them like 127 by 63. Or you know two textures, whatever you want. Honestly you can just edit the model and then I can just import the model. Like that works for me. It needs to be billboarded, I think I can just... Is there no flags? Float maybe? There is a flag, why did I not find it? Find it. What the fuck? Okay, this should make the billboard appear above the heads. Since it's almost the same every time. You can just not index the bottom part and get two textures. Oh, yeah, yeah. That absolutely works. They all say ZA. No. But the billboard looks fine. And this is easy to understand. If you guys look at this and you tell me you will not think to press Z and then A. I am going to be very upset. I don't get it. Is the arrow on the controller? What? There's no arrow on here. Yes, the billboard will appear after the bunny jumps. I just rendered it, it's like a test. Unfortunately, the test fails because it did not set the enum state. This one doesn't affect the enum state, does it?  Okay, you know what, Biobak? You get to make the billboards. You can make them even more understandable if you want. Things seem to be pecking. Then this because of Z depth. I just need to move it up a little bit so it's not above the bunny. Let me get some shake. I feel a bit hungry. How did you decide where to start? I don't really remember the other day and took one look at it and almost fainted. You just kind of start every once. Just like think of something you want to do it and do it. And you'll learn the crossface just by doing. Just do it. So. The curved arrow kind of makes you think about rotating the joystick. Oh, I can't bend it. Why is it YouTube now? Because Twitch is kind of going to shit. It's so full of ads that I just don't enjoy using the website. If you want me to make the audio channel, please change it. Okay, I can show you what it looks like without a video broadcast. And you can tell me whether you prefer it. Now you will be able to hear everything. I saw the new Zelda trailer. Yes. Adblock does not work. I literally have six adblockers and none of them blocked them on Twitch. So. I don't know why DPRM2 is not doing. Oh, I know what the issue is. This was a stupid, stupid mistake. Who's your most talented co-worker? Ed Gears? I find that very hard to say. Because I don't really know what the other people are working on. Okay, this is what we want. And that one says AA and this one says ZB. Okay, we just need to remove the ZA for the ZB. Like this one needs to be the ZB one. I'm having more fun getting almost solutions from ChatGPT. I've been using ChatGPT a fair bit during my normal work. It's useful, but it's not as crazy as a lot of people would have you think. Give it a little longer. The coins are 64 by 64. It's the same resolution as that image. The exact same. And don't worry about ZFoxy. Biobak will end up doing this. Oh, I think. Yeah, you see that? You see the shadow look through? It's on the wrong layer. Needs to be layer four. Um, we did not really think of a solution for the coin here, did we? Oh, wait, we did. The rings, of course. We're gonna make him stay far away from SM64. Yep, the engine sucks. It's the worst one. Aren't the rabbits casting shadows? We do the shadows at the end. Currently, there's an issue with the tooling that makes shadows a little bit annoying to do. So. Wasn't this? Wasn't this in RTMI at some point? Oh, great. We have doxxing in the comments. Wait, did I define this wrong? I do this so rarely. Oh. And there should also be a timer. So, we will animate them all with zero at first. Just because we don't have the animations yet. So, rabbits, how about the transverse signs? Like, blurb after sign. No, we need the bunny to show you the movement after textbox. And then the bunnies will have to blurb. It's cuter and it makes more sense, I think. Find a way to make it a single 64x6 vertex with all three signs. Okay, you know what? I'm just gonna send this to you and then you can do that if you want. Wait, what did you send me, Zeina? Zeina? Yes? What did you send me? I sent you a video. Ah, should we watch that on stream or? Watch it on stream. Okay. Skip to the 0.3 mark. Hmm, it looks a little like he's not rotating around his actual middle. What do you mean? Like, he's flying backwards and then spinning and then flying forwards again. Right, you see that? Yeah. Like, the point where he's rotating is like here in the background. Yeah, I knew that. Don't worry, you're making your own. You need to base it or it would be better if you place it on the front. I mean, this little bounce is pretty good though. Yeah, I like the bounce. Everything except like the point where he rotates around. I mean, that's kind of hard to do because his root is like... Move it. You just have to move him. Yes, I'm moving the root. But it's tricky. Just because of where the root is. Probably making from scratch is a lot more work, Riolu. A lot of the romecs, a lot of the games I have seen during the N64 jam were like a lot worse than the incompatible romecs, just like from a performance standpoint. So based off of that... Well, this is two hours of relaxing N64 music, so Diddy Kong Racing is in there. DKA the most. Yes, true. Who wouldn't like DKR to relax? I'm gonna mention where he plays the piano before the Haunted one. There is a video of that on YouTube already. So... Am I doing this wrong? Of course. CasinoLuigi, how does Mario 64 handle lightning? Does it manually create shadows with textures and vertex colors? Have you changed the approach of shadows? Yeah, that's what it does. And I have not. It's honestly just optimal to just bake them. Dude, I hate the Mario 64 soundtrack. So... The Mario 64 object shadows are done so poorly. Like, if you are in Rainbow Ride and your game lags down to 25 FPS, a reasonably skilled programmer with like five minutes of time could have fixed the shadow system so that that runs at 30 FPS. All the optimization they did in Mario 64 combined is less time saved on the renderer than just fixing the fucking shadow system in five minutes. Hmm. Oh right, I still need to make a move. Make a ton of vehicles. Can you get all the money or is there a good way to automate it? You can automate it. There is... Right, if you look at this, you can just... This is a... We have the setup for this here, but like... Basically... Well, basically you can make light from here, it's just... Oh, I guess the light's coming from the top right now. So this is the light color, this is the ambient color. Right, and now you have shadows baked that come from the top. You could even, if you wanted to, you could even like make this play in Mexico. Just setting the light to yellow. Now it's in Mexico. Or you could put this to night mode. Now it's night. Cozy reference, yes. The cozy Smethos. So... All right, let's see if the bunny does what we need. And then we just need like a dummy action that does nothing. Goddard code is a horror show? Poor Goddard. I just don't use the Goddard code. I mean, it's also an individual screen where it's like... Phones doesn't really matter that much. Okay, so the bunny tried to do the thing. It just kind of failed at it. Interesting. Okay, it's because I did this in the wrong order.  I have returned. Welcome back. Also the bunny is going way too far. Dude, Mario 64 could have been so much cooler if they made like a custom song per stage. That's also not good. Is bouncing is a negative number or a positive one? I forget. It's a negative number. And the jump needs to be like a lot higher. The same grass song on four levels. Yep, they were really proud of that one. But like imagine if Tick Tock Clock had a custom song. How cool would that be? Okay, it's still going way too far and it's doing the spin jump way too late. The Mario Kart DS. Yeah, that one would have been so cool. I don't for a second believe that Mario 64 was supposed to have 60 levels. Alright, this is getting there. It's just weird how much it slides at the end. Oh, you think they just wanted to make a 3D Land type game at first? How can you conceive 32 levels and then the 15 levels that you cut it down to have like Snow Snow World, Snow Snow World 2, Fire Fire Land, Fire Fire Land 2, Grass Grass Land, Grass Grass Land 2, Grass Grass Land 3? The money doesn't do shit. It's not even simulating physics. It's just actually kind of simulating physics, but still. Okay, so we put the ring like right there, right here, and that's the ring you have to go through. Then I think Mario should be able to do this very easily. Okay, I've had the big houseboat, true. Nathaniel Boundly every time. It was actually so funny to me how much celebrity worship there was in the SimpleFlips Nathaniel Boundly competition. It's crazy. The guy must have felt like a god for a week. Okay. Let's make the ring. What do we make the ring like? Should we make it like one of those Yoshi's Island flower type rings? Yeah, it makes it look more like a tutorial. I mean, it was always supposed to be just like the beginning playground to get used to the physics. But now we kind of maximize on the concept. This is what it looks like. I don't think this would look good though in this context. Sprite based particle rings. I mean, this would be sprites if we did that. Hello, Dawn. Why YouTube? Because Twitch is getting worse and worse. I might go to YouTube. It's not decided yet, Dawn. An SMB red coin ring. Yeah, that looks decent too. I don't know. It's not decided yet, Dawn. Don't worry. This is just like a test stream. Are you a favorite Lilaa? I mean, there's a lot of Lilaas around. Don't you think it would be rude for me to answer the question? I would be putting down all the other Lilaas. I mean, a ring like this would probably look kind of bad because this is going to be a low poly on the N64. I mean, a ring like this could look kind of nice. We can also make it look like the gold rings in Koopa Wave Curve. The original game does have rings like that, but they're all ass. Where's Koopa Wave Curve? Like, we could be using these. Maybe make them like the same color as the egg coin. Bit too flashy, yeah. What are Purple Coins for? If you collect five, you just get a star. They replace the 100 coin stars. The Flower Loves Me SM64DSP game. What's that? I don't think that looks like a ring at all. Let me check that out. Yeah, that's not it. There might be like three 100 coin missions as like one of the Yoshi missions, like special missions, but I don't want them in every stage. They're just octagons. Great, this is not what I was looking for. I was looking for stuff like this. How do rings usually look like in Mario games? What about the green stars? Oh, can we make an egg-shaped ring? Can you do it with curves, like animated curves in Blender, like I was doing for my my assignment earlier? We can have something follow along a curve, but what would follow this curve? Maybe just the egg shape and the egg dots. And a couple curves. Oh, you mean like have like a dotted line in the middle of the egg? Kind of, yeah. We don't really need curves for that, but it would be possible. Can Luigi rip the red coin model ring from his Mercedes? But I don't want that. Particles. Particles of what? Yeah, yeah, I know, my particle system is amazing. A particle ring could be cool, but like how do particle rings look like? Shady idea. What idea? I think flowers are so ugly. Yeah. Something like this. Oh. I do like this. Hello, Deagle Ninja. I don't know the Minecraft stuff. We could have star particles around the circle. I feel like all of that is really weird, though. Yoshi's Island sparkle rings. Let me check that. Did you mean this? We went, oh, oh, oh, yes, actually, yes. This might be it. So. Let's try something like that. So. I don't stream on YouTube usually. I usually stream on Twitch. That's probably why you've never seen me. So. Shut these egg coin rings. Okay, so if we do the rings, actually, we can move this bunny down here. Because we don't need him here. And that's kind of a weird spot, especially because there's the retro part right next to it. You can bring up clip rotation using Windows V. Oh, interesting. I did not know that. So. But yeah, considering that we're just using the ring now, we should probably move him like here. So. So. So. Oops. Oh, my keyboard switch languages. D forward, D left and D Y. Let me just check out if this is correct now. Oh, we need to define the behavior. So. You can rotate clockwise and counterclockwise or something. I was thinking of just having the particles spawn in a circle. Oh, I'm back here. Let me just. Before anyone's eyes hurt from pixels on the screen. It should probably be a lot faster. So. Oh, hey, Nanook, that is good to hear. Okay, that's kind of cool. You guys think this is good? Oh, that's cool. Any chances I should make? I'd say maybe slow it down a little bit. That's about it. Half speed or what are you thinking? Maybe just half speed. Half speed might look weird, but let me try. Might have to make the particle exist longer. Maybe it's a particle lift longer. We could do this. Okay, let's make a particle that lives longer than this. So. So. Something about this feels wrong. I think there's one property missing here. I don't see what Yoshi said. What did Yoshi say? If you had two rings inside each other, one spinning slightly slower. I mean, I can try that. I think it's in the flags. 0x40. Yeah, it's because of this flag here. Okay. That's why the crash happened. I knew something was up. Okay. Yep, that's what I thought as well. But if we just do this twice, that kind of looks bad. Okay. Okay.  My stream crashed. I hope I'm still here. Oh, that looks pretty. Oh, that's very nice. My stream crashed? I just got a message that my stream crashed. I guess it didn't actually happen. Okay. Okay. This is kind of a disgusting code to make. This feels like shit. I don't want this. Let me just fix the code. I don't want my code to be disgusting. Okay. Okay. Okay, that's better. Okay. Okay, that one should be down a bit. Just so anyone can reach it. And everyone will make it through here. I'm sure. Wait, something about this has gotten weird. Wait, that's not the intention. There we go. There we go. It should be on the x-axis. Yeah, that seems like a good idea. No, I just had the y1 and the y2 swapped. I just forgot to replace the 1 for the 2. That's literally it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh wait there's... okay We have to actually also make sure that Mario was in the correct action state beforehand I don't know why VS Code is shitting itself I must have like updated it on accident but for some reason the autocomplete is not there anymore and it's making my variables the wrong color so i'm gonna make sure it compiles it does and i don't know why i did this so and we don't need this whole system here because there's only one action state wait should they activate after you talk to the bunny or should they always be active i feel like they could be confusing otherwise i feel like they should only be there after you talk to the bunny because i wouldn't want people to try to interact with them beforehand cool yeah only when you talk to them i think as well so let's cache this so so once again long jump through the ring which is confusing yeah but you will only get the thing if you do what the bunny says okay that seems to work no time to add a model but check out that sweet ass texture all right let's see let's see how much of a baby i can be in misunderstanding this i will be the biggest baby you've ever seen i will put the fucking hexagon through the square hole what what am i looking at is this supposed to make me understand z plus a now i get it i guess i guess it kind of works but my a button screen assuming you're playing on an on a real nintendo 64 simple solution fuck you okay but can you make these like normal textures i don't want them in the fucked up texture like that it's easier for me if you just make them simple textures honestly i think that's what he intended to do so you can just copy paste no i think he wanted to make this in one material to save texture memory but these are going to be three different objects so we can't save texture memory that way anyway yes i was just being a baby i mean can you see that that's actually what i did right before stream i was just dead lifting 400 pounds there digitally my workout equipment is right next to me he always has it there i just kind of work out all day we don't even have room for a proper couch yes so this ring size enough i feel like no just that's a margin of error the neighbor's downstairs yep that's why we live on the floor hello pg lover yesterday is an exception so i find she's kind of hard to watch so this is fine don't worry about it i know this is not the perfect code but it's fine so so so so so  keyboarders in my head they wanted me to turn off nvidia broadcast you guys asked for this when will you learn that your actions have consequences you freaking freaks so i'm not albanian the fuck so i should also make these guys rotate to mario and face a certain way when the game starts they should rotate to mario if you get close enough so so compute the angle to mario they do this is returned here to silent 64 so now if i get close they're gonna notice me looks very similar to mario's movement i think this is a pretty cute tutorial hello pixel craftian wait you can recall messages on here that's crazy only this guy's missing now okay i noticed something this right here needs to be climbable the reason this needs to be is so that mario slides less on it because climbable surfaces in this game are programmed so that when you wall slide on them you slide slower that makes this a bit easier i've been programming this for almost three years now but we are getting close to finish well i mean like 70 percent maybe although like all the engine upgrades are done now mostly we're still upgrading it it's a journey you can't just call it finished now the speech bubble has to be above the bunny so only two years i didn't even know that i mean that's the thing when you make games it always starts like really fun and eventually it turns into pure torture that's just the cycle of making games so i mean there's a lot of people starting their mod and they're just quitting if you look at the rate of what's getting finished for major projects like this it's below four percent right that's why i always tell people to start with a small project otherwise they are just going to not get anything done at all so the banjo hack is almost finished i can show you guys a real quick progress update so working on clickhawk loads last time okay big spoiler but we were basically finishing the boss fight here last week i mean it's even worse for other hack projects look at ocarina of time look at like first quest i think it's been in development for like 13 years 14 years look there's a secret area in this one you probably don't remember this from banjo kazooie what does the eye represent that's a debug thing it's mingyongo i want to port that hack over into the rty engine before it's done  it's like a bonus thing i guess so just a real quick button well i mean it's like i mean that much work it's fucking mingyong life's not all about quidditch you know fucking we play the harry potter game and now that's like what british people sound like to me life's not all about quidditch you know have you seen anything interesting potter fucking ridiculous so dude the last time i made a romhack against climate change mars subs climate change 64 nintendo took it down they are actually pro climate change cool trick bunny really beautiful love it  definitely a nintendo moment why was he not moving the hell maybe this is not enough frames but i don't know so oh wait what's wrong with switch there's just so many ads around that i don't like using the website anymore why does the text box go very wide for a frame i think that's a weird interpolation thing what is it that's ethan calling me oh i will call him back in a minute actually i'll call him after stream's over all right i mean you know you know twitch is bad when they're giving you ads when you're subscribed to a user yeah that's really bad that is unforgivable okay i had the values rotated whoops so i have a plan here okay hello nerp you're eating cookies and cream and ice cream cool i love cookies and cream ice cream when you're done your cut we're gonna get down there and ice cream you like getting the asterisks that's cool most people think they're way too difficult and they hate the game because of it okay that was starting to look decent okay i almost like it okay it just needs to be a rotated bar so let's try this the forbidden website what's that so no i'm getting abducted they're gonna all the virus tools that you use and they're gonna nope i have not i have had tutorials before but nintendo always takes them down so that kind of puts a dent in my motivation to make tutorials so Lilaa post the resources thing i don't have it why can't you not post it is that the Lilaa you know is that Lilaa oh he landed weirdly yeah yeah i will absolutely make the robots a cutscene don't worry I can't do that right now. They haven't sent a C&D over this game to me, they really liked it. Yeah, probably, because this is kind of technically illegal for me to do. Yo, thank you for the money, old seagoat. Alright, that was kind of a poor looking cutscene. So he doesn't crash into the wall like that. Okay, so there's one problem with the bunny cutscene here, and that is, unfortunately, depending on where you put the camera in the beginning, you're not gonna see this very well. Oh, and this is a problem too, cool. The fucking scam bots are getting so funny. Warriors of the Imperium. Did you guys see that screenshot? So let's set up, probably shoot the camera, see how this works out. Yeah, I should just force the camera here. No, what are you pinging me for? What do you think I'm missing, C4land? Level design? There were a few levels that are kind of a miss, that are a bit too weird, like the bathroom level, and 2-1, but I think overall, it's a pretty solid formula to make a relatively risk-free and fun game. I think especially the casino in World 7 is one of my favorites. Okay, this should make the bunny force the camera to be in line with it. It did not, cool. Maybe it's the physical position. It's one of these variables. No, fuck. I think the cutscene camera is different.  Right, it's because it's in here. And then it should be the star cutscene, right? Cutscene star spawn. Okay, so this doesn't adjust C position at all. So, if I just do this, it should move both the physical camera and the visual camera. I'm not making the camera focus on the bunnies. Look, if you make the camera rotate without the player being able to predict it, you're always gonna have to play a whole direction that they don't intend, because there is human reaction time of like 200 milliseconds in-game time. That's why we never actually have the camera do anything without the player somehow forcing that. Right, so if I move around, you see that the camera moves, but the camera just follows Mario with the minimal rotation. If I walk the camera into a wall, you see the camera moves out of the way, right? But it's always stuff where it's like the player is causing it directly. There's never an object in the overworld that does it. Did that work? That looked fine to me. Okay. Yeah. Ah, goddammit. Yep, I hate the galaxy camera. Okay. Isn't the camera in Galaxy bad because of what mathematicians call the Harry Ball theorem? It's a weird thing. It's a weird thing. The Harry Ball theorem. It's a real thing. You guys don't believe me. The Harry Ball theorem is a real thing. It's not a ligma. I swear on my life, on everything I own. They don't believe me about the Harry Ball theorem. I swear they knew what they were doing back then. I know that there's another cutscene where we do this, but I don't know how I did it back then. It's the prepare cannon cutscene. Well, it's kind of really fucking dirty. Well, it's terrible. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What if we just add all the variables here and then one of them will just randomly be it? Okay. I'm thinking of adding multiplayer to it, and then it would be unlocked from the beginning. I'm not letting ChatGPT program my ROMEC. Are you crazy? Okay, that kind of worked. Okay. Wait, how is there no more OPC? I literally see it right here. Okay. I think this is the only cutscene where we need to hard code the values like that. What's a noogie? I don't think I've ever been given one. What is that? Is that one of those American high school things? What is that, like putting my head in the toilet or something?  Oh, it's this one. No, no. Noogie noogie. Gotcha. You and your big meat arms. Too strong for me. Some monkey scrap. All right, I think the tutorial bunnies are perfect. They just need animation. Maybe we should make one change to them, and that is that their text disappears if you have the coin. Because that means you know how to do it. Okay. Okay. So this is coin ID 2. And that's MIPS ID 2. It's coin 0. MIPS 1. Okay. So let's just beep M4. Okay. It's a monkey. I should jump back down so you can actually read the bubble. Fair. I'll make him jump back down. Fine. Okay. All right. Let's make him jump back down. That's actually going to be somewhat annoying to do. Okay. Let's try it. Gotta make sure your game doesn't contain bad game design. Oh, really? I had never considered that. All right. I'll make sure my game doesn't contain bad game design. Good call. I'm so glad that guy warned you. Could have been a big disaster. Yep. That was a disaster in the making. But now we know. All right. That almost worked.      Make sure you... Oh, shit. I've been coding so many of them. Can you guys even see this bug here on screen? Right there at the grasshopper? Oh, you can kind of see him in the wood. Come here, you bug. Okay. He's gone.     I think that's cozy. The text box doesn't disappear as I want. Why is the lighting getting messed up? I didn't even notice. Probably the sparkles. Why is the lighting getting messed up? Nope. It's not the sparkles. Mars is too dark. Oh, that's because this is the debug level warp. It adds the dark light from the current Bowser level instead of the level light here. I thought of ray casting towards the light direction to make Mario's lighting more accurate. Yes, yes. I might do that. Probably gonna do that for the lens flares. Did I export the level after adding the bunny IDs? I'm not sure. Okay. Progress. Okay. Alright, we got it now. No, I coded it back and the guy told me not to and I still did it. There we go. Okay. Alright, all that's missing now is the animations. I'll be doing those on Saturday. Very nice. Well, we're done here. We finished the bunny tutorials. That's gonna be all I'm doing on stream for today. I hope you guys enjoyed this. If I'm not gonna stream on YouTube again, make sure to check out my Twitch. I can't guarantee it. I still am on the fence about it. And I'll see you guys next stream on Saturday. Bye bye. Bye bye.
