Hello. Can you all hear me properly? Is it all good? I think my voice might be a little louder today than usual. Okay, very good. Hello Adespo. Oh yeah, here in Canada we're going to change time on Monday, I think. Can you hear me nice and good? Hello Kevachten. What is this level? This is a mentor, right? I'm actually not sure if I like the mentor ray entrance here anymore, now that I think about it. Guess we had a mentor ray surfing level planned too. Hello Mimoski, hello Selton. I think we should change how that works. So initially the idea was that there would be a secret level entrance here that opens up after you beat up the clouds here. And the entrance would be around this part, but maybe that's a bad idea. Oh, that's a side level. We're putting the entrance to the side level today, that's our mission today. Meowdy partner. Oh my god, it's almost Halloween. Wait, Halloween is in like three days, oh my god. We need a safe block in this part of the overworld. Desperately. Let's add one. Yes, yes, yes, they're going to see it as soon as we place down the entrance. We're just going to go through the level. Any OST wishes today? Maybe a playlist? Maybe like a good playlist, Nintendo Halloween music? Do we find anything? I actually probably thought that was neat. Right, so we have the wind flower slide here, and we also had maybe a manta ray surfing level planned. So I'm thinking maybe we don't want two manta rays, but maybe we should want two manta rays. I actually think actually now that I think about it, two manta rays is good. Let's do two, fuck it. This castle ground is not group 12, this is intended. Maybe I should play Luigi's Mansion. Yeah, there's so many games I want to play. It's kind of weird. My entire PC is done, I'm kind of reminded of that today. Ocarina of Time's Shadow Temple. Yeah, Ocarina of Time's Shadow Temple is weird, it's so linear compared to the rest. It's funny that this counts as Nintendo music. I guess that makes sense. That would be smart, wouldn't it? Oh no, I didn't name the animation. And that breaks things. I may clean. Fuck, that did not work. Okay, let's figure out what's wrong here. Hmm. Um. Hmm. I don't think this is weird. What the fuck? Is the format of the animation wrong somehow? Let's delete this. Good. This again. Make clean, and maybe now it works. Okay, this Manta's going to be simple. It's just going to sit here. Um, Sparkle on the lake for Mario. Uh. For Mario to ride in cutscene, sunset, warp. That's all we need. Yeah, okay, something broke about the animation converter. Great. Great. What the fuck is non-type? I did not edit the animation converter, so this is very concerning. Is this different from other animations somehow? Why does it say 1128 up here? It just says this. What? Why does it export the 1128 here? Hello, Vsavory. Welcome to troubleshooting someone else's tool. Well, I've never programmed a Python mini, so let's see if I can figure this out. Something's wrong with this. No idea what the .group comment does. Maybe it's the name of the animation that's a problem. What if I name it like this? Delete all this nonsense, export again, see if that works. I think it was the name of the animation. Okay, so we found a new limitation of author's tool. You cannot put the name of the actor into the name of the animation. Hello, Sotor. Hello, Zelda. Let's try and use this cutscene. Hello, I'm your cat. Hello, I'm your cat. Hello, I'm your cat. There's still a little animation here. Let's increase the SL. I don't know what. Fuck it, that will look better. Next, we need to place them down and set up the part ID. I think it's going to be around here. What's a good one by the way? What's this? I don't think we are using these yet, I would hope. Okay, looks like we're not using them yet. Hello, crazy Dave. This should all be fine. I'm not sure if the cutscene is going to look correct for now, but that is fine. It doesn't matter, it doesn't need to be 100% correct. 5 DE and EE for the death warps. Oh my god, what happened with the warps here? We don't need that many. I must have covered a really, really stacked level. Row goes to grounds, 5 DE. Does the game have cats? So far I don't think we have a cat. I know it's sad and I like cats a lot too, but it just doesn't seem very fitting. I should work on my Mario 64 AI again. It was a fun product and now that we have BVH collision, we should be able to make the AI much faster in training. That's not what I wanted. Actually, this is fine. Hey, it works! Does this work? He's not solid. Okay, what went wrong? 8023FA, I can ride Manta. Oh, because we're looking for this object. You know what? We're just not using this act. We're using act, multiple, and action arc. Which one is it? Action state. And a riding show. Then everywhere else we just copy. Actually, we can just put it here. Mario state. There should just be x, then y and z, and I think y needs an offset of 25. Do we have an offset here that we can copy? Velocity, timer. Oh, he's 7.5. Okay, we need to make this into fine. Alright, now we should have something going on. That's completely illegal. Even if I was in the business of doing illegal things, that would be a crazy question to ask me. I'm going to a bank robber and ask him, are you going to rob any banks in the future? Any banks we should be looking out for? It seems like it needs some files that are based on decom. Am I missing something? I don't know which files it would need. If it needs some, I don't know. Whatever you get when you compile it. Oh, thank you for the 4 month subscription. Very lucky that I didn't miss that. Okay, it's not illegal for me to produce the cartridge, but it is illegal for me to sell the cartridge. So, unless you want me to give every viewer $50 worth of metal, I can't do it. Okay, this didn't work at all. Not even close. Probably because this is not working. Okay, why not. Can I just do this? Ask for donations and you get a free cartridge included? That sounds just as illegal. Ah, you're right. I should just rob a bank and then use all the money I steal to give the guys cartridges. Okay. Close. Close to what I want. There's no necessary assets like vines from Jurassic Jungle, which code was in the decom despite not being used. Vines from Jurassic Jungle? That's not part of decom. Jurassic Jungle is part of RTYI. But I also don't see how the assets would be missing. Maybe you have a different compiler and your compiler is more strict than mine or something. Just delete the thing causing the warning, I guess. Make a pulse request. Purge request. Alright, this is the new level I made off stream with a lot of help from Eiza. Eiza did most of the graphics here. I just kinda made it playable. I mean, some of the music. Yes, there are a lot of cryptaxes. And then these still missing their sleeping animation. It seems to mostly work. I did not take Mark of Samurai Sunshine, though. We had to compose those musics, me and Zeyna. We kinda did it in the song composing program that I have. It's the sound from Paper Mario, with Zeyna's voice going la. You like the level? That's good. One change I wanna make on that is... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Okay, that's almost perfect. Except, this was turned around. What kind of... What? That's... That sounds like such a brain rotting thing, Ronald. Get off. Where's this coming from? All these seem just freely made up, everything he just said. Hmm, the hitbox radius didn't get smaller like intended. The one issue here... How come? It's my friend, usually. I set it to 300. And because... This is wrong. Got it. We also don't need this. Okay, nice. Hello, Askel. Hey, back to normal. I hate not knowing what to do. But this is important. I think you should spend almost 50% of the time making a video game not having any idea what the fuck you're supposed to do. Okay let's just say we do a big crap instead of a pirate ship. Which, actually I kind of prefer that, because we already have a pirate ship, the ghost pirate ship. So, two pirate ships, kind of lame, no? Alright, big crap comes on land. Big crap's hanging out here. What's it doing? It wants something. Maybe if we have the fish here, it wants to catch the fish. We could combine that with the secret entrance to Marty's level. Wait, okay, wait, wait, wait, bang idea. So we were at Matty's level that was supposed to be here, and we had guys that are talking about how fish know secret ways in the water. What if this was completely closed off with a door first? Not just hidden, but completely closed off. The crap comes by, and the crap tries to eat the fish, like just a giant crap comes walking up the river and starts running after the fish. So Mario has to jump on the crap and like ground pound it, and that makes the crap upset, and it leaves, maybe you get a star, and now the fish... The fish tell you how to enter the secret level. Maybe there's like a secret part of movements you need to do. Maybe... Could be something like walk over here, do a ground pound, walk over here, do a ground pound, and then walk over here, do a ground pound, and that opens the door. But technically you could have done this any time, it's just the fish never told you what to do. Still there's like a secret you find out about around the island, for helping the fish. Here comes one more of the craps on the beach, true actually! Players could use that as a canon explanation for why the giant crap showed up. I think the number one rule for asking me questions about what you should be doing is always give me an end goal, because I think every shit has an end goal, if your shit has no goal attached, then you're asking me like an idealistic question about my personal ethics or how I want the world to be or some shit like that, and that's like not a question I can answer, because I really don't care that much about that stuff. What should be my end goal? See that's a typical question, how would I know that? Now I have to figure out your intrinsic wants. My ambition to be in life is to donate as much money as you can to the stream. Okay, I like the idea with the crab chasing the fish, we would need the fish first though, but that's fine, we can have a giant river crab here, just coming along, trying to snap at the fish, no problem. The one thing we'll need is a secret the fish can communicate to you, Mr. Player. Oh, what if you just have to walk around the temple like three times? That's a cool secret action! That's like Alice in Real Time bullshit. People are gonna be like, yeah, just walk around the temple three times and you'll find the secret level, and people are like, you fucking stupid, you think I will fall for that? Yes, that's a cool idea. What did you miss? We finished an entire side level, and now we're thinking about the next start. Okay, so let's say we do that. So I guess the fish would just be swimming in a circle around the temple then afterwards. How do we tell the player that the fish now like you? Do the fish just talk to you? Did just the swarmer fish and the fish tell you, thank you for helping us? I think that might generally be our best option. No, we need fish and giant crab. I think for fish, we'll just make one fish model and then use textures with patterns that we can UV map onto the fish. I think that would be awesome. Maybe we put like four or five here. Gonna be big fat koi fish. Koi existed in the prehistoric era, right? Surely, or carps. Let's see if I have any fish model I can base it off. Oh, fishing king, that's a goomba. Oh, fish and button iOS that next part is interesting. I'll technically, if I create a fish and giant crab and July's fish model, Fishing king, oh, fishing king, that's a goomba. I remember when I was a kid, I used to make good games, but I've never been good at any games. I mean, yeah, Dun, Dun, Dun seems very useful to learn something from that, right? I don't know. Let's see what fish they have on model resource and if one of these is... Oh, these are all weird. This is genuinely the closest to what I want. Hello, I'm glad you like it. Actually, you have an entire gayfish industries logo. What? This is a nice fish. I like this one. Let's use this as a reference. Making a beefy goldfish here. We need something low poly, somewhat. I'm thinking seven vertices for the main body. I don't know. Why am I modeling both sides? Am I stupid? Oh, I guess I kind of have to, but we can do this at the end. Maybe not. Wait, how did this go wrong? Shit. I don't know. Something like this, I guess. Trick music to walk around mischievously? True. I love walking around mischievously. Oops. Damn. Doesn't quite feel right. I think I might need this extra vertex at the bottom. Oh well. More like a bum this far, maybe. I don't know. I don't know. We can give this a little twist here. And round it out a little bit. Okay, that's much nicer. And does it cost any extra vertices? I think it looks fishy. I kind of want it to be like a fat koi fish. Oh shit, that's very nice. I honestly have no idea how Korea works as a programmer. Is it actually useful to keep interviewing for new jobs? I keep hearing this, but I'm not sure if it's a meme or real. Because it sounds so ridiculous. Hello, calcite lion. Okay. We moved 400% in the last 3 units. Holy shit. That is pretty nice. I haven't even had a job for 4 years. But how does this make sense? Do companies just bang on the fact that you would get comfortable there and not want to disturb your life? Because it doesn't really make sense from the company's perspective, right? Oh, this is 37 triangles, which I guess is quite a bit. And we're still missing some fins here. And the eyes too. Do you remember when you paid the bills when you were the last? No, I do have a job, but I've only had one for like 3 years now. My YouTube earnings do pay a little bit. I think in the last year, my YouTube earnings were around $20,000. Which is decent, but compared to a job as a programmer, that's probably very little. Level 0 programming, we're going to send it this way. And the maze is in a good position, so the more often you choose this position, the higher you're likely to climb. Level 0 programming. What is level 0 programming? I mean, I guess I did actually have the opportunity to get a 30% increase this year. But it was a different job at a company where I wasn't sure if it was going to be a long-term thing. So I just didn't want to do it. I guess I did get comfy. I guess the strategy is working. Oh, I see. I see what you mean. Alright, I think the fat-ass fish is working out. I think it looks great. And then we need... Actually, we need to put eyes on this guy, too. And some fins. And the base material. And the base material is going to be random-ish colors. So that we can use different textures. Or different texture shifts, even. To get different looking fish. I think that will be great. So level 7, which is the highest user level, then we can... Oh. We're done. We're also in each level. We need to get lower. Okay, this looks too abstract for me. I have no idea what you're talking about. Is level 0 like a video game or something? I need to find textures for my fish. A fin texture. I don't think we'll find a fin. The cormorant fins. This might actually be an amazing texture. Will it be too random for the fish to be hue or tone shifted randomly every time you saw them? Yeah, I want them to be the same. It'd be easy to make that happen. But I don't want that to happen. Okay, this texture is not quite what I was looking for. The higher the level, the more replaceable you are. Kind of like Wings in computing. Oh, I see. I see, I see, I see. Yeah, when I hear levels, I think of video games, not computing. I don't know. There was one fish here, actually. That might have what I'm looking for. No, not really. I don't know, Jennifer, but you took a lot of candies. Rare candies. So you have no EV training at all. Your stats are underpowered. I feel like there's a good gutshot you can make by calling someone a level 100 Magikarp. Because they're fully leveled up and can't evolve anymore. There's something here. I don't know. You could call Elon Musk a level 100 Magikarp. He leveled up all the way. He's rich. I don't know if he has any skills. I mean, I just know the Diablo thing he did, which was very funny. He should have butterflies. Um, maybe? I don't really know anything about butterflies. This is a nice fin texture. Hmm. How do I cut this out without fucking everything up? Well, actually, Magikarp learns Tackle at level 15. I guess you could go to the Move Deleter. What's the Move Deleter in this parable? Cocaine? I don't know. I thought it up that you're an ichthyologist and you're comfortable creating fictional fish. I don't need to be officially certified with a degree to feel like I'm comfortable with fish. I don't need to be officially certified with a degree to feel like I'm comfortable with fish. Nonetheless, is it a hot take to say that degrees are overrated? People with degrees will tell you degrees are overrated, but then secretly they'll think like, Oh, I have a degree. I'm actually so much better than you. But like, genuinely, is it a hot take to think that degrees are overrated? I will only take answers serious from people that neither have a degree nor don't have a degree. Because otherwise they're very biased. You have Edio? What's Edio? I see what you mean. What do you say? I did not know that. Oh, shit. That is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, That is very, very helpful. That's going to make my life so much easier. Holy shit. Well, this is going to look rough, I think. But we'll try it. But wouldn't not having an education then mean negative points on your Pokémon card? Isn't that like you're missing the first edition seal? Like there's a crevice in the corner? It's weird to me that HR departments would be so inefficient though. Aren't companies supposed to be efficient? Or is it really just about... I guess they all cooperate in underpaying you if you haven't leveled up enough. I see. That sounds like such a LinkedIn post, but maybe that is what you need. I need a slight bit more down here. We don't actually need to make this grace killing gimp, it's fine. Yes, I mean, sure, but that's not the question, right? The question is, why are they still so inefficient? I don't think they should be more efficient than that. I don't know what to say, I'm not interested in it, so I'll break the fourth wall. That just sounds like LinkedIn jargon to me. It doesn't mean anything to me, but I guess I'm not an HR person, so... I see. I guess it depends on the size of the company, like, the bigger they are, the less efficient they're going to be, right? I don't know. Where do we best put the eyes? It looks like the eyes would be right between these two. Dang, do we need two triangle eyes? That sucks. The fishermen. That's a terribly oversized eye. I think that kind of works. I have a LinkedIn. I also have a LinkedIn, but I just shitpost on it. See, my shitposting spaces always keep getting invaded by people following me. I had to go from Twitter to Beesky to LinkedIn. It's always too many people following me, so I can't shitpost anymore. To tell you, he's 90 degrees. Hmm. I'm going to have to try it. Doesn't work at all. I think we will need the ability to multiply this by a third color. Like so. I'm going to have to go 90 degrees to where they are going to the tail. I'm up for trying it. Let's try it. I have to be in this rotation, right? Maybe kind of this way around. That kind of works. I think maybe this is the way. I'm going to have to go 90 degrees to where they are going to the tail. I'm going to have to go 90 degrees to where they are going to the tail. Yeah, I like it. You don't like it anymore? What? Hmm. And then we can just color this like so. Do you remember that Lumpfish exists? I see. Lumpfish. I think for the combiner for this, we probably want a free color pattern here. Something that can have multiple colors, which actually this definitely shouldn't be this color. This is a valid color. No, actually I take that back. We're going to make a multi texture here. And we're going to use these to make a randomish pattern that we can edit. So let's get a pattern texture going. Something like this. And then we'll have one beside the Lurping, one beside the color, and one beside the orange. Or the gradient. Now that I think about it, do we really need a second texture here? If we want enough random patterns, then I think we do need a very big texture here. A lot of contrast. Something like this. No sound from me. Okay, I do like this. This is going to be for the alpha layer, I think. Then a second for the... Whiteness. This one needs a curve modifier. How do I edit the alpha layer in here? I know how to do it in Photoshop. Layer mask. No, I want this as the alpha channel. Take this, put it here. Why is it floating? Make it the alpha mask, please. There we go. And now let me view the main image again. Let me take a look at the exclamation mark. Hello, Draw and Seeker. Hello. This is not at all what it's supposed to look like. Hmm. I think what I wanted was to multiply these two here. Okay, let's close into what fish look like. Okay. Which is it? Do you have any idea if this will be finished this year? Nope. Probably not. Yes, exactly, Alan. That's the plan. That's why I'm doing this right now. So we can have many different colors of fish. This is honestly the best result we've had so far. That looks terrible. I think the issue might just be that there's too much black in here. If this was mostly one, what would it look like? Still too much black even with that. Alpha layer. How about something like this? Let's add 64 by 64 here and only use one texture. I think that is a good idea. This would be the alpha mask. And this is the color. Makes no sense. It has to be the other way around. This has to be the color and this has to be the alpha mask. Shit, I forgot a layer mask maybe. And then you click on this until hopefully it just starts working. Oh my god, what do I have to do? Edit layer mask, it's on. Enter button. Oh my god, how do I get there? Why is it so hard to switch to this layer mask? I'm gonna lose it. It worked before. I just kept clicking on this until it worked. I guess I'm googling it. Added layer mask. When you click on added layer mask item on the layer mask submenu, it checks a specific text to it. Yes, I've clicked that check. Let me edit it. When I was part of this XO4, not punching my mom or stupid shit like this keeps me up. Adding a mask, okay. Okay, right click add layer mask. How do I edit it? Show layer mask. I had to click on show layer mask. I was allowed to edit it, but I wasn't allowed to see it. Hearing how my stinking mouse is sandwiched between crap that makes no sense is very frustrating. Working with software is the worst, I need computers. This is good, but the color layer is too thick. Do you guys see the idea? Do you guys understand the vision? Do you like it? I'm keezing it, I'm keezing it. Hello Arthur Billy. You like my fish that I made just now? And we cheat this by getting just a slight bit more primitive color. Cool fish, thank you. Oh my god, it overflows right away. That doesn't feel right. Interesting, first 64 renderer has something completely different. Alright, I think we'll do something like that. So now we can make a fish like this, and then we can just move the texture and have a fish like this, and one like this, and one that's mostly orange like this. Isn't that kinda neat? Isn't that neat? Looks honestly kind of sick to you, what? Maybe we need to quantize the alpha a bit more. Rock carp. CSGO pattern fish time, that's exactly the same functionality as... Well these are like, basically koi fish around the temple. I think this might need to be more quantized. Let's try that. Like so. That's so dumb that you have to anchor stuff down again. I will eat whoever made GIMP. I think this just looks like too much. I think this is a bit better. There's an alpha, and the alpha decides how much of the white and black color is shown, and everything with zero alpha is just orange. This is what koi look like, kinda. This is basically the idea. I guess koi have more white. I guess we didn't put enough white here? Like I wanted patterns like these, and this. Alright we got the orange kois, that's good. We have a white one here. Here's one that's mostly black and white. We can have one with an orange face. There's more white here, and also all splotchy. But here the orange isn't splotchy. I think if anything it's like there's too much black here, and that would be the issue. Let's make it more white here. This also makes it a bit more splotchy. I think we got some beautiful fish here. Just black, white, and then the same texture to overlay orange spots over it. You have one texture that's black and white, and then the same texture shifted to overlay the orange spots over it. So, what's the difference from what we have? I can survive in salt water? It's okay, these are prehistoric koi. I know, I have a big goldfish pond. I know a lot about goldfish. But it's okay, these are prehistoric. The orange spots would be spots instead of just solid color fades. Wait, so you have... I don't see how there would be spots. It sounds impossible what you're telling me. Could you have only one color blend to orange? Like the white gets faded to orange and then blend away from the black. So then we get the white equal to orange. The black is orange. There's really no orange. Hmmm. I mean we can absolutely do this though. Or this. When are you going to multiply it with shade? How is the Lerpia different from spots? Yeah wait, only the white gets faded to orange. The black stays where it is. Let me look at Kois again here. That could be possible. We do something like this. Now only the black fades to orange. Oh, that's a nice one. And now only the white fades to orange. But nah, it's not great either. Yeah you can threshold it. Wait. Wait. It's VIA8. That might have fucked up a few things here. Let's see. That looks closer to what they would look like. Although now I can no longer find any white. Ah, ah, here's some white. Found some white in here. It's not bad. Could you spare me some blender to edit each of the fish in the game? We're going to use the set tilesize comments here. The orange is not a texture, that is correct. Oh, you were suggesting there to be a texture with orange spots. I see, I see. I see. That's some orange spots. I mean I guess we'd have to halve the texture size here. But it could work. But these are relatively big fish anyway. I think we just have to be okay with these fish here. Okay. Of course they're still mirrored, which we don't want. Is now determined by half of the texture? Yes. Okay. Oh, that's rough. Okay. We get crazier patterns now. If it's like this. These are not going to be random generated. We can pick out which patterns we like. So we can get a few fish that we like. Hello Samuel. But if you increase contrast and option of the texture, then I think more solid defined patches are going to be absolutely failing. I already have it like way up. This is about as high as you can make it. I mean I guess I can slightly increase it more. Let's try it. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I think this has decent looks. Okay. It's a nice white fish going. Is it so bad? How can I really improve it though? Actually, I have an idea. This might be a good UV map. And then we just mirror the body. This part. And... Huh? Oh, it's the outside vertices. Oh god. Okay. Well, it is seamless. Seam across. No! This is fine. Oh, it's not too pretty. It might be best to just have a seam like along here that's being mirrored. Yeah, let's do that. Okay. This is much less distorted UV map. Okay. Okay. Okay. Which one is this? Huh? What is he just arguing about? I don't know. He stopped paying attention. True. Oh, this is a problem. I guess we can do that. Hey! Boy. He's cool. And along are mirrored, and they're perfectly seamless. How beautiful is that? Through the once-in-a-while special politics stream. Do you remember Marcha? I don't think so. I think it has to be about this size. I could argue to make this smaller. If anything, I'd want this one to be bigger, even. Okay. I think people are talking about Metal Gear Rising over in the YouTube chat. Great game. Okay. Okay. I'm trying to save a bone here. I think we can. You're thinking of Metal Gear Solid. Metal Gear Solid fucking sucks ass. I hate it. Metal Gear Rising is hype, though. Hmm. Wait, no. Oh, maybe... This should work. Okay. Whoa. Wait. This analog is too small. Is it not? Hmm. Okay, nevermind. It's fine here. Depending on the game you make, they both sound like ideas that might work. Oops. Oops. Okay, so this has to be... This arch. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh. They're waiting it. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Hmm. All right. So... Now... We should be good to make... Up some cars for him. Or it. I think I want... Five of these fish. Can Woody Woodpecker escape from Buzz Buzzar's Park? No. Woody Woodpecker escape from Buzz Buzzar's Park? Okay. All right, fine. I'll make the behavior template for it, too. Okay. Hmm. 162. Yes. I do want these two. We don't need them to do anything right now, because we just want to look at the colors. And to make the behavior extern. And then we need one more step, which is to kill the set tile size comments on the textures. Okay. Oh, there's only one. Of course there's only one. Yeah. 252 and 124. Okay. Okay. This is what I want, though. Never mind, there's two. Okay. We actually have a lot more control about it over now than we had in Blender, because we can individually scroll to two different textures here. So now we just need to make up values that look good in-game. Let's just put some random ones here, and keep changing them until we have five fish that we like. Okay. Maybe I would give it a try, but now I haven't played the auto-generated Mark VI, so it already existed either. Okay. Man, you guys start talking about some wild topics. Okay. Um... They all look a little samey to me, which I don't like. Ignoring their animation frames for a second. Ignoring everything that's going on for a second, I don't like how samey they look. For microseconds, it's probably like between 50 and 100. I'm not going to commentate that right now. We might need to write a little fish editor here. I think that's what our player should be. We'll write a little program that lets us edit the fish in real-time, in-game, so we can get the fish looking the way we want. ... ... ... ... ... ... But that will be for a different day. Of course, for today, I'm feeling pretty dumped. So, I will see you guys in the next stream, whenever that may be. Bye-bye! Bye-bye!
