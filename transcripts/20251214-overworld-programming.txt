Hello? Anybody here? Hello, I got Xiaozu. You're gonna get me? Nice. Hello, Riguelma. You didn't want the RLs? Fair enough. Trust me, you don't want it. Hello, Xavaros. Oh, Sage Xiaozu, that's what your name is. Did I get called something else the first time? Is this Xiaozu from Dragon Ball? He's a sage. Right, we were working on this part here. It's like Dragon Ball Z. You know, people keep saying that Xiaozu and Goku never talked in the anime, but I watched a German doc, and they got so close to talking. They were in the same scene, standing next to each other, and they almost talked to each other, but not quite. Wait, what? You're a Dragon Ball fan and you've never heard of that? I guess it just goes to show the bubbles that exist in the internet. I have spent quite a bit of time just re-watching the German dub of Dragon Ball, but I haven't finished yet. And I haven't really watched an episode in two or three weeks, or maybe even longer. But I should watch another one soon. Hello, BabyBroshi. See, okay, I'm the Dragon Ball community's worst enemy, because I think all the power scaling the community does is bullshit. I think it's nonsense. The numbers they give? Nonsense. They have, like, Freeza at, like, 130 million. Fuck that. I think Freeza, at the end, he was, like, 1 million. I did not, Judy. Now, this is supposed to be where the roots of the Super Happy Tree are. In the heart of the island. A crystal-shaped egg between the roots. Spock changes after the second Bowser course, or maybe around 63rd. Bowser's drill suddenly becomes invisible through the wall, and more particles appear as he turns faster. What about Spock giving probabilities? I'm unfamiliar with this one. That's a different kind of thing that I know about. I have never watched Star Trek. I have not watched a single episode of Star Trek. Can you believe it? Yo, Marty. Welcome. Hello, Timmy. Mado or something. Or, like, Wario, maybe. Maybe Wario would be a good name for Mario's rival. Hello, I'm a Nintendo employer. You are a Nintendo employer? You're employing the whole company? Your project is cancelled. No. Okay, I have something that's either the best thing ever or the worst thing ever to show you guys. And it's related to my Analog 3D review. And I don't know if I should put this into the video yet. I don't know if I want to show this to you guys. Maybe we'll do it like a sub-incentive. 10 subs and I'll show it. That's what we'll do. Kirk would, like, inquire into the chance of survival. And Spock, without any relevant data, would say, like, 0.3, 0.7% chance of survival, Captain. Oh, I see. Put the bar up so people know. There's a bar? I figured out the fences you need, and you will use 3D lines for variety. Nice. Let me think, where have we used roots? I think we used some roots in Qwist. Holodom, Bobodom. Oh no, we need 10 subs or $25 donated to reveal this. That's what we'll do. It's related to my Analog 3D review. That's true. I don't know how to put up a bar like that, though. And if I touch OBS, it might crash. Actually, you know what? Let's risk it. How do I put this? Oh, nice, it works. Nice. Okay. Subgoal. Or, well, subs. 10 to 4. Into the reveal. Where are those 10? Oh my god. How's that? I'm the best streamer on the planet. Nice, CinemaStorms. Where are all my combiners? May I see them, please? Okay, well, I guess we're not getting any textures today. That's cool. What is it called? Pumpkin Hill Instrumental. Okay. Wait, shit, one second. Give me one minute. Before I fuck up big. Okay. I was doing a water change on my fish stand, and I just realized I let the water run, and it was going to flood my entire house. Okay. I need some roots coming through here. Okay. I really want you to unwrap a blending gift on Xmas. Oh, that would be cool. Having it done by Christmas would be awesome. Send it to me by Christmas, then we can import the level on Christmas Day or something. Actually, I don't think I can stream on Christmas Day. But maybe on the aftermath of Christmas Day, we can stream it. I get two weeks off after Christmas, so expect a Christmas present from me as well, in the shape of a bunch of streams. Probably not every day, because I do have a family. A lot more than usual. Are you going to make a collision map as well, Marty? I was not expecting you to do that. I will say, I don't really think a collision map is an artist's job. And especially for RTYI, the collision is a little different. If you look... So RTYI has special collision, where you can define a bunch of stuff. You can define a bunch of things. So RTYI has special collision, where you can define a bunch of stuff. You can define the sound the collision makes. You can define the particles. You can define camera settings. You can define properties, like whether it's climbable, whether it's slippery. And then there's just a type. Hello, TunnelsUvoFovoFovoVovo. That's such a furry name. That's such a furry name. Hello, JJ. Fucking JJ902, I can't believe it. The legend himself. Biggest romic so far? How do you count bigness? How do you measure it? Meow. Meow. My daughter has been really into meows recently. Whenever she sees a cat, she goes, Meow, meow, meow. I meow every time you do. There's a worm in my brain, and it keeps pissing me off. I'll put you in a designated row. How are we doing today? Pretty well. I made a really funny thing for the Analog 3D review. And I want to reveal it, but I also don't want to reveal it. And I want to put it in the video, but I also don't want to put it in the video. I made a lot of progress on Course 12. You guys haven't seen Course 12 in a while. Let me just show you what's new. Wait, let's do that again. So first of all, we got a temporary course icon now, you see this? A train, canyon, high noon, in front of a cowboy hat. That is actually the outline. It's colored like the sky here. We got some changes here. Mainly, this level is a lot smaller now. I don't know if you guys remember me making this level, but there was a whole section here with a train station and stuff. That's all gone. Instead, there's some practicality here, and the shortcuts. Over to the Dairy Bar. This is still here. This is a different type of transition now. There's this guy complaining about smugglers. Them cow folks ain't no good. They're cow smugglers running wild. Till we open, ain't nobody leaving town. Right, so I need to be on Act 1 to get through here. You can actually go through here. You can actually go through here. You can actually get past the toad on Act 1 as well. You just need to be a little smart about it. You go this way. You can leave town whenever you want. Yeah, like this. And then here's the outskirts. It's much smaller and cozier than it was before. Before, it was giant, and there were pipes here. Before, it was giant, and there were pipes here. You could go in, and they would carry you around. Now it's actually small. And there's this guy talking about treasure. Wait, I didn't know this is how it worked! That's funny. Cool. The line of dialogue is sliding, and they light up at first. You might be correct. Recently changed a lot about dialogue. This section is a lot smaller now. Those are the main changes. I really like this section now. It's actually fun to move around now. Oh yeah, the thumbnail text. That's so much. That's so much. Do you like that I jumped behind the text? It's 100% unintentional. But I don't know if I should keep it or not. I honestly hadn't thought at all about how they attack before. Holy shit, it just got really cold here. Did they not leave the door to the outside open? Ooh, that's very good to hear, Biobank. Don't worry, even if it performs poorly, I'm sure I can fix it. Okay, wait, I think someone left the door outside open. Sorry, I have to go fix this real quick. This sucks. Okay, maybe not. Maybe I'm just crazy. Bro, unban me, I was choking. Why would I dox? Also, I'm not a transphobe. What? Okay, that's going to help performance a lot. I don't think the tricone is an issue in the level. I think it was all overdraw. So I think you're good. I couldn't read that text. I think I fucked that up, I'm sorry. I fixed the sub alert, but thank you for the sub. I will update the text to reflect that you subscribed. Because I'm a good streamer. Hello, SamMemory. It was you, you watched the sub? Eating blankets for devs, true. Why am I getting my programmer socks? They keep you warm. If you're still doing Water Wednesdays, yes. So, I posted on Twitter a lot. I gathered 5 million views. And Twitter paid me $23. So I deemed it not economically viable to be a Twitter user. That was literally my only motivation for posting on Twitter. The lag end of Zayna? Who's that bozo? Who's that bozo? Zayna, why is it suddenly so cold in my house? I'm freezing. Did you do something? Did you open all the windows upstairs or something? Hello, Zombizzle. You need to teach me how that weird scrolling and slashing hand function works so I can rework it. Are you talking about the material on the housing section? No, Zayna, I think the windows are all open. That's what it feels like. Okay, that one's extremely complicated. Basically, there's a grayscale channel that's all the brightness. And then there's the alpha channel. And the alpha channel has the dimples for the light, where the light won't be reflected. So if you look at the combiner, with that knowledge combined, maybe you can figure out exactly how the math works out. It's very unintuitive, I would say. But the heating is on, and it's super cold. I hear the heating being on. There has to be a window open somewhere. But if it's on A-spread, it's because it's like 2% opacity. I don't know, I didn't open it. Did I? Yes, you did. What? Discord link? Is my Discord hard to find? I honestly don't know where you can find my Discord link. What do you mean, what do I mean? You're saying I'm cold and I don't understand why it's cold in the house. It's usually not cold like this. It's very simple. It's on the profile? Ah, okay. There you go. That's where you can find it. This is actually very concerning, because it's not loading my materials. But I like that you have the same issue with some of my levels. Does it work if I switch to Eevee? My office door is closed. Thanks so much, Pumpkinello, you can thank me. Alright, fine. We've had 20 minutes of Pumpkinello. I think that's enough. Ah, it's bus 64 rendering, that's fucked up. Okay, no, there are windows on the house that are open. Guys, I'm going to go on a wild goose chase for a second. I'll be back in a minute. I am so confused. There are no open windows, I'm just crazy. The 300 rooms in this villa? I wish I was rich, man. You ever thought about what you would do if you could go back to being in 5th grade for a single day? I would just buy Bitcoin. Any OST wishes, then, since we can't listen to Pumpkin Hill for the next two hours? What, a Mario World OST? I did not tell them about the Bitcoin miner parts that we found. But then I did find, like, a bunch of Bitcoin mining equipment on the street and just took it home. And now we have to sell it. It's like RAM and GPU mounts and the CPU. You would buy games that became much harder to obtain nowadays? That's fair. Yo, Zero Vault! Oh, what a Mario World. Oh, I see. I thought you just wanted to say what about Mario World OST but fucked it up or something. I guess that someone always has good stuff on the side of the road. Wait, was it that place again? Was it the same place we got the tank from? Yes! Okay, wow, okay, that's actually insane. We got, like, three different parts from these people, right? So there's one place here that always just has cool stuff they're throwing away, I guess. We should put up a camera there and then, like, check it once a day to see if they threw away anything else. That's great. There we go, sorry. No, they're throwing it away, though! They're just putting it on the curb. Oh, you mean installing the camera is illegal? Yeah, that's probably true. Ah, typical Biobank material with the trim color here that doesn't do anything. I think that's just what the Fast64 preset looks like and that's why this happens. ZeroVault has been importing a lot of songs recently. Let me show you this one. This is one of the coolest things ever. You hear the pause menu sound being used? You hear the steps of Metal Mario being used in this? Well, the problem is that every time we use trim color like that, we lose, like, 0.05 microseconds, so we don't really want that. But that's not even the best part of the song yet. Oops. We can shortcut. We don't need to wait for shit. What?! Oh no! The collision is the wrong way around! I didn't know that! That's an issue. Oh my god, I did it again. That was stupid. Okay, I'll just cheat. Okay, but now is the coolest part of the song. This part here. You hear the alarm? How cool is that, man? It's just part of the song. And then when you shoot away, the alarm is gone again. That's the coolest thing ever now. Wait. When the factory tech named Dungeon uses the sound of a hammer hitting an anvil as it's rhythm. Here's the implementation. Oh, it's pretty simple. I can actually show you. Right here. Okay, we just define a box, we copy the position of the box to the camera, and then we clamp to the box's bounds. And then we just get the distance to the camera and fit the volume appropriately. What do you count as contributing? Because sometimes someone will write a chat message and I'm like, yeah, sounds good. Does that count as a contributor? Because then it's probably in the hundreds of thousands. Views of Bob-ombs look lit when they start chasing Mario. Must be colored orange. Or blue if someone was there. Definitely possible. Yeah, I need the texture to use for the roots. Wanna sing? What's this potential? What's this potential? What's this potential? What's this potential? What's this potential? What's this potential? What's this potential? What's this potential? What's this potential? Okay, we're gonna make graphics, sounds, code optimizations. So, sounds is basically all Badoop and ZeroVault. There's also a song made by Sauron, which is the song at the end for the 8-bit section. Very cool song. Optimizations... I mean, there were a lot of people that contributed ideas to optimizations, sometimes with YouTube commenters. There were... Kazana made some of them. It's a little tough to answer who contributed to that, really. There was some of Aglab's stuff that I used. There's a lot of stuff from the Omri community I use. Of course, Sauron also added a huge deal of optimization with FBDX3. So, ZeroVault, the daisies... Oh, the daisies. Sure, I can do that. And then assets is mostly me at Biobank. Zena's making some as well. This is also a level that interacts with the music a fair bit. Oh yeah, this level is mostly made by Eiza. As in, the assets were made by Eiza, and they put them together in a level that works. And of course, Zena is doing most of the animations for NPCs, and PixelPolaro is also helping with those. He did most of the Mario animations, and I think he also did some NPCs. Why is no one talking to Trump about the invisible Warbuck? There's probably a joke here that makes sense in your mind. Yeah, Zena helped me with the music. I don't know notes, so I'm just sitting there like, oh, does this sound like a 42 to you, or like a 41? See, I have a program that lets me compose in Mario 64, like inside Mario 64. Just code that lets me do that, so we use that to compose. You don't speak in actual music terms either. Don't fool yourself. You don't know music terms better than me. You could use a piano keyboard. Yeah, that doesn't help me. You can hear notes better than me, but that doesn't mean you know the music words better than me. It's like completely different things. I'll let you know, I got like peak grades in music class. I haven't been for five years, so... What about it? You can't play music. Doesn't really have anything to do with knowing music terms, right? Is this Jewish? What? What is it? Well, okay, I don't know what kind of music class you went to. German high school is very different from, like, American one. But in the music class we had, it was like about reading notes, basically. So, and like knowing music terms. So it's not like you had to have any musical talent to get good grades in music class. You just needed to have theoretical knowledge a little bit. And obviously I'd be good at theoretical stuff. The root of all evil here? No, this is the root of the super happy tree. This is the root of all happy. The opposite of that. And we're gonna put the heart of the island here, which is going to be a crystal Yoshi egg. Can you still use Photoshop? Nope. Reminder, we have a sub goal incentive, 10 subs, and I will reveal... Maybe I should remind people, if they don't want to reveal it. You need to grab a Yoshi egg from a different level. Made a lot of mods for Maximony, don't feel ashamed for some of them. Don't know the implication of that. Yeah, you made a lot of really stupid garbage, didn't you guys? Is that what you're asking? We had to read notes sometimes, but that was not the main thing. Well, I think it depends on the kind of school you go to. In Germany there are three different types of schools. There's like... How do you say this in a politically correct manner? There's a school for people that are most likely to get into manual labor. And then there's a school for people of all kinds of walks of life. And then there's the school for the children that have an easy time at school. And I was at the last one, and there you would do more theoretical stuff. You also went to gymnasium? No idea what that is in English. Oh, okay. Okay. Nevermind then. Wait, so what did you do in music class, if not theoretical stuff? Were you just singing songs? That's all goofy as hell. Okay. Oh, that's completely different. What's that in gymnasium? That's... Basically in Germany there are those three types of schools. And when they notice, hey, this kid is kind of smart, then they send you to that school. Which is like, around a third of the population goes there. So it's not like anything super special to go there. You weren't born like me. Stereo was playing music itself, and we had to learn music theory. That's surprising that you'd learn music theory in Bernstein. I thought you'd just learn to play the instrument. Okay. Okay, I want this to look like a crystal. And I would like this to look like red to pink. So what if we do something like... Primitive color plus texture 0 color. Texture 0 color multiplied by 1. Or maybe even texture 0 multiplied by primitive color alpha. Just to get a little bit more detail here. And map plus Fresnel. Right, Fresnel. We need that too. I actually never really used it before. Let's learn to set it up today. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see. Fresnel to alpha. Is that what this is? Do you need fog turned on for that? So this goes into shade color alpha. So I guess we also want to lerp to pink on the edges. Okay. And I'll excel. Primitive color plus... Which is going to stun a little bit. Excel. I'm not sure about Fresnel here. Maybe like so. The only sports game I ever played seriously was Mario Strikers Chess Football. It's white towards the edges. Is that not what you want? Or what you wanted? Excel. Honestly, Shade Smooth just looks so much nicer. I like the power in Smooth Shade. That's amazing. I think Fresnel might just not look good with flat shading. Maybe I should change it to true. Yeah, I'm not sold on Fresnel. I think I prefer it without. If you want to try to improve this and add Fresnel, you're free to do so. But I think this is what I want for now. Let's check if the level is enterable as it should be. Let's see. Bro, I can't believe my subscriber bait isn't working. I thought by now we'd have filled it. I guess you guys really don't want to see it. That's too bad. Oh, that looks cool, Biobank. That looks awesome. I will show it on stream real quick. As soon as VLC opens up. What the fuck? How did that close? There we go. Yeah, that's awesome. Do you use the alpha channel to decide how much of the prim color it adds? Yes. We can try that real quick, actually. Fuck it, let's make that part of this right away. Yeah, that does look awesome. Gonna export any second now. And you also have a PC port of your current in-development project? Where are you getting this from? Who's saying these things? Someone must have trolled you. I have nothing to do with a PC port. There might be a static recompilation, which is kind of like a PC port. But I have not started development on that. And that would just be a thing Wiseguy does. It's not like a thing that's in active development ever. Am I stupid? No. While we're here, let's make sure that this wall works. It works. Awesome. I guess once the egg works, we're basically done with part 6 already. Didn't even take an hour of one stream. Told you the Wizen yet. Oh, fair enough. I've dreamt it. Can you imagine a society where I've dreamt it as a valid piece of evidence? Here, let's make this playthrough moopin'. You should ask the moopin' developers if they can eventually make my hack playable. I think RetroArch works on N64 emulators on Android though, so... Why not just use that? I don't know. That is the heart of the island. And it's not scrolling like I thought it should. Cool. I don't know why it's not scrolling. Meme review? One of Rionu's memes? Meme review for Rionu? Rionu? Oh, he sent this to me before he posted it. I know this one, but we'll review it anyway. A water bug. It's been a week, man! So many people are in the crystal for like a century, okay? You're going in, a minute is gonna feel like a week. So you have some time to think about what you've done and you're gonna come out of the crystal. And then Analog comes around and releases a new one. What's that hack? No, that's just part of our greenhive time. If you want to unlock that, you need to... you know when you get the light arrows? If instead of a normal arrow, you shoot an ice arrow, you get that cutscene at the end. Okay, this part changes after the second bowser course, so maybe around 60 stars. Bowser's drill slowly becomes more visible through the wall. And more particles, and it turns faster. Okay, I don't want to do that one yet. But basically you're just going to be Bowser's vehicle here. I think there will be speedruns of this game, but not as many as in the original. Part 7 is Lighthouse. We did the Lighthouse already, right? Let me just clarify. If there's anything we need to do left... Okay, it's looking rough. But it is here, technically. I don't know if it makes any sense for me to spend any time polishing this up, given that Biobank is probably going to be like, yeah, this all sucks anyway. Okay. That's going to look so cool at the end. I'll just save the game. I'm going to save that the level is unlocked. Nth color in my weird Nth material? I thought it was illegal. Where do you see Nth color? There's no Nth color. Is there anything more I think? Oh, it was required. And yes, there is some extra work in making it work, but it is technically possible. But it should definitely be avoided if possible. It should definitely be avoided if possible. Are you going to just read your project? Well, like all my other ROMAX where I just make a patch. Part 8, Broken Castles. Yes, I have an Analog 3D and I finished my review of it. And if we get 10 subs, you guys can get an early sneak peek of my review of the Analog 3D in the shape of something funny. That I'm not sure I'm going to put in the video yet. I have the white one. I have the black one. I have the black one. The incentive was never free. Big N is watching me. Yeah, they're fanarts of my channel, I think. Yeah, they're fanarts of my channel, I think. I've been animate how it goes pretty well. I'm making good progress still. I've been animate how it goes pretty well. I'm making good progress still. How many characters are left to be reworked? Or are you just polishing the world at this point? Well, the reworking stuff happens in parallel. And Biobank is doing it. And you can look at the milestone tracker here. Any second now. As soon as it loads. Oh no, my computer is going to crash, isn't it? Was this a mistake? I have no idea what she's talking about. I have no idea what she's talking about. I have no idea what she's talking about. I have no idea what she's talking about. I always do, I'm boring. Why would it crash? I don't know, ask Bill Gates. Yep, it's definitely below freezing. Yep, it's definitely below freezing. My pond outside is all frozen over. Well, there ought to be a milestone tracker, but evidently fucking not. And now this is... And now this is... everything's fucked. And now this is... everything's fucked. No, I'm not planning anything. I release it when it's done, and you need to leave me alone. Music is still... Music is still... what a Mario world. Music is still... what a Mario world. What's happening? I'm being badged up by questions from chat while I'm working on my ROMAC. I think there might be a level issue I think there might be a level issue with course 7 where it crashes currently. Yes, I will release it when it's ready, and you cannot change that fact. Sorry, I'm not pissed at you specifically, I'm just annoyed at getting the same question over and over. I'm not pissed at you specifically, I'm just annoyed at getting the same question over and over. Can I add the link to the tracker? No idea, but it is on the case clip's channel description. I feel like I've heard this song on a ROMAC before. I feel like I've heard this song on a ROMAC before. It's pretty fucked up for some reason, the frame rate sometimes drops to 10-15, so I click on the taskbar and there's nothing in the graphics. Sounds about right. Sounds about right. I didn't mention that Chlorobite or Obby I didn't mention that Chlorobite or Obby would come in on your names made on your about 12th anniversary months, knowing all the crazy shit you've done for some nice communities. Anyway, there's a second B3B1 drama that happened like 2 months ago. Okay, wait. He's active in niche dramas, but also he somehow caused something related to B3B3 drama to happen? Is he part of the B3B3 community Is he part of the B3B3 community or did he just play B3B1 3 or did he just play B3B1 3 and then people got upset at it or something? Is he like actually famous or is he just... BetaKidFamous, you know what I mean? It is so funny how much B333131 has. It's just so fitting. It's like for years, everyone's like, yeah, only little small children care about the beta recreation. And then as soon as there's like beta content, it's all just small children having beef with each other. Is your on-programming experience useful for modern game development? Yes. I mean, pretty much every skill you can learn is kind of useful for every other skill you can learn, if you think about it. You could ask me, was your Super Smash Bros. Melee experience useful for your programming experience? Then I would have to say yes. Who is the guy who modeled Purple Castle Sewer Room 7 and 8 from B333131? How do you not know them? The guy who modeled Purple Castle Sewer Room 7 and 8? No! How could I forget about him? I swear, I could have named you. I could have told you who did Purple Castle Sewer Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9, but 7 and 8? I forgot about them. I'm so sorry. I'm the worst B333131 you've ever seen. MISSING WARP! Couldn't they not have picked a better name for B333131 that's shorter? I don't want to say this all over. It's such a long word. It sucks to say. You know like Oily Boily Bay is super fun to say? They need that. Pronounced it B-E? B-E! That makes sense, honestly. Yeah, it's Leetspeak for B-E. Yes! Probably someone, Kevin. Even the community sent an asterisk, someone managed to get in an annoying drama but ended up being forced to remove beta content? Can't say B3- No, B-E is better. B-E! I might piss some people off as well, which is kind of a bonus point. Right? Okay, the world works. We should probably have a safe block somewhere here. And this needs to be like a door? I don't know what I was thinking, making it look like that. The 9th bit is not upcycled. I don't know where you're getting this from. The camera angle was indeed weird. Luckily, you can just control the camera angle with B-Pan 1. You cannot bounce on the fish now. If there was a point where we reworked the engine so it would be able to use and it starts porting numerous engines to every console with a homebrew port, that would be cool. What's the A3D meme reveal? Well, you have to gift 9 subs to find out, honestly. There's nothing else you can do, because I'm not telling anyone. Let me just put a big fat metal door here. What's up, chat? Hello, Bufna. Fun fact, the 9th bit on the Analog 3D does not work correctly. So if you try to use the 9th bit on the CPU on the Analog 3D, it's just going to not do anything. I used a RetroBlast to clean Teemo up. You said programming anything for the first time. Did you learn from school to do so or learn somewhere how it works and how to do it? The first time I programmed was in math class on my calculator. It had the TI-84 basic language on it and you could just start programming. Eventually, my math teacher told me how to do it properly and he showed me a few tricks. Yeah, writing or reading there does not work. Well, one of the two doesn't work. That means that there's 8 million bits that the CPU can't view. Let's just temporarily... I'll be honest, I give so little of a fuck that whatever you just said, I have already deleted it from my brain. I'll be honest, I give so little of a fuck that whatever you just said, I have already deleted it from my brain. What the fuck are you trying to achieve? What was this originally? Remember us on the Analog 3D? I got through the first level, then it crashed. Well, that's probably not the Analog's fault. The early ROMics were not necessarily N64 compatible. I'll send back the Unreal N64, that would be no issue. I mean, Zaina, if you want to pay me to do it, that will be $120,000. Actually, maybe $150,000 is more fair. You are working on a project as a hobby, not getting paid after writing that shit? I have no idea what you're talking about, but... I assume more known ones don't bother. I think, maybe, if you're lucky, Aorus does it, but I'm not sure. But this seems like very easy to emulate behavior. So I'm sure they could just add it to Aorus. And 80k so you can make the models better? Yep, 200k, last impact on the N64, decent framerate with firebacks and visuals. Honestly, that would be a great project. Are we allowed to fix the design too, or do you just want the game as is? Here it is without the 0.5, it doesn't go quite as far as it does... You haven't even shown me what the base code is! What the fuck? So it was originally set to get spinner right move time, no dividing by delta time. NO DIVIDED BY DELTA TIME?! So like, it was just 60 times as fast? What are you doing? Why would you just multiply it by 60? What's your favorite milkshake flavor? Chocolate. You can't just find a bug and then do random shit to it until the bug disappears. That's how you get more bugs. Then we don't understand why you have all these bugs. 51 lifelength 0.13 . avoir lag HoN is not a teamport, this game to be a stitch while I have lag alone In fact npcs probably game shitty accrops everytime of as, seriously? Oh I mean if you had shown me a before and after this probably would have been easier But if the before didn't even have delta time you're just multiplying by 60 are you not? Right move time, you get spin on right move time Okay well then, yeah there's not enough information to properly scale this There's probably a lot of other stuff that this M right move time is used for Where you should be correcting for the framerate Nice auto-deduct Didn't think it'd be so easy Okay The watchable romhacks would be sick They have that, I think they have the romhack awards Yeah but then that sounds like you should fix it But you can't just do random things, you have to do things that actually make sense You have to look at the code and analyze why it's going wrong and then figure it out from there If the delta time macro just scales right through then maybe that makes sense Maybe that's not just the right time, maybe that's the right time and amount of frames Then maybe that makes sense if the frame counter is like a separate thing But I wouldn't know these things because I don't know the codebase So progress sheet, it is in the channel about me section I don't think more content is necessarily better I played the original Sonic Robo Blast up until this shitty fucking Eggman level And it was pretty fun, but I think that was enough Has the update removed the Nights levels? I hated the Nights levels I just kind of kept flying in a circle until it was over because I didn't want to be in them Can we use Blender with the 3DMark software like Maya? It works, that's like the main reason Let's go! Honestly, this jump is a little too awkward for the cab level Wait, why do I die if I leave the level? Why do I die if I leave? Course 7, I shouldn't be dying MST swaps up? It must have I should look at the course and see what I actually wrote down here Hello spindraw? I don't know what to say I can't listen to this anymore, oh my god Any of us T-Wishers? That is not the song over and over again This is going well Paper Mario TTYD? Let's do it Oh, what the fuck? I actually have to twist it around Hello Clayman, hello Maradona What kinds of games do I play in my free time? Honestly, all kinds I like to play games that I haven't played before Make new experiences Widen my horizon Experience culture What's my game of the year? What is the best game I played this year? What games have I played this year? I played Hitman Blood Money I played Pokemon Stadium I played GTA San Andreas That's the worst game of the year for me What else? I think I played Party House in UFO 50 Party House is pretty high up I have not played Donkey Kong Bonanza You had a blast with San Andreas? Really? The game is complete ass for me It's so tedious just driving around and stuff I imagine the game is fun if you're not trying to make any progress But if you're actually trying to play the game, it's horrendous What other games have I played this year? Not very many I found out choosing Blender outside of Organ Mountain I've been introduced to 3D Modeling through YouTube There is Blender.nfc and my aunt is going to know it I'm looking for playtesters for your games I'd be happy to help Also can't wait for your next game And maybe remaster of Star Road I am always looking for playtesters I'm not hiring in the sense that I'm paying anyone But yes, I'm looking for playtesters A remaster of Star Road is still possible someday in the future But I will not guarantee anything You can even get a list of everything you've done each day of the year And a list of all things you've watched and played Amateur, do you? You can't kick Bob-ombs anymore, that's a bit of an issue The problem with RTY I playtest is that I do not want any risk of it being leaked So I try to only pick people as playtesters that I have known for a longer time You can't just make that up, there's no way for me to verify that Is this genuine or do you just make shit up? Because that's impressive if it's real No, right now the playtesters I'm looking for are all just for gameplay testing and making sure the game's fun Can you actually do this? That's crazy I imagine that has some benefits though For purposes of recalling, to remember what you did during the day And to draw conclusions about yourself based on that And about what you want to do in your life Very big autism energy though But I feel like you need to actually go into this conversation Okay, so we want the thwomp here, and he's going to be blocking your path Known you forever, you just don't know me? Yeah It is kind of weird to think about how many people actually know me I took 331 showers this year and watched 27 movies and ate noodles 59 times 331 showers this year That's 19 days left in the year This adds to 350 That means there's at least 15 days More if you shower twice than at least one day At least 15 days you didn't shower I have not played pseudo-regalia I like to play games with two hands That looks more like a one-handed game, you know what I mean? I use Windows 11 The radio GTA is very funny I should think of a way to make this jump easier So you have to get in here to find the cow level And it's kind of nice that this is like a secret But also the jump just feels too weird I'd like it if you could jump into here without this feeling so weird of a jump Also there should be smoke coming out of here I don't know 10 showers so far this year, nice Good job You can add a move or a throw, Half-Life style To make the roof a little higher How does it fix it? You have to explode something to tease the cap level That kind of works And there's bombs all around, but they don't respawn anymore I don't care that GTA pushes the console The game is dogshit You just drive somewhere And then there's a bullshit mission Where one of your stupid NPCs that follows you He fucking dies And then it's like, mission failed Drive back to where the mission starts for 5 minutes And then drive back to where the mission is for 5 minutes And guess what? The fucking idiot that came with you Now he dies 10 seconds later Good luck, do it again Drive back for 5 minutes Oh wait, my hour is over And I need to save the game So I'm gonna drive to my house For another 10 minutes To save the fucking game No thank you I'm interested in the bomb guy's attack Why didn't Mark6 do it? It looks funny That's pretty cool in your boy Well you can't really measure thickness that easily I'm percent But based on vibes I would say 2 to 4 times Somewhere in that range You jump across from the placed box Like I could put a box here and then you jump Yes So just pointing out this thing about the game I actually don't really care about your opinion on the game Fair enough We need to do that more We need to tell people, like I really don't care about your opinion That needs to be more acceptable But when I tell it to people, they get really mad at me It's like, yeah bro, I can't change the fact I don't care what you want me to do Do you want to keep living in your dream world Where everything is nice? Well tough luck, liberal I don't care I don't care Well tough luck, liberal I don't care about your opinion Oh Yeah I like that idea, yes So If we had a switch here With a fuse, and the fuse maybe went along Here, here, here, here Up here And then up here And follow along here And then there's something here that blows up Fair enough, Ekta I kind of agree Yes, this is playable in 4-3 You can just Not turn widescreen mode on And now it's 4-3, but my emulator Viewport is stretched, so it doesn't look like it Yeah What would be the yellow paint For jumping down the chimney Well, we would put something else Other than a chimney to get here I'm thinking of what it would be I kind of question, does it have to be a fuse It can be any other time-based mechanic God, I hope they make Another good Paper Mario soon Yeah, the fuse is good, because it's Bomba Jason I'm just A trapdoor that opens for a second I don't know how clear that would be And how Sense it makes I didn't play the TTYD remake, I already played TTYD TTYD is 60fps Why would I want to play a 30fps remake That basically looks the same to me Tell me Origami King is great But No I need to put it in a different way It is very skillfully made, but It's still not fun Because they decided to go for Zero extrinsic motivation And there's a bunch of stupid fucking fights That are not endurable unless there's Extrinsic motivation It's like playing Mario 64 blindfolded Like if you play Mario 64 blindfolded And you get a star, it's like Wow, awesome, you got a star, that's fucking cool But like Take the fucking blindfold off And maybe you can actually beat the game That's how I feel about Origami King Minshuriken Minehalder Is blown over 90 degrees and then Falls back down Wow Yes I like that I finished Origami King But it's not a very fun game It's a good game, it's just not very fun Just the fighting that sucks balls Okay, so what if we connect this To the chimney And the chimney just looks out of here And there is like a metal plate here And the smoke is coming all out Out of all the sides And the fuse goes all the way in And when the fuse touches it, it goes boom And it flies into the sky And you get like a 2 or 3 second window Where you can just walk in Now the one worry I have for that is What if you stand on the platform Maybe that's actually not a good idea What do you mean by extrinsic motivation as in a challenge? No Extrinsic motivation? Okay, think about Pokemon The gameplay of fighting wild Pokemon Is objectively lame as fuck And the gameplay of fighting most trainers Is objectively lame as fuck You basically just smash the A button With zero thought But this is tolerable Because you get EXP from that And your Pokemon gets stronger So it feels like there is a purpose To what you are doing It feels like this is getting you somewhere This is... The value of what you get In those games is directly proportional To the amount of time you put in So... It's not a full waste of time Because it creates The sense of value But in Origami King It just wastes your time to fight It doesn't create any sense of value It just wastes your time Make the manual cover Slippery or spiky? Oh yeah, that's a good idea Oh, but you could Still stand on it For just a second This is why you never had fun With Battletoads or post-game things in Pokemon Yeah I think a lot of early gamers forget this Sometimes the boring parts Only work once you've added the rest of the game Yeah Well, it's not about people instinctively Knowing to avoid it It's about people purposefully getting on here And then getting blasted into the sky I want to avoid that, please Okay, let's do that I think the cover So... Coming out from all sides Like the cover Okay There is a fuse here That starts going from the switch You press the switch Place against the fuse There is a... Cuboid cover On top It goes up from the fuse It spins 180 degrees Then it's back If Mario ever Stands on this cover He is flying back Like from a Seashell And... Resets So... This is what we'll do But if there is a reason to stand on the cover It seems like an easier route than trying to prevent it Nah, we just blow the player back, it's fine I see that I find a tiny bit of interest In Metal Toss, that is the fact that you can buy 7 rare items only there, instead of with the Pokemon Yeah, that is a huge grind Alright, let's do it Starts on the flip idea That's what I wrote down, yes We do the flip And then it throws you back like a heatho Ah Oh So you have to stand on top of the platform Before the thing explodes, nope You don't stand on top If you stand on top, you just get blown back It is literally just better To not stand on top There is nothing more to it Than that I can't believe it took me this long To make a generic floor switch I was searching for this channel Since I had you say it in the other video That's a long ass time to be searching for this I don't think a perfect game exists There are a lot of games that I like though There are around Some of my favourite types of games Just have a habit of dying You ran platform up and there was a Monomia And you rocked your last attack And then crashed the game What do you think? I don't know The shareholders will love this one You know what, the switch should be here This is a nice place for the switch to be Also I can't believe Really no one gives a fuck about the analogue 3D thing Alright, that's it It's revoked You guys are not getting the analogue 3D meme I'm insulted 67 stars Mario does the 67 dance And everyone at school stops making fun of you Can we also do one for 69 stars? Can we wait until every number became funny So we can make a specific animation for each number What's the meme? I don't know Who knows? I'm not upset I'm upset and you are Nice Then we only need 100 more funny now And we can make the game finally Thanks for watching Now it's just the framerate issues and all can be removed The Oak written in the 58em and back front Sho'a Well, now I bet you guys wish you had asked what it was Too bad Tenacity of you to punish the viewers for being poor Now you're guilt tripping me Like I'm guilt tripping you Just like the analogue thing Okay, I think we just want to move this over here Like so maybe And then move these things over here And then we can maybe move the whole tower Like so That's kinda nice Has anyone seen Paywall a meme? Okay, I mean Okay, the thing is it is extremely cringe So I kind of don't want to show this It's more than a meme, there is way too much effort into this Oh my god You're trying to guilt trip it out of me? Yeah The reason to hi for this meme you have to show it to us Or the video will go poorly due to immense disappointment I'm still thinking about maybe putting it in the video I don't know what to do Let me think about this How do I best handle this from here? What if I tell you guys what it is But then I don't show it I think that's a fair compromise We don't get paid to sell us the analog 3D? I do not Alright, I'll tell you guys what it is It is an analog 3D disc, right? Why don't you have your next stream be a camera of you working and no view of your screen? Wait, what? Why would that be a thing? I don't get it Exactly case? Wait, what do you mean exactly case? What did I do this time? What the fuck? What's up with your YouTube chat? Yes, I have an analog 3D And I have thrown a bunch of tests at it To check if the stuff they're saying about it is true A lot of the stuff is not true That's why we have to make the analog 3D disc, right? In the goal analog 3D disc reveal, you would have had double the goal right now? Probably But I didn't want to say what it was Now in the district I explicitly asked to not be refunded I asked for something else That's just thinking out of music. That was like two minutes long That's just thinking out of music. That was like two minutes long Similar analog 3D consoles coming in the future, would you review them all? Maybe I mean I guess that depends on how well the first video does Yeah, I had to remodel the whole building For this to work I don't give a fuck about the sports stuff Who cares about these things? What? It's so weird to me that some people are out there watching another man play sports And then they cheer for it Isn't there like an alpha male podcast that tells you not to do that? I'm sure there is I will let those speak for me It has to be something like Being a fan of sports is the most astrogen-fueled activity on the planet Because you're basically cocking yourself If that is what makes people stop talking about sports to me, then that is the opinion I will adopt I guess I should get into watching sports Had a rain match Oh so you watch 22 guys running after a ball? That's what you like to do in your free time? Isn't this just nicer? The answer is yes, it is We fixed the building So now you can actually get up here after the explosion I don't see the problem with sports if you like video games I don't even understand your angle to begin answering your question Or your sentence How are those related? John Cena is still wrestling? That's crazy Even after the whole John China drama? That's crazy He gave up wrestling and now he's just being chillin You know what I mean? Even after being pluribust, the man keeps fighting John Cena got pluribust? Is that what it means to get pluribust? To get ostracized from society? I thought when people said that someone was getting pluribust, they meant they became part of the hive mind As in they just took over the opinion that is currently prevailing on Twitter and the social climate I haven't watched the last few episodes it seems The last episode I watched was HDP Oh, I think I'm one episode behind then, right? I'm not jumping on the newest episode as soon as I see it But I thought I was up to date HDP had John Cena in it? Right, he was in it I forgot, I didn't even register it Yes, John Cena was in the episode I didn't register it because obviously in-universe it is not John Cena So to me it was like, oh yeah that's not John Cena, that's just the hive mind I was just too immersed to realize that I'm talking to John Cena right now In-universe it is John Cena, it's John Cena's body But he himself wasn't there, it was just the hive mind I don't know In-universe it is John Cena, it's John Cena's body But he himself wasn't there, it was just the hive mind I don't know In-universe it is John Cena, it's John Cena's body I don't know So we're just pretending that my pretend opinion is my real one? What am I passionate about? That's a tough question Pop-culture wise I guess I'm passionate about the next part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure That's one thing I'll watch I guess I'm passionate about the next part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure I guess I'm passionate about the next part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure I guess I'm passionate about the next part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Because I know that was my pretend opinion You know what though? That probably happened at least once a while back And you know it, you know this kept happening People had racism as their pretend opinion and got cancelled for it That was my rage-bait-sona You idiot, you're talking to my rage-bait-sona I know I'm not racist, I just know I'm a pervert I know I'm not racist, I just know I'm a pervert I know I'm not racist, I just know I'm a pervert I know I'm not racist, I just know I'm a pervert People genuinely do have rage-bait-sonas though Like on Twitter there's a lot of people that are just making money off rage-bait They have rage-bait-sonas I don't know No, no, no, not parody accounts, full-on rage-bait-sonas They're just pretending to be real and then they're just rage-baiting people It is happening a lot on Twitter Every time I go on Twitter and I see a post, it's like this post isn't real Nothing on there is real It's all just people roleplaying Are you letting Reina type? You know what, I think the baby has been starting to dupe me I used to think she really likes the lawnmower, but recently I've noticed She has to go see the lawnmower, but then she doesn't even play with the lawnmower I think she just wants me to carry her downstairs She can play downstairs, but the lawnmower is... Is Carrie baiting you? She is Bit of an interaction for this one I'm gonna do an interaction for this one But I want it to be slightly above ground on some places Or, hmm I mean, I guess I can flatten the middle out if I wanted to I just felt it'd be easier this way I guess otherwise we might have so much Z-fighting here Like right here, to get the Z-fighting not to be there Would be awful If you have something roguelike She's thinking like black powder I don't think it's too bad Yeah, creamed cement, it depends on a bunch of factors Like how comfortable I am in my life and stuff The project doesn't really get any bigger anymore It hasn't gotten bigger in a while I think I should upload the analogue 3D song just alongside the review Like on the Keysclips channel I think that makes the most sense And then you guys just have to be hyped for it But I don't think it should be in the main channel video Because it might be perceived as more hostile than I want it to be Oh, that's like clearly floating If it wasn't clearly floating I think it'd be fine You guys catching up to Mimi? No, it's just seconds But she hasn't really developed a consciousness yet You asking me if I'm gonna add a CRT filter to the game? No Play it on a CRT, bozo CRT filters feel so fake It's like, I don't have a CRT, but I'm the biggest CRT fanboy I wanna be part of the CRT club I don't even know who that is Oh, to scam the beta kids Okay, I see I can't see the angle It's like taking candies from children, which is flying by me. Alright, now we've got this setup. Then we just need to make it so that when you press on it, there's like sparkles. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna program a sparkle that follows along the spline. You press this and the sparkle goes. And then the switch goes back up once the sparkle ends here. Then when it hits this, it flings up. It's like taking Tenta from Ubisoft, which is not as easy as it seems. True! I'm gonna have nightmares about that today. Alright. Like a boss! Alright. This is kinda cool. Boo! I have sparkles, yes. I might just make an actor that's like just sparks going in a spiky direction. But I think this is it for now. We're now on part 8 out of 15, which means we are beyond the halfway point. We were already beyond the halfway point, because we already did the most difficult part. So this one I imagine it's maybe one or two more streams. This one might actually be a little more. This one might actually be a couple streams. This one's going to be pretty easy. This one's going to be basically no work at all. This one's going to be a little bit of work. This one's going to be a little bit of work. And this one's going to be super easy. Yeah. I think we're probably around 70% of the way through the overworld now. Part 8 out of 15? I don't know why you're seeing that. Out of 15. Anyway. I will see you guys in the next stream. Until then, bye bye! Yes, the ghostly twister. Bye bye.
