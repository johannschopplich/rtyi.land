Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Next links. Hello, Trek Delta. Hello, James. Hello,  Hello, Robin. Hello, Ben and Mikasa. What does that mean? I mean, you can let's scrub through it. I've seen it before. Hello, James. That's 15. That's this level here. Hello, Robin. Hello, Ben and Mikasa. I'm working on this one for eternity. Hello, Ben and Mikasa. Hello, Ben and Mikasa. You know what, it's actually good that I sneezed. Because Dariel wanted to have a sound clip of me sneezing for the compact we're working on. I had an insane stream idea concept. And that would be, I just work on a hack. Like, we plan a 30 day stream, 12 hours a day or 14 hours a day, maybe 16. 12 hours we stream every day. And the goal in the stream is to make a full major Mario 64 hack. And like for every $1,000 of every $500 donated, we add an extra day of stream. You know what I mean? You think that would be fun? So like the more people donate, the higher quality the hack is going to be. I think that could be the money idea. And I think that would be very fun, too. Deaf tones? No. No. No. Yeah, it would be fun to see like the full development of a full game. Like in real time on stream. At least that would be the idea. Hopefully this is fun to watch. For charity? No. For my bank account. I'm not doing 30 days of working 15 hours a day for our charity. That would be fun. Yo, easy, Aza. I might join VC after I'm done here. Yeah, who are the men that say no? You're meeting other women behind my back? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.  No. No. No. No. No. No. No.   That's bad. There we go. Goldfinger64, let's do it. Right, okay. So the idea with this area here, you use these bumpers to get around the plantation. And I still need to make half the plantation. But I quite like the movement here. And a Kobayashi. Swagging. And a little skip there. Dude, this is so fun. I like this area. Beastess OST is a good one, but it's for sure getting me demonetized. Hello, NotKirbyNate. Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. I don't want a Mario Tennis Retro Pipe. Personally, I am a Mario Tennis hater. And I can tell you why. This is a long story. Back when I was a little tyke of just 12 years old, I went on vacation with my best friend and his family. And played a bunch of video games. And we had already beaten basically every single one of those video games. Except Mario Power Tennis. And so during this whole vacation, we basically only played Mario Power Tennis. And we got like all the stars on all the characters. And I hated it the whole way through. Fuck Mario Tennis. Mr. Rocket and everything. Over here. Oh yeah, you guys haven't even seen this yet. Look what this area looks like now. Eh, what do you think? It's a little better now, isn't it? Oh yeah, as someone DMed me, they wanted to replace your textures here with their own. Right now we have this, but I think this is worse than what we had before. So, let's see. ... It's worse, awesome. Well, if they put in enough work, I think they can make it better, so we'll see. They seem pretty skilled at what they're doing. We also have these signs now that just point to the factory. So that's a little less noisy visuals and more clarity on where to go, I hope. I think this level now has a little bit of the sauce, you know what I mean? Like before the level felt like it had no sauce. And now it has a bit of sauce. Dude, it's so funny you mentioned the melancholy of Haruizusumiya. I finished the anime and the movie yesterday. Just yesterday! And now suddenly someone's bringing it up? That's a crazy coincidence. The movie is so good, actually. Dude, I watched all of The Endless Eight, too. ... There's things I like about it and things I hate about it. Like Kion is just too stupid. Sometimes. And I don't like that. And I don't like that people don't push back more against Haru when she's clearly being abusive. Sometimes it feels like it's played for jokes when it shouldn't be. But overall, the concept of it, I like a lot. But I liked season 1 a lot more than season 2. Not even because of The Endless Eight. Season 2, I don't like it because it feels more slice of life than the first one. And less interesting stuff. ... Excuse me, but I think the blue objects match with the blue galaxy background. I wonder if you can use more purple shoes for the background. Let me take another look at this. I don't think they clash. I think they complement each other. This is true. Platforms need more clear borders. You're absolutely right in saying that. This is an issue that this edge here is hard to see, for example. But it's not an issue here because there's a clear blue glow. So I think what I'm going to do is... I'm going to have glowing outlines on all the platforms in The End. I also think this one here is no issue. Because there's a clear boundary. Baby likes my stream? Let's go! Is this considered Unreal Hardware? Um... I think on emulator, the render distance is just removed. And on Unreal Hardware, I have not yet adjusted the render distance. But it shouldn't be an issue to get this render distance on Unreal Hardware. Is that not like an N64? The N64 is more powerful than people think, I guess. Let's find the inspiration. I... Think of the theme. And then I close my eyes. And I look at the inside of my eyelids. And then I just see it. Sometimes. Other times, I just think about it. So... How do we make low-poly crops? I want crops here. And I need them to be low-poly. And I need them to look fine here. We might just have to copy the glow stuff from here as well. Because the glow stuff is really nice. I think I have an idea what kind of crops we could put in here. And... Not that. Not that. They cannot be middle-boarded. But I'm thinking a crop that's just this with the texture on it would look good here. Maybe I'll try glow effect. Is there glow effects all over this level? What do you mean? I don't know. I'm making a decent looking level that doesn't look out of whack in game. I don't know. I'm not the expert. And it's still not good enough for the first level. No. Just green lumps arranged in lines. Yeah, pretty much. I think that's pretty much what this will be. The same thing is true for the Hari show as well. It's running as the animation. I don't know if some of its characters are in the movie. But I'd like to see more of it. Again, this is about Hari herself. Some people miss how she changes by the end. I don't think she changed that much. When she puts her hair in the ponytail in the first few episodes, it's basically exactly the same thing she does at the ending. And then in the movie, it's also weird about this thing like, oh, reality is so depressing for this broken girl that she wants to change the whole world. I don't know if we can just undo that. And then they're like, okay, well, actually, fuck it. Let's just undo it. With no change whatsoever. Should at least have some kind of acknowledgement. Like, okay, well, I guess we'll treat you better now. I guess we were big assholes. This shit's not going well. Fuck her then. Thank you for helping me ruin your life. What happened to the DLC? For some reason, it paused. I'm someone who likes shows for like either concept, like if I think the idea of the show is good, then I'll enjoy it. I'll enjoy like indulging in the fantasies a bit. And that's like a show that delivers on that. Can we arrange these flowers in some kind of a meat pattern here? I think we can. What if we use radial symmetry here? 90 doesn't work. 36, 70. Something like that. I don't think I've watched either one of those two. I am by no means an anime expert, unfortunately. Well, fortunately actually. I think I'm glad I'm not an anime expert. Okay, now there's definitely a pattern to it. And it's kind of neat, but I don't like how samey the flowers look. So we're going to make them go slightly different. And I also like to sort of look like flowers, but rather like some kind of crop. Yeah, I don't think I like the things on the flower scene, but I don't think it should look like flowers at all. Instead of calling this world Cosmic Colony, because that's what it looks like to me. Yeah, Cosmic Colony is a good name. Creation of Robotics Color. That too. Sorry, I moved my watch there. That does sound extremely funny to follow. Super Mario Tron level. I've heard that before. But isn't Tron like, I know Tron is like a video game, but people also use it as a slur. I feel like maybe we shouldn't be calling it that. Yeah, Iris, I think that would be cool. Hello, Solomon. Oh, J-Maxx in a domes and random location. That sounds like an awful idea. Oh, it's a movie. What? Oh, I thought this was a video game. Yeah, yeah, I can see how this is kind of similar. Yeah, I've seen this before and I thought this was a video game. Kind of like when you play Snake against each other. You're telling me this is older than Snake? The movie is older than the actual Snake? I'm not a very cultured human being. I did not watch many movies. It's the first Ray Traced movie. This would be like perfect for what we want to do. Maybe this is better. That looks more like plants growing. Yeah, yeah, that's better. Did the guy who invented Perlin noise was involved? That's crazy. This is a nice flower. I want this one. Or not flower, leaf. What are you making now? Space greenhouse? Yep, this is part of the space level. And this is like a side section where you platform a lot. Wow. That looks fine to me. Don't decoherence, don't tessellate. Devastating. I want to play Cyberpunk eventually, but I don't want to pay for it. Anyone know where I could just get the game for free without getting a virus on my computer? Ooh, that looks rough. Ew. I don't like these individual pixels floating around. That is a big issue. Why does that happen anyway? That's better. Yeah. What's the scaled for? Did you redeem like a song request thing? You have to tell me if you redeemed that, because I can't see it. You did? Alright, let's redeem your song request. Rivals of Utah. Hello, Maticat. You have definitely seen me before. Because I have read your name before. Don't lie to me. Is there going to be some reason we have to go to space in this game, or is it just not really the ending you wanted to go for? We haven't really planned the story yet. I think it's better to just put together some gameplay first, and then plan the story around the gameplay you have. Because it's a Mario game. Hello, Clayman. How is the play going? I don't know what I'm asking. Oh, yeah, that looks sick. Oh, that looks so cool. Very coolest you ever made. I think the last one I made was pretty good. I like Hoily Boily Bay a lot. The western level has a lot of potential, but right now it's kind of garbage. Because we're learning Alpha Channel independently. Not with the 16-color format. What do you think of this glow effect here? See how it matches the light on the outside? That's really cool. What do you think of this glow effect here? And we need something for here. Really what we're doing now is we already made the platforming, and now we're just trying to justify the platforms we've made.  Dude, you can definitely shortcut here. Wait. I want to try to speedrun this area real quick. I want to see what the speedrun strat would be like. I feel like at the start you would definitely just jump over this. And hit it from behind. Something like that seems reasonable too. And then I think here is where it gets really interesting. I'm pretty sure you can, if you're good at the game. Do something like that, which is pretty cool. We're going to make this climbable. And once this is climbable, I bet you can be LJ over there. Let me try to make this climbable and see what happens. It's not as easy as it looks. I think that was kind of similar to the 1-level boss, in fact. Because they both play in space. That's in space, it has plants. Oh yeah, I know what you mean. The space garden. Oh, the side level. Or the side area is close to that, yeah. You're right. Although, the space garden is really just like a free nature garden. And this one is very clearly a plantation. I think there is still a good amount of difference between the two. Sometimes people say that PLJ is gone in this game. And I disagree. Okay. Maybe it is gone. My fucking game crashed. What? I did not make PLJ crash on purpose, by the way. Okay, yeah, that's absolutely the speedrun strategy. That is so cool. But it sometimes crashes, and I don't know why. Okay. It seems easy enough to reproduce. I have zero doubt that I can just fix it. What the hell? It's terrible too, because I have to restart the emulator. But you can definitely PLJ over there. And then bump into this. And get up here. Yeah. And then this is another one of my favorite parts of this level's speedrun here. You can like make it here. Yeah, this is gonna be a super fun section, I think. I don't know what to cover with called PLJ. No, it's not the triangles. It's clearly something in the PLJ code itself causing an infinite loop somewhere. Anyway, how do we justify this existing? I think this should have a staircase-like texture, at least.  Also, this definitely needs to be different. Actually, let's start with the bumper. I think the sponsor needs to change. It's no longer a casino, it's something else now.  No, BLJs are just untouched. But it seems right now there's something in the BLJ that unintentionally crashes. Because I didn't explicitly support BLJ. So I guess I have to explicitly support it somehow. Basically. The TLDR. Colossal Circuits is the best level we've played. But it's also crazy. Colossal Circuits is, to me, just a bunch of ideas thrown together. But that's all of Lost Empire. Back to me. Now, how would they fit in here? Like, how do we make them fit rather? I think the color scroll at the bottom has to change to be less rainbow and more fitting with the hues we present here in the rest of the level. And maybe the spring itself can be more metallic. Let's see. I think this needs the reflective material mapped onto it. Let's take a second material. I want something like this. What is going on? Ow, what? This is true. My head does work on the IQA player. China number one. So as far as I know, we're all about space crops and other life forms and capsules. No, it's just crops. The story is basically this whole thing is like a space civilization. And they're using that to like growth crops. Bro, what's going on? Am I insane? Host is not working at all. Thank you for the 12 month sub. I don't know why there's no sound. So I'm probably going to miss a bunch of those today. Awesome. I have made an Ocarina of Time hack. If you're not heard in the legend of in the missing link. No, it's not from something losing it. How is this possible? I'm just going to put this in game and I bet it's going to show up in game. I bet this is a fast 64 buck. What's the issue with just having a staircase then? There's none. I just ended up doing this one first. That's an add-on called fast 64. No, Nintendo removed a bunch of my Romics before. But missing link was definitely too good. They had to kill it or they would have looked back fools. So this shows up, huh? Ah. Okay, maybe the shine was just a terrible idea then. Maybe we just go with this. So we definitely need to change the color of this one though, because this is extremely unfitting. Why not Sepetala? What's the issue with me using this emulator? I'm not going to hack myself. The problem is that there is literally no other decent emulator around. So, like, what am I supposed to do? All the other emulators have some issues that make them just less usable for me. Springs launch you further when you go around on them. How fast is this thing in real hardware? Well, I just click this button here. And now the game is uploaded to my N64. You might as well see how this performs. 43 FPS. Ooh, it doesn't like all these plants here. And there's some sort of look-at issue. Yeah, I think the springs look good now, or better at least. Don't buy even an emulator, because it's faster. And also because this is like half a second of input lag. So playing on this kind of sucks. Because he doesn't own a real N64? Sure, whatever. Yeah, I guess that's the reason now. You know, while I use my whole performance budget to make the game nicer, I would not just leave room in there for no reason. I think the color just makes it look like it's glowing. I don't like that. I don't like that. Yeah, that's gonna fit better for the springs. The horizontal resolution is the same as an R64. I don't like this either. That's fine, Eiza. We don't have many slimmits in RTYI anyway. Keep in mind when I make these, that most of this is going to be reworked by the debug anyway. So even if something seems worse at the moment, it's probably going to get better. That's kind of nice. I think I'll just do this for now. You're right, giving the star a blinking animation when it hits Mario would be kind of cool. Let's look into that, see if we can do that real quick. It's increasing saturation. This is just a shit setup. We should just not have this setup. What the hell is this? Let's make this something decent here instead of this piece of shit. Putting any two-player options to good use in this game? I don't know. Hello, Zero Vault. A glossy red environment now. Probably, but let's just... I think this is fine for now. Guys, why do you ask me so many questions today? That's my least favorite thing to happen ever. Can't we just have a normal conversation that's not case-getting interrogated? Yeah, like so. Imagine this is the normal state. Maybe this is the normal state, and then when the shaboing happens, he goes like this. No, it doesn't do anything different on the ground pounds. I don't want that, I want this to feel as consistent as possible. Because it looks cool in 3D, that's why. This can be up to CSGO, I think. Let's take this color here. I wasn't even born yet, either. 11D776? That seems like crazy talk to me. D91832? Why do you mean this part here? You mean this part? On this part, I can maybe see it, but why are all your colors desaturated? It should probably slightly blink before, so you know it's an interactive element. Maybe do this, and then go back to black. Right? I think this would be fine. What would you do with Obsessive-Crazy-Fan-Nicked-Audio-Source code? Literally nothing, I would maybe ask people not to play it, because it's not done yet. But I would probably be better off not telling people about it. Because when you tell people about it, then it's more likely that people will know about it if you play it early. Thanks for watching! I'm planning to open source this game anyway, so there's little point in leaking it. All you're really doing by leaking it is to make it so a bunch of people play a worse version of the game hasn't yet finished. Post-game content. There's post-game content. Orn, what do you mean? Rebound. That's not what I'm looking for. Oh, we already used Opacity here. That's fine. We can just use health. The most important required post-game content. You can now play as Luigi. Luigi wouldn't be so bad to add. Luigi would be pretty simple to add. Except for maybe the voices. Even the voices should be easy. I mean, what's the difference between the base game and the post-game, right? There's just like... I can just keep adding shit, but it's just becoming a bigger and bigger base game. Or is the post-game to you anything you do after you beat the final boss? Which I guess there can be some stuff. For me, gaming is all about freedom. So maybe I would do something like give people more freedom. Maybe you can have like the room cap anywhere you want.  All the bugs you found are like minor collision issues. Every game has those. I don't see it blinking. Did I export this? I did not. No wonder it doesn't work. I didn't even import it into the game yet. If I know what I want to play in the post-game, then we can like maybe speed-boost the enemy's movement speed. Yeah, it would have to be something like that. I'm right, and I'm also not using any health units. Oh, interesting. What could be the issue? It could be that it doesn't correctly link into the object here. So let's fix this. Well, Luigi does have a tackle stand in this game. Okay, so the value changes, but prim color does not leak in. That's very good to know. So somewhere here we must be setting prim color, and it must ruin everything. I didn't un-tick that. It won't do it. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Wrong RGBs. It's blinking, but not as fast as I'd like. That's gonna be too fast. Okay, there we go. That's nice. Nice. All right, now justify this somehow, or rather make this look like something. I don't like that this is just like a plain color staircase. I think it needs clearer boundaries, and I think I need some kind of texture here. Also, one thing I'm thinking of, maybe these pentagons here need some kind of glowing border like this. I think otherwise it might look a little inconsistent. I think I like the brace brightness. It's just great to be able to see the difference. Anyway, I think we should also have some texture here that is kind of like this here. What if we literally use that? Okay. Precision machine that brings in the crops. Yeah, some machinery to farm crops would be fine here too. Like it's just like a style thing, but right now I'm not really focused on that. I think this wouldn't be so bad. Let me see how the animation works out in game. The field of view is not something I want to change. I think that would change the entire feeling of Mario 64. I also think this is something that's just like normal in every game. I can make it shorter like this, and like, it's nasty. There is no cameraman in this game. No animation. Yeah. Hello, Sarah. No animation on that. Okay. Okay. Okay.  What the hell? Oh, I have an idea. I know exactly what the issue is. There we go. That's what I needed. Oh, that is so much better. Yeah. I like that. Send a pic of semi comprehensive mini level 41. Let's see what you got. I'm sliding. All right. That's some nice sliding. I like it. Oh, and this is what the flower petals. All right. Is this also going to be with the upwards draft? You want that back in? Do you also want the loopings back in here? We can bring all of that back. The only thing we really need to make sure is that they don't overlap. One. And two, that the edges of the wind is like 100% clear. No loops. That's that's good. All right. Well, you can have loops if you want. I kind of like loops. We should have loops. But definitely, definitely make sure that the paths don't overlap from any camera setting and that the edges are very, very visible. And probably also like a smaller fade out at the edges. All right. That's good. All right. Thank you for the donation. I am not really sure what you mean by I changed your perspective. That's cool, though. I'm trying my best to make a good game. I feel like right now, people don't respect ROM hack as like real games. Even ROM hack don't seem to do that. So I definitely want to change that. I want to make sure that this ROM hack is also like playable as like a normal game without the context of Mario 64. When I was talking to ROM hack yesterday, they seemed to think that the concept of like a ROM hack standing on its own legs is like completely frivolous and impossible. Which, dang, that's that's depressing if you are living your life like that. You're hacking Mario and you think you're moving garbage, basically. That's sad. And basically, I used to think as a hero as much as you did was. Scummy, but proof that there's love to what people make, especially as far as I'm concerned. Oh, you thought it was scummy? That's interesting. Never heard of someone saying they think it's scummy. So basically you thought it was like ripping off Nintendo's work and like, pretending you made something good when really you're just kind of like leeching off of Nintendo. I guess that is true for a lot of people. A lot of people don't really... They don't try to like design a Mario 65. They just kind of like do use Mario's movement and just like, yep, that's my whole game. My whole game is just But I wouldn't say that's scummy, you know, if anything it's like maybe lazy and worst. I think Nintendo sees it as leeching? I don't think so. I don't think Nintendo thinks like that. Nintendo's just a corporation. The only thing in terms of if you lose money from it or not. Have I tried Micromages? Nope. But yeah, then what I've said just before is extra relevant for you. So there is a lot of people that do make Mario 64X and they do think that a romhack can never be like good as a game by itself. They all go in with the idea that I am specifically doing something for people that like Mario 64 and no one else. If you're actually making a game that's the same as Super Mario but everything else is different, would it be illegal to sell? I have no idea. But that would be a very important question to know the answer to. Well actually I'm not even planning to do that. Kero Quest however is pretty close to what you're describing I think. The movement is very very inspired by Mario 64 which makes sense probably just a Mario 64 hacker. What's it called? Kero Quest. I can show you. This is a kickstarter they started recently. Yeah you can tell immediately this is a brodied model. And the movement is very much the same as Mario 64. There was the long jump. That's the punch. You have to jump and the double jump. Jump, jump, double jump. Even that is like the same and the ground pound is the same. The backflip is the same. So I can't see if someone was saying that this is like a kind of a ripoff. Bro I play Melee with Home Engine Hero Destroyers. I think everything is bad unless they're actively making money off of therapy. True, Nintendo hates Melee. If Mario 64 was made it was more expensive to have more memory than 8 megabytes. So that's why they used 8 megabytes. It would have made the money cost a lot more game to distribute basically. And it's even made me think in runs on the N64. No, it's just Mario 64 inspired. Oh yeah, I'm definitely not someone who wrote a lot of copyright laws there. I'm just saying it's a little blatant. I guess N64 ROM names can't be as long as Nintendo's Island name is. And I clearly need something else here. What do I need to do here? It's getting multiplied by 5 and it's 80. 16. I don't like that. That looks bad and you can see the seam here. Hmm. You can no longer see the seam. That's good. I've never used Linux. Well, I have, but that was kind of annoying. I'm not a Linux or Windows defender. My characteristics say I was going to be an N64 run. RedHead has never made an N64 game. He's only made more N64 hacks that run on emulators. I think it, I mean, to me it was pretty obvious that it wasn't going to run on N64. The Slack tick has some applications on speedruns, but like a normal player would never use it realistically. The thing I like the most about Linux is that I can turn off updates and that I don't get Windows spyware installed, but also I really don't want to compile shit over the terminal to be able to use my programs. I'm not that much of a fucking nerd. This just kind of looks ass, man. Why don't we use this texture here instead? It's kind of nice. I kind of like that. Again, why Windows updates are required? It's like, I don't know, someone will find a vulnerability and hack all your accounts. Fair enough. But man, can you like at least when you make an update not break anything? Could you not test the production, please?  I do live, I do hope that we live in a future soon where Linux is like consumer grade stuff and not just nerds that like to play with computer stuff. Because it would be very nice to have a competitor to Windows. Everyone benefits if Windows is like doing poorly. It's just like a blanket good for humanity. I still just don't agree with the beef people have with AI. I don't think it's that bad. I know this is a very unpopular opinion. I think what's going on is you're just experiencing existential regrets because the machine can do things that you thought were making you as a human special. But it isn't. And you're not actually that special. And now you have to confront that fact. You know what I mean? It's just like a Google. I don't experience existential dread. It's just that AI like Google's shit at the beginning of when you open sites. And all the stupid games use it so poorly. Imagine Black Ops 3 sounds awesome and Black Ops 3 is poor. I have no idea what any of that shit is supposed to mean. I think you're complaining about the Google AI summary like your search results which fair enough. I agree that one is pretty poorly done. It's not a problem with AI. That's a problem with Google making a stupid decision. That's kind of cool looking. But when there's stuff like forcing me up then I don't want to or I might want to use create something out of myself. That's when the AI becomes a problem. That's not AI doing it. That's Microsoft doing it. And they're already doing it. Oh yeah, AI is definitely being used as a buzzword for marketing right now. No, that's not a buzzword. That's not a buzzword. That's not a buzzword. You know what I find bizarre? People always act like investors are like so out of touch and like they are the ones pushing garbage. But like they are doing pretty extensive mathematical analysis to make sure that they're allocating their money optimally. I feel like they're making sensible decisions at least. And today I'm on a bad or unpopular hot take spree. It's kind of annoying when AI features are added to everything just for the sake of having AI features because they're actually useful. That is true. That is really stupid. I found like a notepad thing that I added video scripts in and when I click in the wrong place it like generates an AI paragraph and it's so dumb. YouTube has been using AI for recommendations for like 20 years now. I don't think that will happen Sammy. AI is not magic. So man are millennials really the last generation but like or the only generation ever that had like a good childhood. Think about it. Pretty much everyone before us either lived in like conditions where you could just starve and die or like you get a cold and then you die and like everyone after us lives in the fucking apocalypse. I guess the boomers had a good too. Life truly is suffering. I don't know if we are in the upper goblins, but everyone's saying we are. It seems to be the common belief. I think I can still be fine with some technological progress, no big problem. Hello, Cuckedeath. They're going to go into engravers, but people who think it can and use it that way believe in everything gets better if you let AI do it. Yeah, but those people are going to perish, right? And again, that's not an AI issue, that's a people issue. Stupid people have been an issue since the dawn of humanity. That's the emulator I meant to open. That's a dangerous application, baby. What the hell am I listening to? Hip to be square in the GoldenEye soundfont? Okay, the glowing meat rims really work well to outline the platforms, I think. Life is hard, but it's harder when you're stupid. I don't even agree that life is hard. Life is fuckin' easy, what do you mean? I mean, we had the Industrial Revolution, which was very similar to this, and honestly our living conditions got a lot better after that. Who says that won't happen again? I think our problem isn't AI, our problem is getting milked dry by really rich people. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Really, you can always generate new work by putting in a new committee or something. Alright, next part of the stage. What the fuck is this here? I have not decided on that yet. And also there should be some kind of thing here, I think. Grab me that one, Rockstar. Ugh, color vomit. This is so unpleasant to look at. There are some cool ideas though, but why did I make this so unpleasant? Yay, color happiness. So pleasant to look at. But most of Kirby looks good, it's just this one kinda looks like ass. What the hell did you make me listen to, Eiza? See ya, Vyran. Me with a suspiciously government-shaped belly. Yeah, you told me to listen to this. The Golden Finger OST. This autoplayed from the Golden Finger OST. This is the Golden Finger OST, Eiza. Or at least this is what YouTube thinks the Golden Finger OST is. Got nothing coming right in, is this a song request? Are you listening to this? And the second question, is there a way to re-enable FPS in the game? Is there a fetish? Nope, there is not. There is no FPS display in the final game. You know, what plants can we put here? Or what is the role of this in a plantation? We could make this... Hmm. Like a silo? A tank in the middle? One of those tanks here? No, we don't need any houses. Something like this, good work. And then it's like a water tank here. Is this still beatable? Let me see how this feels. What is this all supposed to be? It's a space colony and this is where they plant their crops. And their farm. It will look a lot more like a farm at the start of the level. You'll see in a second. Yay, crops! Yay, more crops! This is still doable, but I don't like how difficult this is. This feels jank to me. Right? Is this jank? I can't tell. We could add a panel there to lock it up off. So you go and shoot, lock it, and then over there. But that's even more difficult. Yeah, I don't want the player to do a jank jump like this. There's many ways to do this jump. You could do that too. Or just a long jump. Or you could even do that. Or you could... I bet you could do that too. Nope, you can't do that. Well, we'll definitely still add lights so that you'll be able to easily see the rims of the platform. I'm not worried about that. I am worried about the jump just not being fun. Because it's like a weird jump, and I don't want the player to do a weird jump like that. I'm not adding random references to random video games in my game. Is there a meaning to the constant screaming that haunts me in the night? Do we move the platform itself? Not really. I do what I have to to keep myself alive. To see the traitor's heart before my eyes. We could add a platform here that's like smaller. What was that? Was that a donation? Was that bits? What happened? Yo, thank you for the 90 months, Kyukiram! Oh my god. That's forever. Holy... That's like almost 8 years. Yeah, I was thinking too a small platform here would maybe be good. Kyukiram, are you still like active around the scene? It feels like I haven't seen you in forever. Wait, did you gift subs? Did I miss something? Oh my god, wait, you gifted a shit ton of subs! Wait, I missed this. How many subs did you gift? Oh my god, all my alerts are not here. 5 subs to me. Alright, thank you for the 5. Working on all the decoms. Oh, that's cool, that's cool. I'm surprised you're not like in the fast64 discord. It's like the main discord where I am for figuring out new tech. I'm glad you like it. That wasn't a bug, that was me moonjumping. Where's my platform? Hey, no I didn't even export it. Either way, I think this is good enough. This is good, I like this. The question is what do we stream this after? Alright, back to GoldenEye. I say GoldenEye, but it's really this. I don't know Zelda, do you want me to quit? Are you asking when you can leave? I'm not forcing you to be here. It should maybe be completely different metal platforms. What if it was wooden bars, but made out of metal? I like streaming usually, I just don't like when people ask me a bunch of questions about things I don't want to talk about. Yeah, streaming is very exhausting, especially for someone with my personality type. Actually, now that I think about it, metal bars looking like wooden bars wouldn't have very good portals, so that's the one reason I wouldn't want to do that. Stripes. Let me try something. I should do that here actually, not over there. Because this is axis aligned. There's a lot of people that just can't do diagonal wall jumps, so I don't want that to ever be a required tech. Oh well, there's one place in the game where I did require it at some point, and I got complaints about that a lot. Five lights on a glowing platform, like Fresno Transparent, I have no idea what you're talking about. Hello Wufu. Yup, it just re-played, it just auto-played on the GoldenEye N64 full remake album. We were listening to the GoldenFinger OST before. Wow Voicel, are you saying I'm not worth your $5? That is so rude. I will not accept an apology, the only thing I will accept is a subscription. I'm so offended right now, I need money to feel better. I'm kidding. I will not accept an apology, the only thing I will accept is a subscription.  It's kind of nice looking. I think we can do something with this. How is the marketing and modding community nowadays? I really understood the stream and that's it. Last time I saw you it was like 7 years ago with Starlord and stuff. Now that DCOM is around it's a lot easier for people to make custom stuff. So nowadays a lot of remakes are filled with new mechanics and stuff. I think that's one big difference. I don't think it's necessarily a positive change though. I don't think it's necessarily a positive change though. We're taking a bedroom into WoW for diagonal jumps. We can try it. Let's try it. Why not? What do we have to lose? Let's see how this plays. Dude, being a Smash Bros. Brawl romaker would be fun. Imagine if instead of Mario 64 I had started Hacking Smash Bros. Melee or Sonic Adventure. My life would be so different now. I'd love to make Smash Bros. Melee balance patches. And keep a competitive scene alive on Earth. That would be so fun. Nintendo needs to put out skins for Smash Bros. Melee that you can buy. And then we have that kind of scene. This is a fun challenge. There's of course the risk of me doing that. But I feel like people wouldn't do that. I feel like people would do the wall jump correctly here. Maybe this is good. And this really isn't that difficult. Because you can just do that, right? And this feels pretty cool. I think I like it. And if you're really too scared of doing that, you can still do this. It's like a newbie strategy, I guess. Is this really a newbie strategy though? This feels harder, if anything. Okay, what if... What if we make the newbie strategy easier to execute? So that newbies can realistically do the newbie strategy. Yeah, or you can long jump over it, true. Giving people the freedom to choose isn't that bad. Okay. I fucked it up. Okay. Yeah, you can do this now. Which I think is easy enough. And then... This one's kind of difficult to do. But it very clearly looks like the intended way. Which I kind of like. And then also, of course, you can just long jump over. Okay. Yeah, sure, let's just add a dialogue to the game. For no reason. That is good game design. Everyone loves reading text in the game. For no reason. Okay, we also need crops in here. Oh, and we need crops here. And we need to make the water tank look like a water tank. Invisible walls don't exist. At least they're not supposed to exist. In that case, I should remove the invisible walls. Not make you walk in front of them. Okay. Water tank. We can give this an old blue glow. We definitely need to have this be full of water from the top. Maybe we need to make it look like it's full of water from the side, too. Like an actual water bottle. If you look at it from here, you already see it being filled with water. Hmm. I think the platform size is good. I think the platform size is good. Going around Mario spawns on Reno, so it should have an effect when lights up Mario's rocks or what. It will. I just haven't made the collision map yet. I need to make the collision map so that I can read the collision map and be like, Oh, it's this collision that means add a glow under Mario. I've probably done this in one place in the other area here, I can show you. I've probably done this in one place in the other area here, I can show you. Like right here, you see that? It's gonna be like that all over the level. Or here, too. And there's gonna be point lights here, so Mario lights up when he's here. Also, the coins they're moving is for sure a bug. I don't know what's going on there. Alright, let's look at the bug. Let's see how dark it is. My workout is going well. Except I fucked up my bag doing deadlifts. Show us your mouse. My mouse. What do water storages look like in space?   What do water storages look like in space? I guess that makes sense, they would not be see-through. Any water in the pipe store? Edible water? This is an interesting thing. Interesting look. I like the frills on it. Should we add frills to our water tanks? And make them blue, reflecting white? You're actually subbing, Royso? Oh my god, thank you for your pocket money. I don't even know what to say. You're so sweet.        I don't think I can stream tomorrow, unfortunately. I have a meeting with the person that I'm making Banjo-Kazooie with Mario64 with and I can't just skip that. I would stream more, but I have a meeting basically every single day. That makes it so I can't go and stream more. Wait, this can be a one second material. This is true, I am paying Aza for propagandas. This fucking cursed image that Doriel sent me. I'm overwriting this. You're liking the What The Wednesdays? I hope I don't forget it again next Wednesday, because I often forget them. Time to jump into the gorgeous case model. Do you really want to reveal it right now to everyone? Oh shiny! So overflow-y. Does this really look like water? It is a water dispenser. Okay, well that's good. I'm glad you think it looks like a water dispenser because it is. Okay, something bad happened. Something really bad happened. I made the wrong material. Did I completely destroy the material? Oh. Oh.  This is what it was, right? Okay, save the thing. That looks saved, yeah. Does anybody remember how you do the level backgrounds? No. This is really just one function that I post, like, I posted this a few times. RainbowPG. What is it? Here! This is all it is. Well, actually, this won't translate into normal Markz64. But I posted this somewhere on SimpleFlips Discord. You can just copy it if you look for this function name here. Now we should have programmable tanks here. Yeah, this is a very nice technique for backgrounds. It's also a lot cheaper than normal Markz64 backgrounds, because you don't have nearly as many textures, and it saves a lot of memory as well. So absolutely recommend it. We're not having level-specific costumes, so that's gonna explode into so much work. Yes, it still doesn't look like a proper highlight here. Probably because of the subtracted part here. If I just use, like, a different texture, it will be fine. I should probably also, like, multiply the color to add, like, some shadings here. I think that would add a lot. Let's bring back the second cycle. Sometimes it doesn't work. I guess I should use this to remove random shit from my UI repo. Yeah, basically that. Oh. Maybe I should. I don't know, I heard backgrounds have always felt really bad to me compared to the Source game mods. Oh, is this how the Source engine does it too? That makes sense. I think any decent engine would handle skyboxes like that. I don't see a reason not to handle skyboxes like this, honestly. Okay, that's good. Where's the overflow happening? Probably here. Okay, perfect. Okay. Okay. That's basically what I do here too. I kind of just have, like, a box that follows the camera. So, you can set by what percentage it follows the camera. So, for, like, the space background, I have, like, 100%, that way it feels like it's infinitely far away. But for, like, the oil rig, I have it set to, like, 95%, so it feels like it's actually somewhat close. Seems like a really cool feature to have, I think. The color of these platforms changed. I haven't recreated the material correctly.  Or have I recreated it perfectly and it's just looking different in-game than in Blender? Okay, yeah, it's the same color here.  What do you mean by level decor?  Why does the skybox need to be part of the map the player is running around? It just makes sense to me. It's not. You see the skybox here? The skybox is right here. It's completely different. I'm not 100% sure I'm letting Mario swim around in here yet or not. I think Mario swimming around here is gonna be really jank to deal with for me as, like, the level designer. I don't know. No, Mario can't go there. Actually, Mario is, like, nowhere near there. Actually, it's, like, around the camera. Like, in 3D rendering space, it's around the camera. Where do you want the skybox to be is the question, I guess. Like, how do you want it to be rendered? I'm not sure I understand what you're suggesting here. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think I need the dynamic CPU-generated texture here. What do you think of these skybox system cases that optimize shit by pretty genius world devs? It's a pretty standard trick. It's a good way to do it. They probably could have... I don't know if they... How they handle Z-buffering and padding out stuff there. But you could probably reduce overdraw significantly on that. That's my first thought on how to make it better. I don't know. You know, I'm thinking this should be, like, absolutely still water with no bubbles whatsoever. And even the movement it has right now is way too much, I think. And it's gonna be darker around the edges. So we have to probably make a CPU-generated texture here. Something that computes something that looks more like this. Still water. Let's look at this. Kinda like that, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not brainwashed right now. If you think still water is a brainwashed term, then I think you're the brainwashed one. Hmm. I wanna look, though. Maybe, like, bubbling lava? Maybe we should look at that. Bubbling lava. Yeah. No. No. No. Is there no image of, like, still lava? I guess lava is pretty energetic. Slow lava. That's not very slow. That's not slow. That's not slow. That's not slow. Also not slow. What are you looking for? A reference?       A reference for the animation of the water texture on top of here. I want this to be something that's not just a static texture, but also something very slow-moving. Lava lake? Hmm. No wind. Maybe just lake? Yeah, I like this kinda. Yeah. That's too much wind. Too much wind. Hmm. No, I'm not gonna look at Minecraft, but I'm definitely gonna just program something. Hmm. Okay, maybe like a GIF of still water? All of these waters are moving too fast. Bro, I have water right in front of me. It's not doing shit. Hmm. What if instead of all that, we just had like, small waves coming from the middle? I think that's our best thing to do here. Hmm. Like an extremely slow version of this, basically. Or maybe like so, like inwards even. Cause like the water is technically flowing out. I have seen that style, it looks pretty good. Hmm. Anyway, I think I'm feeling pretty done for today. So I will see you guys in the next stream, which is going to hopefully be soon. I don't know when yet. Until then, bye bye!
