You you you There we go. I'm sure now you can hear me. I mean, yeah, the How are you responding to me if I muted? What is the OST that we would like to listen to today? There we go. This is what I Hello, tea time. Sure, let's do it. This is a 964 game. Looks like it. Oh, wrong speakers. So I want this to be like, while it's going up, it should go further up and all the way up. It should like lose velocity, I think. So it should depend on both the current face angle pick and forward velocity. That's cool. Right back. I'm glad you enjoyed it. I'm going to make an analysis video like that for every course. And next is course two. And I think it's also going to be interesting. So now we can go forward and we up until the forward velocity is zero eventually. And which point the angle valve pitch needs to become zero. So how do we do that? It goes up, and then it needs to tip over again. So there needs to be a constant tipping force. Am I understanding this right? Is that the idea? Constant tipping force? Course two tempo. Course two on the water is also going to be an interesting analysis. I think where the analysis is going to fall apart is in course four, maybe. Because course four is weird. Maybe course six. Those courses are not very thought out. But course two should be good. I'm thinking about how this will work though. Do we have a constant tipping force? Maybe we do. Let's see how this works out. Do we set a gravity on this? I think we do. I think that's going to tip it over. I have no idea what you're saying. I think course six is pretty neat. The dino level, it is pretty neat. Yeah, the reason I'm going to do it for every course is because I want to have the videos done before the remix exists. Just so we have a better point to start from. It's going to be more time efficient that way and we care about time efficiency here. What the hell? Where did my paper plane go? Hell, the gravity just made it say bye bye. Fair enough. It just fell through the floor. C14 stands for course 14. And I know it says course 15 somewhere, but this is course 14. The beard goes crazy. I have no idea what my beard looks like. I'll be honest. Okay, plane is flying. Slightly in the wrong direction. Where are we going? What the hell? Howdy, I love to spend my time on YouTube. What's up, give it up. Glad you like it. My current YouTube plan is next video is going to be a video explaining how the VLJ works. So that's not super technical. Then the video after that is going to be talking about the fuck I'm even doing on my YouTube channel because I feel like a lot of people don't know and I think that's going to be an informative video. Then after that is going to be the demo thing. And then after that, I think we go back to super technical stuff. Oh no, Mario, watch out for the towers. Bro. Can't believe you would make a 9-11 joke in my channel. Do you do some off-stream work? I always do off-stream work. Could it mean that these two are just randomly an absolutely perfect balance? That would be crazy. Up to trick optimization video. I wonder what I'll do afterwards. There's definitely going to be a video about f3dx3 at some point. Maybe I'll make a video with the GBA Mario 64 guy. Maybe I'm sure there's plenty of stuff. Oh, right. I also have to do a review of the analog 3D. Unfortunately, that's going to have to take priority over everything, but I guess it's going to be a technical video too. I wouldn't say I was working with him to find the striker. It's more so he contacted me because I already said before that they were fakes and he was curious why I thought that and yeah, we have been talking in like a group chat, but I don't know. Most of that was just him being very panicky and like thinking his life is over, even though from basically day one, we kind of figured it was a faker. I think it's just well-designed, but no one knows how to use it. Or was it poorly designed? It takes more work than it should to get most out of it. I don't know. I have no idea how difficult other consoles are. Yo, what the fuck? I feel like that's not how they work. Just a crazy, crazy theory I have. This would certainly add to that. Yeah, exactly. I should just move the spawn point to up there. Okay, well, we're slowly getting there. For one, angle valve pitch is a much more important value than I had put it. Like, changing the acceleration by that much would be crazy. Is that the one that Sonic 3 ran on? I think a PlayStation port of Mario 64 would go hard. It just keeps going faster. I think this is the issue. CSI mission messed up? Yes. Knights, Panzer Dragon, Virtua Fighter. Never heard of a single one of those games. It's going faster. I think that's part of the issue here. It's just unstable. When am I getting my paper playing physics wrong? So we go up, we lose velocity, we get down, we gain velocity. But we should not be able to go further down than this way. That's going to be where some of the issue is. That's cool. Oh, you don't have perspective correction. That would do it. What is this shit song? But yeah, the whole Nintendo Impostor situation, I think was very funny. I'm going to move to spawn point so I can test this quicker. This is unparalleled, I guess. How much freedom does someone have to do this as a hobby? Like half an hour a day? That's enough to get meaningful progress done? Just going to take longer? I've always been a hater for people that are like, oh, I can't work on my R64 because I have school. Bitch, school is like six hours a day. You still are awake for 10 hours a day beyond that. You have all the time you want and you're just being a pussy. So forward belt should never be able to go below zero. I'm sure it doesn't take that much time either. If this said GPT generate a few emails that sound like a lawyer wrote them. Okay, this is not going as planned. How does it look if we just remove this whole tipping thing? Why is the paperline even spinning so fast? Because of the code that I wrote! What kind of question is that? Oh, interesting, it does that even without the tipping. So, the angular patch goes way rogue. To bench PR, I did hit a 315 and then I didn't push further, but the 315 felt somewhat easy, so I can probably do like 330. Okay that's a little better. I think the issue is that this shouldn't be able to go beyond 0x3000, but if it can't go beyond that, then how do we tip back? Why would you make it spin like that? It's not very realistic. Oh really? You think this is maybe not intended? Are you trolling me? What is this? It's a development stream, this is not the finished product. You're currently working on tweaking the parameters so that it makes sense. I am being trolled, right? I think the issue lies in the angular pitch being scaled with just the y-velocity, where in reality it should be scaled with the rotation relative to the pitch, right? Although the y-velocity is already scaled from the forward velocity, so it's like, eh? Maybe it should be something like the sine of the pitch multiplied by two? I think this could work, because like, think about it, when the pitch is 90 degrees, then we are at zero again, right? Because like the whole flat surface of it is pushed against it. Maybe even 2.5. Where I come from, ping pong planes do not do backflips. Oh, it's for difficulty. For someone you shouldn't say you're doing so well, great job. You should talk crap to them so they push harder. What the hell, how is it still doing that? Is it because I'm doing it like too fast? What if I slow this down a lot? Because I feel like it might start rotating and then get pushed beyond the point of no return too fast. Hmm, that was definitely a lot better. Maybe I can turn it down even further and then it will suddenly work. What if, additionally, I make the angle of our pitch have some friction and then it will work better? Yeah, it should probably have some friction. Is this a function, right? It is. Can't you just stop? Yeah, sure. I can just remove the spinning, but then the paper plane is just going in a straight line and that would be really boring. That's not how we want the paper plane to move. We want it to move like a real paper plane. We want it to go swoop, swoop, you know what I mean? But it does not gain new velocity once it does that. So this is not what we want. So there's an issue of it not gaining forward velocity once it's done this. But once it's done this, it should hit back forward, which this does not do. Why does it not do that? Use pitch. It becomes zero. Maybe I do need this back here. And then we have everything we need. All the building blocks are in place. Oh, my God, there's people upstairs and they're making noises. Okay, it's pointing forward, but it's not gaining velocity. Yeah, that's for sure the issue. Why would it not gain velocity here? That's weird, right? We lose velocity when we point up, which makes sense. Then we don't gain velocity when we point down. Okay, again, that's literally just a submission. Can you make the velocity go in the direction of the rotation of the beaverman? Yes, it does. That's what this code here does. It's zero from the get-go, then how do we slow down at all? That makes no sense to me. Do we slow down from gravity? Is this all gravity? What if I remove the gravity component? There's no maximum velocity. Okay, guys, you are asking way too many questions about the feature that's not even done yet that I just started programming on. That's like a physics simulation that will take a little bit to program. The answer to every single one of your questions so far is just shut up and wait. When we do have Nintendo 3D DMC, I guess, like, by chance? I don't know. M4C. Okay, it's always M4C. That is very good to know. Oh, that's the issue. It was a random value on stack that we used.  Look, GTM, when you're getting asked too many stupid questions, you just have to be rude. Okay, okay, we're pointing down. The velocity gain is changing as intended. And then slowly, we should start gaining velocity again. And after a bit, it should point up again. Oh, nope, it keeps spinning forward. That is an issue. All right, but you guys are now starting to understand the idea, right? I hope you do. YouTube is pink. Cool. Okay. The pitch should then increase with the forward velocity too, I think. The problem here is that once the pitch was like this, it went down. And it just kept going down. Which it should not. Case, I thought we were doing backflips. Why is it all moving like a papyr plane? At the start of the stream, there were backflips. Why did you stop doing that? Okay, I split one case because I don't see the plane flying as you wanted to. Case, why did you remove the backflips? You wanted the backflips. Okay. You know, I thought what made you insane when you rommake is like the rommaking itself. But no, it's Twitch chat like watching you rommake. I have never tried the backflip GTM. I don't want to break my neck, you know. Okay. Okay, next question is why does it do this thing where once it's turned down? Okay, no longer. It's because it's always going up. What if we do SI of this? Is that roughly what we want? Yes, I think so. Actually, well, maybe. Well, we'll just see what happens. We just kind of need to fudge the equations in a way that we get the result we want. This is definitely not what we want. But he should slowly pick up velocity again. Okay. Can we turn around, please? I can't see the angle variable still there. So I see that he keeps spinning forward right now. Cool. Okay, different idea. Something like that. There's also the issue that for so long, he is at zero forward velocity, which is weird. Because the used pitch shouldn't be that big. Okay, so get this. I do not want to. Hello, Skyloft. I'm in last place because Wu is a douchebag. Oh, the new Maori party. I'm looking forward to playing them for the first time. I have not done that yet. It's going to be fun, I think. Hmm. Why do we spend so much time with zero velocity? It just shouldn't be like that. Unless used pitch was already 0x400, which it should not be, right? It's zero. It should be zero velocity again. 0x400 or well, 0x3800. It should be the absolute maximum. Wait, when it's here, it should be zero. But then where do we lose velocity? Nowhere. Let me look at this again. Why do you need more AI programming for time efficiency? Because AI is horrendous at programming at the moment. It's not going to be able to figure any of this out. Yeah, so it does snap and then it turns way too slowly. I think that's the issue, that it turns too slowly forwards again. If it did this way faster, I think we would get the good result. And then this is still well gain zero. But then in reality, it should already be something. So used pitch should not be used here. It should only be used for this part. Because phase angle pitch is used here. Okay. Then we had the issue that the angle pitch changed just way too slowly, which I guess is this variable here. Probably going to go back to backflips, but we'll see. You don't actually get the stars though, do you? No, AI can't even produce bad ones tech demos anymore. AI used to be better at programming, but at the moment it is absolutely horrendous. Oh, this is kind of nice. I mean, it's not perfect yet. What do you think? Should we add the backflips back? Now that we're this far, maybe backflips time. All right. I think I have to make the rotation a little more unstable. What about frontflips this time? We already had frontflips. That made it more stable somehow. Ah! That is crazy. Oh! Wait a second. Is this how much we flip forward? Oh, that is how much we flip forward. Oh, interesting. Okay. Wait, that doesn't make any sense. This is the variable you want to go crazy on as well. And then I think now we've got something. Hello, Raptors. Hello, Clayman. There we go. Yeah. Yeah, it's just taking too long to spin like that. This is the awkward part. That should be possible to go by faster. And this is gonna be a little bit crazy now, but I want to see how this goes. Yeah, we need to tip to drop faster. Oh, that is not at all what I wanted. Wait, so is there no force tipping it forward? Other than this? Surely that can't be right. Well, let's just turn the fuck out of that value. Okay, well, that did something. So do you guys want to see a review of the Analogue 3D, the new fake N64 console they just released? I'm hoping to get my hands on like an early copy so I can do a proper review, but it doesn't look like they'll give me one, which is very unfortunate, because if I was able to drop the video on release of the Analogue 3D, that would be perfect. The hack count for Star Road, any reason why you shouldn't, most of them are kind of crappy on N64 and you don't know which version of Star Road on N64 you're gonna get, so that's like a good reason not to. The Analogue 3D console is just a bit too pricey. It is very pricey, especially when you consider that you basically get the same result with just parallel N64, probably. I don't actually know yet. But my logic is, if they're not sending me a review copy or an early copy to review it, surely there's a reason for that. And surely that means it's garbage, right? Or they just think I'm too irrelevant. But I had like the top comment on that, so surely they would think, oh, our thing was really good, we'll send the thing to Case, so he can tell people about how great it is, because it's literally like a free advertisement to 300,000 people. This course has no name yet. We were thinking something like Handmade Heights, maybe? I mean, it looks somewhat realistic now. But I do want it to hit here. So we need to tweak these values in the way that it will hit there now. We need it to go exactly there. Well, we kind of removed most of the Alpha's items, but yeah, same course. Oh God, that made it worse. We could make it so that we gain more velocity at the beginning. That would change everything. Can't make hits. Does it mean my course 15? It doesn't matter. We already changed the course order before. Yeah, this stage does have different biomes, right? There's like the desert, the permits here, and then there's the mountains here with the Styrofoam, which right there. And then there is the castle here and the grasslands. It's your first stream. Welcome to the stream. Do not ask stupid questions. You will be made fun of. That's a nice introduction. Welcome to the stream. Don't get banned. Okay, so there's still an issue here. We have zero rendition of rainbow bullets. There is one. Can we steer? No. I could, of course, decrease or increase this value here, which will make the rotation a Which might be a good idea. Can I follow a path and start my new speed? Yes, I can. But no, this looks a lot better and it's cheaper. Or at least it would look a lot better if I didn't mess everything up. I don't like the F-Zero OST. I think one issue with this that I have is that it doesn't rotate far enough or fast enough. I can't listen to this. There's so many sound effects. Oh, my God. This isn't Splatoon 1, then. I'm fine with that. Sorry. All right, so we got a good base here. We just need to tweak the numbers a little bit. Does the new height thing mean the V of Cooper Carnival is now fixed? I have never looked at that. I don't know if it's fixed or not. Mars position on the plane does not affect this trajectory. Okay, so the main thing we notice is that this is too volatile, I think. Let's check how this would look if this was zero. Okay, that's even worse. But it's landing at roughly the right location. We also want to stop the whole movement once we are inside that thing. It's the idea that as soon as you touch the pyramid, it stops there. So this is a way to get up the pyramid. Okay, guys, no, stop interrogating me. Oh, God, that's even worse. How did I...  Was this the good configuration we had going on earlier? Oh. Nope, that's not it. So subtracting from Englewell pitch makes it go that way? That should make it go up, right? It probably went to crap because I changed the initial speed. Yeah, if you look at that at the beginning, it goes down a lot. But then later it doesn't anymore. So... The reason it goes down so much is probably because of this. So if we do that, I think it will do less of the down-dipping movement. But then also we need to somehow make Englewell pitch less volatile. There's a lot of numbers to fuck with. Hello, timing master. Oh, God. How did that happen? Because I increased the... Yeah, I see, I see, I see. So we probably want the rubber band to have a bit more force at the beginning. And then this is... That's fine. Let's try this. Used pitch, used pitch doesn't work. We had the issue that some forces were not there from the get-go. Oh, we're back to backflips. Fellas, we got exactly what we wanted. Are you happy now? Yeah. Alright, so we have... The issue is that some of the rotation forces are what's dependent on other forces. Like default velocity. I mean, obviously it's an approximation of real physics. This is just such a volatile, chaotic system. Should this be reduced depending on how much... Wait, isn't this the same as this, basically? Do we want this one at all? Yes, we kind of do. But this should be really low. I mean, that's what you wanted, true. That's why this is so difficult to work with. If you've ever shot a real paper airplane, you know exactly what I'm talking about. The lighting on it looks so good too, though. Holy shit. We're doing a Hovix right now. Okay, well... It just doesn't come back up anymore. Interesting. Why does it not come back up anymore? Because that number was a little... Shit.        We need this number to be high enough to overcome this here. Unless we make it so that this is only high if... It's already looking upward. That would make our entire life easier. Maybe we should do that. Fine. Hmm. Okay. It might be less realistic, but more workable. It's going straight up now. Oh, I see. This gets disinverted. That means this is a negative value, so... Just take the upside of it. Okay. Right, because now when we do the upside it's also going crazy when we're not going to search at all. So let's just take the negative version of it. Okay. That does not make sense to me. We have an angle of... Right, we need to add this. Surely it will work this time. Eh? It's doing something. And it's slowly turning the angle around, but the divisor is way too big. But it means the principle is working, I think. Okay. What made the divisor so big? We just never looked that way. Like an actual paper airplane now. You ever seen those shows where they just fly a paper airplane for like two hours, the competition, where it's about who can send it flying the longest? That's what this is. Okay. This is so weird. Is this just going to stop at 0x3000 now? Okay. That's how I envisioned this. What if I just put in a random lower number? I don't know why this... Damn. Fuck it, let's try it. Okay. Okay. Weird as fuck, but okay. Interesting. Okay. At this point, I'm just fucking with the numbers until I get something decent. I guess we've been doing that for a while. It's not losing velocity fast enough to tip forward again. That's the issue here. But we want it to tip forward. But making this depend on phase angle pitch was definitely the right call. Okay, uh, doesn't make any sense though. Yeah, I don't know. This is weird. Why did this not work? I should just print this. I didn't think that programming a paper plane was going to be this much of a problem. I didn't put this high enough to actually see it. I was just trying to center make some of my shuriken and isn't he a good guy? Fair enough. Okay. It's zero when it's here. It shouldn't be. Oh, actually it should be zero. I see. So just get stuck at this value. Okay, so the pitch acceleration should start earlier, but it needs to depend on face angle pitch. It probably shouldn't start at zero. It also shouldn't start at minus 0x300. It should probably start maybe around 0x800. And it also needs to be clamped at the top. Otherwise it's going to go crazy. Okay, so we're going to do something like this. It's path is fully scripted. Hello, John Trion. Okay, so that's what happens when you do that. I guess this needs to be the point at which we stop going downwards, which I guess makes more sense to be here. But then the right shift probably we want to increase that. Because dividing by 16 might not be enough. Yeah, because now we divide by too low of a number and that happens. Okay, we're now dividing by too much. No, that doesn't make any sense. Dividing by 256 seems like a lot though. I'm surprised we don't get back up so easily. Is it just because I have this number below? But wouldn't we then go up way too fast now? At the beginning. Yeah, as soon as we're above zero at all, it's just going crazy. Is it this piece here that's doing that? I think so. We're doing good. I was wondering, are the letters stretched because the game runs on widescreen? Yes. The game runs in like stretched 16 to 9, which causes that to happen. If you ran the game in native 16 to 9, which on emulator you can do, you can just run it in native 16 to 9, this would not be an issue. Okay, so that stabilizes the thing. It still goes too high up at the beginning, which I don't like at all. But if I don't reduce this, then we're never going to get back up. Right? What happens now? I like that. I don't like this. Shit. It goes up once and then it just goes down. Of course, I can pre-compute the animation. But even if I did pre-compute it, I would have to compute it once at least, and I'm doing that right now. Of course, I can just put it on a spline, but then I just have to add a spline and doing these computations, I prefer that. That's why there's some kind of physical basis for it. Even if I'm fudging the numbers and the physical basis a lot and approximating things. I know what we can do. We can add friction to this. Now with the friction added, it is going to go even, yes, but then it's going to go down because the forward velocity reduces, which changes the factor or the pitch and causes it to tip forward at some point. I was hoping it would tip forward earlier. It does change the angle eventually, you see that? How 715, 685, 715. Okay, that's weird. It seems to be just going one, one, one, one, one, one, one. Let's do more resistance, but also higher initial velocity. Really? I had my eyes closed. Okay, so the system is too stable. I don't like that. I'm guessing it stabilizes because forward velocity multiplied by flight of front rotation is exactly equal to pitch x. Like so. Or rather the other angle of pitch. What if we just add a stable factor to this? Like so. And then I think that can stay the same.  It's 15 and the theme slaps. Where do you have a course 15 theme? I actually don't remember. No, come up again. Man. So that was not the solution we were looking for. How is it still stable with all this? I really feel like it shouldn't be. What if you add gravity? How are we having so many 9-11 jokes this time around? Last time I made a 9-11 joke, people were very upset. I could reduce the velocity to a point where he just kind of does the schwoop schwoop once and then into the pyramid. I want him to come up once more though after that. This is lame. That's a boring flight. I don't want the flight path to look like that. Hey, what?      We have a very small version of this factor that previously made everything so unstable that it just didn't work. Hello, Biobak. Welcome to programming this and getting annoyed by chat. What else is new? Okay, again, too small. Sign wave on location, I'm changing it to another zoom. It would look decent enough, but it's not what I want. I want the full, like... Full broken up wave shape. I think maybe we need both of these fudge factors, or not even fudge factors, just like the chaotic factors to get the chaos back. Something just stabilizes at some point and then that happens. The 0x20 is kind of just a bullshit force coming out of nowhere. It's gonna work as intended eventually. Oh, that's better. There we go. That's a start. That's a start. 4.F of Velocity kind of makes sense, because 4 is the gravity in Mario 64 for everything. So that should be what looks the most realistic. Hey, that's good. That's some good shit. All right. Now we just needed to actually fly into the pyramids. Why is the text flashing? I have no idea. I don't see any flashing text. Guys, it's my birthday tomorrow. I might do a bonus stream for the birthday. The Kaze's birthday special. I'm gonna turn old. I'm not 30 yet, so I'm still alive and young, but soon. I think I can remove this again. So now we just need to slightly fudge the values in the way that it allows the plane to land on the pyramids. Oh, that would be perfect if it landed there. Wait. How did I invert the controls? Oh yeah, I didn't show you guys this, but I finished programming the paper targets off stream. You can now break them with Mario's face. They still need an animation. But it kind of works. I also added one more cannon to this level. Still young, that proves you make YouTube shorts. I don't make the YouTube shorts myself. Someone else does them. Have you seen the last YouTube short I uploaded? That's a banger. The classic toilet roll. The classic. The bro goes to the toilet, looks at the toilet paper and goes, oh man, that one's a classic. Remember this from my childhood, man. It's okay, I'll make the shorts. No. Let me just find the last shorts for you guys. This was the last short. Dude, the shorts on my channel are brain rot. Only 150 IQ can solve this. Wait, where's my favorite? This was my favorite. Top 10 Gooby Woobies. I don't trust that it compiles all the cons, it's Boris, that's what it defines. I don't know that it can't, but I don't trust that it can, you know what I mean? Okay we're gonna guess the exact time, like we're literally just gonna random fucking guess the time. I think that's the fastest way to do this. So like if, what time are we? We're just gonna do this. Alright, so that was too early. Um, actually, we don't need to do that, this is just faster. What do you mean 95 kill a minute? The short about how fuckable the dynamo is, you know what that reminds me of? The saddest thing about the Game Freak leaks is that Pokemon fans are gonna make the Typhlosion joke for the next 5 years and you already know. And it's like sure, Vaporeon, maybe it was funny for like the first 2 times you heard it, but like I heard it 20 times at this point and it's not funny anymore. And Typhlosion has also now already been like said 20 times in the last week and the comedic effect has seriously worn off. Yay, um, 210, so it's an 80. The funny thing is that we might hear less about the fucking Vaporeon. No, no, you're gonna hear more about it, I think. People are gonna be like the Gardevoir, Typhlosion, Vaporeon isn't that fucking funny. Fucking hilarious. Okay, we got close. I think 250 might be right. The unholy trio. Isn't there also the bunny Pokemon from Gen 4? Okay, we might be off by a single frame here. Next is, um, will we shoot Mario forward when this happens? Because it would be kind of funny to see Mario fly forward, but also it kind of would make this more difficult to do. I think that's perfect. Is the bot calling the path of back saturation? As in Game Freak pissed the cattle and Pokemon fans on the bot? Yes. Okay, next one. Press the function codes, blink and then disappear. Wait, then blink. I think this is going better than the Styrofoam texture stream. Yeah, honestly, I don't remember the Styrofoam texture stream. I often get very, very annoyed at chat when they just ask really stupid questions. But it is what it is, man. What can I do, really? I do kind of feel bad about making fun of the guy asking why I want the plane to do backflips and that real paper planes don't do backflips. But at the same time, I'm not sure if he was trolling. I do kind of really like streaming. It's just that sometimes I just can't deal with it, I think. So this can only happen if Mario is far enough away from home. Yeah, they're crazy like that. I don't think playing an instrument is a party trick, but most of us are playing an instrument so they can get into bed if someone can't. I see. I mean, if you're having fun with it, that's also good. Wee. Social media accounts for R2-D2. It's an interesting idea. I feel like I do all my marketing over my main account, right? I don't know, wouldn't it be kind of bad, marketing-wise, if I just restarted it now? Doesn't it make more sense to use my real personal account? It does respawn. Blame them. That's what I'm doing right now. There it is. That's true. I feel like if we do a real game, that's where we should make a separate social media account and then I can still post garbage on my main accounts and advertise the social media account at the same time. I think that makes a little more sense. Damn, you betrayed your friend like that through a paper. I blame that on him. Shame on you. I bet he's still crying about the betrayal. I kind of want the plane to land just a little bit higher. And I'm going to do this very sneakily. I'm just going to do... No. I'm just going to do that. But is that valuable, though? Wouldn't make more sense than for the non-Mario people. I just keep mentioning my game whenever I make a video. I'm like, oh, yeah, I'm making a game, by the way. Let's check it out. Posting garbage. Oh, no, by posting garbage, I mean like, you know, my YouTube channel. I have programmed it, by the way, so that if you do it with too little speeds, it will fail. What was that? What the hell? Okay, so immediately pressing A out of a cannon leads to a bug. That's good to know. Pressing A on the first frame bugs me. Is this vanilla Mario 64? Or just my game? Either way, the Paper Airplane is done. That finishes the target mission. Is it Mario 64? Oh. Interesting. No, if you don't press anything in the app, that works. I have tried that earlier. I have run into this bug before. And it was awful, so I pressed it immediately. So now I feel comfortable saying it. It's only there if you press it on the first frame or maybe the first two frames or whatever. So I didn't add the Totodile here yet. Let's import the Totodile. This is what all the NPCs in this level look like.  Wait. Here. Standing in front of the pressure system? That's good. The demo is all done, by the way. I fixed all the N64 bugs. I can show you real quick. I did some really cool stuff, too. Nope, they don't billboard. Just cardboard cutouts. Let me show you what I did here on the N64. I have not fully tested the demo and console yet. I'm still gonna do that. Just to make sure it's all fine. Probably gonna make a video of just me playing through it. But yeah. You see, we now have this. So what I recently fixed is the anti-aliasing options. You turn it off, you almost get 50 FPS here. And this works correctly.  You see, the lines are gone here. There used to be a line through that. That's because of some coverage multiplied by alpha thing. The background is correct now. Oh, there's actually one Z ordering issue there.  Oh, there's one Z ordering issue there, too. No! Okay, but that side is fine now. Okay. Which code would I show it? It's just gonna say I don't know how to do that. It's actually just gonna give you terrible tips on how to do that yourself. That are not gonna work. Fix the offset texture in the retro world. The offset textures are Glidenbug. I can show you. It's gonna look fine on N64. See how this is on the ground now. No, it's not offset here. It's a Glidenbug. Okay. That looks very flickery. Still looks very flickery. Still does. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think that's easily fixable. Does this look weird to anyone else? Is this how white Mario usually is? Oh wait, I just turned widescreen on. No wonder it's weird. So Specter, if you have more anti-aliasing levels, you mean more... Mid-map levels. The problem is Fast64 currently only supports two mid-map levels. So the only way to do that is to program the display list by hand. And maybe once Fast64 supports that I will, but at the moment I won't. Also, this whole area is basically 60fps. Isn't that nice? Did you see how good the HUD looks like on N64? Someone was saying, but hey, so how does the HUD look on N64? This is how it looks. It's beautiful. This is how it looks. Deka, what do you mean by higher anti-aliasing? Anti-aliasing is an on-off thing. You can't put it to like anti-aliasing 2. You can't put it to like anti-aliasing 2. I think you mean mid-map levels, in which case what I said earlier applies. R6 winners can't do it right now. The N64 can do like 7 levels on mid-map, but R64 can't do it yet. So we'd have to write the displace by hand, which would just make development way too complicated. You'd have to re-insert that every time you export a level, and I just don't want to deal with that. Hog 2, I think. Thank you. Oh, that was a weird transition. Oh, well. Is there a rumble pack support? Nope, I don't have a rumble pack. So I can't actually test it. It's multiplying the resolution with a vector, and then the real pixels are a shade of multiple natural ones? No, that's not what anti-aliasing is. Anti-aliasing is when you smoothen the harsh edges. Did you have any ideas moving to another game after the mod is finished? Yes, I will make my own game. I keep mixing up obj's default and obj's level. We're running at a higher resolution, I don't see it. No, anti-aliasing is usually a per-polygon effect, it's nothing to do with textures. What you're describing is one way to kind of make anti-aliasing work in Photoshop, but it's nothing to do with what I did here. You're thinking of mipmap levels. Mipmap levels is like a lower resolution version of the texture, that you can swap it with a further way, that kind of reduces the flickering. No, it will be a modded game in Unreal Engine 5. Most likely. Unless I make my own engine or something. Also not completely off the table, but I kind of want something practical, so eh. What do you mean I'm guilted? Hmm. This is what I want. No, mipmap is the only thing that works. Anti-aliasing, as you described, it's not a thing. That's the issue here. So this is what you made from now on your 8 month old YouTube video? I have no idea what was 8 months ago. I don't even know what I had for dinner yesterday. I think Unreal is better in Unity. Oh. Well, I think most of them are bloated pieces of shit. It's just that Unreal is more practical, because I already know how it works. Obviously, it will be a 3D platformer. I don't think I expected anything else here. I mean, we are constantly inventing new things. So of course, a few things are going to change. I don't know which strategies I presented back then, but there's stuff now like F3DX3 is in the game, which is a little faster than all the microcodes that existed back then. So it's not going to allow for new stuff, especially the occlusion plane is going to kind of change how stuff works and the triangle fence and triangle strips. But that's more of a performance thing than an art style thing. But like, I guess the art style is very much influenced by the limitations you have. So another thing you could bring up, it's also fast on the RSP. And my game now is RSP bottlenecked. So that's a thing to bring up. So he needs to spawn a star and he should spawn the star right above Mario, if you ask me. Let me check how that totem mission goes. Hello Zena, what are you doing? We just did the paper airplane. Look at it. We still need to program the slingshot to actually sling Mario. Me too Fire Phoenix. I mean, it makes sense, right? I mean, this is a pure fun platformer game. It's kind of exactly what many people want that you're not really getting anymore. I think the bar for 3D platformers is so incredibly low that making a 3D platformer is easy at this point. I always bring up Battle for Bikini Bottom. That game is so nothing. There's nothing good in the game. But there's also nothing bad in the game. And on top of that, you get funny SpongeBob character interactions. So the lack of bad stuff with just the presence of a small bit of good stuff already makes it a fan favorite for many. In the same way, if you just make a hack or make a game that doesn't suck, I think it's going to be popular. That's my theory on the matter. Oh, that's a thing that can happen. I didn't even realize that. Oh, that is evil. That can't stay like that. That is evil. Holy shit. He has to go here. Can you just kick up the pyramid? No. Silly kick doesn't work in this game. I'm sure you can go up the pyramid, though. It's just not that easily. Oh, there he is. He looks kind of cool. Oh, he doesn't compute the angle to Mario, of course. What? I don't know if I have played Bob-Omb in Hero. Is that the N64 game where it's like you have to beat a bunch of plots? I played a little bit of that. Yes, this is a universal experience. Or am I the only one who is seeing the hawk to a girl in my reels, explaining like integration and math theorems? Imagine if this was made by another. Can you believe what would happen? Actually, that wasn't actually meant to be minus 150. Also, Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast is in those, too. I love that it's just one channel. You. Dude, the toad is so happy. I like this. I'm going to make him a little more animated. Isn't he way too large? I like that he's so large. I think it's fitting. Actually, I like the animations to say no, but I think there should be an animation for when he gives you the star. Oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I also like the little callback here to your princess in the castle. Because Toad is in the castle. I think that counts as a reference. No star? No star. I think I need to change this. There was another change I wanted to do, but I forgot what it was. Right, the text. This is bperm4 plus 256. Sometimes I feel like I got stupid and then I look at this and I think... 176. Yes, that works. It should not have taken that long, though. Hmm. Thanks for visiting me. I want them to be kind of mechanical. No, Analog Freddy never replied to me. See, I have this theory that if they don't respond to me, it's probably because the console is bad. And they don't want me to reply to people. That's what I'm saying. The pressure they need to send me one. I don't even mind paying for it. I just want it early so I can review it. I always wake up at the same time, which is 8 o'clock. Conker's Bad Freddy at the best platformer is fucking crazy. Conker's Bad Freddy shouldn't even have been a game. It should have been like a movie. Or like a clip show. It should have been a bunch of YouTube shorts. Let's be real. Okay, I'm making him sound mechanical. Hmm. Hmm. I want to see what Chachapiti thinks mechanical is like. Maybe that's an idea. Maybe it should sound more mechanical. Visitor detected, dispensing star. Take it. Okay, that's shit. That sounds like it's a machine. No, that sounds like he's in a machine. Supposed to sound soulless. Thanks for stopping by. Here's your star. Hey. What if I just remove the exclusion marks? Well, your week's gonna be happy because you wake up at different times. If you wake up at the same time every day, you can get like a good amount of sleep. And then your week won't be as heavy. Ever thought about it? That way. I forgot to set the beat for him. And he still didn't give me the star. I don't see how this wouldn't work. Previous action should be action talking. And now it's no longer action talking. I can just make a variable on stack for this, but if I can write that, I will. Yeah, it's set here. This doesn't make a difference, but actually I don't even need to add anything. Is that the fat guy from GTA going? Yes, that's how the Wild West NPCs talk. Is that a chat GPT generated comment in my chat? Wild NPC talking? What is this? Why are you saying that? Maybe Clayman? Oh, there we go. I did get the star. So it was working, I was just not waiting long enough. Perfect. I'm just making sure I don't get two stars. Shit. Right, because this is why I need a low opacity. All right, we got the toad working. Next is the crayon star. Okay, this one's going to be a bit more action. We should do the rubber band next. The question is, what is our best option for animating the rubber bands? So this rubber band needs to fly forward to match the visuals here. Maybe our easiest option would be to just add an animation bone here and have this fly forward like that. Actually, yeah, that's almost definitely the easiest way to do it. Then it just flings back. Yes. Oh, hello, Snooplex. Welcome to the stream. Oh, there's a problem here, and that is that the way it's rotated, I don't like it. I think we can make it work anyway. It's fine that it's rotated. It's the same sound effect like Mario's had on Mario 64. That would be very fitting. Is that a paper toad? Yes. Nope, no idea what that is. You guys keep forgetting that I'm just like a caveman that just sits here and makes video games. I have not played Splatoon. I have a bad idea for this. I have also not beaten Shadows on Chess. I actually hate chess. I have played chess before and I hate it because of that. Oh, Bollywood video is also a thing that I've never heard of. I see. So we do know that it takes six frames for the paper plane to shoot off. Seven, actually. So after seven frames, this should be all the way forward. Just to make animating this easier, I'm going to put myself a helper line here. So on frame seven, it should be like here. You know what? You know what? What the fuck? That's not very elastic. It doesn't bounce at all. I thought. Huh. I mean, that's kind of nice, but like not enough force. Can you anyone know if in Blender you can change this somehow? Isn't there a way to, like, look at curves? You have to make bones forward. What does that mean? You actually notice you're just saying words. Sometimes someone just says words, so I don't want to accuse you of that. Like, what do you mean by bones forward? There's no bones forward line here. I don't know, cream teamer. I wonder what else there is here. I can change the easing mode. No. Hmm. I mean, I think this looks somewhat realistic, but like not quite what I want. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think this should be on this side here. And this should be on this side. And that's the final position.  So this jitter was too strong. That part is good. This part is good. That is too fast and too far. And then this is. Okay. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh my god. What did I just put this back to? Xenozoidal. Why did that not work? And there we go. It's just so weird. There we go. That's kind of nicer. Let's try that. Yeah. I wish I knew how. But I can't read anything in here. Oh, because the values are so high up. Oh my god.   That's why I can't see anything. Oh my god. Oh my god. I can't add a curve like this. I have no idea how it works right now. But it's technically fine because I'm not the animator for this game anyway. Really, I just need a decent base so that we can make this work. How much is more than one mess child? Right. I don't know. Let's try this. Can the music be one or two dots louder? I'm just asking. What are you thinking? It is possible. Try coding over Photoshop. I hate Photoshop. I don't know how to use Photoshop. I don't know how to use Photoshop. I don't know. I haven't updated Photoshop since 2014. I have no thoughts on Photoshop nowadays. You guys always have the wildest questions for me. You guys always have the wildest questions for me. Okay. I still don't find it insane that anyone actually cares about Asmongold. He's just the guy that shows up if you look for literally anything on YouTube and don't have to blog yet. It's like you watch a YouTube video and there's a guy watching it with you and that's the I don't think they're looking at Asmongold as a girl. I think they just I have actually I can't imagine why I think they just want to watch the video that he's reacting to and he just happens to show up higher on the algorithm That has to be what's going on, right? Yeah, me too infinity until I block the channel same with um Critical. It's like all YouTube slop is like that. I think it's just because They keep people long on the website YouTube likes them because like many people just have a sloppy talking video on the site while they do anything something they don't actually want to watch something that just kind of keeps their brain semi-busy and I think that's what's going on here Well, I should not be saying that as a streamer In the end you guys are gonna realize and just stop watching don't be sad Those are the whatever podcast they did that's when I was a personal runner Oh, that's the one where they get woman on the show and then tell the woman she's stupid What an insane concept  Okay, well that didn't work at all that was atrocious what happened there That was the rubber band behavior, right? Americans that must be I don't know why maybe you just Managed to not watch it for so long that they realized you're not gonna what? What do you want your boyfriend to have Oh, no, only two percent of men in america have what you want your boyfriend to have like, yeah cool Now what does it mean anything? There's so much more to it. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know   Oh, they also talk about the men or bear thing all the time, I didn't even know that So Really funny insult shit on instagram and that's like The channels analyzing henry pebbles negative cancel tilt dude that shit goes. Sorry That's good youtube content or instagram content I'm not brain rotten enough to know those people infinity I See the animation was missing He was just using mario's animation and that's why that happened That's better Um, but the animation doesn't go yet Interesting Anything another push-up stream challenge Another challenge of like playing a romhack and every time I die I have to like bench 300 pounds I mean, that could be fun The problem is there is no game worth playing right now What do you mean by the word should when you say that zelda during coding I just started coding Probably resistant woman shouldn't but why do you care though? Anyone can go in the internet and say anything stupid question is why do you care? You Can't stop them from saying that but you can't stop yourself from caring and then no one's gonna hear them say that anymore  Let me just print this see what happens So You're gonna search something on the sites and sometimes you want to search for other reason well I think it's such a pretty thing Look in all the old youtube. You can use photographing. It's a good remote for this off court case You can't do that Okay, but you haven't explained what you mean by the word should Ha the animation goes but nothing happens so that means Why is there two animated parts Oh Oh, I see I messed up Absolutely my fault and not for 64s This is what should have happened Usually when you first become lifeless slope division really slowly increasing and that's the problem Okay, but wasn't the idea to be like very animated slope at the beginning So now you don't like it because they're too high quality Am I understanding this, right? I mean that's enough So Okay, that's weird it looks like It's like unframed Oh at the beginning, which it really shouldn't be unless The execution order of these was wrong That's probably what's going on If it's the execution order I should um Just implement this here So So If you don't have your search results already communicated you can block stuff Will you work out your jaw no should I I mean I eat food does that count How do you work on your jaw Eat rocks for a good workout I haven't done that before You're being carried I am oh that lets you absorb the microplastics too that's awesome So So No, you have to absorb the microplastic by eating the tire, oh you have to eat the whole tire Your breathing and meowing patterns can help to influence your breathing So PSG oh, I think i've heard this before This is some looks maxing term I think I Seen it before and they showed like he's drawn the indian dudes and then That said like virgin and then they showed like the same indian dude But like he had big muscles and like a big jaw And I think it said psg got on that I don't know what psg means So Okay, what if What if this just fucking sucks and that's why it's like that So what if we have to do this and this is actually a fast 64 buck? That is probably what's going on What the fuck What if the bug is that I have to apply this twice that would be very dumb but who knows Nope what the hell is going on? We measured this out perfectly we know this is exactly where it should be how can it be wrong? They're all around zero also also also I really shouldn't forget this Let's Lead an inline materials, please Surely it actually does start at animation frame one, right? It's just like a smart animation range bug Where because there's no frame before the first one that just doesn't start here Oh, that would suck. I would call clean up for that I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know If it works now we can cook lila, oh time to cook lila Airfryer or a pan That's a tough one So I don't know. I don't cook I am so cooked So I don't know what my shirt says. I don't buy clothes It's a little bit slower So Sometimes the easing is importing over No, the first animation frame wasn't exporting because there's a smart animation range feature That cuts out all the frames until the first one. We have a keyframe on So because of that because I didn't have a keyframe before the first frame. I just cut the first frame So All right, what do you think of my rubber bands I like it It looks very smooth We're gonna put a yoshi doodle here and he's gonna tell you something I don't know what he's gonna do We It's faster than the plane. Yeah I'm I think the bounce easing just isn't working  I'll just manually make a bounce like that Uh, the threes there to symbolize where the paper comes from I don't see any threes Oh That's the same speed now the trees are there to symbolize trees they're supposed to look like trees Hello, thank you Oh my god, that's so smooth I obviously still need sound effects. But for now, I really like it All right, I mean we got the toad in and we got the plane in that's good progress for today Um, so I will see you guys in the next stream because i'm feeling done for today next stream probably tomorrow And then maybe after that tuesday Until then. Bye. Bye
