Hello. It's a bit so we'll take are you sick both I am incredibly sick today I was so sick today yesterday I vomited like six times before it was 10 a.m. it is pretty bad or waste my time I lost hope in doctors oh yeah look at the new ice effect you guys like it remember the last time I worked on this so I think part one was done right we have this there's supposed to be a cannon here but that's we get there when we get there I don't know any of them let's see what did we settle on ah here hello Keaton hello so seldom music is a bit too loud all right let me turn it down like white on rice interesting they want some tea maybe maybe that would help and we have our ghostly boardwalk here that's good you have the zoo entrance that's also good I think that's all right hello Syrian rule did you guys know that up until like the 20th century going to a doctor was actually more dangerous than not going to a doctor they just make your issues worse fun fact and changed up if if if if if  if if if I don't like how surface aligned that was. Alright I think we can start working on part 2 then, since part 1 and part 3's outline is done. Part 2 is going to be the connection between part 1 and part 3, so it's going to be between here. Let me get the ball back right here. We want this to be mostly between cliffs. This is our reference images for that. Use the enemy here. And this, yes. I think it has potential. So...  Shit I need Photoshop for this. Right, we have the Bowser 1 entrance and the course 3 entrance here, I remember. Today I will probably be working a little slow, just because I am so sick. You guys will just have to deal with that. I got cooties from Zayna. It's sad, but it's true. It's true. I feel like this is a little small for the area. Oh well. We'll figure something out. Okay. I can't stay because hashtag employed, but get well soon, thank you. I mean Zayna got over hers in like 3 days basically, so I can probably do it in 2. But the first day was absolutely miserable. I had a pulsating headache, or whatever you call it, that made it so I can't sleep. And then because I couldn't sleep, I felt like shit all day. And I was puking so much. Okay. Wait, this is what I want. So a kitty, true. Perfect for the zoo. Intentional of course. Hello Biobak. Is there a Mrs. Case to take care of you when you're sick? Yeah. Zayna made soup and tea.  Biobak. I recently took a sponsor deal with Squarespace. And they're asking me to make 6 videos in 3 months. And I'm just going to make a video about each actor rework. Like fuck it. It's way too much money to not take it. Trumpets solo kind of a day? Yep. You're going to get very famous because I'm going to keep mentioning you. During all the actor reworks. You missed it, you got an ad. Basically, I took a sponsor deal with Squarespace. And they want me to make 6 videos in 3 months. Which is a lot of videos. So I'm thinking, I'm just going to say fuck it. And make a video about every single actor rework. Like one video per rework. Because that's such easy content to make. And it's way too much money to pass up on. So I'm going to mention you a lot and you're going to become famous. You will hear me? Thank you Daily Delphox. Does Delphox learn Heal Bell? What is this? Twitch stream. Twitch stream. Twitch stream. Twitch stream. Twitch stream. Twitch stream. Blender and Visual Studio. Twitch stream. Okay, that works. You will be able to just download this game for free. I can't charge for this because it's not my IP. I'm half hoping Nintendo shuts me down. So I have to exchange all the assets for non-Nintendo assets. So I can actually sell it. Are you that famous elsewhere? I guess you are famous in the Binding of Isaac community. I guess you translated the game. I guess Isaac people. You know what? This island isn't Yoshi-shaped at all. It's not even close to Yoshi-shaped. I am reading YouTube chat, yes. Hello, Rick Luton. Completely misshaping Yoshi as an enemy. As you can see, this island is technically like a Yoshi. It's fine. The island doesn't need to be shaped like a Yoshi. It was just a random idea anyway. It doesn't really do anything for this island to be shaped like a Yoshi. I mean, I guess it's still going to be vaguely Yoshi-shaped, so good enough. I'm scared that it's not going to be aligned to the axis if I do that. But yeah, I know what you mean. Now I know what I thought about making a SNES game. I'm not a fan of 2D games in general. SNES doesn't have an analog stick. That's a dealbreaker for me. Yeah, but I wasn't an orthographic viewer. Oh, there's a bunch of out-of-bounds secrets that we'll see if anyone notices. So let's see. Okay, so there has to be a bridge to part 5 here. You know what, I don't think you should be paying him. I think it should just be open right away. Because as soon as you free him, it's going to be impaired. Or maybe not. Maybe this is a stupid way of doing it. Let me show you my dilemma. So the first of all part is everything to the left of this island here. I added a purple line here. It's where you can go before you beat the first Bowser level. So, after beating the first Bowser level, the island is full of Yoshis again. And you can go to the second overworld part here. The problem is, how do we close off this? Now the initial idea was, there'd just be a Yoshi here that repairs the bridge. So you can walk over the bridge. But now that I'm reading it again, I'm not liking it. Why don't you like the bridge idea? Well, like, Yoshis aren't really known for repairing bridges. And it also says in the notes that we'd have to pay him 100 coins to repair it. And it's also like, okay, you just saved him and now he wants money from you. This feels like a decent length for it. Hello Jerita. Camera is here. I want it to be here. So... 157, just like C7 maybe? I don't know. I did K-Lab, I didn't respond to all of them yet. I'll probably invite you though. To the beta testing discord. Yeah, the next part is the part where the Yoshis live for the most part. So that's where you'd find the village of Yoshis. Shh. This is indeed the red zone you can't go as deep.  I have tried Unity. I've made like a simple character in Unity before. I was, a long time ago I was thinking of making a game in Unity but... Obviously not anymore after what I did.  The fog is long gone. So I think we want this to be mostly like platforming above stuff. Now I have a bit of a problem with letting the player fall down here. New World is not supposed to be like a dangerous place. Hmm. And then this should be cliffs and then eventually trees. Yeah, I'm kinda immune to roots. I don't even notice when I'm, or someone else's roots. At least it creates a bubble for Mario to float up to an entrance in Area 2. No. That's way too weird. Definitely not what I would want. Remaking Mario 64 in Unity should be pretty simple. That would be a much better PC port than the PC port we have right now. I don't know. That is an interesting idea. Really I think the difficult part for me is that I want the feeling of like this but without the platforming difficulty of this. I don't want the player to fall down here. I'm not sure if water really is the solution because this is the middle of the island, right? This should be like dry land. What's wrong with the PC port? The render is extremely inefficient. PC port is basically just a proof of concept that a PC port is possible and not something made to be like well made. Just like GoNuckets possible. Isn't that cool? If you hate math, you're not gonna like programming. What if there was like a lake here? I think it would be a lot easier to make work. Oh yeah, illegal ROM sales out of my garage. That sounds like a great idea. Okay. I can bench three plates for another 15 pounds. That's just 240 on there. I really hate math. I just feel like it's strange theories. Did you guys hear about I think it was called Fermat's Last Theorem and how he had like a proof 300 years ago but he never wrote it down? And then like they remade the proof that couldn't possibly have made back then. But it's like man, if this guy just wrote it down, we'd be 300 years ahead. Sometimes I wonder if there's like random strikes of genius that led to some of the things we have rather than it just being a natural progression. Like one piece of tech is just 300 years ahead of another piece of tech that we have. I feel like microwaves were like that. I don't know how microwaves work, but microwaves are crazy. I'm very sick and cold, Keaton. Could optimize microwaves, probably. Microwaves are crazy though. I don't know how microwaves work, but microwaves are crazy. How do you distance it from legal IP problems? Oh, that's a medical message. I see. Game RT? Is it hot? It is hot. Oh no. Well, I am feeling better, at least voiceless. If it was like yesterday, it would be impossible. Yesterday I went to puke like every few minutes. I don't know where this idea that Nintendo cares whether you make money off of the thing or not came from. That seems like pure assumption to me. Because I had the most legal attention on me while I was not making money off of what I was doing. And now that I'm like probably the most legal attention on me, I don't know where that came from. If I'm not properly monetizing my YouTube channel, I feel like I get very little legal attention from Nintendo. I even have like a Patreon now. Wait for what? I need to hide this. It's pissing me off. So, I guess microwaves just vibrate with the same frequency that water's natural vibration would be at. Tree texture? Ah, this is just randomly. I put that in. All of these are placeholder. It's not supposed to look pretty. I have a dust and that's like pure coincidence. I just took the first thing that looked like a tree. I don't know. You know what's been annoying me? Maybe I'm just becoming a boomer. But when people say TS, I don't like it. It just doesn't flow naturally ever. My engine actually doesn't have invisible walls anymore. Unless there's legitimately no level boundary. So, I think I don't have to be careful anymore. I haven't hit invisible walls in months. It's because I reworked how Mario handles collision altogether. I think it may be possible. What does that tell you? I'm stealing the heart? He's just a bad guy like that. He's just a bad guy like that. PLJ patch, no it's not way too hot Generally I just like intuit how well it's gonna run Of course I test at some point on real hardware as well, but usually it's not an issue Imaginate Oh Oh Hey, where's the war what happened to my work Oh, I know this is correct That is weird Oh True the invisible walls. That's what shows you that power 64 had soul Unlike all these modern games without invisible walls no soul Oh Yes, it's the other one that's very sick not me I Still have a lot of you going shit. I forgot about that. Oh My god, bye like that's such a good idea. I Will just do that. Oh my god, that's the freest video ever That's gonna save me so much time, you know what I will do that I noted it down. I'm gonna program this later and then make the video Oh What would the video be Just the code that Shows every wall every collision triangle in the game goes through all the areas and levels And just records it. Yeah, I'm living in Canada Oh Actually one risk associated with that is That pen and coke might actually think like I'm trying to make fun of him No pan cooked at one about invisible walls Ah When the watch for rolling rocks Rakes a presses came out and people were making memes about it. He did not like that He thought people weren't taking his stuff serious, so he didn't I wasn't a fan of it I Mean technically we could import higher resolution textures for the heart on Emulator only I Might still do that at some point I Was I want so they can see they have been placed up by the developers It's a lot more in terms of all here's to the fact that you can see the wall since it has a texture You How does pen and coke's video go Right, you can't Google pen and coke as you will just find Dutch pancake recipes Wait, what the fuck I missed this video And this one or 64 is a visible wall that's explained once and for all I It's true Let me think a little bit more about this video so it would be It would probably be like a three-hour movie of just the game panning to every visible wall at Mario 64 And then maybe I would have a code that highlights the triangle for the visible wall Then goes for all the areas I did not look like that in blender Oh Let me think more about this video's concept So at first I get about what a visible wall is for like two minutes and Then I do my ad reads and then there's just three hours of visible walls I'll ask him I Asked panin, let's see what he says Still unclear you're referring to what no, I would just write a code that visualizes the triangle as it shows All right, let's think about what we need in here So the boss of an entrance needs to be around here and that's about us minds and But that there should be a minecart and I remember we had this whole big setup in the old overworld Let me get the old overworld actually So I think we still want to Bowser Mac. He's just too cool You Thought the older world is going to be a final one you thought completely wrong I Pan and coke said and do whatever you please. He doesn't care about it anymore. That's cool Although it looks a lot like a crayon. Yeah, right wait until it transforms Hello Nico I Isn't that right, I guess It's an enema data type It's Not supposed to be a crayon just what long why is the crayon called styrofoam It's gonna load in any day now I Know it's still loading. You see this icon here. Do you see my mouse cursor loading? No feedback from blender. Oh My god, it's gonna take forever Oh We got another beta tester for drug Mario Oh My god, why does it take so long what the hell dude? I Guess in the meantime while the blender file is loading. I can make sure that this still works the Mac Bowser He Does still work a look at them I feel like there should be two of those one on each side of the entrance True it is a lot like the children entrance Oh There we go That is a funny idea. I'll write that down. Hello Thomas, I'm glad you enjoyed. Yeah, take advantage of me while I'm sick. I really picked the ugliest textures ever when I first modelled this, huh? What do you plan to do after finishing this hack? I have no idea. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I could get Mario 64 to win 60 FPS. Well, maybe no Jolly Roger, but I can mod the rest pretty easily. Are commissions in the hundreds, what do you mean? I was thinking of opening a store for commission models because so many people ask me and I always forward them to Aesir, but if there was just one location where people could buy them and I could just forward most of them to Aesir, I think Aesir could make decent money. And then I only have to do small pieces of extra code. So. I actually don't like how difficult it is to read the sign. But I do like the little area he has here. Do we know how to import beta animations? I don't know where to get the beta animations. Why would importing beta animations be different than importing normal animations? Yeah, that's a good idea, Keaton. I think that makes sense thematically too, because this is a barrel. I think it needs to be facing like so. The first thing you see, I think that's good. How interesting, the old overworld did have an incline here. You can tell from these. Hello, Dakota. That's good. All right, yeah, now you see it instantly. That's good. The Bowser mechanic needs a flat place to sit on. So. So. Camera framing is difficult, because I don't want to take away camera control from the player. I want the player to have full freedom. But also I want the scenes to look cool. So we have to just naturally have it happen. I would say this works pretty well. Oops.  Oh, of course. I forgot my own rule. That's true.  It can be a little higher. Oh, you mean here. It's adjusting something like this. Yeah, definitely works. Yeah, me too. I like that it's a little hidden. It does hurt if you touch it, but you have to really try to touch it. Okay, yeah, I really hate the Yoshi bridge here. Even more now. One thing I kind of dislike about this is that it doesn't really go into the volcano anymore. I think I should just spin this whole part a little bit. Like so. So. I think that's a little bit better. Hello, Dimensio. I don't have a reason to use LibSM64. I don't like it. Or well, I don't trust it rather. Actually, I never used it. Do I need this rotation here? I see what you mean with the exploration backlog. I think maybe it is a bit questionable. But there's also the fact that you can't enter it right away, so you would see it and then later come back to it. So you need a certain amount of stars to get to there.  Yeah, I think that works. That's very well readable now. But we really, really need something better here. For entering part five. Really hate the bridge idea. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ No, I don't like Tetris in general. And I don't like that they added holding to Tetris. Tetris shouldn't have a hold button. Am I hot tech for the day? I know, Chris. But if the camera is different, then like already what's the point? And I already know when I can walk again when I can't. It's kind of like that one section in Jolly Roger Bay. I don't know why. That section is on my mind way too much. Is it a good section or do I just like it? You guys know what I mean, right? Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay.  Especially because I'm not going to have the same controller working and it's going to be all annoying like that. Okay. That's kind of crazy to me. Is that like, how much was it? Probably like half a year before Mario released. Wise guy made Mario, but didn't really market it. And then when Mario released, I was like, holy shit, that's portable Mario 64. It's like, man, you could have had all the clout. I guess probably don't even know that wise guy made that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, wouldn't really be accurate to say first overworld. There's just one overworld. It's not like a Mario 64. Mario 64, you can clearly define what the first, second and third overworld is, right? In this game, you can't. Okay.  Okay. True. Never forget to like and subscribe. Who's hacking for fame, pure passion and vibes? Yeah, but the more fame you have, the more people play your stuff. And that's cool. There's plenty of people that are hacking for clout now. Now that there's money in the game. Feels like something someone would say on a diss track. Like, oh, you're hacking for clout. Oh, you're hacking for clout. God, I hope Skelenium makes another video about me. They're so funny. All right. We need to think of a way out of spring. The Yoshis get you here. True, keep them. Okay. Can you just skip? Wait, what's stopping you from just skipping here? Can you just... Okay. Someone got to day 20 on Drug Wars Mario 64 just now. That is crazy. I thought no one would make it past day 8. For a while. Gamers live among us. Nintendo makes a Mario 64 Mecha, I will definitely make, like, one video about it or something. But... No. I will not be switching over. I mean, I made Mario 64 Mecha. Think about that. And then Roval and Arthur Tilly made Mario 64 Mecha. So now we have two Mario 64 Mechas. And then we'd have three. All right, let's think about this. So the Yoshis are free. What do Yoshis do in their free time? Not sure. The Yoshis are going to be all over the beaches now. And you'd see the Yoshis everywhere. Maybe after that there's going to be a cutscene of, like, the Yoshis coming out of the burrows and, like, cheering for you. I think that's the plan. Egg volleyball? True, they would do that in their free time. They sing campfire songs? True, actually. Wait. Isn't that what they literally do? Is that it? Oh no, that's just baby music. Okay, shit. How does that make us get over to part five? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Another overworld. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.   What other ways do we have to make progress later on in the overworlds here? Okay. Ah, the super happy tree sitting. Okay, that is a good one. I like that. Yeah, that doesn't work here. Something magical about the island that changes once there's more Yoshis would work, I think. Okay. You felt that? I felt that too. What a rough spot. Why would the Yoshis being back spawn the rafts in? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  What a talent. I think the overworld is going to be very cool in the end. Okay. But something about the island should change after you get all the Yoshis right. It has to be. So maybe it is a bridge that gets repaired. But paying someone for doing that kind of sucks. Showing a bridge getting repaired in the cutscene also kind of sucks. I do netmelt. What if there's a bunch of Yoshis swimming in the water and they help you up when you go near them? What if there's a Yoshi here that you can ride and then you can do his flutter jump to get over? We could just put a Yoshi there. We could put a Yoshi down here and he's like, wow, you saved us. I'll let you ride on my back. And then you just flutter jump over here. Because Yoshis can flutter jump. And then you'd be here in part five. It'd be as simple as that. That makes sense. What about Dory? I mean, would Dory come back just because you saved the Yoshis? How would Dory even get in here? We could have a Dory in here that doesn't trust you until the Yoshis are back. She is kind of a Yoshi. Pink Dory? Well, a Dory kinda works, like imagine if there's a Dory in here and she won't let you ride her at first, but then after you save the Yoshis, she is happy and lets you ride. Yeah Darkbeast, right now we're thinking about how to make the second Overworld accessible though, once you've beaten the first boss up. Are you saying the first boss is in this lake where they blow up the stone walls so you get a passage to the other side? No, I think we'll just have Yoshis in here that are now putting Dory in a good mood. Let me just write that down. Oh true, just having her chained up would be a lot better. Okay, how about this? So Dory chained to a wall in the lake. After beating the first Bowser, the Yoshi is on Dory's back. When you talk to him, he says he freed her from his mighty behind. You can write this in Dory. I think that's better. That makes the Yoshis be actors around the world too. So now they aren't just the helpless little guys, they're actually helping you. No, that doesn't work Zena, it has to be from saving the Yoshis that you can make progress. Oh yeah, I'm definitely going to put empty Yoshi homes around. If you look at the first overworld here, that's what we had back then. We had these huts here with no Yoshis in there. No, it's got to be Dory. Hello Monfeuille. Let's just make sure I can't skip to the second overworld. So I'm fully aware that Mario is a little creature. And people are going to find some sort of way to make it up there. That is an issue. Okay, that's better. That's true, they need Delphox. That wouldn't be so bad if the Yoshis were just eating the fruit. Still an overhang. No, you would still be able to do that. I mean my wife does like to play my games I think. No, I think I prefer just leaving it like this. If you find a way around it, be my guest. I don't want to put fake barriers there. But do you like playing my video games? Yeah, I want to leave the Warp Zones active. I'm not a fan of trying to prevent cheese that much. If you can get there, it should just work. Yeah, exactly. I don't want to be a bus kill. Yeah. Alright, we still need the entrance to Course 3 here. And then we have all the necessary elements. Yo, thank you for the 30 months never around. Holy shit, that's a long, long time. Very appreciated. This is not going to work right. It's gonna look so bad. I already know. But that is fine for now. I don't know what Yoshi Village is. It's supposed to be hinted at by that block, but I think that's kind of what it was here. No, I didn't study game development. Cool. That worked, by the way. That was not a not working clue, that's a working clue.  I think my next machine is also going to be Linux. I think studying game design is relatively pointless, because game design is such a new art that basically all the research that's been done on it so far amounts to basically nothing. It's like physics before the ancient Greeks, you know. Like, had you studied physics back in Egypt, in ancient Egypt, you wouldn't really have gotten very far. And I think studying game design is kind of in a similar spot. The matter of doing the research yourself, then trying to study it. A lot of game design is psychology, so just reading a lot of psychology also makes a lot of sense. It's a small subset of psychology. And this is where I chill my favorite book, thinking fast and slow, which has some very good insights into how to design games and abuse human biases and stuff. Ancient Egyptian physics, I mean, yeah, but didn't it take them like hundreds of years and a lot of slave labor? I mean, it's impressive the amount of suffering they were willing to do to get to it, but is it really impressive that they did it? At least it isn't here that game design principles are the best, or battle passes and birth patterns. Oh yeah, that too. But obviously, that's not what we're targeting here. Do you think volunteer playtests with slave labor are enough? Maybe. Not enough to build a permit. Actually, realistically, how expensive do you think it would be to build a permit nowadays? Would it really be so unreasonable to build one? Dude, having someone build a permit for you, that seems like such an Elon Musk thing to do. I hope he isn't watching the stream. He's gonna do it if he does. Actually, you know what, I hope he does do it. That would be kind of sick. For a mix in the shape of an X because he obsessed with the dumb fucking letter. Oh my god, true. He can build a Pura mix. That would go hard. Okay. The bend permit thing, what is that? They were just a meta slave, one trick civilization, abusing a broken mechanic, police. Honestly, I can't imagine that being true. Wait, my stream has likes? Okay. Okay. That was unlawful. Honestly, I don't even mind being sick, unless being sick stops you from getting sleep. Because with low sleep, I don't function at all. Complete this game so far, we have 15 courses done. And now we're doing the overworld, and then a couple more side levels. So I think it would be fair to say that this is like a final stretch, I guess. What if this also had a hanging rope bridge that connected here? I think that would look cool. Because surely the Yoshis don't want to walk over this all the time. Yeah, I'm deciding. The Yoshis wouldn't want to walk over that all the time. The analog 3D shipping will happen first. Even after this game is technically complete, there is still going to be more that I want to do to it. It being content complete does not mean that I will instantly release it. And even after it is complete, I will still need to... Find a good moment in time to actually release it, because I don't want Nintendo to instantly kill me. Is this a desire path moment? I don't know. Desire path is when the given path does not fit the one that you want to go down. Isn't that kind of fun though? To like not walk the obvious path. Maybe you should use that more. If a PC port happens, then it's going to be via ViceGuy's static recompilation. It would be a lot easier to port the PC port to RTYI than RTYI to the PC port. Reality isn't real. Sure. Whatever. I guess we are just saying shit now. Is that what Americans do? They're saying sorry that you're sick? Reality is real, because otherwise we'd call it falseality. That's a very good counter-argument. Well, right now I'm at zero strikes, so it wouldn't be giving me a third strike. It would just be striking me again. I don't think getting a strike would make me more famous, unfortunately. As much as I'd like that. Skazan effect. Well, at least there is an idea to port this whole game to my own IP at some point. Especially if Nintendo sends me a strike, I will have to. And I think it would be a lot less work than the rest of what we did. So that is perfectly reasonable to do. So this path here is clearly shorter. But I think it's kind of nice that there's this friendly path here to take. Yes, I am German. I don't know what happened there. I think they just stopped responding. It's kind of what Nintendo always does. First they tell you, take it down, or we will be so mad. And then they just ignore you, and you can do whatever you want. I'm a bum from New Jersey, don't you know? It's kind of an assault, that by now, I think nobody even gets that reference anymore. Well, it's been like 10 years since I last got sick too. And then now I'm suddenly super sick all the time. Because I have a baby, and the baby sneezed on her head, and then put her head in my mouth. That would get me sick. Yeah, why didn't I think of plague and sewage? Alright, the last thing missing is the cross-free entrance. Nice, I'm glad I'm feeling so drained. I've only had the power of Star Wars. I could easily smash these rocks. That kinda works. Oh, but you already need 5 stars to get here. That's silly. No, this is nonsense. This doesn't work. This needs to be different. Uhhhh. Yeah, bam. That's what I'm hoping too. And with Wiseguy's PC port, that would even run at 144 FPS easily on anyone's crappy machine. Alright. I think they should take coins, just so we can set the precedent that coins do stuff in the overworld. Something like... I don't know. I don't know. You think that works? So exhausted from hitting rocks. The boss doesn't pay us enough for this. But for 100 coins, I wouldn't mind speeding up a bit over here. Yeah, I'd probably claim it. Everyone should have 100 coins by this point, so I don't think this is an issue. The original overworld just had a cave with some crystals in front of it. I think this is a good place to put it. Okay. Okay.  Interesting.  By the way, how's the audio quality today? Since I turned off Nvidia Broadcast.  Did you get here by mucus? Alright, this looks really good to me. I like this a lot. We're gonna have some wooden beams around here. Okay. Okay. Man, if there's one thing I learned from being sick, it's that women really do have cooties. Hello, longs. Fine, I will not torture you. They got cooties. They got me sick. Okay, let's go to Jupiter to get stupider. Okay. Why was the message deleted? I don't see a message being deleted. Maybe it's because he said torture and that's a bad word or something. Oh, punishment for being late, I see. Fair enough. Well deserved. Okay. Okay. Okay. Of course it still looks kinda bad right now, but I think we're fine. Yeah, what Biobak says is a valid strategy. I just kinda started reading the Blender documentation and then tried everything it said. So I'm gonna have like a mineshaft here, and then here's gonna be a wall. And there's gonna be a mouse in front of it, and then I'll score 100 coins to keep mining. And then there's going to be a dory. Chain maybe like... Maybe to the middle pole here. That would probably be the easiest. And after freeing here, you can ride on it. Please don't tell me this is possible. Please. Please, please, please. That looks so close. Come on. Okay, I don't think it's possible. The shortcut to invert? What? How? What's the shortcut?   Ctrl-E for that edge. What? Alright, I don't think you can skip this.  Huh. That's kinda sick. Yeah, just kinda look at the platforms. I mean, there are so many factors to it, like height, call your timer. And then this is also a large edge. Hello, Skyloft. Alright, I think that's the sketch for Area 3, or Part 2, done. We have Part 3 done, so next is Part 4. Out of 50. But 4 will be a shorter part. But for today, I'm done. I need some rest. Bye bye.
