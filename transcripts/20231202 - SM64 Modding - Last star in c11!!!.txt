I gota edit this out    hello sumguy z64 says balls hello meat ark hello uwu me hello luna squid we're gonna be working on this today we're probably gonna finish this um there's one enemy we need to we can move on to the uh the 8-bit section how many stars left after this one oh my god who's calling me one second all right i just had to take that call that was zaina's dad he just needed some info about the house so what do you guys think of this area so far i want to make the fog a little bit more intense over there and then it would work out well that was not a radiation effect that was just from the transparency i guess like it that's good that's good uh it looks a bit shit in blender because of a render bug in fast 64 not much we can do about that we're just gonna have to live with it my secret drug operation now is just zaina's dad asking about some stuff nothing important how was everything you did off cam um most of what i did off cam was actually fixing up course four i finished fixing up course four so it's ready for beta testing we're gonna send it off to be tested soon uh yeah i think this is pretty good now so i do want to add some oil clouds in there and an oil drill fast 64 is open source and people are working on fixing the program up although i wish there were more people working on fast 64 no you can't break the window there's just a crack because this is a scuffed area i also noticed the floor tiles here look a bit weird not a fan of the mirroring i didn't notice that before that's much better yeah lila actually died she's not gonna show up anymore it's a pretty sad story and not white light gray is that what a crack looks like i can change the color pretty easily is that what you think it should look like again no she just never revived she's still dead i hope she's doing fine wherever she is so what even is Ellen i've never heard of Ellen before last impact and you're calling it LM that's a brain moment so this is supposed to be a drill i'm not sure how i'm gonna model in drill n64 style low poly that seems like a challenge well hopefully it's gonna be good you don't know that yet i mean of course it looks good about that but it could be that the gameplay i'm designing is just bad you know i mean of course i'm hoping it's good but you never know i save at least 10 writers we're changing a blue box to a cuboid um no hello my sunshine is this still considered a last impact sequel no it was never a last impact sequel if i called it that it was just to get clicks on a youtube video so i'm just kind of iffy if you look at now but back then shit was revolution because you were forced to go to mexico yeah i mean it's pretty crazy that it exists at all if you ask me so it's crazy to think back that i programmed that whole thing so it does not merge the ones to touch there is an option to enable that but i on purpose do not have enabled i think that works as a drill kinda we just have to merge the top and the bottom into blue slowly and then this is gonna be fine so hello biobank biobank i forgot to think about the zoo rip it was an accident so we're thinking about um a star select for the zoo i finished repairing everything in the zoo by the way all we're waiting now is for a few animations that zena's making and after that quiz 4 is once again functional somehow whenever we work we're breaking a bunch of old levels so i'm going through them all again and fixing them in general like bug fixes that i found during testing this level has a few cool new features like there's a new doll remodel um the chain chomp look the chain chomp is so much nicer looking now and the ball too the ball looked so shit before we have new eyes on the chain chomp we got get some new stuff here volley just gonna get new animations a few little fixes everywhere peter griffin fortnight dude i saw that today one of my co-workers showed me a screenshot of what peter griffin looks like at fortnight let me find that image it's so funny  that's not what peter griffin looks like bro so why is he buff exactly that's the question probably because all the animations are made for buff characters and if you put a character that's not buff in there it's just gonna look weird well peter griffin the idea with the star selects is that it shows mario traveling to the level so if we have something like that it's not gonna make much sense like it would just break the concept so i think this is generally the first bad character in fortnite yes actually i think so too so hello cocky death dude i was thinking of making a dub of the fortnight on cola kids but i'm gonna make it with hot chocolate and mario 64 hacking i feel like that would be a funny case shorts on my main channel but peter griffin the problem with that is that it's not fitting the concept it's just random things fortnite on cola yippee so i need this color here youtube is saying that i should show you guys an ad do you agree with youtube i just got a message that said please show your people an ad most of the fortnite columns are random shit that's true i don't want to show an ad you don't care and they have an ad blocker they will never add racism to fortnite so so they had mlk in fortnite they couldn't add racism that's true actually where were you when they added mlk to fortnite if you weren't playing bad news i'm canceling you on twitter well we're still sad about the fact that she died arthur foreign hmm damn this is difficult to make look right i think that kind of works for the draw do you think i'm evil what does evil even mean here that's that's the first question you need to answer me before i can give you an objective actually no i do not think you're evil let's let's see anna run against her How can you ask if anyone is evil? Have you seen the Mew2King hot take on evil people? It's the most cancerful tweet of all time. Did Lila actually die? Yeah. It's really sad. Please do not joke about Lila dying. She's a bad definition. That's a terrible definition. That doesn't mean anything. You've seen that tweet spelled Garfield with your eyes closed and someone's like, oh, that's so easy. And then the reply is, bro, you spelled Garfield so wrong. It's you. You were the one who just spelled Garfield wrong. It's 256 polygons. Okay. It's fine. No, I am joking. Super Mario Lila is not actually that at least I do not think so. We are actually joking about it. I was joking about Lila's death when I said that you can't joke about Lila's death because Lila didn't actually die. I would have kept committing, but the guy actually thought Lila died. Like, I can't keep committing at that point. That is too mean.  like he genuinely got sad on everything. I can't keep the bit going. So I'm asking if I'm bad, like the song from Michael Jackson. I do not know the song. I feel like the song might not be real. Guys, I have a weird question. Do you think of Michael Jackson as a black man or as a white man? Zayna is out with friends. I don't think of Michael Jackson them, but we just talked about them. So All right, I'll just do this. When is this room? I'm in the basement. Yes, this is just my basement. This is what it looks like. This is where I've been banished to. I am not streaming from a treehouse in the Amazon forest. Dude, that's actually so freeing that we have hashing tables now instead of normal geo layouts, because now we have so much more space for geos. We can actually have up to model ID 0x60, which is insane, dude. So No way. So Damn, KhakiDev got roasted. So 4452, okay. It needs to be more accurate with that measurement. Nope, I refuse. That was close enough. All right, let's see if that works out in game. What slur would you even call me? I'm a white German dude. There's no slur for me. I guess no, no, there's just none. Is there one? I think Germans are sometimes called potatoes, because Germany has a lot of potato farmers, but like it doesn't really hit very hard. All right, that looks pretty sweet. Yeah, Mauritz, exactly. Well, I mean, yes, they don't hurt, but I also don't know any slurs, so. Like, you would have to explain it to me. Imagine what a bizarre conversation that would be, you calling someone a slur and they're like, what does that mean? Can you like, please explain, elaborate on that? It's like explaining why a joke is funny, you know, as soon as you explain it, the jokes aren't funny anymore. Stinky potato, yeah, that's the closest one. I think I want to add a secondary drill here, but it has to be a similar distance away from the camera for the big fuck to work. Should work. Does that mean no? That's not what it means. Case versus prep time. I would beat the shit out of prep time. So the last thing missing in this area is the oil enemy. It's called Fritzlid or something, Fritzlid, but it's made out of oil instead. Oh yeah, this looks sexy. There are some polygons I can remove here, some sneaky triangles, before Biobank cusses me out. Dude, wait, if Lila comes, she's going to have a first message, right? Do we want to make a bet on what the first message is? I feel like she's going to come in and be like, Case, all of this is way too blue. Should change the colors. It looks bad when it's all blue. No, Biobank did not make any of this. I made this. What is this, dudes? It's a well-spelled message, B-Dog. Did your mom help you write it? That's what you just did to me. So this is the enemy we want. Basically, what this is going to do, this is going to slime around, and then when it sees Mario, it's going to go whoop. Whoop. And turn into a puddle like this. Then you can slide on it. Either gonna love or hate the new ship. Oh, I don't know if I like that. Is it still scary? There's a level from Lost Impact that you would like to make again, but better. The computer level, for sure. That has a very cool concept, but it just wasn't very well made. It was many people's favorite level, actually, in Lost Impact 2. Or Luna Park. Luna Park is really cool, too. But I guess we do have a theme park here. Much scarier. Oh, it's going to go whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. No, it's just going to go whoop, whoop. Nope, whoop, whoop. I never, no, I never really got into Omegle. Is it dead now? I don't think that's a big loss. Wasn't it just a website for pedophiles, anyway? Luna Park only having two stars was a shame. True. He has an end map. I should make an enemy like that. It's literally called Fizz Oil, because the original is called Fizz Lit. It's inspired by that. Or did Nintendo make one exactly like this? No, they made an electric one. Yeah, Fizz Lit. This is Fizz Oil. I think, you know, might actually be the worst website. Yeah, so he has three different eyes. Oh, I see Alpha. I see, I see. So, he also has three different eyes. They're gonna change depending on what you do. 128 divided by 3 is 42, right? So he's gonna do that with his eyes, basically. Is he just slippery? He could be fully oily when solid and turn fully orange when in a puddle and become boiling oil. Oh, that is a cool idea. Uh, combiner-wise, that's gonna be a little bit of a problem to do. Might be possible. But yes, single color oil might be a bit weird. I was just gonna make him be slippery. It would be neat if he could damage you somehow, though. Now that I think about it, but how would he damage you? Hello, clayman. I haven't even thought about how I would make him slipperier either. Assault enemy is a little bit of a... ...didn't really think it through moment. Like fire, you walk on him and start running wildly. I'm not convinced by this. Oh, we also still need to do the boiling oil environment effect at the bottom. I didn't think about that one yet. Like this here needs to be boiling oil. I think he should just make the ground slippery. That's enough, honestly. Something like if Mario's on the same surface as him, then just make the floor super slippery. He himself doesn't have any collision. And then all these staircases here would be pretty dangerous with him. I think that would be a pretty cool way of doing this. How's he dangerous? Because there's staircases everywhere. You're just gonna slide down the staircases. I mean, of course, he isn't gonna be super dangerous compared to like other enemies. Well, maybe it's gonna be more dangerous than a fucking Goomba that way. He's gonna make you slide and fall into the lava. But not every enemy has to be like a super obstacle, right? It's fine if he's more optical than or vibe-giving than dangerous. He's still gonna affect gameplay. I think he's fine. I say he is fine. Geofizz oil, nice. Wait, does that make any sense? If I set the texture shift on this... Oh, wait, on this too. Okay, that will work. As in highly attractive? Probably not better, if I had to guess. It should be insignificant by soap. Oh, that would be neat. It's not my fault, Beta. You asked for an objective assignment. It just seems unlikely. Do we have all these settings correct? No, we do not. It's a bit of both, Beta. It is flattening the ability curve and the probability curve. But I also think you're like short, like five foot seven or something. That automatically, as a male, puts you in the bottom half. I feel like I remember you being short. It is the unfortunate truth. Are there black lava bubbles in the oil? Not yet, but we still have to make the boiling oil effect. We haven't really started on it yet. His mouth will be animated. See, Asha, so I was right. Let's go. GeoFizz, all eyes, does not exist. Well, obviously. Ah yes, what a beautiful day it is today to have angry arguments in Twitch chat. Where is the GBI definition for this, huh? You're like 173, not especially tall, but how much is that in feet and centimeters? Inches and feet. That is 5'7". Wait, you're so short? That's crazy. But yeah, I agree, it doesn't matter too much. Right for males, I think physical attractiveness doesn't matter too much. It's more like height matters because physical dominance kind of matters, I think. I think that's how it works. But it also matters a lot more if you as a male care about it, because now you're gonna come off insecure because you care about it, or you think it matters. The more you think it matters, the more it matters. I think that's the way to put it. Where are my definitions? Oh, I guess here's fine. Who cares? Rogan's one wife and thinks he's an expert. No, I'm not an expert. I never claimed to be an expert. Okay, so we should use O&M state here, I think. Okay, so the first selection, this is the offset. What's a good shift? 42? That's not an upset, I'm gonna guess my goal. Oh, okay. Certified woman now. Okay, well, I guess that's what I am now. My certification is by marriage certificate, maybe? Although, I don't know. I will just stop talking about this, because we all know that none of us have any idea what we're talking about. There was this one streamer I was recommended to look at, because apparently he had pretty into politics, the streamer, and I watched the streamer, and five minutes into the video that had nothing to do with dating, he just started talking about dating advice for about 30 minutes. I think that's very funny. It's like, that tells you so much about the people that watch this guy, that that's like what he's just talking about. Yo, hello Leela, can't believe you're alive. Yeah, the music is really nice. When I was watching this guy, look, I was watching him because I was recommended this person, and I wanted to see it, okay? I wanted to see what it was about, I didn't know it was gonna be that. We were not discussing Leela's absence, we were discussing Leela's death from two weeks ago. Can you believe she died? Crazy. Are we talking about... Oh, you probably haven't heard of her. She was here, like, I think up until three weeks ago, and then she died, so you wouldn't have heard of her before. Her name is Leela. She used to be a mod in this chat. It's really sad when we lost her. Okay, I do not see the eye animation, although I like his size and stuff. Why was his eye not animated? Oh, I know why, because I didn't delete the thing. Wait, I did delete the thing. Huh. Let's just make sure this actually affects it before we move on. Hello, Chris Doyle. Shit, that reminds me, I'm supposed to be on a podcast at some point. I'm supposed to talk about programming on a podcast. I'm becoming a political podcast YouTuber. You think I'd be good at it? Honestly, I would be pretty good at stirring up controversy. If I didn't have a life, where I would actually have to be a respectable person. Dude, I could talk so much shit on podcasts. Pfft. Why is this not affecting the tile size? This used to work. Opinions on this compression method. Let's see this. That's interesting, actually. That's crazy, but... No, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. That sounds like bullshit. No, no, no, no, my bullshit detector is going off. I think that tweet's a lie. I think... What they're meaning to say is... They're storing... The soundtracks... At half the frequency. And they're just playing it back... In the higher frequency that the total engine output is. Yeah. Okay, I'll put it at the same thought. Yeah, exactly.   Okay. Bing-up. The bing-ups are chasing me. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I think I see the issue. Oh, nevermind. It's right here. What the hell? What's going on? Wait. Is this not affecting it? Because... It's not running? Could this be not running? I have no idea. If we do that, we kind of need it everywhere, though. In all 50 levels, I feel like. It's gonna be difficult to do. It's also hard to play them at different speeds and all that, because of how it's programmed. Because it's like an actual stream zone. We're kind of limited in what we can do. Let's see a video with a 10-second preview of each level running on console. Hmm. Maybe that would be interesting, yeah. The flizzler is not taking its texture argument for some reason. What happens if I do this? The instruments slash speed. See, that's the thing. We can't change the instruments. That's already where we're losing here. Yeah, I think this function is just not running. Let me try something like this. I know this looks absolutely brain-damaged, but I have an idea. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Goddammit. That did something. Alright, alright, we're in there. We're in there. We're winning. Well, that happened. Alright. I think it's going to be... How much is a full texture? 64x64. It's 4096, right? So should this be 4096 divided by 3? 1365? That doesn't make any sense. There's no way it's 1365. What if we just try 0x40? Oh. Do you only ever listen to video game music? On stream, yes. When I'm not streaming, I don't listen to video game music at all. Okay, that's good already. Okay. Okay, that's just a little bit too much. I feel like there's a way to compute this instead of guessing it, but I don't know how. Okay, a little bit more. What is 0xA0 multiplied by 3 similar to? The hell?  Is it 0x20 divided by 3? So 170, is that what I'm multiplying with? Is a full texture 0x200? I've heard it's 12. Hey, let's not use a texture unless we need two function calls. Hey! It was 512. So this expression is gonna change slowly while he's doing his animation here. Before he goes boop and then shboop. And then after that, we can program the bottom here. Don't worry about it, baby boy. Girl. No, I can't say baby girl. It's so funny to call people asking you questions baby boy, but it doesn't work when it's a girl. And you can't just call someone in Shen baby girl. It doesn't work. It's too cringe. Baby person? Yeah, let's go. I'll do that. Baby person. Look, it's better than calling you baby girl, I'll be honest. And rather that fuck up than calling you the other thing. Okay, let's program the actions. Case is so canceled. Wait, why? What did I do this time? I'm dead? Oh my god. That is honestly, yeah, that's the twitter worthy interpretation. Dude, I watched the Skillenio callout video again today because I got a comment on it and it is so funny. Dude, during the whole Skillenio calling me out video, he's like, Case is claiming I stole levels. I apologized for this already. And at the end of the video, I click on his channel and his most recent video was why Super Mario 65 levels are not stolen. Dude, he actually talks like Yandere Dev in this video. That is very comedy to me. I think we're going to give these a very simple behavior pattern. We're going to have them crawl forward for some amount that we specify. Then we're going to have them do a swoop attack. So this is going to be swoop swoop. And then. And then we just crawl backwards again. Yeah, we don't even need an action free. He does kind of sound like him and he has the same intonation. They are. I wonder if there's if there's just like an archetype, just something wrong in your brain that makes you like Yandere Dev. There's also Skellogs. Skellogs is a pedophile. There are people that are not they don't prefer minors. They just need someone to take advantage of. And I think he is in that camp. Yeah. No, I don't think he got that far. You know the funniest thing about YandereDev? He got outed as a pedophile, but he's still a virgin. Like, you just lost so hard on that one. I think it's like, you know, that arc-type of loser. In that time, I uploaded one of my unused scanshop levels to the scanshop warehouse with please do not steal to see if he would steal it. Yeah, that's Skelaneo, not Skellex. Skellex doesn't steal levels. Skellex is actually pretty good at making games. I gotta shoot that boop, so that's gonna be like 65 frames, maybe? I did see YandereDev self-scouted a little bit there. Good Leela, good. Okay. Interesting. When you called him Scalos and the Last Impact was on Vermus? No, actually. That's the craziest part. The thing is, the font I used to Last Impact didn't have an X. Because I replaced the Mario 64 font. So I was like, okay, it's fine. There's also the fact that his name, he told me once, comes from the Latin word Scalos. So I thought it doesn't really matter. The Latin word for evil or something. And it refers to criminals, some of them as crimes, some of them as criminals, yeah. Wicked Highness. Let's see what Arthur says, because you should look at what Comet posted in RomShack. Oh no. Oh no. You know what? I don't have 250k yet, though. How many do I have? I don't think I have 250k. Main channel has 239.000, second one has 11.000. Okay, I have a combined 250k, so guys, it's Jove. Yeah, I made it work on N64. What is this image, Leela? Are you just framing that now? Oh, they were asking, that's why I posted it, oh, okay. I used to like the songs by Apache a lot, but the last album he released was kinda lame. But everything before that's pretty good. Okay, I need to place this guy on the floor. The gay sex song from Rammstein. That one's kind of a banger, not gonna lie. It is metal as fuck. I'm Steph from Vanilla64, I suppose what this means is that Homebrew is exiting this month. A Homebrew is exiting this month? That's different from like a patch from R64. I mean, okay, when you release a patch for this game, you're basically like just pretending you make a patch, because everything's changed. Like, no byte is the same unless it's by sheer coincidence, which is gonna happen sometimes. Doesn't Lip Dragon perform like shit right now? Is that how you run around CND? I get around legal stuff by just releasing a patch, yeah. Did you guys know that there's a ROM hacker posted today? He actually hired an IP lawyer to get his ROM hack back up online. He released the update today that the IP lawyer successfully submitted a claim and YouTube's looking at it. So maybe soon we'll have news. Okay, this is the same code, but I wanna just put this in brackets just to make sure. I don't know what's going on here. It's very weird. So he didn't get his video back, but he did hire an IP lawyer and they got it now to be sent back to the claimant. It's very likely that the video will come back online. Yes, it's done. I do wanna post that screenshot on Twitter, because it's gonna be insane clout. Okay, why doesn't this guy ever turn around? What the fuck? Did I export his new beeper? I think I did. Huh? I'm just gonna print. If you're bangers, we're bangers. I called IP lawyers because they piss a lot during trials. What? What?  What? Is this what we want? Is this how it goes? I think yes. 600 second timeout again. Wait, what? Did he deserve that? I should just copy this from the Belzer cards. He was saying a variety of bad words. Oh, did he just start writing slurs or something? That doesn't seem very Arthur-like. Alright, my man is moving smoothly. I do want him to move a bit further. The Romshack discussion incident. I don't understand. I'll just trust my moderators, surely they will make sensible decisions. He broke the rules. Oh, right, there's the one rule, don't get banned. He got banned, he broke that rule. Are you acting like a madman or is it a chair? What do you think? This area is below the oil rig, it's underground. Did you know that there's a really cool skip you can do here? Isn't that fucking sick movement? Okay, this is looking good. Now we just need the animation. The Moonswim is pretty OP, I'm thinking of nerfing it a little bit. I think all the hydraulics here are so cool. But yeah, you can tell this is underwater from the fact that when you look outside, there's underwater out there. Oh, the one edge there is pretty bad. Fix that. That should be fine now. No fish down the variator drill. Well, this is supposed to be all oiled up, so I'm thinking there should be dead fish here. I think Romhacks creates more loyalty and fandom around Nintendo. I cannot think of any reason to ban Romhack in 2013 games. Yes. It is likely not a very smart marketing move to ban Romhacking. The idea, though, on Nintendo's side probably is that you ban Romhacking. Not because of the profit that you lose, but because you are worried about your IP loss. Because companies have an obligation to protect their IP if they want to keep their IP. If you establish a history of not protecting your IP, you're going to end up losing it. They're lying to me? What are they lying to me about? You are an innocent man. All you did was make a great joke. I actually want him to be at the bottom of the stairs. That was a perfectly Chromulent word. I feel like Chromulent is a real word, though. Those words, like the combination of the letters you use there, they have just individual parts of words that are real enough for it to probably make sense to at least one person in the world. That's so funny. I think I'm going to add more substrates here just for the Shwoopboop to be easier to program. That's the scientific term, the Shwoopboop. So this is going to be the Shwoopboop. And then another Shwoopboop again. Restorate. Okay, not reading, whatever the fuck that is. Okay, I ended up trying to act like someone got a digital blueprint. True, can't believe I got a digital blueprint. Mine's already screwed up anyway, I have nothing more to lose. I was doing a full-time job, pretty well. Now, calling people dumb and this shit is perfectly allowed honestly. I have to do this differently. Okay, the short boob has to look natural. I have the perfect thing. No, that's a bad idea actually. We don't want it to look the same as the disappear animation. Actually we kinda do. I think I do want it to look the same. I don't need this function then. Doesn't work this way, this sucks. Why is the error like this dude? That's fucked up. Wait, that's actually fucked up. Why is my error like this? It really shouldn't be. Okay, I'm making a note for this. This is actually a performance tweak. Invert, no, transpose the scale table matrix. What it is right now is terrible for cache cleaning, see? So, what do you type the first time? Me? How long will that take to change? It will take a bit. I'm not doing that right now. So, it should look a little bit wrong now when the animation starts. We're gonna have to give it a bit of an offset. Okay, interesting start here. Did I not touch the X on Z scale? What the hell? I want my equate volume function back please. This is weird. It is very squashed and stretchy. But it's not good. There are a few bugs to work out. Honestly, I don't think TikTok is that big of an issue. Because you can just opt to ignore it. And then it doesn't matter at all. It's not even difficult to just ignore. Let me just add a few prints. Just so we have an easier time here. What the fuck? He got the wings. Okay, I need to mark this guy specifically. That many prints are just crashing the game. You blocked him? Isn't that the same thing as cancelling him? Yeah. Yeah. You got blocked by the blue red girl. You're cancelled. It's over for you. This looks fine. And then the beginning of action 3 looks weird. Can I have blue hair? Damn.  They learned from the first mistake, Arthur. This is actually not at all what we want. This is the opposite of what we want. This is the opposite of what we want. How does this look? Okay, that's something. Interesting. There are some mistakes. Right, this shouldn't be this. For the last swoop. Wait, we don't even need this. Right. And the maximum size we want is 5. So we need to make sure that 1 divided by this to the power of 2 is 5. Right, so 5 is equal to the square root of... No, that doesn't make any sense. It needs to be a 25th then. So 0.04. Square root of T, 0.04. 0.2. Let's try this. See how it works out. Yeah, my chat has become a little bit unreadable for a bit. I've just kind of been programming and ignoring it. Okay, so this is fine. This is fine. This is not fine. The problem is action 4 went to action 0 instead of action 5 this whole time. Well, that explains everything. I will make a video soon about the worst code that actually ends up making your game better that you can possibly make. I think that'd be a very funny video. Okay, okay. This is getting there. This should probably also be scaled by B prime. Yeah, I have some truly terrible codes. This is my favorite one to show. The A10 to S code. Look at this. How is this even C code? What the fuck is going on here? This is what the code looks like. It's truly terrible. Is there a way of writing that in C and making the compiler less terrible? That is written in C. But no, there's no way that I found to make that better. I mean real C. Are you saying I'm writing in fake C? Unbelievable. That's so rude. Let me show you a funny message I got. Let me see if I can screenshot this. This is the funniest one ever. Where is it? Shit, I can't find it. That's so sad. That was so funny. It's gone. Yeah, it's gone. Someone was like, Case, you should put all the animations into one C file. Hopefully, it will make the game faster or slower. It just made no sense at all. Someone from hating you to loving you? Yeah, I don't know why either. I don't know what happened the last 10 minutes. I wasn't reading chat. The whole thing was a shit show. I want them to be a lot smaller here. I actually think maybe more than five times scale is fine here. It's because of how wide this is. Wait, what? Why is it doing this again? Yeah, judging by that, maybe 50 times scale is fine. So, SQRT 0.02 should be the max. Oh, so 0.15. It's investing time in making it much more optimized and pretty much as good as it can be. Now, we're still finding optimizations for that. It can be even bigger. Okay. Interesting. Yeah, I kinda like it now. What kind of interaction should they have with Mario when you just walk into them? Maybe just like pushing him out? Like no damage? I feel like that would be appropriate. Oh no! You can clip into this? No way! Oh that sucks. Do you have a plan for when they transition between the angles and clip into the ground? What do you mean? I mean they do kinda look like they clip into the staircase there. I think that's just an inaccuracy that we can't really do much for. It does suck. I don't like it. When they go over a corner? Oh I don't think that's too bad. Alright it looks completely fine here. Oh but those are convex so they don't count. Maybe this one's better? I think it looks fine. It's good enough. It's more noticeable when it was flat? And clipping into the ground? I don't see him clipping here. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean. Oh they're not supposed to move while they're squished. And now they should have a pretty cute walk animation. Let's see him bounce. Oh that looks so good. I like it a lot. That's a rink man? Who's that? How many graphics in an adventure have I done? I don't know. I don't remember any graphics in that game. You get two views on your short? Let's fucking go. Dude, unironically I thought I had your Mario Maker short recommended to me. It was on my start page. Just yesterday I think or two days ago. Okay so we have this working as intended. Next we need an interaction. And some other stuff. What kind of hitbox fits to him? That's the one thing I'm wondering about. Probably just igloo barrier. 75 radius. And 160 ground. One of them is city views and even city revenue. I think they do have a very low floor but they also have a much higher ceiling maybe. They can also bring in a new audience hopefully. Like you're targeting a slightly different market. Yeah this interaction looks good to me. And then this will be super slippery. Does it push me? It does. It's a point of tapping in a new market. Some people are gonna watch your regular stuff. I guess short content is also often more shareable than a whole YouTube video. I don't know. Didn't push me out once. Now how do we best make this slippery? We should have... Since we don't want to touch engine code, we need to somehow externally do this. What we could do is... If Mario is overlapping this, we store the triangle that Mario is standing on and we just dynamically edit the triangle. Oh you mean the code that I'm literally looking at right now. Yeah I've heard of this before. But editing this here is a terrible idea. Because you're editing in engine code. No what I will do is... When Mario is in the radius. Mario is in the radius. And Mario is on a surface. We edit the surface. Once Mario leaves the surface we reset it. Or once... The thing is done.  Alright. Let's try this. Let's make surf slippery. So find surface below Mario. Make it slippery. Back it up. Let's see. Floor pointer. We're gonna add a 0x1B. More backup. Oh and we also need to backup the surface type. Let's do 0x1C for this. Let's do 0x1B for this. Hello, sorry. Are you gonna guarantee you change the surface back reliably though? Don't worry about it. It's easy. It's kind of entertaining to you but it's not as hardcoded. I'd make like a variable for Mario that tells him to treat all bosses severely if the enemies have that. That's possible too but it's still an engine change. We can do this without an engine change like this and I prefer that. Just because it means 1D cache access per frame less. You're gonna waste 0.1 microseconds here. First 0.1 microseconds not much. But you do this 20 times and now you're down 2 microseconds. Also doesn't sound like much. But you're also having the code there. Honestly on average it's more like 4 microseconds at that point. It's just bad practice. Yes, 4 microseconds is a lot in my world. That's better. Cache noises. Did someone subscribe or something? Did I miss something? 150. 127 actually. Oh but that's the Y axis. Wait. How much is on the others? 74. Is this object only 70 coordinates? I thought it was 100 coordinates. No wonder my math didn't work. 75. Okay. Okay. That's 8, right? Yeah. Alright. I should now make everything slippery. You want to know why I always say good morning? Because it's always morning somewhere in the world. Actually the real reason is because I love a struggle. It should actually unslippery the surface every frame instead of only sometimes. It's fine to do this every frame instead of when the surface changes. It doesn't really make a difference. I think they move fast enough. Because they never give you the time of day. Oh. Okay, it works. That's kind of cool. Look, as soon as he comes, it gets slippery. They're not very dangerous enemies, but they're very cool. Now we got to make it so that hitting them with soap just kills them. Oh, and the soap's working. I feel like that mechanic could be used so well in Extreme Hacks. Does that mean it has a name? Fizz Oil. I think it's fine the way they are. They don't need to be faster. They're here for the vibes, you know? Oh, that's one issue actually with making it so that you can kill them. If we make it so that you can kill them, then you would think you get a star for doing it. Okay. I kind of don't want that, but making it so you can kill them is kind of like a really good hint for the boss. Yeah, just make him drop two coins. Okay, we need to fix the soap first, though. And I didn't think we would get them done so fast. Here we are. Now they should be killable with soap. Hello, Missy. Okay. Can you see the mouse? Mouse steps down the stairs and that's it. Yeah, but you will fall into the boiling oil right here, which will damage you. But yes, they are not super harmful enemies. I don't think they need to be super dangerous for them to be a valuable inclusion.  Everything good has to end? What has to end? This game has to end? I mean, I guess it does, yeah. Unless we put procedural infinite content at the end. You guys think that would be a fun inclusion? Just a procedurally generated infinite world you can explore at the end of the game? Procedural generation sucks. What? No, what about just like a giant empty field for Mario to run in? And it's just like a height map that's randomly generated and you can just go. And then we add realistic deer that run next to Mario. How long would it be to implement? Not too hard. It would probably be done in a day or so. Nintendo hired this man. Nintendo hired this man. He's you. Using Unreal Engine, anyway he can. Okay, what if we just, or the flags focus a bit here, because they seem to be unset somewhere. How does it not have a field flags? Let's see if this is better. At least some flags seem to be adjusting that. Eh? What the hell? Oh Wait a second This is why Dude how did I remember that I'm fucking insane 14 actually Oh Hey Oh What a summer forest And then just for me tourism and just move different areas with no patient and setting or tone whatsoever We've already tried that in Mario 64 madness Didn't go so well Mario 64 madness is an absurdist masterpiece. I'll say it for everyone I Think it's the most original theming for level that you came up with Hmm My level still real dream is pretty creative, but I think it's been done before it's a computer level kinda But it's also been done before All Alone bubble dome is very creative. I find I don't think that's really been done before Same with the zoo level. I can't remember a 3d platformer as a zoo level I Don't want this to look exactly like this Oh How long has it been since I last ran the spawn coin functions, holy shit It's been forever And my objects don't spawn enough coins I Something has been missing in a lesson. I'm assuming true. There was no swimming in them. I Do actually want to upload a new preview for all alone bubble dome a little bit this Sunday was the plan I kind of want to upload some rty content just so people know that the game is not bad You Okay, so the scale was not good Why was the scale not good On streams minus our timer divided by bounce frames because this is all done Catch Mario 64 the hell is that Oh What went wrong Would you make a brand new game for the n64 what What is the weird question I Mean, I'm not doing it. So unless something changes, I wouldn't do it because I'm not doing it right now That is proof that I wouldn't What changes before I won't do it And Then right now no It's like if you ask me are you dying right now and I'm not dying right now you see me not dying right now That is proof. I'm not dying right now Don't have to be more specific about the wording before I can understand your question because I'm actually generally just confused right now I Think this would look better without the monster and stuff Let's try 15 I Interested in making a new game for the n64 I Wish I could But it's not financially viable decision for me to make And I do have a family now that I need to provide for So I can't just fuck around with my time and do that. I have to make sensible decisions I Want my equals was the best I That's the name for this You Wait, that's not what I meant to do There we go Error Talk to me Yoshi of the week RT by idea All from your sister's win concern they have a visit someday Their terms are liability That's funny how do they act I Am not a daddy Okay, I think that looks good I want to add a proof to it Yeah We don't have a kid yet when we're gonna Are these mist particles going I don't see the mist particles. Oh, they're really small See Particle Mental die particles Okay, we're just gonna make our own particle here Making a new particle wouldn't be so bad One in circle, okay, we don't want it to spawn in circle generate when the magnet seems good Count two and decreasing capacity like it Then someone says that's done no, no, no, I will definitely open sources like no worry This is guaranteed open source I want people to be able to maintain this code base after I leave the scene And I want other people to be able to make hex off of my engine I feel like this would look better if it was like dark particles This looks like a very cool burning out effect honestly, but it needs to be darker particles I Can't use it materiality one I Then also looks like he's getting angry I want the dark smoke here Let's see what else we have Oh Or in smoke 45 I think that's gonna look a bit better I think a little more random size maybe a few less particles although honestly the particle count seems fine to me if the size range be a lot bigger what about the speed here I think the speed is fine the speed it gives me really like dying vibes I don't know if that makes sense like really like oh his soul is leaving his body definitely looks like you're cleaning it up now yeah I like this the particle engine is so useful for this it's almost like Niagara engine the non-real engine but like the absolute poverty version of it but we're cleaning up oil the bubbles are not gonna be clean I like this either way I think we have finished this area I do want to have some dead fish in here and that's about it let me just see my notes here oil clouds right I still want to add oil clouds here all right I will do that off stream I'm getting a little tired of stream I'll add a few oil clouds to the drills why is he dusty yeah oil bubbles that split up like stars from the ground we can't use the soul particles too we'll look into this I'm getting tired of streaming I'll see you guys in the next stream which is next week I'll have a two weeks so maybe I can stream a little bit more I'm not sure I'll see ya bye bye
