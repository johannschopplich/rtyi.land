Hello. Hello. Anybody here. Just put the camera on me. It's been a while since I wore a tank top on stream and get to see my muscles today for the first time in like half a year. Oh my god, they've grown since I last streamed. Hello, Zaina. Bob guy. I can't believe Lilaa would call me Bob. She is bullying me. Did you see they started allowing emulators on the app store? I heard that, but I don't know if that's true. Delta rune OST. Hello, bro. Have you been working out? You look bigger. I am always working out. I work out like almost every day. But this is the first stream in a long time that I've been wearing a tank top again. You see six months of progress at once, so it looks a little insane. Hello, Sully. Hello, Obra Zep. Is that a fucking chow? Offstream, I've been working on this area here. It sometimes randomly crashes when entering, but I'm sure we can figure that out. What do you think of my new area? I really like the way the lighting fits in here when you go near the flames. Hello. God damn it. Really? It still crashes when you hit the wall. I thought I fixed this before stream started. God damn it. Okay, this is legitimately the nastiest crash of all time. Break texture, make it a lock. That's worth considering, but I want it to be a break honestly. Looking like a physical beast today. It's just the first time in a long time I'm streaming in a tank top. Breaks don't shape like that. It's weird. Yeah, but it's fun. You know? Do you like to have fun, Lila? Hello, Obra Zap. Hello, Midwest Mystic. Yep, I live stream here once a week, if you didn't know. Okay, so basically the bug here, the crash that we just ran into, is that it's using the S8 register. Doesn't sound like an issue, but it is. When did you say it, like what? My mother is fun? You think so? Level DDD has a smaller wall barriers. What is level DDD? I don't think there's wall bolts here. I think we can remove this. Okay, so what we're doing right now, just a quick detour. There's a weird issue here. Let me explain. I'm using a fucked up optimization that stores the current object pointer. In the FP register, which is the same as the S8 register in GCC. And... This function here decides to overwrite the S8 register with some random local variable. So my current object pointer gets overwritten by some random local object variable if you're swimming. We need this voice in the ice castle. Why the military cut? Because my wife fucked up my haircut. You see this shit here? She was using the clippers to cut it short. And then the front thing of the clippers came off and she just kept going. And now there was a whole bald line here. So we had to cut it short, so it doesn't look too weird.  So we had to cut it short, so it doesn't look too weird. So we had to cut it short, so it doesn't look too weird. Why don't you upload since months in CaseVods? Because I'm streaming here. On CaseClips. That's where the vods are now. It's been a last week, true. And it will be even better next week. Oh yeah, have I told you guys the concept for the quest 13 that we want to do next? After the side area here is done? You guys want to hear it? Yeah, I don't like the beanie. It's very annoying. Hello Raydee. Raydee, I saw your comics today, but I did not have time to read it. So I just ended up not engaging with it for now. So I just ended up not engaging with it for now. Was that the music themed one? Nope. We're not doing a music themed one. Quest 13 is going to be an ice castle. On top of a mountain. And it's going to be very gloomy and scary and dark. Or maybe more suspenseful than gloomy and scary and dark. Dude, I made a video about invisible walls today. This shit's doing so well. But I'm getting so many comments that are like, Case, why not just put a death floor below that? Have you guys played Mario 64 crossed with Banjo-Tooie? You would know why we don't just put a death floor below the level. Another darker level, in case you need more daytime. That's a fair point, honestly. Well, it doesn't need to be nighttime, you know. Something like Snobby Grunts from Zelda Truncheon? Exactly. I was thinking like Hollow Root Keep in The Missing Link. Exactly. I was thinking like Hollow Root Keep in The Missing Link. Yes, I'm going to be using my own game as inspiration. Yes, I'm going to be using my own game as inspiration. What you gonna do about it? The question is, why does this thing here The question is, why does this thing here even use so many registers? Can we reduce this somehow? Can we reduce this somehow? No, we still don't know what the boss would be. Why didn't you sleep enough? What the fuck is this? Shake my hand in disapproval. Shake my hand in disapproval. I'm up for making that level I'm up for making that level daytime Lilaa. We weren't thinking about dark. That's the wrong idea. It was gonna be white and desaturated blues. That was gonna be the color theme. So it would be pretty bright, but it would be scary and gloomy.  Anything new on F3DX3 and RQIA? Nope, I'm still waiting for Sauron to make the final decisions on that. Nope, I'm still waiting for Sauron to make the final decisions on that. Does this change anything compilation-wise? Nope, it does not. I guess it's a good change anyway. I guess it's a good change anyway. And my VSC is bugged out again. Hello, Velzer. What if we just only do one run here?  Does it change anything? Does this change anything? That does change something. Oh, looks like that got rid of S8 here. Very, very nice. By my calculations, we should now be rid of the crash. Hey, streamer Lilaa is here. I like how Lilaa being here just makes the stream 20% better for you. I like how Lilaa being here just makes the stream 20% better for you. I've been learning Unreal Engine recently. Get hyped now, AngelScript is very cool. I've been working in Unreal Engine for almost 2 years now and I have no idea what AngelScript is. Hello, KazeniLuigi. Hello, KazeniLuigi. Yeah, maybe Kazeni. Alright, that is one bug gone.  Because I don't know it. Lightning looks for courses are as follows. Light, light, dark, sunset, dark, sunset, light, dark, sunset, sunset, sunset, dark. Light, light, dark, dark, sunset, dark, sunset, light, dark, sunset, sunset, sunset, dark. How do you see so many sunsets? Which levels do you think have sunsets?  No, but I don't think you would be. Because people with a conjoined brain are not quite so smart. Why would you be? Oh, I see. That just sounds awful. Okay, I wanted to actually look at the current level some more. Zoo? Okay, Zoo is sunset. Oily Bonny Bay is not sunset. Wild West is absolutely not sunset. Wild West is literally high noon with the sun at the top. Dino Dino Land, also not sunset. Where do you get that from? Koopa Wave Cove is a sunset, maybe. Like with the weird funky sun. Wild West has sunset lightning. It absolutely does not. It has the lightning coming from above. Wait, you're just making that up. Hey, it doesn't crash. Right, and then this is the area we want to do today. This has some gameplay, but obviously the visuals are not here at all. So the plan here would be to go over here and then jump up there, which doesn't work because of the collision. And then this one might be a little bit difficult because you'd have to land on here and slide into the coin. I think that's too much for Kristo. Okay, look at Wild West and tell me. Okay, Lila, let's look at the Wild West and see if that's a fucking sunset lightning. I'm 100% sure I'm right. I'm just going to look at this to embarrass you. No, no in-game. Show object lightning. Okay. Hello, Skyloft. Embarrass her, Kaze. We will embarrass her harshly. Wrong level. I don't know if RTYL will be beatable.    I'm not really considering that. Where's the sunset? Sun is literally coming from above. Look at the colors. He's slightly orange. Because the entire environment is orange. It's going to reflect orange on him. The oranges in my kitchen have sunset lighting.  You're getting roasted by Biobak, Lila. It looks like Dawn to you. Is there anything you're missing from the Wild West? We got the milk bar. We got the big iron. We got the bank and the tumbleweed store. I need help. I want to replace this but I'm at a loss for ideas. You are right. Changing this to something structure related would be a good idea. Lilaa is going to go cry. I'm sorry, Lila. Nice haircut. You really think this is a nice haircut, Seth? Hello, Nicholas. Welcome back to the stream. How do you turn this into something structure related? Crane with a little operation room. The problem is there are already so many cranes here. This is kind of like a pipe that goes inside. You put signs. Is there a construction elevator? Is this inspiration? We have tons of pipes. That sounds cool. I'm going to cut your hair next time. Maybe. Bye, Nicholas. Hello, Mr. Cat. This is going to be a dark level.   The new level will not be a dark level. It will be extremely bright. It's going to be scary. I want this coin to be easier. I don't like how difficult it is to slide on here. I have not been sick now, who are you asking that? In one word or less, can you explain string theory to me? Yes. In one word, I've answered your question. I want a nighttime area outside with Aurora Borealis. I'm up for that. You're the only person to give a smart answer like that. I know it's what you want to do here. I know it's exactly what you want to do here. You are into that shit. I am good. Did you watch the full pattern video? No, I can't. It's four hours of information that I mostly already have. . It is a great video but. It's not something for me. It's not going to work. It's going to be an outside that's snowy foggy snow. Some of the insertion has got more like spooky Mario ghost house. No, it has very, very cold colors. And it's not going to be the idea is not spooky. The idea is more like so real. If that makes sense. And that's a cheese on that string. Someone said come together something like that. But they didn't answer your question. Case when you say no, like a cat. Wait, what? You should make a gaming UI five hours stream after this. Oh god, no. Said no. Case you agree that kissing women is gay. If you are a f... Actually, even if you are a female, kissing women isn't necessarily gay. Some women do it just for fun. Maybe that is a little bit gay. This is just a remake of an old level, or well, this is just, we're just remaking one area of an old level because I have watched playtesters play it and I realized this area fucking sucks. It's in gay for men to kiss women, no. What was this area before? Let me show you. I have a clip of this on my case clips channel that I'm gonna be releasing tomorrow, but you guys get an exclusive preview. It's called Boring Red Coin Mission that will be removed from the game. This is what it was. It was cute, yeah, but it wasn't very fun. Watch how I'm avoiding the water because of the water crash just built that. When you remove it, you love it. It's boring. It's still gonna be 8 reds. This is also just not nice to control. The fling vines, eh? Waiting on these things, eh? The fling was cool, yeah, but the camera is so shit. You guys don't notice the problems in this because I'm playing Mario 64 so well. I think if someone who sucked Mario 64 would play this, they would notice that there's Can you make it so that when you fling you can actually see yeah that's one of the problems but the mission is removed anyway so I don't even need to look into that so that I'm fungi mines for the music fungi mines let me check out fungi mines fungi mines OST yeah yeah you get my vibe I like this it's a more difficult question you know I don't think I'm qualified to answer this I don't have a degree in that maybe then but the whole thing's gone anyway so it is what it is why is my health meter showing up like that yeah okay let's do some texturing on here then those blocks look so random these here I am planning on making entrances for each one as in something that they come out of oh my god this is so loud I have jungle level do you have none yeah this game don't know when to do when you fall into the water no the game perfectly knows what to do when you fall in the water what do you mean dude I never noticed that look how nice the speed transitions it's actually like jumping off a thing oh that's so cool but so much better here than vanilla Mario 64 actually just keep your velocity look at that it's beautiful I recommend glide on 64 sky or javo it's not terrible beat art but I don't think I should make the change especially not so late into the games development we're gonna counter quick to splash yes per area splash colors are planned it's amazing case we what you don't go for logic for when the skybox falling to the water this is true sure truly acted in this woman I think I'm gonna split this area up here and now we have two separate areas and I want to make sure it renders correctly just so I didn't fuck anything up are you a wow beast beast beast beast girly or real girly or true girly I don't think I'm a girly at all I'm planning to add a QTE for dragging a bomb bomb into the water and drowning it or is that out of scope yeah I am more confused by that message than from whatever the fuck Lilaa is going on about right now oh yeah that is good that's some good shit let's go that looks nice this is what this area has been missing you say girly or girly and the first one I'll is that what you've been doing with the quaternions Lilaa you've been gas lighting us and quick warning this area might randomly crash it is what it is though all right let's add some decorations here I think we really just need to you at this area here and then we're almost done it's at the same geometry here so why the ruins is green that's it's reflecting the water color  this is how light to be doing things yeah that fits pretty well reflecting what light the light that comes from in here then will the engine be open source yes it will be I don't know if it's because I haven't played Deltarune but so far I prefer the Undertale OST this is my first time listening to the Deltarune OST by the way fun facts do you make your own textures for your games or does someone else make them for you? I have them all from random games. I rarely make textures. I start with Red Deltarune music but I have not played either game. Interesting. Oh yeah, Zeina also makes textures. I think Biobak also sometimes makes textures for the levels the team works on. So a bunch of indie- yeah, that's funny actually. All the indie games are like, yes, this is my low poly indie game and then it's like 10,000 polygons with no texture and flat shading. Yeah, very, very low poly, bro. You got the spirit. That's also a thing. Pixel art games that are actually like working based on pixels. Ha ha ha Longwindow I eat meat like true humans Do true humans eat meat? Can I get the opinion of the Vogue Left on this one? I wish I could skip out on meat personally, fair Personally, I think that the people that eat meat nowadays in a few years, they will be looked at as like the worst people ever. The same way we look at Nazis or something nowadays. I still eat meat though, but I think people in the future will fucking hate me. If I ever become immortal, I will stop eating meat just because I don't want people in the future to be mad at me. Did you not model this in red? Not quite. I know, it was a mistake. What game are you working on right now? Return to Yoshi's Island. Do you miss anything that's normalized nowadays? No one would ever see you as a bad person for it. I think in a few hundred years, like if I was immortal and I still lived, then people would be upset at me. I know it's normal nowadays, so no one cares. I'm perfectly understanding this. But not from your past? Not even from your past. It wouldn't make sense. You know people get upset over things. I'm sorry, just one of the instruments though, so I mean it's of all of them. Wait, really? I don't know. I thought eating plant based was like really difficult still. If you don't want to be unhealthy, that is good to know. 2045, so that should be 4 full apartments I think. Hey! B12, true. You've been eating meat since I last saw you, I doubt it's ever going to change. I don't know. I am not that confident. There might just be like a few hundred years of time where that is changed. The world keeps changing. Do you think that if everyone started thinking as if they would live eternally, the world would be a better place? What disadvantages would that have on the state of the world? I don't think there would be any. 1750, so that's 7, so 3.5. My Mario 64 VR won't run smooth unless betterment and radiation. I have no idea why. Yeah, you did, horsey. Conservative debate is butchered by interest groups? Well, that's always the case about any issue ever. Shouldn't ever listen to like any public politics debates. Unless it's on case clips on youtube.com of course. You're only one reliable source of information. If you had 24 hours to live how would you live the rest of your life? Drugs Chocolate Ice Cream Chocolate Milk  Chocolate Milk Chocolate Ice Cream Chocolate Milk Chocolate Ice Cream  Chocolate Ice Cream Chocolate Milk Chocolate Ice Cream Chocolate Milk Chocolate Ice Cream Chocolate Milk Chocolate Ice Cream Chocolate Milk Chocolate Ice Cream Chocolate Ice Cream Chocolate Ice Cream Pineapple & Mayo Ice cream is my favorite. Yeah, this man is for sure not trolling But have you had great coconut ice cream? No, it's all awful because it's coconut Luna ice cream How I check I have never checked my body fat percent The most I do for my body fat percent is look in the mirror and guess I can't do more than that But First my favorite flavor is struck that you know, what kind of question is there? There's actually one thing that I arguably like more than chocolates White chocolates You What is a bistro Yes, I do this like coconut who likes coconut tastes like ass it actually tastes like poison Rum raisin Yeah Yeah, I've never seen that. Do you train legs? Of course I train legs Although I have a pretty fucked up knee injury right now. So I've not been able to train legs for like a week And my squat has really fallen behind because my knee injury has been there all the time My dad lets decent though, I can that look like 500 pounds I Was in character for me. Oh, it's chocolate is extremely basic and therefore in character for me. I see how it is Anybody comes to my stream to insult me like that's calling me a basic bitch You put mint chocolate He's just saying that to troll me no one actually likes toothpaste flavor Strawberry ice cream strawberry is pretty good Strawberries like chocolate. It's like eight here. I would say maybe chocolate caramel is S tier chocolates eight year and the strawberry is like beat here Vanilla is meant vanilla is like solid beat here as well. Maybe seat here Favorite fruit Apple I Don't like special talent that much it's just like little bits and pieces in it. It doesn't mix the textures weird Toothpick came to the world just to ruin mint flavor. I'm pretty sure they invented toothpaste first and then we're like Hmm, this shit's a buzzin. I love eating my toothpaste. What if we made this into an ice cream? You take those tea suggestions sure Fjord the latter Italian thing. I mean someone to be different so bad Yeah, my favorite ice cream is this, you know, you've never heard of it but that is my favorite ice cream I am that different I am very special The guy invented mint ice cream has been eating toothpaste since he was five I believe you You know I Can't find this Wikipedia article I would have tried to edit it to say that he's been eating toothpaste since he was five But I could not find the article unfortunately Did you eat bacon ice cream? No Sometimes when I dive I look straight up and as I said, it's so funny interesting These ice cream true true As I swallow my toothpaste sometimes I'm not surprised you like mint ice cream, of course you do I was assuming you do that sometimes Like you didn't tell me anything new just now I Intend to a Nestle column would go so hard. Why would they make the other? Fucking diamond mine tycoon Featuring Mario I Wait, these should have a different texture. I remember I Mario pastime spoon. I don't know what Mario pasta tastes like What the hell How is this happening That is fucked up It's still happening Pistachio lukuma lukuma waltz. What is this? I'm not interested in modern conquests now. I Do not like conquer  It is true awful that's like I do not drink I Wanna be at a hundred percent ability all the time I Is do you have an ice dishes that are the more learn bigger ones? No You may conquer but it's actually funny wait, so the game is not about poop anymore Would that be the month you just take out all the unfunny parts, I don't think that'd be much left I Think that's funny in an ironic way interesting theory I Couldn't W humor sure This guy wants to be special so bad, holy shit I Guess here is coconut true true What are you making Mario I Don't think what you need what happened Okay. So basically the thing is when I was doing squats money started hurting and I was like, well, I'm not gonna be a pussy I'm just gonna keep working out and then it started hurting a lot My squad is so behind everything else my bench one rep max is almost as much as my squad one but max That's fucked up, isn't it? Just cuz I keep like being so uncomfortable doing skits how my wrist is fine I How do you do lightning for the torches that's the end of Alex kind of shit dynamically, you know, I just do this in blender Why is the stream tactus gargoyle? Gargoyle on my nuts are she that's why oh my god. You fell for the long con everyone laugh at the switch user I Did Zemos pay you money for the contesters? He didn't even play the contest nights yet. If he played the contest nights, I would release it, like the Saturday following that. But he hasn't. I do wanna release my competition like real bad, but I just can't, cause ASA want me to wait until it's played on stream, so now we just have to wait. It is what it is. And it sucks. Is it a joke, heck no, Kanka and it's just all these nuts, true, true. It would be funnier than what we got, I will say that much. God, all these slight misalignments piss me off. Are you sure you would sleep with other Nintendo characters? I did not say that I would sleep with Yoshi. Maybe I would sleep with Apache Yoshi in my bed. As in he can sleep next to me. What I'm talking about is your rehab strategy, just some physio and rest. See every time I go to a doctor it gets worse, so I do not go to doctors anymore. Doctors actually just give you such shit advice. When I had a problem with my elbow, the doctor said we can insert cortisol into your elbow to fix it. That was his recommendation. Or I can give you a prescription for painkillers. He gave me a prescription for painkillers. What a shit advice. I just did physio and it worked. Just like use your fucking common sense, don't just eat a pill. Actually do not use your common sense, that is a bad idea. Unless you are capable of reading scientific literature and capable of doing research yourself, you should not use your common sense, you should just listen to the doctor. I reject my statement. I don't know what collagen powder is. You just never trust the doctor. Aren't you like at the doctor all the time? Isn't that like your second home at this point? That's true, I scramble, but that also happened in Germany. When I had an issue with my wrist in Germany, my doctor told me just eat painkillers and keep working out. And that completely fucked my wrist. That was terrible advice. I should have sued her for malpractice. This actually. At least I didn't have to pay. True, I did have to pay for the painkillers though. Because back then I was naïve and I listened to my doctor. Oh that's kinda cool Zeld. Zeelit, not Zeld. Always nice to have other developers watch my content. The best part about having other developers watch my content is I can just confidently say something wrong and they'll be like this is wrong and they'll correct me and then I learn. Isn't that insane? You know that law that if you want a question answered you shouldn't ask the question, you should just say something wrong and wait for someone to correct you? That applies to everything, including making good content. The FPS counter picture does not work. Any suggestions? Don't think so. What Hoshi? Never heard that quote, it's so true. Dang, you're not a programmer then. Okay so Shadow and Doctor is giving bad advice and responded to a bug report which just don't look at it. It's the Project 64 bug, okay? What do you want me to do? Fix Project 64 1.6, time travel back into the past and fix it? Look, the FPS count on Project 64 never works, let me show you. You see that? You see how it says 15 FPS? This is because Project 64 count cycles wrong. Jingle bell, jingle bell. Why is there a delta moon? Looks like 15 FPS to me, true. It says 15, it must be 15. Yeah, double checking your doctor seems fine. Cause you're gonna be able to dedicate 10 times as much time to your own health than your doctor can. So even if your knowledge is less, just through passion you can make up some of that and still make useful finds. See the thing is, okay what I used to do when I go to a doctor, I used to take out a piece of paper before I went there and I would write down the entire history, like dates of when which symptom appeared, what I tried to fix it and what happened afterwards, right? And you go to the doctor, you tell him here's my list of things I've already tried that didn't work and what happened and they think you're insane. They're like the fuck is going on with this guy? Is this guy a hypochondriac? He must be schizophrenic or something. Clearly he's just faking it. It's like I just did my homework. I just tried to fix it. Now I'm being punished for that. At least that's how it felt. Hello Blender. Nope. Merry Christmas. You're not allowed to think logically. Yeah. It was also a weird thing. When I had my wrist thing, the doctor like pushed down on my wrist and I instinctively pushed against it because it hurt, right? And then the doctor said well I can't move your wrist so clearly there's a blockage there. I was like no I pushed against it. She's like no no no there's some blockage there. No I pushed against it. I'm twice your weight. You are a frail little woman. I can just push against it. Yeah there's definitely good ones too. I don't want to trash them. They probably just are not as passionate about your health as you are. No it's free in Germany so that's not the issue unfortunately. Oh I use this texture here too. Interesting. That was my chance to take a big shit. True. They also have to go for 12 years I think it's especially sad in Canada because people that are good doctors are not allowed to be doctors and then because like they don't have the degree in Canada or something like that. I don't know how exactly it works. It is really sad. So the few doctors that actually exist have to do like five times as much work as they're like reasonably capable of and then they don't have actually the time to be passionate about your health. It's all just a shitty situation for everyone involved. It's Canada and I expect several only main cities. Canada is not that expensive. Yeah I imagine if you're Canadian it's very tempting to go to the US because the taxes are lower and the cost of living is lower. Germany is way more expensive than Canada because of taxes but it's also a lot cheaper to be poor in Germany and Canada being poor is like somewhat expensive. Holy shit Lila, do you have like a whole army of doctors? Weeo weeo weeo yeah that's that's how Lila's house sounds like. But the Canadian has some issues when it comes to the national election. They are lost and X percent of what TV station broadcasts has to be made by Canadians. I love shit like that. I wonder if that's related. I had no idea. Lila's house yeah because she lives in an ambulance. It goes weeo weeo weeo. She's always in the back door. Honestly if Canadians are forced to watch more Canadian YouTube content I'm fine with that because I am Canadian YouTube content. Just gives me another competitive edge. Free doctors. Oh only free. Pfft. Dr.Mixing Pfft. Hello can't I? Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what is this? What is going on here? There we go. You think a gen old is still gonna live with roommate in one room apartment? You will live in small pots and eat the insects or something, I don't know. Hello CuckyBuffer, yes, my hair has become very short. Hardest roaming I've ever worked on. Traumatic Tick Tock Tower, it's very difficult. Those are hella important, this is truth. I like how we can just discuss shit like that, and like stupid politics and stuff. I like just rambling on about those on stream sometimes. It's nice that no one is starting to cry and get upset. Pfft. It's kind of a bomb assist, I don't know. Do you really drink a camshake? Well the camshake is quark and milk. I used to be like, oh, no, in this place it's never been an issue, Hoshi. But I know that everywhere else on the internet, as soon as someone brings up something slightly political, people are like, can we not talk about politics? This is making people upset, I don't want to argue with people, I want to just relax. But it's like, just because politics are brought up, you don't need to argue with people. You can just eat shit out and be like, well, I disagree. Who cares, you know? I like arguing about everything, just because when you argue with someone, you learn more about other ways of thinking, and you become smarter, you know? It's just beneficial for everyone. Must I have a light mapping on NC4Hunter? Nope, it's all Linux colors. Thoughts on Pilk? Sprite and milk? I've had it before. It's actually not that bad. Or is it Pepsi and milk? I don't think I've had that before. But I feel like Sprite and milk is worse, so. I haven't checked any offensive opinions yet, don't get too comfortable. Alright. Fine. Y'all live in Corpium? Why? Why? What made you say that? Hello Tanya. I'm gonna texture this. Carbonated drinks are evil in the form of liquid. What? Lilaa is not a carbonated drink enjoyer? That is a huge surprise to me. I thought she was gonna be on the Coca-Cola all day. Coca-Cola, yes. That's how Lilaa would call it, if she was into it. Rhyme, isn't that the Logan Paul energy drink? You really think that lowly of me? Why not Monster? Isn't that just basically poison? Yes. It is basically poison, but we enjoy it. I want a 6 in that direction. I'm not sure. 2, 4, that's 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 10 should be here. That seems about right. Take 3 pills per day and drink from a plastic bottle. Do you think I'm scared of Monster? But drinking from a plastic bottle is fine for you, right? Because you're a girl. It's like feminizing hormones in there. It'd be different if you were a guy. Wait, there's hormones in plastic bottles that can feminize you, wait. There, most plastics reduce estrogenic side-effects upon childbirth and get dissolved. It's true. How the fuck did you pull that up so fast? Just google it. I didn't have that saved, I just entered that on google and it's the first thing that comes up. I thought that was common knowledge. I thought literally everyone knew.  How's that sus? As in sus you don't believe it or as in sus that I haven't pulled up? Oh, I just googled it. Why is the water gone? Because I pressed H. Does the top G drink in plastic bottles? Who is the top G? Keanu Reeves? Not Koomba. Oh, you're talking about Andrew Tate. Did you know that they knew cigarettes were harmful in like 1897 but the public didn't know until like 1950s and they hired a lot of doctors to tell you it's not harmful? Fun fact. No, no, no, this is the Divine Dino domain. So instead of being connected in the walls, wouldn't that allow safe on triangles or is overdraw a concern? Correct. Overdraw is much more of a concern than triangles. This might be green. It is pretty green. Aloe vera. Let's take a look. We'll go for the other area just so you guys can see what this is supposed to look like in the final. A long green area with a break. Look, okay, look, I'll show you. It's not green area or a break. Look, look, look. This is what it's going to look like. Green area with break and plant and flame. Isn't that nice? This is my idea. Plant and flame. No way. He didn't. He had a plant and flame to green break. I kind of don't like how dense the red coins feel there. It's better in stream than on the YouTube vids. The game. That's interesting. Hello, Yannick. The flames that aren't on the dodge are out of place. You think so? You think maybe that's not their final placement? Okay, so it is moving green break and green area with break. Yes. If you have any suggestions on how to make this better, I'm all ears. I do think it's kind of a vibe though. Ignore the broken ones here. This is what the outside looks like. The idea is this is like an abandoned temple. Maybe make it less green and more gray. That's going to fix everything. This guy's not crazy, but those moving break patterns look really bad. Yeah. Let me show you what the final intention for them is. So you can actually judge just properly. The idea would be that they look like this here. Is that still bad? You think? Is Eiza easier in next Lila? Hopefully. I'd rather have people like call me out on any mistakes. I make than have them not do that. It look really bad though. What? Even this one here. I kind of like it. I like the shape. The texturing itself looks really out of place. Interesting. You think it should look more scuffed maybe? Is that what you're saying?  Is that the criticism here? I have idea. You have idea. What idea you have? Okay. Man, the camera aligning of wallkicks is so useful actually. You see that I used the sides of the staircase part? The wood thing. Try a variant of that. You see that you used the sides of the staircase part? The wood thing. I have no idea what you're talking about. I have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, wait. I think they don't have fog. That might be why they look very out of place. Oh, you want them to be like wooden? Like this thing? Enjoy your pickup on Discord. Okay. But I am going to add fog to it. I'm going to add a multi texture to it. Make it look scuffed. And I'm going to add fog to it. Because I just realized that I don't have those things. Let's give it a try. Fog shade, opaque.  Something like this, maybe. I don't know. Although that is going to make it darker. Can I get a shout out? No. That makes it look a little more scuffed. Would it be better to scale the event breakdown by maybe 10-20% or so horizontally? Maybe? I don't know. Simpleflips has gotten enough shout outs from me. It's time to give those back. Oh, cool. Cool, cool, cool. I forgot. I forgot. This. What are you modeling for? Mario64, man. Mods. Well, it looks more scuffed now. I would say, like, still 80%. It's been at 80% for a while because I keep, like, changing old things. You mean all my boss fights have... All my roblox have boss fights? What kind of question is that? Red card in camera. Instead of instantly unpassing the game in the camera's perspective, why not leave the game suspended for a second like in Odyssey? Innocent idea, yeah. That sounds like a decent idea. Although, with the camera already always being aligned with the cards in camera now in this hack, I don't think it's as much of an issue. It actually looks stretched as well. May I rotate it?  You know, the palace at the end of the room. I was suggesting that texture. The flame ones? Oh, you sent me an image on... Discord. Use this. Oh, I don't wanna. I want a new texture. I want it to be brick. Sworing what word or purpose of the item you're making? Oh, this is just a platform to stand on. And platform on. It moves back and forth and stuff. You will see it in a second. There, I made it scuffed. And it now has fog, so it looks less out of place, hopefully. Oh no, I don't want the edges to be smoothed. I do like the hard edge here a lot. I don't know what you mean by a twice crunch. Smoothing edges always reduces triangles. Or keeps them the same. No bullying the dinos? I wasn't bullying any dinos. Okay, next I wanna add the holes for these. I think having the holes here will make it look significantly less shit. And then we can do the lighting for the area here. Wait, someone else sent me something? Oh, shake, you have an OST suggestion. Is that what it was? I'm smoothing it with CTRL-B. Oh god, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's expensive. Whenever Mario's pregnant starts and you get more stars, he gets more and more pregnant. That would be quite something, wouldn't it? I don't know. I don't know. I was never ashamed of my hair. Somebody bought it and he said they were both in the process of making it and he was lying. That, well, I can't believe Simply would break NDA like that. I have him sign a contract and everything. I guess we have to cancel it. Like, if Simply broke NDA, then the news is out that we're making a hack, we might as well cancel it.  So we can see the shapefile anyway? Alright, it's on this side. It looks too much like a Zelda dungeon. Interesting choice. I mean, it is a temple. Send pics of another suggestion on Discord. Also this. Oh, that is a good idea. Yes, I agree. That would indeed look better. That's right here. Good call. I don't know. I must have it somewhere else. Nope. I think it was right there. Yep. That's neat. Or i could use this piece here and put it right there i do spelling very awesome i noticed that now that you're 18 you're drinking is that what's going on so no i just cannot spell out let me try this piece here yeah i think i like this definitely should be the the other piece though definitely should not be bricks i think that's the main part here um right this is what i wanted to work on until i got distracted and the tumbleweed sign all right so these are signs for course 12 since we have not finished those yet Zayn just did a sign for a tumbleweed store so let's see we make this and not something on Unity because i wanna it'd be pretty easy to do this just in like Unity or something but that's kind of taking away the whole spirit of the challenge of like making something that runs on n64 i have heard of that game weeds yeah this is a pretty good sign i like it definitely looks like a tumbleweed store here interesting texture size i might need the full rest version of that because 64 by 43 is maybe a bit weird she also made two other ones let me pull those up real quick bang we got the koopa bank here pretty nice yeah you scaled it to 43 but it should be like 40 and milk bar the milk bar sign is really good look at this drawing on a wall like in a permanent mark 64 yeah but that sounds good yeah i like that tumbleweeds are sung on tumbleweep wait did it say tumbleweep the cow is missing eyes this is true factual information fact-checked by true american patreons 100 true  milk bar is that a male bathroom no it's a bar where you drink milk there's unity or an engine with accurate mark 646 it'd be very easy to just copy paste it it's like a few hours of work less than a day of work hello yes i'm still making my game it will come out one day hello clayman you should have cat gifts ready to go as overlays on your stream but wouldn't that distract from the stream do i need to share my love for cat gifts with everyone in class nobody has bought a doom to mario 64 yet it seems oh that could be free clouds can you actually get youtube cloud above that though i feel like there's really an interesting video you could make  r64 engine have triggers what what is the trigger do you think i should make a free hour far right clickbait view in order to get free cloud and jumps on my new career the video would just be a black screen for three hours i don't think that would work but you should do better if you want to be successful on youtube you just need to start more drama i've been thinking i should just start drama with the mario and unreal engine guy imagine how famous both of us would get she was not playing candy crush silent billy she was working on the mod with me and she's now upstairs working on the mod with me critical won't make a video about you if you did that exactly could you even hate on something like that i feel like at that point the drama isn't just about the drama anymore the drama becomes an art piece itself because by doing that drama and getting that many views you are showing society a mirror you are like it's not me that's it's you guys that are bad because you guys are enabling this behavior you guys are watching this shit you know what i mean i feel like very purposely starting drama just for that and then being very open about it afterwards that you did this on purpose to get views i feel like that's that's kind of a cool move if someone did that i would think that's extremely based your honor i was simply showing society and roads real real you know you're enabling my behavior judging me so it's kind of your fault so my army of waltz  yeah i think i like the way the section looks now so had it been like uploaded at the beginning of march i absolutely could have gone with that that would have been insane pretty autumnal but true i could just iterate every surface in the game and shine the camera on this where did the hair go where did the hair go they stole it off me the triangle vertices are well i'm properly making it a functional should there be near misses in that video though like walls that are not a wall even though they visibly look like a wall doing right now while the pen and i was still alive it's too good honestly it'd be so easy to put together too either that or honorable mentions at the end something that's almost a wall but not quite how long would that video even be i'm not sure if i was just a little more of a shit poster i would absolutely do it so my streams have always been people asking me to make stupid ideas it's just that usually the stupid ideas that are the case can you make super some random other game 64 please please case and this time it's like make this shit post so it's amazing on just never ends the human creativity is never ending anyone have that image of the cat like doing a baseball hoop and it says the abdominal human spirit above it wait Biobak do you still have that image of the far at the video of the fork i wanted to send it to someone but i forgot where it was the heck are you talking about dude it's a banger image when i was attacking the reason why you went before the in-game instead of drawing walls like pen and go with it um it's less work and i wanted to do it real quick the video of the fuck yes the fuck in the pc port in wet dry world when i just drew a bunch of planes that one excursion of the map done from the geometry or you make your collision by hand it's done from 3d geometry but i usually modify it you can just go by intuition like a spoon it's usually pretty obvious and when something is like close to being a wall but not quite i can still just kind of move the vertices so that it's definitely a wall you know it's really not that difficult to make sure that there's not holes in the level geometry why so many of these walls in the game not because of holes or because of unintended walls but rather because of x post floors corner misaligned vertices that's usually what's plaguing romhacks so at least that's where most invisible walls in my romhacks came from so these ones i will murder you hoshi this is your last day on earth i still don't see what people are saying with last impact invisible walls i still just don't think there are that many i think it's completely overblown or do you think they actually are that many mushy i just don't really see it i just found this case jet banger from years ago so i don't know i just suddenly believe there are quite a few but i don't think it's like a disproportionate amount compared to other romhacks i don't know i don't think it's like a disproportionate amount compared to other romhacks  also you probably play like 1.0 right 1.2 has the invisible wall fix so that is the version i'm talking about so because i'm pretty sure it takes like every invisible wall that was known at the time of release so there couldn't possibly be that many so we got i should have just cheated the collision more hydrothermal winds perfect now that i have a foundation it's time to make some doom style music aka oh we have some options and anybody may though is i want to stay as atonal as possible through the whole song without it sounding terrible let's start by adding some distortion to our random thing what the fuck i'm listening to we'll lay out the drums now too time for a little guitar and bass add some cool sound effects it's just doom isn't it and of course the little cherry on top okay all done enjoy the crazy bus main menu theme of doom oh and it's doom so this sounds good so Hey, Mick. If you see this video, I'd love to chat sometime. Okay, see ya. What's up, Mick? Yup, thank you for the donation, HiNote. And the subscription. Back to Mario Kart. Like if one gets the Doom. I feel like that's false. Mick Gordon made the Doom OST. Oh, I see. Wirecode is so stacked, pick one stat. It is what it is, dude. You're not maxing all your IRL stats if you don't look like this. I've spent my days sitting in a room on diet of rice and eggs. You can still get jacked on rice and eggs. You just need to work out. You see that behind me? That's a bench press. There's 243 pounds there. You go and you lift and wait. Just get up like once an hour and do a bunch of sets. Do like 10 reps, you're done. All you need to do. It's like not even 1% of your life. Is the Mario Kart being released? When it's done. It's a game. Kaze sacrifices ability to raise his voice by more than 3 decimals. I am very good at yelling. I just don't do it. Kaze doesn't train legs. That's false. I do train legs. I can dablift 500 pounds. Do you know why the decimate condition service also flows based on angle instead of being defined in condition type of material or anything but angle? It's easier to just have it work automatically, right? Why would you want to have to define it all manually? That sounds painful. I mean 25 push-ups. That's well above population average, I'm sure. The average person can probably do like or the median person can probably do like two or three push-ups, right? With good form. He's doing half reps. It's very likely. If someone who doesn't work out tells you they do a high number of like push-ups, they're most likely half repping. But even 25 half reps is still well above population average. I'm doing at least 15 at a time. Well, that's still above population average. I think before I worked out, I could only do like five or six. I was very very skinny before I started working out. Well, squats are always easy, Hoshi. But that makes sense. You're a girl. Of course, you're saying there's going to be more on your legs. That's an insane deadlift. It's still go higher. I want to be able to bench like 400 pounds. That's when I'll be happy. Actually, I'm already happy. Hello, DarkKweese. I think it has subservient function as a wall, which means you don't really have a case where you have to remove robotics and it ends up as a surface. Yeah, but then you iterate twice as much. I generally think that doing some physical exercise, like in the middle of your 3D modeling or whatever, is good though. Because it keeps your brain fresh. It keeps you more focused. I think I'm more productive like that. You don't get the brain fog. So, yes, I cannot pronounce the word fog. It doesn't work. I have to try really hard to be like fog. So don't say it sounds like I'm saying fog. But apparently, somehow Americans cannot tell the difference between me saying fog and fuck. And I don't know why. This is awful. Fog. So, so, let me see. Fog, it sounds more like, if it's something in the accent and I can't say why, but it just does.  Okay, what texture shall we use for this? Is Donkey Kong gonna be a playable character? What do you think? Just give me a wild guess here. I need to say frog like that frog. Try putting more emphasis on the R. The R in fog. That doesn't help. The R in frog. Yeah, there's a frog in my pond. What the fuck, Poro? I feel like you made it worse. You say the G way better in frog than fog. Interesting. It's supposed to be inside the temple. Frog. Is that how you do it? So, so, I think this kind of works. It's a little better. So, you're gonna share the glass with a weeaboo and that kind of ruined anime for you? Well, okay. You shouldn't let someone else being cringe about something you like ruin the thing for you. You should just do your own thing, right? So, Dan is working on a game where Donkey Kong is playable. Y'all know Dan? It's like a pirate game and you can switch between Donkey Kong and Mario anytime you want. Whereas Dan, you wouldn't know him. I think collect-a-thons are really easy to make entertaining. It's just that all the collect-a-thons that exist kind of fucking suck. I hate video games. Sorry. At a moment there. Why is he such a hater? I hate video games. Do you have time for a song request? We can do one, I think. When video games die, where's Dan Wilbonic playing Turo? Dude, Skyloft, someone shared the funniest screenshot of you in chat just a bit ago. And you weren't here for it. Oh, you saw it coming out. Oh, I guess I missed you being in chat. I don't know how I missed that. Awesome. So, why is this going on? Face Corner Color. And did you do the song request? Can you send me the song then? Because I don't see that from here. Why is it doing this? Face Corner Color. Face Corner Color. How? They are the same thing. What kind of bug is this? Oh, that would do it. Meow, meow, meow, meow. Oh, how does this cast that? There we go. You like the thumbnail of the newest YouTube video? That's good. So, you know, put a lot of work into that one. Damn, this video is going hard. This might be a contender for number one. You always say that. Okay, Lilaa, I'm sorry I'm not depressed and pessimistic. You know what? Surely this will still drop down to 10th place. Who would want to watch a stupid video like mine? I don't know.     I don't know.     I'm gonna add lighting to the Yoshi. Does he not have lighting? If he doesn't, then yes. But I think this was all made after the lighting was already in. So surely he should have lighting. It works. Oh, no. I feel like people are gonna climb up here and then just do that. Oh, no. People are so bad at Mario 64. They do that. I need to move this closer. So that's less likely to happen. There we go. That should hopefully make that a little bit better. Stop. Let the player feel. It's course two. Skill issue, yeah. But we have to deal with that. Either way, I'm done for today. I will see you guys in the next stream next Saturday. Bye-bye.
