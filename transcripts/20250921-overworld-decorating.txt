Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello, Selton? Hello, Shane? What's up? Not much. Look what I made today. This coin here. Not collected yet, but isn't that a fucking cool looking coin? Yum yummy. Any OST wishes for today? I'm gonna work on Pandora's box for now. One big ass coin? Yeah, so I was thinking. We make these giant coins. And they're gonna be super rare in the game. They're only gonna be in super secret easter egg sections. Thank you for the sub, Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm thinking this will give you like 500 coins. Yeah, this is literally the coin from Mario Odyssey, if you're wondering. I just took the coin from Mario Odyssey and imported it. And remade its shader. At least, kind of. The rim is not the same. The rim is just a texture I made up. They will save to your game, tea time. Like, they will be like, you collect them once, you can never collect it again. But, there will be no unique reward and there will be no hint that they even exist in the game. I mean, it looks like a normal map, but it does have a normal map. It doesn't just have a normal map, it also has a roughness map. Maybe Yona? Well, it's honestly a really lame trick. It's just, use a bunch of computational power to render it. But it works. No, the big coin is in-game and it runs fine on N64 too. I can show you. Oh, nevermind, I can't show you. Not without risking my stream crashing. I guess we're gonna risk the stream crashing. Hey, it didn't crash. Oh, there's some color bleeding here. Okay, I know what's happening. That's a relatively easy fix, but it's gonna make the coin a little ugly on emulator. But it doesn't, like, kill the framerate or anything. No, we're not adding this as a collectible! No! No! It will be a thing you can collect, but it will not be officially hinted at by the game. This will not count towards 100%. Why is the FPS 20? It is not 20. It's, like, 45 in that area. Oh, that's not a GPU thing, pants. What do you do as a professional? I program games. Why was the gunner saying 20? Because it averages the last 800 frames and the game hadn't been run for 800 frames. So it does count it as 0. Well... No, it's not a shader. It's a... I don't even know what you would call it. I mean, I would call it a shader, but it's not a shader, right? Yeah, so these kinds are going to be in super rare easter egg locations. So... I imagine a lot of players will play the game without ever seeing one. And that's good. I want it that way. That's where I see requests. I have done exactly that. What is your suggestion? Reminds me of the big stars in B-3313. Is that a good or a bad thing? Mr. Krabs first time. Hello, Alstair. No music? I think you have a suggestion, Moldy, but I think no. People complain when I have no music on stream. I have no music. I have no music. I have no music. No music. I have no music. There is a loud vibrating sound that is pissing me off. There is a loud vibrating sound that is pissing me off. There is a loud vibrating sound that is pissing me off. I fix it. The sound is gone. Where is Kayne Saylor-Neella? Ultrakill OST? Okay. Oh no, the Vy'Kesa went off. What is the Vy'Kesa? I hear nothing. Oh, it's just very quiet. Okay. Okay. I'm going to watch a 30-minute video just about the Odyssey coin. Do you want to see a video about the coin? It only took me a few hours to make. It's honestly nothing impressive or even special. But I could make a video about like the best N64 shaders and mention it. Do you want to have an expansion pack? Yeah, then you can't play Mario 64 Romex. That's unfortunate. Can you believe it? The first top 10 video on the Kay's channel. Actually, it would be the second because I already uploaded top 10 Gooby Woobies. I'm not saying this is nothing special to be like, oh, I'm so smart, I can do this any day I want. I'm saying that because genuinely, it's just nothing I should be praised for. It's lame as hell. Do you guys know those redditors that are like, oh, when you're too smart, life sucks. Life is so difficult. You're too intelligent to talk to other people. Oh my god. We need to like, do something about that. Being smart is awesome. And if someone tells you it's not, then they are probably not that smart. I hate cats. Do you have tips for making your own custom textures? No. That home concert was fantastic. Oh, nice. In my face? No, not my face. Sorry that the ROM hit it's limit. It did not. You have autism? Thank you for letting us know, Sarah. Why did you say that? And a squishy stash. Okay, so this is gonna be Pandora's box. This is where the booblas come from in Overworld 3. Oh yeah, now that more people are here, look at the sexy coin, look at the sexy coin. Look at it, look at it. Do you see it? It's from Aria Odyssey. How cool is that? I didn't know the other day for the first time in years that unhovering expenses gifts were full of autism meme shit, it was so surreal. Yeah. So the way it's going to work is this is the box, you destroy it, first time it speaks to you, the second time it's supposed to die and set a save flag, and then all the booblas spawn in. The coin? 96. It is one to one important from Odyssey. My least favorite 3D Mario? Does 3D Land count or 3D World? Because if they count, then it's Mario Sunshine. Is this supposed to be a quest box? Yes. I don't think he has a memory issue, I think he has a skill issue if I'm being honest. So I don't know how to solve it because I don't know which specific skill issue he went into. The happy mole in World 3? There is no happy mole in World 3. Did I fuck up something? Oh, I forgot about this. This is Zayna's fucked up file that auto-merges by distance when you do anything. So I can't actually close the box and I don't know how to turn it off. Let me figure out how to turn it off. Hello Badoob, thank you for the resub. Look Badoob, I'll show it again for you. Look at the coin. Who likes auto-merge by distance? Why was this on? It's very big. Well, the size of a map doesn't increase its memory, right? Whether you import a single cube or a single cube at scale 2 million, the memory is the same. There we go, auto-merge turned off. What is the big coin for? We have a lot of e-stack areas in this game and there are some where I don't have anything fitting yet. So I was thinking in those we just slap one of these big bad boys down. It will give you like 500 coins to your save file. They will save so you can't collect them twice. And the idea is these are going to be really cool to find, first of all. But also this makes it so that if there are speedruns of this game, instead of having to farm coins, they will have to farm e-stacks, which is so much cooler. That sounds like maybe he doesn't know how to do areas, which I don't know when he made it. But a long time ago it was not possible to do different areas unless you were really good at what you're doing, modding-wise. Yeah, I really want to prevent speedruns from farming coins. Just recently I finished all of the first third of the overworld. I put in all the levels together and I noticed that I had to farm coins to make progress at some points, so I want to get rid of that issue. It just collects like a regular coin and never gets mentioned again. Mark 64 only supports 1 and 0, weight painting-wise, and I have not added any more support than that. What do you think about how speedrunners are playing the game? Speedrunning is essentially like a replay experience, right? And I do care about replayability, so by thinking about replayers I believe I am also thinking a lot about speedrunners. Most people who are interested in this will probably complain that I am such a slow worker and can't keep up with the world, plus I've been constantly süldrying for years. But when I played with the team, it really packed me in. I've been keeping this budget up to date. I think I updated it like two days ago. Oh my god, Lila? Lila, are you here? You see this shit? This is an issue. Very sad. Is that our merch? Oh yeah, I'm wearing Shadow the Hedgehog. I guess I just have to type in 5 and I can't just type in 1. That sucks. Two and a half hours of conversation about this game that I received a few months ago that was super interesting. I was going to post it in the server but never got around to it. Oh. You know what, we'll do it like this. 0 and 1 and they decide to 2-layer us. Huh? What is this? Found a new bug? Okay, I guess we can't proceed here. We can't proceed here. I'm going to post a screenshot in the Flash64 server. Hmm. I don't even have an idea as to what could be the issue. Sigh. Somehow. How hard can it be to recreate those 10 stars? Deleting color attributes? I don't want to delete color attributes. Okay. That was not a good hint. Hello, Twelo. So I remember before the decomp came out, this is like 2013 to 2018, I kept stats on hacks that were made and there were 12 different beta recreation attempts. Well, in just those five years. And all of them got cancelled. No, no, no, I want them to go after RTYI. As soon as they go after RTYI, I am free. I can turn this into my own game and sell it. This is also a Nova64 bug. It exports the wrong path here. What the fuck is this? Okay, that's actually used. They do after RTYI. Rollog through the fields. That is a long-time all-star. That's just around when Lost Impact released. This LST doesn't sound very old, it sounds more like Peace and Harmony. I am glad you like them. We will keep going no matter what. Oh, we need a collision from Pandora's box. Hmm, it opens up, so... Okay, wait, actually, we need to think about how it opens up too. So you just kick the front, maybe? I am going to be in a box again, this is what unleashes the ghosts. That was well enough. Right, this fucking thing again. How do you use it? I missed the export button. Okay, that wasn't that bad. How do I control whether it loops? Did that work? Dude, what happened to Intellisense? It doesn't work at all anymore. Every time I try to look for a definition, it just does this. Oh, I guess it works, it's just incredibly fucking slow. No, it will not spit out a coin. It's not from something either. I hate them, I will eat them all. The thing is, technical stuff you can just measure. You can just measure it's good or it's bad. Game design is very subjective, you cannot just say this is better. So in order to make a video about game design, you need to first prove that you have made a fun game. And then you can talk about the fun game you've made. And because the game is not released yet, I can't really do that. But if you just start talking about what makes game design good, you end up being a fucking game maker's toolkit. I can't stand the guy. No front, I just can't stand him. He seems too presumptuous to me. And that's the issue. There's no proof he's not presumptuous, right? If he had made a game that people liked a lot, then there would be a difference. Have you tried Clank's extension? I have not. We need one extra frame of nothing in here. Just for this way of handling it to work. Hello Samuel. Have you seen the meme with the spikes making fun of that kind of game design video? I have not. What? What? What's the function called? What? It has a terrible name. We need to find a different name for that. Yeah, I guess it's fun. Did you work on Hat in Time? I didn't work on Hat in Time. You made a Mario game recently that seemed pretty cool. It did a pretty cool feeling to me, but I think it's more of an outstanding. Should I say that every game has a game design issue? Mind Over Magnet did it pretty well. I'd say he's well-loved. He's definitely well-loved, I just don't like him personally. I didn't think Mind Over Magnet was really that good either, to be fair. It would be very nice to have auto-complete. This usually has auto-complete, but it broke and I don't know how to fix it. Okay, we need a collision for this. I think for the collision, we just make a new mesh completely. Baby's first game, but actually polished instead of releasing with devart. Yeah, I can kind of see it. I mean, it was probably not a bad game, but it was not good enough to the point where I can accept the alpha. It's like the authority on game design that should be making videos about how to game design, right? You can't just write the book on a topic that you don't know. And when you have a video like that about game design, it's kind of like writing the book on it. So it seems a little much to me to have a channel like that without first proving yourself to the degree where that's appropriate. Someone like Shigeru Miyamoto could make that YouTube channel, because he actually has the credentials. Although I guess that does leave the question, who do I think can make a video like that? Who actually would be interested in making a video like that? Because I assume the people that actually do have the skill where I would accept them talking about the subject, they have better stuff to do at the time. So maybe I am being a little unfair. I believe the patch from will stay under 64MB even with Biobank saving anything. But most of the room space is audio anyway, so this is not a Biobank problem. Sakura, I made some really good videos. Yeah, I've watched a little bit of Sakura's channel. That's true, yeah, Sakura is a perfect example, you should be making videos like that. I don't mind his channel at all. It doesn't come across as presumptuous at all when he makes those. Actually, you know what, you don't have to come across as presumptuous if you just make videos like that. You could post your things as theories instead of saying this is how it is. No, that's what's pissing me off. Actually, now that I think about it, yeah. He's like, oh, good game design is when you have a simple mechanic and then you kind of mix it up three times and now you have a perfect game. Yeah, fucking no. Nevermind, I have changed my stance. Nevermind, I have changed my stance. Has it finished all your courses? Yes, the course is amazingly all done, it's just all about now. Huh, I think I got the rotation basically right. I think you need to make a game to understand good game design. Yes. I didn't say that. Amiguin isn't it? Well, it would certainly help if you could prove that what you're saying has any substance if you're going to make definite statements. Why is it doing this? Amiguin wasn't positive? About what? Well, you could, for example, post your stuff as theory instead of being like, this is how it is. That would already help a lot. Did you make the box? I mean, it looks a little different, no? Oh, what's the weird comment? Bro, what the fuck am I doing? Where is the thing I'm looking for? Is it this? No. I don't get it, man. G, why are you lying to everyone and telling your ex that's not a thing anymore? Just be honest. Okay, how do I fix this? I thought quaternion mode could fix it, but no. Xena, your blender file is set up so weird. Wait. I found the quaternions, I'm saved. Quaternions, my beloved. Quaternions. Dude, at some point it was a thing and somehow it stopped? I think... I think the cultural perception is that, like, up till 2020 or so, you had to be like, passing the Vogue exam to be able to exist online. And now you don't anymore, so you can be transphobic again. I think that's the thought behind it. I don't know. What implies you considered it to be a thing previously? Yeah, because you had to pass the Vogue exam before 2020. I think that's the idea. I don't know. I usually don't say that, but I don't know. Go ask him if you're so curious. They say, like, you no longer have to pretend to be okay with it. Yes! They think that. They say, like, you no longer have to pretend to be okay with it. Yes! They think that. So I wound up like that? What do you mean? I don't know. Bomji, hi! Did I not export the thing? Oops. Where did my collision go? Where did my collision go? Was there a thing to them? No, not necessarily. No, not necessarily. I can't get enough of my coin. It's so nice. I love this coin. Every single pixel. Every single pixel. The Vogue left, without saying goodbye. The Vogue left, without saying goodbye. Interesting. That's not the vertex order in Gaphix. Or, bone order. I think that's better. I think that's better. It's called begging the question, I think. Or it's very adjacent to that. Oops, I clicked the ROM too early. Bro, what? I can't look at my box? What's wrong with it? Phew, that was close. Phew, that was close. Phew, that was close. Let's try a different model ID. That might be an issue, actually. I'm using weird model IDs here. I don't think this is the issue, but I wanna try this anyway. And after that I wanna try the animations. Let's try some grounds, okay. Let's try some grounds, okay. 161 Oh, we definitely don't need a shadow on this. Oh, we definitely don't need a shadow on this. Oh, we definitely don't need a shadow on this. Women don't exist in the back 25. Finally. What the hell? I'm gonna have to use my good emulator to look at this. I'm gonna have to use my good emulator to look at this. I don't have a really custom audio engine, I don't have a really custom audio engine, so I don't really know what you mean. Huh? It just works? Oh, something weird about this block here. Oh, something weird about this block here. What are we looking at here? What are we looking at here? Despawn if Vario ensue? Despawn if Vario ensue? Oh wait, no, that's 6HC. Oh wait, no, that's 6HC. Pandora's Box. Geo Pandora's Box. This is crashing. This is crashing. Oh, so. Unstoring to V1. Unstoring to V1. ORV1R0R0. ORV1R0R0R0. Do you all see this code? Do you all see this code? VR0 into V1 VR0 into V1 and then it just crashed, for some reason. Oh. Oh. Oops. The one that's crashing. Oh. Can you see I'm not supposed to try and follow, no? It's too bad for you. Okay, it's a little small. Okay, it's a little small. Okay, it's a little small. I was thinking like twice the size. I was thinking like twice the size. But it looks great. But it looks great. Hmm. Animation didn't play. Guess I didn't set it to 1, cool. Guess I didn't set it to 1, cool. Dude, I still wanna finish my AI Mario and have AI Mario run on my second N64. and have AI Mario run on my second N64. How's my game still fit into a 64MB cartridge? How's my game still fit into a 64MB cartridge? That's half the point. Can I get a link for your Margex patch? No, I don't have it. I bet you want to find a Grim Reaper I bet you want to find a Grim Reaper Okay, Leela, you can't be talking to me Okay, Leela, you can't be talking to me like I'm the one supporting death. You remember what happened like a week ago? I saw you support death vocally in Mario Gems. vocally in Mario Gems. Yeah, the human social instinct Yeah, the human social instinct is the strongest tool for manipulation is the strongest tool for manipulation that the media and us, each one of us, has. that the media and us, each one of us, has. It's so easily exploited. I'm still 100% convinced I'm still 100% convinced that Flat Earth Conspiracy started as a manipulation tactic to put out such a dumb conspiracy theory to put out such a dumb conspiracy theory that everyone in the future who would have any kind of conspiracy theory who would have any kind of conspiracy theory would have their social instinct hijacked by calling him a Flat Earth Idiot or a Conspiracy Theory Idiot that they would just not believe any conspiracies anymore because they just wanted to be as far away from Flat Earth Conspiracy Theories as possible. from Flat Earth Conspiracy Theories as possible. You were having a rough time? You sounded like you were having a great time last week. I do not know anything about QAnon. I do not know anything about QAnon. That whole thing means nothing to me. That whole thing means nothing to me. Yeah, exactly. They made the straw man real so they didn't have to make a straw man fallacy anymore. That's a good way to put it. You better start believing in straw man fallacies, boy. You are living in one. You better start believing in straw man fallacies, boy. You are living in one. I'm having too much fun. I'm having too much fun. I'm having too much fun. Hello, Beck? Hello, Beck? Oh my god, Leela! I'm gonna go insane! From this buck here. They wanted to flood out of my face by Pete but I live in Texas so, I guess, it's to be expected. But I live in Texas so, I guess, it's to be expected. Are they real, though? Or are they like someone's pretending they're real? What do you mean this is not a bug? It's supposed to do this? It's supposed to export the wrong path? It's supposed to export the wrong path? So that you can't compile anymore? So that you can't compile anymore? No one complained that the game doesn't compile No one complained that the game doesn't compile after the export from Fast64 anymore? after the export from Fast64 anymore? How is that supposed to be correct? It's clearly in the wrong folder. You export to a subfolder and then ask for the file on the main folder. You export to a subfolder and then ask for the file on the main folder. They're definitely real. I believe you they're real. But I think they're over-represented by a factor of like a hundred. What is your folder layout? It's the normal decomp one. I show you. I show you. Levels, I export to Castlebrowns. Levels, I export to Castlebrowns. And here's all the ink files and stuff. And here's all the ink files and stuff. And then neatly organized into folders is the other stuff. And where's the folder? It's right here. Pandora's box. How is that correct? How is that correct? Look at this. Leveldata.c has to go to... Leveldata.c has to go to... Oh wait. Oh, there's no relative path in here. That's the issue. Yeah, I don't know why there's no relative path enabled. Yeah, I don't know why there's no relative path enabled. Maybe that's like a new decomp edition that's not in there in my build. That makes sense. But why does it not work on my decomp? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. That is a factor too. That is a factor too. That is a factor too. That is a factor too. It's weird it works on Hacker. It's weird it works on Hacker. Yeah, well, the non-duplicate thing, that works at least. So I can fix it after when I export. It's a bit of an annoying issue, because I have to always export twice now. ... I don't know. Maybe. ... Oh, I completely forgot about the animation table, but. But that's good. It broke on your birthday! No, not on your birthday! ... ... ... ... ... Okay, it's obviously not supposed to always be that color. So that's an issue. ... ... ... ... ... ... Okay, next, I think we wanna make it so that it only is an issue if you hit it from the front. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Let's print opacity... I'm not gonna reference Ghostbusters, I don't reference other media in general, but especially not Ghostbusters Yes, yes, it looks correct And I do think it should be like that I think the issue is that my Decom repo is not set up for it And I don't know if the general Mario 64 repo was set up for it Is that 25? Or is that 0? Um... We are multiplying by primitive color for Alpha too, so... The issue has to be in the Geo But it's not Unless we are setting primitive color somewhere else We're not. What the fuck? Okay Hmm Interesting Oh, it's the other color, come on Hmm I've been trying to run this level, but it's not allowing me to use the full path This should allow level editor to actually update the custom menu Hmm Yeah, I mean, I think the DM issue is just that my Decom repository was not set up for it Well, that makes sense, I've had the issue since August Maybe since I last updated Wasn't that long ago Okay, so we now have it open, we have a talk to Mario, we need the proper dialogue Maybe there needs to be an intro dialogue too, but actually this is just one star, so I actually kinda don't need it I don't know what it means to have your bread out, is this metaphoric or something? What would Pandora's box say? There should be ghosts, I think something Yes The idea is that the ghosts try to get you to do it again Hmm Okay, this has to be a cutscene and then after the cutscene there is a text Okay, this has to be a cutscene and then after the cutscene there is a text Okay, this has to be a cutscene and then after the cutscene there is a text You fool! You've cursed this land You fool! I don't know I'm not a writer Thanks for watching! I need to find a tester for the RTYI demo. I have finished the entirety of the first demo, so I need someone to play through it. And then once they've played through it, we're good. You know what, that's not what I wanted. I want something else here. This is what I want. So the thing with the overworld 1 thing is, I need someone to actually come to my house to play it, because I don't want to send the ROM to anyone over the internet. There's too much content in there to risk a leak. So I need someone in the Halifax region. Not sure how I'm doing that yet. Also I nerfed the umbrellas. They no longer go crazy when you jump on them. I know, how sad. UKW? What's that? You know weather? I should switch from sorry. Is that what it means? That's good. So now when that happens, we also need a storm of ghosts just coming out of there. How do we visualize a storm of ghosts coming out? We need like... Can I unhide one? So what game have I played and the best game I've played? The worst one is for sure Blue Star Adventure. I don't know what the best one is. But Blue Star Adventure is terrible. It has giant levels and you just long jump 50 times to get anywhere. It is so miserable. The funniest part is the author is always talking about how it was the best game ever. It was very funny. Do you have a ribbon function? Look at the cigarette spread tower that has a VC3. Let's see that. Maybe it's somewhere? I don't have a ribbon function. Oh, this is nice. Oh, I like the ghost coming out of this too. We can do that with scrolling textures. We can even make that part of this rig if we want. Should I make this part of this rig? No, let's not. Let's make a new one. How do... was it right click? What's the button for it? Ah, shit, right click. What if the ghosts just came out along those lines and it just rotated while you did it? So we'd have a scrolling texture and they would also like rotate like this. So you would see ghosts coming out in all directions. We just need a ghost texture and then we've got it. I think that's gonna look great. I need water. I'll be right back. You guys go find me a ghost texture or something. I'll be right back while I get water. Hello. I thought Dutch oven is like when you fart and then put the other person into your fart. Anyway, this looks great and I want a ghost like this. These are kind of nice. It's named after the cooking device. Oh, I see. This one's too spooky. These are nice. If you're playing another game with an enemy, what's it meant to be played on? What do you play? I don't know. I don't think it would be any of those. That's kind of nasty. There's a couple nice ones in here. But I just need one. One good one that isn't too distorted. That one's too scary, or is it? This one? I like this one. This one looks mischievous. I need to learn how to use GIMP properly. The transparency is part of the image. I need to sign up on this website to get the Taktra. Awesome. Error, a username with discount already exists. I need to enter my credit card to get this Taktra. I'm thinking not. Send me the image, I can make something real fast. Let's see what you can do. I love fake transparent images. They are so good. I love eating asbestos. Asbestos is so tasty. Asbestos is my best friend. We love mulch. Mulch gang. Hello, Mel. Asbestos true. Let's make notes from the image you liked. Yes, this one here. Bottom left, second from the left. What does it mean? Technically, asbestos is just silicon dioxide, and that is in fact an ingredient in a lot of pre-packaged food. Really? That sounds technically very wrong. There is no way asbestos is technically just silicon dioxide. I don't believe it. That's gotta be some technically salt-is-just-nitrium-chloride fact. Which is false. Salt-is-not-just-nitrium-chloride. It's all just atoms, man. You don't know that. You're gonna buy it? Okay. What is asbestos? Asbestos is a naturally occurring group of six minerals known for their heat-resistant and insulating qualities. It's a group of naturally occurring toxic materials. There are six types, all of which are composed of long and fibrous fibers. Yeah? Well, I can probably use a water texture here. Like a waterfall. You're doing the comic level where you were thinking about who must be your child? Uh, no. Hmm. Hmm. Can I play video games as a kid or do you play movies? Um... I think I started playing video games when I was like four or five. But I was only allowed to play very little. Okay. Now we just need the texture. I forgot something. We need to be able to fade this in and out. You know what? It can just scale up. We're good. We're good. It's fine. Hello, Siak. Darlingki. So when I was playtesting Overworld 1, I think I noticed a memory leak in the game. It's not a very important one, but there seems to be some memory leaking. Which does suck a little bit. I'm sure I can fix it. Is the mesothelioma animation memory and asmr asbestos mine? Sure. Hmm. Hmm. I think that's the obj scale function. Obj scale. Do I not have that? Is it called scale obj? It is. I still have some old decom function names that are kind of messed up. It's all over the place, so it's sometimes hard to find functions. So now the ghost should pop in. Is scale in? Do they need to rotate still? Let's see what it looks like before we have to texture. Nothing. Oh, there they are. They are a little small. And the z fighting is atrocious. Why are they so small? I guess my scale up animation is too slow. Oh, you sent me the textures, Eina? Nice. Okay, well, you made a nice texture. It's not exactly what I had in mind. Let me see if I can make the modifications I need in GIMP. First of all, it needs to be... And then I want this to go down here. So why can I not use a proper brush in GIMP? What is going on here? Why is this brush like no falloff at all? Clearly it has falloff in the image here. Does anyone know how to fix that? Not fade length, I've tried that before. I don't know what that does. Smooth stroke? Nope. Can I have this down? Nope. Ah! What if I can do this and then blur? I mean, that kinda works, but it's a stupid way of doing it. Let's run into a new object if you're aware of Thousand Year Door. Oh right, this exists in Paper Mario and Thousand Year Door, right? What does this do in Paper Mario? I forgot. This does seem like a gag thing would happen in Paper Mario. Hello, Caiman. The sequel to Halloween Man? No! Okay, I don't like the color influence from Texture 1 here. Oh wait, actually I like it. But it needs to be turned down. Eh. Makes no sense. I guess it kinda makes sense. So something like this? Oh my god, Blender is so slow again. And then we have the ghost come out of here like, You opened Bandora's box! Don't you regret your decisions? I think this could look really good. The main ghost texture might just be too bright. I guess that also influences the artwork channel. Yeah, that's gonna look nice. Okay. The rotation part should just be always here. Yeah, this part should just always be here so I don't have to repeat it three times. It's stupid if I have to. Alright, let's try it. Where's the ghosts? Oh, because they're not active during time stop. Okay. They also need a much bigger culling radius, because the behavior doesn't assign them one. It can't be any size, because it's only cutscene anyway, and they're never active when they're offscreen. Just needs to be a size. And they need no shadow. This is actually a pitfall in my engine. When you spawn an object, it doesn't reset its graphics state. So if the object you spawn has a visual model, then the behavior needs to assign it a shadow scale. Otherwise you get weird shadows that a memory leaked from a previous actor that was in the same spot. It's just not coming out until this frame. That's weird. Oh. I could do a Gua Ha Ha or something at the start of the second text so it sounds sarcastic instead of actually sad and angry. But it's not supposed to sound angry. Okay, yeah, I see what you mean. There, now it has a ghost laugh. Yeah, exactly. They're like, you fool. Actually, yeah, they do say you fool. Wait, of course, yeah, okay. I do see how they can be like, oh no, you ruined our lives, but no, it's like, oh no, you ruined your life. Activate initiated time stop. Wait, what? Oh. I used the wrong commands. So let me take a train in and out of school because I couldn't stand most of the members. That's nice. Taking a train sounds a lot cooler than taking a bus. I saw it, Samuel. It looks kind of nice, but where's the Yoshis? Return to Yoshis Island, right? Where are the Yoshis? Okay, okay, okay, okay. It's very improvable. For one, it's way too small. For two, this texture is not visible at all. Probably because I increased the influence of primitive color halfway too much. And made the texture too dark. Because the preview is so inaccurate. Okay. Yes, we're working on it. Good idea. I should reduce the width at the bottom. Let's try this. Oops, my N64 was stolen. It's obviously terrible. They come out way too late, too. They don't go big enough. Looks like this one is just stuck in place for some reason. I'm working on it! When you're about to put the dishes away, and then your mom's like, and you're like, fuck you, mom! Don't tell me what to do! I hate you. Okay, this is a start. I still want the ghosts to be faster. And I want the ghosts to be not so aligned. I'm singing about batteries. Do yourself. Shoot yourself. Are you game boy for three hours? Hello, Game David. Yes, but we can't really see the ghosts. Okay, we're getting there. You're right, you can't really see the ghosts. That's why I will fix that right now. Wait, this does not work right. Actually, it should work here. Yeah, I think my original vision for this animation was already pretty good. We just needed to get all the parameters right. So, my engine does have a function to offset the camera focus when the speaker of a dialogue has a big hitbox. So I was trying to see if I could just give this a hitbox that doesn't actually exist in-game to offset the thing. Yeah! Now you can see it. Spill the energy so we can see the ghosts. You can't see the ghosts. I like the speed of animation. Yep. And it's still going to grow. We'll probably end up with like 10, 11, 12 thousand I think. Maybe 11 thousand actually. I think that's realistic. Okay, last question. Where the hell are my ghosts? There were supposed to be ghosts. Don't forget to spend their spin. Okay. Game crashes as soon as the ghosts appear. Oh no, it's the Pandora's Box code that crashed. Okay, I see why. Okay. Edged vertex magic, this color thing. Where's the terrain? The ghosts are streaming out. That might blow flickers. I'm not sure what that means. Oh, you mean... Oh, I see. Vertex colors. Yes, very possible. But not something we would implement into this model right now. Okay, my back is still not working yet. Why do the booblers not show up? We're not able to clean this water, that's why. That's exactly why. Alright, let's see if they work one last time. He did not rework the jungle level. He's been too busy with other things recently. It's been a real shame. Alright, they are showing up as intended. Alright, and now you can collect the star here. Alright, that's one of the more difficult stars, but it's doable. And I fixed the movement of Yoshi. Now he needs at least 15 more years of experience before he can fix the movement of Yoshi. And that's done in our to-do list. Ah, that gets a plus. Alright, that finishes everything in the first part of the overworld. Although this was technically part of the next part of the overworld. But yeah, it's done. We're all done. There's nothing more we have to program in the first third tier. Or just in the case. We are not doing small model details like that. We're only focusing on gameplay actors right now. I wonder if you can get it without ghosts. I would not be surprised if you could. I don't know how, but I'm sure it's possible somehow. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm trying it. I'm not doing a bye-bye just yet. We're starting work on the next thing. Hello void planet. Okay, it is very possible to get this without the ghosts. You know what, I'm fine with it. If you can't do this, fine, you get to start without the ghosts. How much percent is the game right now? I don't know. Okay, so the first four parts of the overworld are completely finished. It's actually crazy to just say, yeah, four parts of the overworld are finished. We still need 12 more. I'm going to put you into the Mario 64 PC, but let's see how you do like that. All right, so this is the first overworld, which is... Wait, where's the warp? Wait, where's the warp? I know exactly what happened. I know exactly what happened. Oh my god, I'm so glad I already know the solution. This would be such an annoying bug to debug if I didn't already know the solution. The warp was there, but it was higher than the air. Oh, this is definitely a hard world to get lost in. Dory? May I go to the other side? Okay, it looks like Dory can get stuck. That is bad. Because Dory has to take you over to the next part. Let's add some debug into Dory. He's not shamed, right? Anyway, the next part of the overworld will be right after here. You go deeper into the jungle, you find the Yoshi Dojo. And from here you actually have a lot of places to explore. I'm actually worried that this is too much to just go to right away. Because you can do all this right away. I can't go up there yet, but it's good. This is the next Bowser chip. The Achievements Dojo? No. This is the Long Jump Yoshi. This is Koopa W- Actually, it's not that much to explore. Now that I think about it, it's just three parts, right? Three parts and two new levels. And this is how you get to Pandora's Box, by the way. In case you didn't know. There's a secret path here somewhere. If even I can't find the secret path, that's maybe too deep. Where the hell is it? Oh, it's right here. Hey, here we are, Pandora's Box. So, before this, you would just see the star up there and not know what to do. It's so interesting visually. It's like, not even in the finished version. It's just me flipping through my luck quick and dirty. That was a joke, bro. Okay. I don't see any immediate issues with this, now that we have revisited this after so long. Honestly, this is kind of perfect. Yeah, you think maybe there should be fucking content in the hub worlds, like in the first three? No way. You don't think it should all just be empty with nothing in it? Oh, we also need to do the inside of the dojo still. Is there going to be a side level? I'm a bit worried about this stretch here of land, that it's going to be annoying. The industrial area is for Koopa Park. Thousands of hours? I mean, thousands of hours isn't really that much, right? In the grand scheme of things, that's like a week. We're probably putting a Yoshi village here. Maybe we can figure out why Dory bugged out. She seems to bug out every time now. That's actually great. That makes my life very easy. I might put shadows like that in, yes. Your level has definitely been coming for a long while. Action one. Oh, now she listens to me. She's definitely stuck there. Well, maybe we can look anyway. I mean, this is just a simple code. How could there be a bug? I don't know. I don't know. Can it be that this goes over 255 and that breaks it somehow? I don't think so, but I don't know. Let's just change it to this. It shouldn't make a difference. We're overwriting one of the pointers. One E. Nope. Yeah, I'm not too worried about performance in your level. Wait, Marty, I'm going to show you something cool. Once you see this, you will never be worried about visual performance issues again. Look at the coin. I'm reserving this coin for super special Easter egg areas. Currently, I have two places in mind in the game. If you want to have a super special Easter egg in your level, something that like nine out of 10 players playing the game will never find, we can put one there. This is actually the coin from Mario Odyssey. I just remade the shader on the CPU. You guys look at the coin while I look at the bug. How about that? Anything about Easter eggs? That's good. It's a bit oily. It has to be shiny. Nice, nice. It has to be really hidden though. I will not accept something that's not super hidden. Actually, the brackets don't make a difference. Yeah, I think she can buy in the game, bro. It is useful, bro. Don't worry, bro. Why is Dory not turning the way she's supposed to? That's a problem. Maybe the dist was too big and she got stuck against the wall. I have never had a fond around. Why is it just generating the same position over and over? Wait, this could be a Project 64 bug. I think it is a Project 64 bug. Because Project 64 is not capable of running my random function correctly. Nevermind. Sorry, Project 64. It doesn't emulate the count register correctly. So, the lower bits of my random function are just garbage. Interesting. Interesting. He just went offscreen and out of bounds. I crashed the game. Let's check if it is the 40. Oh, I just squared the distance. Okay, nevermind. I was wrong about my analysis. Okay, let's check if it is the 40. You're probably not surprised, but I do not have a Windows XP machine. That is a deranged thought you have. Oh, wait. Okay, so if the goal is behind her, she automatically just turns around to nowhere because of the speed multiplier. And this was probably meant to be for this. Okay, I believe we have it now. So does she have evil eyes? Uh, well, we have not dated the eyes yet to actually be context-sensitive. Okay, nice. Now she does what we want. Hey, she works! Perfect. Okay, uh, I think that's good for today. Next time we are going to finally start working on the second part of the overworld, I think. So that will be something, we're gonna have to make a lot of Yoshis up. But yeah, I'll see you guys next stream, so bye bye! Bye!
