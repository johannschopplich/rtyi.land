All right hello hello who's here where the gang at hello Valzebrum that's a fucking weird letter I guess you know I love you but I'm trying to prove someone wrong on the internet right now oh shit oh you're trying to prove wrong oh you need any help I mean I guess so I have made some changes since last time only up 64 was really really useful playtest data and I'm gonna use the playtest data to prove RTYI we should make like one or two more hacks on the RTYI engine before RTYI is released just to like get everything a little bit improved let me get some point I can help you with some models since I'm a little more confident in my skills now yeah what transparent stars later don't send a star select what's wrong with them yeah of course I want to fix the crashes but the major thing I was talking into right now was like the physics and some of the camera stuff that's just memory leak yeah so which one do you want to animate this time all right well we need animations for him sitting there and then one for him falling on down yeah I didn't you post a clip of the Goomba just peacefully eating his lunch yep that was today what's leaking memory too many condition triangles so I reduced the outer rotate force and I changed a lot of the physics and I think they're working a lot better now let me just make sure I have everything I can imagine elephant Mario I don't test on in 64 that often really I only test on it when I make like performance changes oh I just remembered I didn't finish the penguin I was finishing his idol because I wanted to have a little flappy movements in there yeah yeah that's your first task for the day then so I changed ceiling interactions so now you just wonk if you dive into a ceiling here which I think is good unless you go in the same direction as the ceiling itself and there's no longer a way to get like another ceiling which is also very very helpful we're doing that sound I'm just gliding so bad this what are we talking about I've also had some people say that the input like in this game is more than in vanilla more 64 which is crazy because it should be less oh the warps yeah yeah the warps are definitely not right no no no I'm gonna completely change the warps so what I'm gonna do is that let's let's just enter warp here so right now what happens when you enter warp is like it just does that which I don't like so instead what's it's gonna be is that the inputs are just gonna be held maybe I'm gonna make it so that Mario is holding the stick towards the warp and Mario's normal action are just gonna continue while the warp is happening so it won't look weird at all because of 60fps wait what I don't get it the input lag no no no the 60fps significantly reduces the input lag they were having the input lag on n64 at 30fps only they might have also just played at 60fps first and then gone to 30 down and then felt like there was more input lag but I mean obviously there's gonna be more with lower frame rate yeah it might have just been like a perception thing and not a real thing that is my idea as well all right any OST wishes for today having someone modding a game as background noise as I am also modding a game with peak irony I mean it sounds cozy oh you want me to only run Mario at 60fps no that wouldn't affect input lag the input lag is from the frame buffer you know being there from the triple buffer MGS OST Metal Gear Solid all right guys now that I'm living in Canada and I'm rich and all I wanna get some Yu-Gi-Oh cards anyone know where to get them for like they're cheap so I'm not paying for that shit somewhere where the shipping isn't as much as the item itself yeah like I think this is just a Canadian specific thing but shipping to Canada is almost as expensive as just buying the damn thing itself yeah can we improve response to input though well yes but I would also have to rewrite all of Mars physics to be in 60fps not really a very reasonable thing to do where's the menu that lets me select texture here but what the fuck that is weird dude it's so hard to see what's going on here I wish there was a way to turn this off oh that definitely helped a little I do not like the feet no legs yeah but he's so many polygons he's 671 so reasonable just a lot of work yeah I mean I'd also have to I don't know you'd have to run the collision twice as well it could feel pretty nice dude I hate this made the feet simpler and kept the legs you know what that's actually a pretty reasonable idea although that would make them to cycle but this is like a whole texture just for the feet you know what fuck it no it's vertex off of these is zany Z find a friend of mine model a jacket with putting out like 700 or something yeah I mean it's very easy to inflate the balling on you can just model very inefficiently and you're gonna get a lot of polygons there was a weird time in Mars 64 hacking where people were proud of how many polygons the level set because they were like oh look my love was for detail there's 50,000 polygons and then you'd be like well yeah but you could make it look the exact same with like 10,000 why are you talking about that like that's an achievement that's like people who buy expensive clothing when did happen in my sister community probably like 2014 2013 maybe even 2015 dude bragging about how much the stuff you have costs is so funny to me it's like okay all you did was prove that you just managed to get a bad deal you shouldn't be proud of I'm not using RGBA 32 later that's it's actually maybe let me let me take a look here maybe they could work as RGBA 32 oh but mm-hmm yeah it can still be layer 4 dude the gigantic level thing is so bad there's so many people that just made levels no we can't really hmm we could but I think I prefer this what language do you speak how hard were they to learn I speak German which was very easy to learn because I was born in it I speak English which was very easy to learn because English is a very simple language and I can read a little bit of Latin because I was forced to learn it in school and that one's obviously a lot more difficult no I get the idea leader okay we could try it but like I would have to remake the texture yeah thank you for the donation as well that was a lot of delay you don't think English is a simple language I don't know English like it doesn't have a lot of cases it there's like barely any there's no gen bus it's so similar to a lot of languages why do you hate English oh yeah we need a new wiggler face texture to this one has the rosy cheeks this one looks pretty good to me let's get his face oh also his nose is different and it looks like that maybe a bit darker I would not survive a Portuguese grammar lesson I'm sure I would can it be worse than German grammar can it be worse than Latin grammar Latin grammar is that's where it's at I'm still surprised that like the Romans were even able to speak their own language it's honestly surprising fingers 9 or 10 verb tenses that doesn't sound like that many how many are there in oops wait this is already this is already at scale that's perfect minty thank you for the $10 give up the good work on your ex you deserve it thank you very much I will do my best we're slowly going creeping towards completion on this one here hello biobank sup so funny thing happened I accidentally deleted the entire on me up 64 repository so now we can't work on that game anymore I like how do you kill him you don't you just give him a fucking aneurysm how okay so he's the overseer and there's like all these guys working on the oil rig and you just fuck with everyone and he gets so upset that he just loses it physics feels so nice I am glad to hear that because I have heard a lot of people say they hate them the reception of the current rtyi engine is very mixed I find some people say they love it others say they hate it What if his body turned red with each guy you kill so you have vision you cannot yes yes yes look I even I even have to control for that setup already today there's definitely a rose tinting with vanilla Mario 64 collision a lot of people were looking at some of the bugs in RTY or not the bugs some of the oddities in the collision in RTY and it was just like yeah this is a vanilla thing that's just how Mario 64 works bro like one thing very specifically is slope jumps a lot of people got upset at the slope jumps but like it's just Mario 64 for you this guy is not a boss fight okay I'll explain to you guys again so we are all on the same page here and if there's anything you don't like about it let me know so we have this oil rig here and the wiggler is gonna be right here he's the overseer and he's gonna say some stuff like at first he says oh works going well my guys are doing this and that and that and that and then you go and you like go to the Koopas and you fucking break their heart and there's a little bit of a cutscene of the wiggler doing like an angry animation and going slightly red maybe with some puff coming out and if you talk to him now he's like yeah work is maybe not going that great but we still have this going on and that going on and that going on and so you go to the next guy and you like fucking ruin his day and the wiggler gets more red and so on and so on until eventually you messed with all four people if you ever seen broken glass in your life what's wrong with mine so after you mess with everyone the wiggler just says okay I've had enough of this shit we're not getting anything done and he just kind of has like a cutscene where he runs along here and here and then he just disappears the angry Koopa the cement is my favorite yeah the angry Koopa is super fun witness with super steep slopes again that's a vanilla Mario 64 thing look at the slope here if you jump into this Mario's gonna be rejected but if you dive he's not or if you like dive at the ground point he gets also sliding on it that's just Mario 64 this is just not how glass breaks or this is just now how glass breaks like this is it now we accept that not this is not acceptable what's wrong with it what do you want me to do if you consider making it so that instead of super steep slopes knocking you back you can walk a couple of them I'm pretty sure newer games do that you can do that but there has to be a threshold where wall ends and like a slope starts and what I think I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make it so Mario lands on it like a normal slope you have any way to tell how much of the cement is ruined yes no actually do you want to make me cry actually I could tell how much of the cement is ruined and that sounds like a funny stack yeah that's it doesn't fucking split into all right my bike I'm adding you a sec fuck it shouldn't be too hard to do I say that but we all know this is gonna be the whole stream now oh yeah guys you're gonna like this I took notes from how we work in years for breakfast and I decided I will make all the magic numbers into defines in this file and I even added comic comments that follow some sort of code guidelines so now we have all the defines for like Mars physics and the camera even and they're super easy to modify I changed a lot of code readable unbelievable well this isn't really the cause right how are you gonna do this yes all right all right here we go all right so whenever you add a bad print we will update the done percentage and if it's Mario whiteness yes Mario whiteness how would you call it how does it feel singing anything the most powerful s64 was that what about us that's a good argument actually like I think I'm very good at what I'm doing but there are definitely people out there that know more about how to fuck with the n64 than me I just happen to be very good like Mario 64 and that optimization I think I'm the best optimization guy but just general and 64 nope that ain't me all right 3 4 2 minus 2 5 6 8 6 you lost all your progress that's why I keep telling you to swim control this can I optimize your pizza consumption speed I could help you train your pizza consumption speed I could yes I like the text I'm just gonna take this exact text and copy paste it in here Cooper is building as some men's glass Cooper one and two and Cooper after devastating cement this is so funny eight nine actually I ruined the text somehow there we go no way yes so calculating the exact percentage it's not a good idea but we can kind of approximate it hello Arthur yeah I'm streaming on YouTube now I switched off twitch twitch is just so many ads that I just don't like it anymore I don't enjoy watching strip twitch streams anymore so I decided it is time to leave so it's a can I find the size of this somehow you know what I don't need to find the size of this there's actually a few people still sub to my twitch I'm still getting twitch paychecks despite not streaming on there and I hope those people never forget to unsub I stream on this channel not your main so I can actually read the text I kind of want to filter this chat to only be the people that actually care about the project I don't want just a thousand randoms coming in here and talking about random stuff like I just want to actually just work on my hack define array count invalid application of size of yeah I don't think I can get the size of this year I don't think there's anything in my repo that tells me the size of this thing which sucks great I think it's 256 by 128 divided by two bytes so I think I think 95% is a bit high especially because getting the pixels to be exactly zero value is pretty difficult so I'm gonna set it to 45% but it's not work no well no we can't get the size of the thing at all now if you want to know the size of a thing you can't just define it as an error like this unfortunately you may be it's if it's in the same file but definitely not for the next turn yeah yeah okay we're on the same page while emulating Star Trek 64 is a ten times more expensive than playing it on an N64 okay so one six three eight I don't want to iterate 16,384 elements here how about to approximate this we just take 16 pixels every that wouldn't work either I need something that randomly picks a few pixels on the screen that they should always be the same ones and I don't want this to just be like every few pixels and it should also be everything like it should always be 16 pixels in a row because if it's not then we're wasting the cache SSS here I'm not using some fucking hash algorithm I just need to find like a good number to increment this with I don't think 32 is good I think we should make like a few squares on this compare the changes you did to each pixel and add it to the value that would be cache optimal and fast and stuff yes but it would require editing this code no thank you this is run so rarely it doesn't really matter you what do you think of occasions better than 2ds no way dude a vacation that vacation is temporary a 2ds you have so much fun with it forever and besides why would you want to go on a vacation if you don't have a 2ds but what do you even do on your vacation okay I think what we're gonna do you know take 16 pixels and then we're gonna move maybe diagonally maybe like a bit far diagonally so ink less than one six one six three eight four ink plus equals 128 this is single line um so like 160 maybe  mm-hmm well this worked fine it's gonna be here and then here and then it's gonna take four to get across the whole thing that's not good maybe 144 is better maybe 176 trust me this makes sense that's not how i spell dirtiness the first time is it all right let's take a look at it it's about 93 times yep that's on purpose i don't want to actually iterate all 16 384 texture particles i want to just iterate a few random ones everywhere so that it feels like you have to dirty them all you see that you see how it decreases the value no matter where i go just because i picked a few random ones why did i pick 176 just so it kind of goes all over the place right i have like horizontal lines so if i had picked 128 with this being an i4 and the being 256 then all that would have that would be like the line at the back here but because i added 44 to n not 44 because i added 48 to that it's like picking this tile and then like one here and then one here and then one here right it's kind of like picking diagonals that are everywhere and as you can see no matter where i go it always seems to decrease the value which is exactly what i wanted right now i'm just thinking of what would be a good threshold value here it doesn't make a good solution okay what's your solution Doesn't this look perfect? Like we just cut computation costs into like not even fucking, like basically a 15th. Yeah I might have to change the alpha on this. Change the color. Yeah I can do that, yeah. Honestly I just had it so dark so that it would be easier to debug. Okay what would be a good threshold though? I think this should only happen if you do this a lot. So if dirt less than... Right now it's like 200,000. It started like 38,000. Eh, 380,000. So 95% is maybe a bit much, but I'm gonna put like 40,000. Fucked up Yoshi of the week while you think about this. Alright let's see the fucked up Yoshi of the week. How fucked up is he? That's not fucked up, that's nice. I like this one. Look Zeyna, it's the Yoshi hand warmer. That's adorable. Keep your hands warm. Let's verify this code works once just because I want to remove the debug code. Just modify the drawing code please, I'm begging you. It works perfectly fine though, like what's wrong with this? This takes a minute to make dirty.  So good how you put your hands in this gap to warm and hold them. Increase the dirt area on Mario. I mean it's done via textures, but I quit, yeah. Or we could just reduce the threshold because this is taking a while to do. Although it is an easter egg, so I mean, if you want the easter eggs you can work hard for them. I feel like a lot of people are gonna just get the easter egg though just because this is so fun to do. All right, only 50,000 points of dirt missing. Oh, that's a good idea. You should have a sobbing animation for this. Did you hear the plans Zeyna? What? So basically you ruin his by just like taking a few steps in it, right? But if you like basically make almost the entire area black, he's just gonna start crying and he's gonna have a new text. So you should give him a sobbing animation for that. Can you do that real quick? I can try, yeah. Wait, I should send you the updated Koopa. The updated Koopa. Yeah, I might have changed it. Wait, can I give him a stomping tantrum? Well, I mean, the easter egg is that he's saying, do you want to make me cry? Ah, I see. All right. And we're gonna make him cry. Reduce the threshold a little. I was thinking, like, you mean make it even harder or make it less hard? I think 40,000 is a pretty good value here. Okay, let's make this builder Koopa cry. Less hard. I mean, biomech, let's say 95%. Yeah, make sure you auto-renumerate stuff, please. I think Arthur is trying to become a mod. Are we gonna mod Arthur? Is that gonna be a thing? Okay, I get it, stop. It's completely ruined now. Do you want to make me cry? Is this what you want? All right, that works perfectly. Okay, that didn't take one and a half hours, isn't that neat? Back to this guy. I don't like his face. Sanjay, I'm trying to know if people are going to do it, so being very high is fine as long as there's no way you can miss it if you do it correctly. Yeah. He doesn't interrupt you and you have to talk to him, but if his animation changes, I think people are gonna notice. Straight out of a YouTube prank thumbnail, kinda, yeah? Took his face from here. Maybe I should just take his face from R64DS. He looks like he has no brain cells. I'm just gonna take the R64DS one. I think he should interrupt you. He can, yeah. I don't know, we'll see. Let's get the animation first. Oh, what the fuck happened to my buttons? Why did they change color? I am afraid. Oh my god, he has so many triangles. That is way too much. Why does a R64DS model have so many triangles? Maybe the color palette? Hello, Cac Honka Honka. We find a tiny kitten, a traffic cone for a... What a wild idea. Okay. Let's see if we can make this good. The R64 polys, so they made Wiggler using default icospheres. That would check out, yeah. What happened to the Wiggler model? We deleted everything and started. Check this out. I sent you a thing. I'm gonna take a look. I think it should be the first animation that opens up. I'm taking information from Magic Wand for Wiggler's dialogue. Magic Wand doesn't have a Wiggler. This one, Build a Koopa 2? Yes. And he cried. Is this... Wait, what? Does this loop? I mean, the crying should loop. Wait, what the fuck happened? What did you do? I just made him cyclic. It's probably because this animation frame is missing. Wait, what? Yeah, some stuff about this is not going right. And the crying should loop. But what the fuck is going on? Here, I'm just gonna get rid of the stomp and I'll just have him cry. What do you mean? We don't have a Wiggler Yelladeela. There's nothing to keep consistent with. I'd love to just use a model I already have, but I don't. Yeah, we have the young Wiggler, but how's that gonna help us here? I tried to use that model, it just looks bad. For the big Wiggler. You realized something? What is the something you realized? Fine, you're allowed to make new models. It still has 180 triangles, it's just so much too much. Decimate modifier, mhm. I am going to decimate your family tree. Alright, I got rid of the stomp, I just have a looping cry. Alright. I don't want it to look too similar to the end of the normal stomp though. Like, what's this normal animation end like? Because if it looks the same, it's not gonna work. I don't know.     Straight from the 40s, damn. Isn't this normal angry animation already very similar to what you made? Well, he just shakes his head after he stomps. Yeah, so it's almost the same, isn't it? Well, he just holds his hand in and just shakes his head, that's it. Is this one here? Yeah, that's the angry stomp. Yeah. And then he just holds his head and cries. Maybe he should just sit down on his butt and be like... Alright, I can do that. Enter the Amplitude Insiders program. Get to play these games early for free. You're not paid for that. You should get paid to play these games. I'm not adding motors. Motors weren't even good enough for Mario 64. What makes you think I want them in my game? Motors only belong on one place and that is a better hex. You're only saying that because you got so much clout out of motors. Motors isn't beta. I think if you make videos about motors, you are a beta romhack creator. Arthur got his clout off of beta. There, I said it. Motors isn't raw, it's dark, blah, blah, blah. That doesn't stop me. Oh, the color of these is so different. That's weird. Like the color of the head in the segments are so different here. But that was already an issue before. That looks so dumb. Okay, I think this works. I just want to change the color of the segments. I tried, but I still haven't. What's the proper pronunciation? I don't know. I just started like an hour ago. I used to stream on Twitch. But I think Twitch has gotten so bad recently that I just don't want to stream on it anymore. Yeah. Twitch has gone too many ads. Twitch has gone ad crazy. It's like, unusable. I even get ads when I'm subscribed to people. That shouldn't be happening. Okay. I Think this looks pretty similar Did you see what they found on the mar 64 this girl's good yeah do it I saw it that's crazy, isn't that I According to me my name is pronounced however, it's on school at the moment in the sentence that you're saying I like that Bob almost pronounced. Oh, it sounds good. I want to bet you don't get to make that decision. That is up to shiggy-miggy 693 triangles it's a bit much, but I think this is fine A lot of rock my do it. Yeah when I saw the rock my instantly like did a flip I Should wear a vest like a service dog that could also kind of work, but how are you gonna make him wear a vest? I Think I'm gonna do it like this just so it's easier to animate I You've been rubbing mad This is so dumb Oh This one is the wrong parent There we go You could just make a circle highlights a yellow something wrong with this Your CD is broken khaki that's unlucky fuck you put the bones in your I think slate it's yeah, that's a good point. I did just put bones in a worm All right, let's check out his new crying animation Oh Oh Nathaniel Bandy's editor just wrote me. He said he's rendering every right now. All right, it's gonna be good All right, I hope this renders this time Yeah, that works There's a separate animation for the build-up to the sit-down and then this can just loop Like this just loops from here or is there anything else here? There's one action where he just sits and then this is the action where he cries Without maybe that would be well, but is this one supposed to go? Yeah, that one's supposed to loop the crying And what's the other one what about to see other animation do it's just But this is in the same animation, yeah, so I'll just use this Y'all frost out. Thank you for the $10 donation. Dude. This is the first day. I'm actually getting like real super chat donations on YouTube Is it good? Yes, I like it And we're getting so many right away that is actually amazing Oh We need to know OST Any wishes what's up with walk? Don't use that's an old animation and blender has this weird thing of getting rid of animations The file. Yeah Like it just fucks up the entire file and blender has hasn't fixed it yet zero one two, three, four five I Just need some man said crying solving sound the fact copyright free true put his hands down covering its eyes Their hands are not long enough for the head. No, there's not enough bones for that. And this is too low-poly of a model for it to be Perfect. This is as good as it's gonna get My zero Hello And That's a long elevator OST What is this It's just 20 seconds. Oh You guys don't know the OST for this level yet. I can't show you I Can't show you but dupe shouldn't mean it's just recently Yeah, I don't think so Oh wait, I did hear this you heard version one Oh, yeah Yeah, this is better than the first version Dude this is melee. You hear that? That was the melee menu. I Think he did use the menu sound yes What the fuck was that I Yeah, the both assembles and it's already good What do the glass Cooper's do cry they cry us They're carrying glass around for the workstation here, certainly nothing bad will happen to them He the fact over the intense can surely possible but not a good idea What did I say animation 5 1 2 3 4 5. Yes. The problem with doing that is that it'd be like It would be Very like introducing on emulator, I think and maybe even on console Some mechanical sounds are really feel integrated. Yeah. Yeah, that was a song and like shining stars one that had like mechanical sounds Those could really work Okay, no one suggested an OST. We're now listening to songs that make you dance No, wait Nintendo songs There we go I Can't play the happy song on loop because that will get me striked I Let's see if he does this animation and text Shit, I also need to make it so that the feed us the animation loops properly. Let me do that real quick I Like circle Welcome to the stream So I didn't write you should like instantly start crying All right, the text was slightly cut off Yes He's like this now He's just so done You should still oh, no, he doesn't know much anymore. All right, I think it works fine He's not paid enough to deal with our nonsense Turn this back down Depression Koopa Well, the depression version of that is an easter egg. You have to really try to mess with him to have that happen Oh To fucking sucks dude and Every optimization video I make I get one guy going. Hey case I've seen this YouTube video by like some random youtuber and he said if you turn on no tool It's gonna improve the game. You should try that It's like oh Really? So you think some random fucking youtuber? Just randomly happens to know a thing about optimizing Mario 64 that I don't Why are they slanted You could have just copy pasted the spine ones could you not No, then the parents isn't that set up correctly Don't show cases on a channel. I don't think that all people will even watch my channel or might even forget by the time I release Why don't you just push to make the game run good button true Pine and coke and I both know a lot about Mario 64, but we have different knowledge sets Maybe How do you set the name of multiple things rename batch rename Suffix There just taught you a new blender trick I Need to one of the fast 64 scripts You Shoutouts to cozy's from writing this one cool All right, we got all our bones set up 13 bones for this guy, I think that's fine Yes Yes, I have a blender plug-in here it's gone fast 64 it gives you all these options here and it can export everything directly from the ROM Even like objects placed right and we said we wanted to reduce the transparency of this Let me do that real quick Maybe the shade color is just too dark Let Me see what I did for the transparency one multiple primitive color minus texture 0 alpha All right, let's try to cement it like this should make it look a lot better Reuse the robot mirror breaking engine for the glass. Yeah, dude. I wonder what about that one I can't believe Robert wrote a whole mirror breaking engine just for a sec So now it's so good at programming and wrote the whole mirror breaking engine Hmm This isn't looking very good either can barely see the footsteps now and it's too bright Recently and got to the level that's energy way and what the fuck it's insanely hard compared to the rest of the game you gave Up, I had no idea That's harsh Enter the pipe, please I wish you could still see some of the cement detail in here Yeah, I really gotta turn the alpha down maybe I Think the reason it was so hard to see it before was just that it's too bright. Let's try this How do I feel about combustible versus flammable? I don't know what the difference between the two words is but flammable Sounds a lot more self-explanatory word wise. So I think I prefer flammable When I refuse to acknowledge some input solution because we already went over that when we first made the butt prints Okay, that looks really good now oh I like this a lot That is so much better Burniness actually do it burniness Now I feel like, I feel like a word for that already exists. It's like the amount of energy you need to start an exothermic reaction, right? That's what I would call it. Burn rate, no, no, burn rate is something completely different. That is the rate at which it burns, alright? That's how much material you can destroy in how much time. How do you know this won't lag on N64? I just know, brah. Just guess, honestly. We also tested a little bit around earlier and it mostly worked fine if we turn on backface scaling on DCR, which sucks at all, but on N64 that looks better anyway, because otherwise there's so much visual noise. That I'm up for that and I'm down for that mean the same thing despite the association being literal antonyms? Shit. That's, that is fucked up. How come it's calmed down but shut up? I mean those are the opposites in how polite they are, well actually no, calmed down isn't a very polite either. Dude it's a Dr. Mario song, I just realized. I am Dr. Mario, I can cool tricks. I am Dr. Mario, I can all... Contronym. That's not a Lickma, is it? You wouldn't come to my chat right here and Lickma my viewers, would you? It's gonna be on the floor anyway, so it doesn't matter. You would? Oh shit, what a menace. Why is the nose painted? What the fuck? Okay, we're gonna reset the vertex groups, clearly there was some residual data in here. Yep, yep, yep. There is a lot of these. I don't like Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart Wii is my favorite Mario Kart game. I think Mario Kart Wii is the best Mario Kart game to date for a simple reason. It has the only good online mode out of all the Mario Karts. Yes, it sucks that Funky Kong is so OP, but like, also, also, it's the only Mario Kart game where you have shit to do while you drive. In most games you just play for like 5 seconds and then you wait 10 seconds just holding the A button. In Mario Kart Wii, you can at least do wheelies. Is it the only Mario Kart game that looks like the camera lens is turning? Yeah, fine. I was not being a gamer on this one. The problem with the other Mario Kart online modes is that like Mario Kart 8, you can't lose points. There's no tension to it. You can be completely brain dead and get like infinite points. This is level 11. And no, it's not a Mecha Wiggler. This is the Overseer. Do I 1-Eat? 2-Don't Eat? Out of the options presented to me, Eat sounds like the best one. Yeah, it's kind of hard to motivate yourself to try if like no matter whether you try or not, you're going to win anyway. And that's why I like Mario Kart Wii. Mario Kart Double Dash is also great. Dude, when Mario Kart Double Dash came out, I was a little kid. I was so bad at Mario Kart that I couldn't really beat it. So what I did is I played this together with a friend and we didn't play in the same kart. We played in two different karts and I would just get like last place and form blue shells so you could always get first and we beat the game like that. Mario Kart Wii is my favorite game. Oh my god. We'll crack the bloom and then it will really look next-gen. Do you guys think that maybe Mario Kart Double Dash is going to be at F3? Wouldn't that be cool? There's a lot of graphic effects that are really nice. But see when you're making a game with graphic effects and you have this graphic effect there, it's really tempting to put this graphic effect and there's so much that you're sure that the player will notice it just because like you want players to notice it. But usually if you're making it so much that players notice it, it's like overdone. That's the issue. Yep, it's very easy to overdo graphic effects just because it's so tempting. This sounds like the cooking song from Paper Mario. All right, let's see if our wiggler looks fine. No, actually by being bad at Mario 64, you have better chances of making a good attack. Because if you're good at Mario 64, there's going to be many random things in your game that you won't notice that casual players will have huge problems with. Let's see if I can find examples. Let's see what in here would be easy for me that a casual player might have trouble with. Okay, maybe nothing in this level, but in many levels there will be a lot of stuff. Shit, I messed up on the prim color. And he's on the floor. And his nose is big. But yeah, for example slopes is a huge thing. When you make a romhack and you like experience with Mario 64 and there's a slope, you will just platform around the slope because you know the slope will make you slide. But like as a loop, you will run on the surface and be like, oh shit, this sucks. Oh, I didn't set this right. Although there's also a lot of value in just making hacks for super experienced players anyway. Because a lot of the romhack players are super experienced. So if you make your hacks in a way that only super experienced players enjoy it, you will still get almost entirely positive reviews. Exactly. You have to know your target audience. That's always the key. Only app 64 has a lot of awkward slopes on purpose. That's like what the entire game is about. It is a rage game. Which last impact secrets some guy? Dude, this wiggler looks like he just came home from war or something. What is with the normals? Have you been on Niantic as of late with streaming? It's been like three months since last upload to K-Spots. I usually watch them while I work. No, I steam on HearthStorms. The streams are all like, you can watch them back to back now. You have three months of streams built up. No, no, no. All the streams are stored in case clips. I have nothing to do with SM64 EX. I will never touch that shit. Why would I? If I wanted my game to work on PC exclusively, I would make it an Unreal Engine. I don't know. All right. He's a big boy. Now the thing is, how do we make him look? What's his animation gonna be? He's large and in charge. Yup. Most of the community is actually on PC. But if you make it N64 compatible, that's like bonus points. There's a few people that refuse to play on anything other than an N64. But that's also way harder to make it work on N64 than an emulator. Sinewave movement of his balls. Well, he's an overseer, so he shouldn't be walking around too much. And we also have the issue that I somehow have to make all his hitboxes work fine. Hello, me. That's GTM's profile picture. Oh, N64 vs PC port mod. No one is taking the PC port serious. No real person. The thing about the PC port is that the graphics emulator they have built into that doesn't actually emulate the graphics very well. At least, that was my last cent. So if you look at this, the water here wouldn't render. The... what else wouldn't render? Probably Bowser wouldn't render. That whole thing wouldn't render. The whole dart effect here wouldn't work. It only simulates the graphics instead of emulating it. What is the difference? Why? Because your PC doesn't have an RDP built in? Okay. Let me think about this. Does he maybe need a booth or something to just stand in? I feel like him just needing a booth. Just being around would feel weird. Well, it's a port. The code runs natively. But how are you going to make the graphics run natively? Maybe he's got a little pencil beside his hat. One of those thick worker pencils that clip for you. But why is he carrying that? I'm not sure if that's a question I want to have the player put into his mind. Guys, if you want a proper PC port, just port Mario to Unreal Engine. It's really not that difficult. I'm not sure if that's a question I want to have the player put into his mind. I was thinking I should just do that for April 1st. Just to fuck with everyone. I'll just port Mario to Unreal Engine. Stand half his balls up? What does that mean? Stand half his balls up? He would be like a crawly worm doing a handstand? You want two of them to be on a podium? Interesting.  Let me see. How do the overseers usually look like? Construction manager. What the fuck am I looking at? When your helmet tells you a funny joke. All of these people look so stupid. What is this? Okay, so he is planning here. I see. So he should maybe have some kind of desk that he's working on. So having him have a booth kind of works. It would also be fun if he had like four seats. But how do you make it? How do you make him look like he's sitting down? I can make him stand up like in Mario Tennis. Like that. Is this what Biobank meant? He even has arms here. Maybe he should have arms. Did he have this on N64? It was on the N64 game. Not Wiggler. But Alex, Harry, Nina and Kate were in here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh my god, I missed like 500 messages. What? I thought my chat froze. Google Wiggler standing up, first image result. Oh, oh. Yes, exactly that. Okay, my chat just froze. O-Fast is also worse than O2 on Mario 64, I think. Maybe, I don't know actually. Okay, so if we have him standing up here, let's say we do. No, mom, I'm not ignoring you, my chat just froze. I tell that to my mom at the dinner table. No, I like the Mario Tennis one. But should he just be standing up like that and looking around, like way, way? The thing is, if he's standing up like that, I think he needs arms. He's wearing heavy boots, Leela. I have no idea what Skippity Toilet is. I saw that in Fortnite once and I was very confused. They look more like boots. How? We have no triangles to work with. Hide this jacket. Yes. I mean, we could have that over all his balls, yeah, but would that just be like a long tube? Thank you, Mr. Video Game. Would they still be individual balls? Are you thinking of just having this be a long tube? Because I don't see either one looking very good right now. Besides, he needs to wear the helmet, so it makes sense that he can't be hit. I don't want the player to try and damage him. On second thought, he doesn't actually need all the helmets, unless the hide parts, because you can't hit them anyway. But they look so cool. Hmm. If we make him stand, let's just try. Let's just try around a bit with the wreck here, see what we can do. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, this wreck's not the most practical to work with, I realize. Hmm. I think his top part should be hands, though. Till then, I need a ball instead of a hat. Yeah, these are nice, too. Although we'd have to make up a tool for each part. Hmm. Yeah, the hats are getting kind of crunched. I'm thinking maybe we should remove, like, the last two. Yeah, I think the hats can't be made to work. Hmm. Hmm. Let's see this boss again. Oh my god, he's so big. But if we change the top ones for, like, hands, I think this is great. He's floating a little bit, that's not good.  A little smaller, yeah. Maybe, like, 80% the size? Is the surface shading just playing backwards? I don't think so. The shader looks fine to me. Is Mario usually twice the vertical size of a regular segment? I don't think so. If you, like, look at Mario Sunshine, definitely not. Look at Mario 64, also not really. Okay. But I'll make him a bit smaller here.  Oh yeah, that's a good size to me. And I need to correct this again, great. I think he's still gonna be floating. The armature object? I don't trust that. Yeah, he's still floating. So I just select minus 15. Now I want the top one to be arms. Honestly, with the head's gone, we can maybe even add a little bit of detail to the legs again. I'd rather just do it like this, Leila. I don't trust that it will stay fine in the future. Okay. What does the wiggler arm usually look like? It's pretty orange, honestly. Maybe kind of like that. Okay. Not a good arm yet. Hey, case, do you know any phrases in German I can use to make a woman fall for me? Asking for a friend. Guten Morgen. I don't know. The secret that nobody found on Lost Impact? No, it's not a level. I don't even know if there's just one secret no one found on Lost Impact yet. I know there's at least one. What is it? I'm not telling you a secret no one found till now. No way. If you want to know what the secret is, you have to earn it. Most I'll do is I'll give everyone a hint. The secret no one has found so far has to do with a boss fight. Yes. Yes, I can see your comment.  No, I can't see your comment. It is invisible. Yes. All right, looks like he's on the floor now. The rideable peach is also not the E-Stack I'm talking about. That's honestly more of a bug than an E-Stack. See, the thing is, I know that bug would happen. But also, I thought if you break the game enough to get to Peach, then fine, you can ride Peach. What the fuck was that? How did I get through the wall? You subbed? Nice. Yeah, it should be in all versions. Nah, this is connected, that's not the issue. This particular woman gets mad when me... When I'm... Gets mad when me, I mean when my friend says good morning to her. Oh, shit. Try Bonjour. She might not know that one yet. Alter Ego is the worst part of Castle Dungeon. Look, you can just turn it off. And you're fine. Okay, I'll have him here. And I'll have him talk to Monro. Let me add the bone for this. These bones are not named correctly. The bones are not named at all. Why don't you name your bones? It makes my life easier. Just click on them. Did I look at the Wicklow mockup image? I did not see a Wicklow mockup image. Where is it? We have not beaten Tears of the Kingdom yet. We are still in the process of playing it. Are we gonna go for the 100% completion? No. Okay, guys. For all of you who have played Tears of the Kingdom... I have a bad opinion for you guys. I have a really bad opinion for you guys. So I like the games. But... The Shrine Raider is the fucking worst. It actively makes the game worse. It keeps telling you, hey, there's a shrine. You should go there. But then you try and go there and it's just in a fucking cave. And you can't find the entrance. And it happens all the time. No, I think that's a good opinion. I don't think it's a bad opinion. Hold on. Hello? Cold tech moment? What? He sent a link. I don't know. I don't see a link. Shit. This is not the first bone. This is actually... A terrible part. About Fast64. I don't understand how to get around. How do I make this the first bone? What is it? How do I make this the first bone so that the geo actually happens? Because... Can I just make the parent none? No, it's just a separate geo layout. And the same thing. The bones get sorted alphabetically. Okay, then why is... After bone? Tell me that. I'll just manually edit it. Show geo. I'll just show that on stream right now. Okay. Where is the AAAA bone? It's this one right here. Right after the root. And yeah, the root happens first. But how am I supposed to make this happen before the root? I don't see a way to do it. Am I supposed to parent the root? Root to the GeoASM bone? I can try that. Function bones can unhave children. The inside effect the next sibling in order, yeah, doesn't work either. There's nothing I can do to solve this. How I decrement learning ASM? Actually, I just recently did an instruction at a conference called Handmade Boston, where I explain how to reverse engineer N64 games. What was it? Oh, we are at my parents' house for dinner tomorrow. Tomorrow? At four. At four? Or five, baby. Okay. It's gonna be a busy day tomorrow. Can you like just send the link maybe? Like maybe separate the link from like a space? Yeah. American cheese is not legally a cheese. Goddamn. Americans get nothing going for them. I mean, if you're eating cheese whiz, that shit's not cheese. Cheese whiz? It's like, it's like a cheese spread. Think of Nutella, but cheese flavored. It's kind of nasty. Oh, shit. We have a Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild discussion going on. This will be one for comment engagement. Miracle Whip. Miracle Whip is disgusting. It's nasty. I agree, Biobec. Miracle Whip is the worst spread on the planet. Four Swords is really great when you have multiple people to play it with. Single player campaign's not bad, but it's definitely better when you have more than one person. Listen, I can make a really good mayonnaise, but Miracle Whip is anything but that. It's disgusting. We do have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in Canada. Let's see, do we get more angry animation-wise? There is Four Swords on the Game Boy Advance and there's Four Swords Adventure on the GameCube. I have indeed played both of them. I fucked it up because I forgot to turn off the prim color. And I fixed it. Aldi's? Aldi? I don't think we have Aldi. Aldi's nuts across your face? No, Aldi is a real thing. I'm aware, but the door was wide open for that. Oh no, Viomix, you said the same thing. There might be one in Quebec. Quebec? But I might be thinking of a different grocery store. Yeah, that's a solid C. Oh, it doesn't work because I used prim color on everything else. Wait, hold on, I'm gonna google this right quick if we have any Aldi's in Canada. But they're probably not in our province. Does this work? The only thing I'm getting is whether or not Aldi is coming to Canada. That means it's not there. Yeah. Why is threshold written like that? It should be called threshold, right? I think that would make a lot more sense. Threshold instead of fresh-old. You've seen NumenGel stuff in LibDragon? I have not. Food in France is that much better than England? I thought English food being bad was like a meme. But I did have fish and chips once and no, not fish and chips. I had breaded fish, no, baked fish. What was it called? Was that what I brought home from work? I think so. The one I brought home from work was just breaded haddock. But wasn't like, no, that never had like a special name. I think that was like the fish and chips thing. It was awful. It tasted like cardboard. The one you have that tasted like cardboard is just fish and roasties. And it's got gluten-free breadcrumbs, which already tastes like cardboard and flaxseeds. All right, well, the Wiggler is getting angry now. Maybe you should have different texture too, where it just looks very, very sad. Fish and roastie. Yeah, it's literally just a piece of breaded fish with the breadcrumbs being gluten-free with flaxseed and wedge potatoes. It's just okay. The fish is kind of bland. You didn't get silence, Devi. I just can't see your link. I don't know what's going on. Maybe just DM it to me on Discord. Mario can walk on water. Here's Jesus. Okay, I want the Wiggler to become sad though, if it's above a certain threshold. Let's find a sad texture for his face. The Pope is in Portugal? Oh my god. He DMed it to me. All right, let's see the Wiggler concept. I don't have a clue. I don't have a DM. Devi, DM to you on Twitter. Twitter? Let's see Twitter. Nope. No, you use Discord. Or maybe it's one of my message requests. Ah, there it is. This is your Wiggler concept. To just have him have a belt like that. That's a worker's vest. It kind of makes sense though. Yeah. But it would fuck up if he's standing up like that. It wouldn't work. Maybe he could have like multiple mini vests on each of his body parts. Yeah, but it's adding so many polygons to do that. I think he has to stay the way he is. Can you not make it into a texture? Maybe. It might be tricky though. Oh, like a service dog vest. I get it. Yeah, the idea of a service dog is pretty funny. I also sent you the penguin. All right, let me just. I tried my very best to get the idol. Does that look sad enough for the Wiggler? No, just give it to me. I'll do it. Fine. I have to look at the Wiggler another day. I don't think I have the time today. Oh god, that sucks. Dude, actual fun fact. Back when I was in uni, I was supposed to program in MATLAB, but I was too lazy to learn it. So I just took two like dumb people in my class and I made them like part of my group. And I just did all the math homework and they had to do the MATLAB part. I kind of did that in all my subjects or in most of them. I either did the homework alone or I got someone who just doesn't know how it works and just got to do like write down everything I say. Because I had the thing where, you know, you know how I don't comment my code? Well, I didn't really comment my math findings either. So I just like... Yeah, I just get people to write it down for me. Can this go pay for MATLAB? I don't know, but we were supposed to use it. Or it was latex. That's how the program was called, I think. So... I don't think 13 degrees Celsius is that bad. Like, of course, it's going to be a mass extinction. But doesn't that technically mean there's more energy on the planet and like more stuff can grow? No? A YouTube video saying that it's bad to comment your code, which seemed very strange to me, but then watch it so you don't actually know what they said. Okay, they probably mean that it's bad to write code in a way that comments are required and code should be self-commenting, which would be ideal. Which, I mean, obviously that's true, but that's not always possible. They probably just said that to like get the clicks. Okay, let's write this code. So... Yeah, I agree, Mayo. We can't just cut them off, unfortunately. So... Wait, why are people telling me that my DMs on Twitter are set to only verify people? Is that why you couldn't write me on Twitter? How do I change that? Settings and privacy. How can I make it so people... Dude, I wish you could monetize your tweets without Twitter Blue, because I want the money, but I don't want to pay for Twitter Blue. It's another one of Elon Musk's fantastic decisions. No! How do I make it so people can write me again? I think maybe we need to accept the fact that Twitter is just going downhill and it's probably gonna die soon. Profile settings. Dude, how do I get monetization? Not yet in Lunchable. How do I change my X settings? Security. Nope, it's not security. Delegate? Nope. Privacy and safety. Direct messages. Messages from everyone. There we go. Filter low quality messages. All right, well, I fixed that. Why are you thinking that I'm not? I'm paying for Twitter Blue. Actually, though, there's this thought in my mind that if I paid for Twitter Blue, I could get more ad revenue from Twitter than I would pay for Twitter Blue. It will probably be true, but now I have the blue checkmark and I look like a fucking idiot and I don't think that's worth the money. You only get ad revenue from other Blue subscribers? That is also stupid. You can disable the checkmark. Guys, I think we might be buying Twitter Blue just to see if I can make money on this. Because think about this. How many likes do my tweets get?           57. 130. Okay, 240. 300? I mean, how many impressions is that? This is just me retweeting something and I got 16,000 views. That's... I mean, come on. 20,000 views? That's gotta be some money. If you get 20,000 views on YouTube, that's like $10. This could have been like $6 for me. How much is Twitter Blue? It's like $8 a month. $8? Oh shit, that's hard to get. Also, that's monthly. I need 5 million impressions in the past three months. This one got like 13,000. Shit. There was one I got that had like a lot. Was it this one? 53. That's like 1%. 100? That's like 2%. How the fuck am I gonna get 5 million impressions? Also, don't you need a credit card to buy Twitter Blue? Oh shit, I don't have a credit card. Dude, I had a million here right away, but now I'm never getting monetized on Twitter. It's over, guys. It's over. Wouldn't you all... Would I? Dude, maybe it is worth it after all. I don't know. Hello, Graham Rolls Revolution. Maybe we should just try it for a month. Okay, how about this? We prepare a few banger tweets. And then after we post the banger tweets, we buy Twitter Blue on the same day. We get the 5 million impressions. And now we have monetization enabled. And with that, we're gonna get the money for Blue back. Plus some more. And now we get more clout and more money. How's that? Okay. You guys have no idea the shit I would do for $5 a month on Twitter ad revenue. Twitter's starting to pay rent. I'd hold off until the first payouts to decide. True. All right. Though I think this one's a do next week thing. I think we're done for today. I don't know how to apply for legit verification. Either way, I think we are done here. And I will see you guys in the next stream where we finish the Wiggler guy. We make him run away. We make him pissed. We give him a few animations. And until then, bye bye. Bye bye. Bye.
