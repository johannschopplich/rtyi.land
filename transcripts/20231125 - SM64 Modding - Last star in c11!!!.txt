Real cases who up I'm not late I am just in time I was working on fixing up the zoo right now I'm going through all the levels from correspond to the last person fixing all the bugs that have appeared so that we can beta test every single level like fixing stream today now I do this off stream I started setting myself deadlines for stuff to work on right so I've done this for 14 days now and so far I fit every single deadline with these and my next deadline is to do bug fixes alongside the block out for the OBB underground so I was working on the chompy too he has a few new actions now I might actually upload just a 10 minute video on the main channel about how cute the chomp is look you can do this now or you can do this again he works with the remade area now I'm going to work on this a day maybe like I thought this meant cease wait what what is cease 2011 standard I don't understand I want to show you guys the new action states but he's not doing them they only have a 1 in 16 chance of happening so make sense there we go hey he jumped the hoop and yeah he has a new model too he looks so HD now compared to before oh my god the crystal chomp looks like dog shit any OST wishes for today we're almost ready for course 12 and I've been looking to course 12 for so long hello Hedgehog hello Sanker hello braw let me actually let the stream gang know that we are live streaming this is not a valid link it's not a valid link well is the minus Y part of it hey DVD player we have a DVD player in chat there's gonna be 15 courses I think Lila died yeah Lila has been gone for a week now I noticed that too she wasn't around anymore so we do want the entrance to here give me a little bit of a slide that comes from here I think that would be very cool please don't spend the whole stream asking me for a release date again that was miserable dude if Lila disappears before finishing the quaternion animations I will be so sad she's been working on that for so long and I've been waiting for that for so long um yeah what's our OST today I don't know it I don't want it to be honest so I'm gonna try a slide like this Mario RPG remake OST let's do that guys I need your responses to this real quick without thinking of any specific games which dead zone do you like re64 has the two dead zone but because the gate on the n64 stick is octagonal it feels like three some games are cursed enough to have four and one is a troll answer if you one you're trolling you have no idea what you're talking about but if you put four into a game you deserve to suffer legit I want to inflict pain on you for doing this second yeah second is a good choice I think third is also available but only for games that are run on like consoles where the stick is not octagonal like if I think about the xbox controller not having a guide here on the outer rim kind of sucks 64ds uses an actual d-pad so it's not actually valid that's the point to bring up I think second would be best I think so too if you have an octagonal gate but without an octagonal gate I don't know tough choice to make on how to do this mario rpg is awfully quiet right now wait it's not playing at all the hell oh no it's gonna crash guys if the stream's offline it's because obs crashes what the hell hey look we're back and this time we have audio the reason I'm more active on my second channel is because the threshold for posting something like the amount of value the video has to provide to the viewer is lower on case clips on the main channel I only want to post when I actually have something important because I don't want people to not click my videos anymore because I always post unimportant stuff so that's why on the second channel you generally just get way more content because I just don't care as much about making good content one material and two triangles are you painting the alpha channel with like the shade color or something that is kind of neat can I send you dory sure we will have to redo all the part I had to because warps in rty I have two additional parameters one for the height of the warp object the hitbox and one for the camera angle that you receive after coming out of the warp of course if you don't have one of them again you will like for a water I think anything on the background in the alpha from a mirror oh but if you use two textures you can actually go with 128 by 64 so you will have to go with 64 by 64 yeah you can't the n64 like all textures combined to take up the resolution that the n64 can hold wow this fucking sucks to go down right look fast 64 shows you this year memory usage 4096 out of 4096 bytes so right here with two different textures actually no this is twice the same texture so it's fine but there were two different textures then the team would be full I be honest I don't think a pc port of this game will ever exist I will make a public source like anyone will be able to look at the code but I seriously doubt anyone is gonna have the skill to make a pc port of this or the patience because it's just gonna take so long so well unless you just bundle an emulator which you know at that point it's just kind of silly how do we make this better I do want this to be a slides this room is under the oil rig so this is like the inner workings of the oil rig you know what we should have more moving machinery in here what if we had like a hydraulic press like this but thick I want that I'll put a bunch of those over here so my notes for this hmm okay but before I program that I want to do this hmm I think maybe the ending shouldn't be sliding and just the beginning so why don't we just say fuck and then do this should work might have to make this a bit taller  uh that does look really good but yeah it doesn't work okay well you can still combine two i4 textures and make both 64 by 64 can send can you send me like a blender file with just the sail then I can see what I can do so slide the entrance to the level it's the entrance to the sub area there's three entrances to the sub area and but only two exits basically so the idea is you just get sent down the slide when you enter the area so I think that works let's make the hydraulic platform happen just to make this look more machinery it should work almost like the up-down platform we have on top but I want variable speed here I want this to look like it's a bunch of machines just working hmm 678 by 680 that's a cursed resolution but I can work with that so basically I'm thinking of replacing a bunch of these platforms here with hydraulics like this one for sure it's gonna be a hydraulic platform it's gonna make platforming a bit more fun and it's gonna make it so that we can more easily make the player climb up especially this year should be hydraulics  you're gonna send me the file bio hmm what if you made the end up to slide a little bit of a ramp um you would get stuck and Mario would go back and forth all the time sometimes so that would be really annoying ah okay so yes I was thinking before Yoshi's Return to Yoshi's Island finishes we're gonna start working on a game in Unreal Engine I'm gonna finish like a little demo and then simultaneously with the release of Return to Yoshi's Island we are going to start a Kickstarter for this game in Unreal Engine and then we will make big money and then we will be able to just make whatever we want how does that sound I said it last time I thought I only told you No, we're not porting it to Unreal Engine 5, we're making a demo just in Unreal Engine that is unrelated to this game, for like a new game we are going to develop. That's the plan. Are you going to mod SSC when you're working on the Unreal project? Probably. I mean, I do plan to have an open source, so I will need to manage all that stuff. Any ideas for a character setting world? Yes, yes, yes. We already have a bunch of ideas for that. But I don't want any of that to be public, because, you know, I can still change my mind on everything. All right, let's look at the sail. It's definitely going to be a platformer game. All right, so how do we make this work? Okay, I see the sail is pretty high resolution. Does it need to be this high res though? Well, we definitely need this to be an IFR. That's like a given. But maybe we can combine this a little bit. There's actually some cool thing you can do with thresholding. Oh, I see, you need to preserve the effect on the side here. Makes sense. It's too bad I won, that's not an option. That'd be so good here. Yeah, I see why this won't work. Hmm. There is the option of trying to use this texture here somehow. How can we abuse this one? Implement it? Yeah, we need to change the actual hardware. Can't implement it in software. Hmm, can we make use of this? I don't think we can. Since this texture does not repeat, there's actually other things we can do. Um, we can do 8x64. So, 8192 divided by 96 maybe? 83, or 85. Maybe that's a better number. Divisors of 8192. Nothing clean. Okay, let's go with 96 then. This is one extremely cursed thing we can do. Maybe. Hmm.  How did this have to be? Ah. Hmm. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need half of this. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. We need 4096. And let's divide by 48 maybe? Okay, okay, okay. Wait, that doesn't work either. 4096 divided by 96, okay. Maybe 96 divided by 42. That doesn't look so bad. Does this work for you, Biobank? This is the most cursed texture resolution I've ever seen. I think it works. Hehe. I might have to N64 verify this, just to make sure. But this should be fine. Ah yes, my 96 by 42 texture. Hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm. Okay, how do we make this look like hydraulics? I want it to look like an accordion, but also like hydraulics. You know, like this? Maybe there's a game with an accordion? On model resource? I think I shaved that data off of there because I made it smaller. Lambert? James Lambert reference? Do you guys think Leela is still with us mentally? Like she's watching the stream in heaven? Rip Leela. I don't think Leela died, but what if we all just started acting like she did? And then when she comes back, she'll be like, what the fuck? There's a participants list? Damn, I didn't know. Rip Leela, I hope she's doing fine. I know this may sound parasocial, but I was so sad when she died. Imagine saying that on a celebrity. You know, I know this sounds parasocial, but damn, really, really sucks that they died. It's taking not being parasocial a little too far, if you ask me. Ganondorf's cape has the whole CPU generated? That seems not even good. She liked it. Rip Leela though. Too bad what's happened to her. I'm gonna put a tombstone. Are we putting the Leela tombstone into this game somewhere? So I also want it to look like a hydraulic platform like this. I kind of like the line here. I'm trying to learn Blender, but I can't figure out how to add texture. Do you want to use Fast64 or normal Blender? Do we have graves in the carnival haunted house? I feel like we don't. But I may also just have forgotten. There's a sewer problem in my house and water got out from the pipes, so I got a plumber and now everything is fine. Okay, you are excused. We did write you up earlier, Creeper, but I'm fine with that excuse. Oh, right there. We do have that. Oh, this texture is awesome. I think the color of this one doesn't fit the level. Check my Discord. Rev Leela. This is so sad. I'm going to post this on a simple Discord. I'm going to post this on a simple Discord. Will she respond to that? No. How would she respond to that? She is literally dead. Okay, this looks good. Let's get the color right. I do kind of like it. The scale texture is still 128x64. I will just send you the texture. I definitely scaled the texture down. Yeah, look. Okay. Hmm, yeah. Just add two of these. Actually, no, that's too little. It's going to be so little that it's going to be obvious again. Dude, can you believe it? It's almost Christmas. You know what the best part about Christmas is? The ad revenue on YouTube is so high. I'm making bank around Christmas. Like, holy shit. You suddenly just get a 50% pay raise if you are a YouTuber. And the craziest part is, everyone's asking you for sponsorship. Honkai Star Rail wrote me. They want me to make a video about their anime tiddy game. I think very fitting. If you know anything about my channel, it's that I'm all about Super Mario 64 and anime boobs. The two things I'm famous for. I'm definitely taking that sponsorship. I think I came in at the wrong time. No, no, no. This is the right time. Didn't someone already do that? I think someone already did. Wait, didn't I already do that? Didn't I make Hot Tub Mario? Did someone else make Hot Tub Mario 64? I don't know. I swear there's a mod called Hot Tub Mario 64. Where Mario has one of those e-girl Twitch streamer wheels. Yeah, the one with the wheel. And then there's a wheel that says, like, squats and backflips and stuff. Yeah, when did I do this? Where is this? Is this on Rawmaking.com? It's not on Rawmaking.com. Where is this mod? Let me check my DMs with SimbaFlips. I don't know where it is. Where did the Hot Tub Mario mod go? Where did I post it? But Zayna remembers it too. I don't know where it is. SuperFatio64? SuperFatio64? I can't find it. It's gone! LostMedia?  Beautiful. That would be the LostMedia. Hello, GiraffeVineStarry. It's crazy that that hack is lost. Wait, let me go to my main channel and see if I can find it. Searching a channel. Thought. Wasn't there, like, a bunch of small commission hacks I released all at once? I can't find it. It's gone. Crazy. Maybe someone on Twitter knows, maybe I should just post a tweet. Anyone remember that hack with Mario having huge tits and being a hot tub? Where did that go? Is this the song that played after Lila died? It's gone? What if Nintendo took the video down? How insane would that be? My streaming room changed? My house changed? We moved? We now live in a house? Like an actual real house? Music played at Lila's funeral was the metal pipe sound? Oh, makes sense. This kinda looks nice. Somehow this platform's art style doesn't fit together at all. It doesn't work for me. Something about this is just wrong. I think it's this texture here that doesn't work. Is it just me? You type 30 on Mario 64 and Google has no result? Dude, this is the most lost media of all time. I feel like he made that hack for SimpleFlips because he needed it for something. But I'm not sure. Maybe we never released it, because I just sent it to SimpleFlips. Let me check his file. Is this Chaos? I have one file here and the message just says the deed is done and then it's a ROM. So I don't know what this is. Let's check out this ROM. I don't know what this is. I don't know what this is. You made one for Wheel of Fortune 64. I don't think this released ever. Release it for the Honkai Sponsorship? Oh, that is so insane. That is such a good idea. Let me know when you should do it. Yep, yep. Absolutely. Oh, that would be so funny. Let me write the Honkai Star Wreck guy real quick. This was six days ago. Oh, she said she would get back to me as soon as to hear from the brand. Dude, Nintendo is going to hate that, especially with the new guidelines. What if I just titled the video What I Think of the New Nintendo Guidelines? And then it's just that. Nintendo is going to have an aneurysm. Shigeru Miyamoto will just die from a heart attack when he sees that. Main channel potential? I mean, if this is a sponsorship, I will have to do it on the main channel. Otherwise, they would not pay me. Hello, Clayman. Guten Tag. Let's reveal, though. Nintendo Hitman could not take me on. Dude, the internal texture finding stream. You gotta love it. It would be Ryuko. I would absolutely reset alongside. That would be so funny. And the Honkai guys, they pay big. I feel like $3,000, $4,000 is a possibility. That's like we can do so much money. We can do so much with that money. I should hire people to just make videos for me because I hate making videos. But I also don't know who would be a good match for that, because you need to be so technically inclined. Sucks being me. Oh, this kind of works. But it doesn't look much like a hydraulic anymore. Man. For example, Christmas gift to buy a bag through. I feel like when RTYI releases, I want to pay the musician to have the rights to the music and then release an album for RTYI. I think that would be very fun. And the album would be like an N64 cartridge. Because we can't legally do that. I'm pretty sure at least. Imagine having an N64 cartridge to this album. How cool would that be? Yeah, this kind of works, I think. There's 15 courses in RTYI. At least that's the plan. Yeah, exactly. It would be like a ROM that's just an MP3 player. Yeah, I think this works as a hydraulic platform. It's only one fifth done. This is course 11. And there's 15 courses in the game. So we are at least two thirds done. And a lot of the work was making the engine too. So it's more like... Reforce maybe? You had 50? 50 courses? 350 stars? Don't you think that's a little bit overkill? That'd be bigger than all Mario games ever released combined. Bigger than Odyssey? Question mark, question mark. Yeah, Biomech, exactly that. Honestly, yes. Odyssey... I mean, Odyssey kind of works. But when you first play it, you expect it to be more than what it actually is. At least I did. Because I feel like a lot of the content in Odyssey is like Call Rocks in ROTW. And that like, yeah, it's kind of nice to find it. But finding all of it would be cock and ball torture. So to me, Odyssey is more like just a bunch of blue coins and sunshine without the shines. You know, it's like, yeah, it's kind of fun to run around. And it gives you an excuse to explore the world. But it's not really fun to actively seek them out. You know what I mean? Am I making sense here? Just move to another object, I will pick the right accordion. Actually, I am French. Oh, are French accordions? Yeah, I am gonna do that. I'm actually just programming it now. Yeah. That's actually crazy. The only main stars hold value twice in the entire series. Damn. How did they get away with that? They're in their new Switch mindset where they could pick up the gameplay for three minutes and put it down. That's fair, honestly, yeah. It does work for that mindset. That would explain it. Is this the cooking song? I have an area node here? Oh, fuck. I went in an object. The catch-enemies here were pretty good, too. The thing about Bowser's Fury that I don't like is that you kind of just aimlessly wander around. And the game forces you to go to an island and then go away. So it feels very repetitive to me. Very formulaic in what you actually do. Is this the Yoshi race? Oh, I remember being completely unable to beat that. How the fuck do you win the Yoshi race? Honest question, guys. Who is your literally me character? Like in movies and shit. Who do you pick as your literally me? MarioFat? I mean, Bowser's Fury is kind of nice. I kind of liked it. Didn't really need the run button. But other than that... I don't know if that's a controversial take. Not a fan of run buttons. Boo! Boo! He has run buttons! Boo! I have never read Lovecraft, so I wouldn't know. Boo! Boo! So maybe I'm that one Mimi Final Fantasy Soul Snake. The must kill chaos guy. Love him that guy. I have no idea what you're talking about. Boo! Fuck the Yoshi of the week? Okay. Then it's fucked up. Boo! I'm kind of lost. I have two objects that basically do the same thing. But it's not a big loss. You know what? I hate that we have two platforms doing the same thing. I'm just gonna... Oh, nevermind. I'm good. Audion Geo doesn't exist. That's crazy. I imported the Nintendo of the Wing Cap? Really?  What could possibly be a horror beyond human comprehension? I mean, clearly that doesn't exist, right? Like, not even in fantasy. Yes, how could we make up that? Something that we can't comprehend can humans make up something that they can't comprehend like i mean okay laser swords because they don't make any sense you can't comprehend them does that count doesn't make sense can't come in because you comprehend that it doesn't make sense well but everything we don't comprehend doesn't make sense nope it's still be cool to do that one day but that day is not today  n64 vr would be quite awful i imagine you know what's surprising we don't have more 3d tvs how come there isn't a 3d tv in almost every household what happened to humanity are we not prosperous anymore i don't remember anything about serene fusion but i did play a bit of it i don't think i liked it very much but i don't remember i mean the thing about that time effect is yes they are consistently good but they're also just not very interesting at least that's how i feel big 2d owns the market i mean i mean by definition because big 3d isn't doing anything but i don't know if it was real 3d or simpleflips was just f*****g with everyone because i imagine simpleflips just pretended it's 3d yeah smg23 i think dude that was the only good troll i get in the competition just because i thought it was funny which is very subjective but i don't know if it was real 3d or simpleflips was just f*****g with everyone but it's the only funny one so far i go pshhh when it shrinks true true true so am i a grumpy old man or are troll hacks just really not funny like in the competition that there was it can only be one of those two what would rtyi look like it would look exactly how it does unless you give me a thing with raytracing oh well it would look the same but raytraced been made yet but the hack where it shows a cool looking level and then it sends you to the end screen was funny i did not see that that does sound funny too so damn i don't know if only we had a way to look at the game in hd hello btork well but if you say beyond human comprehension that applies that humans are not physiologically able to comprehend but therefore every single human is unable that's what i'm reading here okay looks solid now just needs to move isn't an n67 plugin for doing raytracing i think uh yes there's one being worked on but it's not finished yet but the dev is doing a good job i mean i would have interest in modding other games if it was paying my bills just as much as r64 but we don't live in that world so i cannot do that so what have i done everything is talking about raspbian yep okay so the b-params here should decide a velocity at which we move instead of just this because i want this to be like pistons that go up and down at different speeds be cool if they were set actually no we don't want the rhythm to sync up at all  I don't think I really want them to pause for very long. So BPM1 is the pause duration, BPM3 is the speed. Let's go with like 30, actually 22 and add 20. And BPM2 is the amount of time divided by 4 that we go for. Let's try 20 here. This should hopefully look decent. Wait, top seed is still on the thing. There we go. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. You can stop now, chill. Okay, well the idea was good. Mmm. Hmmhmmm, why is this happening? Okay. Scale 1, that is not, that should not be a requirement. Let's start this off at 25% scale. Then it should go fast and then come back. I don't see how this could potentially even do that. Which is not good at all actually. And this is why I want them to be one behavior, so we don't have to deal with this shot. But here we are. Oh well, I guess we do this twice now. It's fine. I saw a hack that uses the RTYI engine. Why? What? Why are doors always so fucked up when you're- That's because we are changing some things about the animations. And until we have Lila's quaternion animation exporter, R.I.P. Lila, we cannot fix the doors. Or, well, we can, but we'd have to redo the fix as soon as we have the quaternion animations from Lila. R.I.P. Lila. Have you been watching my stream, AAAA? Have I been using the blender plugin? What do you think? Oh, oh, um... This is why. O E R E O E R I'm not sure what I'm doing here. Okay, some oddities, but... I mean, the culling obviously is a big issue. And it seems to grow over time. And the object order is wrong. The object order is wrong. Oh, and that's bothersome. I can be hard-set to scale- Oh, there we go. I can be hard-set to scale- Oh, there we go. I can be hard-set to scale- Oh, there we go. I think that was gonna be a spring. No, no, no, it's a piston. I want a bunch of these to be around. I think it's just gonna be a lot nicer looking with a bunch of moving platforms. And that's why I want these around. Literally the only reason. Release Worm's Fortress? I still have to do that. I completely don't have time. Now, let's actually set the culling areas here. So, I am going to cheap-out on the culling area and just make it big. So, I am going to cheap-out on the culling area and just make it big. Otherwise, we would have to recompute this every tick, and I don't like that.  Is this a... that amount? And... 340, 339. So, 340, 339 is more. Square root of 340 multiplied by 340 plus 339 multiplied by 339 plus 75 multiplied by 75 is 486. This will remove the culling issue. They are going to assassinate me around midnight. How many stars? Like 180, maybe? Alright, culling issue is fixed. Still need to change the update order. Still need to change the update order. This is just not good right now. Oh, but this looks really cool. I don't like that it looks like you can't go to the top of that. How the fuck do we fix the update order? We have to invert this, don't we? Oh, this is going to be a bit of work. Why? What's wrong with Zelda Indigo? Do you hate them or something? Spawner, that's how we do it. This should fix the update order. I think a good bunch of them will switch to my engine, Mickey. It will be very cool to see a bunch of people interacting with the source code and trying to make it work. Do I need to update this first? No way. How is this going wrong? Is this 60 FPS code? It's still doing that. Now it's tuning in even more. The hell? Why would it do this? Honestly, I don't know. Hello, Glaceu. I'm doing well. Oh. This is why. This needs to happen first, obviously. Why did they add a frame of delay to that? The fucked up pause bug? No, I haven't. That's honestly going to be part of a bigger investigation into why speedrunners say that 30 FPS mode in this game lags. It's a good hint, though. I noted it down somewhere. But I'm not going to fix it for now. I am planning to make it so that if you are in 30 FPS mode, what's going to happen is that the gameplay thread becomes part of the rendering thread. The other way around. The rendering thread goes into the gameplay thread. And that will allow us to increase the FPS, actually. Oh my god, this feels so weird. Get a 30. Get a 30. Get a 30. Get a 30. Get a 30. Alright, let's make sure they all work fine. Who's spamming the hearts? Dude, I wish this was like those TikToks. Where you can do like the NPC streamer thing. But you would have to pay me. Mmm, hearts, so good. Yum yum. What happened to that? Is that still a thing? Thanks for the glizzy. No spicy.  That trend passed too quickly. I want no spicy girl to come back. Gang gang. Ice cream, so good. No, I think the no spicy one was way better. No spicy.  Get a 30. Get a 30. Get a 30. I thought that whole comment was Spanish for a second. I don't think I use modern game design. I don't like modern game design. Modern game design is made for people that are depressed and just want to erase time. Not for people that want to go have an experience. That's what I see in modern game design. Oh, I really like this now. These backdrops are very cool. Custom menu? Like the pause menu? It already does. Startup menu? What's a startup menu? What is a startup menu, guys? I need to know the answer to that question first. Yeah, it has a file select. But the file select is a 3D level like in Mario Sunshine. Dude, wait. Can you do that? Oh, that would be so sick. Jump, jump. No, no. Jump, jump. Jump, jump. Spin. I guess I can do that, but that's the boring way of doing it. I wanted to land on the ramp directly. I want speedruns of this game to be like crazy. Okay. The game boots you directly into the file select. The game doesn't waste your time. That is important to me. Can we put more hydraulics here somehow? Anywhere where it would make sense. I think this one should just be replaced by a random hydraulic. Just because it looks cool. And that's the entire reasoning behind it. Bowser is the type of guy who would design his factory after what looks cool. Thoughts on not going back to the hub when you die? What would happen instead? I actually have a really good method for making a good difficulty curve. And that is that I don't try to make the levels more difficult. I just put the threshold of how cool a jump has to be for it to be worth the difficulty lower. So generally what I do is I don't make difficulty just for the sake of difficulty. I make it like, okay, I want a cool jump here. But this jump would be too difficult. Let's put this jump into a later level. That way you automatically just end up with cool levels. Put it back to the start of the level. I think I prefer the player I'm going to before the level. Because then you can still decide to go somewhere else. It also feels more impactful, more definite, more like you died. Compared to just respawning with less health that you do when you fade out sometimes. And yeah, generally I do try to make it work for a bad audience. But there's mechanics in the game to help bad players. Like if you're bad at jumping, you can always use this move here. Which makes you kind of slow. But it's like super easy. Okay. I want more pistons. We need more pistons here. This will be Pistonville. Let's have this one not be a piston. But maybe one of these? This one here? This one is a piston. Regretting for starting the game without having to do all the stuff is frustrating. That is also true. I don't know, it's difficult between... What is the trade-off here? I mean, when you make things lose impact for the sake of making your game less frustrating, you are always shifting your game a little further towards the arbitrary playground style. I don't know if I'm describing that well. That move just doesn't provide a move. Well, you can just decide not to use it. Hello, Speedy. Oh, you're gonna have to wait a little longer, but the game is making good progress. This is a Final Fantasy song, is it not? We're playing Chocobo's Dungeon right now. I've never played a Final Fantasy game before, and I swear this song exists in-game like 15 times. It plays everywhere. 2022? I mean, a two-year development phase wouldn't be so crazy. And I guess we were on course 8 or 9 in 2022? But the demo did release in 2021, so it's coming out a year after. But only three courses done? Kind of unlikely. Although then again, Last Impact did only take two years. But much worse tooling. Rewards for achieving Harder Mir without completion time. Hmm. I don't want to take away from the play of freedom. I feel like you shouldn't feel free to use all your movement. And not be like, oh, I can't use this, because if I do this, then I can't get 100%. Development started, I think, late 2022? Uh, 2020? I think? I'm not sure. I did not keep track. Keep in mind, though, that I did get a full-time job, like, recently. I don't know when. And that I have been making a lot more videos and optimizations and shit. My videos used to be just, like, previews. Now I actually have to make decent videos. Honestly, come to think of it, now that I think about it, my YouTube channel is not making more profit than it was when I was just making shitposts. And even though people care much less about that, maybe that is the correct way of doing it. Maybe I should just go back to shitposts instead of making decent videos. Shitpost tags were doing much better than educational videos. Why not combine the two? I can also do that, but having two wildly different video styles like that usually just means you lose a huge portion of your audience and it kind of fucks with the algorithm. Okay, let's put chains on these. Actually, let's hide the Yoshi coins in here. Let's see which Yoshi coin is that. Coin number five. Very short remix you could make. I mean, you could always do the stupid YouTube shitpost thing where it's like, oh, Mario 64, but every time you collect the coin, his voice goes higher. You know, just random shit like that. Well, but shitpost tags usually are not a fun idea, G1. And it's also not what the people that are subscribed to my YouTube really want to see, I think. But no, I am perfectly aware that effort and results are weakly correlated. I have no delusion in that regard. We still have to pick a color for the Yoshi coins in this level. Fun and fair Mario 64. Yeah, that would be a fun hack to finish. But that's not where the views are. Well, I don't want to make more content, though. That's the thing, I hate making content. I'm just trying to keep my YouTube channel alive while I'm making this hack. Yeah, easy. Okay, and what color works here? Oily Boily Bay. Very colorful, maybe green? Actually, no, green eggs. I think we already used those. Did we write down the colors? Ah, that's a crack egg. Not what we want. Yoshi coin colors. Pink. Turquoise. Yellowish. Light blue. This one's just white. Oh, there's a lot of black ones. Red, green, blue. Greenish. Purple. We already have turquoise. That's the thing, we want a different color in every level. Purple. And it looks like we have purple here in Quest 10. So this is Oily Boily Bay. But have you played the Mario RPG Remake? No. I didn't finish the Orange RPG either. I got pretty far in it and then I felt like it's getting very boring and I just stopped. Crimson? Isn't that just red? Gold. Dark blue. Gold could kinda work, yeah? What's gold RGBs like? I'm a programmer for a living. I work at Gears for Breakfast. This one's black too. Wait, which ones are those? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 6 and 7. I don't know which courses this is. Either way, we do need to fix that at some point. I don't know which courses this is.  Either way, we do need to fix that at some point. Do gold RGBs work in Oily Boily Bay or is this something that fits better for Oily Boily Bay? Isn't gold too close to what we already have here? The orange? This is basically gold. Maybe a colorless gray would work. We do want the coin to stand out. Maybe a darker blue? I think I like a darker blue. I think I like a darker blue. The problem with darker blue is that it's always looking so contrastless. But it might work. Okay, I think I still have to make the Koopa. I have to do texts and everything. It still says the same shit that the guy on the outside says. And the soap bar should respawn. Getting the soap bar over here is a bit tricky. Here is a really cool challenge now. I very much like it. I feel like I can increase the radius of this. Because if you're going to do this twice, this will be really annoying. I should team up with the guy that made shotgun mario well why which is one of us benefits from that what's the deal here yeah exactly what i was saying is i i want to increase the radius size too okay let's do six and five i guess this will clean a lot more and this should now give me coin number four what's your age i'm 17 we should be like i think you're bringing me soap don't worry i'll do it myself and insert some shell i mean that would be funny but why i don't know if i understand what does this do for us cleaning a small spot of oil near a wall in the white sounds not very fun that's fair one of his soft is by making the area that you are able to move around and bigger though i do want mario to clean this up guess the truth is i'm not 17 i'm 19 and i would never lie to you guys when you sometimes look like you're going for a midlife crisis i don't know i'm not going for a midlife crisis what do you mean i don't think i will ever have a midlife crisis isn't that when you're like 40 and you were like oh man i actually didn't achieve shit in my life did i already achieved so much in my life i had a fucking insane life i made mods yes yeah this seems a lot better it's nicer with mario and realize everything is okay yep some other levels you made them fit in but then here he doesn't for some reason is it vertex covering it's because this area is unfinished and it's all very dark and the lighting doesn't match between mario and the alignment we're still working on it  what the hell why are these connected they're not connected why is blender saying they are so that's what do you mean faced with me that works in uv editor i have no idea crazy This texture looks good honestly I used to have an art teacher in school that would hate me I don't know why though, she would just fucking hate me She told me that one time she saw me linger around her house and that I was calling her a witch and I was like wtf that never happened I think she was schizophrenic Will those be mistaken for stairs? Will the stairs be mistaken for stairs? I hope not I've given the opportunity though, why would you call her a witch? Well I was given the opportunity and I didn't And why would I linger around her house? She's in general, yeah she was also my German teacher Oh my god, the teacher is a witch And a hexer Do you know where she lived? Yes actually, I did She lived in like a really big really compound house I don't know how she could afford that, like thinking back on it Honestly she kind of lived in a witch house, maybe she was a witch Teachers are extremely well paid really, I keep hearing that teachers are underpaid Is it just like a Canadian thing? Or like an American thing? How much do teachers make in the U.S.? Oh okay, yeah I know Wait then why do people become teachers? Isn't that just a bad decision? Why do you purposely make a bad decision? Like you go to university, you spend years learning your subject, you spend years learning how to teach Just to be underpaid? What are you stupid? 2000 to 6000, that's a big range Nobody wants to be a teacher? Well clearly they do, if people are teachers and they are underpaid, then they have to be so many teachers, then they can choose to underpay and still find people to work for them right? That's what my economic intuition is telling me right now Usually the only fields that are underpaid are those that people like to do Shoulder just everywhere oh the teachers you know don't like teaching too then why did I become teachers then you have to go to university and all that stuff like it's not easy to become a teacher when you become a teacher if you don't like teaching you don't understand well actually I would get that maybe you are like oh cute children I get to work with children isn't that nice and then you actually do work with children you're like holy shit I fucking hate children that's like fair honestly like the naivety of a young 20 year old going to university to learn teaching not realizing children are little shits and you're gonna can you imagine working with children in the age like 13 to 17 oh my god people in that range are the worst active-faced must be a courthouse is not a court what the hell huh what happened here how did this happen okay let's just delete this do that again cases most of you are starting to 17 no most of my viewers are in their 20s you on 16 you think kids aren't total unbearable demons honestly yeah that was my experience too I remember like in high school the people that got bullied they stopped getting bullied around like 10th and 11th grade and people just kind of started ignoring them I don't know if that's a universal experience every now and then there's so much I was probably born at that that's true but honestly people in that range they can't know that they are terrible human beings you know it's fine they probably think hey he's talking about the other 16 and 13 year olds not me that's fine like they don't know we mean them Making It Worse Oh Damn I had no idea you were so young Michi I'm sure they're people born in 2012 than Amari 64 My bag will finally be free from my bullying next year true two more years until case stops hating me can't Yeah, 16 to 7 year olds throwing firecrackers at random people sounds about right Oh We finished Amari RPG OST What do we listen to next $1 versus $10 million job by mr. Beast Oh What the hell it didn't export oh, I forgot to fuse this with the level. Yeah. Oh shit Wait, how is this going? What the hell Oh what oh Oh There we go one dollar versus one, okay ten million dollars OST Surely we'll find something It's the ten million dollar OST I Mean the only one who doesn't like them now See, okay when I watch mr. Beast video, but I study them. I don't watch them because I enjoy them I watch them because I want to know why this guy gets so many views. How can I take advantage of this? and I Don't like them at all. I mean some of them I don't like at all Especially like recently, a lot of it is just very boring. But it is lowest common denominator stuff, obviously. Let me check that the warp is here too. If the warp is here, I think this area is all good. Oh, we still need to program the oil enemy, I just realized. There's supposed to be an oil puddle enemy that kind of works like the enemies from 3D World. The bits or something like that. We can listen to Pizza Tower OST sometime. It is definitely aim2wants.tiktok addicted to it actually. Maybe. I don't know if aiming stuff at children is as lucrative anymore as it was in the 90s. Because the birthrate is so low now. I feel like a lot of stuff is not made for children anymore, but rather for older people. Oh, this looks good now. Oh, this looks good. I think that people addicted to TikTok are mostly millenials. It's gonna be real with you. Very jaded people. They just want to delete time out of their day. They don't want experiences, they just want it to be over. That's my impression of people that use TikTok. Oh, that didn't work. Okay, I actually also want to add rails here. You're literally deleting, yeah, that is what it does. That's like the whole purpose of it, right? That's the only reason you do it. You're just like, oh, let's delete my day. Just two more weeks until I'm happy. Just two more weeks until I'm happy. Just two more weeks until I'm happy. And then two more weeks comes around, and it's just two more weeks until you're happy. Maybe that was too real. I apologize, guys. There are a lot of metal industrial levels in this game. How many are there? The Bob-omb factory? What else? Is that a cross? No, this is a fence. I wonder if boomers had it this way as well. I don't know if boomers ever thought much about the meaning of their life, but there might also be a lot of selection bias because the boomers that you talk to are the ones who have a successful career or a family. You talk to your parents and your parents' friends, mostly, that's like the boomers you talk to. So you have a selection bias to talk to successful ones. Hmm, shit, what else do we pick? Songs for good vibes. Doesn't that sound good? Boomers had it so easy, they never had to think about anything. I don't know if that's true. Pop garbage, my ears out there burning. But this is an anime girl on the thumbnail, can't be bad. Wait. I know what we listen to. I know exactly what we listen to. Oh shit, where's the song? What the hell? Okay, nevermind, I can't find it. You guys are safe for me. What OST? Any OST? I'll pick it. You know what? Pizzatella, fuck it. Never heard someone complain about the Pizzatella OST that much, damn. I'm not gonna play Mind Diamonds for free. If you want Mind Diamonds to play, you have to pay up. It is what it is. There is a thief for torturing me, basically, that's what I'm saying. This one's terrible, awesome. There are no plans. One minute, one minute of Mind Diamonds, alright. He paid, you know what? Oh shit, Leela is here. I thought you died, Leela. Did you not see my post? R.I.P. Leela. I saw your post. We all thought you died, Leela. Is the post saying Leela is dead? Yes, that's true. Alright, guys. I'm doing Take On Me now. That's your conclusion? Yeah, we all thought you died. We had a whole burial for you earlier during the stream, Leela, with sad music and everything. I really like this song, it sounds good. Mine in the way. I don't know.                Donation? Oh, wait. I've been devastated by your death, you haven't finished your Quaternions. True. I would have cried so hard over the Quaternions. But no, you were gone the whole week, Leela, we all thought you died. Oh, it's easy to have a microphone this awful. You just have to turn the game on. How is this? Is my microphone just as awful right now? No? The hell? I thought it would be awful. Not squeaking? Yeah, true. Oh, my God! So far I got two! Look, the guy paid to torture us, and that's what it is. Anyone else remember when we thought all Minecraft players was this? We all thought they were little children, and now people are nostalgic for it? It's gonna happen to Fortnite as well. People are gonna start being nostalgic for Fortnite as soon as Fortnite kinda like stops being so popular. I would have had enough for two cumshakes by now. Dang, never got to have the cumshakes. The OG Season is doing numbers? Oh, really? I thought people hated it. Alright. Alright, glad that's over. I remember DanBit naming all the textures he sent me in Fortnite. Back then Fortnite was like the thing young people play. They broke their all-time player count several times? Holy shit. I kind of doubt it. I think Minecraft had a lot more brilliant things than Fortnite, especially for its time. Well, Fortnite's still doing numbers, so. It's kinda just doing way better right now, if we're being fair. I always thought it would be silly for me to play Minecraft, because I already have Blender. I can literally just leak everything I want. Minecraft is the better game on objective points? Wait, how? When you don't just snap your finger and have a Minecraft done? No, but I can make whatever I want way quicker in Blender than in Minecraft. That's what I'm saying. I'm not saying I'm making Minecraft, I'm saying any building I make in Minecraft I can do faster in Blender. So I just never saw a point to playing that. If that makes sense. Not 1-2-1 you can't? No? What if I take... What if I make the assets from Minecraft in Blender and then I just use those to stitch together whatever I want? It's a toaster all over again. I'm actually going to get rid of this for now. I'm actually just going to... Oh, my keyboard switched to German mode. No wonder it didn't work. I'm out of music again. You made a Pizza Tower, was there only one song on Pizza Tower? I think it only played one song. It's okay, YouTube autoplay decided on something way better than Pizza Tower. Gabe Bloss, but the song is sick. I have a quartz keyboard, but I have swapped the Y and the Z key in the BIOS. So my keyboard says QWERTY, but it actually is a quartz layout. Song is called Follow You from Sonic Heroes. You know, I had the thought, I think video games should have character songs more. Like the way the Sonic games had it at first. I don't know why they dropped it. Same with anime. I know anime sometimes does, but not nearly to this degree. It's not like lyrical and like full of feeling and something. You know, it doesn't instantly shift the entire mood once a character appears. I want that. Always been out of place to you? But at least have characters, even if you don't do it lyrical, at least give them a song with a strong vibe. That's what I mean. I think anime should do that more. Every character should have a theme song. And once they come on screen, save the day or ruin the day, the song should just fucking go. Undertale did that? I never noticed that in Undertale. Hello Epic Spidey. For all the characters? Damn. How come I never noticed? I don't know. I don't know. Have you guys seen the new Sonic game and do you agree that it looks like a new Sonic Adventure? Because I have seen people tell me, hey, this is the new Sonic Adventure. And I looked at it and I said, this is not a new Sonic Adventure. It doesn't look like it. I do not accept this as a new Sonic Adventure. And I am the Arbiter of Truth, so that's got to mean something. I'm invited to your funeral? Wait, are you announcing your funeral? Dude, I don't like this. Can you never touch the Sonic game? Are you missing out? No. Basically all Sonic games are terrible. Except for Sonic Adventure 1 and Sonic Adventure 2, who are also terrible, but... They have a few sections which are some of the best video games ever. Sick, you won't have it your own way. Can't hold on much longer, I will never let go. Illness reveal party. Imagine, your doctor just brings in free balloons and you pop them. And it's like, ah, you have... Something. I don't want to say anything in specific. Open your heart and you will see. The classic Sonic games are completely unplayable, if you ask me. I cannot see shit in this game. You know what, at least you can see in front of Sonic. Oh, never mind. Yep, see, this is the issue with every Sonic game ever. You can't see the level. Like, look at the stuff that is on the right side of the screen, like right here. How many frames do I have? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. You have 8 frames until you interact with the thing. It's not even a quarter of a second. This is how many... Okay, this is only 30 FPS. Still, that's 8 frames, with probably like 2 frames of input length. That's 6 frames. A fifth of a second, 200 milliseconds. You cannot react to something in 200 milliseconds. And get out of the way, too. It's literally just, hope for the best. I know it's a one-way track. Tell me how long is the last. I'm not gonna think... Lila can't arc. In heaven, Lila can. Oh my god, this... The railings change everything about this area. Like, the entire vibe just completely changed for me. Oh, and I forgot to use staircases here. Okay. This is a pretty difficult Yoshi coin to get. That's the song Respawn. That was just to get rails. Oh. Sub doesn't respawn, okay. Let's make the sub respawn. Oh. Dude, Lila, I got so much shit done recently, you have no idea. I've been doing zero slacking. I finished a whole video yesterday. And I fixed most of the bugs in Quest 4. This song is a banger. Can you repeat the dialogue? I haven't said the dialogue yet. Who is Neko arc? This is definitely a cat girl drinking... Uranium? Oh, I love what you do. I love this song. It's so funny. Why is she a better singer than Britney Spears? This is the Pizza Tower OST. I don't know when they added this. Okay. Let's see if the sub will respawn. It did not. What the hell? It needed to respawn because this would have always been there. Again. I don't want to extend the floor down. This is gonna be oil. I was actually gonna add the oil. The more you guys say no, the more I say yes. Oh my god. All right. If it's oil, can you just surf across it? Yes. But it is kind of difficult to get out of the oil here. There isn't really a way to get up here again. Except for here. So you will not do it. I mean, we can check real quick that that's true. We can verify. Let's verify. Around 75% of the game is complete. Maybe 80%. I would say. Okay. It also needs to set the model again. Let's see. When do I have to set the model? It doesn't make any sense. Let's see. No, you can't just jump up here. You have to go all the way. Okay. I mean, you can also come from here. There's many options actually for the soap. Do we add particle object first and then despawn us? That's not sure. Doesn't matter. But I still want to do it like this. Please be a good sign now. All right. No, we're not missing the crazy bus. So I think we're going to add the oil here. And then on top of the oil, we are going to add. Some decals, maybe. Oil water is the material. Papaya. Okay. Do you think she meant to say I had to save it? But because she's Japanese, she said I had to shave it. It doesn't sound very Japanese. Never mind about that. She had to shave it. I get it. Okay. Leela gets it. Never mind. That makes sense then. I'm going to add some bubbles. Make it boiling bubbly oil. Then we can just bounce off it. Oh, I like that. How do we make it boiling? What's the visual effect for that? Lava bubbles. I don't know about that. Fire probably looks very cheap on N64. I do not know why it's just white. Donation or something? Thank you for the free dollar donation. Did I miss that? Is that supposed to play? I think it's supposed to play. Our world's very first Verdex animations. Okay. Let me just log into Streamlabs. Find what song you just requested and then play it. All right. Oh, there we go. Okay. Oh, I found it. Don't worry. I'm too high, I can't come down. Oxic is kind of a bugger. I think this lava effect needs Verdex animations to work at all. Well, it does not mean like oil outside, considering it has water mixed in. Yeah, it's exactly what Violet said. It's a very important part of the machinery. Part of the refining process. You wouldn't get it. You're not an oil expert like me and Biobank. How does boiling oil look like? Oh, what the hell? Boiling petrol? This is all cooking oil. This remix kind of works. Very fast Verdex animations. Okay. I'm thinking about this. It looks like chocolate melting hot. Maybe like boiling chocolate. How does that look? Okay. Can we use boiling chocolate as a template? That's not boiling! Why is no one on Google Images boiling chocolate when you look for boiling chocolate? How do we make it look like the oil is boiling? What even does boiling oil look like? Isn't it just burning? Hello, Yoshi Melt Man. Welcome to trying to think of what a boiling oil would look like. Oil doesn't boil until something is inside of it. That doesn't sound right. Boiling oil, okay. This looks more like oil. Any GIFs? This is just water. Damn it. Like lethal lava? Just boil yourself on stream, dude. That's an insane idea. Does it look like lethal lava? Oh yeah, I was blank. This doesn't feel right. There's just plenty of bubbles moving vertices up and down real quick. Is it just going to be blackish with some reflections? On top of the reflections, we just have a bunch of bubble vertices everywhere? Because I can do that. Boiling tar, that's what I want. But what does boiling tar look like? Boiling tar stock video. Interesting. Very, very reflective. What if we make it look like the fire from that one? That dino lava we have. I think that fits. It's very dark, very reflective. Bubbles and some smoke. Let me open the image again. Let me see if I can find some more. Boiling. Oh, this is perfect. So to do very reflective lava. Reflective black tar boiling as underground. Mario goes ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Smoke bubbles. And add oil. We're going to work on those two things. That will be it for today. This has been a three hour stream already. But now we know what this should look like. And I think the area is done gameplay-wise. We just need to polish up the visuals a little bit. And I will see you guys next stream. Bye-bye.
