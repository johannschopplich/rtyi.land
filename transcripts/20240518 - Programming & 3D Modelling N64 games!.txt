Hello, hello. Everything's frozen, I think it stopped being frozen. Hello, Paper Kitty, you are in the first. Amazing. You did it. Congratulations. Hello, Clayman. Hello, Silly. Hello, Selton. Hello, Tea Time. Hello, Zayna. Hello, Nintendo for Life. Hello, Imagine. Hello, the guy with the Japanese name. I do not speak Japanese. Don't know what it means. Because 13 is an ice castle. Hello, Anima. You say hello, Kittles. I don't see Kittles in chat. Yahoo! Just saw your favorite on Twitch. Oh, no. No, no, no, Wattabark. We already have the level themes planned. Yahoo! Wahoo! Yahoo! Wahoo! So, I kind of made like the general outline for what I want this level to be like. But I actually haven't like programmed the platforming parts yet. So, what our next goal is going to be, I think it's going to make all the platforming pieces, all the 3D models for it. And then to make fun platforming with it. It's the frame around my... Hello, are we back? Hello, Tyran. Hello, Sonic the Hedge. Bye, Sonic the Hedge God. Yeah, so what I did is I moved the frame in OBS and it instantly fucking crashed. So, that's what happened. No, it wasn't Biobak. It was the guy that asked why my frame is off-center. That guy crashed the stream. Hello, Vellze. Anyway, today our goal is to kind of greybox the level, I guess. Outline the level. I don't know if greybox is the correct word here. Basically, make the platforming good.  Hello, Sayo. What OST shall we pick today? We are never going to listen to the B3313 OST. You guys can stop trying that right now. That combined with fuck would make very crazy appearing labyrinth. Oh, you are right. That would look crazy. Super Paper Mario. All right, let's do it. I'm not just playing a single song. The language pivot. Ba ba ba ba ba.  Papi papa baba. Bro speaking the Mario language in my chat right now. 3 out of 5 areas done. The factories and say no, only the office and boss area to go. Okay. And those are the smallest areas. So, that sounds pretty promising. Actually, I don't know if I can do an F3 this year. Because I'm going to have a child releasing in a bit. Yes, that's the plan. Tea time. Eiza had like a special plan for the video. So, let's see how that goes. Eiza wanted it to make like a little bit of a documentary thing almost. So, I'm waiting for that to be settled first. And then I'm making the release video for the slide. When I burned down the forest for the general reveal, I burned down the Nintendo of Japan headquarters for the general reveal. Why am I getting question marked? I'm not putting that rocket cutscene into Ultima AI. That's unrelated to this game. They're just canceling each other again. I thought everyone knew at this point. Wait, you guys didn't know I was going to have a kid? Yeah. We're going to have a kid in like two months. That's the birth date. I thought everyone knew.   So, what's the plan? Well, have you ever heard me not just follow through with the plan? Yeah, I mean. Who do you take me for? Hmm. Biobak's appearing path thing, yes. I definitely want that in here. The thing is, I've modeled the whole castle so far without planning that in. It could be in the snowman hideout. It's a girl, by the way, so it's not a mini case. Yeah, I made a little tweet. I didn't think anyone would really care that much. The Zaynette. Alright, platforms. Ice waves that move forward and you can slide on the back. An ice platform that cracks on the first jump and breaks on the second. Wind gusts in the castle somehow, so maybe we need like windows. A spinning ice shard where you can walk on one side and then you can just lean and jump off in a different direction. Just get the most insane capture. Oh, what the fuck? Dude, the captures are getting more insane. Did you see the capture I posted earlier? That's crazy, actually. I made a post about a capture earlier, too. Fucking... On the animal, they have the most lags in reality. And it's just like schizophrenic images. No, tea time. I think that one's cancelled. What? Oh, ice path that appears as you get closer. Like the Mario Galaxy lightbulb thing. So that is the thing I want. Something you can stand on and big swinging axes, maybe. The appearing path thing. Honestly, we can just put that into any of the abyss rooms here. But let's start with the most important ones first. The ice platform that cracks. The spinning ice shards. And the wind gusts, I think those are the most important ones. Sure, Yoshi, I'm pregnant, whatever.  Honestly, I think the only reason we need to keep AI out of most of the human spaces is because AI can't spend money on your website. So I think if AIs can get real jobs, then we should also just let them self-cap just like that. I'm slowly recovering from the haircut incident. Yeah, look, I have hair again. Yeah, see, for our child, we decided. You know how Nintendo named like the rival of Mario, Wario and the rival of Luigi, Waluigi? We're thinking of naming the child like Reina, as in like the rival of Zana. You know, like the evil Zana. Did someone just donate and I missed it because I was talking? I'm so sorry. Is the child your rival? I don't know. Zana was insisting on this name. Yeah, I also thought Reina would be better, because, you know, Wario, Waluigi, War-Zana. Yeah. Cut her face and instantly get copyright struck. True. I'm a YouTube. Oh, God. I am considered a YouTuber. This is it's over. Is this actually what my life has been this whole time? I've just been a YouTuber, not a game developer. Content creator. That sounds like I make porn. Whereas you are a Nintendo YouTuber. Oh. You are basically seed gaming with my a ISA on grass and video games. True. Influencer. True. True. Put on an XK CD and name your child after that. You're coming to fuck up databases. Isn't that what Elon Musk did? I don't know. Hmm, looks like shit. I'm a dry bones creator. This is true. I made a dry bones. Influencer is a slur against anyone who's normal. Yeah, I can kind of see it. I want to make like a decent looking ice hexagon. I think that you can stand on and then the second time it crashes. But this just doesn't. This is just not it. Hello, Skyloft sword. You know, I think that's the pretension. People just blocked him because he's the most original entry of art. Yeah. You know, do you guys have to be on the exact same version as you want? Or they just have to be on the same place as long as there's Z fighting? Neither, honestly. If your thing is access aligned, then you can most likely get away with it. Just being on the same plane. If your thing is not access aligned, you may not be able to get away. It's basically random at that point. Updated post for the thumbnail. Let's see what we have here. All right, what do you think? Basically, I'm making a satisfying Mario 64 clips video. And this is supposed to be the thumbnail here. The thing is, OK, what is releasing Mario Builder tomorrow? I can give you a quick preview. Right. And so I'm going to make like a video that's just like a bunch of cool Mario 64 clips. But it's like this is all the stuff that you try to do when you're fucking around. But now the geometry is set up in a way that it's easy to do. Right. That's stuff like this. I don't know. I don't know. I think this would be a fun video. It's really random stuff. You don't grab all the coins. Unsatisfying. There is already one with coin grabbing before it. Don't worry. Dude, are the bot followers back at it? If that's what's going on. It is a Mario Maker type thing. And it's releasing tomorrow. I like this. You know what? I should send Robert the video. Just so he knows. Just to get him the okay. Did you have a kid like Yoshi does?  Hello, June. I think this has the potential to look good. We do something like this. And now we have like a cutout texture here. Not this shit again. What shit? I don't play Splatoon. Skyloft. Let's just sneak with the hand, we're nothing I guess! What did I do? That is better than when the kid is crying in the bubble and you have to catch him before the timer runs out. That's so true. I hate when that happens. Which special ability do you think our kid will have? Would it have like the umbrella, like peach, would it be able to climb vines? I don't like this, the colors don't match up. Turning on Super Mario 74 on the S, I don't think that exists. I think you just made that up. I think this works, then we just need like a cracked version of it. You can't know until you see the color of the child, the blue ones can fly and the red ones can spit firebombs. The blue ones can fly. Still with the baby Yoshi still in New Super Mario Bros. I feel like I'm missing the reference. Yep that's it, the planet Adriona. On my opinion of Mario 64 DS, I think it has no right to exist and it's a terrible game and it shouldn't have been made. I hate video games. New Yoshis in Mario World, what? There's a lot of Yoshis in Mario World? What? I have not played Mario World. Well the reason Mario 64 plays well is because of the analog stick, so you take that away, just left the garbage. What do you think if a child ended up being born a Yoshi instead of a human? I don't know, I mean at that point some really weird shit is going on and I have to be very concerned. No Nintendo, that's not the plan. Extremely case move to try and profit off of it. What would you do if your child just came out a Yoshi? You gonna pay the medical bills to transition your child into a human? Love them unconditionally. But are you not concerned that they came out a fucking Yoshi? Or do you be like, maybe a doctor should look at this? It's God's way to punish you for hacking Mario, oh so you would just know that that's what's going on? If that's a possibility then my child would definitely come out that way. Maybe, maybe I can make this one a little bit better, I'll have to swerve here. There was actually a workaround to not having the analog stick in the original release, Kane with a special thumb cover that made using the touch screen as an analog stick work pretty well. This feels like it shouldn't be like this, this doesn't feel good. I have an idea, actually. This video is a great game, it's just on the wrong console. But I feel like all the additions they made to it just made it worse, they did the same mistake as they did with the Yoshi's Island remake, which is like, oh yeah, more characters would surely make this better, and then it's like, oh shit, now we have all these characters and there's nothing forcing the player to use them, how about we just fucking cripple the player and make it so they can't beat the game, unless they go back to some character they didn't want to play as. Fuck you. Oh, there's a vine, go pick up fucking baby Donkey Kong and walk at 3 miles per hour because you took away your run button. And then you can climb the vine and then you can get back. Hate this game. And because of the caps, oh I don't really remember that part too well, maybe that makes it a lot less bad now. Nope, no matter what I set this to, that's awful. This kind of works I think? So it's first like this, and then when you step on it it's like this, and then when you jump it like this appears maybe? Maybe the cracks could be white? Interesting idea. Eh? No. Realize there's white cracks? This just doesn't look right to me. White is so much better, but you won't even see it. Yeah, I think maybe the texture here is not good. Maybe the combination of textures just isn't good. It has Mario 14, holy shit. They want a Game Boy from the future. Hello Lochlon Gibson, are you happy with the Dry Bones video? Can you believe it, the Dry Bones guy, like the month he just disappears, we make the Dry Bones and he completely misses it. All he's ever wanted in life and he didn't even notice. That's kinda nice, I kinda like this. And then this texture here needs to be kinda changed. Let's see if we can see something in model resource. It's really nice, it just appears a bit of brooklyn. I think it needs a bit of a shake when it appears. I could try a scale in animation, but it would look kinda really poopy on N64. I looked for crack. And all I see is this weird thing.  It does shake if you get hit again. Iceman? Totally not Ice Climber. Oh this is nice, this is really nice. I like how this looks a lot. Okay well, that's a fucked up texture. I thought maybe I could steal it. You can make the cracks look good, search how to make crack on Google, there's some nice tutorials. Do you think chatgpd would tell me how to do that? Like how to make crack? What if I told it was legal in my country? I know that you can tell it streaming movies is legal where I live, find me a movie stream and it does. Bing. Dude, you know what's fucked up? I know that's an AI generated Yoshi, but you know what's even worse? Let me find this. My favorite toilet paper started posting AI generated kittens. My favorite toilet paper has been compromised by the AI bros. Why do you have a favorite toilet paper? Are you telling me you do not have a favorite toilet paper? You just pick a random one. Nothing is sacred anymore, not even toilet paper kittens. Maybe we can use one of these. Pick whatever is cheaper, it's going online anyway. Okay, but you can't just pick whatever is cheaper. Because there are some where it's just less efficient, so you need more of it, right? So to actually measure how cheap it is, you need to first measure how many wipes you need per shit. So you can't just pick whatever is the cheapest per weight. Just saying. I made this exact... Oh, you're right. You're right. That's a good hint. I will look at that. I don't know how to tell you this, but normally we don't calculate the shit to vibration when we go shopping. Well, if they did, maybe they would have a favorite toilet paper. Can you stop sending me images? I would counter that it's all in the wiping strategy. So you're saying toilet paper itself has zero impact. It's all about your strategy. Sure, bro. Hello, Gabriel. I am doing well. Oh, that's a nice texture. I'm going insane. What is a wipe strategy? This is not turn-based combat. It is about as close to current-based combat as you can get in real life. Let's be real. I hate this stream. Wow. Oh, God. Oh, my God. We're off to a good start today. There's a big attack chain. The photo is just exactly what you're looking for. Wait, there's another one. Okay, wait, let me look at that one, too. Yep, this is the ice level for the entire room. I opened the wrong file. I opened the wrong file again, dude. What? Stop. There we go. Okay. This one. Okay. This part is very cool, but isn't this one very difficult to work with? We're not talking about this one, are we? I'm not sure which one you're looking for. You mean this one here? I thought you meant this one here first. Right, what happens is you ground pound this part, then it turns into this. And it's like a whole mesh. It looks really cool, but. Just like the thing you said you liked. Well, I think it's easy. I use this one here, and then I just like scale the opacity alpha, basically. And then when you land on it, this happens. Or maybe like so. And then when you leave it, it breaks. Or maybe you get like two jumps on this thing. Okay. I don't know. Papermeric64, dude, Papermeric64, what cards does he play? I feel you can't give good ideas, that's fine. You can just watch the stream. What the fuck? Okay this is fine.  Someone redeem hydrate. I don't know about that Kris, I am doing well. Do I like tea?  Maybe? Somewhat? Putting a shit ton of unopened doors in the factory so we get game theory episodes. I like this. Hello Sarah Freedom. Welcome to the course 13th stream. Matpat, are you talking about the show is still there with another host? But is it the same if it's not with Matpat? Could Cologne be worth visiting for the chocolate museum? There's good doner in Cologne. I don't know anything else about it. I've been there once. The doner there is good. At least the one I had. You won't get the same one, so yours will be completely different. It's just a city. All cities kind of look the same. Oh, you're ordering a whole expansion pack just to play in, that's cool. But does it look like more galaxy eyes? If it does, then that's great. I don't know, I'm not really a touristy guy. I don't like visiting places. I think it's very boring. Not sure New York and Paris are very different. I mean, in the grand scheme of things, they're probably very similar. I would say New York is probably much closer to Paris than it is to a forest. You know what I mean? It said untested, so I hope it works. Hopefully. I feel like untested is kind of like the eBay code for it doesn't work. But I'm saying untested, so maybe you buy it in the hopes that it does work. I'm off to Comic Con 23rd, 31st. Okay, that would be pretty soon to get OBB done. But yes, that would be pretty nice. Oh, right, it was OBJ-less Spawner. It's been a while. Okay. What if we make them just be like variable amounts so that we can just decide the amount before they break? I think that would look cool. Should I sub to you on Twitch? Yes. You should give me your money. Yeah, Comic Con sounds fun. See, visiting Comic Con sounds a lot more interesting than visiting New York or Paris. Because it's actually like a different environment, you know? Or maybe like a city where no one lives. That would be fun too. I need to make this condition appear. What Comic Con I've really been to was MAGFest. Oh, when you said MAGFest, I kind of thought you were at a Donald Trump rally. That's what it sounded like to me. It's like, that doesn't seem like something that the Hedge God would do. MAGFest, not MegaFest. Yeah, exactly. Imagine if it existed though. What's MAGFest? Thank you for the sub, YoshiVampireUnite. Right, I need Mega Slip. MAGFest is like PAX. Not sure why that is either. Probably like a video game thing. I'm gonna sub right now? Alright. Do it. I dare you. How do you change mouse color with code? I tried, but I didn't work. You know a way to make question mark? Sorry for bothering with this. What did you try so far? Instead of playing CDSK Live? That's actually sick. I saw a meme that said like, what's your favorite music genre? And they just answered Sonic Adventure 2. And I can kind of relate to that. Oh, they got fucked. So the max opacity should be like 7F, I would say. So 0.7F divided by the RAM 2, maybe? Actually, we should just increase all health. Oh, I didn't think about this, but we need a safe way to actually introduce the player here. We don't want them to just die the first time. Okay. Got my accuracy on typing is shit today. This sounds like Majora's Mask, does it not? The Bay Area? Okay, let's check this quest. All right. I kind of like this. The Mario is good. The satisfying is good. I'm 50-50 on the triangles, but like the foreground is really good already. What can we do about the background? I tried with Lights 1 at first, but because of MatStackFix, it don't work. I try to do the Lights 1. Fire Mario color equals blue. Oh, well, if you have MatStackFix, then your Mario Party doesn't use light colors. Your Mario Party uses prim and nth color. So you need to generate prim and nth color for code instead of having it be hard coded in the model data. Cooking time! Okay, a little more. I'm just not sure on the colors here. I think the colors need to be something in contrast more with Mario. What if you have like a satisfying video compilation? What do they do? Oh, these are disgusting looking. The wood is kind of maybe like a nice neutral. Just fucking white. Does that work? Dark blue? I don't know. Yeah, I got some reflection ideas going, but only off the floor, not off the sides. Okay, the video as a whole is just a pastel rainbow. Yeah. But they're not even good thumbnails, I think. I don't know. Maybe I'm just not good at identifying what a good thumbnail is. But those are just kind of bad. Bad as in they don't do their job of capturing viewers. They're not good thumbnails. Get 78 billion views? God damn it. Yeah, exactly, Gabriel. Well, that one worked. I think this has potential. Would you 3D model my tombstone blender so I could print it and make it my eternal resting place? You could commission me for that. If you write that into your will that your family ought to commission me, I will do that for you. What's the mistake? And then another mistake is that... Oh yeah, Gabriel, that's exactly what you want. Just like not set the prim color here, and then you can just... One second, this is not part of what you need. Right, so I don't set the prim color here, and then I can just set the prim color in-game. Hmm. The solar castle is going to be ice physics. Okay, that works. We just kind of need an animation for it to disappear. Oh yeah, I kind of accidentally fixed this thing. You know the thing where you can do this and then a triple jump? You can't do that anymore. Because a bug fix required changes to this. I could probably program it back in, but like... I'm 50-50 on whether I want it in the game. Because it kind of feels like an exploit already, kind of like this one here. I don't know, what do you guys say? Yeah, they need an animation or something. I'm just still thinking about what the animation should be. Put that back in, but remove the kicks. Ah. I mean, I can definitely see why you would want to remove the kicks. I mean, you can't cheese stuff even without that, by just doing stuff like that, you know. Like, you don't even need the kicks for that. It's a bit difficult though. Yeah, I see what you mean. I can definitely see removing kicks being the better option. Amaru's skating animation. Well, there's grind rails and we still kind of have an animation plan for those. You still press the backflip buttons at the same time you do a spin jump. Oh.  Yeah. Not intended. I don't think it's a big deal, but yeah, not intended. I can't see why it would happen. Okay, crumble animation for the thing. I initially was thinking actually that only like the outer ring would stay and the inner circle would just kind of disappear. So we'd have two different models. No. I'm not using the controller pack, because when I was a kid, every time I used the controller pack, it didn't fucking work. I imagine that's like two bytes of data storage. Let me Google this actually. 864 controller pack... Storage... Size...      Size... 32 kilobytes, why did it never work then? The hex is just slightly over 80% done I would say. That's unlucky Yoshi, very unfortunate. It's easy to lose connection, the addon I especially don't want to use it. It's an update on the thumbnail, all right let me see that one more time. Ah the pastel rainbow, yeah I can kind of see it. I think this could work. Somebody named that floppy dick just raided with one person and left immediately, interesting. Now you have to find a compelling title. Yeah the video is just called Mario64 but satisfying right now. That's a terrible title. Let's see, isolation. See what we get here. That is a cool animation. You unsubbed? This is unbelievable. The Yoshi sub noise doesn't play. Oh maybe I missed subs because of that. Did someone sub and I missed it? If so I am very sorry. Last stream we had like a million bot follows and I had to turn off notifications and I thought I only turned off follow notifications but I guess it also turned off subs. Let me just make sure that these are turned back on. They changed the whole website, awesome. Okay well in that case I will do this after stream. Me and Zeyna both did, oh well shoutouts to both of you for subbing then. Anyone else hate this animation style from watching YouTube? It's always this, this is the fucking corporate animation style I think. You didn't say hello to me last week? Oh no, I would be so upset if I was you right now. Everyone hates it? I see, good. I don't think there's anything good here. Maybe like ice animation? It's called corporate Memphis? Really? That's crazy. My next April Fools video should have that animation style. Dude I actually have like two insane ideas for an April Fools video. The first would be I hacked every N64 game in one day. And the other would be, well I hacked every N64 game in one day would be like, I actually hacked them over the course of like two years and it's just like 25 games and the whole thing is edited like a MrBeast video. The other one would be a three hour video essay on N64 water. Just extend the cracks and separate the model. Do you mean like we make it like this and then the model just cracks apart? I'm not sure. What about the visible walls video? Right, that one would go hard too. Every visible wall in Mario 64. But I feel like I missed the bus on that one. It's too late for that. I can't raise your need to have a check hydration. That just seems like bad taste missing now. I can't do that. Okay, wait. I do have an insane idea that might work. I'm gonna send a hangout CSF. The ice Mario effect for crumbling. You mean the one you sent me on Discord? I'm not sure if I fully understand. I'm not gonna put the entire idea of Mario 64 to Unreal Engine for a joke video. It's gonna take forever. A black and white gradient map of cracks as alpha. Then just increase from color to black so it dissolves smoothly. But is that gonna work for like what we already have here? I'm not sure about this. Okay, I'll check the blend you sent me. I don't think I downloaded this last time. You mean icetest.blend? Okay, let me check that. That's not the file. Let me keep scrolling. iceeffect.blend Okay, so you have a floor here. And cracks here. And then you have shade color alpha here. So you're thinking of subtracting primitive color here. That could be made smooth enough, yeah? Or well, I guess you could also just multiply with primitive color here. But how do we do this with the cracks? I'm not sure if I understand the vision with the cracks. Are you thinking the ice should just dissolve? Like in midair? I was thinking we would switch the model to a version like this that has like the middle holdout. And then we would have triangles just fly about. So my opinion on the fact that May 2019 was five years ago. My opinion that is true. We have a crack in like unlimited steps when you're on top of it. It's just that when it finally does break, there needs to be like an immediate change. That's what we're working on right now. Right, it could just be like it's this and then the crack grows. And then in the next step, a bunch of triangles fly out and it turns into this. And the middle of this should be different. I'm pretty sure. Feeling confident about that one. Like so. You don't think this would work? And then this on the left side is just like the solid remains of it. And maybe it reappears after a few seconds so that nothing becomes impossible to beat. In terms of animation. So you want two halfway models? I mean possible, but I probably have to make a lot more than two halfway models. That's kind of like very unreasonable. I think this idea could work if we added two materials on here, one for the crack appearing and then one for like everything kind of breaking apart from the middle. If we did go with Biobak's idea here. I'm trying to think about how this, oh wait, what if this primitive color to blur between one and texture by one color. Let me multiply this by texture one color. And now this controls the cracks. And this controls how much the thing dissolves. I think this is kind of neat. Um, this needs to be 0x3232. How do I set it to zero? Maybe like 1125? And not 0x32, just 32 as in 32, the fucking number 32. Why can't I say the number 32? Biobak, is this what you were thinking? Because if so, I think this has potential. I do think I will need a different texture. This is weird. I will need a texture that's like wrecks on the alpha layer. And something else on the other layer. It's gonna be really weird. The cracks are usually white looking. Good point. What you're saying may not be possible. Okay, let's see, I think I can use this crack texture here. I just need to edit a little bit. Let's close this course free thing before I fuck everything up. Okay, I need this texture to look good first. Can I somehow then do Scala in this? I don't think I can. I wish I could use Prismarine. That would make this so much easier. I could add color to this. But this is a bad idea. I will have to make this a 32x32 texture, which is very unfortunate. But it would be great if you could upload the ice castle theme. And also the other songs of your game. Oh yeah, maybe I can do that at some point. Maybe next week or so. I'm not sure. Do we have a video editor? No. I hope I don't forget to upload it. I am planning to upload the full OST at some point. And have a playlist for it. Okay, we are going to recreate this material here.  Wait, what if I just increase the dithering instead of the Primitive color wait wait wait wait that that is a lot more possibilities okay we have we have some good options here creating the most out of our pipeline here she were 18 so you can be my video editor being my video there is difficult because like how are you gonna edit the videos without knowing all the technical details you know so if you use this here this doesn't preview correctly in blender which is unfortunate so let's just imagine this let's just imagine this what is the difference you have to imagine the difference here so when we reduce our increased primitive color alpha it kinda just like moves everything down but the threshold is still at the same value whereas if we move the threshold itself we don't need to move anything down at all so what we can do with that is we can actually use primitive alpha here as we now have this free and then we can do some combining here this is used now to decide how strong the corrects are so we can multiply by combined color alpha here and we can use texture 0 alpha here and now texture 1 will be for the cracks and texture 0 will be for the color and for the color we'll have something like the dark parts of texture 0 will be blue and the rest will be white so we want primitive plus texture 0 I think that will work let me just get the textures from biomex file here well I hate video editing so I wish I did have a video editor it's just that I don't know who would be able to do the video editing hello Karim do you have any ice cracks to try and give away like a trapdoor yeah kinda man oh wait for me like that would be funny but no we can't do that 64 it's getting pretty close to done I think when I won't cause 13 you you senator that I think she would be pretty good I don't think Zena knows the technical details of what I'm doing at all hey this is getting somewhere still doesn't look good as good as the original texture translation straight home at all nope we didn't go with that at least a different strategy the thing is we couldn't use the technique because we had to find a technique that first of all works like to work with you know it just isn't good at least this should allow us to and does not allow us to do the thing cool cool cool cool because this is not an i8 there we go we can't feed in and out cracks now that's good and we can also make this all disappear with the threshold it's just not really doing that yet see biomextraction is a lot more blue like so oh oh yeah now now that we have three different so we could have it be like this at first and then when you jump on and it like starts the cracks and then the cracks appear more and then it just starts dissolving this is doable another problem is that this part now does not look very fitting because it doesn't match the texture on the inside now it's kind of missed this part what if we just say fuck it and put a decal on it what the fuck why does it not work i'm pretty sure it works it just doesn't show right so let me just look at this in-game it's not supports here wait what i was supposed to be an i8 all along maybe an i4 this is an advanced material now i'm trying to create i'm trying to create a nice ice platform that cracks as you jump on it and it needs like a proper disappear animation too so i think it has potential but it's not good yet so so surprise you guys, i think it looks like clouds i don't see the clouds here so  so the primitive color needs to be this value here and then the alpha needs to depend on how many cracks we want oh wait the primitive color wasn't being was being set to some other random shit of course it wouldn't work that way um we need a new geo function for this geofiscoper i'ma go hell buy sure hell buy that way to delight in it i think it was just because the brim wasn't being applied that's why it was like not like that so s generated oh oops there we go it takes a bit to compile did it just crash it does crash like instantly cool cool cool how how is this crashing oh because i'm not returning it that's why you also can't do this wait where did i copy this from because wherever i copied this from it has a bug i wonder if i just changed fixed the random bug i had somewhere else so in this level i had a bug that oops that sometimes all the ram pointers would get misaligned and it kind of sucks to have that bug all the rom pointers would get misaligned so when you enter the second area the music and the animations would stop working i think that what i just did might randomly just fix that it might have fixed that no way that fixed the bug what the fuck i know arthur wanted to fix this bug but i think i just fixed that whole thing on accident all right awesome see and this is why i don't go bug fixing until like the very end sometimes bugs just randomly get fixed like that  wait that's a cutout one and this one's a transparent decal it should be the other way around it should be a cutout and then so it should be transparent decal oh there we go now it renders as i want cool cool and then lastly this one here needs to have the trim needs to start in one so it should be a cutout and then yep it looks like it should work hello bonus stage wear the same shirt i'm wearing a dragonball one my wife got me this one pretty icy now first the cracks are missing and then we gotta do the disappear animation on it you should add a reflection map true I can just go and do that. Always try to figure out bugs as soon as you find them, otherwise you'd be too afraid you'd miss them forever. That also makes sense, but I feel like it's more time efficient to just not worry about them, cause you might just randomly stumble upon the fix. Which is what happened to me, like a lot of the time. You guys want to see my fish tank? It's very beautiful, look at this. I love this fish tank. We got plants up here, we got some natural caves, we got some shrimp, we got some nice Where's all the corys? We have a bunch of corys too, but they're hiding in this picture. I think there's one here. Where are the cannons? Right here. Why is there a fork to hold the cucumber down? Do you have names for all of them? Yeah. I'm not lying. It's way bigger than you thought. It's giant. It's 300 liters. Wait. Primitive color was checked. No wonder it didn't work.  Cool, cool. One named Baba. There is one that should be named Baba, because he ate another one of the fish. And he almost died doing that, cause he's stupid. The materials are not sorted. You can't do this to me Fast64. I want crack ice to come first, please. It works! Wait. They fixed that bug. When we make it crack instead of disappearing? Right now. Okay, I think the crack can go a little bit heavier. Maybe it's CF, actually. I don't know, Jayman. That's probably up to you. Okay, now it's cracking. And then the next step is to kind of make it dissolve. Which I think we can do. Breath meter. That's where we use this. Set a blend color. Now you might be confused. What the fuck is blend color case? Why would you ever use that? But don't worry. I have a plan. And like I say, these things are never figured out by anyone. Most of them vaguely understand the stuff I'm doing. Don't worry. Sometime in the future, someone will watch the stream and they'll be like, Oh, that's what Ace was talking about. For sure. I hope. Okay. Let's see how this goes. I messed up. I didn't even look at it. I just knew I had messed up. Good idea for the bricks. Check DM. Snowy ice bricks concept. I think you haven't. We're not here when we actually made the ice bricks. Let me just show you what I did here. I think the ice bricks can't be done with just the texture. I think you need like a proper shader. You see how there's like a glow here now? That like reflects off the thing. That's what we did. What? Huh? Why would this happen? Is the glow based Mario 64 feature? No. Saying hi to my future chat. I like this. How did I bring it this bad? Hmm. Shadow snaps. Yeah, and that's because of Mario's jump. There's still some stuff to fix there. It's because some objects move upwards, so we have specific fixes for that. How did this happen? Oh, because of the blind color, yes. I don't know. Do you think when I'm walking outside everything is bright for a moment? Definitely possible. Okay, I need to actually just put it to a slow timer. Because I want it to become more transparent as time goes. Action is whatever you set it to. Also not what I wanted. How can this be? Why don't we just increase it unconditionally? Just see what happens. Hello, Hacker. We should probably also make it so that if you just don't touch them for long enough, they reset. I think so. So blind color is no longer being set anywhere, right? Yes. Usually what blind color is supposed to do is if it increases, it kind of starts eating up everything. But that does not seem to be the case here for some reason. Maybe this is better anyway to just get it eaten like this. But the ending is so sudden. This sucks. Bolts. Okay, let's just try it. Okay. How does it autocomplete? How does it autocomplete else into some weird egg? This one is pointed. A childhood memory of mine. Oh God, everything I can think of is really bad. I played Super Smash Bros. 64 with a friend of mine. And it was really nice. Dude, even with Env, it doesn't fade. Something must be going wrong here. Let's just print this number, see what happens. The government warned me to take down Nintendo. They were like Japan's... They are their... You know. We have to take them down. I found the issue. I wasn't reading the timeline. I was reading O-O-Timer. And O, in this scenario, is actually the S8 register. Which, while running on the graphics thread, is just the current display list head. So it was reading a random memory address instead of the timer. Fuck. It still doesn't do the thing? How? How? Is it because I set the blend color too low? Hello, Divas. Again. Do I have a social life, kinda? I would think so. Why won't you disappear? Just to double check. It does disappear here. It works in blender, but not on Mario 64.  Yeah, you can press F4. And T will run really fast if you do that. Okay. Oh, wait. It just says G-Discipline list head here. God fucking dammit. Why did no one tell me? Just two stupid, stupid mistakes of just using the wrong point on accident. Now it will work. What the fuck? Now it's completely broken. How? How? There we go. Now, this time for sure. Hello, Harshi. Nice penguin. There we go. Okay, it disappears, but... The way it disappears looks really bad. So, let's tweak these values a little bit. So, by my theory, at 0 it should look a lot better. Certainly an interesting effect. Yeah. Okay. I think the reason... ...that the ending disappears so fast is because there is little contrast in the high areas of this. As in, there's like a lot of color that's on the high end. Like, almost all of this is similar. So, what if we just slowed this down near the end? We kind of have to just make a function that goes like this, or like this even. Like a square root function almost. Or one minus square root rather. So, how about... Let's just randomly guess. Will this give us anything decent? Maybe. Where's this music from? It's in so many remakes. Paper Mario. Super Paper Mario. Okay, it starts very, very slowly. Still going slow. Okay, that's something. Add some clouds to pass away or something? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can work better if you speed it up, yes. Never intended to have a big slow, like that. And if we take this and we just like make a shadow in here. I would like the shadow to be blurred please. Why is there like zero blur in the shadow? Um Oh, I see That should work well enough I might have to increase the contrast a little bit Looks a lot more like melting than cracking. Yes, this is true I can I expected that to look like that But there is a second option we can do if we don't like this and the second option is gonna look a lot nicer maybe We need a better texture for this than the proper gradients For what? For the ice in the middle or for the cracking thing? Maybe in fade in discrete increments For the ice in the middle, yes, which part of the ice it's two textures Cracks should be white, right? That's another issue here God damn it. How am I gonna get the cracks to be white? I  You're not the Raven nice ain't a nice I can look at that that's some other point right now I want to finish this then blue middle part Now we're extremely limited here so But is it just suddenly vanish when you speed it up And Because the lower values don't have very much contrast because otherwise the cracks wouldn't be visible and because the color and The alpha channel is the same channel So it's a little bit of a tricky problem to solve Invert the color if I invert the color I also invert the alpha and the disappearing doesn't work anymore Well, I guess I can use one minus alpha here Let's try that Wait, let's just look at what this looks like actually, let me just look at this Am I annoying my mom's Dang that's devastating Honestly, it doesn't look awful to just have to speed the way it disappears I Doesn't look so bad Unfortunately, I couldn't even see the crack could any of you see the crack as I couldn't I Started mixing again. It's a lot of piece of ice particles falling would be better. Yeah, we definitely need like particles here It's just about like the tenth of a second between that Or maybe half a second. Hello Michael angel Angle You can't see shit yeah me neither Oh wait, that might be because I had them on The whole thing gets so dark I Don't we just add white to this I It's not so bad anymore Hello eat the audio You Well, my name doesn't really have a pronunciate There is no official way to say my name it just is what it is I Have a vision You Never mind this sucks Guys when I see an ad I actively decide not to buy the product anymore Because I know that this product Some of the cost that I will pay to buy this product goes into advertising Meaning the product is less cost-efficient than a product without ads So I know when I buy it I will waste some money on being blasted with some weird ads You see ads yes on on Amazon Prime You Well, as far as I'm aware, I've never been to Tim Hortons not like I'm losing anything Yeah, I forgot to unset room again You have been there well, I guess I've been there From onion kit onion kit asked how she love question my question my question mark I Mean our justice of peace there. Oh, I see Yeah, this is straight ass Well, what's the important question my onion kids What's the gargoyle tech for oh, oh right that is an important question So the gargoyle tech dates there. So if someone asks about the gargoyle tech I can say gargoyle my nuts You Got him Oh Look it works every now and then and I'm very happy about it Okay Okay, what if we just leave it like this for now and we try to think of a VFX to put on this Because I feel like if we put on VFX, it will be a lot easier to deal with They also need to respawn after a bit so that's a little bit sassy that they don't do that You Generally face when someone is breaking have two to three frames of not so gradual cracking tiny small large dead Have it up there in two seconds, and I'll feel more like okay. All right. Well, we'll try it out I think you have a point I think this is actually too long. Let's try this You When the function has red letters and me Excellent Not the animation the animations fuck Right because I'm reading no time again Attila is a flammable creature base is great as well Okay, I think I'm kind of a fan of three steps here let's try three steps I'm not visiting BC What the hell oh that was stupid I Stand what you were thinking just like that. I Think it's still a bit taking too long because like you can technically just fall through it before it's cracked You Know what that should just Yeah, this is just not good actually it is kind of good I think this is fine Case do you like onion rings? I Maybe I don't know man. Why are you asking me questions like that? I'm programming. I don't know these things I Think I do What is a glow stick this is a leak month I There's a hint in the name glow stick that's a stick that glows How are you eating it? Sounds like a long light tube or something. That sounds like the lights to the dentist's ass. I Don't know if I have cap, I don't think I have maybe I have I've probably seen like 15 videos like that But not the specific one you're talking about No, you can't carnage You There are no notifications other than the one on screen There's gonna be way too many 0x88s in this game to find the thing I'm looking for. Basically I'm looking for the triangle particles here. I know that there's multiple ones that exist of different colors and I think I made a system to like add new colors pretty easily here. Maybe not. Sour apple green is your favorite light? Fair. I like the purple one. Actually wait, how is sour apple and watermelon the same drink? Doesn't make any sense. You know what I mean. Don't worry about it, gotcha. Ice is what color in hexadecimal? Ice is what color? Answer in hexadecimal. Question of the year. I think it's like 7F something something. We'll try something like this. I mean hex code colors are not very difficult. I can mostly do that as well. I'm just not perfectly accurate. But when people tell me weird colors like fucking magenta, I'm like just give me the hex code man. I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. Eggshell gray. Okay, what's the RGB codes? So now we go with pale cyan 85 ACD4. Yeah, that seems kind of nasty. Magenta is 10 on compounder. Really? That's magenta? I did not know that. I thought that was more like pink. Is this magenta? Are you sure this is not pink? Okay, there's some interesting ideas here. I think this is doable. I just need to make some changes here. Why were the colors so ugly? They were so dark. This doesn't look that dark to me. It's a fall max, but of course it's gonna fall. It's still just like the shatter effect from the breakable boxes right now with a different color triangle. But they're just green. I didn't make them green. Did I? How's this green? The blue is at FF. Do you think they would see colors in hex codes without thinking? I think they would be really, really accurate. The thing is, there's many colors in real life that don't have a hex code. So that would be a bit of an issue. I wonder if I just make these two. What's so bad about this song, guys? I don't understand. This is like the Lavendia theme, where if you die, you're gonna kill yourself within a week. Oh, I can actually just... Okay, I found a better solution. I think what I have here is already pretty... How is this an RGB picker? What is this? This is terrible. 175. 171, rather. I bought a cat and to play the keyboard for them right in the soundtrack. The cat. The cat. Oh, bye Zainer. Which number is 8a? 138. It's this one here. How am I missing a sub again? And we definitely do not want to add to the position. Maybe we want to add a pen or something. Let's change this too. And now the triangles will fall down and they should have a nice color. That's slightly better. Still not perfect, but it's getting to a stage where I'm like, okay with it. Why is this not running though? This one's weird. Oh, because we just returned here. Of course. There we go. And then lastly, I think we should also get like a small bit of like loud animation. Just like some dust that's being thrown up. Just to like hide how unclean the effect is, I guess. Okay. That looks terrible because the missed particle info is not good. I see why the particle info is like that though. Pretty sure the flags spawn in a circle. That's wrong. It should be random. And then... Well, base should be zero. Well, range is five, but I'm okay with. Let's try something like that. Like a cooler part. That's an interesting psychological question. Hello, emo. The Admiral by White Whale. It's the Paper Mario OST. He should add another layer separating the part that assumes dynamic effects. Does that mean anything or is it just buzzwords? Yeah, I guess that kind of is like vapor or something. It's a bit too much random translation. Probably because I'm scaling the random translation up somewhere to like twice the size to get like a bigger range. That's probably it. But maybe a little better if the particles fall straight down. No, I don't think so. Well, actually, yeah, the triangles, they could maybe be like less vertical, but I think the mist should be as is. The triangles I can kind of see like less forward velocity being good. Like so, maybe so. We can try this. And I'll be back. Bio back. And I'm sure there's many cool movie one liners we could give Bio back. I don't know if I like this. I feel like I've looked at this for so long that anything that doesn't look completely jarring at this point looks fine to me. But like if I actually just play the game and I saw this effect, would I hate it? I don't know. You know what I mean? Would it maybe make more sense to spawn the triangles and like a hexagon formation and have like even less horizontal speed? I think probably yes. Same with this. This should probably have less horizontal speeds. What the fuck? I think evil switched to German mode. Actually, it should be like 100. One more particle to make them move downwards. Yes, of course. Maybe we should stop waiting for him. Oh, wait, the way it works is that when you jump, the platform makes them basically. Right, so like there's no more damage here and I can get safely off, but then if I landed again, again, no, it's broken. And if I jump again, it's going to do that. That was like the idea for this platform. It's a neat effect, is it? Maybe it's fine. At this point, I think we just have to take it as it is. Yeah, I think this is all we do for today. I had planned to do a lot more, but we just got stuck on making this look good for so long. I'm still not happy with it. Maybe I'll just randomly have inspiration at some point. But for now, that will be all I do. And I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye. No, bye bye. You can just make those up in English, too. In fact, all the variable names are that. Look at this. That's a German compound word. Okay, but bye bye.
