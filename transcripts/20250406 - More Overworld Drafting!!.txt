Hello, Nintendo for life. Hello, Deadads. Hello, King Dededelicious. Hello, Selton. Hello, Mimosky. You got any OST wishes today? Also, I have possibly the craziest optimization ever. And if this is true, then this would be funny. Basically, it looks like the temperature of your Nintendo 64 affects how well it runs. So we might have to do optimizations that make the N64 run not as hot. And I think that would be really funny. But I'm still yet to see the data, so... I don't know. I don't know why. Eh. Nah. I want something more familiar today. Wrong start level. No, overheating is not a worry. It's just that it looks like the N64 may get like 0.1% slower when it's warm. Like if I let my N64 run for 3 hours, it gets ever so slightly slower. So just saving a couple microseconds that way would be hilarious. It does not have issues with that. Saying it's an issue is already over-exaggerating. The most accurate thing to say is that it exists. Like... Imagine you are a sprinter and you have hair. Then cutting off your hair to reduce wind drag would be about as big an optimization as fixing the heat. OT? OT sounds good. Nice, it's a nice car. Thank you. Man, today's video got a lot more negative reception than I thought it would get. I thought people would really like it. But so far people have been hating it. Hello Buzzard. Hello Sarah, you have autism. I know. This level feels a little long for what it does. Although I guess the bone dragon would be really cool. The video is really long. I mean it has to be long. This is going to be the overworld. Shade-aiding philistines. Similar to Lucky 2 Camp. Could you specify what classifies as similar to Lucky 2 Camp? The way I see it, they do have a very similar camera system to that. Hello Tania Inocente Hermosa Uvu. Tania... Nevermind. I had a stupid question. I love the idle animation. For the new Mario? Wedges that it snaps to, auto movement, it's losing areas in the level, stuff like that. Okay, so the incremental thing, I think there's an advantage to it, especially in fast-paced games. But I also see how most people would be tripped up by that. I think there is value in having it, but it should not be the default for everything. The automatic rotation it does is already pretty common in games, I think. Although I usually hate it. When are you going to start development streaming again? I stream still once or twice a week. What is meant to be Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64 style? Neither. It's just supposed to be Yoshi's Island. Are you into the Minecraft movie? No, I've never been a Minecraft fan. And the movie is mostly dogshit, so... I don't know when the shift happens, but when I was an adolescent... Minecraft was like the cool thing to hate. And now people love it. I wonder if the same is going to happen with Fortnite. My people right now kind of meme on Fortnite, but then in 10 years they're going to love it. And they'll be like, oh man, I wish games were still good. Like, you remember Fortnite? Oh my god. Why is Project XR in your taskbar? Isn't that unsafe? It's only unsafe if you run viruses. Just don't run a virus and you're fine. What are the most popular games? I'm not sure if it's for all popular games, but definitely for games that children like. Hello, Zelda. Yo, yo, case. Yo, yo, yo, Mr. Case. You rapping at me? And I don't know what it is. Before starting the stream, I felt so positive about streaming. And now I'm already mentally exhausted. I have no idea what you're talking about. There's no problem. I'll take that as a no. What was the question? Did you ask me if I went to the Minecraft movie? The answer is no. Drinks don't reach yet. You might just be right about that. All right, we're going to do part 13. Sandy in the north, mountains in the south. There's an area here where it always rains. I think it will be cool. Pirate Krause nest, summer stuck in the sand. Some houses were built to build. Okay, this overworld is going to bring everything together. So this is going to be a very difficult overworld to make. Oh shit, something's happening. That was so delayed. There's no way it's like that in the game. I might have missed your question then. That does not happen sometimes. Bangalore is here. Someone bit the cats too. Crazy. Do you ever make a Mario game in the world? I keep side-scrolling. I mean, given infinite time, maybe. But I think there's things I could make with my time that are going to be a lot more popular. Yeah, I missed your question. Mischief Maker is not that popular. I mean, I'm going to be honest. Personally, I don't have much of a connection to Mischief Makers either. So the only reason I would make a Mischief Makers game like that is if I did expect it to be super popular. Or if I was commissioned to make it, but that seems unlikely. Okay. Why is my mouse cursor wrong? That was weird. What's the secret to your success with the opposite gender? Shit. I don't know, man. Just be yourself. The concept of being successful with the opposite gender is so foreign to me that it's difficult to put into words how I think about it. It's like, what the hell? I don't know. If you don't try to get a girlfriend, you won't get one. That's the type of advice that fucking Elliot Rocha had to hear. But I think normal people do try. Yeah, if you're too scared to even try, obviously that's not going to work. What the fuck? Kind of a no-brainer now. But I feel like normal people that want to have success with women, they do try. I don't know. Just be yourself, but only after going to the gym. Hey! Yeah, just be yourself. Unless you're skinny, then be literally anyone but yourself. What are these questions? Huh? Where is this coming from? What does it even mean? I'm getting tilted by chat. That one guy that said not to read chat was right. Okay. Toadstool is not a modeling tool. Toadstool is a thing that you can use to move hectares around. That being said, Toadstool is from the 2017 era. It's been outdated since then. I've been using ROM Manager since 2018. And there's also Quad64, which replaces Toadstool. There really is no reason to use Toadstool. It is closed source and has a bunch of bugs that are really annoying to work with. So you can't even fix those bugs. Do you have any ideas to make the connection paths more interesting? No, unfortunately. Okay. Okay. Okay. Which makes World of Warcraft one of the big water-overworld islands that you can go to. Honestly, I almost had an idea for a game like that. It was called... I actually think I named it like Mario's Odyssey back then. This was before Odyssey released. And it was like a gigantic open world where you could go to different islands. And hexagon mushrooms. They might have had more polygons, but they looked kind of poopy. Okay, let me think about this. Hmm. The problem is that this makes the mountainous region look so small. And I don't want that. I want this to just disappear into forest. How do I make it disappear into forest? Multiple layers of forest maybe? Something like that. God, this is going to be so difficult to blend. The VMPC port version. There might be a static recompilation version, which is like a much better PC port. At least that's my propaganda. But I do not work with the PC port, because I think it's garbage. I mean, it was made to be garbage. So it kind of is garbage. You get the idea. I don't want to explain it again. I've explained it too many times. What about Render96? What are you asking? You are a god? Not the god, just a god? Cool. Can you bless me? I'm not going to make a video shitting on the PC port and then get a bunch of people mad at me, being like, but the PC port is so good. And it's like, I don't want to argue with the thousand comments on my YouTube channel. It sounds like terror. The problem with expressing any kind of opinion in my videos is that I get way too many comments to argue with them. They're always like ridiculous ones. The one just now had a comment like, I'm 80 seconds into the video and you've already gotten 4 or 5 things wrong. And I'm like, no, I don't think so. And what do you want me to do? And the same would happen if there was a PC port video. People would just start hating me. Well, the thing on the R is that there really isn't a point to the PC port, especially the way it's done. It's still mostly emulated. The whole thing is a proof of concept that people that knew what they were doing made. Because they just wanted to prove that you can just natively compile N64 games for PC. And then somehow the wide public was like, oh my god, Mario on PC? This is the definite version. It's like, no, this is just a quickly thrown together tech demo. Like, this isn't what you're meant to use. And then people started using it like it is what they're meant to use. Whereas if you look at the static recompilation, this is made by a very competent person, Wiseguy. And it is made to be modded, which means there's many specific mod features and many cool things that actually are meant to be good. It is not literally just, oh, I threw something together. It's actually good. So I suggest people that want to play mods on PC, you guys just use the static recompilation. And if people ask me to put my mod on the static recompilation, I would be much more open to that. I would be like, yeah, that sounds like a great idea. My keyboard just clunked, this is true. What's the static recompilation stuff? And why isn't it more popular? Or is it what the what? Static recompilation is, basically it takes the N64 ROM and it compiles it into a mod on executable for a new PC. In the sense that it's running native code, it is the same performance benefit as the PC board. Graphically, it is much more efficient than the PC board because it is written by competent people that try to make it good. Instead of being thrown together as a proof of concept. So it actually runs games a lot faster than an emulator could. And it has other upsides like that. It also has a lot of modding support. So for example, if you wanted to mod Majora's Mask, you could use the static recompilation for that. And it will come with features that help you mod Majora's Mask. It lets you combine mods too. Talked to the guy that made it and he said even something similar to Minecraft lobbies was possible. Which would be so cool. Okay, why don't people talk about that because you're stupid. They don't know what you're talking about. That's why. Which is a way better way of doing it then. And you can even just port mods to it. Wiseguy said that maybe he can port my mod to it once it's done. Which would be really, really cool. There's nothing wrong with PC port conceptually. It's just the way that it's done is not interesting. I'd argue if you wanted to mod Mario 64 for PC, you should just take Mario 64 and port it to Unreal Engine. And you're done. Now you have a PC port with modern shaders and modern optimizations and everything on a new engine. Doesn't seem difficult even. Sure, I can make it an MMORPG. It's more like the wide public is uninformed. What a stupid. But I mean, how would they be informed, right? This is the basis of all marketing, right? The fact that people are uninformed and you just tell them things. And the more often they hear it, the more they believe it. I'm interested in developing for PC in general. I think it's an awesome platform. I definitely want to make commercial video games at some point. I think I have to move to that eventually. So hopefully then I'll move to PC development. Hello, Maui. Zephyrus area. We still need to finish part 15 of the overworld. And then there's only part... No, we need to finish part 13. And there's only part 14 and 15 left, which is above in the sky. And they're not connected to the rest of the overworld, so we can just hold off on those. Is there a hack, 100% memory save and no errors on Valgrind? I don't know what Valgrind is. And I will need a formal definition of the word memory save to answer the question. Contrary to popular belief, I am not educated on programming. I am just a crazy man with a hacks editor. Do you have fun making all these romhacks? Sometimes? Not all the time. Fun is not really something I think about when I make stuff. Do you have any buffer overflows? No buffer overflows, no memory leaks. Memory leak is impossible because I don't use allocs. Buffer overflows definitely exist. But I don't know if it's possible to trigger them. I imagine there are some glitches where you can trigger buffer overflows. What resolution does it run on real hardware? 240p. Streams being relaxing sounds like a good thing. I'm not complaining. Can I hope the Nintendo 64 temperature strat is real? It would be so cool to just make a video like Yeah, we're now using code to reduce the temperature of the N64 to make it run faster. It's just the right amount of ridiculous and also understandable. Is Volcano completed yet? Volcano is just kinda in the background here. Switch 2, your takes? It's exactly what I thought it'd be. It sucks that you have to buy another console. Software could have all existed on the Switch 1. But the software they showed is very cool. I'm not complaining. Although there is some cool new hardware gimmicks they added. The fact that the controllers now also can function as a mouse is very cool. I like that a lot. It's gonna make a lot more games possible. And in general it looks like gimmick games are back on the table. Pricing wise. I mean obviously the price is a lot higher than expected. Adjusted for inflation it's like a 20% increase in price. That sucks. It's not adjusted for inflation, what the fuck does that mean?  I feel like the games industry is a little bit at a point where Triple G games have become so expensive to produce that it might not be viable anymore to make them. And honestly I am up for that. I want more stupid $20 gimmick games from Nintendo. And less hyper polished, extremely safe, frustration minimized, samey garbage. Okay it's not garbage, it's like uninspired. Stop making expensive games, yes. Exactly. There are some games that are just like terrible. But I still like that they exist and I feel like by experiencing what's inside of them I have expanded my brain a little bit. Like Pokemon Shadow, we're playing that right now. It's terrible but like it's cool that it exists. Would you use Unreal Engine if you were to make a totally original non-hack game to sell? I would have to try Godot first. Because Unreal Engine is a little bit terrible. The build times in Unreal Engine are like awful. But Godot has like an interpreter language. I talked to one of the Godot contributors. Godot has like a Godot script that you can use. So you can prevent compile time. And the value of being able to quickly iterate your code cannot be underestimated. It should not be underestimated. You can very much underestimate it but you shouldn't. That'd be bad. There is just a bloat in the industry. Maybe. He's optimist Unreal Engine. Yeah. Good luck with that. Unreal Engine is a bloated nightmare. I do actually work with Unreal Engine for my day job. So I can make these statements fairly confidently. Could it not be C sharp? I don't really know what C sharp is. Is it any different from normal C? Because C++ is just C. I'm being $80 sex but the game looks awesome. I saw... I... In Mario Kart... I like the optimization aspect of like... You try to optimize your gameplay to beat the level as fast as possible. That's what Mario Kart is about for me. Mario Kart World looks like it doesn't have labs. Which means a lot of the optimization aspect falls away. However. It looks like it has a whole different type of fun. Where you get to explore the world and stuff like that. So I feel like this Mario Kart is very different from the other ones. And it is going to disappoint people in that sense. But at the same time I don't think it's gonna be a bad game. It's just gonna be very different. I think MK World should be $70. You live in America. It is going to be $100 for you by the time it releases. Yeah exactly Maui. I'm still waiting for Deltarune to be finished before I play it. I don't know. God damn it. There we go. How do you know what games should cost like? What does it should even mean in this context? I'm not really understanding what you're saying. I don't know why everyone is talking about Silksong. During the director's interview I'm talking about Silksong. I was like okay this is like a new Elden Ring game or something. Then I looked it up and it was Hollow Knight. And I didn't know people cared about Hollow Knight. If you guys wanna hear what my experience with Hollow Knight was. You're gonna hate this. This is like a Ragebait comment almost. Dude I'd be so good at Ragebait if I did it on purpose. Holy shit. So my experience with Hollow Knight is I boot the game on my wife's Nintendo Switch. And I move for 2 seconds. And I instantly notice this game doesn't have analog controls. And I turn the game off and never play it again. That's funny. That is so dumb. I will never play a video game without analog controls. Fuck everyone. I don't care. Unless it's on a platformer. If it's not a platformer I'm fine with not having analog controls. If it's a platformer I'm fine with not having analog controls. If it's a platformer I need analog controls. This part of the overworld feels a little uninspired. But we still have ideas to put in. Seems your DS is trampling. Yeah I'm not playing that shit. I don't use those wacky analog keyboard buttons. Analog keyboard buttons? You mean like on a box controller where you press buttons as button modifiers? Yeah I have used that. After you're done with this maybe you can go back and implement analog movement for Mario Bros. 1, 2, 3 and Mario World after building the controller with the analog buttons from 6 axis. That would be so funny. There is this one guy I know that just goes through every Nintendo 64 game and makes it widescreen. Imagine if I started doing that for 2D platformers and analog controls. Oh I see I've heard of that. Favorite salad types? I like crunchy salads. That's the only salad I will eat. I will not eat salad if it has salad dressing. Salad dressing is disgusting. I do not eat condiments. Sorry everyone, I can't stop. This one was 4C, the next one needs to be 4D of course because we had to eat the crunches you would like wraps with crunchy salads and celery. No not celery, celery is disgusting, go away. Celery smells and tastes like poison. It's like eating lemonade, let me not. This, this is what celery tastes like. This is how you do it. I don't think I've ever eaten an avocado. Dude, we're all being so autistic right now. Holy shit. Talking about food textures and celery. Maybe Biobak was right. Maybe I really am autistic. Did he ever try parsley root?  Hmm. This feels wrong. Did I get my areas wrong? No. This is part 11, so this one should be freebie. It's part 10. Part 11 is done here. So we need to add a warp 3D here. Gotcha. This one is 4D. Okay, I'm going to spend so much time in the next few weeks making videos because I have a Squarespace sponsorship, and they need me to make six videos in three months, but they pay really well, and I need money. Do you get enough emotions projected in your brain when you see emotional stuff? No. I am a very unemotional person. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So it's 3D and 4D. No. No, I don't know, man. I don't think it's that clear. Sure, I'm very focused on R64, but I mean, that doesn't prove anything. Most people are very fixated on their job. Oh, like you mentioned the pianist. But pianists, like not every pianist is artistic, even though they're very focused on pianos. Cases in the Nile. No. 4A. 4C. And this one is 4C. 4A. 3A. 3C. 4C. Wait, what else? Instead of the bingo, the math, or science, that doesn't mean terrible, terrible fate. Do you need tips to make lightmaps? No, I have no idea how to make lightmaps. That is the wrong warp. 4C should go to 1, and then 3C. Hey guys, I need to tell you, you know my R64 chaos is genius work? That made me laugh my ass off. Is it, do you mean the chaos edition, where it's like me as the guy? Oh shit, this video is starting to do better. Maybe my day isn't ruined. Let's fucking go. Hello, Bansai. Chaos existed way before that, but Daryl and Isa, they worked together to put me in my R64, and they called this chaos edition, and like it's spelled like my name. And I am the antagonist in this game. And I also voice everything. So now there's a version of Mario 64, with an evil Kaza floating around, trying to kill you. I'll be back in the day because of Vinesauce. Chaos edition was the first game I made that got popular. So that would be a place where many people found me for the first time. Okay, this entire overworld feels like it's scaled up by a factor of 2. And it's terrible. So are you gonna add the UI to every single area? UI?  Of course I made chaos edition. Who did you think chaos edition was made by? It's not glitching, I'm just not clearing the framebuffer, so you get the Hall of Mirrors effect. The gates of hell have opened. I hope it doesn't assault your ears too much. Okay, this overworld is big and sucky, and I hate it, and I hate it, and I hate it, and I hate it, and I hate it, and I hate it. What now? Let's check our notes. There's an area where it always rains, and I just added that because I thought it'd be cool. Right, there also has to be boza drilling into here. I forgot about that. A drill hole, panicking yojis around the drill hole, and warning of boza. 90 starships are to get past Kamek's magical barrier. Okay. Pirate crow's nest, houses for boza's miller, big asteroid crater, and then... Dude, this area is packed. We have to move some of that stuff. Now, there's actually a lot of ideas we have for this overworld, and it's actually so many that we cannot possibly fit all of them in. But, but, but, before we complain about that, look at this. The island is now complete. 360 degrees. You can go everywhere on this island. You can see every single square foot of land on this island. Isn't that fucking cool? To have an overworld like that, where you can literally go everywhere? I think that is super cool. We just need to make it good now. But the concept works. What is a dingpot? Can you really go everywhere? Well, okay, there's stuff like the forest area here, where you just have to imagine this is in bunny brushwoods. Or this volcano area here, where there's like a side level that you go in. Or like, you know, above the cave here, where you just have to imagine it's a big mountain. Or this here, where you have to imagine it's a forest. So, maybe not every square foot, but like, you get a 360 run around. Oh, now you will be able to warp to any course entrance for any course that you've entered from the overworld map. I don't know how many of you guys know about this plan, but there's going to be a map in the overworld that has like the entire thing. And it's gonna look kinda like this, and it's gonna unroll when you open the pause menu. And it's actually gonna have like a bird's eye view of the whole island from here. At least of all the places you've been to. I agree, and that is going to be the coolest shit ever. One thing I really like about the overworld now, the way it's set, is you enter here, this is the first overworld you get. And there's immediately the lighthouse and the mountain in the background, edging the viewer. About like, hey, this is a place that you can go later to, to explore. You make some progress, you get here. And you can't get over this gap, so there's another place that's like, yeah, later on you can explore that. And there's Bozo's Mines here, where you can't go in there immediately. So you keep exploring, you keep exploring, and you reach this area here. With a zoo you can enter, and a secret ghost house. But you can't go to the ghost house, when you try to go there, you just fade out. So what do you do? You... where's the entrance? Right here. You go back, you find the ice cap, and then you use the ice cap to go into the cave here. And you go through the cave, and you come out on this side, and you enter the lighthouse. And then it's like, oh my god, the lighthouse that has been there since the first minute. And then with the lighthouse you can shine a light here and enter this level. And there's no longer fog in the way. And then eventually you can... Also, when you're here, you can see the super happy tree and the giant, giant giant tree in the background. So you go through here, and... Hey, there's still the super happy tree and the giant tree in the background. And I think you can go there right away... You can. Hey, you see the super happy tree, but you can't go there, so there's still the giant tree in the background. So there's always like one thing, then you're like, oh my god, I wonder what that is, I need to go there. And even cooler, it's like, oh, once you get to this part of the overworld... You can use the bomb cap to blow up a hole here. And... oh my god, I'm back to where the ship is! And this is all gonna be one open world. The first one felt so much more planned and balanced than the rest of the overworld. I think that's just because I rushed through the rest of the overworld. But the first one definitely has a lot more going on. I think this part here is really good, where you go back to the beginning. Like I said, you can warp from the map in the pause menu. So... Is there a chance that Super Mario World 2 is hugely silent? I'm not sure what you mean. Hello, Dubsteep. I'm sorry to hear about your heavy legs. I hope you get better soon. Speaking of the comment you posted... How many extreme right-wingers on the internet do you think are bots? Because I feel like there's almost 80% of political discussion online... ...is bots. Like both left- and right-wing, actually. I think it's all bots. And one really funny thing that I've noticed recently... ...is that real people start talking like bots. I think this is like a social effect. Where it's like people are trying to imitate the behaviors of other people around them. But not realizing that the people they are imitating are bots. They end up imitating bot behaviors. And a lot of people start talking like bots. And I don't think this is just me schizo-posting. I think this is actually going on. You have not noticed that most people online are bots? I mean, if I just go to my video. Alright, let's see. Let's go to the beginning comments. Okay, so obviously, like, sexbot, sexbot, sexbot. This one is a sexbot.  Sexbot, sexbot, sexbot. Wow, you put a ton of effort into this one. This is super informative, thanks. He posted this 30 seconds after I posted the video. I'm pretty sure this guy is a bot. I don't know. I don't know how many of these are bots. But like... Not all of this can be real. There's no way. Yeah, on Twitter it's very extreme that everyone is just a bot. I don't know. Trying to get my engagement somehow. Am I a bot? I am a bot. Let's put on switch to the next box. Wouldn't you expect that? Is the next box old as fuck? Hi, a bot. I'm dead. Hello. Hello. Okay, let's think about how to make this more interesting. We need hidden stars. We have Peach visiting the island. Talk to her for a free star. We're thinking of this in part 13. Secret exit from part 6. Yes. Pecky Durn block in someone's house. Okay. Boobla infestation. We have that. I should note this is in part 3. In part 3. Bone Dragon go to in part 12. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Okay. Perfect. It's just the internet that's over. The species is still okay. This is 1, 2. 3. 4. 5.       12.      18.           29. 30.                                                          We got 8. We're missing 8 secret stars in the overworld that we all have to distribute somehow. So let's think about that. Still a surfboard and surf through rings for a star. I don't know if surfing through rings is really the pinnacle of fun. Sorry to say it.  We're going to have to trade some things with NPCs that would fit the overworld. Hmm. So one idea that PixelPallava had earlier today was that maybe there should be a shop to buy a magnet that will suck in coins and make coins collecting easier for you. But this would only really be reasonable for yellow coins. Actually, the way coins work, maybe that's not a great idea. No, I don't wanna deal with that. A trade quest. How are you imagining a trade quest? Like you buy an item somewhere and then you trade it for people? Until you have traded it a bunch of times. I don't think I mind a trade quest. Is he actually a bot? Maybe. Nice map. Well, we're working on it. Okay, wait. Cool idea. So I wanted a crow's nest from like a pirate ship. What if you could climb to the top of the crow's nest and find a treasure map that just had an X marked somewhere? And, oh wait, that's just a mesh at the bottom again. Okay, but the top of the crow's nest could have a star. But like, how do we make climbing up there unique? So a trade quest. The thing about a trade quest that I maybe don't like is that Mario doesn't really have an inventory. You realize that you're climbing near the ghost ship? What if you make a shortcut like a bean vine? Why? That just ruins the overworld. It makes no sense. Oh, maybe I'm not... This is what a crow's nest is.  Origami King is kind of a bummer, but the game would have been better if there was no game in it. And that's the unfortunate part. Zelda, there's warps. You can just hit a warp in the pause menu. That makes unlocking shortcuts quite pointless. But there are actually some shortcuts you can unlock. It's just that what you're suggesting makes no sense, because it would ruin the overworld. It wouldn't work. Because you would end up breaking it. There are specific star requirements you need for specific things. What do you mean about Morigami King? Is this what you meant? Origami King is fun to play, but engaging with the game mechanics is not fun. The fun in the game is everything that is not the game mechanics. It's the experience of the story, the walking around the world and stuff. So in a way, it is a game that would be better if there was no game in it. Does that make sense? I'm just phrasing it funny. I was going to give it out to Freedar, but if you want, I can charge you specifically 90 euros. What do you mean about Morigami King? Is this what you meant?  The combat in Origami King to me was so boring, that in one of the first fights, I just went to the bathroom during the fight and mashed A with the joycon in my hand and I still won. That's how big of a problem it is.  Games in Europe are more expensive because you have VAT. Europe is taxed out of a zoo. That's what you get for your free healthcare and stuff. You either can have $60 Switch games or you can have free healthcare. It's one or the other. That's what I'm saying. Maybe France doesn't put VAT on digital purchases. Actually no, that's a EU white law. Who is DMing me? I don't know. I came from Germany, but I now live in Canada. All the boss fights in Origami King are actually the only fights I like. This is the thing in Origami King's battles. When you fight a battle in Origami King, you get nothing for it. The only reason you would ever want to fight is because you enjoy the fight so much or something like that. But obviously you don't enjoy the fight enough to do it as much as the game requests from you. However, when you fight a boss, you don't just get something extrinsic as an EXP or anything. You get something extrinsic in the sense that you make progress in the story. Fighting a boss feels like something necessary that you do to get further in the game, whereas all the random enemies do not. Because of that, fighting the boss is not nearly as frustrating and tedious as fighting all the random enemies. Do you live in Canada while you're working on R6 Content? No, I was in Europe back then. In Germany. That's like an oddly specific question. Where did that come from? I don't know. No special thanks for 60 points. Interesting. But why are you asking if I lived in Germany back then? That's weird, no? You know what doesn't better drill today? The headman owes you money. As in like Mario owes you money. How are these two related? Oh, I see. Dang, that's a long time ago. Bro ghosted me for 6 years, can you believe it? Toby Cock? Oh, Toby Cock, of course I remember you! I'm playing all sorts of games at the same time, trying to not get myself bored. Dang it. I recently played WarioWare on the eShop. Not the eShop, on NSL, and WarioWare is a banger game. I actually met Charles Martin, did he owe you money too? I can't believe he's still playing.  Okay, I talked just now to the guy that did the measurements for whether the N64 runs faster at certain temperatures, and maybe we're gonna get a test going to see which N64 component needs which temperature to run optimally. That would be hilarious. Man, having watched me in like 2018 only to like watching me now must be like weird, because now my channel feels like it's so different. Back then I was just like a dude making Mario hacks and now people know me as the optimization guy. But I'm still just a dude making Mario hacks to be honest. Honestly, the temperature thing is less for the microseconds and more for the funny video title. We're in gamedev 2 now, that's nice. Sorry guys, only a mild cap and cone left. Today I'm gonna try to finish my fun project. Alright, nice nice, that's good to hear. The anime girl country roads? That would be for a better Sigma Omega. He was the one that would always bring in the country road anime girls. Oh, is your brother next to him? This seems like it's now a decent-ish layout for the mountains. We should think about the secret stars first before we do anything. There's one star plant in Peach visiting the island beach. Talk to her for a free star. That should be in this overworld I think. What is angina? I'm gonna google this, it's gonna be something nasty you know. Chest pain? Insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle? Oh, that sounds really bad. Oh I see, Peach's Fury is... Okay, when I made Peach's Fury I was like, I'm making this game knowing that this type of game design is really easy to pull off. All I need to do is just give the funny Bing Bing Wahoo platforming thing and then it's gonna be fun. So seeing that useless reference is funny. Okay. So, design slash progression is what we're trying to make. I see, I see.  Meluigi be in this mod? Maybe? Are you a smelly little bean? I don't think so. Paralegic Rocket League? That's such a bizarre game for Nintendo to announce. Like what? What was that for? Why'd they put them in wheelchairs and make them play basketball? That feels like it's offensive to someone out there. Okay. Was that offensive? Really? Maybe. There was one Mario 64 speedrunner who was in a wheelchair and he used to keep asking me, Can you put Mario in a wheelchair? And eventually I did it. And that was Super Ultra Causal Memeo Road 128 Stars Revenge Edition Deluxe Edition Extreme Chaos Edition. Or whatever. When did YouTube start recommending you my channel? I want to know this because it will help me get even more recommended. I kind of switched up how I make my videos recently. And I think I have a format that I personally like less, but that I think will do a lot better on YouTube now. Yeah, I actually think that's how Joel first heard about single flips. He kept calling them single flips in that video. Okay. Okay, I think I'm on the bridge or something here. Anyway, we need to think about the Peach Star. So do we actually want a star of Peach visiting the island? If we do, how are we going to make this interesting? Because if there's just a random platforming star in the overworld, that feels very wrong to me. See you there, Tobycuck.  I want every star in the overworld to kind of transform the overworld in a way. So maybe Peach shouldn't just be visiting the island. Maybe she should have some kind of issue that you help her with. So are you recommending me your live streams? You must have really weird preferences that YouTube thinks that that's what you want. But I mean... I guess they were right, so. Well I was thinking maybe she's surrounded by sharks or something and you come rescue her or something like that. Fellas, I have another Ragebite Opinion. I think the water temple is way overheated. I think it's completely fine. Her plane crash lands on the island. That's too much coincidence. Too much just random stuff we don't want and then this happens and then this happens and then this happens. I might have to shrink the zone overall a little bit too. As in cut this whole part out. It kind of feels poopy the way it's so big. I think you have to rescue her from crabs, but most of the crabs in this world are very harmless. I don't think people hate the water temple as much as people who defend the water temple say it's a toss. Oh, I see, I see. I remember I beat Ocarina of Time as just a small 6 or 7 year old kid and I had no specific feelings about the water temple. Maybe there's nothing you can do for Peach. Maybe Peach being on the island is just a bad idea. Maybe someone else is taking a vacation on the island. Maybe someone cooler. No, I'm not going to have an option of ultimaru 61%. What does that even mean? What do you mean by ultimaru 61%? Do you not want to be able to buffer inputs? Do you want Mario to do a half circle when you do this? Do you want to bonk on walls when you ground pound in front of them? Do you want this to bonk? Do you want to not be able to jump out of landing lag? Everything's hard for Yoshi. Yoshi is going to be all over the island. There's going to be like 15 different Yoshis. More than that even. This is the island of Yoshis. You do? Well, I guess just don't jump out of landing lag. It wraps in this game though. I think there are any. I think rescuing Peach doesn't work. I should think about something with the one area where it always rains. I think the area where it always rains would be so funny. What if there was a rain cloud following Peach? Peach should be here with an umbrella taking a vacation. There should be a rain cloud following her around. It's always raining where she is. And you have to get rid of the rain cloud somehow. She's going to be like, I wanted to have a nice tropical vacation, but I keep getting wet. This rain cloud is following me. Yeah, we have the story. I need to think of a way to get rid of the rain cloud then. But then how do you get rid of her? Off the cloud. Both of those make no sense to me. I skipped the first cloud and just shed us. Maybe there's a windmill or fence somewhere that can blow it away. We could have Mario carry Peach with like an animation. But that feels too out of character for Nintendo. Like a Mario shaped cloud or like a cloud with a Mario mustache. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Getting Peach to an area is not something we can just do. There needs to be a mechanic for that. So for that reason, I think your idea doesn't work out. Who wants something from me now? This idiot. She can be sick. That's so random though. Why is it Peach then at that point? We don't need to force Peach being in the game. It doesn't make any sense. We don't do it. But I do really want the area where it's just always raining. I had that on my list. I think it does like a very fantastical thing. Like a nice mystery to solve. The thing is, I thought of the mystery. I didn't think of the resolution to the mystery. Why would just one spot rain? An evil cloud? A cloud hexed by Kamek? No, you already beat Kamek at this point. Missions where you just bring items are very boring. We're not doing that. Cold Sela. What if there was a rain flower? Like the opposite of a sunflower. And the flower did it somehow. How would you make a rain flower? Maybe invert the colors? Maybe just a patch of these flowers and they make it rain somewhere. And you have to do something here. Oh, but that's so mean. Why would you just kill the flowers? No, I don't like that. But I like the rain flowers. Yeah, blue sunflowers. It's like rain flowers. Could be a batch of these flowers in the mountains somewhere. No, rain flowers wouldn't make it rain. But the question is how does this link to a star? This is a nice mystery. This is a nice resolution to a mystery. Now why would this give a star? Change the rain flowers to sunflowers. That sounds like it could work. What if Mark found weed killer and spread it around? I would probably put a batch of the sad flowers here. And they would make it rain all over the area here. And people would complain. And then you need to make them happy somehow. And I don't see how that's possible. Actually. How would you make a flower happy? I guess we could give the flower a face and make it blue. And it could be one flower. And then the flower could ask you to do something. Bring out the sun. The sun is out. I can erase this whole area here. I can erase this whole area here. That's kind of nice. It's a little better than before. I think we should get this as well. I think we should get this as well. Nope. Can make it so a rain cloud enemy keeps following Mario. After he talks to Peach and Mario has to bring it somewhere else. And the cloud needs water. That makes too little sense for me. I really like the idea of a blue rain flower though. It could be like a big flower that you talk to. A big sad flower. And the flower would say... Man, I miss when all the Yoshis were around. My life was so nice. And she's sad. And then you pay the Bowser's Builders that we planned to rebuild the Yoshi houses. And that's when the flower gets happy. Because all the Yoshis moved back. That's the idea. Yep, that's what we'll do. This works. Fuck this Peach star. In part 13 there is a blue sun flower. She's sad and that's causing rain to happen all around her. She's sad because the Yoshis are sad. The Yoshis are sad because their houses were destroyed by Bowser. You can cure their sadness by paying Bowser's Builders to rebuild the houses. Once the Yoshis are no longer sad, she has a cutscene where she turns yellow, spawns a star, and the rain stops. There we go. It does not have a shower garden now. Okay, we're still on 8 secret stars. That means we need 8 more secret stars. I think the flower is going to be here. Or maybe it's going to be around here. I don't know. Let's test the rain flower star. That means the star has to be built. The Bowser's Builders neutral towards Mario. Bowser's Builders are initially part of Bowser's crew. But after the working conditions and the OSHA violations in Koopa Carnival, they decided to desert. That's going to be the backstory. Did I unionize? Well, in Oily Boily Bay, there is a mission where you unionize and Bowser tries to break the union. The minions in this universe canonically did unionize. And then they de-unionized pretty quickly. Because Bowser kind of destroyed them. I mean, is there a better way to make Bowser instantly be portrayed as evil than to make him break a union? I did not watch the Minecraft movie and I don't intend to. God, culture moves so goddamn fast. Just yesterday I thought all we were going to talk about today was going to be Switch 2. And now we're talking about the Minecraft movie as well. And that was the first thing people wanted to talk about when I started streaming. We didn't even talk about Tralala today. We already moved past Tralala. Can you believe it? They're using Sigma in kids' conversation moves. Yeah, Sigma is like kids' children's right now. I think there was fire and they did a good job to show what the Switch 2 is up to. But man, that inflation. Yeah. You know what bothers me the most about the Switch 2 discourse? It is people that talk as though Nintendo is increasing the price because they're evil and want to screw people over. Rather than because they think that's going to make the most money. It's like these people do not have a single thought in their brain. They just say, I don't like that this is happening, therefore this is evil and I must spread hate. It's not evil, it's just greedy. They are a corporation. Their one goal is to make as much money as possible. It's not greedy or evil, it's neutral. A corporation is as close to moral neutral as it can be. They're literally not even a person. They are an entity that is made to maximize money. Sure, you can argue that the system that allows this existing is evil or something, but that has nothing to do with the corporation. Thank you for watching this video. I hope you enjoyed it.    Their entire purpose. If a corporation ever pretends to not be evil, then it is because they want to make more money and they think that having the image of not being evil gives them more money. That's literally it. Oh yeah, I don't blame you for not paying for it. I wouldn't buy a Switch 2 either. Oh yeah, I don't blame you for not paying for it. I wouldn't buy a Switch 2 either. Oh yeah, I don't blame you for not paying for it. I wouldn't buy a Switch 2 either. Never checked if this one works. Cool. Why does it not work? 3D. This is 4D, not the one I want. 4C is the one I want. 4C goes to 3C, that's wrong. 3D. It also needs to go to 3D here. Oh well, actually it doesn't make sense, but 4A needs to go to 3D. And then this one needs to be 3D. It looks good.  Okay, that seals the position of the plant. So I guess that means we're gonna have Yoshi houses around here. So we should set up for that. Make a bunch of places where houses can stand on. The weirdest part about this argument I had was that someone was saying they're just trying to min-max profit. They probably just ran some math to figure out what the optimal price would be according to their assumptions. And then the person responded, now they're trying to minimize their profits. Because this is gonna make them less money. Why would they try to minimize their profits? Are they so evil that they're fine making less money if it means that it screws you over specifically? What kind of nonsense is that? Yeah, Nintendo fans are kind of like the biggest babies. They're always complaining about the game and then buying it anyway. Your life is empty. Your life has no meaning. You have no purpose in life. You're gonna buy the game anyway. Why are you complaining? It doesn't do anything. If you actually wanted to complain, maybe don't buy the game.  Now the person was saying they're minimizing profits. Why would they try to minimize their profits?    It doesn't do anything. If you actually wanted to complain, maybe don't buy the game. Now the person was saying they're minimizing profits.  And still buy it. I also am someone who would prefer to pay less. You know, that's why I pirate games. I prefer to pay less. I mean, I don't pirate games. That's illegal. That's why I only play free games. Because I prefer to pay less. You can't pirate free games. Come on. I also like to just play a game and then sell it. I feel like that's something people don't do a lot. Because after you beat the game, you just sell it to someone. And it's like, yeah, now you have the whole experience of having played the game. And you have your money. You ate your cake and you had it too. You know what I mean? Yeah, I am assuming at launch there just wouldn't be a compelling reason. Because there's no games yet. It makes sense. There's never been a compelling reason to buy a console at launch.  All right. What do we have next? The Krause nest. Right. So I want there to be a pirate Krause nest. It's like a long stick with like a thing at the top that you can climb on. I think that would be very cool to have. But also what's going to be in there? I don't actually know yet. I think it would be a cool thing to stick in here. What if we stack it in here and then that's just part of the platforming. Oh, that would look so cool. I'm doing that. This is a wild song. Does it really matter to game developers whether you pirate their game or you buy their game and then instantly reset it after you're done? Is there a difference for Nintendo between these two scenarios? Is it metal spy? Explain in your own words. One gives a number and the other doesn't. Is that true? Because I mean me resetting my copy means that Nintendo is going to sell one copy less, right? Does it not? No. Yeah, I know that most people don't resell their games. But I actually do. I do resell all my games once I'm done with them. I don't hold on to video games usually. Are you working on the overworld? Battle League? What is Battle League? Oh, I guess you could even just refund games at the store. I didn't even think about that. If you beat a game in like two weeks, what's stopping you from just refunding it at the store? That's actually an insane strategy if you can do that. You can probably do that at Costco, right? Costco's return policy is so strong. I've heard. Okay. I don't want grossness to jump on. I like it. That is funny or brimmy. Okay. But I guess it makes sense that people would take advantage of Amazon's return policy. I remember one time there was someone trying to abuse eBay's return policy against me. And I could tell from the second this guy started talking to me that he was a complete dipshit. So I made sure I had absolute proof that everything I sent him was exactly as it was. And he later tried to sue me over fucking eBay. So I actually had to go to the police and be interrogated to get my witness statement or whatever. My testimony. And I just went without a lawyer and I won the case before I even went to court. It was very stupid. You know, when I first got the message like, you have been sued, come to the police department so we can get your position. I was like, okay, well, Nintendo finally did it. But nope, it wasn't. Like literally everyone thought it wasn't them though. But it was just this one dipshit from eBay. Why? This was in Germany way back. It's because I sold Kirby the Crystal Shards on eBay. And the guy that I sold it to claimed he never received it. He claimed I stole money from him when I clearly did not. Because I resell all my games after I played them. Okay, those are some nice places for houses. This one could also be a place for a house.  Yeah, that works. I think this could be another place for a house. Okay.  I know retro gaming is awesome. But it was salty eBay scammer. See, the way I proved my case was I used tracked shipping and they would get the weight of the box I would send beforehand. And the guy was a little bit stupid. He claimed that the box arrived empty. But because they knew the weight of the box at the weigh-in when I sent off the box, it was clear that it couldn't possibly have been empty. So from that fact alone, it was clear that the guy was lying in some way. Or that there has been an issue on the shipping company's part and it couldn't have been my fault. I'm excited for the new Mario Kart. It looks fun, but in a very different way from the other Mario Kart games that exist. So in a way I do want to play it, but I don't want to play it with other people. Okay. What? It's just Diddy Kong Racing? I don't see this at all. How is it Diddy Kong Racing? Oh, you mean like with the open world? In the sense that Diddy Kong Racing also is an open world where you explore and stuff? You think there's gonna be a story mode in it like Diddy Kong Racing? That actually sounds fucking insane. Yeah. Like, okay, if the game is not just racing and there's like a whole story mode in it and that's what the open world is for, then that would be crazy. That would be so cool. All right, we got plenty of spaces for broken houses now. Okay. I am not anticipating Snoop Dogg or DVD as playable characters. What? You don't know whether Mario Kart World is fair? Oh, but like an hour ago you said you knew exactly what the fair price would be. Remember? Remember when you said that? Huh? I do. And I knew it was nonsense when you said that. Anyway. I think we're good for today. I'm glad that we now have the full 360 view of the island done. The last part of the island definitely needs a lot more improvements. And we will need a lot more improvements across the island by planning the eight secret stars that are still missing. We want them to be stars that once you collect them it changes the overworld in a way. So this is going to make everything feel very, like, alive, hopefully. Anyway, I will see you guys in the next stream, whenever that will be. Bye bye!
