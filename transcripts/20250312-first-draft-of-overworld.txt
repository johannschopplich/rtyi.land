Hello. Hello, Links. Hello, Nintendo4life. Linkso. I'm just trying to say it wrong. Hello, Droidseeker. I think the fork effect works now. Hello, SonicTheHedgehog. Hello, TechnicMaster. Yeah, I'm kinda happy with the fork effect here. I see what's coming along. It's going well. It is a big banana, but we need it. Hello, NeoVamp. Let me see. My wife sent me something here for the zoo entrance. Not this. Not this. This was the idea. I need some OST. One thing I don't like about this zoo entrance is that you can just jump over the fence. MarioFailURL.ost. Alright, let's do it. To Amicia. Overworld are very important. Then it's supposed to actually be Wario. Hello, Zeina. Zeina, take your fucking phone off the counter. I hear it vibrating and it's so irritating. I will go insane.  Yes, Iris. It was on the counter. I heard it being on the counter. I am going to go insane if it's on the counter. Hello. Hello, Leela. I can't say bad enough. Wait, I know where I can change this. That's what I'm going to change. Is this over an island? Yep, it's an island. In the shape of a Yoshi hat. And it's gigantic. Wait, does Mixed Mario just not spawn? The hell? I guess it doesn't work that way. Johan, thank you for the 100 euro donation. Holy shit. That is very appreciated. Wow. Thank you very much. Today is more of an overworld planning day. Is that real? That is real. Okay, our current task is to... We want to make it so that... First of all, you need the ice cap to get to the next part, which will be around here. And then we need the zoo entrance somewhere around here. The zoo is going to be inside here. I also want to get rid of this hole here. Which I don't even know why there is a hole. Oh, I see. Okay. It's slightly offset for some reason. Is the Yoshi circle going to double dash? Nope. That's the progression for the overworld to work. You're supposed to go to different floors, but you're just going to climb higher in the air. How does this one work? You get deeper into the island. Why are there caps? Can it just be like mushrooms or flowers? Because caps is Mario 64. That's how Mario 64 does it. You need to act more excited. I'm sorry. I just don't have a very large emotional range. Thank you for feeding my family. Dead? Hello, Bowser. Yeah. So. What if Mario had like a larger fence around? There need to be mountainous walls around the zoo entrance somehow. The problem is, I can't show the zoo through the overworld, because that's, you know, polygon count. I have not played Kara Quest now. I'm sure it's an enjoyable game, but I'm just not really a fan of Brodude's games in general. Just the way he designs his games does not resonate with me at all. I don't know. Seems a bit too big. No, I don't think so. Yeah, I know you had a zoo ticket stand. The question is, how do you get into the zoo? Because if it's like, this is the ticket stand you had. But obviously with a fence like this, you can look past the fence and then see the level. I did see you play some over there. Hello, Porcupine Quilts on my pizza. Dude, the video I uploaded today where I just talk about my favorite games, that's like my most disliked video on Case Clips ever. It has three dislikes. What the hell is going on? Do people just hate my favorite games? Am I talking badly about my favorite games? What's going on? I think trees and foliage. Maybe? I think it's important to remember what the zoo actually looks like. I set up a new test overworld so we can easily enter the zoo. It should be this one. This is how it looks like on the inside actually. So maybe a big gate would be most appropriate for the entrance. And it's balled in like this too. I think we should copy the gate here. No, I don't agree. What do you not agree with, Lila? Oh, the gate will look out of place. Also yes, we're probably gonna have to turn the ship into a 3D render. We can't just use what we have right now. Because of the obvious issues with it. But I'm not doing that right now. It's a different place at a different time. You don't need the gate to make it make sense. What do you mean it's a different place at a different time? And the ticket center is gonna be run by Wario. So I'll definitely... The way you enter this is that you actually buy a ticket. Do you buy a ticket? Let me see what I have noted down here. A monkey somewhere else tells you that he will trade you a zoo ticket for a watermelon. Grab the watermelon using the ice cap box. That's what it says here. Kinda works. What's the banana for? It's Yoshi's Island, man. They have a big fruit. Animal SFX, maybe? I'm not shit-talking you. I'm not shit-talking you. I think I'm just gonna make it the ticket stand idea with... ...this kinda going on. Is the underwater level a submarine docked by the harbor? It is a submarine, but it's not docked by the harbor. It's in an underwater cave. There will be tons of easter eggs in the overworld. Like secret stars and character interactions and stuff like that. I haven't really thought about it yet, though. I don't know. My favorite MIPS OP code? Uh... Adieu. I don't know. Come on, load the level. Oh. Yeah, our kid keeps getting sick. It's actually tragic. Come on, load the level. I'm gonna lose it. Hello, Weusel. I think tomorrow is when I upload the video saying I'm looking for beta testers for Drug Mario. And open the applications officially. So, what I'll do here is, I'll put the door from the Course 4 here. Then we'll put the stand. Actually, I can already start working on the stand. Like, I can just do that. I don't need the level for that. Okay. Okay. Is this radius or what is it? Okay, it's that length. Perfect. Chat, he saw our messages and he's not answering. I don't remember this. Two weeks ago, she had the flu and kept sneezing. Oh. I see, I see. Your knees. Nope, that sucks. Well, using Blender is easy, right? Just like making geometry is super, super easy. If you know what you want to do, Blender is baby mode. The difficult part is often figuring out what you're supposed to do. It's the good graphics aspect that's the difficult part, for me at least. Hmm. They are a lot thicker in Zaina's drawing, so maybe I should make them thicker too. True. We should just end up something like Japan has it, where it's like, if you're sick, you're just going to be wearing the mask to not spread it as much. I think that's very reasonable. But unfortunately, wearing a mask has been made into a political issue, so you can't do that anymore. See, okay. I'm actually at a point where I'm afraid to tell people that it would be a good idea to wear a mask when you're sick, because I'm scared that people are going to be like, oh, so you're a libtard, huh? You're on that side, huh? It's like, I don't know. I want to take a political stance. Please take a political stance here. Nope. I don't have political opinions. My political opinion is whatever will make me the most money in the long run and get me the most subscribers. I'm a company now. Can bench 300 pounds who cares about their opinion? True. The other side is anti-science bullshit, so no worries. Yeah. But I mean. OK, think about this. Imagine if like 5% of my audience. You know what? Never mind. I'm not finishing this. Never mind. See, there is a halo effect going on where it's like if you see someone online that you like, you're going to assume that their opinions on most things coincide with yours. That's just an implicit things we as humans do. So whenever I accidentally take a stance on something or maybe even not accidentally take a stance on something, I'm going to lose a small percentage of my audience or I'm going to be less sympathetic to a small percentage of my audience. That's why most companies, creators, even political candidates try to avoid taking a stance on anything. They do this political doublespeak thing where they give you a non-answer that you can interpret however you want. And people will use the halo effect to just assume that the interpretation that they come up with, that makes the candidates agree with their own opinion is the correct one. And that's why it is technically a mistake to take stances. Thank you, Scott. Return to Yoshi's Island. Thinking fast and slow. Oh, is that from there? Thinking fast and slow is a very good book. It's re-engagement. No, it doesn't work that way, neither. Since you still make pro trends and whatever and half the engagement is right-wingers. That makes sense. And they give you that fluoride stare. The fluoride stare. I've seen people talk about the lead paint stare and I think that's a very funny meme, even though it's kind of sad. Okay, but if it's real, why are people making fun of it? That's literally just sad. That seems kind of cruel to me. No? This is just a preliminary UV map. Do not get upset at this. It's just supposed to look like something. Did I put a Z-buffer on all of this? Huh, interesting. Wait what? Explain this to me. What is temporal fragmentation shit? I'm fully willing to believe that watching YouTube shorts and Instagram reels cooks your brain. But I need more info on this. It's the aquarium, yeah, because it's Various Zoo. Hello Samuel. Then you lose track of time. Well, don't you lose track of time every time you're engaged in something? Of course you lose track of time because you're engaged with it. Any video on the 22nd can result in an error. Obviously no new memories are created when you're doomscrolling for a decade. That just sounds wrong. Doesn't pass the sniff test. It's on surface level wrong already to me. It sounds like the I can only see 20 frames a second level bullshit to me, to be honest. Anything who uses their phone more based on brain scans? Well, I wouldn't expect that. Just because it shows up on brain scans doesn't mean it's good or bad. Dude, what the fuck is going on here? Oh my god, dude. I guess that's good enough. So everything in the oil looks very crappy right now because it's all temporary. I was surprised that I received comments that were like yeah this is starting to look nice and it's like no it fucking doesn't. This is actually something that I think people should be more worried about and that is false positive feedback. Something I feel like I have to be very worried about because I know people like me and I know people are inclined to give me positive feedback because they like me. So if you like me and you're telling me that something I make is good, I will put less weight on that than if you hate me and you tell me something I made is good. It is because I'm a rational actor like that. So I try to be as unbiased and rational as possible to get the best outcomes. Temporary equals permanent but you don't know it yet? Dang. Have any misaligned vertices? For sure. What the fuck is cope at that end? Oh. Oh I can't use shade color here. I'm just gonna have to use like primitive color alpha. I think that's fine. Yeah probably ketone. But it's not like I am able to sketch so what am I gonna do? It says let's just try to praise something first and then follow it with feedback. I'm guilty of just two otherwise you get people telling you you're nitpicky. Uh yeah I think that works for normal people. Because I feel like a lot of your comment sections are heavy on suggestions even when the current version looks better. I know this edition is worse than what we have right now. That's true. I mean I often, I would say around just random guess without really thinking about I would say around 80% of suggestions make things worse. But that's fine. My job as the lead designer on this game is to figure out what the 20% are. And because of my personality type I'm very much immune towards like feeling bullied by criticism or anything like that. So when people criticize my stuff I don't mind. Like I'm actively trying to foster an environment where people are critical of the stuff I make. There is the saying that if you want the correct answer to something you should post the wrong answer and wait for people to correct you. In a similar way you can just showcase your stuff and have people tell other people that the stuff that that you're seeing is great and then people will come and like try to nitpick. And I actively want that to happen. What the f**k? Why, why the f**k is he swimming? Oh I know why. I hate this. Thank you Leela. If people want to know, yeah. When people have specific suggestions I usually ignore the specifics. What they're just saying and address the emotion they're expressing in the request. Because people are very bad at requesting specifics. No, it's this floor here. The first floor turned that into water. Ah, not every game you play for a long time is a well-designed piece of art. Example, League of Legends. Most people playing that game hate that game. Well better now you're nitpicking something that's not even part of the game, right? Now you're just nitpicking a temporary visual that is not going to actually be in the game. So that's obviously not desired. That's just like noise pollution. Game sound like the ultimate art form. It's the only art form that like incorporates every single other art form we have. Okay, maybe not every single, but it combines a lot of art forms and a lot of tech and math and everything. You'd say almost every. Okay, how does it incorporate the art form of pottery? How does it incorporate the art form of aquascaping? What are you sculpting? You're sculpting right now? Okay, well that's taking it very loosely. Games are in. Yeah, exactly. How does it incorporate the art form of cooking? I mean, I guess you could make a cooking game, but that wouldn't really be in the spirit of the challenge. But you don't have to do pottery to design a video game, you know. Yeah, it's basically any social media platform. It's just propaganda. It's like obviously that's gonna happen. It replaced the news and we all know how the news are. Obviously on Twitter you would just get indoctrinated. If you use the blue marker blocker, you would be blocking me too. Do you want to block me on Twitter? Come on, man. All right, let's see. Let's go. I wish I could get rid of the blue check mark. I got to the blue because I thought it would be easier to block. Maybe I can monetize my tweets. Do you guys want to know how much money Twitter Blue made after five months? You guys want to see this? 23.76. That's the entire Twitter ad revenue I've gotten so far. But for some reason it hasn't paid me out for three months. The whole rumshack totally. Okay, the whole rumshack is also just a bunch of people with like one brain they all share and I count it as just one opinion. It doesn't mean anything to me. I don't know about liberals. After all, there are some people in rumshack saying slurs like Leela herself. I have a plugin for that called Fast64. You probably have made more than only fans. Honestly, yeah. Okay, obviously this stream is boring as hell. But before we go to fixing that, we need to think about this. How does the coastline continue here? I think it has to continue like so almost. I don't think there's much we can do about this. If I can't get a check mark, there's no way to do it. Like how would you do it? I'm glad that I could say that slur and it was a question. This is true. Lilaa's slur was a self-attack or however you call that. I can unsubscribe but I can't hide the blue checkmark and I also, you know, it was 40% off and buying it for a whole year was very cheap. So I bought the whole year. Yeah Reddit is useful for niche interests, I agree. Make a big sting on the homepage. People are just gonna make fun of you for the degree. You bought to the blue, you fucking idiot, it's your own fault and now you have to mark a shame. I don't need that in my life. Okay, so we want the player to use the ice cap to make progress in this direction. How do we prevent the player from just forever walking around the beach? I guess that's a good question. A line of voice. Now Zeina's definitely being old right now. Zeina's becoming a boomer. Can't really type on PC. Wait, what? The fish that do damage? No, they are not a barrier. You can just swim past them. I need something physically making it so that no player would think they can just swim this way. Now I'm not just killing the player for no reason. This is terrible ideas. Random rock? No. This barrier here makes sense because you fade out or into the level. It works. But we need something that we can apply to multiple overworld parts because we also need a way to tell the player they can't go past here. Or past here, I guess. Cliffhanger234? No! It could be whirlpools that drag you down if you enter. Then you can get past it with the ice cap. There's just an edge you can't go past. Invisible walls. The problem is I need the player to be able to get here for the next overworld part. Shove a rock barrier? It doesn't make any sense, unfortunately. I like forcing the player to do something like this to enter the next part. I think that works well. How could we both be connected to it? I don't know. It's not going to be something weird. Some big beast with a mushroom next to each other. No, it will not be like that. Don't worry. It's a proper overworld. This song is also a banger. I would like to make the player aware that they need the ice cap here. How about I put an island here where you get the ice cap? I don't know. This is very cool, but why wouldn't Mario just be able to walk on that? Do you know what I mean? Two natural waterfalls that the player has to walk on would make a good world design. It would look very cool, but it doesn't make any sense here, unfortunately. There's still a chance to do that in a later part. There's a part with waterfalls here. Maybe not. Let me just write it down here somewhere. A part with two waterfalls that you have to use the ice cap. I have written it down. Make a tall island Mario jump right out of the water. Honestly, yeah, you might be onto something. I will give that a try. It looks very high pony, but I think that's a cool idea. We'll try it. Where's CCM? Am I blind? What's going on? Oh, well, I think it's two. Unless I removed it from CCM for some reason. I'm going to count it easily. So, and. Where's my exclamation box? I forgot to give it a model. And a behavior. Let's try that again. Added some graphic tiftler. Where's my ice cap? Either way, it looks like kicking up here will be an easy time. I am worried though, where the fuck is my ice cap? I don't know. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.   Let's have some debug print here, see what happens. Melted true. I've never had a why is it working moment. I think that's just a programmer being bad meme. I don't like the meme where a programmer is just joking about how they're bad at programming. That's just not funny to me. Okay, action zero. Wait, what? Did Mario just put his hat back on? Ah. My face is itchy, don't scratch it. Okay.  And other risk is that this would be missing. Yep. I must have disabled that. Actually, ice cap. Oh, it's metal cap geo is gone. Well, that wouldn't do it. I killed it. Oh, nice, Graham. Oh, yeah. Do you guys notice a change in sound quality today?   What do you think?  Where's your keyword is sold out. Mm hmm. You change. I turned off and video broadcast. You sound good, but I've been able. Yeah. Okay, that sounds about right. It's less noise filtering. But the stupid Nvidia broadcast filter issue is gone. Because Nvidia broadcast would constantly cut my voice. Okay, I see. I will need to actually import the model correctly. That kind of stinks, but we can do that. No, let's see. It will not. And no, I'm not adding an option for it. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think that's looking good. Do I not have a shock mount here, actually? Can there's still something mysterious to me and that is that even though the cap was collectible. I see. That would be an issue. Okay. I don't know what a reasonable height looks for this. 5050 seems decent. The shadow was too big. So maybe 75. And I think it was also too opaque. The whole morning cleaning your room. I would never clean my room. How many of you guys actually use a razor instead of just a hair clipper? Because I had to use a razor for the, if you can't tell, I'm sponsored by Manscaped now. I had to use the razor for it. And it seemed so much more cumbersome than just using a hair clipper. For my face, by the way, not my balls. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. They are like really annoying and waste a lot of time I mean I guess hair clipper is not perfectly clean shaven but like good enough literally takes me 20 seconds to shave 20 seconds man I don't like how a full beard feels on my neck so I'm pumping yeah so that's how you make progress here I think that's pretty cool oh yeah shaving gel feels nasty man I don't know how the caps got so messed up that's weird is it not okay I like this it's decent nope it's ice cap all right so the next idea we need to play out to go across here somehow I'm thinking maybe we can just have them enter a cave here and that leads to the next part I think a cave would feel a little more mysterious I have no idea what that is capped off never used it never heard of it the small isn't supposed to look good or anything it's just literally a garbage texture used to play with shaving cream on how do you play with shaving cream what kind of games do you play with shaving cream man fair enough I just don't really care I'm so close to posting in the like what people say rushed code looks like versus what it actually looks like because like what it actually looks like is you're not renaming variables like that maybe we're only using see it's got all tomorrow goes to okay once you may know I have nothing to do with b3b1 free actually wait I did do some work on b3 3 1 3 that I not keep forgetting people are saying that the b3 3 1 3 contributors list is like almost like the Epstein I learned flight block and that if you're there you are now officially a beta kitty ha what the hell was that the Xbox just failed Lilaa Halloween kit man oh it looks so cool with all the spiders I don't understand why the water ice thing is not there though it's a little weird yeah I don't know how b333 manages that it's like they produced more drama than Romek at this point true dark fleece oh yeah we are listening tomorrow galaxy good observation the house of white first now I don't think this is first no oh man this is really really big the overload is way too big hello ready ready schmitty so obviously the overall is way too big and we need to shrink it but also we need to fill all the empty space with something here so let's think about what experience we want the plan to have how it's very big and empty and there's a level select world with secrets here and there I guess it's kind of different and that the overworld and this is supposed to be like one whole island where you can explore every single angle of it and you unlock more of the island as you get through the game and I think that's very cool I like that a lot I think this is a cool effect too that we pulled off so you walk towards the ship everything gets really foggy no no no no so let's think about what we want the player to do we want the player to we definitely want them to try to enter this level here and fail you will fail because the fog just feeds you out and I think that's a given and we want the player to enter this level and fail and I think that's also a given because you are unable to enter this because of power you're charging too much money well yeah I'm thinking about how to fill it right now sonic and whether I need to shrink it so they're gonna have to be somewhere and then well yeah that would be part of an iris but yeah you would get a full 360 view of the shore there is a crazy flicker but that's just a temporary render but it doesn't matter it's easily solved there I solved it yeah that's why we need to shorten the transition I think yeah that's definitely gonna happen Sonic the flicker is gone but now the wide is just there great lovely let me just fix that real quick I didn't think that would happen 0 1 2 3 that's why yeah okay but we need to think about the gameplay purpose of this first so the gameplay purpose of this is to make you eager to enter the ghost ship and the zoo now maybe the player should be able to enter the zoo earlier maybe it's a bad idea that you need the ice cap to enter the zoo because we want the player to be able to do something here it's gone rocker it's been replaced with this part here which I mean it's a very similar area right conceptually it's just as only as two course entrances instead of three and there's more to it yeah I think we should let the player into the zoo earlier I think that is the solution here yeah Yoshi still get captured so we need a different way to unlock the zoo and then course 5 you unlock later I think that's way cooler because it makes you have course 5 stick in your mind around longer and then with the ice camp you can unlock course 5 and then you don't even need the ice camp to make progress into the second puzzle level that's better that is better that was weird it's gonna be something like this I guess like a thorn here zoo is closed hello dana the bunny zoo is in fact closed no entrance for stinky big-nosed plumbers especially ones in red hello bio back nice boats true welcome to the overworld paladin stream why not just adding invisible ones out of a high fence because it's supposed to make sense to the player you're supposed to visually see that you're not permitted in barrio has secured this with military base tier security i think this is funny because it kind of like implies that barrio just took this over okay we need a new way to enter the zoo because i hate what we have right now i need this to not be based on the ice cap because the ice cap is already required for Course 4 at this point the fear is that you enter this part of the overworld and you don't find anything useful to do you have italian oranges what i thought you were like i thought your dna was like a hundred percent just forget i'm sure you can somehow do that i mean i can do this what do you think of this effect here i don't know if you were there for it two days ago ships here ships here ships here we walk towards the ship everything is getting foggy and now you would just like warp out when you get too close now you're in the fog zone i have no idea where i am ancestry wise and then to get to the next overworld you will have to unlock the ice cap here and then with the ice cap you can get up here which will lead to the next overworld zone i'm 100 sigma this one definitely will need some kind of mip map like holy shit What? Why not? I guess I should clarify that the next part of the overworld is only there so you can unlock course 5. So you don't actually need to find it. You only need it to enter this level here. It does feel way too big, Leela, I agree, but I'm still thinking about it. We need to first think about how to enter course 4. Yes, I agree, it's definitely way too big and empty. I know, guys, stop telling me it's too big. How long did you practice programming without getting boring? I never practiced programming, I was just working on my hacks and practicing programming was just an accident. We ran into small areas because there's only a running overworld thing. It's gonna get smaller. Probably. We need to think about how to enter course 4. Look, this is my plan. We figure out how you enter course 4, which is this level here. We add the necessary geometry for that and then we shrink this to the minimum size that keeps all the elements that we like. Alright, yes, it is big for now, no one cares, it's fine. I see a huge banana. I got bored of putting cliffs. I think just having everything gated off with cliffs would be lame and I think huge fruit is fun and I think it fits Yoshi's Island. I was thinking of this Mario Party board here, you know how there's like fruit around everywhere? I was thinking of taking some elements from this. Why would you want to give away your stars, Technic Master? We don't need a band-aid solution, guys, we're still modeling this. Okay, guys, you need to fucking log in and deal with the issue at hand first, which is how do we enter course 4? Guys, log in, you need to actually, you know, get with the times. We're thinking about how to enter this level. A warp in the door would be good. Yeah, but like, are you saying this level should just be open by default, like you can just walk in? I think that's not great, you're just messing with me, okay. A Wario stars? Nah, I don't like the idea of Mario giving away stars, especially not to Wario. Smips are so big, thank you TF, so useful, I love hearing that. Why no coins anymore? Well, the original idea was that he'd charge you however many coins you have plus 1, but we can also just make it so he charges you 500 coins or something, but I think that's a little bit lame. Hello, I'm a wall creature, I'm here to get away from you. Yeah, so my initial idea was Wario would charge you however many coins you have in the inventory plus 1, and then you'd have to trick someone else or pay someone else to help you away into this. No, cross forest a zoo, grow a vine plant, fits with the giant fruit idea. We make him ask for egg stars and then he complains that they aren't actually gold and lets you win anyways because he is tired of standing. No. When the player gets into this overworld, I want them to be able to enter this level by just figuring out how to enter the level. I don't want them to get here and be like, hmm, nothing to do here, nothing useful here, let's just go back to the previous overworld. So for that reason, making a star barrier here is actually ruining the game. Yeah, my idea earlier was also that there would be a mole and the mole would dig you a tunnel into this and like Wario would just not let you in at all. Penguin outside helping you get inside to free his family. Hmm. Maybe that would not be so bad. Yeah, that would fit with the story of the level. How would the penguin help you? If you have your amount of coins plus 1 and you can't pay, so you see an escaped lion or animal in the ocean, you actually ship and he helps to bring you into the zoo because he thinks you're crazy. No, that makes no sense. Finding a ticket. Yeah, initially there was going to be a monkey that just treats your ticket for some fruit or something. So finding a ticket, I am somewhat on board with that idea. The level entry cannot be tied to stars. They are very similar to Delirious. The penguin works because the story inside the zoo is all about free penguins. So it was the best penguin outside giving you a ticket. That would be perfect. We could have a penguin literally just looking like standing around here and looking around asking you if you can help and then he gives you the ticket. Catch Penguin. Would it be the boss penguin or like the little smart penguin? Why not catch them? Did the penguins are menaces? They're very smart. Can be them because they're in the zoo. I think it makes enough sense that they go into the zoo after you catch them. No, it has to be a ticket. Otherwise, why would let you into the thing? I never got the opportunity to meet him in this week, but I can absolutely do that. Would you need to have your aim influence going? That's going to get confusing. Do we really need... I guess it is a little weird that you just have to take it. Unless we just made the doors open as soon as you collect the ticket.  Well, the idea is that the kiosk just refuses to sell you the ticket because you're Mario and the tickets then is Mario. Oh, something is wrong with the coin formation. The doors are magic ticket detectors. Yeah, it would seem that way. But what if the penguins had a secret entrance and they were like looking to recruit help? And as soon as you talk to them, they like let you in the secret entrance. These are the penguins, by the way. Something's wrong with the light on them. Actually, I think that's the light on the level that's wrong. Oh, my God. Yeah, that's way too dark. I see the intention with the blue. Okay. Okay, that's a much nicer shade color here. That looks so much better. Yeah, I prefer this by a lot. So we could have the secret entrance literally anywhere and it could be the boss or just smart penguin and where would the ideal place for this be? Maybe around here, just like a cave entrance. Maybe it would be underwater so that you can't immediately see it. What stops you from going in there without talking to penguins first? Why would they want to escape from the zoo if they can just leave at any point? Fair enough. You already kind of find buried treasure in the form of the ice cap entrance. So I wouldn't want to redo that. Resist and you're doing a last impact all out again and you can't really fix that one. What's wrong with this? I'm not sure I understand. I thought the old world had a really good start so far. Can you specify what you mean by that? Okay. Can I just have a giant door out of nowhere and a bridge to a ship out of nowhere? Okay, but a dock here makes sense, right? And the zoo has to be somewhere on the island. How are you thinking these elements would appear? Okay. I feel like the island is joined by an island instead of actual places on the island. I mean, okay, the ship is just a ship outside the island, right? So you literally just walk at the ship. The zoo would be like behind this thing here. It's like a little walking area. How would you change it though? Okay. Okay, so your change idea is kind of like there would be an entirely separate part with the only thing being in that just being the level entrance. Like a clean cut wall barrier. You think that's necessary? Is that what I'm understanding here? Hmm. Okay. The dock being here, the dock would be like somewhere over here and there would be like a cave or something you enter to get to the dock. Does it need to be a wall barrier or can it just be like a cave that transitions you to a different area? Maybe it's like a dark cave with like a black plane that you walk through. Hmm. Would that do it better in the way you are thinking of? I can see how the feeling would be created that way. Okay. Okay. I can't. Yeah, I see what you mean. Yeah, I think you are correct there. Let's give that a try. Okay. Okay.  I don't know how good Benja really is. What they tried just fundamentally seems unimpressive overworld wise. Like yeah, it follows all the right principles, but the way they did it like obviously it was going to work. I don't know if I'm crazy for saying that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Something just fell in love and adds so much to the vibe. True. Yep, exactly. No, I get you. I get you Biobak. Don't worry. I understand 100% what you mean. And I think I'm agreeing with you. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think I want to boost Cruz it's finished we reckon run around the cliff a bit that would look cool I'm not sure what that means I think the donkey gongs overall this pretty small comparison to what we will do in god send shotgun by accident while messing with minimaps you can mouse over an object and do alt Q to change object without leaving edit mode doesn't work on my end but that sounds like a pretty cool one okay with this going on what if we change all of this to just be colored and we only adding alt Q that's what I tried doesn't do anything it's probably just because we use different keybinds shouldn't be too surprising let me ask this but does having alt falling into one area affect the others like is there a global limit on their room before I hit it in DDD there kind of is a limit but I can work around it with coach and it's probably unlikely that you would hit it you can probably just ignore it okay why the fuck is this covenant fog is this more like what you were thinking Biobak of course it's still too big I agree but like good good good good next mission next mission is figure out how to enter the zoo and then next mission after to just make it smaller you missed the clouds there were never any clouds here do chores for vario hmm like what oh those well they look kind of poopy and then should the fuck all of a sudden appear without any wind or other reasons why that yes the cave will probably get creepy as you go along who's writing me oh shit it's my manager to be an integration with brand red magic that do high-end gaming phones and tablets how will I fit 18 district 30 districts of eight areas is still in it then do it if the original r64 engine has a limit of eight I guess I'm just out of luck nothing I can do okay this is important we need to think about this for a while so doing chores for vario maybe but chores aren't fun and I don't like the idea of helping vario penguin that escaped and tells you to begin I don't know I would have to add a fifth penguin to the gang and that's kind of like retroactive and I don't want the baby penguins to do that a monty mole that you pay to grab a tunnel to dig a tunnel into there I think kind of works someone that just has a ticket and will give it to you for something eh it's too random or is physically blocking the entrance by sending and you make him leave his position somehow that also works pretty well he could be just in his booth normally but if you get too close he just blocks the path and then would say like tickets above here and as soon as you come he's like nope no tickets for you how would you make him leave his path or his post you get a fight a real a whole boss fight in the overworld I don't know about that with a giant garlic hmm and that's what he flees from you because he sees your head and thinks you're coming to catch him when you catch him he's like my family is trapped in there I can't go help them because Mario will catch me but take the tickets save them yourself what would the text be like wow let me go I don't wanna be put in a cage oh you're not putting in me in the cage please help my family they're all caged by that big stinky yellow man here I'll give you this ticket that I saved up for like that I think that works yeah the penguin could just be anywhere around here let's make a note it's a bit too verbose for the game of hearing I think it works and there's also the ice cap area but other than that it's only these two levels here I think that would be cool just seeing him stand here and then as soon as you approach he just instantly blocks the path that would look so funny the penguin or Mario Mario blocks the path the penguin is just running away from you somewhere around here somewhere in the world so we do need a place for the penguin to run away from you yeah the penguin is almost like Mips here should cut the banana in half so you can water in the middle of it that's a funny idea but me it looks nice sure it's so pretty man god I wish my I wish modern games looked this good to look at this penguin can run on the banana penguin can run anywhere and of course we also need the ice cap how about a sim level in the sky where you would race by flying a bird what that's too random hello bombs yeah reminder that the way we're doing this is we're making a rough sketch of what each overworlds geometry will look like and roughly what the texture will be and then we're somewhat cleaning it up right now we're just making like the roughest of rough drafts we don't really care about visuals we only care about designing the gameplay right now so I will not be doing like UV mapping and vertex coloring or whatever that would be an actual waste of time right now because we will definitely go back to this over later on when we go into later overworlds right now the rum is like let's check 59 megabytes the penguin is definitely going to run around like mips but obviously a lot less nimble because he's a stupid penguin why do we make him flee into the water and there's some kind of puzzle to it then you have to figure out I think that could be fun seven-layer puzzle yeah I don't want people to have too much trouble entering the course Oh love that voice line it's such a good one and for this we said likely what we'll do is a large line of rocks oh this is us two and just right next to each other and we're always muxing we already have our mechanism I'm like the penguin we're still kinking out the details of how the penguin exactly will work but I think it's gonna be the penguin you guys have to keep in mind this is like Mario 64 and it's about keeping stuff simple he's given us need to Part 4, which is the back side here, where you will be able to enter the lighthouse. Guys, what does it mean when someone says T.S.? I keep seeing it. Does it mean this shit? You say this shit so much that you need like... It does mean this shit, okay. I fake from context. I feel like we're in an internal cycle of people making up new abbreviations and then people saying, ha ha ha, look how crazy abbreviations I've gotten. This is unintelligible and then people spelling abbreviations and then people making up new abbreviations and then going like, ha ha ha, look how unintelligible this has become. Isn't that funny? Ah, I didn't mean to export the custom one. Sometimes it even just means this, great. Tough shit, not this shit. Can you go over new world so far? I missed basically everything. Okay, okay, let's go over new world. So, this is where you start. Mario is going to arrive here with a boat at the beginning of the game and a cutscene. The cutscene is going to show a camera view kind of like this. So, you see the volcano and the lighthouse and then zoom in on Mario and now you are on the island, ready for action. So, from here, you will see the bunny brushwoods entrance with Peggy Derm, that's the elephant with Yoshi's Island with the stop sign, blocking the entrance. He's going to demand 10 coins of you to unleash the entrance. So, you get there and it's like, okay, well, I can't go in there yet. So, let's go somewhere else on the island. And hopefully, you would end up being here, which is the entrance to course 2. That's the cave part. The cave can go further in, because I know you want separate areas. That's all no issue. And obviously, you can't enter that because you need one star for that. So, what else do we have here? We got this little island off to the side. We got some coral reefs. We got a lonely palm tree island. There's nothing here. But, later on, after you collected a few stars, a message in a bottle will appear and will give you instructions on how to get a secret star around the palm tree. You'll have to do some special action or something. Then, we got this all here. So, hopefully, after you found that, you realize, oh shit, there's coins around. Let me just grab some quick ones, so I can enter course 1. And that's it for overworld 1. After you get 10 coins, you can enter the guy. An alternate way to enter is to just ground pound. That will kick him over, but it won't permanently leave the level entrance open. Yeah, the problem is, I need some kind of gate here. And I think it has to be the coin gate. Because what else are we going to do? We need to force the player to run around the overworld a little bit. There's also going to be, since there's new water controls when you're in water, there's going to be a cheep cheep coming up to you with a sign that has just a quick overview of the water controls with a joystick move. A go up, B go down. So, this is the tutorial area. Well, you don't have to wall jump to get the coins here. It's entirely optional. So, I'm not doing the crash anymore. What was the crash again? See, you can do it with a simple single jump. The crash. Also, of course, during the intro cutscene, Moza is going to put this gate over here, so you can't enter the second part. If they return to each will they get added to your ship for ease of reminder? There's only one, so you can read it as many times as you want, but there's only one. What about a cannon? There's going to be a cannon somewhere up there. That's going to be overworld part 4. And then after you get, I think, 4 or 5 stars, I don't actually remember how many we wanted, you will be able to enter here. And this will lead to part 2, and then part 2 leads to part 3, and this is part 3. So, there's a part in the middle with the entrance to Bozo's first level, and the entrance, of course, is free, but then you get here. For some reason, Mario's will crash on a rock in the distance from the island, so you'll be forced to win swim controls as you reach the island. So, in a way, you can't leave and Mario's boat being repaired will make this a cool secret dungeon to enter. Oh, I see. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. Let me think about that. Do I prefer Mario's boat just crashing, or are you just being able to learn it on your own time? Maybe there's a little much going on in the overworld cutscene if Mario's boat also crashes. That seems so random, right? It's like, why would it happen? Well, before the first overworld here, I had planned to have another small overworld, where you can just walk to your boat. I think a cheep-cheep holding a sign is fun, though. I like it. It'd be nice if we found another overworld on the island, and the screen suddenly just What do we really want to start the game off with, the player having to learn swim controls? Wouldn't it be nicer to just have... I guess it doesn't really make a difference. It just seems kind of random and unnecessary at this point. If we go with the cheep-cheep telling you the controls, I think that's easier. I also kept the water in this area all shallow, because I think the controls are a lot more intuitive in shallow water. Overall, I think this being there or not being there is very minor, but I believe it's better if Mario isn't inconvenienced by his boat crashing. This is where you won't have to learn the swim controls while you're inside the levels, since you're going to run for entrances and almost around. Now, you're automatically going to learn swim controls here. At latest, when you get the message in the bottle, you will want to swim over here, and the cheep-cheep will explain the controls to you. You wouldn't have to learn them in the level. The cheep-cheep just holding up the sign should be enough. That's interesting, how that works.  As long as there's no water, you need to swim to get to course 2. Yeah, that too. You do kind of have to swim to get here. Now, swimming is very different, that's why we have to explain it. It's a random way Yoshi's have been kidnapped. Well, they have a different idea. An alternate idea I had was that there was something you'd have to do in the overworld to open the gate there. I initially thought there would be some platforming to get over there, and then that would open the entrance to course 1. But I couldn't think of anything good. We're not adding a cannon this early in the game. The lighting and rain effects are in course 5. Click Bowser again, then you have to open up a button somewhere or something. But why would Bowser close bunny brush specifically and not like all the levels? I think Pachyderm is fun because they're so stupid and they're just so Yoshi. They're just annoying, you know, they're always just a mild inconvenience. I mean, the elephant, yeah, as far as it goes, that's basically it, Bowser's minion being a door. I think I like the coin gate, especially because it like tutorializes the beginning area where there's no danger, but you have to get familiar with Mario at least a little bit to get the coins. I don't know, I'm kind of happy with how it is right now. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You know, the lighthouse can make the fog go away if the fog is behind the cliff. It's a very strong lighthouse. That's also not behind the cliff. It kind of works if you look at it from here. Makes sense enough to me. Okay.  It's weird that enjoying lightning is such a common thing across humans. I wonder why. And I enjoy it too, but I don't understand why. Yeah, if you swim too far out, invisible wall. Here also, I think invisible wall works. And then sometimes we have something a little less nonsensical like the rock wall here. We need those when there's like another part you can see in the distance. Then we need an actual physical barrier. Thinking Bubba. That could also work. We could have a Bubba whose fin is just like sticking out the water. And he's always like exactly where you are on the nearest point on the bounce. And when you get close, he just eats you. The problem is, what about the ice cap? How are you going to do that? He jumps in. Oh, wait, yeah. He could just be so big that you just enter his mouth. Yeah, I kind of like that. Everyone is going to die to him once with the ice cap on though. I already know. Okay.  Whether you die or get spit out, it's the same thing. They haven't done my ice cap combiner. Dude, I have a note in my to-do list that says import Biobak's ice thing and I forgot what it was. I wanted to do it, but it's on my to-do list. I just have to look through our DMs and figure out again what it was. Right now, when I'm off stream, I'm working on my to-do list and my new features and stuff. I will write down the idea here for that. Place bubbles that become visible near the level borders that have their mouths open and you just kind of swim into them if you try to escape. Let's go. Hello, man is cap 2. Piranha shows up under you with the ice cap. Yeah, I don't remember that, but I'll see. That is true, T10. The piranhas would be terrible, but the bubba is very telegraphed. You can see the bubba from far away when you're closer. That's the large difference here.  Dude, I hate this instrument from Skyward Sword. Shut the fuck up. Anyone else feel that way? The harp from Skyward Sword where you just play the same note ladder up and down over and over. Come on, you guys can't tell me you like that. You made it annoying by singing like that? You can't tell me you like this. Man doesn't enjoy a good whatever this is. A good C door. All the notes in the C door tone ladder bordered by frequency over and over. Okay. There's one more thing we need for this overworld. First of all, this needs to be not fucking flat and boring. But second of all, we also need to make the ice cap entrance. Now, in the original second part of the overworld, the ice cap entrance was... You would be told a hint by someone that you can find the ice cap by ground pounding a specific spot. But that Yoshi would only come out after you already beat the first Bowser. So, since you need the ice cap to unlock course 5, maybe someone else should give you that hint? I don't know. From the pillars. And that's a good thing. It's marked by the pillars.  See, originally, you were finding a seashell and then shrinking into the seashell kind of like the Big Boss Haunt entrance. Well, actually, exactly like the Big Boss Haunt entrance. ... ...  ...   It used to tell you something like go to the big pond and then do three backflips and then a ground pound. You know, like a treasure map would tell you that. But the message in the bottom was instead for the ice cap. That would work, but I need an event to happen in the first overworld. So if we did that, then we also need to change the event happening here. I kinda like that. I kinda like moving the bottle cap event to... Yeah, I think that's a good one. ... ... ... We need a different event here then, though. I want there to be an overworld event here to set the expectation for the player that the overworld is very dynamic. I want them to feel like the overworld is alive right away. Now, the mice have nothing to do with it. The mice wouldn't know shit like that. ... Probably like 10,000 kill.  Something like that. Maybe more. Maybe like 11. With new X3 features it's probably gonna increase even more. Cooking stream? I don't cook. ... ...    Gym stream happens sometimes on accident. Fisherman coming into the dock. Hmm.  ... ... Maybe. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...    ...  ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ...   ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
