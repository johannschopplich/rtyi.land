Hello Selton, hello Mel, hello Simon, hello Giorgias, hello everyone, hello everyone, hello Giorgias, hello Warframe Sensei, hello everyone, what's up, I'm making an instructional guide for the game. Um, no, well let me know if that's something you're going for, maybe. What am I working on? We are currently, or today, going to be working on this KV part here. Sorry I'm a little distracted, my dad is riding me on my phone right now. We had a little vandalism attack in my grandfather's house. So, we're going to be working on that. In what country? In Germany. It looks like someone went into his house and turned on all the water to destroy his house. Yeah, that sounds about right. Dude, where's my sound? Am I deaf? There we go. So, these are the crystals we are going to program. We're going to make it so that while you carry one of these crystals, otherwise invisible forms are going to become visible and polidable. Let me just think about the best way to do that. Hmm. This is actually kind of a difficult problem that I didn't think about before. So, the thing is, we could make one generic platform that shows up as you get closer, but obviously if we duplicate the mesh, then it's going to be showing other platforms as well. Please don't try to make a tree like in Star Revenge. I'd rather you just quit making models right now. I do not want to look at a tree that looks like the ones in Star Revenge. Thank you. Sorry, I was a bit mean. But I'm serious. I was a bit mean, but that came from my heart. Yeah, so what if we have two platform designs? Like one thick one and one long one or something. And then we can simply make the one that is further away fully invisible at all times. Ah, that doesn't work either. Because what if you have a crystal placed in a good spot? That wiggles whenever he falls like that. Auto-attack chess? That's not a real thing. Any OSD wishes for today? Thank you. I liked HUM3, what about HUM4? Let me look at what HUM is again. I don't think I like this one. You know what, Astro Bot OSD, why not? The game of the year? Is it actually a good game? Or was it just a stupid marketing thing? Damn ignored. Calculating entry at different quantization steps seems to work really well. Yeah, make sure to hack into the mainframe when you revertortize the vertex coordinates. But you get where I'm coming from, right? This stupid shit made no sense to me. Is there an amusing app on streams? Nope. Yes, Ben, that's the idea. So what we could do is make a path. What if we just make one long path here? A path is just always collisionable but not visible. I think that is the idea. You're attending a live? To be honest, it just isn't very memorable to me. I do not remember the HUM3 OSD at all. Damn Leela, you're famous from the Bob-omb video! Is that the real Leela from the Bob-omb video? You think he's Estrobot? I don't know man, let's keep listening. Maybe he'll tell us whether he's Estrobot. I don't know. Scientific explanation for what she did? A little bit of bullshit. I got a lot of comments about the Leela section of the Bob-omb video. People thought it was really funny, the petting animation. Yeah, we gotta think of a design for these platforms that only show up when you have the thing. I'm actually kinda iffy on it. Let's just try something. Did you? I only saw one calling me a dude but I haven't been checking. Oh yeah, there were a lot of transphobic comments. They were like, oh okay, a woman in ROM making. I never expected that. Nevermind, I just saw the flag. I got a lot of comments like that. But also I got a lot of comments being like, wow the petting animation is so funny. Sorry, close the stream Alexa, what did you say? I said, yes, I did get a lot of transphobic comments. You are correct. But there were also comments saying that they thought the animation was very funny. And that it looked like side distance feels and stuff like that. There were more positive comments than transphobic comments about you. I'll say that much. I also got quite a few people that wanted to implement the optimization I mentioned in that video. Which is very exciting. Unfortunately, a lot of the inquiries I got about that were a little bit rubbish. Yeah, I'm still talking to the camera. I'm not sure he understands the mission. Which is very unfortunate. Because he does seem very motivated to help. But I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to be rude and be like, everything you just said is wrong. But also, I don't feel like I'm going to get anywhere. This is kind of an interesting visual. I don't remember either. Okay. Why did it go black? No longer black. Let's see, how does that look like? I don't want to click on it, because people are going to be mad at me. Okay. Wait, what? Am I getting crap for the boop sound? Let me check this out. Are we getting hate on here? He likes it. I mean, that's a relatively positive one. I turned up the sound for the purpose of the video. Is it an option to stop it? Okay, that's unfortunate. I'm definitely not adding an option. I disagree. The original sound is more distracting. I'll give a few decibels of the treble. I agree. This guy is correct. I didn't know that it was very distracting, so I will look into making it less distracting. This one is complete garbage. I am not adding options for everything. And then I didn't understand this. Be brave to take commercial steps? How is it brave to add options? I see what he means. Yeah, he could be correct. If the goal is variety in what you hear, we could add random pitch shifts to it. I'm not sure about stretching the sound. This is a clash of two ideals. The first one is that you get the variety when you spam it. And the other is that it's less sound. A rocket robot on wheels is a disgrace. That's an evil comment. This is a crazy idea. I like it. I like it. I don't think I'm getting too much shit here. The generator is very loud, so I'm changing it. Yeah. No, it's not Rookie. They are just a species in this game. Where else is this used in Mario Galaxy? The Ghost Galaxy? Monty Paltz Galaxy? Oh, that's what they do. How do we make a distinct looking floor here? It looks like it's being shown by the crystal. That's the question. 3D world appearing path? That looks like a bot. This? Yup. Thank you for the bits. Why do we have to check the bot? I think I need to add tilescrolls. This is definitely not what I want. Giving it a bit of a wobbly effect could work. Okay. We are definitely adding new original enemies. Dang, Zayna, that sucks. I don't know what I'm doing here. Is there a way I can use the falling of Alpha to make it so that when the Alpha falls off, it looks like there's a line? I think that would be great if we could get that to work somehow. Yo, thank you for the 4 month sub! I'm sorry if I miss subs like 90% of the time. I don't know what's going on. Okay. I have a crazy idea if this works. Let me think about this. We need a combiner that takes the Alpha input and when the Alpha falls off to 0, it does some weird shit. And that weird shit is, there's a line. That line can be blending to white or it can be blending to black. I actually do not care. The main thing I care about is that there is visibly a line. So, if we take the shade color Alpha and we pitch it up a little bit to just before 1.5. Now it's gonna get clamped to 1 and we have already shrunk the range. Next we need to make it so that the range goes up even more. We can only do that in Cycle 2 Alpha here. What can we actually do here? The vertex colors cannot be sharp like that now. I meant per face corner. Oh yeah, that can be sharp. Yeah, that's no problem. What even is going on here? Right, ow, this is weird. It's black? Why is it black? That seems like an error. I don't see why it would go to black. I don't see why it would go to black. That's not quite what we need either. Hello there, Fortschritt. Hello there, Fortschritt. True. Get caught? What do you mean get caught? No one should want me to get caught. This is nonsense. Why is it nonsense? Why is this all bullshit? There's no way it renders like this, right? It shouldn't. How could it ever render like this? Hello, Autodidact. You were in timeout? Did you get auto-timeouted? What would happen if you catch Nintendo's IR right now? Like, if they got mad at me and tried to CND me, then I would have to remake Yoshi's Island without Mario. No! I want the opposite of this. I wonder why the edge is actually... But also I don't like how... I don't like how fake this is. What's wrong with the UbiCorns? Nothing. We're just trying to make a shader right now that actually does what we want. Basically there's going to be a bridge that appears, and it's going to appear via vertex colors. So we're going to be setting the vertex colors here appropriately to make it slowly appear over time. But it's not working as intended right now. Or, well, I mean it is working as intended, but it doesn't look good. We need to make it look good. That's our mission right now. So we're looking at inspiration for what this could look like, and we're looking for a combiner we can set up. There was a guy that joined my Discord recently who was like, Casey, you need to stop posting about your thing. Have you guys ever watched that video of, like, fangame creators need to shut the fuck up? I hate that video so much. This is the dumbest video. Yeah, it's this. This fucking idiot. What is his name? Yeah, this. Fuck this guy. This is the dumbest video. He posted that and I was like, Casey, you need to stop posting about RTYI. Nintendo is going to make you homeless. Nintendo is going to make you homeless. It will happen. Nintendo can just pick out any one person out of the population they want and make them go homeless. God, it annoyed me. The mentality behind it is so stupid. Like, okay, what do you gain out of not posting about your game? Think about it for a second. What is the difference between Nintendo sending you a DMCA or a CMD and you never having posted about your game in the first place? How do these practically change your world? Well, if Nintendo DMCAs you, you can't post about your game. If you don't post about your game, you're not posting about your game. What's the difference? You said you will release it out of nowhere and it will be archived? Why do you need to release it out of nowhere for it to be archived? Why can you not announce your release and then have it be archived? I don't think the money component really influences the tickdowns that much. It doesn't get you pursued beforehand, it's dumb. Okay, look at the Mario 64 decomp, they just released it anonymously on 4chan. How is that different from just releasing it without ever announcing it? There are projects that have been DMCA'd or CMD'd by Nintendo and then they didn't release. But there have also been projects that have been CMD'd or DMCA'd by Nintendo and then released. In fact, if we looked at them in comparison and we compared products that have been CMD'd or DMCA'd by Nintendo to projects that haven't, and we tried to use that to predict whether they are going to release, we would notice that the predictive power of that is really low. This is because fangames almost never get released. And the CMD itself at most is going to be an excuse or a reasoning people use for why it didn't happen. But it's probably not very related. Anyway, we gotta work on this shader here. We just need an appearing path and a video gap. I find my own video when I google it. I mean this is a pretty sick effect. I actually do like this a lot. What if we used a crystal texture for that? What if we had like a crystal pattern, like a diamond pattern? Don't we have that on the rainbow level? Do we do the same thing we did on the rainbow level here? Let me take a look at that. Hello VoidPilot. Hello VoidPilot. Right, that just fucking crashes when I open it, I forgot about that. Okay. Romhacks are kind of a grey zone right now. And... Nintendo revels in that grey zone. They know no one wants to risk being sued by them. Because, you know, that would be very expensive for them. At least as far as Romhacks go. And... Think about the risk. Right now... You sue a fangame creator. You win. It's like, okay, basically everything stays exactly the way things were. Like, people don't really make many bootlegs. And stuff like China. They don't really monetize them that much. But imagine you lose. If you lose that, like, you're completely fucked. Like, forever. It's over, actually. I think the risk vs reward is just not worth it for Nintendo. And that's why nothing is ever going to happen. So... Not mix and matching Fast64 versions. I should have turned Fast64 off so I could open this level here. Because this level has a stupid bug. Where if Fast64 is on when you open the level, it crashes. And that is not my fault. It's Fast64. I'll be honest, man. If Nintendo does take me down... That is probably the best thing that could happen to me. Because then I would have an excuse to not have this be a Mario 64 hack anymore. I could just be like, okay, well, clearly we're not allowed to develop this as a Mario 64 hack. We're now instead making my own IP out of it. And I would probably make a lot more money that way. Hello, Chaosites. Yes. Will I be able to release the game with the Mario 64 that remains still? Yes. I'm planning to get to 0% Nintendo code. If I got properly C&D'd, it is true that I would have to remove Mario from the game. And goombas and stuff like that. Oh, I actually kinda don't like how there isn't a hard engine. Why is Blender so slow? It takes like 4 seconds to do anything right now. Do you see that? Let's try Fast64 Render again. Is that right? I'm gonna get mad at that. I'm not a therapist. That isn't my responsibility. Using Vulkan Blender? I don't know, man, I'm using Blender. And Fast64 Render can't render this thing at all, so what am I to do? Oh my gosh, please let me use Blender. Maybe there's unused data here? That we can delete? Do you see how long everything takes? I actually cannot use Blender right now. You should buy a better computer? I'm done upgrading my computer. Make software better. Go to the Blender settings? Why? Oh, for our Vulkan. Where is that? Probably in edits. Any time now? And then preferences? Any time now? Why would it be viewport? Please just tell me why this, I don't want to navigate this. Preferences system. I don't see Vulkan option in here. I don't see Vulkan option in here. Go to backend? I don't see backend. I don't see backend. Generally, I've never had this bad of an experience with Blender. Blender? Maybe this is Linux Project 64 also? We can close that I suppose. This is so bad, holy shit. I think this is a diamond-ish texture, but not quite diamonds. Okay, this is what it looks like. Is there a feature to make a game where the notes pitch shift up a major scale? I wonder if you could do that with the loop to make it sound fun. A major scale? I don't know, but random? Maybe. Major scale seems way too much. Or do you mean like if you use it in a row, it slowly shifts up? That does sound pretty fun. Is Blender 4.5 not 4.2? Ah, okay. Blender. I wonder if this Trapisode is any good. We'll find out in 4-5 business days. 4-5 business days. 4-5 business days, ayy. That looks kinda ass. Yeah, I think I want a different pattern. Boop boop boop boop boop boop. I think that's enough. What if we use this beautiful god-race as the texture? And then we aligned it in the right way? That would kind of be a cool effect, don't you think? If it did this, like, continuously? What do you think? Oh, we could have it like this. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Basically the same thing. Let's do that then. Have you seen Tiny3D videos? Yes. There is a chance. Very slim chance, I will not say anything about it, that I will do a project on Tiny3D. But no guarantees. Do you mean Doriel's thing? Yes, I talked to Doriel a fair bit. There is a good chance I will use her technique as well. Also that technique is going to be a lot more optimized than my engine, because I have collision BVH. She does not. So, the way she has to do collision kind of fucking sucks. Whereas I can use the BVH to find the triangles. Yeah, it's going to be basically free on RTYI. Barely more expensive than a normal shadow. But before we do that, I want to show you something. But before that, there is a few other things I want to make happen. That is, one, I want to reduce Mario to 15 bones. He is currently 20 bones, because of Nintendo's stupid animation conversion. And Sauron and me talked about a new format for armatures, that would save a lot of time. So if that goes through, I want that in first. Because I don't want to rework Mario's armature twice for this. I would be on Linux, if I didn't need Windows for work. Do you think Linux would need less than 4 seconds per button press and render? That would be great. This looks bad, because it's one stiff shape and one swooply shape, you know what I mean? I can't combine those. AI is pretty good at making 64x64 text. Are we having this conversation again? I don't think it is. We've tried it before, it was pretty awful. But just show what you use? I don't know, I meant a good one, I guess. The end of the end always means the end of the beginning? False. What if there is a bridge? Or a middle part? What could we even use? Maybe something special like this? Meow, meow, meow. Meow, meow, meow. No, I don't like this texture. It's probably a good water texture, now that I think about it. Okay, maybe water texture is the wrong move. Unless we use a simpler one. Any day now, man. Leela, is there a new version of Fast64 Render that maybe I can use? The amount of lag I have to deal with is just not sustainable. So, I think if we did something like this, that would work. It kind of has an interesting look to it. I didn't even know you had to pay for Windows licenses. I thought they gave you Windows for free, but then just put spyware into your computer, and then that's all you pay. A.D.E.? What's A.D.E.? Okay, we need to find a better way to tile this. To tessellate this, rather. Also, I think we should get rid of the below part here. Doesn't really help with the visuals. I see, I see. I see. For me, the biggest threat of switching up Windows is that I literally just need Windows for work. How would you tessellate something like this? What if I just overlap a hexagon, and then we see how that looks? That's not awful, I think. The hexagon tessellation. How would you tessellate something like this? How would you tessellate something like this? How would you tessellate something like this? How would you tessellate something like this? That's fucked up. How did I... Why did I do that? What the hell? How did I do it that wrong? That's better. I know it's estimated, but that's fine. I'm gonna make Windows for free. See exactly what I mean. They can do that. They work off the spyware they give you. So now, when we paint the vertices black, it should do this. And then we can have this effect here, with the scrolling. I think that works. That looks ghostly and mysterious. I have so many free Xbox Live clips when I'm watching Xbox games. My concept is easy to understand, but I understand why you'd want to not want that. I don't think we have case 44, do we? Yeah. Why is this a zero entry here? We're just gonna overwrite it. That's...  Hello, Twi'lel. Hello, Twi'lel. I have completely reworked Miro Mario. You guys have no idea what I did the last few days, actually. I didn't even tell you guys. I was working on going through all the source code again, and removing every piece of Nintendo code. I probably should have mentioned that earlier, when we were talking about Nintendo legal stuff. So, right now, I'm going through every single file again, and I'm deleting every function I find, and I'm re-implementing this from scratch, basically. And doing that, I find a lot more really small optimizations for all the random systems. So far, I found every function that wasn't written by me, roughly on average, like a 30% reduction in size. So, we're going to save a few kilobytes of memory. We're gonna make the systems a little easier to work with, and maybe we'll find a few more percentage points in performance. Let me actually show you right now the performance we have. You might remember that the last time I showed the game, we were at like 50.02 FPS or so, in Area 1, Overworld 1. I think we are slightly better now. Keep in mind, this is with Asserts on, and with the Profiler taking 800 frames. So the real FPS is going to be a lot higher than what's going to be shown here. Let's see what we get. 50.3! Pretty fuckin' good. I booted Krita, and it was just like, DeviantArt, BlueSky, BlueSky, DeviantArt, BlueSky, BlueSky... I think that's all I saw. Let's see what we get. Let's see what we get. Let's see what we get. Wait, where's my behavior address thing? Oops. This is what I wanted, right? This is what I wanted, right? Let's see, we need the path to go up here next. I didn't actually think about how to achieve the path here. Windows 10... I don't actually know if they can really do that. Like, make it so that Windows 10 is no longer supported. Isn't that going to be disastrous for humanity as a whole? Because all of a sudden, you will have security exploits, and no one is going to be there to help anyone. I don't know, there's going to be a lot of old people that will lose all their money, which honestly... might not even be that bad of a thing. Actually, that would be terrible. I mean, evidently not. I feel like at that point, the government has to bribe Microsoft to keep supporting Windows 10 or something. I mean, clearly it's not Microsoft's issue, right? They already did the Windows 10 1.0 security updates? I thought it was deprecated in October or something. Windows XP? I don't know man, Windows XP that seems... I don't know if I believe that. Isn't at this point Windows XP so old that you get hacked if you just connect to the internet? This sounds like a song straight out of Mario. This song is stolen right? Which Mario song Let me just... What if we make this go in a zig-zag pattern? I think that might be the best option here. It's really weird, it's the path that Beth had, but it'd be Byzantine. I don't understand. What the hell is Byzantine? Wait, what the fuck am I doing? This is nonsense. That works. Goodbye Islands. Chocolate mud cake? What's mud cake? Sounds tasty. Or disgusting actually. I'm 50-50 on this. Okay. I kinda don't like how far you have to go. We should shorten this somehow. Remove the last secret crystal here. I don't like that there's a whole extra piece. I'm removing And then I think all we need to do... Wait, we don't even need this one anymore. You can just do this with one crystal now. Okay, that works. Okay. Oh shit, I should have separated this into a different thing. Oops. What the hell is Chatty and Nya thinking about? Don't I already have the code for this? Where's the rainbow? Fuck up riches. Very similar to this. I'm gonna be Jade. Okay. And Shadow. Wait, what? Why is that an issue here but not in the other place? Weird. Okay, now the path should be appearing and disappearing with Mario instead of the crystal. And then next we just need to change the target object. Cool. Didn't work at all. Cool. I didn't place the object actually, that's probably why. Oh, I placed that, I see. That's strange that that didn't crash, but okay. Okay, it's so slow. Oh yeah, I have a new chair. Look at this. You can do this. It's actually very cozy. This is a very good chair. The YouTube sponsor gave it to me. And I'm not saying who, because I'm not giving them free advertisement. It's still not working? Oh, it's doing the opposite, it's fading out around Mario. How did I fuck that up? Oh no! I mean, it is kind of a cool effect. I guess the fast 64p view is just extremely inaccurate. Damn. Or is it? Let me analyze the code. But it's also rendering even with complex colors, right? It's rendering with min alpha, I guess is the thing. Oh, and the max alpha is set to. Okay, I see. So we need to modify this slightly. Makes sense. This is the first stream I've had where I'm just being ignored by chat. That's actually kind of crazy. What are people even doing here? They're just chatting about Linux and ignoring me. Fine by me. I don't need attention. Hmm, still not quite what I want. I think it's probably because the texture doesn't the way we need it. true. It is kind of a cool effect. But it's not quite perfect. When I find a tuna shank. Oh no. It is a very cool effect. And then we make it start around the crystal. special. Exactly. That's the tuna shank. 100 for the hitbox seems really big. That can't be right to me. I'm not installing Linux on stream. That sounds awful to do. I don't think the zoobanana is ever used. I'm not installing Linux on stream. That sounds awful to do. I'm not installing Linux on stream. That sounds awful to do. I'm not installing Linux on stream. texture on 1.8.7.7 texture on 1.8.7.7 texture on 1.8.7.7 fair enough fair enough fair enough fair enough Hello Sarah, it's going pretty well. We likely just finished the crystal thing. We likely just finished the crystal thing. Whoops. Wow, wow, wow. Wow, wow, wow. Wow, wow, wow. Wow, wow, wow. A brainwave reading headband? That's kind of cool. That's kind of cool. No path shows right now, so we might have to make this a little bit bigger. And it's not... And it's not... What's going on there? Secret path crystal? Obj list default is bad I think. Obj list default is bad I think. I think it needs to be an obj list level. Can't interact, yeah. Can't interact, yeah. Well, no wonder it didn't work. Do we have our intangible timer? Do we have our intangible timer? We do. Anything else? Last core? Back to subtract variable core. Bitbox seems fine. Graph Y offset? Where's my graph Y offset? There used to be a graph Y offset here. I guess I deleted it when I copied code. Oh boy, crashes. Nah, they're all good. I had to deal with a lot of crashes earlier. I was working on making instant warps work with my new system. And they do work now, it's now a lot easier to do instant warps in Rty. I don't know what that was. Must have turned around or something. Oh, my controller has a weird thing where sometimes Mario just looks forward after I let go. That's why that happens. It mostly works, but it goes invisible, which is a problem. Okay, medicine seems to be slightly bigger, but other than that, I think we're good. Yes, exactly, that's the idea. Why would I do that? Hi from Chaos, that's me. That's how you know me? That's crazy. It's Mr. Beast. Mr. Beast from Chaos Edition. What's it supposed to be? It's supposed to be like a crystal. Still needs a little bit of a glow. Apart from the jitter, I think this is decent. Let's see if it respawns as intended. Oh, respawn? I really don't think we need this, this was only for the amplifier. Yes, definitely, let's make it light up Mario. Let's first add the glow and then make it light up Mario, how about that? There, secret path was done. Yeah, yeah, no, I definitely, I had already planned to put a glow behind them. I just hadn't done it yet. The first important one was just like a rough thing. Yeah, that's animation almost done, very nice. Bro, my PC is dying, what is going on? Why does everything take so long? I'm gonna go crazy. They are tangible even when not visible. This is due to technical limitations mostly, but it's fine. I don't think it changes the gameplay of this too much. Yeah, it's probably gonna look cool in speedruns. What the fuck? Ctrl C, Ctrl Z, Ctrl C, Ctrl Z, Ctrl V. Okay, well, good enough. Is this going to properly work? It works, cool. It's a nice changer. I don't know what that looks like. It looks tasty, nice. You like to hear it. Now it's got a glow. Okay, Mario is a little enthusiastic about this. Get my crystal. Look at that. Doesn't respawn, has no fraction. Those are the two issues. The no respawn part, I do not understand at all. Let's investigate what's happening with the respawn. We should also investigate what's happening with the jitter. The respawn is based on how far away it is from its initial location in the level and whether Mario is holding it. Right, and I also need to do this. Right now, for some reason, when you go through an area and then back, the game just crashes, which is something that broke during my refactors that I definitely need to fix. So now I've made it so that if it is too far away from where it initially was, which it is right now, then it will eventually despawn. Clearly, it does not think it is away from home. Why not? How does this make sense? That's actually not possible. What I am seeing right now is just not possible. I am living in a crazy illusion. Takashi used the Sharingan on me and now I live in a bad dream. Huh? It's distant from home? M2144080176? That doesn't sound right. It was an implicitly declared function. And GCC didn't warn me. Even though I have the warning for implicitly declared functions explicitly turned on, it did not warn me of that. What is this? That's a weird spot to have. What is this? That's a weird spot to have. Still gotta get rid of that one. Auf Wiedersehen, Sarah. I don't think I need the debugging anymore. Zero is a good number. That's what it should be right now. Okay, that looks much better. Nice. That is what we want. It also appears to have friction now, but not underwater. Maybe not. But that's fine, that's a problem for object step, which is not a function I'm a fan of anyway. Maybe when I get rid of that, in favor of just one object stepping function for everything. Can I do this blind? I can. I think it's gonna be pretty easy for speedrunners to do this blind. They're probably just gonna go up here. Probably don't even have to go there. They can just... Wait, you can just do that. Okay, that's a bit lame. You don't even interact with the secret path. That's too much. No. You're gonna have to interact with the secret path. If you're skipping the secret path by knowing where it is, fine. If you skip the secret path by not even interacting with it, I'm not fine with that. I'm moving this over here. That's probably going to be fine. Makes this blind for the overworld? Around 40 in total. Side levels included. Out of 3 stars, maybe like 15. We currently have 5 in. Am I gonna get a non-straight line from the stone platform? I don't think it really matters that much. Anyway, I think that star is done for now. The path might still change with Biobank later, so I'm not too worried about it. That completes the first 4 parts, I think. I suppose you can only see up. Go to the star. We got it. We don't have the lighter song, that's fine. Expectable 1, we have that. Re-entrance, we have that. R2's Bowser level? I don't see how that's related. That's definitely not part of this. Yeah, this is done. We are now done up until part 5. That means the first overworld is all good. Next we need to decorate this a little bit with characters and actors. We want a bunch of Yoshis to be around after you beat the first Bowser. So that will be the Yoshi villagers. We only have a few seagulls. I think I'm adding some spiders as well. I think I'm adding some grasshoppers. Maybe some butterflies. Some fields of flowers. Stuff like that. Our next goal will be to polish up the first overworld. I already bug-fixed the ice cap. I'm right now bug-fixing the first Bowser level. Once that is all done, I will ship it to one beta tester and he gets to test all 5 levels. But yes, that will be for a different time. For now, I am done with streaming. I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye!
