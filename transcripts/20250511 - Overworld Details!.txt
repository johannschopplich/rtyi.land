Hello? First, no, me. Hello? Hello? I'm blind. Where's overworld all? Here. First in chat? Fine. Hello, Kelsight the lion. Hello, Joe Enderman. Oh wow, so you're accidentally watching my stream? Gee, thanks. I feel like I finally have my freedom back. I had so much stuff to do the last couple days, that I couldn't do anything I wanted to do. And now I'm back into, or almost back into, I can just do what I want mode. We really need this fast 64 box fixed. Let us blend. We will blend today. Hello, silver dust. So our goal today is to find shaders for this app. I think I like the rock transition here. Looks pretty cool. Well, the rendering area is really bad. We also wanted some plants added. Dude, I recently started importing some of Badub's sound effects. Now that the sound engine is completely remade, we can add some sound effects everywhere. And look at this, I love this. It adds so much. Do you hear it? Probably not. It's a thing you perceive, but don't realize you perceive. But then when I'm here, you can hear it maybe? The little propeller sound makes it feel so much more alive to me. And same with the windmill. You hear it? I don't know what that means.  Uh-oh. But you get the idea. Is the song different now? The song is new. It has the main theme of the game in it now. Any OST wishes for today? Does it look like N64? It's pretty high quality. Tropical Freeze OST? Let's do it.  Someone commented on my video today asking if I had meat with pan and coke and then deleted their comment. I wonder what gave them that impression or why they deleted their comment. Seems extremely sus to me. I stream on both YouTube and Twitch. I think Twitch is better for watching? I don't know, I prefer YouTube for watching actually. But I understand the preference either way. Okay, we have an issue here that we need to blend into this rock here. I guess the blends can happen any way we want. But we should pick something for the top of the mountain here because this looks horrid. Hello Skyloft. Finals in three days. The concept of finals always makes me think someone is still in high school. No more classes till fall? Wow, that's nice. Of course you can student that. That's so funny you mentioned that. Because my next video is titled why the N64 was so blurry. And I go over exactly that. I finished grabbing all the assets for the next video. It will soon be uploaded. Are you guys enjoying the bi-weekly upload rate right now? You think it's good the way I'm doing my YouTube channel? Would you prefer me to not upload as much nonsense? Which, okay, maybe you're not perceiving what I upload as nonsense. I am kind of perceiving it as nonsense. But it is what does well on YouTube. I'm working on a homebrew with a lab dragon. I can say it's defiantly a lot more difficult than working with R64. I imagine. Well, probably setting up the engine is a lot more difficult. But then after you pass that, I imagine it gets a lot easier. Because you don't have to deal with Mario 64's stupid bullshit. The light is now not yellow and red anymore. Nope, the bug is still there. Let's check in the Fast64 forum to see if they fixed it. Or if they did anything about it. Nope. I was just told to do something different. As long as the quality is great, what's the problem with my videos? It takes away time from me working on stuff. Like my game. I'd say that's the biggest issue. Hello. Hello, lion voice. I don't know. The floating hands, I don't get it. Hello, Joe Enderman, welcome back. Hello, Asko. Do I like making videos? No, I hate making videos. But it's good money.  Is the World Freeze Entrance right there or does that lead to the cave in the hub? This right here is World Freeze Entrance. I don't know. Also, we finally got the first beta test for Course 4. It seems the course is on the right track. The testers liked it more than I thought they would. So that's good. There's only one issue with bugs. Obviously, first test there would be a bug. That's one very frustrating bug, but I kept getting softlocked. And the plane mission sucks. So we need to think of something new for the plane mission here. And I discussed this with Vileback already and I think we have a decent idea to damage control it. You can really shmoop in this game, holy shit. Oh! Yeah, unfortunately I am a real human in the real world and I do need to collect money to survive. I know it sucks. I wish I could just say fuck it and only work on my hacks too. I'm going to wrap my head around the idea that this is supposed to be Unreal Hardware and set up with it. Yeah, it all works on Unreal Hardware. I think large videos like Benji was possible on it without frog if you do heavy looting and culling. I don't know. Honestly. There are so many people you're going to meet that are going to just claim it's possible or claim it's not possible with absolutely no knowledge about it. Just talking out of their ass. So just don't listen to them. Just try it, I guess. Just try it. People love talking out of their ass about things they don't understand. Okay, guys, my next video is why the N64 was so blurry. And I want to test my talking out of people's ass theory. Why do you guys think the N64 was so blurry? And how sure are you about this? This is important data for the video, so do not feel ashamed to just answer something. So the new GAMI interview, it was quite cool, but mostly the same question from the old Unreal. True. And I guess it's really fun though. Okay, try it sometime. I promise you'll enjoy. When I do an uneducated guess, I always preface it by saying something like I think or probably or something like that. I'm too careful to always be objectively correct. Although I don't manage to always be objectively correct, I have to admit. Because of the TVs. Okay. He's like a man with five fingers on each hand. True. They use less than a mass texture resolution frequently and they used bilinear filtering aggressively. Okay, yeah, yeah, this is also true. I actually found seven different mechanics that lead to blur. It can be on purpose to save performance and look better on CRT. I think PSX games had something like resolution too. But was the texture cache really an issue? That is kind of a good question. Because I think most people are going to say yes, that is the reason it's so blurry. But then think about it, the PlayStation 1 had like two kilobytes of texture cache. And no one's complaining that that one's blurry. Is that really a good reason? I don't know. Sure. Yeah. I think anti-aliasing is like an important aspect of it, yes. Okay. Okay. Because of the limited RAM bars. Wow, that's putting it really vague, right? You might as well say the N64 is blurry because the big bang happened, you know? It's not the Y we're looking for. Hello, Rocketman. Have you ever heard of Paint 3D? I have heard of Paint 3D, but I never used it. Did you code your own anti-aliasing for this? No. Anti-aliasing is in hardware. Doing it manually would be so incredibly laggy that you wouldn't be able to play games on the N64. At least I don't see a way to make it any less laggy than that. Yeah, the N64 had a much more stable picture. That's because, as I was saying, they didn't use the biggest texture and the best texture performance because it was hard to cram it through RAM. Honestly, I have no idea why they didn't use the highest resolutions available at all times. That kind of seems like a crazy oversight to me. Because texture resolution is really cheap. I don't know. Loading a 32x32 texture is like 15 microseconds. And going to... 64x64... By 32 is like 30 microseconds, so you're sacrificing 15 microseconds, which in the grand scheme of things really isn't much. Oversight or crosscutting? Oversight. I don't think drawing a 64x32 is much more expensive than drawing a 32x32. I just don't see it. Consistency? What do you mean by consistency here? Consistency. So there's two reasons for the N64's blurriness I see no one talk about. The first one is the N64 hardware de-dithering. That one added a lot of blur. And the second one is the disk space. I think the N64's small disk space was a huge reason of blur. Because without limited disk space you could, you know, do the thing where you cut a texture into many, many parts. Hello Condequa. You've had a game of the Narcissus, but I mean, you haven't played the game yet. My game could be complete dogshit that just looks nice, right? I mean, I hope it's not. WGN is saying, unfortunately, I have to log on with Z-Buffer. What? The Z-Buffer is just a deb-buffer. Yo, did the cat just get assaulted in this song? Did anyone else hear that? There! There's a cat getting hit in the song. They used the cat getting hit in the song as an instrument. Since I'm pushing modern version of Dark Corp Engine 2, yes, way more. It's not even comparable. And then the song is going meow meow meow. What is this song? Grass, Dime, Roof. Is this level full of cats? Am I just insane? Meow meow meow meow meow. Meow meow meow meow meow. Meow meow meow meow meow. Meow meow meow meow meow. No idea what I had. Actually, it was my YouTube stats. You guys don't need to see those. Let's go! That's fine to me. I think there should be some kind of hue transition at the top. Did I make the smooth transition between grass and dirt texture? You mean here? This is a decal with Red X Alpha. It just fades in. A transparent decal. That's what they're called. Yeah, I think they should be blueish at the top. This song is some Lion King bullshit. What the hell? Why does it keep going through this mode? Zimba is born. Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze? No, I have not. It would probably be easier to port Co-op Deluxe to this game than the other way around. But people are definitely going to try to port this to the PC port and they're going to fail. Like they do with all my hacks. Does it make the hex check when it's using opacity using this method with your method case? No. Hello, Crystal. This level is planned to be put on the recombination, yes. Which is what you are describing, the good PC port. I'm going to tell Lyska about this. They just look stunning. They're alright. They're going to look a lot better once Firebike has gotten his hands on this. Meow, meow he says. Ha! Hey, that seems to work. I told Lyska that she had now called Serico just the good PC port and her only response was let's go. Fair enough. This is good propaganda. That's an interesting question that you asked of the size of Dolphin because I got tired of people asking that question. So, I have started. One second. Let me get the right link here. This is annoying. Let me open this in a little window to see if this works. Yes, here we go. Look at this. I put out an RTYI progress tracker. So, right here. If you guys really want, I did this yesterday. You can see how far along the game is. So, you see, like, course 1 is 100%, 90, 100, 96, 98, 75, 75, 98, 95, 95, 96, 75, 75. So, we're basically done with most stuff. So, if you want to track progress in RTYI, you can look at this spreadsheet. I'm probably going to start tweeting this out. I'm probably going to start filling this out regularly. But it should give you a pretty good idea of how far we are. 100% done, not including the next 7 reworks. Yeah. You never know. Yeah. You don't know what you don't know. So, of course, we're updated today because I had the first beta test, which puts us at 25%. This is because I presume I need, maybe, like, at most 3 more beta tests, and then soon it'll be 100%. How did Badub make a bunch of PK songs as well? That's interesting. I was not aware of that lore, but that sounds about right to me. I'm going to get retention before GTA 6. Huge. I don't know. When the game could be released? I've just found out about 4 years, so I'm just wondering when it'll be released. Is this a troll? I'm being trolled? I'm being trolled, right? Just... No, I'm being trolled. There's no way you came here 30 seconds after we discussed that and then asked that question. What gives it an animation error? The error with the painting is not that floating points exist or anything like that. The error with the painting is the fact that they used the floating point value like that to keep track of time. When does the game release? Pinning this? Yeah. Here, progress tracker. You can track the progress. You now know that a lot of stuff is getting done and there's no release date. It's going to release when it's done, basically. Okay. Case the document doesn't say release date? You are going to die tomorrow. Maybe. The course order in that document is not final. Oh. Hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. I mean, I get like from an individual perspective. It's like a very innocent thing to ask for a release date and nothing you should feel bad about. But with like the mass of people asking that question, it is extremely annoying. But obviously, you as an individual has no fault in this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. Oh, that's actually not a terrible idea. I thought C3 will get another rework. Possibly. I mean, I consider it finished, like it's in a playable and decent state. But there's a chance Biobak's like, well, I kind of want to make changes again. And then we'll make changes again.  No. It may be the floor texture. Yeah. The new combiner is what you would want, I assume. I get it. Honestly, I'm not very excited for Nintendo's new game either. Kind of like the desaturated look up here. Yeah. I think that looks cool. I think it's going to be a good game. But I'm not excited for it at all, because I'm not going to play it, because I don't like Banjo-Kazooie. I fucked up my candles, sorry guys. What's your take on Switch 2? What do you mean? It's going to have cool new software and useless new hardware. Please do not wonder why I hold random objects sometimes. I cannot stop touching random objects. It is just a thing I do. I will touch every random object I find. No quality image of French toast. Do not understand the reference. I mean I am the N64 man so obviously I believe that console software was good enough ten years ago and we didn't need any more upgrades. Anything after that is just expensive garbage hardware. Like can we just stop and just like explore one hardware? We're gonna get better games, we're gonna get cheaper games, I'm gonna get more games. No not the urchins! I don't like collectathon. No I just think it's kind of boring. I mean I haven't played much but when I played it I didn't like it very much. So we need to transition to sand here. Just take a picture. Okay. So what am I gonna do here? This likely would want a grass edge. Yo, thank you for the 5 USD. So I'm just going to drop the workout routine in chat. My workout routine is actually super simple. I have a document here called workouts. Let's see, it's pretty simple. Pull-ups with 61 pounds, calf raises with 113, dips with 41 pounds on day one, then squats, triceps, dumbbell curls, next day bench press. This is the day I'm on right now. So later I'm gonna do shrugs with 323 and lateral raises with 37 and then I do this and then I just repeat. And then after I'm done with that, after repeating the six times, I do this with a lighter weight and more reps six times. And I just repeat that. It is that simple. Hello Segwo. True calcite? Well for most games it's true. There are some games that you cannot make without realistic graphics or that work better with realistic graphics. So I get it on that aspect. I just think we're overdoing it. Graphics is not a one-size-fits-all solution. There isn't just a good-to-bad graphics slider, there is art style considerations and stuff. And some games or some game concepts just happen to work better with an art style that is more expensive to render. Something like GTA probably. I don't actually know if GTA needs the realistic art style to work. But I imagine it works better with the realistic art style. But this is a random guess, I don't actually know. I'm not too familiar with GTA's design. All Rockstar Games is just kind of like do chores. Idiot. Yeah, I definitely see that Biobak. I think realistic graphics burns my eyes and the goggles do nothing. Not familiar with that one either. Don't break the illusion from my favorite Rockstar Games ever again. Have you ever played Bully? I think Bully is like the best example of it. See, I haven't played much GTA, but I have tried to beat Bully. And playing Bully, I realized like, oh my god, this game is just chores. You guys should not see inefficient development practices as like, man, they didn't optimize it. This game sucks. You should see it as like, okay, they cut a lot of corners to produce this game cheaper. Like maybe it saved the company money, maybe this allowed them to spend that money on other things. In my opinion. Of course, you can also see it as like, okay, this is just a cheaply made game. Yeah, it's a case by case basis. When you look at Pokemon, you can definitely just look at it and draw the conclusion like, yeah, this is just a cheaply made game. This is shovelware. Talking about chore games, yep, Bully. Perfect game that is just chores. That's true, Biobak. That will be game of the year automatically. Okay. Who are all these DMs from? If you heard about Viscari Cleanup Detail, you play Gen and your levels can take well over 8 hours. I have not. Sounds about like the same gameplay as Bully though. That's Mari Sunshine, true. Also Unreal Engine is a fact that it has a stupidly high minimum requirement for the amount of graphical quality you get at lowest selling. Yeah, Unreal Engine is a game or an engine that's like... The idea is that you can render really big games, but it also means that it scales well, but the base is not good. You know what I mean? It's like... Imagine you have to move from your current home to the middle of an octagon. The way you can achieve this is you get a car or a boat or a plane and you fly over there. The other way you can achieve this is you build train tracks and you build the infrastructure required to move there. Unreal Engine is kind of like doing the second. Yes, moving one person would be very expensive, but moving 10 people wouldn't be much more expensive. Of course, you just want to move one person, so when you're doing something cheap, it's a huge amount of waste. At least that's how I perceived it. I don't know if I'm right about this. I mean, what do I know? I've only been programming in Unreal Engine for two years. Has America heard of this? True. True. Do you remember the UnrealMario64 channel? He had to delete his channel because he got banned for impersonating Unreal Engine. It's kind of insane. When I checked on my own, I thought Chris 1, 2, and 3, 1, 1, was done. Then I checked Chris 2 and under's status. I just hope that you get the Biobak rework done as soon as you can, because while I don't have a single idea of what the hell Biobak is, what I do know is that when reworking something for something else, it's pretty damn important to make sure that everything works. Huh? Biobak is the guy in chat, two messages below you, and two messages above you as well. And then, I don't know what the rest of your message means. Biobak is not going to break the game, I hope. I don't even know how he would do that. I should probably decide on this one next. It's a big house level now? No! Okay, so what you might not realize is that Biobak rework is just him updating the graphics. That's like 90% of what he does. He does make some gameplay changes, but they are all very simple to accommodate. Conker being loved universally is still crazy to me. There has to be some fake gamer girl bullshit, like no way people love Conker. It's funny because there is piss that's fucking hilarious, dude. I don't even know what I'm doing. I don't even know what I'm doing. I don't even know what I'm doing. Yes, if Conker's Bad Fur Day has no haters, I assume I am dead. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is Conker's Bad Fur Day. I love this show. We're watching this now? Can say whatever the hell you want. I don't even know what I'm doing. I don't even know what I'm doing. You see it? I'm glad you see the vision. You see it? I'm glad you see the vision. It's kind of gets to my core. I would have paused that scene four different times out of cringe. The entire show is like that. Dude, I love I Think You Should Leave. It's such a good show. I think you should leave as artistic vision. The office is creatively. There's no soul in the office. All right, I'll say it. I think you should leave that show as soul. The guy has been playing the same character for like 15 years. He is passionate about this. I respect the arts. I think you should leave for real. No way, dude. I love the one of the egg video game. Yeah, they're all great. Yeah, what if we made a video game where you had to do chores and by doing chores, you could generate a currency that you could use to buy tools to make your chores go by faster. And the whole game, the whole goal of the game was to make enough progress so that you wouldn't have to play the game anymore. Oh, wait, Harvest Moon already exists. I'm not talking shit about Harvest Moon. I am accurately representing the game. This is quite the most popular games right now. I played the game by Advance Harvest Moon and it was very exhausting and I didn't really find it that fun but then I remember there was the Gamecube Harvest Moon and I always tried to get into it as a kid but I never could. So I wanted to give it a serious try, I was like I wanna play this no matter what. And online it said, oh wow, the town in this game feels so alive, you gotta experience this and then I played it and it's like, no it doesn't, nothing's happening. The NPCs are stagnant for like 15 hours of game time at a time. How does this one feel alive? So, I think Harvest Moon just isn't for me. My rolemaking.com bio? What does my bio say? Oh, I see. Did my mind with Harvest Moon but wouldn't that just reduce Minecraft to a game mode requiring diamonds? I think there is a significant difference here in that in Minecraft you create something. In Harvest Moon, I guess you kind of create something but it's not to the same extent, right? I don't think you can put those two games equal in that matter. What do you think of my stats? Cookie Clicker, playtime 1008 hours, you just hit this run in the background, you didn't actually spend that long on it, it's no way. What do you mean the issue with Minecraft? What's wrong with Minecraft? Is there more than enough Cookie Clicker? Yeah. I know. Dude, that's actually crazy, dude. With the electricity you spent on playing Cookie Clicker, you could have mined 0.01 bitcoins. Maybe 0.0001. What a waste. This could have all gone to bitcoins. Another terrifying statistics. 190 hours, holy shit. I think I have like 3 hours on PL. Oh, that sounds like Super Mario Galaxy 2.2 or some other shit Kalkwek made. All of Kalkwek's hack is like receiving a lobotomy. Scan at the point of them. Super Mario Galaxy 2.3, I knew it. Typical Kalkwek. There's 465 stars on B3313. Dude, I was saying to Eiza, I should just make B3314. It would be so easy. We could make the whole game in like 2 weeks. You just shit out a map in like an hour and that's it. Is there any idea that it's been said that a game is just a series of interesting choices? That's why I don't understand the popularity of Telltale Games. Is it just to have new choices every episode? Game is a series of interesting choices. I'm trying to think of a game that has no interesting choices. But I think saying that interesting choices is what makes a game like valuable as a game is already pretty close to the truth. Pisses me off so... I see, yeah, fair enough. Are there movie games? Yeah, there are movie games. I'm also thinking of something like Pokemon Let's Go, which basically has no interesting choices. You just mash the A button. But maybe if you have had a lobotomy, there's more interesting choices. I just haven't had a lobotomy. I have a grand experience making fake costumes for upcoming secret projects that will be a banger, no doubt. Oh, nice. Serene Fusion, Eureka and Decades Later, have you played them? I have played Serene Fusion, yeah. It was decent. I think I've played Eureka and I didn't like it much, and I don't like Decades Later. You're not just going to use it in a game where you have the biggest impact on the scenario, like Minecraft is only as interesting as yourself? That's also kind of true. Okay, this texture is obviously terrible. I don't like it at all. I think it's the chalk part that's bad. Supposedly it's a complex simulative game, but the main game that everyone plays is as brain-dead as peanut. That's true. Well, most JRPGs are pretty brain-dead, right? And people don't like complex JRPGs. They want to just press highest damage move until you are at low HP and then press heal. At least, that was my perception of people. He has definitely had a lot of influence over the art style of many hackers. And it is an art style I don't like. What do you mean, what did he do this time? Brody has not had any controversies ever. Brody, it's like... Actually, nevermind. Nevermind, he has had controversies. But like, no public ones. Nothing anyone was actually upset about. There's no Brody drama. He hasn't done anything. He just wants an answer that isn't for the player, but for a viewer of a player. What? Makes no sense to me, what you just said. Kind of like the Rocky look of this. Yeah. Yeah, the trees is definitely one thing that gets me too. Oh my god, how are so many people pinging me? True, the old ass Brody references. Oh my god. I think that's a little better, but still not great. One second, I gotta leave an annotation to my video. Cool. Dude, yes. The 6 out of 8 red coins is like... Who is forcing you to put red coins in there? If you don't want to do it, just don't put the red coins there, bro. Come on, man. Why are you acting like... Why are you damage controlling something that you didn't even need to put there? Come on, man. Okay. Well, there is the idea that an AI or an LLM maybe even could become a sort of game master the same way that D&D already works, but I am not allowed to say this publicly because if I do, then people that hate AI are going to tell me I'm a bad person. But I do think there's potential there. I think it could be cool, like, you know how as a kid when you play GTA you just activate cheats and fuck around? Imagine that, but with a game master to make it so that all kinds of fuckery you do actually has an appropriate response by the game. And of course you can say, oh, well, why don't programmers just program 2 billion different cases for every type of behavior you were doing? But obviously that is not realistic. Just saying, each time I enter so many yellow, blue, and red coins, I understand everyone else is doing it. Who wants a public donation? No! No way! Did I just speak in public about something? It's so over. Ha! Oh. I probably send Dino. I mean, I'm sure you could make a really bad one that fits on an N64. Right, the problem is that to make a good one, you need a huge scale. Actually, what if we made them, like, really deep here? I think that could look pretty cool. But only where the water actually is. Time to knuckle up. I'm in a deep cut. I'm actually writing a video as I speak. No! Don't fall off case, Emmanuel. No! You're going to make up stuff about me as well. Did someone get skinned in here? I know this. It would run, it just would be really, really laggy. Okay, this type of rock looks awful when I do it like that. Can't really do it. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Five.   I worked with Casey, he's a sociopath. Someone get that guy on here. What happened to that guy anyway? The Mr. Beast sociopath guy. Did he get called out for, like, being an idiot and then just disappeared forever? It's the last of I heard. We need a fully AI-generated explosive video in this case. That's what Skelenio did. Skelenio did AI-generate the video. So what you're asking for already exists. Crazily enough. And the video was as bad as you're imagining it right now. MrBeans had his goons assassinate him. He got shot down hardcore. Oh, I do not know vintage story now Every time you hear voxel game you already know they're like just copying minecraft well I guess in the current day I can see people actually just being passionate about minecraft and like trying to copy it because of that other than being like oh yeah this will get me cash but back in the day like for sure every time you heard like voxel game it was like okay I want money I'm making this for the money So here man it's not too far fetched I think he got shot down I don't know wasn't there something stupid he did and then people stopped taking him serious and he just stopped what is his name duck duck duck fall for something that dog pack 404 he just stopped uploading nine months ago he has 650,000 subs and he just stopped uploading come on man there's so many people preying on MrBean's downfall and you're just dropping it like that come on you could have generated generational clout your children could have been famous too he got pregnant oh MrBeast had him taken away this is a chill song it's kind of cool kind of like it how's their scene they beast them to death I mean I agree with you that that's also how humans work like no doubt I think people do not like the idea that they as humans are not special and that's like the crux of the issue how's their how can there be a scene by Zelda what is Hytale how long have you known Biobak for probably since he started r64 hacking right it must have been like eight nine years 2014 oh so yeah 10 years probably when since we've known each other but obviously not as long as we've worked together it's flipped this whole site is flipped that's why it doesn't and they claim that will dehumanize us that may be true but also precise non-human if a cyclic universe is correct just just throw that gigantic assumption in there oh no I am also agreeing with you that there's like no ethical good reason that you should be ethics are only respected as long as they're convenient enough this is how people behave and it is something you have to deal with what is this Hytale oh it's minecraft this is like open world minecraft with like the game not being building stuff but rather like there's a story going on like in zelda games or whatever minecraft would actually be such a banger game to make like an adventure game out of with all the stuff that's in there imagine you just take mining away from people and now the only way they can you know make progress is by like finding chests and like unlocking stuff kind of all you need to make a banger game did I see the minecraft movie I have not okay it was supposed to be the minecraft killer oh no i'm sure that one worked out well people love when you kill their favorite game when you must endure the breast over the state of a new man you should watch it ah i'm good this is it's a children's movie right like just let children be is it rage bait to say that the minecraft is like a children's movie i feel like some people would get really upset over that the same way if we like called pokemon like a children game remember she told me the kids are screaming chicken jockey like 10 times an hour during class i was playing left for that two days ago and the children were also screaming chicken jockey every 10 minutes except they were grown men it was kind of funny though where do you humans ruin us yes of course i can only acknowledge that we're hypocrites rather than trying to justify epitomizes normal now people can never i think you're completely right but people would never admit to that so okay see if i have an era 8 2006 you can't find with the sampling nope never heard of that okay i have all these bug bites on my face so it's undefined symbol i don't know what that means i never dealt with symbols in assembly my assembly was all pure ram addresses no symbols just a good shit i'm surprised you learn assembly aren't you like doing game development i thought assembly seems like very far away from game development or is this like an elective class you're doing comp sign up oh i see you graduated the game design and i guess it's difficult to get the job with just game design fair enough you're absolutely right orland but and this is this is the way i view it i think morality like that should not be pushed onto the individual that's some big oil conspiracy to me i think morality and ethics like that should be part of law because as an individual you are too depersonalized from that you're too far away doesn't matter to you that matches an individual it doesn't exist on like a law level then the impact you do from making better personal choice or more ethical personal choices is not going to significantly change the world i think it's not gonna improve the world you live in by more than you make your own life worse by sticking to these strict rules i guess that's the way to put it this is kind of your job as a game designer right you wanna design the rules in a way where acting in a way that it will be fun for every person in the game is encouraged or pleasurable or you know whatever the the right word for this is hello luma less i'll take one more please you're just too lazy to find a job honestly as long as you can just live you know while studying then that's perfectly fine the idea of just studying forever is kind of sick i think a lot of people would love to do that work for me it don't work for me i'll take one more please it's like i don't just eat the rich but they think they're poor well what you're describing will probably never exist so and it's also something that people would never agree on there's many ways to improve the world that people will never agree on right is the beach already done the beach here yes we didn't program anything yet but we have the base shaders done so now we're moving on to part two which is this part here so i don't know if this is like a viable visual for this or if this looks poopy i think it looks poopy looks bad thank you so you guys been so long i've watched the entirety of lost after starting and before finishing you watched hunter hunter yet you should watch that Wait, last or hunter hunter, which one? Oh, hunter hunter, got it, got it. Lost is not enemy, oh. I hate that the lion is a perfect octagon, it's not going to be a perfect octagon for the lion, it's not going to be a perfect octagon, it's not going to be a perfect octagon I don't think it's possible to make an impartial anything, there's always going to be one person arguing that this is biased in a certain way, what does impartial even mean? I love asking what things mean, it's my favorite thing to do, you're going to be stuck here for the next 15 minutes, you're all going to be stunlocked, this mario shirt, I completely forgot I was wearing this. Do you think nintendo could DMCA my stream for wearing a mario shirt? They would send me a motor to shoot me, possibly, I paid money for mario 64, that didn't stop I don't know if I got let's play mario, if I had mario let's plays I'm pretty sure they would have been taken down by now. I miss the prank invasion youtube era, hey guys I'm here at venice beach and it's mommy coming undone drink from the fountain we are all one I don't think I want to be grass inside a cave entrance, true, that's why the grass is going to be fading out here don't make fun of my music I'm going to I believe that conspiracies do so not because they've been logically convinced mostly rather they believe things out of emotional reasons, I think there's a lot of rational reasons to believe some conspiracies, there's a lot of conspiracies I believe anyway that I have like no emotional stake in can I say that rockcheck still looks bad in engineer hope it's changed before final release sure no rubble, there is a good chance it will because after all this is before the Biobak rework so anything you see is still subject to change being said I'm not sure which rock texture you're talking about this music sounds like a car with bad brakes running into some trash cans okay you guys hate my music well of course there's a lot of stupid conspiracies people believe in like flat earth I believe in the flat earth conspiracy conspiracy as in I believe that flat earth theory as a whole is a conspiracy it was people were made to believe stupid people were made to believe into it to make it seem as though believing in conspiracies altogether means you are insanely stupid like a flat earther would be this is my conspiracy and I guess one thing about conspiracy theorists is also they always 100% believe their conspiracy to be true the belief I just add that I'm like 60% sure it's true I 60% believe that flat earth conspiracy theory is a conspiracy theory this is the fey by Ymir yeah I agree that's a weird shift I need some more colors does that be a little looking still good also yes then the theory is becoming more and more true here demons are real though true demons aren't real who pooped my pants last night checkmate oh so my conspiracy is already confirmed so that makes it so much better like instantly it's way better that is conspiracy is last thursdayism the idea that the world was created last thursday I mean you can never disprove it but it's also a theory that doesn't explain anything so it's kind of like a stupid theory to even consider I don't think the color is great and for sure the wrong rock type for a volcanic island oh I see yeah we can still swap it out do you like the stripes though I like the stripes a lot this is okay fine we're listening to this now  what a stupid song I'm skipping this one  yeah the delay is pretty atrocious nothing I can do about it the earth is hollow though true I believe in velocity raptor shaped earth maybe we should find a new rock texture we have the rock expert in chat right now like this would be the time to do it so I don't know molten metal doesn't sound very hollow to me but I guess that's just semantics AI slop song wait what so maybe the effect of the relics class uh blender I always listen I always play games with music off like that I do not yuko yukuku all right since the rock expert is here let's take a look at rock textures see what we can do just ping me again  okay what if we google volcanic rock let's see oh these are lava rocks but that's not what we're looking for right we're looking for volcano we need to make notes of the rock requirements because I'm not gonna have the rock expert on hands hello I'm your cat preschool disco would go hard with the song true yeah I don't really get it I guess this looks more like a volcano um the final build Should work on overdrive. I do plan on figuring out why the overdrive crashes. I mean, I can't 100% promise it, but I am feeling fairly confident that I can fix it. This texture is not seamless. The problem, Erlend, is that that's going to take over too much of the islands in that that's high-tune and I don't want that either. What is this texture? Why is there like a not seamless texture like this? I'm looking at it now. I'm curious. It's everywhere. How is it seamless? Why is it seamless? Am I stupid? Oh, okay. It's not awful awful, right? But it also doesn't feel right. This feels more like a pile of boulders. Is this more like it? Is this volcanic rock? Defendable by Flash Builder Clone Card. Usually it is possible to do that, but when I do that, when I let people make flashable ROMs, which by the way it's very difficult to prevent people from making flashable ROMs, but if I don't prevent people from doing that, then people are going to make bootlegs of my game and sell them. There's actually an entire industry for that. There's probably, I bet my ROMX probably made over a million dollars at this point through rebroad cartridges. The problem is I'm a little scared that Nintendo is going to murder me for that, but I have nothing to do with it. It looks like ass. I'm trying Gale Note 01E0. This one? That's gotta be awful. Yo, thank you for the $5 requesting Become God by Ghost Data be added to the rave playlist. That's a good one. All right, we can listen to that soon. But this one's a banger too. We listen to this one first. Oh my god, fine, I'll look at that one too. 3830. Oh no, this one's awful. You know if you press A L B Z B A L Z and a button at the same time something cool happens? Really? Who could have known that? Dry ground? I see. I see what you mean now. This one feels like it has potential, but let me take a look. That looks a lot more volcano doesn't it? I mean of course the texture looks at the range, but like the idea of it kind of works. Yo, where's our rock expert? I need to know from our rock expert. Is this acceptable? So his name was Nobu something. And Bulda crushed the rock expert now. Okay. Well let's take a look in game after all our work here. Polava, we need Dome Tender the lava expert. Going to post in discord, all right. What is a good resource for rock texture? rocktextures.com Wait, I never showcased this. What do you guys think of this here? This mechanic? Wait, where can I actually showcase this without the game crashing? Oily Boily Bay maybe? You see the icon in the bottom left? Cats in Skipper. Long-range streaming, I'm not sure. The fines adds to and cleans up the terrain. I mean your idea of a futuristic AI sounds exactly like another person that can help you in all digital matters. So in a way of course it's like that. A button do you want? Any button. Except the power button. Yeah, I kind of like this texture. So let's see. The players are going to have clear horizontal lines. These come from different layers being deposited over time. The grass is growing up to cover that certain slope. Okay, so the grass is covering part. I think we have some of that. But let me take a better look. One second, I want to fix the UV map here first. This UV map is garbage. So horizontal layers. Okay, horizontal layers sounds like a good idea. Grass is growing to cover at certain angles. Of course, of course, we have grass here. I was kind of thinking maybe some grass up here. Anyway, how use AI to make party by a beta video that talks about the improved algorithms. I'm not sure how AI will practice into this. Anyway, become god ghost data as requested. Okay, I do like your idea though. Oh, it's kind of what we have here with these, right? Okay, I guess there's another component to it where it's like the actual rock is more like rocky, less chunky, more grainy. One million Mr. Beast. What the fuck was that? So So  I will agree that this looks a lot more volcanic to me. Well, black-grey is not very Mario-like. So I think I have to draw the line there, I can't make it black-grey. Well, now we have horizontal stripes, but this looks kind of horrendous. Sisyphus, he would kind of fit, yeah. To stay true to Mario than realism, also true. Hanging anise, volcanic rock, no sedimentary rock, I don't know what that means. I am not as much of a rock expert as Jeff. Wave rock is interesting. Okay, let's try it out. This kind of looks like the images you guys are showing me. Is something like that what we were thinking? Okay, so the lava has plants growing out of it, interesting. Okay, let's try it out. This seems more like layered rock. I guess if you really, really want this to be good, what we need is this to fade into a different texture, like up here. To become more bouldery, right? Kind of like this rock here. We only have virtual stripes at places where there was a crack. It should be rare and thin for active volcanoes like this. The cliffs are going to have clear horizontal lines, so it's going to have different layers being deposited over time. I'm not sure what you mean. If that's not what you were looking for. Just make the cliff flat at the top and put some grass there. Yeah, well, if you put grass there, it's going to look reachable. So I'm a little worried about making that happen. I think this texture here has potential though as a replacement for this one here. If we make this a little more contrasty. Yeah, I kind of like that. They're doing geothermic rock analysis. Meanwhile, my rocks are mostly all finely attached so that it doesn't look like shit. Cliffs are flat at the top normally. Yes. You know what? Maybe it is the right move to say, fuck the rocky parts. We're putting grass on top. What if we just cut these off like halfway and made it grass there? Yeah, I think that's the right play. We just shorten all of this like so. And then there's going to be grass on top. And then we can just make it so that you can't reach it. I think this is the right decision. It's going to look a lot more friendly, which is important for Yoshi's Islands. In other words, it covers whatever rock is there, when it comes, it erodes part of it into dirt. Then when the next layer of lava comes on top, you get the horizontal lines. So that does explain this part, and it doesn't really explain this part here, or this part, this side. So I guess the stripy part should only be on the left side, and the right side needs one without the stripes. Because this is a different rock altogether, because there was no lava here, right? The volcano is only on the right side. Outside walls, volcanic, then a new one, outside walls, volcanic, not volcanic, then we take this one here, and replace it for something less volcano looking. Maybe not that one, but you get the idea. Definitely also not that one. Let's try the rescale combiner. Let's try that. Well, I think we all get the idea. So we have one volcanic side and one normal side, and then we need to make the colors mostly equal. I think that the left side looked good with the previous texture. OK, well, I still want the same base rock layer, but yeah. I think this area is fine. Definitely need some decals around here. And then this side here should be all non-volcanic rock as well. So I guess I have to cut it off here and here. That works for me. OK. Yeah, then obviously I need to make the colors equal, but I think the idea works. So right now you have to decide how active you want the volcano. It could maybe erupt and cover some of the island with lava and have cool over time. It only erupts once and it's like for kind of story reasons. What ideas went through your head when voice acting for Chaos Chaos Edition? Not much. Do you find a way to fix the lighthouse? Nope. This is a Fast64 bug. They need to fix the program. I can't do much right now. Anyway, I'm feeling done for right now. I think we made some good progress. The middle area looks like something now. We got volcanic rock. We got to still make the transitions not suck, but that should be no issue. We can do that some other time and I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye.
