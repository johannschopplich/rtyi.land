Hello, hello? Anybody home? Hello, Sully? Interesting. Yeah, Zeina's in the same house, but she's upstairs. Case you're early? I'm sorry, Lilaa. You get an extra minute of case today. I hope you can survive it regardless. Hello, SuperMario64Fan. So, I had an idea yesterday to just rewrite Mario's collision entirely. What you're seeing right now is the rewritten collision. Still has a few issues, but I think it's already a lot better. Stuff like this just works now. Kinda. But we still have some issues with ceilings. And that's not a bug with the collision. That's actually just because the collision map is fully loaded out. So don't worry about that. I was gonna put that into the level right now, Zeina. Case, how did you get the black bar at the end of Jabu? I love your vids. I don't know. They are literally just me recording the game. Hello, Captain Mangles. Yeah, dude, I figured. What makes the most sense for the spin jump? Because I wanted a new animation. The twirl looked bad. And then I realized. The closest you have to an official version of the spin jump from 1996 is Mario's Down-B from Smash Melee. So, I went with that one. Bonjour. Does that actually mean good evening? Bonjour. Oui, oui. Yeah, Zeina made the animation and I just polished it up a little bit. Once my new collision system is done, dude, this game will be so nice collision-wise, I think. Much better than any other Mario 64 thing. Bon plus Zor. Oh, so Zor means evening. I see, I see. I am learning French. The building has a hat? Yeah. This is the hat shop. You can buy cowboy hats here. That's why I gave the building a hat. I think it's very funny. It also has a bandana. That needs backface culling disabled. Did that man put in a song request? Yeah, I don't want to put one in for Mario. At least not right now. Maybe at the end. I'll be fine with it, but not right now. Because we are still editing Mario's model. I made some changes to it recently. I added a few more polygons, made it look a bit better. I see it with this pronunciation. That's unlucky. Thank you for the free dollar donation. What's it saying? No, it's crazy bus. Zayna, you forgot to bundle the textures. Zayna, why would you do this to me? Your dad called someone? Your dad called someone? Who cares? Your dad calls a lot of people. To come to our driveway? What? Later your song request will come after the donation. Okay, but Zayna, I need the bulletin board with the textures. Unless you don't want to send it to me right now, then I won't. If your dad wants to waste his money plowing our driveway for literally no reason, he's free to do it. But I do not have the energy to care right now. I want to just work. Your dad didn't call? I know, Lila. Your dad would never call. Okay, our next mission is the Monty Mall here. Oh, but after the bulletin board. What? What is this music? It's a song request. So this is the bulletin board, Zayna mate. I think it looks very fun. We're gonna put a few guys on here. These are all drawings, Zayna mate. I think the dry bones are funny because dad or dad and the rest is dead or alive. And it's just me wanted for DMCA violation. This is just a standard CRT. Your day's been shit? My day has been good. Almost all my days are good. Okay, let me just get all of these. Why is it playing again? No, I'm terminating the song. I'm sorry. We're not listening to the song any longer. Is it just playing in loop? How do I how do I terminate it? Oh God, I can't. I can't listen to this. There we go. Yep, yours is better. No, it's when when it's a donation one, it's automatic. I can't stop it. That's why I have to switch off immediately. So that post is unwanted. It's so funny. We can insult someone so well with that. Wait, Zeina, why are these already downscaled? Did you draw them like this? Scale them down after they were all made. Okay, that should be fine. It looks fine to me. You probably have to do something like this. Yeah, the textures are individual. It's fine. Full brightness and more orange. Okay.  And I'm not sure it doesn't really look like the others anymore. I See, sorry if I got you to answer the questions. As a rule of thumb, if someone doesn't answer your question, don't ask the question again and ping them. Just leave it at that and then you won't annoy anyone. How do you fix Z-targeting? I don't know. Did missing link have fixed Z-targeting? Because I don't remember that. I think I like these colors here. Hello, CXLinks. Okay, your three minutes are over. Any OST wishes today? Yeah, sorry. Usually I skip songs after three minutes, especially if it's a song I'm not a big fan of. Mr. L, there we go. You have my full name? Goddamn. I think this should be fine. You know what? We should do all the colors at the end. Just let them scale down for now. This is a shy guy. Let's go to colors. Seems fine. Oh, we also need to make them foggy. Case, do you have my name? Yes. Wild Guns OST? We can do that. Wild Guns OST. I actually need to turn these into fog-shaded decals. Dude, I hate that this defaults to environment. If you default something to environment, it actually will render wrong. Because I ruined it. Sure, buddy. Why would you want environment color on an opaque thing anyway? That can just cause bugs. It's just a bad idea. Do you know how many I had to fix like that in the ship level? I was suffering. But Case... No, I'm not going to make the posters fly in the wind. These are just posters. I can't do all that. Oh yeah, you guys want to see the finished minecart mission? Yes. Can you move to another color? Yes, I did. I have to. Of course, I could do it, but I'm not gonna. I just realized that just changing this to opaque decal doesn't do anything. I actually have to change the render settings. What is evil, Lilaa? Lilaa, I'm just turning them into grayscale now. I am still going to do the colors all at the same time. It doesn't make sense to do them one by one. It's a huge waste of time. Why do you guys insist on making my life painful like this? Case, that moon jump cheat code looks really overpowered. I think you should turn it down. I don't know what to do. Who is being so loud upstairs? What is Zeina doing? Is she just taking the house down? I don't know. Hans, I want to say fuck off. I need to talk about my UVs. No, no, no. See, what I want to say is suck my dick. But I can't because that's against the law. We're literally snowed in. Wait, why are you outside? What the fuck are they doing? Dude, can I not even just look away from the house for two seconds without everything going to shit? I think this should be layer four. No, cut out, not opaque intersecting. This is another situation of this. Well, I can't answer the question because, you know, legal troubles. If. If. These two are fine. This one's fine. This one's fine. This one is not fine. This one is not fine. This one's fine. Okay. Step two. Set the render mode. For actually making SM64 interesting beyond the nostalgia factor. Yeah, I don't think Mario 64 is that great either, except for the movement design. Like the level design itself is not great, but the movement is like awesome. So that's the part I want to change. My liver area is giving me random sensations. Do you think I am dying? Okay. You liver area. You're probably fine. It just does that sometimes. Well, the thing about Mario 64 levels that I think is maybe not so great. It's a lot of them like placeness. You know what I mean? A lot of them just exist and they don't really feel like anything. What's your guys' favorite Mario 64 level? I think mine might actually be either Tick Tock Clock or Big Boos Haunt. Bob-omb Battlefield? Bob-omb Battlefield is so lame though. The hell? Yeah, once for all, just as good. The lag phase was probably an issue among the dev team. So they just made every level being incomplete and just cutting from the current world. I mean, the idea of paintings is very cool. So I'm not hating on that idea, actually. CCM? Tick Tock Clock, just because I like the creativity of the theme. Tiny Huge Island, he says. Hazy Maze Cave. Shifting scent on each level. Okay, I wasn't even thinking of Hazy Maze Cave. That also makes sense. Okay, but I would argue that Wet Dry Wild has placeness. At least a little bit. If you say Wet Dry Wild works because it doesn't have placeness, that's the one level that has the most placeness out of all the levels. Except for maybe Big Boos Haunt.  Big Boos Haunt has more placeness. Yeah, exactly. What Biomex said. I don't think this is the Hexer's Inn I used. But it has the whole city thing. Nanaki has a Lost Cat Buster. That's a funny idea. Yes, I agree. I think this works well now. Is he watching Mashle where muscle meets magic? No. The hidden areas of the place is the fact that they exist outside of Mario. I think that contributes. I don't think that's all of it. I think for places it's very important that the level has like a theme. A vibe. Something that you can identify the level with. A great counter example of that is Mario 64 Madness Course 13. Where is it? Let me find Course 13 of Mario 64 Madness. Okay. This guy hates it. Where is SM64 Madness, the fuck? Okay, I cannot find it, but trust me, this place looks like it doesn't have a concept. He still loves PL, true. You think 64 Madness belongs in the Shadow Realm? That's so rude for something I poured my heart into. Can you believe Zeina would say something like that about something I poured my heart and soul into? I've heard people say that Madness is the only good tag I made because it has the most soul. Everything else after that is just like mainstream garbage, but Madness, it had soul. Unlike everything else I made. Yes, I made Madness in two weeks. No way you think Madness is bad. Have you ever thought that the Shadow Realm is entirely a localization thing and the original doesn't exist? People just die? He might crush their stem, right? That's what he does in the original. If I listened to Zeina more, I would be fucked. Ignore the step result thing, I'm making a new step function. This is actually the game is running on my new step function. There's just a few small bugs with it, like that one, that when you sometimes roll out it just does the kick. Don't know why that happens yet. Who's this guy? Some fella came around the other day, weird shiny hat. He saw the bounty bot and he ran away. I don't know what this guy's deal was with the bounties. We do things the Milky Way. Dude, Milky Way is a hundred million times better than Bounty. Actually, it's an inconceivable amount of times better. It's like a negative amount better because Milky Way is like a positive, but Bounty is like a negative. So you're basically dividing by zero by a negative number. These are some very high quality posters, but there is a bit of an issue here. Did this man just say Milky Way is mid and Bounty is better? I mean, fine. If you think Milky Way is mid, fine, but Bounty? Come on. Unless you are part of the drug cartel, why would you ever say Bounty is good? Make sure to call this. I don't need to call it. Actually, maybe I do. Now the bounties don't get away after I catch them. I don't want to do that. Yeah, it probably makes sense to call this later. It would be so blurry. You wouldn't be able to read any of this. It is a better idea to figure out why it is rendering like this. Because it really shouldn't be. I think it might be like this because I didn't scale down the x-axis to zero before. Because when you use the decals, they need to be the exact same coordinate. So let's try that again. Maxi King is okay. Kazumi, wonderful games, but the game that touched my heart the most was definitely Zelda Missing Link. I'm sad that we didn't get more Zelda remakes with this quality ever after. I agree, Missing Link is definitely one of the best. I did have help from CDI and Zelda, which really helped the project. But yeah, it might be the best tech I've made so far. I'd like to make more, but where do I find the time for that? Damn, Hoshi and Lilaa don't like each other anymore. Oh no, Lilaa is just evil. Oh, okay. I actually feel the opposite in B-Turk. Those are the two Zelda games that I like the least that I've played. Except for maybe Skyward Sword. Oh, there we go, that's better. They render fine now. Do they have the proper fog? They do. They feel a little bit like their light is not part of the world, you know what I mean? They feel like they don't belong here. Yes, it does pants, that's what I use here. Oh, you know what? I think actually what's going on here is that when I don't actually use the fog, the coordinates of this can just be kind of rounded poorly. I think the issue here is coordinate quantization. So we have to align this to a world axis, which is fucked up. What's the most hilarious and complex thing you could do on the N64? See, okay, one hilarious and complex thing I thought you could do We have an idle thread on the CPU and this idle thread runs around 75% of the time because we're so optimized we only need like 25% of the CPU. What if we just put a Bitcoin miner there? What if the idle thread was just mining Bitcoins? It'd be very funny. How would you communicate with the Internet? You wouldn't. You would just mine the Bitcoin and hope for the best. You would just tell the player, hey, if you had actually been connected to the Internet, you'd be mining this many Bitcoins right now. Def was that made an Internet thing once? Well, there you go. We're going to be mining Bitcoins on 100 million N64s at the moment.   Yes, because the actual vertices are stored in world coordinates. Lila, how come there's this fast64 bug where everything just renders in white? I think I'll multiply this with a somewhat darker color. The Cozy's what now? Damn. The Cozy's is the farming on the farm. What are the levels for the other characters? I don't know the actual levels on 64DS. Of course, you can do mega textures, but it's more expensive. Just tune in. What are we working on today? We're putting the bulletin board with the one that posts us. And after that, we're going to be working on the mole mission. I finished the Minecraft mission. Actually, I will show you guys now what the Minecraft mission is. I think it turned out fine. So basically, you are in the bar and you don't know what to do here. But if you look around enough, you will figure out that there's a secret door. And the secret door is right here. And it leads you here. Blazes, the lost on our tails, scramble gang, scoot. And they just run off. And then... He didn't say, or did he? I think I changed that. It's like a little total mini game. It gets a little harder as you go because they get closer. And then... Well... Imagine this, but without the crash. The crash is because of my new collision functions. They're not fully finished yet. What happens if you jump on the tracks? If you are too far away, they just fade you out and kill you. Nice programming here. Shut up! It's not like Touhou. Touhou is difficult. This isn't. Okay, well, it's nothing like Touhou. It's only like Touhou if it was easier. But that's nothing like Touhou. I don't even know how anyone could look at that and think about Touhou. You'd be fucking stupid, because this isn't difficult. Why would you think of Touhou? Case, can't believe you would do this. What if you jump towards them? Would you get run over? No, you would just... Actually, if you jump in front of a minecart, you would get run over. But you can jump on the Shaiya's minecart. Though, that's not really helping you. Dementio, stop talking in esoteric languages. This is English only stream, please. Combine all the units? It's a custom version of GCC. Either way, next mission is this part here. We need a Koopa Bankier, and he needs to be like... Someone stole my money. We have a Koopa NPC, but he is wearing a big hat. Should we have him? Yeah, it's open source, but good luck finding it. It's somewhere deep in my discords. Racist Keisar game. Just because I don't want people to speak random languages. This doesn't look like a bank Koopa, right? It's easy as pies. Compile on all XD. Not mine. Should we tell her we act for fun? That is a funny idea. You know what? That's easy too. I can easily do that. Fuck it, I'll do it. It will be a little easter egg. It's actually Grants and Batman. Link the bartender Koopa's head. Grow 10 units or so every act. We have like three and a half levels left, basically. We're in course 12 here. Nothing would happen if you stole my documents here. Okay, guys. New rule. No more stupid questions. We want to make the game. We don't want to make stupid questions happen all the time. Bank employee Wild West. Let's look what that would look like. He looks so basic. He redeemed. Ask a stupid question. Oh, okay. No, Fursana. Why you too? Fine, I can drink some water. I don't know.  What do they look like in cartoons? Why is it always bank robbers? There's never a bank employee. Come over here, baby.   Isn't Fursana like 4'10"? Twitch is indeed mad. I don't want to make him bald. But I feel like bald kind of fits better. Yeah, you're an inch taller than Zeinaden. Oh, right. She's 5'3". She shrunk. That happens when you get older, actually. I don't know.           I feel like his eyes should be less standoffish. I just realized this part here. That's not good. I gotta fix that on the other Koopa as well. Do you need to exercise here if you want to make some Zeina? Okay, so why would a turtle guy have hair? Well, usually they have a cap, right? If you wear a hat, you're not bald. You are just half bald.   You know what I mean? You know the people that always wear hats? No one ever thinks of them as bald people. What? You know what? Fair question. It's more like a vibe, you know what I mean? Like being bald in a video game is not about whether you have hair, it's about the vibe. You do not? That's fine. See, I say a lot of really weird things, and like 9 out of the 10 times, you'll just be looking at them and be like, what the fuck are you even talking about? This makes no sense. But then 1 out of 10 times, it just hits you and you're like, yeah, this man is speaking to my soul. That's what I'm going for here. I think sideburns could look good on him. I can't find any bank employees in the Wild West. It's all just robbers. Why is it just outside? This is the only guy I found. You just found the texture for the t- Okay, what is it, Zeina? Can you send it to me? It just says this page is filled with nonsense, repeat it. And is it real 2401 confirmed? What about Westworld or live action? This page is filled with nonsense that- Yeah, I see, I see. Yeah, I watched Westworld as a preparation for the Wild West level. It's so sad, actually, what happened to season two. Yeah, I see you, Clayman. I read both YouTube and Twitch chat. I have no idea what Butyl Cemetery is. Maybe if you look for the inside, we'll find something. Nothing. Lilaa is EP maxing once again. Are you still dying, Lilaa? I don't know. When I hear about people being tired all the time, I think they're dying. What about like the gold store? What if we just look for a store employee? He is a monocle. I like the monocle. That's true, we're all dying, just slowly. You know what? I have an idea. Draw me a cartoon image of a stereotypical Wild West bank employee. They kind of just look like regular people. Oh, this is what I was looking for. Yeah, I like this man. Yeah, they even look like regular people in chat, GPT. Okay, let's give him black shoes and a black shell then. And maybe a longer beard. How optimistic we're just making stuff. Let's give him a fancy beard. Yeah, yeah, like a fancy beard. He should be wearing glasses, I think. Let's give him glasses. He can have some. He can have a little bit of glasses as a treat. Why didn't I have a well? Since we're all going to die, I say, why didn't I do any more? You eat unhealthy because you want to die faster? But it's going to be miserable. That doesn't make much sense. Glasses, but epic, but PNG. I need so I can live. Dude, same. I'm actually cutting down to 205 pounds right now. So I'm barely eating compared to before. Hmm. Let's see if we find something on model resource. No, that's not. It's like glasses, right? It's like tiny glasses that the guy's wearing. I want glasses like this that are like half glasses and half not really. Hmm. I was thinking maybe April 1st, I should just put Mario 64 to Unreal Engine. But like, I'll use the kite demo and it will just be Mario 64. But that feels so mean. I don't want Christ and to think I hate them. You know what I mean? Hmm. It's like this, but upside down. It's back to if I lost 50 pounds, I would either lose a lot of muscle or literally die. I don't have 50 pounds of fat on my body. Like, I think at least 100 pounds of my 213 pounds that I am right now is muscle. Hmm. Dumbledore's glasses, not really what I was looking for. I know how much 50 pounds is, yes. No, I find losing weight to be very, very easy. I don't have any issue doing that. So I'm not worried about losing that. The only thing I'm worried about is accidentally losing it too fast because that's what happened last time. That would not be good. Maybe we should just find like a character with glasses. What's a character that wears tiny glasses? 50 quid used to buy you a video game. True. Still can, I think. Penny. Okay, let's go with Penny. Oh, these are big glasses. I want like the half glasses. You know what I mean? The ones that they use to like evaluate things. Like this man here. Oh God. There's a lot of this we could just turn into a texture. You know what? I feel like if we just. Why is that all cars? I feel like if we just scroll down here, we'll find something pretty fast. Monoclonal. Great. Very helpful. Dude, I wonder how many furries there are in the audience. I feel like 126 viewers. We have at least five or six furries in the audience. I think that's a realistic number. Hello. Hello, Liliana. We have one confirmed furry. Lilaa is saying that so often that it's becoming sus. Paper Kitty. We have two furries. Gil, we have three. Oh my God, there might be more. This is what I wanted. This character has the glasses I was thinking of. Where are the glasses? I don't see it on the texture. Am I blind? Shit. Okay, we have way more than six furries. I was way off. I'm not a giant, but I think I'm somewhat tall for North American standards. Okay, let's give him an epic beard instead. Not like this. Okay, let's give him a beard.     What does beard be like at the bottom here? You're a North American though? No, but I live in North America. Yeah, I moved. Had to run away from all the taxes, you know. Five. Oh, that's not the type of text I was thinking of saying. Oh God, the fucking thing turned on. I'm dying. It's so loud. Now it just looks like it has a giga chat-chin. What the fuck is that? That is the fucking heater. I wish it wasn't this loud. It is ruining my stream once again. Awesome. Okay, this could look nice if we gave it a good beard texture. Yes, that is weird. Yes, it turns on to heat the upstairs area of the house. And it's like 15 degrees in here, maybe, where I am. I'll try your eyes, Zayna. The saturation on this is so different. That kind of makes him look older. I kind of like it. Yeah, fuck it. He's an old man, Cooper. His shell is less saturated. I think that's a cool idea. I don't know, BMGamer. Try it and find out. Balnor's skin. He's just old. Glasses can be 3D, yes, I know. I feel like he's a Cooper, an old man Cooper. So I'm going to give him a bigger nose. Just to make him look a little different. Zayna is indeed not Zelda. I don't know, Zayna. Old man nose usually turns super red. Oh, that would be a cool effect. But I don't think we can easily do that, unfortunately. Actually, I can give it a try. The thing about the N64 is, you can't have vertex colors and shade colors at the same time. You have to pick one or the other. So if you use vertex colors, we will not be able to have any shading on him. But since he's an animated character, we also can't pick the shading. So we can have vertex colors on him. I feel like the beard also needs to be on his upper lip or this looks weird. This just kind of looks like he has half a mouth right now. Maybe that kind of works if I make it brighter. Eh? I don't like it. He looks so fucked up. I didn't think it was that bad, but it doesn't look good either. How do you make it fluffier? He hates cement. Yeah, there isn't much I can do to make his nose red, not on one cycle mod. It is that bad. How do I make it less bad then? What if the beard is just like a separate thing that I just attached to it? I think that might be the better decision. Wait, that doesn't work with the upper beard. What if instead we kind of make the lower part less beard? So it looks more like a goatee, I guess. I don't know. Why are you giving Turtles here? Surely there's like an old man Koopa. Oh interesting that's how he looks. Dude can the heater turn off please? I am losing it. Bushy eyebrows I see. There's just one of these Koopas so we can be a bit higher on the polling counts. We are gonna make this transparent put this to layer five and then I want to try how it would look like this. Awesome I think that's a little bit better at least maybe I can even make this like a square gradient. It looks a bit more natural like this. It looks like snow. Hmm maybe I need to put a texture with some actual hair strands then. Actually I think a wood texture is the right decision. Trust. Oh Lilaa made a minor spelling error. joyous love and disease of theHave a  Five and five five five 566 five Five  five five five five five five five Skelton joke calm down the ball true Oh So This is as close as we can get to rendering individual hairs They should probably all just go straight down like this, I think that would look a bit better I'm gonna do one side and then mirror it back. I think that works the easiest here I Actually think it looks better with the bigger texture I Think this works. Yes. There's no hair direction. What do you mean hair direction? He were across Quebec and Ontario, I'm sorry for that What did he send me there Zeina Put it on his neck What is it a tie Cooper tie What am I looking at I don't understand oh It's kind of like a belt but like for your neck I'm from Quebec I'm Quebec. I'm not Canadian I Okay, so a tie is a belt but for your neck that is good to know I Looks good. Oh I'll speak it a bit longer then. Yep. I like it Do you consider Quebec to be Latin America or not? I have no idea. I don't even know where it is. I Thought the French hated Quebec I Don't French people like hate it when you speak the language wrong and Quebec people do that the French is kind of wrong I Thought that's why French people hate the Quebec's Or is this a lie I Yeah, but we have reasons we don't hate them but we laugh at them a lot I see I see Mm-hmm All right, all we're missing now is proper glasses Zeina made very wrong glasses. I guess I can try them Oops I Let in you say this would automatically work why doesn't that oh wait, does it work the other way I Yeah, he kind of looks like a bank guy at Lilaa light I don't think she did Still that's definitely a hashtag we should post on Twitter You Know what that we haven't done today yet. We haven't had a violent argument about power world. Are we actually on the Internet? Are we doing this whole internet thing wrong? Oh The OST ended Please please don't I'm begging you for Hylia's sake true I don't go bankrupt going to the hospital Are you sure Liliana? I Thought you were already bankrupt No, I'll be tall That is very funny Surely there's some kind of pun with Loha Pata here That I'm not thinking of That you could make I Know it turned on again French and proud but not in the race What would the French Confederate flag be just a white foot Oh He looks he certainly looks Okay, the beard is glowing that's a bit of an issue but other than that I think he's fine He needs a cane, yeah, I think a cane would be fine The Beard looks unattached because it doesn't have lighting. I forgot to turn on the lighting. Hey, we've got your awesome suggestion The last one I saw is French and proud what did I miss he needs an able able Swap What's enable As they know if you have a cool idea for the cane then I Mean go ahead and make it. I don't know how you're matching this shell right now, but it sounds like you have a good idea It's because they know said cane By Well, then Is it possible to make a skin can occur what do you think do you think it is possible to make a crook crane on the n64 I Just want to scale the glass down and put them at the end of his nose. Ah Yeah, putting them further forward good idea I Can scale them even smaller actually I Although any smaller than this and you're not gonna be able to see it anymore I Never considered writing modifying a C. Come on. I said I guess Yeah, but I could I didn't manage to compile GCC. So I gave up. Oh Yeah, I didn't even show you guys this cool feature yet, so I'm gonna do it right now This is a cool feature that the original 64 did not have which makes a lot of wrong making stuff really really annoying to do Let me show you Wait, that's the that's the wrong shy guys caught I Gave the wrong text Cooper a bank guy Wait, no, this is also shy guy after being caught What does it say free text? This is Cooper big guy and it's one three four Okay for this feature I need the dialogue in the game Compiling the GCC is easy. What do you mean? It probably is easy It's just really fucking frustrating Because you try it and it says compiler error and you don't know why and then you fix one and then there's another And then you fix that one and then there's another and then you fix that one and then there's another So I just didn't do it If it doesn't compile first try I'm out Okay So this new feature Biobak you're gonna like this a lot if you want to translate this game See if I talk to him the text box is small now, right? But if I make him sing something ah Dan What it will do is, it will automatically find the right size to encapsulate the text. That's cool, right? What should be facing the player if it was 2D? What's 2D? The glasses? I guess the glasses should not always be facing the player, that would clip into the coupon and look very bad. Let's think about the text. So what happened in the bank here is that someone stole the money and they ran away with it and that's where this digging tunnel is from. It will not look more 3D to have the glasses face the camera, that will look very stupid. Two dicks in my mouth, false. Kane facing the player? That's also crazy. To think about it, I don't know. Okay, so he's gonna talk about how someone broke into the bank and how he should bring it back. Wait, we need to make this sound more like a cowboy, like a wild west bank employee said That would be the suggested text. I don't know if I like it. Partner, we've had a break in at the bank and darn it if they didn't swipe a star right from under our noses. Do they have noses? Do Koopas have noses or beaks? I feel like this needs more Mario references. Oh yeah, that is too wild. That is a spelling error. Are they called badniks? Why is your keyboard so loud? I don't know. By duty facing the blade, he was referring to a billboard in the texture of Koop crane, not the glasses. That would also look terrible. What's a sonic? Okay, maybe baddie. Mario baddie. Are they ever references baddies? Mop? It's a panel robot. Oh, okay. Okay. What does Cappy say when you, when you capture it? Does it just reference creatures? How are they? To capture enemies and other creatures and objects. Some enemy swiped the star right from under my nose. That doesn't sound good either. Some crook. Yeah. Crook is good. No good fella. Yeah, no good fella is also good. Varmints, we already used the word varmints in a few places, I think. Yeah. I don't want to. No good fellas. Very good word. Bandit. Oh, bandit is also good. But no good fella sounds very Wild West. It's not really a heist, so I want to call it a break-in. Some goon. Well, it's not really a goon. Why is the heater on again? Who is making hot water? All I want to be is in my basement in silence, making Mario. Right now we've had a break-in at the bank and darn it, some no good fellas swiped the star right from under my nose. So the idea here would be that you see this secret path here and you follow it. This game would be something like, this game would say something like, wow, that's an impressive tunnel right in front of me. I wonder who made it. And then you follow it. It's a cold basement, Lollingstein. The heater is like heating up water and stuff upstairs. So it's not me that's being heated. It's still cold down here. You can play them on an emulation device. That's from the collision, just because there isn't really a collision here. So yeah, if you follow the tunnel. I really need to do something about the collision not existing because it's making testing impossible. Let me just... The problem exists because there's so many collision triangles here that the RAM is corrupting. No the basement has the water boiler. It is boiling the water for upstairs. And like there's an automatic heat regulation thing going on. So whenever the house gets cold, the heater turns on and makes the house warm and you can't turn it off. Such a shitty device. The basement doesn't have a cooler. It's just winter. It genuinely is the oily bally basements. Right, so the level entrance would be here. I still need to make this look decent and not be too... I do want it to be somewhat obvious. And there's the Yoshi coins that replace the 100 coin stars. Yeah so this should probably just fade into black I guess. The Yian voice line is from Smash Bros Melee. Well you don't have to do 100 coins. That's the thing. There are no 100 coins in this. I'm coding my own game right now. Nice. The man is coding. I am using Project 64. Have you looked at the screen? Yeah I'm not 100% certain on the voice line like this either. Because it's like very obviously not Mario 64. At least it feels like very obviously not Mario 64. Even though it is a Mario 64 voice line. Oh, do I financially support Project 64? No. Why would I pay for free software? Actually there was a tiny, tiny, tiny piece of me that was thinking of maybe buying Winrar. Paying a guy on Fiverr to make the voice. That is a conceivable idea. But I'm not sold on it. The Yian voice line is maybe a little loud but I got used to it after a few spin jumps in the video.  Also interesting. Okay but they've just maintained it to shit, right? Like the best version is 1.6. And after the whole next screen I literally just do not want to support it. And after the whole malware bundling thing I also do not want to support it. That's true. The 100 coin stars in JRB is pretty bizarre if you think about it from like a design perspective. How did that make it into the final game? That's genuinely not something that should have happened. That's definitely, it was 1996, they couldn't have known moments. Blues are worth five, reds are worth two. And they didn't know what level he was in back then. Okay so I want this to turn directly into a boss fight actually. I want you to go in there and then, actually do I want this to be directly a boss fight? That also feels weird. This is a bit of a weird start for me. Because the way I want this to work is the player has to figure out that there's this whole Monty Mole thing here. But there's a bit of a risk that they just walk in here without really figuring out that the Monty Mole broke into the bank. You know what I mean? Okay but you have to ask yourself what is the goal of a Mario or a Mario voice actor? Is it really to sound exactly like the old voice or is it to fit the creative vision of the game they're making? I think that's a bit of a question here. That doesn't have such an easy answer. I think maybe they want to change Mario's or Wario's personality a little bit. The way they've already been established that is also true. So I'm just fine. Interesting. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  No more 8-er. Skelenia and Shambles. I don't think they would pay you millions for that. When you work as a programmer in a big company you are not paid for how much work you do. You are paid for who you are. Which is sad but it is the reality. Okay let's give the Monty Mole a text. 135. It should be something like, oh that's a darn good tunnel. Translate this to Cowboy. That's a darn good tunnel. The true master must have made it. This is fucking awful. Oh my god. I will skip your song, Wes. Your song was awful. We're not listening to this. Have you seen this Biden banger? Is it, we own the finish line? Beer, it is used to make the brew beer. Oh, Earth Rider, thanks for the great legs. Thank you for the great legs, Earth Rider. You are paid for how ready you are to switch jobs and being a smart programmer. No, I don't think so. I mean generally yes, you are paid by how replaceable you are. But I don't think that's the main driver here. Not in the IT industry. With the laughingstock of the world, it's gonna get even worse in 24. Don't you have new... Elections soon like end of the year dude there's gonna be so many memes it's gonna get even worse I'm pretty sure all right the last ones weren't 2020 it shouldn't it shouldn't say borrow it should say tunnel it's gonna be funny and scary I almost feel like not making another super jump 64 because I feel like at this point it would almost be tasteless you know what I mean have I fixed invisible waltz I have completely changed the collision system yes and what do you think right now is a very temporary version of the collision system though that I started yesterday now you have a whole new step function free chat GPT trick I've been adding no yapping to omegenerosity works great so oh shit that is actually an insane trick I will try that what's wrong with you if you did huh I moved to North America not to the US very different no I don't drink I need to think of a better way to enter this whole thing here it's just not very good right now that's what I was looking for it only didn't yeah because it should just give the line of code that would also make sense it's called about the new collision system it's actually like stable Mario 64 collision system the idea behind it just isn't good and the idea behind it allows multiple clips and then we had a switch to raycast physics for a bit which just allowed most clips but it had other issues such as we had to either cut the step short or we would have to sometimes put Mario below the ceiling which is very bad and now I'm switching to a whole new collision system which binary searches for the largest viable step along with a raycast to like speed up the search and a bunch of like move verifications which should be cheaper and a lot safer yeah so the issue is you can literally just find the hole here I need to think of something better right now you kind of just figure out to go here from like the tunnel you see the tunnel here and you're like oh this goes into the mountain maybe I can go to the other side and enter it and then oh I can enter it but that sucks this is not a fun way to find this and you're not even gonna find it like that you're just gonna be here and be like yeah I see the entrance and then instantly a boss fight that's stupid no I won't make a video about the new collision stuff it's too complex not really marketable right we didn't add collision here you can make something underground that leads you to the hole like I'm more moving but I change again I removed the entire old step system Lilaa and would make one like none of the steps you see right now has anything to do with my 64 physics anymore right and it means I can interact with geometry like this with no issues although ceiling bunks don't work right now so that's that's the one thing I need to change it's not done yet I started on this yesterday I don't know what I have okay like a mall moving are you thinking like a mall moving along this track here with some like some particles coming out that could kind of work and then you would follow the particles and get here I guess I like the idea of a breakable boulder yeah I think a breakable boulder would solve this so we add the hints with the particles just going alongside the tunnel and then on top of that we'll have a breakable boulder here and you need to figure out to ground-pound the boulder to get in here I think that would work is that entrance leading to a bank no why did it crash just area 6 isn't here yet maybe like a very fake cardboard cutout of a boulder that would also be funny I think that's actually funnier so you would just punch it to destroy it and then I make okay we make particles appear along here and along here and then you have the hint of the bank employee telling you that they were being robbed and then this guy that says there's a tunnel and then you have to fake cardboard here you're probably not gonna think about punching the cardboard box if you haven't noticed this yet yes the lights in the void you guessed it right hmm all right let's make the fake card up boulder the center system rakers from here solution to the current one and this clear mesh collision at the current position yeah actually it doesn't both of those things it does also some other stuff like verifying there's a floor verifying that there's enough space like vertically you know all those things are you thinking something like this maybe without the black outline here and the black outline being in the actual level is it fast oh it's way faster actually that's the cool part how do you handle the case when a rake s passes through a small hole that the sphere wouldn't fit through just let it happen I would have to make a sphere shape cast river and stuff like that and I just haven't yeah I'm just trying to find a good molder right now I mean we're already romhacking right we might as well just take assets from Google who cares it'd hypocritical for us to like hack roms and then pretend like it's completely wrong to take assets you know what I mean yeah I just don't have a capsule cars like that pants otherwise maybe you now I know what you mean if I had a sphere cast I would consider it I would give it a try but I just don't and I don't think it's a big difference so I mean you can go to them yeah I just haven't you are right that that would be better make when you make one so yes that happens because of some raycast passing through small holes in the collision map wait so they actually do exactly what I just said would be a good idea damn but yeah it's honestly fine I mean we're making a Mario 64 IKEA right we're making a 10 million polygon unveil engine game so there are just not gonna be small holes like that it's gonna be super rare honestly it's gonna be so rare that I think the performance gain of using a raycast instead of a proper sphere collision might be more valuable there might always be small gaps because of rounding error no when I make collision I usually connect stuff like that I just don't leave gaps like that right I completely make my inclusion maps by hand so it's not something I'm worried about if there is a gap like that I would consider that a bug do I work alone I mean right now I'm working alone but I do have some help on the hack bio back is making a lot of stuff and it doesn't sort of register place or running or like that can happen oh no no we saw all the vertex positions directly it's basically like a completely separate 3d model that just has collision you yeah they know also helps a lot we also have baduk making a lot of music how do I add a new layout to this you know what I should have done this in Photoshop now that I think about it and this should be fine because I have a very specific plan here if you consider the format that's more optimized for the algorithm you use the vertices that we store in the ROM are being transformed into separate surfaces with vertices on runtime so how we store them doesn't really matter and it's the car my little music release you have to ask the dupe whenever he feels like it honestly I haven't talked in my sleep yet let's fucking go Lilaa is the tooth fairy she always comes by when you sleep and she steals your teeth if they're any under the pillow just this one vertex and then some vectors along the edges of the triangle that I would otherwise have to get from the vertices interesting that's not at all more 64 that's a mark 64s but extract is 48 bytes surface structure not about extract and it stores the surface normal I also think we're a little far along development to shut up Lilaa it's not a real boulder it's a fake boulder mom Lilaa is bullying me she's saying my boulder is bad but you don't think this boulder looks realistic are they still part of the main section of cyber burn choosing that's our that's probably available in every mission yes they are still available for selecting has to leave programming no do you plan to use any f8 xhs nope I want my stuff to work on me later can you put some stupid fucking meme under our nobody will notice nope well I mean obviously I can but I'm not gonna I guess I should see it that way it definitely looks like a fake boulder but it doesn't look very breakable you know what I mean it's my favorite Biobak that's why you gotta make games in two weeks so the memes you put in are still valuable and valid you know what I mean do we make it look breakable do we just add another texture over it with some breakable things do we just make it so that if Mario kicks this it like gets a hole like it's made out of paper hole in paper like this I think that would look funny very punches damage marks no I think we should actually just put a hole through it when you punch it some table and it's the most crudely made while I had another player play course five stemmer he kind of got stuck 50 minutes on something but it still took him 50 minutes for one course and there's 50 courses in this and that's like one of the speedrun players and it's seven stars out of like 180 so I could probably mention that this game has like a 10 to 12 hour runtime well the player will figure out that this is not like a good boulder thing I'm just thinking about do we need more hints that this is I don't think so and then second how do we make it break Hmm Yeah, if it's like a cardboard cutout I'm thinking just putting a hole into it like this I Guess it's kind of like a paper Mario rock. Yeah I Feel like it might not look enough like a cardboard cutouts how the cardboard cutouts look like in cartoons I Nothing really I'm thinking about the visual effect here. Not not like what the mechanic is. Obviously you punch it At a paper texture over it, what's that? What's this mean And it's that wouldn't pop up at the back and it's angled slightly Hmm We don't want the hole behind it to be too obvious, you know Okay, but I don't know what it means to add a paper texture over and paper is just white in my brain What is a paper texture? We're gonna get painted on piece of cloth that waves in the wind in front of the hole Also, when you touch it, it just kind of deforms Hmm I Think that might be better. Yeah Oh I see what you mean. So now you want a cardboard texture like a cardboard textile. Okay, I see You have to think about the lighting conditions in this level that's why it's not gray I Think the cloth might work best so hmm Wait, the thing about it if it's cloth would this just be like With the cloth background just be white. I Feel like that would be very obvious Maybe a cardboard cutout is not the play. Maybe it should be an actual boulder The more I think about it the more I wanted to be an actual boulder so players don't accidentally stumble upon the hole I want players to seek out the hole, you know And be like a Willy coyote prank, yeah, that's a good argument You're thinking of this, right Is this legal Okay, let's say let's say we make it cloth what do I program here If I make the cloth big enough that it just fits over the hole Then I can have it so that we have vertices here and it can move slightly back and Then the vertices at the bottom could move a lot. I Have to program cloth physics with Mario interacting with it That's not gonna be easy I Don't think I can make it look good the more I think about it To make something look like one prop you need to draw part of the wood on the outline. Yes Oh Maybe when Mario approaches it and just flies away Well, there isn't any wind here so well actually there's a little bit of wind here, otherwise the tumbleweed wouldn't move I Don't want to make this feel windy though. You know, I want this to be like the desert like warm I Think just ground pounds a rock here is the most sane and the best option Posted inspo in general This Is what you're thinking And look at my issue with this. It's too obvious Players are going to find this tunnel by accident. I want players to be like there's a bank robbery There is moles going around here. Let's go into the tunnel. I don't want them to be like, oh look this looks fake Let's punch it. I Think it has to be a rock That just looks breakable The bomb cap for once the caps are so underused. Oh, I like the bomb cap idea Maybe we should use the bomb cap Yeah, fuck it let's use the bomb cap and a breakable thing here I Might as well put it here Hmm Let me find level WF it has be paramed for And then the model is model exclamation box, I wonder if maybe we should have a new model exclamation box here Let me just make sure it works on this devil Nice even work your neck. I like three years now something that Is Any questions or thoughts when instead of using a hole in the wall and making a trap door under a boulder Because it's a high dot they don't want people in there That's the song music Right, I forgot I removed the collision here I Think it works Hmm To let scraps work they do Bomb related to Yoshi. Yeah, exactly. We haven't really thought about the issue cards much here So I'm just gonna copy the normal boulder layout here but make one of them look very breakable So no player would think to actually export the other bombs I Have a profiler here if it only works on n64 doll All right How do you I just know I know the entire code base. Of course. I know which code paths I use the most It is pretty obvious if you know the whole code I Know all the codes to did you notice I studied in university. Oh shit. She studied in university. You must be so smart I Have a doctor's degree in movies you should listen to me. I know everything about programming I Use Tracy I Mean, yeah, I use unreal insights at work sometimes It's very helpful. I think it's also called something something trace. So maybe it's the same software Every one of your level we have over anything storylines. No a few of them have but not all of them. I Or overreaching whatever the word is I Think that would be terrible for the game About half of the levels. Okay. See the thing is There are levels with a strong character interactions there are levels with no character interactions and there's levels of story and levels with no story and We can have a mix of all four combinations here Okay Let's make this look very breakable Yeah, we don't want this is disappointed by our breakdown We don't want every level to feel like it's made for Mario We want a lot of them to feel more like they are there and Mario is experiencing them So if you think about it course one has a little bit of story course two, let's say it's all on bubbledome has basically no story Cool, actually, let's say Chris two is Divine Dino domain that's the actual course two and also basically no story But it has a little bit of character in action because free rainbow grotto has a decent bit of character in action course for also course five none course six a little bit Course seven is Koopa Koopa carnival and there's no story here, but there's characters course eight is What the fuck is crusade? Um Right in the freedom tree, it's very platformy the whole thing Chris nine Koopa wave Kov most platforming I think But there's characters you can interact with but you can also just ignore them Kristen fuck what's Kristen? Well, there's also a little bubbledome somewhere in there, I don't remember my Corsair, uh, but yeah But as for levels that feel like they're made for Mario, I think that's just like course one and then Course free The final boss is Bowser, I know huge plot twist I Don't it's pretty much made for Mario to you think so. I thought it wasn't really It's more like a place Mario goes to and then Experiences most things there's really a story either, right? It's just kind of like a village where everyone likes to be a cowboy Trolling he arrives in peace when he leaves Hmm I Guess I guess he contributes to the piece here. Yeah, maybe this is kind of a Mario Maybe We shouldn't rearrange the course order slightly just so that there's a More even pacing of levels that are for Mario and levels that aren't for Mario Because the last three we have plants they're all not for Mario they're all just there And then off this looks so bombable I'm not making a paper Mario model And The last year again the fever dream castle the space casino and Rainbow Reef Two of them are or well, all of them are more like just natural places So I'm thinking maybe we removed it removed the castle like in front of the wild west world Make that course 12 Well, I mean if you think it looks terrible then maybe not but I also don't have another idea I Don't think it would look too terrible though. I feel like we could get a good amount of detail It's been memorable and harder I think Rainbow Reef would be very memorable And also hard depending on how we lay it out I kind of like the parallel to Rainbow Road, you know I Mean I'm fine with trying another idea, but I also do not have another idea Yes, you do get booted out of this time When I hear the song I always understand that he takes a source to the hotel room I Guess I saw full of tiny jazz. Am I gonna look good or run? Well Hmm Maybe I Mean, it's still cool two courses away, right? So maybe we have a new idea by done because it's Course 15 I Am just gonna make a note move wild west to the course 13 and across 12 Just so we know And I've game stuff reconsider course order let's do that I Need to actually like copy this geometry into my level and to my blender editor here Just so I can make it fit properly Yeah, I think this works pretty well And it looks reasonably breakable to me so I'm fine with this Either way we can still think about course 15 by like like I'm completely fine with changing the idea I'm not a hundred percent certain on the Rainbow Reef either. I just thought it was a cool combo. I'm very surreal Either way, I'm done streaming today and I will see you guys in the next stream next Saturday. I hope Bye-bye
