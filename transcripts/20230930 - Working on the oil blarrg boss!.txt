You you god damn it hello guys yes the microphone was mute that was not great awesome lovely as I was saying and you couldn't hear this week was insane I found so many improvements literally I reduced render time by like 5% almost unfortunately there's an optimization I'm working on that doesn't quite work right now but this should also be pretty good OMG is the correct answer 5% is so much I went from like 44 FPS to 46 and I made my engine a lot easier to use so now we can easily add shadows and culling radiuses to everything as you can see things don't have culling radiuses right now it's because I didn't add them yet except for the coins the coins cull correctly but if you look closely at the bunnies you should be able to see them pop in a little bit maybe not whoops maybe you can see the goombas pop in a little bit now I guess the culling radius is still a little too big oh there you can see it there yeah yeah that's pretty evident you love the marionettes that much dude the marionettes is really good I'm really sad that I fucked up today and I accidentally scheduled two videos on the shorts channel for today even though no video at all was supposed to happen because I have a main channel video and that's why it's getting less views than it should but yeah devastating oh well you notice enemies don't have shadows yeah enemies never have shadows in this game because of a fast 64 thing they're really annoying to add in fast 64 but with my new engine it will be very easy to add them everywhere that tree cut really ended up looking cool yeah I wonder who made that any OST wishes for today and we're gonna work on the oil block today true you know just typing one on my chat persona 5 OST honestly yeah let's do that that was a great micro video and tomorrow in the boombox the two hip Koopas always good to see something fresh in your daily yeah the problem is I didn't mean to post them all on the same day well there was another video I accidentally posted today which was a new song in the retro section so that sucks should probably put pizza in the oven sure maybe not actually I don't think pizza is very good for you this song sounds like a shit plots what's going on where were we oh yeah we were at the wave spawning thing let me check out how this makes fun looks like right now let's say I'm a patron you know I'm not and I want to be friend you on this cut how do you know that I'm a patron and some random person you would have to tell me on patreon I don't look at my friend requests if you look at this card right here I have a hundred free requests right there so I just never go there what the fuck Alex behind me oh he also needs a culling radius all right let's give him a cutting radius I haven't I'm back you missed me talking about the sick improvement I made I found like a 5% render speed improvement 600 microseconds yesterday star select stream tonight's shit maybe I think our aspects are in for performance testing reasons yeah I removed them right now just so I can accurately assess performance gains tell me about your microseconds basically culling in my 64 was fucked and I mean right now you can see the culling works correctly right like as soon as it goes off the edge of the screen it gets culled as it should like that as soon as the sender's off screen and basically Mario 64's culling code was like they culled as if the field of view was 45 degrees when an edge currently was 60 degrees and then because they get it wrong they just multiplied it with a random number and added a hundred so they were culling way too few things so I fixed the culling so now everything that's off screen is actually getting culled and I put the culling into the object layout itself no into the object itself not the geo layout and I put the shadow into the object itself so we save two RAM iterations on every object here and culling is correct and that saved like 600 microseconds out of like 22,000 maybe it's like a 3% improvement still that's insane that was not your suggestion didn't I suggest that and then you suggested it again I swear that happened I remember your shadow idea unfortunately your shadow idea didn't work and I don't know why that was an invisible wall that's concerning how did I get an invisible wall? yeah I don't know either there's an invisible wall here somehow what the hell let me check that out real quick this game is not supposed to have invisible walls hello no your shadows I still hate the global lightning node why what's wrong make soft surface look ultra oh I know why it's because you are missing the smoothing nodes the shade smooth node here right here you gotta apply that as well all the soft angles in chris1 look like brick no? chris1 doesn't use global lighting nodes huh I think there's a misunderstanding somewhere oh yeah look that's what the invisible wall was that was just a hole in the floor there we go it was a real invisible wall under the back was talking about new star selects did you send me the files for those funny title all right it uses some form of lighting system then because look at the transitions between grass and grassy walls it looks almost seamless but but it's harsh shadow in-game oh you mean in-game that is weird you mean this year or what are we talking about I'm not sure I understand the problem no I don't support the rumble pack I'll get the blender model it looks so much better all right let me check out this part here I have not touched a gun bunny goombas how close am I to finishing the mod we're missing like four and a half courses so we're like over 70% done at this point  great it's not one ring the grass is in the model yeah it's gonna be honestly my I don't see a difference that looks pretty much the same to me Oh check my friend all right yeah so today i want to take a look at bunny title dot blend it's like the leaf texture used for the leaf path that's fair i feel like there is something better we can do i never really changed it ever since i made them for the first time let me download them real quick basically i said the star select we have is boring as shit so look at this how cool is that i'm not a big fan of you and then this is for koopa with kove honestly yeah that might look better it's mid wow it's way better than what we had before though so this would be really cool i think so that's how you made the video well atlas who's atlas it's an array modifier oh i see that works we'll change it's on the four deaths i don't know them okay let me think about the best way to do this which layers are these on layer one digitally how layer five okay layer one layer one layer one no big deal i can fix this i can fix them all right this should do it smiley clouds yeah honestly maybe my detail what detail did i destroy anything can i say me me me me me me wait did i destroy this biomech what's really mean okay dude one thing i hate about power toys is that when i do alt tab at alt space it does this i do not want to look at bing please so other combiner's fine i did not actually check those out this one looks fine okay that should be fine that's the same one should also be fine i think your combiners are all fine is there a reason the background is so far back do we need that or could i bring it in a bit closer like so and then just shrink it because this will make it a lot easier to program so i think this should work Let me see if I can try to fit things in. Can move around anything as long as it's still in the shot, all right. How's the benchmark looking? I haven't been able to work on it for a bit, but I'm probably going to be back at working on it tomorrow. I like to use scale one. I'm guessing I need to scale it up by a hundred. Oh, this is still so small. How can we handle scale with this? This needs a windmill or other kind of thing for brushworks, maybe some sort of automation. Well, it's supposed to be just like a mood setter, which I guess the windmill fits for the mood setter aesthetic, but still, it's fine. The mushroom texture is different, also clouds. Is the mushroom texture being different an issue, is what I wonder. Instead of the basics, I'll do the models probably when we know how everything will look, yeah. We should probably have this happen once and then everything else should be scaled to exactly to this. Well, actually I should allow a define for how wide it really is here. I think that would make everything easier. It looks odd. Yeah. All right, let's try and import the texture. But the combiner is so different. Maybe that's not so easy. Is this the 8-bit section? No. This is the star select. Yeah, this will be a 60 FPS screen easily. Yeah, each one will have a separate animation, so that's not like an issue. Maybe, yeah, okay, instead of having one geolayout per thing, we'll have one render function per thing and the render function is what decides the geolayout. That's what we'll do. That allows the most flexibility. Texture 0 is too many unique colors to fit the format. I think Biobak meant to do this. Oh, and you definitely should multiply by one instead of texture alpha then. Is this what it's supposed to look like? Material 8. Looks like an i8 anyway. There we go. Some goofy UV mapping in that Mario 3 level clip you showed where square textures weren't square and kind of bendy. Oh, that's not good. I will have to re-upload that video at some point anyway, so that's when we can look at it. What group are you putting this into? Group? Why are you putting them into a group? The official copy will join you in just a second. Everyone asked about Benim, it's probably that annoying guy's alt. What? No way! What do you mean? No way! Sacre bleu, as Biobak would say. No, I think that's someone else. That guy is just a hater for everyone, it's actually funny. Check out his channel, he's just hating on all the Mario 64 people. I need to see it. No, I don't wanna give it any attention. You know, when you have someone who really hates you, you should not engage with them, because it is so easy to just destroy someone. It's way harder to protect yourself. Literally, if you are alive, you could just get a gun somewhere and just murder someone. So that's why you shouldn't poke people that hate you, because they might actually just fucking murder you. It would be easy for them. We live in a time where everyone can just fucking murder anyone if they really wanted to. And that's why you need to put some respect on other humans, because they can murder you. That's the only reason. They don't need to respect their opinions or their views or anything. They're all stupid, but they can murder you. I think we live in times where it's the least likely someone is going to murder you. Yes, but if someone was really setting out to murder you, it's easier than ever to actually do that. Shit, I need to have an array of functions. Wait, so next thing, someone's going to murder you. Yep, yep, yep. Okay, I've already read that. Let's talk to the idiot people liking yourself should be better than people hating you. Yeah, yeah. Is it a Yoshi story block? I have not looked at it. We should have a random nothing function just to be safe. Okay. Um, I'm just going to ask you to define an array of functions that are structured like void function name, void funnel. You murdered Skelinio, you ruined his life. Honestly, Lukashi has been writing me on Twitter as if he thinks that we are the boys. You know what I mean? We done boys? All right, that works. Skelinio army, let's go. Has he even done anything against SM645? He's been a public nuisance since then. He showed you his masculine energy. No, not you too, Leela. Your crush said she fucking hate you. Look, if a girl says you're stupid, that means she likes you. That's how that's like girls always say that. You're so stupid. That's my girl impression. That means they like you.  I am an expert. Facts. It is facts. Depends on the person. It's facts, Leela, I'm sorry. Okay. Good start. And ironically, that's what we wanted to happen. This is exactly, oh, we're done? Nice. When she says get away from me, it actually means she wants to get in bed with you. No, unless you're Skelinio, then you might think that. Actually, I don't know if Skelinio does that. Too far. He did not do that to anyone. I'm sorry. That is not what happened. I should not have said that. So, we should have an array of like act selectors. Objects. It's just a guy from a long, long time ago. Funny guy. I don't know exactly why we're talking about them. Oh, I know why we're talking about them. Because he has like these young fanboys. I don't know where he's finding them. But one of them tagged me on Twitter like a week ago and was like, you ruined my friend's life. And I had no idea what the guy was talking about. And I never actually talked to Skelinio. So, it's like a really weird thing to say to me, you know. Okay, here's the thing. I want to store a few state infos here. But I don't want the state infos to clock up my RAM. I want them to be somewhere separate. Because all the act selector things, they're not used. So, where can we store these variables? Tell me stupid ones. Yeah, that happens. I know what we do. I know what we do. Oh. So, now like obj exists function. Hmm. Hello, HedgehogGamer. Oh, shit. That's two Hedgehogs. BoycatKazimano. Yeah, he was spamming that hashtag at me. Yes, this is dirty. We are spawning the second background as just like an unidentified object hitbox. Just so we can discern between these two somehow. How much are these apart again? 2619. If I did everything right, we should have these spawned now. But they should look very offset from what we want. Graciana means that she doesn't want to go on with you, right? I don't. What? Fuck. That did not do what I want. I know why. Damn. Also not what I want. Dude, these rainbows look funny. This is interesting. Do they start glowing when I... Oh, no. The glow goes forward. That's why. Interesting. Have I tried programming it to do what I want? No, I have not. Hmm. Maybe this is a culling thing Is a decent looking background plane shift effect possible? Of course. I don't know what that is, but of course it's possible. What happened? We are trying to make the new star select work. I might have to get my Xbox controller to work and use an emu real quick. I think this is not gonna work out without an emu. What the hell? Oh, I see. That makes sense actually. So this isn't even loaded while we are here. That's very very good actually. I did not know that.  So I move Garda to the buffers I think. What the hell? Runtime error? Interesting. Okay, so this function runs. But what the hell is this code? I heard a Yoshi noise. So this is where it's finding the object. Why is it only doing one of them? Oh shit! I know why. They shouldn't fix it, but that is definitely a bug I found just now. You can't download it yet, it's still in beta. I just have access to it, it's like a beta tester. Okay, so the objects spawn, but they are not being shown. Because they are probably in a bad position. Send 64 for debugging? I have never heard of that. Maybe I should just look at where the act selector stars go usually. This is getting stupid. Shit. 0, minus 100, 0. So I probably need to move this way down. What?  Is this a bad model or something? Is the model not loaded yet? Wait, how does this work? Did I falsely assume that the act selector plays? Set current level. Yeah, I think we set the current level and then after that we actually load the level. So the object isn't loaded yet. That's not good. We might have to make a custom segment here. This might end up being a lot more work than I thought it would. Menu segments. Let's try that.  Is there any jumps in here? Nope. You've never seen a cum man. Oh, it's back. I was on Discord with Robot and Arthur yesterday and I figured out... I didn't know about this, but Robot thinks cum is so funny. It's actually funny how much he just enjoys cum. It's funny. Cum is funny. I got the vibe that he just chuckles at the idea of cum. You know what I mean? Shit, I need to make clean. I got the vibe just now. Yeah. See, I used to think that he thought puns with cum were funny. But now I have the feeling that the idea of cum is already funny to him. Okay, I see something. Okay. I was planning to make a video about it. Someone's gonna play it and record my gameplay. It's visible for one frame. And then it disappears. That is weird. It shouldn't be like this. Okay. Okay.  Didn't you guys see Joe Biden falling off his bike? I didn't play B3313. I watched 15 seconds of gameplay of it. And it kinda ruined my entire motivation to play the game. The level I saw looked like shit. I thought it was gonna be like Mario 64 levels, but endless and weird. But it just looks like garbage. What? Didn't that happen 5 years ago? What? That's sad. Maybe I just saw the worst level in the game. Oh! We have a little bit of level down here for some reason. This was the better game. No, what I didn't like about it had nothing to do with how it's better. What I didn't like about it was just how bad it looked. It didn't look like the beta, it looked like Baby's First Sketchup Project. What did the level look like? It was like a huge grassy plain. And in the grassy plain there was a mountain. It looked like the gameplay in the level was Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! And then you are to go. But you do that 15,000 times. I think I might have to make this bigger. There we go.  I guess I struggle so much with this. It's got nothing to do with it being centered, Leela. Look, this isn't being centered. And look how far off the center it is. It's not that simple. I have no idea why it acts like this. Couldn't you just make it bigger? That's what I just did. Case issue. No! It's just not that easy. I don't want there to be a gap so I'm just going to do this. I'm struggling to get the new debug to work on the emu. How does that help? I don't know. I'm not struggling at it. What are you guys talking about? It's almost perfect already. Just look how it's not centered. Weird stuff. I think I have to move it up a bit. It is just a trial and error thing. There's nothing I can do. Okay, I need to move this down again a little bit. It's because of the origin of the camera. Just like when the game positions the camera makes this difficult. Is this screen the way we want the Biobak? Or is there something wrong with this? Let me check your video again. In your video the strings are way higher up. And the stars are too. I think that's the big issue here. I also show a lot more of the model at the same time. Don't I? If I compare this... No, it's roughly the same. This is all good. But it looks less tall on your end. Does that make sense? It looks vertically squashed compared to what we have here. Oh yeah, that's why we show more. Yeah, that definitely makes a difference. Still, it's weird that on the left side there's too much and on the right side there isn't. Wait, it's not. Yes, it is. Wait, what the fuck? This is what we see. Wait a second. Oh, I see. That makes sense. Let's try that again. Simply press and unprint 0. Does that turn off orthogonal mode? There we go. Now we just need to scroll it. Okay. Actually, I think we need three of them, right? Is two of them enough? Is two of them enough? I think no. Two of them is not enough. We need three. Okay. Just use the array modifier. Don't try to add code for it. How's the array modifier gonna help, Leela? The problem is that it's scrolling. It's gonna scroll. It's gonna go out of the screen. The array modifier doesn't do what I want. Ah. That was a pretty German R. I'm making the animation in code, but Biomech has made an animation in Blender before that we used in the guideline. I also don't like that it's black at the beginning, you know? Yes, you can use the array modifier, then warp position at specific points. Yeah, but I don't want that. I just want free object scrolling. That's way easier than using the array modifier. If we use the array modifier, we're gonna have three times the geometry for no benefit. You're gonna shit up my ROM. Fair enough. Streamer has a mental breakdown, fair enough. I know this competition is going to be exploitative but it is pretty bad for me.     Let's talk Gamer. Hell yeah. Oh fuck. There's a line here. Oh no. Oh god, oh god. He's right behind me, isn't he? Maybe it stops rendering? Nope. The tiling is just not correct. And it's because this is supposed to be free and not 2. It seems we still have an issue. Oh but it disappears after a bit. Nevermind, it's there. Is it just me or does it sometimes stop? Or is it like the speed varying because the emulator can't render as fast? What do we think of the position of the text and the logo? I feel like the text could go further down. Text is not centered. Shit, it's slightly off-centered now. I think the text is a bit hard to read on the background. But yeah, I agree. Everything down a bit. I think the mission text should be down but not the stars. The thing is, this has to work with everything. This also has to work here. I guess the mission text can be down here on this level. And here. It can also be down here. But that's not really what Biobak envisioned. I think Biobak just wants it cut out, right? 13096, it should be fine. I don't know why it doesn't work out fine. Well, we would have to scroll and stuff and nothing on it, but I'm not sure it's possible. There's still a thing here. I see what you mean, yes. Okay, it seems that the seam is gone. What if default, level, level, default. I think the seam came from this. Because it was exactly 10, which is what the speed is. Which means that one update was delayed by a tick. There we go, we fixed the root cause. I mean, okay, I can move everything down. But I think the problem is that your layout just assumes everything to be further up. So our two ideas here is first, move everything up slightly. Second, keep the stars where they are, keep the logo where it is and move the text down. And only move the mission text? Yeah, I think that mission, that option is preferable too. Mission text is way too big. I did make it a lot bigger than it usually is, yeah. Oh, but honestly, this is very chill to me. Why is the act name X here? No wonder it's off-center, it's off-center at Mario 64. Why did I make it off-center? It still doesn't feel centered, does it? Maybe I need to add the letter width to it? I don't know. Yeah, it made it worse. It's really weird. I think it might just be being computed right now wrong with the kerning. Or... Oh my god, these letters. Why is this unused? I don't think we need this. This is scaled up by 1.5. Let me just check to make sure that this works. Center screen width divided by 2, right? Yeah. But, like, on this name, you can really tell that it's slightly off-center. 4 centimeters to the left. 6 centimeters to the right. That's an issue. Gong sound effect, classic case stream occurrence, I agree. Oh, this is why. This is not actually using the kerning. Okay, the thing is, I invented better kerning. Wait, what the fuck? Okay, this is useless. Basically, I invented better kerning, and this is not used here. We just take the length here. I invented kerning, yes. I'm sorry, guys, but I did. I invented kerning. Okay. What? StringPose, not XPose. What is your issue with my scale, huh? Text pointer should be string. Yeah, I just copied code without fixing the naming. Whoops. There we go. Now it should be moved slightly to the right, because we use better kerning. All right, all right, all right. 160 better fucking work, otherwise I'm going to be so mad. What do you guys think? Yay or nay? Did I fix it? Still not centered. You think it's still off by three? I can just add the three back. See if that works. Windows Empty check. All right. Did you troll me? That's what Windows Empty did. Then buy it back to troll me, guys. Windows Shift them. Is this going to explode my penis? 234. 241. You know what? That is close enough. Let's be real. It's within measuring error. Let's check the star. 180. 150. Wait, so it's too far to the right. If anything. 161.  188. 140. What the fuck? 227. Wait, I made it worse. God damn it. 164. This one is good. Turn on project 64. Fine. 234. 245. God damn it. 172. You know what? This is the best we're going to get. We just have to accept that there's going to be a little bit of inaccuracy until we have the final kerning in. I think the star selection is beautiful. What do you guys think? I really like it. The thing is, scaling the text down is not going to be easy. It's going to look really bad on N64 if we have another scale. Because this is 1.5. I think 1.5 is acceptable. Usually you'd want 2 or 1. Having a number between 1 and 1.5 is going to be awful. I'm pretty sure. I don't want to add sand or clouds. I think it's good that you can see everything so easily here. Stars slightly up. I think I agree with that. It's kind of looking a bit empty. I don't think it should look full. Because then we want a clean background here. It's too high up. Maybe a gradient. There is a gradient. Perfect. For sure. I think up here is good. Actually I kind of don't want it to touch the logo there. Let's try 40. They should be some guy angry. Okay, there is one more issue here. What the fuck is this? Like why why is this happening I go in and then it's black and we see the logo and then boom can you bring the cool star effect to these the cool star effect you mean the rainbow and all that what do you mean fix it for widescreen you know what's wrong for widescreen here the shine is off oh I have to shine off on purpose here because the shine looks really bad here I don't think the star should be more animated just the screen shouldn't get too busy it should just set the mood the logon text on a widescreen is just it it looks good though I think it's good the way it is we might want to add clouds but I kind of want to keep the sky free how can you be sure it will look good once you do it hey who says I wasn't gonna adjust it at all just leave it as is what's wrong with it hmm I really dislike the pop-in that happens here that's my biggest issue with this I think we need to run our code elsewhere this music fucking sucks dude do you guys think we can start arguing about bitcrunch music the same way we argue about pixel art it'll look really nice if it faded into the sky color then a model flies in from the bottom when the stars enter I don't know how doable it is I don't know how doable it is hmm that is doable I can't do that what make my jump a bit easier as well fix this real quick don't call it bitcrush music that's what it is I broke it oh I know why I can make it fly in from below I think no if I want to make it fly in from below I should know okay I have an idea on how to make it fly in from below but before I can come implement that idea I need to make it so that it instantly spawns do you prefer C++ or blueprints that is like a mentally ill question holy shit no you can't just put a question like that out it's fucking wild to ask that do you prefer C++ or blueprint let's think it's like imagine you go to a restaurant and you ask the chef if he like prefers to eat soup with a spoon or like a shovel so like yeah a spoon and a shovel superficially they look similar but they have two very different purposes nothing wrong with blueprints what do you mean blueprints are not for programming blueprints are there to like store asset info and implement special stuff without duplicating your C++ classes you can make a full yeah you can also drink a full soup with a shovel I programmed that MIPS assembly for way too long most indie devs will use blueprints for more than C++ fuck him honestly fuck him they have problem you know what pigs they like to roll around on dirt I'm not gonna stop them let them have fun let them roll around on dirt so see that's so easy why would I ever use a powerful visual scripting language okay now the programming and blueprints if you actually try to make a program blueprints it's gonna be slower it's gonna be less performant it's gonna take a lot longer to program it's gonna be more limited it's gonna just make a blueprint spaghetti salad that no one but you can read and you probably won't be able to read this anymore either after a bit well okay when I asked what's that I'm not saying oh I don't know what this is explain this concept to me I'm asking what do you think it is just so we can be on the same page you know what I mean gopium that is not gopium that is pure facts this is interesting it's all rotated wrong so I wonder what the opinion is concerning yet um the object-oriented part about it is mildly annoying that's all so it doesn't really bother me that much I mean it's kind of useful kind of handy to just like things easier have like conventions in place makes it so that a lot of communication just kind of works out oh shit whoops so all right let's see if it spawns any earlier now still doesn't spawn early enough so I'm thinking we should just have a function call to a function that runs this once  whatever the subsection menu thing we are right now working on improving it I know it doesn't look like it's gonna be improved but trust so oh all right that's almost there the one issue i have with it is that it stops for a short bit what is going on in this neck of the woods neck of the woods wood does not have a neck what is the neck of a wood i'm getting so many warnings here that i want to remove so value computed but not used why is that an issue that's annoying actually geoact select scroll should just go at this point i guess this is already like for sure gone google it i'm not googling what the neck of a wood is okay how do you call the function while it's sleeping is that not possible single stadium i still don't want to google it okay fine neck of the woods thanks it's the third studio album by los angeles alternative rock band silver sun pickups well awesome why did i go to images because this is funny i hate you platonically fair uh what is this if death hey no segmented memory i don't think i use this dude it could have been worse than porn it could have been evangelion music nothing against evangelion music but last time we accidentally played evangelion music the entire stream got nuked dude this is absolutely peak programming it's still pausing what is that how else would i do this leela it doesn't even work i'm just trying to get the function here to run i think this will just freeze my level script current ROM size is around 46 megabytes oh there we go make it fly up so it pauses our screen well we're gonna have this issue with every level going forward so i don't want to do that but yes it is time to make it fly upwards What is the sum of all numbers from 40 to 40 no from 0 to 40 it's 820 how did you do that in your hat I am fucking insane oh what do you think biomech a bit more it's a cheat there isn't it yeah you just do 40 multiple by 41 and divided by two that is not how it's supposed to go well this should be like 800 by 81 divided by 2 right 3000 what really it's like twice that whoops no and then by 2 again 1620 what am I doing wrong this time that's weird this should be way too high now oh wait how is the d-cell 0.f oh this is why it didn't work I might have to extend the top shit shit shit shit shit shit shit why is the d-cell 0 I meant to put it to 0.5 there we go is that what you want biomech I like this it looks nice it's it's such a mood to do the imagine entering this level for the first time imagine you come from Mario 64 and then you haven't you all whatever that's gonna be in this is not the overworld and you're like all you're all innocent you think I was just gonna be a normal game and then you see this and then you enter the level and the cuts in place oh that's gonna be so impressive it's finally done the materials do not need to match I think it's kind of charming that they don't you the 60fps is also gonna be like holy shit yeah and I knew otherwise I will cry honestly that'd be kind of funny isn't Mario sunshine 60fps wait what I thought it was sunshine is 30fps huh I think that's insane wait a second I'm pretty sure we can render sunshine levels at 30fps on the n64 me yeah it's gonna be difficult with the f3d x3 microcode and some insane optimization like to the level geometry and the culling and potential visibility I'm pretty sure we could render Delfino Plaza at 30 maybe not all of it at once but like it would be playable can you end of the water no the water is gonna be impossible there's no I mean maybe someone has like an insane idea for it but I don't see a way this yeah that would be an insane video would you be mad if I ban the guys I'll do that bet I would cry all night I would I would make an alt and I would go into our discord and I would ask why my alt got banned and my friend I'm not optimizing sunshine I don't wanna okay well back to what we were working on unless Biobak sends me another one right away we wanted to work on the fucking block today no my friend is getting banned from my discord and he did nothing other than be really fucking annoying and ruin the experience for everyone there was no rule against that how was I supposed to know that's not allowed don't you have two more and he didn't send them to me yet oh man this sucks I got banned for being annoying okay how do we make the oil wave look like it's gonna be like like an actual wave that like drops off to the sides let's try and model this on top of here no I would not be mad but now you shouldn't do that that'd be the funniest prank of all time you'd be such a legend for pulling off such an insane prank when actually people would be mad about the gift because they expected a bigger gift damn but why how do you justify being mad at that I don't wanna okay well back to what we were working on unless Biobak sends me another one right away we wanted to work on the fucking block at this point you might ask yourself has case ever seen a wave in his life the answer is yes they live by the coast for 25 years 20 when did I move to Canada that I only live in Germany for 25 years damn yeah the city I live in it's like right at the sea we had a sealed station in our town when Zeyna was over here I took her to see the seals well over there not over here they were like rescuing seals over there look I hate the song look I am going to die of cringe because I hate the song you think that's a decent wave shape I'm still not sure what the texture should be though it's gonna be the hard part picking a good texture here it should be pure oil though so annoying is it kinda like how I hate that Mario Galaxy 2 song with the one guy who's just like mishandling his instruments doing bad things to it should have a separate menu file here I think our songs fucked up Yoshi of the week let's see it no yeah I am aware of this song I'm thinking something like this for the wave I guess although the mirroring has to go the mirroring will go does it go if I apply not really enough of that Wait, Lost Impact became 7 years old today? That's crazy That's the best system for moving the camera in small increments I've seen so far Oh, what is it? How does it work? Pretty good, Luigi's Mansion 64 hack That's funny that you're calling it that Hold R to move the camera freely, if you don't hold R it snaps to the 8 directions Oh, I don't want the 8 directions to be known at all to the player in this game here That's the thing I think you only should make the 8 directions visible as a thing existing in the world to the player at all if your level is actually aligned to the 8 directions And that's just not the case for anything in this game Well, the boss fight arena, yes Maybe this is level part 2, but like most levels, no I think this works as a wave You know what we need to do? We need to program a hitbox for the Blark I just realized we should do that first And we also need to program fading out when you fall down If we decided on what happens here, I think you're supposed to take damage And here you're supposed to fade out Let's program the fade out first and then program the damage there And then we can move on I think your system is annoying because sometimes you want to move just a level and it flicks to the side No, if you want to move it slowly here Okay, you don't actually notice, but I actually changed the system So if I hold C, it still moves in a 90 degree increment If you want to move it slightly, the only option you have is D-pad And it goes like this And if you hold it, it moves further Or it starts to accelerate So if you want to move it just a slight bit, you tap it once The thing is, in this game, if you press R, you center the camera Behind you so i don't want r to do anything and i don't want to add any button combos to do stuff because like it starts to feel less like a game and more like a tool you know how like blender with like complicated shortcuts i think i want to stick to the one button one output philosophy let me just make sure the area works at all what the fuck make r crash the game that's the stupidest idea i've ever heard yeah i'll definitely play it shit i think we need the dino dino domain background next because i need to make a dino dino domain preview soon i think i need to make it so that in the interpolation frames objects update their floor heights because what i saw just now looked really bad like this is not acceptable so this level does look pretty hard so is there a better way to store brightness than this this is sh sh sh i guess it could be slr sh there's actually a speed so one thing i didn't think about this uh if you fall down here and you fade out where should you respawn because i want mario to respawn when you fall but i also don't want him to respawn like right on the edge here see a ratchet can down well so i also don't want him to just respawn in the center of the level i want him to respawn in some reasonable place what if he marked a few specific locations and moved mario to the closest one i don't like that either checkpoints it's kind of what we did in the bird level kind of works here i feel like there's a smart idea we can do somehow what does something like mario odyssey do when it disappeared culling don't worry about it easy to fix so what if we mark the last non-object triangle mario stood on moved him into the middle and if the middle is blocked which we can test with the raycast from above i guess then we move from somewhere else will that lead to oddities the middle of the triangle will always be kind of close to the end of the triangle that's a good thing or or maybe what would be better we take mario's position restore mario's position and the last triangle he was on next we find the closest vertex on the triangle he was on and move him from that vertex some amount of coordinates into the middle of the triangle so like if i was on here last would likely like move me here i'm back what happened we're thinking about how to program the fade out for mario here basically we want mario to fade out and respawn if you fall into the sauce so but i don't want mario to spawn inside geometry like right here if we place mario into the middle of the triangle he would just respawn in the in the carrier there the problem is some triangles might be so small that it doesn't work so the peaches for your problem exactly it worked mostly for peaches fury except for like one or two places so the idea was to like find a vertex on the triangle that is closest to mario's last position on the triangle and move mario like 100 coordinates into the middle of it towards the middle of it rather just ignore the smaller triangles i think that'd be a bit weird too because now it would feel so random whether you get respawned or not like if you jump down from here i guess it would make sense that that's not the same spot there maybe we should only take the big triangles yes it's pretty easy to check if there's a triangle above the one mario's on so but like let's say we're here we would still want this to be a safe location despite there being a triangle above me put them directly on the vertex that puts you in a pretty dangerous position nobody would want to respawn like right here that's a shitty respawn position we do need to move mario like into the middle of it there's also probably like what if you stand here and jump down and then the inside position is like inside there just start the last non-airborne position but you need to start the last triangle because i don't want the player to like do that and then like respawn on the edge makes sense so can we store the last position that is like at least 50 coordinates away from a triangle edge that's what i'm thinking that's that's a really good way of doing it the problem is that it might detect like a triangle edge like here because it's pretty close so it would feel weird it would feel like there's a little bit of randomness to it which i don't like i don't want there to feel like there's any randomness to it i think triangles in general is just a problem because it always feels like there's a randomness to it the problem is we would have to check this at the time of triangle rosetta which means we check like all the triangles every frame and that's way too expensive respawn points yeah the question is how would we decide respawn points because like if you fall down here we need to make absolutely sure that mario never respawns around here because we wouldn't want the player to make progress by falling down let me check the triangle mario is currently above that has the randomness problem i mentioned  have the mario logo flag again no that that doesn't fit into a normal course that's like a linear level thing no this will only appear in linear levels  triggers are on response points where you can activate them we can do that yes we'd have to have quite a few respawn points hmm we might have to make them really big so that the player's guaranteed to hit them this is a close you might as well use flags no not flags definitely not absolutely not i hate the idea of flags so but there's also a problem like here you can get up here so many ways that making a checkpoint anywhere on here you would just never hit it so save the last checkpoint i was in anytime he ends up above a pit i need to make pretty big hitbox areas for that and i don't want that either i think our best option is still something to do with the last triangle mario was on maybe we should just check the last triangle to see if it's big enough and if it is big enough then that's like a valid respawn location for mario and then we have places like this no distance from edge i think distance from edge is to play we find the triangle mario's on we see if mario's distance from the edge is bigger than like a certain threshold if it's bigger than the distance from the edge this is a valid respawn point get closer to the last triangle what that makes no sense what do we even get the respawn point for if we go to the triangle chain of checks until you find a valid point no no no we check the location to be valid every tick and if it's not valid we just don't break it up um actually let's do like free of copy so we back mario's position up here let's do a few checks okay this is actually something that chat gpt is insane at i'll just ask it um give me a code that takes a position and checks if the and checks closest distance to any edge of the tri of a triangle this position is on you can assume that the position is within the triangle might do that all right mario bye bye from zero percent to 100 70 i'd say you played last impact for the first time that's nice the hack is seven years old so this is gonna be a lot better it gave me a code let's check if it's any good um oh this is multiple triangles what the fuck did it try to do okay it only does the x and the y position that's good i do not understand the math here no not all of them just this level here oh the triangle is just an array of three points i see so yeah this code is honestly fine so so so um case needs to think like a triangle true so much for watching and please like and subscribe Do not try this at home, unless you know exactly what you're doing. Oops, wrong button. Oh, I misspelled you Mario, stay at core. Um, I should print this distance just so I can test this. This should print the distance to the triangle I'm on, if chatgpd gave me the right code. What doesn't seem to be working for me, huh? Is it hard to get VS Code to correctly do arrow highlighting? I don't know. Dude, it fucking works. That is so insane. You guys have no idea how hard that would have been to program by myself. And this is why I like chatgpd. Who has edge detection algorithms memorized? In fact, I know how come I'm not in chatgpd. What isn't your place then the mistake was this real quick and the believes them because I know I don't the way you are and that the belief that fifth to so that mario is not gonna fall down on respawn oh lila really you got what was coming to you how unexpected i feel so bad for you now  peril uses on the 15th update of the day i'm sure it will be good now so at least we had updates that's a bad thing do you use windows update do you have them on i do beat her that's called based well i definitely should reset mario's velocity as well okay so if i did everything right then right here my position will store good and then when i jump on this thing and then off it should not store whoops hey it didn't start cool hey it works hey definitely need to reset velocity and all that is it optimized still it's pretty optimal i mean i don't need this here so i can just return right here and it will be fine so i don't need to alternate that it's not an expensive algorithm to run it's very cheap so oh wait it needs to be this way around because as soon as it's more than the minimum distance it's no longer valid hello undefined zero so so so so so so so what's a good action stage here do you think after recording this video just typing in anyone can do it just remember the codes well that is actually one way to learn programming if you're like incapacitated in some way if you have like a learning disability you can still just memorize everything i don't recommend learning programming that way but it's theoretical theoretically possible to read me i actually do have set up coding guidelines and all that everyone would be a stretch i mean to varying degrees i think everyone could kind of do it so so geo set penis color maybe maybe i did that maybe that's one of the guidelines so what the hell i don't like how far bar goes back here it shouldn't go that far back the camera should also warp so this is not a good action act death excellent should be it i think this is good because this one doesn't move mario and i think this needs to be 11 and the camera needs to spawn is this if you're happy and you know it clap your hands well this is unused and this is unused cool so this should warp the camera so but i need to move the collision down here god i hope my level still compiles after this there's people who can pay you tons of money to code like thousands a week how many thousands so the easiest code is making checkpoints probably that is a lot better than checkpoints oh that's not what i want you don't know damn what is this one cool not what i want falling death exit i'm just gonna try all the death exits one of them is gonna work i'm sure maybe not hmm how's there no knockback oh it's just kb i don't like any of these what is the action state after you do a spin jump steep jump i see that should work this is no air control nothing you only pay 1.6k and you'll pay 86k damn shit i don't like the animation and i also want to store mario's jaw and falling off actually i don't need to i think this is fine let's not go with this like water jump i want something that knocks mario back but doesn't actually move him i think this might work i think this does have a little bit of knockback but so little that we're still always guaranteed to land within the triangle huh why does mario sometimes just teleport over there oh god it's because the home position is never actually saved it's because we never move anywhere interesting so we gotta do that that also explains why that happened with the deathwarp sometimes i thought that was a warp mode thing but on second thought that doesn't really make too much sense cool i put these in the wrong order nice  57k that's not enough it can't buy my soul for 57k oh Okay, with this knowledge I think we should try the devops again. Yeah, I hear of programmers being paid like 200.000 or 400.000 in big companies. Okay, the animation is great, but I do not like the damage and the mama mia. Let's try anything with this animation here. What else is this? Definitely not submerged. No. I think the death accident animation is the one I want. Venom fallover backwards, yes. What is this? Velocity. What are these fucking arguments? This is so weird. Working head to Bitcoin? What? That makes no sense. That's supposed to be decentralized. An exchange? Yeah, that's like the ultimate selling your soul. Cool, cool. Interesting. Yeah, I think it has to be this. This should work. And maybe this 250. You can make a billion dollars? Damn, I'm selling my soul. Honestly, maybe I should put it higher because you might be holding forward still and I don't want the player to do stuff. I also don't like that the camera turns like that. That's bad. That's very, very bad. What about moving platforms? What about them? I could add oil stains on Mario, but that'd be a very expensive effect. Checking a pen close up on Mario and make quick animation of him wiping himself off. That would be very cool. There's another piece of code I need here for sure. Where are... maybe Piranha Army? It does something to the... no, it doesn't. Shit. I think this is what I want. Just making sure Mario doesn't go under. Oops. I don't know where he should go. Really? Game devs only make 60k on average? Damn. Being a game dev sucks, huh? Hello, Sile. Alright, that is closer to what we want. Because I don't want the camera to go under the oil. I want the camera to just kind of point down at the oil and have it be like, look, there goes Mario. That's what you did to him. Kind of like that, yeah. And I want the rotation to stay the same. So if it's like this, I want it to stay like this, I think. Okay, that works. That doesn't work. Why is this happening? The respawn wouldn't do anything different on moving platforms. Well, actually, no, you have a good point. I should just turn it off. I was thinking of this before, but yeah. It should just not work on objects. Hello, cute kitty. Will it really be hard to add oil to Zimzalabim? The easiest way to do that would be to make a decal, like a thing that is only decals that render, and to render it on top of Mario. That's the most performant way, because it would only be there for a bit. And then we just render a second Mario on top of the normal Mario. And we can do it, actually. The problem is, if we ever add a Mario in the future, we'll also have to add a decal Mario. And that's the part that sucks. It just replaces textures? Okay, which textures? Do you see the issue? There are no textures. And then also, how is the transition from oily to not oily? Do we just... snap it? I'm fine with decals, actually. But we have to do that at the end. I can make a node. Let's make a node here. Like a general node, actually. Under new features. Add a decal Mario object that can render in the exact same place as normal Mario and takes a material into transparency. You can fade this decal in slash out to render effects over Mario. It'd be very cool, actually. No, we're not leaving footprints. Actually, it's possible, but it's too much. We're not doing that. I still don't like the camera snapping like that. That is my biggest issue with this. I wonder if we can just do this. This might work. But why do you need one? I don't need one, but it's gonna be cool. And with the way I just described, it's basically free. Shit. This was a bad idea. It looks like it always renders from the origin. I think Mario should play the quicksand death animation when entering the oil. The oil is moving so much, though. How do you do that? Where would Mario be while this happens? Why are we initializing all this? This is useless. Well, not all of it, but most of it. I'm fine with initializing the pen, but the others? No. What if I just copy this? This would obviously be a terrible code to just put here. But I'm thinking if this works, we can apply this to more things. We can just make a function for it. If it works. It should now be behind Mario. Oh, that worked. That worked. That did not work. This is really weird. Oh wait, no, it just keeps its jaw now. That's what we want. No, this is good. This is maybe better than spawning it behind Mario. I think this is the least disorienting way to do it. See, the camera just keeps its angle now. Or maybe the position should just be exactly where... It should be so that you look at where you just died. I think that's the best. I don't know. I don't know. This is the death animation. Alright. And then maybe we have this be a little bit longer. Because that would look nicer. Something wrong at 757. How do we just have an end floor pointer here? What the fuck? How did it just implicitly assume what that was? That is actually really scary. It must have a global variable named floor or something. So now when I fall down here... Well, that's the opposite of what I wanted. Yeah, it looks like it's doing the opposite of what I want. But this will work. Perfect. I just need to invert this. Minus. Plus. Minus. And plus. Had the Mario drowning sound? Honestly, yes. I like that sound. I like that sound. I haven't really thought too much about the sound stuff yet. Huh. I guess we need to include data.h. But I do want to have a polish phase at the end when we add VFX and SFX to everything. Let's hear the sound with it. It's not bad. I think it's pretty neat. And it always shows exactly where you just died. So there should be as little disorientation as possible. More delay and more damage? Hmm. More delay. I mean more damage. Yeah, maybe. The delay seems fine to me. Alright, just falling through the oil is kind of weird. Yeah. Well, it's not solid oil. It's also water. Hug and fall don't instantly kill you like they did. I just didn't program it that way. Either way, I think I'm done for today. Next time hopefully we can actually program the bark. Although I think Biomech is going to have another star select for us to program. I'll see you guys next stream. Bye bye.
