Oh, hello, hello. Hello, Rick Luton. Hello, Edmund. Hello, Edmund. Did he finish Iron Marrow? Yep, I finished it. He finished with 10 stars. Gamers, you're calling me gay? Hello, Nihal Nina. Hello, Deluxite. Hello, Tea Time. You want to play Iron Marrow? No? This is not a gameplay stream, this is a... ...searching out the overworld type stream. So this overworld is massive. Really, really massive. You're just bugging me? Alright. So I've noticed your joking in RomShack has gotten... ...a little out of hand. To put it lightly. I think you need to get that back under control. What did Sauron do? Nothing in specific, just a bunch of cringe jokes. Yep, we're working on the overworld today. What do you mean, the overworld? What do you mean? What do you mean, what do you mean? What are you talking about? Will this overworld still be YoshiShaped? I believe so, yes. Right now I'm working on the general shape of the overworld... ...and then we're going to start honing in on the individual areas. Let's make a folder for it. Unique overworld. On the last canon shot of retro section, you should add a rainbow circle to show where to shoot. I know it'll be a generous shot, but still, after such a long section, you wouldn't really get... Yeah, I agree. What will I do or put on the overworld? The 15 main course entrances. The 4 cap statues. So far, 5 side levels. I'm thinking special events that randomly happen. So one event I was thinking is that there was going to be a pirate invasion in the overworld. I think that would be really cool. 5 side levels. Well, 5 side levels are planned though. I don't think you missed anything. So far, 5 side levels are planned. There might end up being more, I don't know yet. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.   I'm not sure.   I'm not sure. Hello Mario64. Hello from Minecraft. Minecraft? What? I don't know what that means. That doesn't look very Yoshi like. Maybe you can add an image of one as an overlay since Blender has that feature. I don't think I want it to be a perfect Yoshi shape, otherwise you would be onto something here. Yeah. I also found that there is no real silhouette that looks exactly like what I want here. I think he's getting close to being done with it. What do you mean? What do you mean?  Can't forget that this needs to be a bay here. It needs to be like this. This looks pretty poor, but maybe if I google Yoshi silhouette, I'll have a better picture here. Oh I see. This is certainly one mistake I made. Far away from where I need to be? I don't know. Let me just work on my game please. I don't want to think about that type of stuff. Let me just make him just a little better. Hello Asuku. What makes better chocolate chips than Germany? I have no idea. I have no idea where the chocolate I ever eat from comes from. It's going to be the shape of a Yoshi island, however Yoshi had. But the island is going to be so big that it is unrealistic that anyone would be able to tell it by just playing the game. So this is going to be 13 parts of an overworld. Actually 12 parts. One part will be underground and two parts will be above ground. So for now, we just kind of cut this up to parts. And then once we have that cut up, we can make the individual parts work as levels. There's a bit of what I planned. Sure, sure. So, 13 parts to this overworld. This is the general plan. Maybe you guys have some ideas on how to improve it as well. Yes, this is the overworld which functions as the hub world. Part one, this is going to be a cliffside beach. Part one is down here. You see the area that's disappearing here and appearing this part down here. Let me get a red pen. Right here, that's part one. Part one is going to be kind of like a cliffside beach. This is where you arrive on Yoshi's Island. It is going to be blocked off to part two by one of Bowser's gates. And this is where you find the orange sleeping Yoshi. It's going to have the entrance to Bunny Brushwoods right here. You can just enter it right away. And then it's going to have a locked entrance to course two where you will need one star to enter it. I'm not sure if there's going to be any side levels here yet. But mainly this is just your landing spot. And after you collect, I think, four stars, you can enter part two. Part two is like a path like this. Maybe like some mountains, like a mountainy trail. And it's going through Yoshi's Island here. It's like a long mountain path that leads to another side of Yoshi's Island. On this mountain path, you will see Bowser's mines. This is where Bowser is forcing the Yoshis to work or whatever. We actually haven't finished the story yet, which is something we need to think about as well. Right, we need to think about the story and we need to think about the final Bowser level. Yeah, we want this to be tropical. This mountain trail also has the entrance to course three where a bunch of mice are mining. And they need like some amount of stars to keep going. Actually, this is just unrestricted. Or maybe you need to pay them money or something. I'm not sure yet. Either way, there is also an entrance to an overworld part right here. But you can't enter it yet. For that, you need to first beat Bowser. Then we get to part three. Part three is right here. This is a very beachy beach. There is going to be the Google Galleon here. And it is in fog. Whenever you try to walk here, it is just going to kick you back out and you fade out. You can't get there and you see like a silhouette of a ship in the fog. Yes, you can skip 4 and 5 just like in Mario 64. And on the speech side, you also find course 5. Course 5 is Wario Zoo. And Wario tells you he is going to sell you a ticket to the zoo. And the ticket costs however much coins you have in your inventory plus one. So you can never buy it. That's how it's going to work. And there is also the ice cap that you can unlock here. For the ice cap, you need to find a secret level entrance. It's going to be like a pirate treasure. Where it's like, oh, walk this palm and do three backflips and then do a ground pound. Something like that. With the ice cap, you can enter part four. Part four is right here. You walk here. You walk here. You can unlock the cloud cap in this part here with a cannon. You shoot into the clouds. And there is the lighthouse as well. With the lighthouse, you can rotate the lighthouse and shine the light at course 4's entrance. Which will make the ship you flew at become like a real ship and the fog will disappear. And now you can enter course 4. As well as there is a Monty Mole here that tells you he can get you a secret ticket. And he does it for like 100 coins or so to enter course 5. Yes, tea time. That changed. So that way you have two levels unlocked by going further in the overworld. Which I like. Then you can finally beat Bowser 1. And after you beat Bowser 1, you unlock basically the second part of the overworld. Which is part five. Part five is a jungle clearing here. I had something like this in mind here. But with more jungle around and less hills, more trees. You are going to be able to enter Dino Dino Land somewhere here. Dino Dino Land is going to be like a cave. Where if you walk into it. You kind of... I should know to start here somewhere. C6. You walk into it and the time kind of changes. Now you're in the past. The lighthouse will just change the lighting. Guys, don't get hung up on the course numbers. It doesn't matter. We can switch them around however we want. It doesn't matter. Anyway. There's also going to be a secret back entrance to course 2. In this jungle clearing path. As you can see, there's this old river down here. That goes into course 2. A super secret exit will be here. Where you can enter it and then enter the back side of course 2. There's no point to it. It's just a cool thing you can do. Other things you can see from here. You'll definitely see the volcano here. That you also see from part one. You'll see the lighthouse. You will not be able to enter here or anywhere else yet. Instead, what you can do is you can dive down into the lake. To enter part 6. Part 6 is an underwater cave system. Now in this underwater cave system. You find the entrance to the All Alone Bubble Dome. Which is unrestricted. You can get into it right away. You can swim back out. But also. There's a secret exit to part 1. So maybe you'll come out of a cliff. Like right here or something. And maybe there's a secret star. And there will also be a secret exit to part 3. Also maybe you can come out of a cliff here or something. And also get a star. Is what I'm thinking. Maybe only one of them gives you a star. Maybe the other one has something else. I'm not sure. As every part is a different loading zone. Next. Part 7. Part 7 is right here. This area here. This is another bay area. And here you can enter Koopa Wave Cove. Now to get to Koopa Wave Cove. You'll have to first rescue someone who's stuck. There's going to be a seal stuck on a sand bank here. You pull the seal out. The seal is like. Wow you're such a good guy. I was going to go to the star festival in Koopa Wave Cove. Do you want to come with me? Basically. And maybe there's an entrance to the side level here. For that I was thinking that if you are in Koopa Wave Cove. And you beat Star Free in Koopa Wave Cove. You unlock a manta ray in the overworld. That you can surf. And with the manta ray you can surf to the side level. That's the idea. Next. Part 8. Part 8 is this part here. So part 8. Is going to be destroyed castles. Destroyed castles are. You know how Mario destroys the castles in Mario World 2. Yoshi's Island. Where Yoshi destroys them. What's Dino Dino Land? You might be thinking. Dressing jungle. That is course 6. That's like a really old old jungle area. What does U4 stand for? Don't worry about it. That's the cap unlock stage number 4. In here. In the broken castles. First of all. How do you get there? This is the coolest part. You can't get there normally. Unless. You go into the underwater caves. And collapse some rubble here. That goes underground. And then this opens the path to get here. Which I think that's super cool. You need to unlock this overworld part first. In this part. The Koopa Carnival entrance can be found. To get to Koopa Carnival. There's going to be like a bump there. That's like wow. Only Bowser's most loyal minions. That got at least. I don't know. 35 stars. Are allowed to enter Bowser's theme park. So you need like 35 stars to get in. There's also going to be the bomb cap here. The bomb cap is a factory level. And there's going to be some climbing. To find like the hidden entrance into the factory. Next. Part 9. Part 9 is with the super happy tree. This is going to have a big super happy tree. And you find the wing cap level entrance here. Which okay. The wing cap level entrance is really cool to find. Basically right here where you forest. This is right above Koopa wave cove. And to get there. You will need to use the cloud cap. You've unlocked before. To like jump there. There's going to be like a huge entrance. With a huge amount of clouds here. And you jump into the clouds.  Bowser 2. Flying ship. There's a flying ship here. You just select the MS Yoshi or whatever. This is the ship we modeled for the Bowser 2 level. About like a year or two. You have to need so and so many stars to power it and then you can enter the second bowser level and make progress now before you enter the second bowser level there's going to be a blockage here and here and here meaning at this point before you beat bowser 2 your entire worldview is stuck to like this part you see that you can only go to this part this whole area here you can't explore it yet but after you beat bowser 2 you can finally go everywhere the way I'm thinking about this is that maybe there are super happy tree seedlings here that need to grow so you can cross here here and here and by freeing the Yoshis from bowser 2 you make the seedlings grow and now you can make progress again that's the idea now part 10 this one I'm not 100% sure about I was thinking this would be the mushroom plains or something and I'm not sure what to do with this mushroom plains is going to have the tree level that you're talking about called lofty lumber leaves which you can just jump on a gondola and you go up there there might have to be a multi-level hidden here somewhere and maybe there's another side level we can make with mushrooms somehow not sure exactly how that works next part 11 part 11 I think this you can just get there and this is oily boily bay to enter oily boily bay I'm thinking there's going to be an oil tanker and win some kind of boss fight and after you beat the boss entering the tanker just whoops you there to oily boily bay and I'm also thinking that if an oily boily bay you beat the boss fight then like there's like an oil spill here everywhere and after you beat the boss fight the side level opens up I think that works very well next we have in the volcano area finally this volcano that you've seen in the background the whole time you've been playing this you can finally get there and there's a train you can buy tickets to to enter course 12 I'm thinking there's going to be a side level with the rising lava somewhere if you jump into the volcano other than that I haven't had many ideas for the volcano area and then finally part 13 part 13 is this last area here it's going to have the craft level entrance which I'm thinking for the craft level entrance that's going to destroy Yoshi houses obviously from bosses minions and you can pay people to like rebuild the houses and one of the houses has the entrance to course 14 and that will get you there this is right this just sandy in the north mountains in the south that's what my notes say not really a hundred percent sold on that I'm not really sure that the theme for this overworld here is fitting at all so I might need to improvise something else and then there's two more parts in the clouds that I have not drawn in the first is just called clouds one if you get there and you can just get to the ice castle to get to clouds one there's the big Yoshi tummy bounce you need to like pay him buy him food and then he bounces you up and you can see the clouds too from here which the clouds too is above the volcano you get there and by jumping on a gazer there's gonna be a gazer here and it shoots a rock up and down and you need the bomb cap to destroy the rock and then you can jump on the gazer and it's just gonna put you to the sky in here you will find this space rocket that needs I don't know how many stars to get up into space and you will see the Bowser free level entrance I'm thinking I'm actually not 100% sure on the Bowser free level entrance because we have no idea what Bowser's third level is going to be and that's the full idea for the overworld so far lots of stuff happening now what else I want in this overworld I want 21 stars in the overworld I'm thinking five of those are secret levels six of those are special events a special event is for example right here after you get an X amount of stars a pirate raid is going to happen and like a bunch of pirates are going to infiltrate the island and have to beat them all to get a star and 10 secret stars is what I'm thinking so for the secret stars we have a few ideas like the exits from part 6 that I talked about earlier maybe Peach visiting the islands and you can meet her once you finally unlock part 13 and then you see her and she's like oh god it's Mario here's a star and other than that we are still pretty open we have six secret stars left and four events left that we need to add so what I like about this is how it's connected to this how oftentimes you like make progress in the overworld and do a thing and that makes something happen in an earlier part of the overworld I think that's how it should be I think the main part about this is that we have landmarks in future parts that you look forward to exploring that's like the most important principle we are going to listen to the OST today because it's so fitting with how this overworld works. That's like the one thing that was really good about Ocarina of Time I remember looking forward to Death Mountain for really long when I was a small little kid The B1 on the other side of the map will be in the volcano and it would make sense with the rising lava. You are correct that makes more sense we can just move that but considering course 1 and B1 already has rising lava maybe I don't want the rising lava side level well we'll see. How big will your game be? Ending this game will diminish big maps? and this will be multiple areas. Hello Zelda we are drawing the overworld. So yeah I think our number one concern is what is the third bowser level and number two is what other events we want to add. I was thinking Peggy Derm, the little elephant with the stop sign would be really cool to add to the overworld but I have been struggling to come up with a star for him what's Lure? Bowser could be rather like in Mario Galaxy. Yeah well we had course 1 be kind of like underground mines or Bowser 1 would be underground mines. Bowser 2 would be like skyships. I feel like to make the third Bowser level we need to make the story first and we haven't really done that. It's really just like Bowser steals the Yoshis and you have to rescue them but like why does he steal the Yoshis? The entrance with a long lineup? I'm not sure I understand. In the Bowser's castle Bowser wouldn't have a castle on Yoshi's Island there could be like a Yoshi outhouse and like a bunch of guys are in the line and he's like blocking the outhouse and they're all like I need to go but this guy is just standing there what an asshole. No we can't do that that's too weird. Slavery that's why. Yeah it's a little dark for a Mario game. You've been on the meeting Mario? No I got I got to the first coin in Castle Grounds and the very first coin was a money bag and it hit me. I just jumped into it and died Let's go Bowser castle first then we can make it flow. I think we need a story first and the quest is fully done then mmm like 99% and there's still the Biobak rework still so it's like yeah. You have a silly bully idea. Maybe they're probably a huge Bowser mech that you have to go inside. The first Bowser level has a boss fight Was that all the grudge from when Yoshi kicked his ass when he was a child? Yeah that's probably a good way of doing it. Like Funky Dime is blocking the way to the Super Heavy Tree and the Super Heavy is a big attraction place for NPCs to gather. Hmm so it's just standing around there and being like no one can look at this while I'm here. What if Panky Derm was just like blocking the entrance to someone's house and it's like I'm not letting anyone go in here and you ground pound him to destroy him. I think I like that I'm just gonna do that. Him just being a general nuisance is pretty funny. Please read down the plan while getting to the underwater course. Okay so in part 6 there is this jungle clearing with a lake in the middle and you just swim down in the lake which leads to an underwater cave system and somewhere in the entrance is just there. Ignore is bliss? Bowser can't find the oil from the land? Wait what? I have not. Let's see. Ignore is bliss. Oh ignorance is bliss. Oh well I hate to be a bummer. I brought you here to bring me comers. You know those people who buy power out of nothing. I mean Bowser being a ruthless capitalist just as like a story would be very funny. And that fits very well with the levels we already have. He has a theme park where there's no regulations at all. He has an oil rig where he works everyone to the bone. He enslaves the Yoshis. What's like the ultimate version of that? Now I think I want Bowser to be just a ruthless capitalist and that's the story of this. Yes it can Laureen. You can do whatever you want. Bowser creates his own world. We already have a Koopa carnival level though. Super battle building slash money bin. We need to make this work. He has a mine level. Then he has the floating ships. The floating ships are kind of automatic I think. I feel like. A yacht? Would he have a yacht? Is there anything here? If he had a yacht then we could just have this be in the background the whole time. It is soybeans. Regulations are feminine.  We're kind of... really the inspiration is more like for the story. So the first one he works the Yoshis to the death. That works. Now the Yoshis are free. But not all of them. Half of them are working on the spaceships. So you free them from the spaceships. Now what? What's your motivation to keep going after you freed all the Yoshis and Bowser too? It's not Iris we're thinking about right now. Turning Bowser into Elon Musk? No, no, no, no, no. Turning him into Elon Musk's boss. So all the Yoshis are basically robots and it's giving resources and time to all the good people of the Martian kingdom. Big Bowser-shaped cannon. What is even the story? The story is Bowser captures the Yoshis. Bowser makes the Yoshis work in his mines. You free the Yoshis in the mines. Bowser makes the Yoshis work in his flying ships and you free the Yoshis from there. So now after Bowser 2 we're in a space where all the Yoshis are free and Bowser is just kind of running around. But like how does it keep going now? Like why do you still go after Bowser is the question. You know what I mean? It's too random to imagine this. It needs to be like thematic with what we actually have. See Bowser was forcing the Yoshis to work for him the whole time so I think ideally Bowser now has this big evil thing that required a lot of work to build that you have to destroy. Hook them for a Yoshi on that. Oh I see what you mean. When you use Bowser's stones to impress Peach on snowfields that also kind of works. Bowser Bowser silicon can destroy the island if you kind of use it on him. That also kind of works. I think it needs to be related to the work the Yoshis have done. Or like if he still had the baby Yoshis and was falsely indoctrinating the baby Yoshis or something but that's like too complicated of a story. I don't I don't think so. Why would Bowser want to destroy the island though? I feel like that's not in character with him being a ruthless capitalist in this game. Do I even want that story? Are we making a woke type game right now? Is that even woke? I feel like that's not woke. I feel that's that's I don't know. Yes I know that that kind of works but at the same time I feel like that's still like a very complicated story. Yeah I think so too Dark Ways. That's also true at the same time but it still needs to somehow like it needs to be this happens and because of that this happens and because of that this happens not this happens and then this happens and then this happens. You know what I mean? I mean that would be really funny if like the Yoshis worked for him the whole time and then because of that Bowser finished his new invention called the Island Eater and then the whole time you play this game you see just a gigantic ship here with like a chainsaw at the front that's slowly approaching the island and it's like yeah I'm just gonna eat Dark Raiden, I don't know what that is, I was looking at all the power cells which I mean selling extortion prices oh yeah the events are going to be super fun once we actually implement those the island's a Yoshi circuit  what if we try to harvest a super happy tree or something like that but why would you need the Yoshis for that I wanna see Yoshi's apples well no we already have the thing where they do manual labor for him don't worry it's a no-zones system all the aluminum using a gigantic magnetic magnet but how does the Yoshis working for him play into this I think my initial idea was that the Yoshis were building a gigantic machine for him so him building the Island Eater would be fun and would kind of fit I think didn't Bowser also steal the super happy tree in Yoshi's Island why did Bowser steal the babies in Yoshi's Island wait what's the story of this game hammock attacks a stalker lowering baby brothers more and reaching he says he can't be able to move he's getting itchy in this room there okay all the ones that the brothers went back for salt that they would find his plans in the future I see so this is his plan in the future I guess why is he catching the Yoshi in the first place to make them work for him yeah super we roast the hub world hasn't been started yet we are completely remaking it basically I don't know about that I think it's a hey man I want a Mac and a pen now this is all too dark I think and it's like too random it doesn't build on what happened before I want to symbol on what happened before I think usually it's called I'm like I guess this is blood enough maybe I mean Yoshi built this new castle on the island yeah I mean they were building the what if they had built a castle and now you just have to enter the castle we could just do that we could just put a big bowser castle into part 13 or into the volcano oh but then like the question would be why didn't you see the bowser castle earlier from other parts I guess if we made it only visible from part 12 10 and inside part 13 that would be kind of working I could be thinking around this machine and go through signs with the machine all over the world yes yes yes that's the idea hello green weeble hot burrows I don't know what hot burrows is what if the machine that usually I'm building is designed to turn the super happy tree into the super depressed tree I see it's possible popular a big tank well that's what I was thinking a yacht earlier the art or however you pronounce it but then we also need to think about how you actually enter this level I like the idea of a cruise ship you have to infiltrate though that would just look so cool now we cannot have stats 11 it's a children's video game I like the yard idea too so the giant talent isn't big enough to have and it gets the more you progress it gets built yeah I agree that would be very cool too now they're not tea time I think the final fight should be like with one of those gigantic buildings inventions robots or whatever when I see that backyard I don't know it would be cool welcome by nothing David that's too complicated yes kamek can play a role in here I mean it could be the same spell Kamek uses on Bowser in Yoshi's Island where he gets really big and it looks like a gigantic fight on the sea we could have it be like the final from video mode but instead you're inside the building and you have to progress for each floor I don't remember how that works let's see what's that final level oh this is not it oh this I don't know this doesn't really feel like a fight I agree a giant bowser fight would look pretty cool what if it was a bowser cyborg mosey turned himself more and more into a machine that doesn't really work with you see uh the whole thing is a little weird with how you can see him on course 11 like gigabuzz from smash bros melee what the fuck okay wait what if I think about how to work this because you beat giga bowser in a game of backgammon oh yeah I would destroy him I think he'd suck backgammon and I'm decent at it okay but I'm thinking what could happen is Bowser builds something to harvest from the super happy tree and he uses an evil spell on it to turn into giga bowser and now you have to find giga bowser he would be harvesting the super happy tree's fruit here maybe this is a cutscene that happens after the second bowser level or when would this cutscene happen let me think about that so after the second bowser level he's just kind of defeated and talking about mario ruining his plans in course 11 at least that's what's going on right now we might have to adjust the course 11 text a little bit okay hello nintendo for life we might need to adjust this magic show too now that I think about it um if we go with this type of thing my boss is being ruthless he has to be goofy, he is goofy yeah, he is very goofy, but he still gets evil at the end, right? do you know what we can also do? maybe after um after the second bowser level he has the super happy tree and he eats the fruit and he becomes like gigantic and then your goal is to collect i don't know like 80 stars to make the fruit regrow and then you'll eat the fruit and you become giga mario and then it's a giga bowser versus giga mario fight and it's like half in water and you see the island like tiny next to you and it's like a hand-to-hand combat thank you for the bits tea time i did not hear what you said i only heard something about a gyat however that idea would mean that basically there's no third bowser level super satan super satan when eating a fruit from zubat you turn him into a really nice guy no it's like a rotten fruit or something i don't know something about this theory is it like that in bowser's theory that sucks but this is just it doesn't really work well with bowser doing the whole building a machine thing what if bowser just built a gigantic robot and it's like now bowser's gigantic robot is running rampage and then you need to run a super happy dream to become the size of the robot and it's hand-to-hand combat let's see there's your safari final boss oh my god he looks so sad poor guy he's wounded man it's just fucking smug face okay i think it needs to be a gigantic cyborg that he built i think it just has to be there's no other way i don't know what you 100 bit set t-time i'm sorry i don't really see any twitch messages come through except for the normal messages it's kind of silly well it would be with the super happy dream zelda that would be the idea donating to bowser for his own yacht oh i see i still like the idea of bowser's yard um since there's this oil clearing up an oily oily thing we can have bowser's yard here maybe let me let me note that down i think it's very fitting with us uh i just think it's a really cool idea so i'm definitely on board with it and then this is some part of um yeah look at it on fan game like dkrk and bunkers 64 what there is iris but this one would be like a much much bigger one i think a giant fight also just fits very well um but what i realize is that if we do we kind of don't have a third browser level don't worry about the tea time the cannons we wouldn't have a third browser level i guess that's fine though Yeah, I guess we just have to add another overworld secret star. I think that's the zoo. But would people feel disappointed by not having a third Basel level? Yeah, that wouldn't be enabled. That's very disappointing. That's a problem. But Basel could be in the yard. But what would be the third Basel level if the boss fight is a giant robot you build? Let's say he builds a giant robot and the giant robot is like running rampage here in part 13 and like attacking you if you come nearby. And then you get it by like collecting enough stars to open the super happy tree. How would that be a third Basel level? Oh my god. Okay, guys. I bought a gigantic platypus today and he just came by. He is so cool. I wish I could show you. He's like this big. I have a big, big fish in my tank. I like my giant platypus. Yo, thank you for the 19 months, Sonic. Yes, he's named Shenron. JP Morgan. Let's see. I've been looking at JP Morgan. Oh, he's a banker. But whenever he moves, he moves. He's stopping. Sorry, I'm distracting you guys. Is there a fight in the early-mid game and the end game? There's one in the early game, one in the mid game and then in the end game, right now, there's none. Which is kind of the issue. If we go with this idea anyway. But I don't worry that people will be disappointed that there being no third Basel level if it's just a boss fight. It's not gonna feel like there's a build-up to it, I feel. And space to make a zone, you have to go to space. I can press 15 to deactivate it.  I suppose if we could be climbing the robot. I suppose that it just randomly happened with the levels we made. He has a theme park in this game and an oil rig. Really, it was more of an accident than on purpose. Yeah, there has to be some sort of puzzle here, I agree. Scanning the missing source plot, I don't like that either. If we go with the robot idea, maybe there's something you have to do to make the robot vulnerable first or something. So we need to go there first. Incase it's not the metal, armor and weapon space stage from Sonic Adventure, it could be something like that. Or if the robot is like far in the ocean, he'd climb through like metal platforms and stuff like this to get to him. Maybe it was a bunch of like robots that he built. No Mittens, the level, the system I made is only working with one planet at the same time. This is a tough one. I do think the happy, the super happy tree should do something, because it's so important to the Yoshis. Well but that's a big part of the oil if we have it here. We could have it be so that there's one Bowser level you need to need to unlock the final Bowser fight and the final Bowser fight is the big giant Bowser robot that ravages the island. So, um... You're not sold on a giant, but there's something he needs to build though, right? I like Giga Bowser, he's cool. Giga Bowser's very cool. This looks extremely weird. If the issue grantees are interested with the Mega Grantee not being as cool as Undead Grantee or the first version of Grantee, I don't know what that is. Hello Beta Sigma Omega. Who's having a parasocial relationship here? Me?! Oh. I see. I was just trying to awaken some hidden power, Yoshi. Let me summon enough bad things to happen to the Yoshis. Eh? Okay, but the thing is, Senna, we need this to somehow build on the previous story of this. Goodbye, David. Have fun with Latek. We could make it so that the reason he even built the skyscrapers is to get up to the Super Happy Tree and to harvest the fruit. And then... After you beat him, he's like, how about that? Hmm. Doesn't work with Course 11 being a normal Bowser, you know. Hmm. We got this other Bowser. I mean, both Mario and Bowser being giant and slow would be like, great for a fight. Because when you make them slow, you have a much easier time having, like, fist-to-fist combat. Hmm.  Hmm. And also being in Course 11 is kind of limiting us. Maybe he shouldn't be there. He needs to be there for Course 11 to work. Fuck. We put ourselves in a bit of a corner. Maybe with Kamek? I mean, that also kind of works. But eh. We all have the issue with Course 11. Really, what we need is the motivation from Mario to keep going after the second Bowser level. We could just say, okay, well, there's more Yoshis to free. And they're working somewhere else for Bowser. And then that's the last level you have to enter. And yeah, Kamek should appear at some point. Kamek should probably be some of the end events. Let me write that down here. Hmm.  Kamek and Kamek are trying to stop you too. We can put some story in those two. I'm trying to remember the name of this. Hmm. I don't want to make the story progression depending on any course, but that's something we just can't do. The point of Mario 64 is that you're free to go wherever. This has already been an issue in Mario Sunshine. Hmm. Hmm. What we could also do is, um. The giant Bowser mech appears here. And that's the Bowser level. You have to go inside the mech and destroy the mech. And then after you beat him, or after you destroy the mech. That's when the boss fight happens. And the boss fight is with Giga Bowser. It's like, well, destroy the mech, but it doesn't matter. We managed to get this happy fruit. And now I'm Giga Bowser and can destroy you. Something like that. But then the question is, how does Mario get big? I guess all the Yoshis could have just been like, secretly harvesting the fruit for you. And like, well, we got a super happy fruit for you too, Mario. We figured this would come in handy. And then it's Giga Bowser versus Giga Mario. I think that's a really cool ending. I'm not sure I understand the issues. Well, I mean, you know, you're saying you don't understand the issue. The issue is, if Bowser is giant after the second Bowser fight, then him being normal in Crusader makes no sense. I think we'll do that. Then the question is, okay, what do you need to actually enter the fight with the mech? I think the visual of the mech being here in part 13 and like actively destroying the island is super cool. But we ran Bowser from taking the super happy tree until the end of the game, some sort of magic. He needs his big mech for that. Big mech is big enough to like, grab the tree and take the fruit for him. Yes, this is what I'm suggesting, T-Time. I think I like that. So the boss fight, the Bowser 3 level would be, you climb through Bowser's mech to destroy it from the inside. And then you fight Giga Bowser. No, no, that doesn't work. Now we just need to get this off with the player having enough stars. I'm thinking you need 80 stars to enter the Bowser level here. I think that's a good amount. Let me get something more creative, some robot Bowser. Like, what? Yeah, exactly, Dark Waze. So you destroy one giant fake Bowser and a giant real Bowser appears. It's also going to be epic-looking, which is perfect for a finale. It's going to be epic-looking, which is perfect for a finale. A robot shark? Now it's going to be unprotected, because all the Yoshi's are captured. Now it's going to be unprotected, because all the Yoshi's are captured. The normal mech has been done a thousand times. It should, but it's like super fitting here. I mean, the game already does it once, right? It could be a Giga Bowser-shaped mech or something. I don't know. Keep in mind, most of the level would be inside of him, rather than outside. So in that regard, we have a lot of playroom. We have a lot of moving platforms we can make, or moving rooms even. And I think that's going to be very, very cool. Bowser shell tank mech? It could be like a tank, almost. How about a turtle? That's so cringe. Oh yeah, Mario Sunshine did this too. Five Mario games? Minecraft did this? I don't know. We had a Cyprus Bowser mech. I think I'm fine with a normal Bowser mech. Just a big guy. I mean, he can have special weapons, right? He can be very stylized. He can have flamethrowers, like Blastoise. I don't know. Let me just... Oh shit, Biobak. I can tell you the whole story in a little bit of what's going on. The overworld is crazy, and I'm very happy with it, actually. So far. Right now, we're just thinking about the final Bowser level. To give you the TLDR. So, this overworld has 15 parts. And part 13 of the overworld, after you beat the second Bowser level, has a giant mech Bowser around the coastline. And I can't write. The giant mecha Bowser is going to be here, and he's going to be rampaging. And we need some way that you can enter mecha Bowser to destroy him from the inside. And after you destroy mecha Bowser from the inside, Bowser eats the Super Happy Fruit and turns into Giga Bowser. And you have to fight him with Giga Mario. In fist-to-fist combat. I just need a bullshit reason for why you can't instantly enter it. Penguin Plane? Penguin Plane is pretty cool. But I wouldn't like that you need to be like star 3 of the 5th course to enter the final boss. I think that's a little not great. I want the player to enter any course they want. Ruin Cannon? Surfing away to mecha? Okay, but why is it locked behind getting like 80 stars? This is so simple GTM, do you not understand this? Okay, to give you a rundown of the principles behind the overworld. The overworld is 13 parts. I want the player to be able to explore every inch of Yoshi's Island. You get a full 360 view of this. Future parts of future overworlds that you can't see yet are going to be visible from earlier parts of the overworld. You're going to have to make progress in the overworld to unlock stuff that happens early in the overworld. And we have a few mechanics where you need to be star 4 of course 7 to have this thing happen in the overworld. And then you can find a secret star or a secret level. On top of that I want events to happen in the overworld. So for example in this bay here pirates can attack. And you get a star from that. And that happens on some random star counts. And I think I want 6 to 10 events and I also want 6 to 10 secret stars in the overworld. So yeah, that's basically the idea. She does not claim any. I think it will be very cool. I'm really enthusiastic about the overworld. Sci-fi star barrier. I can send you the full overworld plan if you want. If you want to read through it. It's extremely complicated. But you might have some really good ideas for it. An animation where you have to do a race. Yes! I like the speed gamers special house GTM. Yes, there are 44 Yoshi challenges Iris. Alright, I'll send you the plan after the stream then. Ummm. Still the question is how do you enter the final boss level. That's really the last question until we are free to get going in the overworld. Has he no pillars? Except the stars. Restructure the revelation. Okay, what's the revelation? The idea for quest 15 entry is just a star powered rocket. I know it's lame. But what else are we going to do? The robot was abandoned. Well, we need something for the last boss level. In case you need to hear from Biobak not in the Mecha Bowser. If anyone has a better idea for how the last boss level should work. Let me hear it. Wait, it didn't show. Shit! Biobak, I think your message got eaten by restream. Because I don't see it. And someone just thanked you. Does this happen a lot? Ummm. If you shut up, we will have expensive items. So we need a way for players to rent. Money? Gambling? Wait, what? Hello, SmokeScreamTV. Is that your revelation? Hey, what turned into Giga Bowser GTM? No, the final boss would be Giga Bowser Biobak. He would be eating from the super happy tree. And then he would turn into Giga Bowser. See, ok, the way we got to this is basically. This whole time Bowser has been ruled as capitalist. If you think about it. His first level or his first action is enslaving people. His second action is opening doors.       Opening a theme park. Where he violates every regulation. His third action is having an oil rig. His fourth action is. He makes the Yoshi's work on a space flying ship. And then I'm thinking. What else would fit? Well, maybe if he wanted to harvest the island's resources. It would fit. And that would be the super happy tree. So maybe his goal all along was to build his mech. So he could harvest from the super happy tree. He needs like a giant thing for that. It's like, ok, well. Now he has the super happy tree harvested. And maybe that turns him into Giga Bowser. That was my idea. I'm thinking he needs to have built something with the Yoshi's. There needs to have been like. Some purpose behind his actions this whole time. And I get that. Us thinking about this in post is maybe not ideal. But what else are we gonna do? Yeah, so the super happy tree would be here. Right here. And it would be pretty much visible from everywhere. The mech. Ok, so the Bowser mech would not be an enemy. It would be a level. He would go inside and strike from the inside. And that's like the level. And then. After that. You can fight the final boss. I don't know. I don't know. I think you can eat the hard fruit. And become invincible in Yoshi's story. That's all that happens I guess. You can make the mech or Giga Bowser. Well. Yeah, but I'm having trouble coming up with anything else. That also works. GTM. Maybe he thrives on people being. Upset. You don't have to beat Giga Bowser. That would be the end of the story. It's very similar to the first boss claim. And unfortunately. I was quite sick for a bit. But I should be good now. A time machine. I like the idea of him building a time machine. Thinking about it. Hmm. Hmm. So he did build a time machine. And you go back. And then maybe you're in a prehistoric version. Of this. And there's a bunch of Yoshis that. What was the idea here? You can save Mario in Mario World 2. So you have to save baby Mario again. Hmm. There being any end game content. Or even something smaller. Like maybe unlockable skins or something. Probably King Chepper. Maybe unlockable Luigi or something. Okay. But you know how we have the prehistoric Yoshis. That look like more brutal Yoshis. What if he went into the time machine. To get a bunch of prehistoric Bowser's. And you have to fight his whole family tree. Hmm. Adult Koopalings. Oh god I hate the Koopalings. I don't want to see them ever. The Koopalings destroyed Mario Kart 8 for me. It's like oh my god I unlocked something. Oh it's fucking Larry Koopa. Brother if I unlock one more Koopaling. I'm gonna lose it. Oh what it's Wendy Koopa. Oh my god I'm so glad. Maybe Pink Metal Princess Peach. You know what. Maybe the Koopalings weren't the problem. I don't know about that Biobak. That seems a little weird. It would have to be like progressively stronger versions of Bowser. Bowser Quest 3 being the time machine itself. Has a lot of potential. Yeah. Hmm. Just thinking. What would be the best way to make a time machine work. This is your brain on drugs. Yes. This is the third overworld. We're thinking about how to finish the story. And how to make the third Bowser world work. Hmm. Oh yeah. That would be the thing the Yoshis worked on. The bonus control. Hmm.  Yeah that's Internet Explorer. Maybe exploring the Internet. And a dried Zika. Yes that's what it is. Dried Zika. Would it be a fun idea though to fight multiple bowsers at the same time? I don't know. Maybe it'd be just like an ancient version of bowser. Just like one really old version of bowser. Yeah I don't like multiple bowsers either. Only if it was like one bowser. I mean if you go back like a million years in the past and you find like a dinosaur like bowser that's like way bigger and he has like bigger horns and everything I think that would be kind of cool but then it's kind of awkward with the other bowser just standing in the background being like well go fight him daddy. Fight him grandpa or grand grand grand grand grand grand grand grandpa. Or maybe he would use the time machine to go into the future and that's like a very futuristic bowser like I don't know how would that look like like a paradox form bowser. He's definitely make the time travel gimmick interesting. Yeah. Past, current, and future bowsers separate but make a mega final boss. Hmm. Wouldn't it be a good idea if the final boss was just built on the beach and that you need 80 stars to power it and then when you walk into it it's like yeah you walked on my trap you activated my thing. I don't know about that but it is possible. This to you as a reference. Mario's time machine oh god. Mario is going to independence hall and then fighting an ancient knight. I don't think this is a good inspiration. Yeah it would have to be something like that if that's what we're going with. 80 is very 50 and it's 180 isn't it maybe I mean it could be 100. I'm not 100% sure not yet. I like the visual of mecha bowser rampaging a lot though. Such a cool thing. Because we already have a mech in the first boss fight and because it's kind of like a done idea already. We have to fight mario bowser to go off the time machine as bowser and mario bowser are on yoshi's island one. And then what's the fight? Yoshi managed to get on the beach so we need 80 stars for this mission to get everyone on the island to protect us from bowser. It just doesn't return there and then she turns into kamek like hey you fell right into my trap these are all bowser's needs to polish my machine and he steals the stars from you. Yeah yeah. Ah but that's like. I feel like there isn't any urgency for the player to act up in something like that. It doesn't feel like you know the the stakes are higher and like when you need to hurry up and like things are going worse and worse and only mario can save the day. If it's something like that it's like oh we're already safe but now we're gonna be safer if you do this. This doesn't work in an open world game. What do you mean? It's not really open world right? It's like you first start with just this section here and you beat the first bowser level which opens up like this section of the overworld and then this third section here is closed until the end and that's what you unlock after the second bowser fight. Does the player be free to do anything and have any sense of urgency? I think there's a little bit of a sense of urgency with the yoshis being stolen and enslaved and you having to save them from bowser 1. I think that works. In mario 64 you definitely feel like you have made progress. Yeah I want some amount of the player feeling like there's stakes to what they're doing. I have GTM. Hey Mr. Sticks, if the mario's iframe is the same as the mario's iframe add it to 2 flames. 3 flames for mario's eyes blank and other characters are bowser's eyes. More I don't like his eyes and blanking 3 flames. Can edit? Yes you can edit that. Super sad trick to become a mecha spiritual galaxy being. I don't know man. The super sad trick is pretty good. If I can submit giant bowser and kamikaze yoshi on one but with the exception of yoshi maybe. Riding the same yoshi that you do in yoshi's island during the final boss fight would be pretty cool. But that's like it's throwing out everything you've practiced the whole time and just giving you something else. And this makes a pretty good because it's already leveled him up. We can't do huge bowser because it's galaxy. You can't do huge mario and bowser because it's bowser everything's been done. I see what you mean. But huge bowser has been done like a million times. I don't think it's that bad if we do it one more time. But yeah I get why that would not be that interesting. But I mean I guess that's kind of why I like giga bowser because like it is big bowser but it's also like cool bowser and he has like different attacks. So if you go back in time yeah it kind of works.  what if bowser has just been using the time machine to get his ancestors out and after the second bowser level a bunch of other fights start to appear. It's like mini fights you have to do. But like simple and small fights maybe they give you like a star or two and then there is a last level where you have to fight bowser where he really really goes back in time and it's like a million year old bowser who's like a gigantic dinosaur looking thing and it's the boss fight. So that way we still have some amount of urgency because it's like bowsers are invading the islands like bowser is dropping off his bowsers like everywhere. And then b1 box art. I don't see bowser here. This? I don't really have a bowser level then though. So the idea of the yoshis having builders for this also kind of works though. I'm not against that. So hello maui. We're pretty stuck finishing the story. We need something that bowser has forced the yoshis to build and I think a time machine is great but then the question is how do we make a boss fight out of the time machine? How do we make a bowser free level out of the time machine?  this one is so lame. This one's okay. This one's so lame. This one's so lame. This one's so lame. That's kind of okay. Why do I hate them? The island in different directions. So you have to get to the world at different points in time. That's the bowser level. Hmm. Yeah we thought of that before. Rookie. Why would you want to blow up the island? I mean a mobile castle isn't so bad. I like the idea of him using the time machine to bring back slightly weird versions of bowser into the overworld and maybe they speak old timey. Maybe like a bowser and lightning armor and that's like a fight. You know what I mean? And then the final boss is like well how can you do against my strongest ancestors? So and the whole thing could just be on bowser's floating island. Like that could just be a part of it. Just could just so happen to be. So Do we really need the time machine plot or like? I mean the time machine plot feels like it's coming out of nowhere. Hmm. How do we explain that to the layout? Like oh let me build a time machine too. Oh there's right way on cmd. I think this entry is a pretty simple idea. But it also doesn't really get us anywhere. You may need to decide on the time machine in the first place. I didn't decide on it. It was just suggested by Biobak. And let me try to make it work with the story somehow. I don't care if people make that joke. Why is it gonna be so tough? So Yeah that's that's where the island eta happens you know. Where it's like he forced the yoshis to build a giant machine. That he calls the island eta. And it's just gonna be approaching the island. And like it's trying to farm the super happy tree. And they got none on the island. Because both are trying to steal the heart of the girls protected by the roots of the super happy tree. Oh so he built a giant drill this whole time. That that kind of works yeah. So he built a giant drill. And I guess you can see the giant drill like drilling in the background. And I guess the entrance would be under part six. Part six is the underwater caves. It works again. He just wants others to not feel happy. I don't know. I don't like that. I like both are just trying to steal all the natural resources. That's rain cats. Oh that could be. It's gone. There's no rendered up to it. Or well it's a render order thing right. Because it's like transparent. I have no idea my clock. So let's say we go with the drill. Still don't see how this works out. Control to a massive Yoshi. He wants to control like a dragon. We already have a massive Yoshi, so I don't want to do even more of that. This one would probably be placed around here. Yeah, the Yoshis have been powering Bowser's inventions before. They're still shaped like an egg. And you would go like underground to find it. Maybe... Yeah, that would work really well. We could just have it be like in part 6. This part here, which is underground. And then we'll just go there. And... How do you enter it? Maybe after the second Bowser level it opens somehow? What's the way to enter it? What's the way to fight it? I think the story idea works. What do you mean it's Course 2 material? There's already an underground cave. If the underground cave had a huge cloud of the island thing somewhere, that wouldn't be so weird. Would this be reusing level themes? I guess kinda. I have no idea, I'm pretty sure Twitch is doing this automatically. I turned them to the absolute minimum they can be. Yeah, just because it's underground, I don't think it's necessarily going to be like other levels. There's a lot of underground levels in Yoshi's Island that we can use inspiration from. It's still like what do you do against the drill? It's still a question. No, if chat doesn't have any ideas, then chat isn't going to have any ideas either, right, Seiko? Follow my crystal caves? We can look at it, but I mean, we don't want crystal caves. Yeah. I mean, the color palette is nice. I do kinda like that. What if it's like this? It reminds me a lot of Bowser once level here. Alright, bye Zeina. Hmm. Whose idea was it to add these things that make coins appear? I hate that idea. That is so annoying. My question with the drill is more like how do we turn the drill into something that unlocks at some amount of stars? Star turns gas? Why would we power Bowser's invention for him? You wouldn't? Okay, then this makes no sense, does it? Come and near it? For Bowser? Into the super happy tree? I don't think so. Is there a way to pass time? That's, no, that doesn't feel right either. It's just an entry point. You reach the end of the level and Bowser's already there. Steals the heart and powers his time machine or whatever. Maybe also the orange tree makes sense because Bowser will be due to it. Okay, but why do you need some amount of stars to enter the third Bowser level? Because we don't want the player to be able to get there right away. And I don't want this to just be something that happens untelegraphed in the background. I want the player to have in mind like, okay, I need 80 stars to get here. And so I'm gonna collect 80 stars to get there. I don't want them to be like, okay, well, I got one more star. Let's go back and see if I can do something here. Oh, I guess not. Let's get one more. You know what I mean? I don't think that would be a fun experience. Mechanic thing. I don't like the mechanic thing. I want the player to use the stars to power something. Like very purposefully to prevent Bowser from doing something. Bowser looked down and went in and sealed the entrance with a magic barrier. I think that I'm a lot more fun with that. So how would this look like? Would this be a giant hole in Yoshi's Island? Like let's say we just have a giant hole around here. And then me panicking Yoshi's all around. I mean like Bowser drilled into here and now he put the magic barrier. And when you go back to part seven, you see the hole there. And maybe Bowser's minions are stationed all around the drill hole. I think that works. Then the question is, what is the boss fight after all that? I think we have something that works though.  Bowser said it's the heart of the train, which gives him powers or something. Okay, so right at the end, Bowser already has it. And then it's a fight against Bowser and he has special powers. Yeah. Then we need to think about what the special powers are. Because the first boss fight is super cool with the Meg. The second boss fight is kind of cool with the Flying Island. What's the third boss fight? Just a fist fight with Bowser? Or do I finally get my Giga Bowser fight here? The giant Bowser that we fight with the big evil horns. I am dead for 1.96. You might not see it on screen right now because we're planning a lot of stuff. But like... We're making a whole game attached to this. I made all this. And this too. Isn't that cool? That's true, we would want the island Yoshis to help during the fight. Yes. Okay. What am I thinking about? Oh wow, this shadow is really bad. That is funny, Biobak. I'm looking forward to seeing this nasty area. I'm not sure this is much nicer looking than TTA. TTA has a much simpler style, but I feel like the colors work better together. This is just more work and more effort, I think. Less skill put together, I'm going to be honest. Something's really wrong with the grass here. Okay, remember Bowser? He has the root of the island or the heart of the island. He gets all the power from the super happy tree. He's like, why was I so young when I was stupid? Why was I so stupid when I was young? I didn't need the super happy tree at all. What I really needed is the heart of the island. This is where all the power is from. That makes him strong. Maybe the lesson in the end is that happiness doesn't come from eating the super happy tree food. It comes from being with your friends and having a good time. Maybe not. The grass is cool. Hello, Aeza. We're currently thinking about the final boss fight. A little difficult. Okay, that one coin was not solid. Interesting. I have not done that Mario, but I'm not opposed to doing that. It's very easy to do. That's a good thing, Sour. And that crash is a bad thing. Well, the fight would be underground. Around the root. Bowser would probably be in a hole somehow. Or maybe with his new fight he can send you to the bizarre dimension. Hello, Sonic the Hedgehog. What if Bowser sends Mario to the bizarre dimension? We can do whatever we want now. We can have a bunch of scenery switches. I mean, yeah, with Bowser's new fights he can just send you to an arena. He can send you to wherever you want. He has the super happy heart of the tree, right? He can do whatever he wants. We can give him any bullshit power we want. We can make it work in multiple locations as well, yes. Okay. We can do a new denizen. The arenas should be made up of different possible stages. The tree has powers. It doesn't make sense that the Yoshi's don't have powers. It doesn't mean that the Yoshi's are eating the heart of the island. He can do anything. Or are you saying you want Bowser to have a long tongue and lay eggs? Yoshi Bowser? Yoshi Bowser would be pretty cool. He could be a more Yoshi-shaped Bowser. What would he do? Lick you and then spit you back out? Maybe, okay, what if there's Yoshi's walking into the arena? You can jump on them and ride them. But if you don't do it in time, Bowser eats them, turns them into an egg and throws the egg at you. And the egg explodes into fire. I think, I mean it would be very cool if they were a Biobak, I agree. Why would people suggest the enchanted GPT, that's crazy to me. Why would an enchanted GPT have any idea on this? You're not the first one to do that, Aeza. He wouldn't be giant. Alright, no mechanics in the fight, that's not a good idea, we need to introduce it earlier. Like Yoshi riding, yeah. But well, he could be eating his own minions, right? He could be eating his own minions and throwing burning eggs at you. Oh, the grass crimp was great. Okay, so we got Yoshi Bowser, next with the super happy tree fruit. The location though, the location of the fight just being underground, under the roots of the super happy tree, don't we like that? I guess it's kind of fine, but it's not great. Makes everything very sad, how would that look like? You mean like the location would be very sad looking? MD Davis, I can barely understand what you're asking all the time, you need to say things in a way that it comprehends them more, unfortunately. Green day unerupts and a stream of lava suspends the arena and the sky above the island. Oh, like, because he destroys this and the island now just fucking implodes and lava spits out and now you're fighting high up in the sky on a lava platform. It kind of works. But thinking about how that would look is crazy, it's looking a little weird if we do that. But that's the plot of JoJo part 2, kinda, yeah. We could also just have Bowser turn into this Yoshi Bowser and then he flutter jumps away and you can't follow him and that's like the after Bowser level and from there on you just go back to the overworld and the fight happens there or something. I don't think real Mario loves sorrow, let's see. I don't think I'm on the right video, I don't get it either, hello Madonna. Oh it definitely needs to rain, yes yes yes for sure, it needs to rain and it needs to be welted. And I think it should be where the super happy tree used to be, so the fight should be right here. Okay the cutscene is, the heart of the super happy tree is right there, Bowser touches it and absorbs it, it transforms into Yoshi Bowser, the roots start to wilt, rain starts to fall, the cave fills up with rain and you get washed up or something. And you end up right here with everything here now changed to look super wilted looking and you have to fight Bowser, like right next to the super happy tree. I think that works. And Bowser is just Bowser but with Yoshi abilities, he can use his tongue, he can shoot axe at you, he ground pounds you. No fancy cutscene needed, so you get to the end of the level and why would Bowser run away now? I don't know if I like that, that he would run away. I think it's easier if he just jumps through the ceiling and then rain fills it up. I think we'll do that. Let me just write that down. Um, Bowser's drill hole, alright so Bowser has that drill hole in overworld 13, um that's the drill hole in his form of constructing stuff for his enemies and you end up right here, you are in world 6, you have the roots of the super happy tree, Bowser's drills are in the holy islands, he transforms into Yoshi Bowser, I don't know if it's the island or because he's got what he wants so he can fuck off, no need to fight Mario. Yeah, yeah, I think this works, I don't think the cutscene is going to be a lot of work, I think we're fine. Um, afterwards, the roots went into the rainstorms, Bowser jumps out of the cave leaving a hole at the top, the cave freaking fills with water and um, the rainstorms stop and he's out on the park, the land of the overworld, you might think there's a super happy tree and if you notice, Mario takes the fight with Bowser, or Yoshi Bowser starts. I think that's all, I think this works fine, I think this is a cool final boss fight and this works story-wise now. Hey say case, what if N64 logo look like Zelda N64 if he can add to his fan game or make a I'm not interested in adding a Zelda or N64 logo to this game. Maybe Maglock, but let's think about Bowser fight mechanics. So, can turn Mario into him, can eat some of his own moon rings and then shoot the eggs that explode in the flames, and ground-punch on him. How do you damage him? How do you damage Yoshi? Yeah, he will be slightly bigger. I should probably write that down here. Hmm. Kicking them back, kicking them back is kind of lame. I'm not sure about the exact size relation here, yet. Could make him eat spicy food like Mario Sunshine. Oh god, I definitely need to import the Mario 64, Mario Kart 64 sounds for this. Import N64 sounds for Bowser, that's so fitting.  make him eat spiky stuff or spicy stuff was probably the easiest way to do this. Making him ground-punch stuff that will hurt him. Wouldn't it be nicer though if the Yoshis help you somehow? I just feel like an epic finale. The super sad ring grows broken hearts and you have to feed them to him. Oh yeah, I like the idea of the super happy tree helping you fight back. So when he thanks you, you just throw the stuff forward. Maybe Bowser is just allergic to happiness, so they still grow happy fruits and they make Bowser I don't know, puke. I'm depressed. Imagine, okay, imagine it turns into the super sad tree and you feed Bowser like a fruit and then Bowser says some shit like I'm so worthless. Wait, did I even try? There's no way I would ever win against Mario and he's just like sad and like falls over and you ground-punch the snoot. So yeah, let's try that. Super happy tree, that's Mario, super sad tree, feed him a set of fruits to get a temporary depression during which he falls over and is in a coma or something. Okay, this thing needs to ramp up in intensity. I guess after some amount of hits Bowser would become angry or something. Um the thing needs to kind of some how become angry and start touching mario over his onion. I like doing the comeback to the 64 style where you grab his tail maybe it's like harder to spin um and he runs into a wall here and also gets a sponge and you can grab and throw him? Maybe? You can grab his tail and beat him. There's still a question mark like I don't see how that would actually do anything. I mean it's looking good for the fight though I think this fight will work out no problem. Oh my god So well it will be super rainy No it's not going to collapse I don't think Wow Lava shooting out of the ground I like lava shooting out of the ground here maybe when he gets angry um and then maybe you just have to throw him into the lava um I don't know maybe you just repeat that three times um it's a short plotline but I think it works I have no complaints about this Hello Woofoo. Here's in the happy tree drop the pepperonis. Yeah that that was an idea too for a second but I think it being a super sad tree now and giving Bowser depression is infinitely more funny. The last fight before B3 is also Yoshi. You don't have to do courses on order but I mean also Yoshi is kind of far-fetched when it's Bowser I think with this I'm fine and I think this finishes our overworld and story pretty well and from my side I'm feeling pretty done with this and it's also almost five so I think it is about time I finish my stream so I will be seeing you guys in the next stream which probably happens on Tuesday or Saturday I'm not sure about Tuesday doing this overworld is extremely mentally exhausting and I might not be able to do it on Tuesday so I'll see you then bye
