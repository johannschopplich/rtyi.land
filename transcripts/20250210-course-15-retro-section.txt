Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? You name them the same they are going to export in order from fast64 and you get cache coherent codes you could stream each segment separately and that's in fact what i did with all my binary hacks but it's not that simple in decomp because decomp.exe  if you guys want to see a secret hack i've been cooking up this is something i've been working on off stream this is a paid commission but it is very funny oh you can just make a script for that violin i think that's probably what i should be doing so this is this is drug mario you can like buy guns from him let's see i'm gonna buy a bunch of buildzuka ammo and which city should we go to los angeles boston miami new york city toronto atlanta springfield detroit or chicago let's go to atlanta yes we did work on this biotech made like most of the levels here it's a long time ago until you like it too much trumpet but not enough skin flute on flash fm yeah we have a radio in here the second unabandoned is the guy that paid me to make this take me again so now we have three stars one day i gotta find the pink panther to buy drugs from him oh look at that that's a gang of weegees there we go there's the pink panther just making sure i'm safe here one because again the bottle just just fucking killed me yeah and there's the quota you have to meet and there's news too police investigations oh i need health packs i think i need some armor pieces too so the point of this game is to like buy and sell drugs and like kill people to make like a million dollars right now i have five dollars and uh as you go you can buy upgrades to it for like your weapons so like running shoes and hosey it's like always five random ones i think this is going to be a pretty fun game once it's done it's almost done too so and if they're using the emulator that doesn't exist i mean there's no other option there's parallel launcher but like it's just worse than nemia so why would i ever use parallel launcher so i didn't mean to end on this level um it will probably run on console but it will not run very well what the fuck what in tarnation let's try that one again hello decar we need a background for the r64 section as well so clouds  bass i'm very happy with nemu though and i'm also happy with project 64 1.6 literally the only emulator i don't like is parallel launcher i think the dev of parallel launcher himself like just hates me or something because every time i make a hack he patches parallel launcher so it can't run the hack anymore or like he removes all the downloads of my head off his website i don't know what's going on there yeah that's quite a nice shirt for some reason so i agree yeah we're gonna have to keep the vanilla shitty aesthetic have fun with that i'm trying to make it slightly better than vanilla like i have look at this i have to path uv maps like i think we're allowed to fix the uv mapping right deep fried cheese is this a song request it's a song request what's going on just the uv mapping what about just just a little bit of like of like uh vertex colors just a little bit as a treat oh yeah obs is garbage sometimes it just kills my mouse cursor no vertex colors no what about vertex colors only to emulate vape lighting nothing else  so this is gonna be full of water we're gonna have some chicken boxes here go over here oh he's some snowman here then over here there's going to be like a merry-go-round to jump off of and then there's going to be two merry-go-rounds here okay yeah the fog looks decent i don't like it so far i think it's fine i'll provide you why i don't think there's much you can do unfortunately there aren't many simple tasks on the game uh i'm allowed to fix the uv maps right i shouldn't be i also fixed this uv map yet this was a disaster before an empty void space when you're ready to rebuild the stage patterns and shit like they float around okay i can show you so okay this is this is good for stream actually i need some input on this so in this romhack you shoot people and everything but there's one level called chess which is kind of like a political thing and all koopas are bastards i have a special treat for you i'm telling you this one's on compactus like this right so there's like five flags like this and you're killing people in here and people were saying they don't like this they feel like this is offensive towards the lgbt community and um for that reason i think i want to censor this level here a little bit of course this is not meant in like an edgy offensive way so i'm thinking everything is going to be replaced with just like bowser flags and like all koopas are bastards stickers and stuff like that i think that's the solution here because if we all perceive it to be offensive then that's bad obviously you're doing that that's good so we make this more like an anti-bowser protest than whatever else this is supposed to be like fuck koopas is good all koopas are bastards this is glorious yeah exactly mayamek i didn't think you meant this to be offensive you don't strike me as an edgelord i didn't think it was offensive either when i first saw it but obviously people were offended by it that's not even supposed to be it's a city look at the difference how did you have to send mines by like what am i doing so differently yeah decoy i'm saying something about melting the breeze are you thinking like smaller sections of the levels more like just like cat parts  you can't just put mario 64 lines in this you actually have to fix them too so part of that was filling a space but you know whole sections like this a lot more split in your head i see i see we can split this a lot more i mean i think that's a valuable idea splitting this a lot more also lets us add a little bit more difficulty to this so you're thinking like maybe this platform here would be cut or something is that kind of what you're saying oh i wasn't planning for the volcano to have walls this is just what the volcano looks like before i added it all of this is just unedited levels here i only had it until here um but like i said my main concern right now is also that it's like too many what do you think of this section is this how you imagined this what if i split this more so oh god you're getting the source when i pronounce this i like it being a little more split like so maybe so i want there to be plenty of skips in this too i think that's going to be essential to making this fun so maybe like so okay let's try to split these things a little more then because i agree actually that would be better have it feel a little more fragmented maybe split it like here maybe splitting it also would help me make this a little which is absolutely what i want so if it doesn't go over itself it's going to be bigger than the area can be so this white box here is kind of the maximum we should go otherwise we're gonna have render issues oh yeah but i don't think that's an issue do you want to just make this whole section by yourself i'm fine with that honestly i can just say fuck it buy a background or whatever he wants i think there isn't much to do here other than like feasibility because it sounds like you have a very cool idea in mind that's very different from this i can give you the notes on this i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to do it and i don't like the level snippets i had if you want i can just put this aside and then put the levels again i just think i was only able to add them there no not a hundred percent but i think oh we could do the only app 64 thing where there's like chunks and then we can make the level long like that but it's not gonna yeah no i don't think that's a good idea we need like multiple areas for this let's see how much ram we even have didn't need to open this thing trust me and we will escape from the city all right i'll just do a basic thing and then let you split it up a little bit to make it more difficult and stuff that sounds good to me  i'll just finish this section here then being split Wait, they put this song in the Pupil Olympics? That's crazy. Okay, well, no need to perfectly remember them either, because it's gonna change anyway. Enemies in these objects? We can absolutely put Goombas and stuff and some enemies from the levels, but I don't think all of them. Oh no, I think we're getting visitors. Is this enough of stuff? What is this? Are we already this far in memory? Oh, we're using a lot of memory. We have not much space left, maybe like a quarter of a megabyte. This retro pipe theme is the N64 era? Yes, the last retro pipe is literally just Mario 64. So what do we take from the volcano? Why is this a small section here? It's the only menu outside like six Goombas. Is this the final level? Yes, this is the final level! So of course it's going to be the final retro pipe too. There should definitely be lava in here somehow. I like this section here. I didn't think the day would come so soon. Well we still need to do the overworld and stuff, we're not quite out of the work yet. Oh, we're still in the middle. We could have these flamethrowers here to shoot flames off the volcano. After that it's time for the overworld or side courses, overworld. Do you have like a diff percentage or something between your head and your body? I don't know what a diff percentage is. Will there be one huge section or will we do it in different sections? The overworld will be all of Yoshi's Island. And of course there will be multiple sections. It can't be all one area, that just wouldn't fit. The retro section is not just level lava then, it's going to be every Mario 64 level at the same time. We're going to be retroing out so much. Yeah, I don't know if you've played the Wameg only up 64. I'm thinking of it kind of like that. Yeah, they're all levels in one. Very similar to that. Probably all levels in one, then we'll have to trip over the assembling. Isn't that kind of crazy? I feel like the loop of lava land section is more than just this. It should be like a lava somewhere. Oh, and the BPS patch is basically just the whole room at this point. Yo, we're casing it up right now? Where? Yeah, I think it will be fun. And it's also going to be such a cool flex to see all of the levels at the same time. What if there was just a lava section somewhere in here? Just like something lava came out of? We'll see. All of this looks so poopy though. Oh my god. It's just coming from nowhere here. I think there isn't much we can do with the loop of lava land then. Maybe it will be just this with some volumes coming out of stuff. You know what, this kind of has a Champions world vibe from Mario Odyssey and Mario Galaxy. Now that I think about it. What if this was almost backwards like so? No, I don't like it. I'm going to space them apart a little more. And we definitely need to remove triangles too, because this is too big right now. We can't have it be a flamethrower right away, that would make gameplay too difficult. And we'll let the player skip the flamethrower section there. Something better than a fireball spinner maybe? Maybe? In case you didn't know right there, it's not scenes perpendicular to the Billboards Trees and Maze game, or Bungie Residue, but it was always a low number when I'm talking about the points of trees vegetation. It's probably very expensive to render. Our main issue here is that we are running out of memory. So we have to keep this somewhat low detail. We also still need to add the area with the tentacle in Yoshi's house here. Remember that. What do we have here? Toxic Maze, Volcano Climb. Leaf Pyramid, Climb Pyramid, Fly from Pillow to Pillow using Wing Cup. Oh yeah, the pillows! So we were going to have it so that you climb the pyramid, and then there's a wing cup on top, and then you go from pillow to pillow. And what now? What did I say? Please keep note that when I'm streaming I am yapping, and when I'm yapping I do not remember anything I say. After two seconds, it's just out of my brain. Didn't take forever. Oh! The Yoshi squid has a home here. So, okay. You need to get to the bitpipe somehow, and I actually just didn't have an idea for it, other than to just say, uh... Fuck it, it's the squid Yoshi's house. On Star 6 he just comes by, says some alien bullshit language to me, and you can visit his home, and he has a bitpipe on his home. Yeah, when I'm yapping, that's just, uh... Careful memory talking. It's all gone after a second. Okay. So this is probably all we'll have from... Yeah, you get what I'm saying. We don't need more than this.  Even better when you place the triangles yourself. Huh? It's a daffodil edge. Okay. So this is going to be a little bit of a recap section. Uh, I'm not scared of the Nintendo Ninjas. I am fully aware that I might get taken down, but if that happens, we can use that to spin some PR moves, and just rewrite the game into my own custom game. Wouldn't be that big a deal. Like, yeah, they would get rid of my Mario 64 hack, but I'm just going to make my own game, and then, like, have more success with that anyway. So who cares? Hello, Zelda. Oh. Oh. Sorry for the hilarious number.  Exactly, that's the idea. This is a Mario 64 retro level, because it's the last level. Oh. I mean, they can't legally just tell me I can't make my own game, right? Like, I can just rip out their code and their assets, and it's entirely my own game. Nintendo is not the dictator of the world. Who cares what they say? No? Am I wrong for thinking like this? So many times I see it that people just assume that whatever Nintendo says just goes forever for everyone in every country in the world. But they don't make the laws. You can probably make this even without the wing cap. Definitely could have made that. And keep in mind, these are going to climb the wall, so... That will also be made. Then you can make this jump here. No problem. The thing you can do is wait for it to announce a release date, then three days before release, announce a new game, probably return to your island to fuck you over. I don't know. Have you re-ran it too, if they did this? I don't want to say, but I'm just going to replace Mario with my own character. Probably make a dinosaur that saves the other dinosaur. Return to Dinosaur Island, you know? Replace all the Yoshis with dinosaurs. Replace Bowser with a big fat crocodile. Stuff like that. Nintendo doesn't care enough about this? 100 viewers, that's true. I'm just a 100 viewer YouTube channel. Nintendo doesn't even know about me. They would never pay attention to me. The Moshi sent a big villain, Growser. I had some banger ideas, actually. In fact, I kind of almost want them to take a bow, because then I have an excuse to just turn this into my own game and sell it on Steam or something. I wouldn't have to justify it, really, to viewers. We will include Peach's Castle in this section. It's going to be at the end, with a Yoshi on top that gives you the star. Yeah. I'm not worried, yes. If Nintendo takes it down, perfect. I can re-run it, I can sell it on Steam, I'm going to be rich. If they don't take it down, also great. I get to make my mod. It's a win-win. No. No way, Bro just said, Keis doesn't have enough clout for Nintendo to care. He said it, dude. I guess I just don't have enough clout. It is what it is, man. If only I was more famous. Exactly, Fluxx, though. What the fuck do we even do out of Dian Dian Dots? Like, seriously. Huh? What even is there? I guess there's the submarine, we can make Mario Klan out of it. And the submarine, should I import the submarine? Let's get the submarine. O2 moment, yeah I'm gonna make sure, I have to make sure I compile with O2 so I can actually run the submarine here without my game lagging. Pulse action, ah Pulse feel, they don't feel diadox to me. Remember to compile your running with O2 case, that will make the performance so much better Have you thought about this before? I need to expand my ROM, fragment 128 not found, seaweed in the ocean tornado MrBeast64, dude I'm having a bang at MrBeast's video idea, I just hope I can make it in time Do I have an expanded ROM somewhere? Something's going wrong here I might just not have an expanded ROM Shit Where am I? No I actually just generally don't, what the fuck Can you not just import from a VCOM now at this point? Can't bug what they sue me over, it doesn't make any sense They can't just sue you for making a video game, imagine Oh wait that's not Mars Sunshine 64, that's the base ROM, shit Where do I find an expanded ROM? Probably on ROMhacking.com It should work I don't think I made this I don't think I made this game but let's see if this works Okay that works too, that would be great In the meantime let's think about what we do here Maybe this piece here into a little bit of the wood here where we keep using this wood Submarine and then from the submarine we just move on because there's much interesting stuff we can do Doesn't matter what they sue you over, they have the money coming So I'm not allowed to make a video game at all because I have to be fearing Nintendo suing me Just because I'm the guy they hate, that makes no sense You just switched a few assets, okay but there would be nothing Nintendo in there Like there would literally be zero Nintendo code in there Thank you for the extended ROM, that is going to make my life a little easier Where did I put it? Nooooo There it is There it is There it is Okay but what are you suggesting Yoshi Party, that I'm not allowed to make a video game at all because Nintendo can sue me? That's like an insane level of paranoia And that's obviously not how anyone can live their life I'm not allowed to make a video game at all Submarine you cannot blast someone to bring them down You do realise Nintendo took down over 70 of my videos, like I'm very clearly on Nintendo's radar You do realise Nintendo took down over 70 of my videos, like I'm very clearly on Nintendo's radar What's the texture used at the end here?  Ah Isn't it this texture? Nope that does not look right Yeah this game is definitely going to be taken down by Nintendo at some point That's why we do need a better plan with it How do you know I have a Honda Civic? Did you just guess my car? Did they get down because they're ashamed? I think so too Wait is this vertex coloured? Yeah it is this texture but vertex coloured I think this might be a rare vertex coloured moment in R64 Like so It's usually Nintendo didn't take them off on steam, that was just as a precaution It's usually Nintendo didn't take them off on steam, that was just as a precaution It's usually Nintendo didn't take them off on steam, that was just as a precaution Did they use another material with different lights on it? Are you sure? Because I have seen Mario 64 use vertex colours before They actually do that in quite a few parts, way more than you'd expect They actually do that in quite a few parts, way more than you'd expect You know what we can test this, let's just go there I know that they do it in a lot of places but I don't think they do it here I'm actually working on a video called Every Shade on Mario 64 So I have seen all of them So I have seen all of them The submarine isn't here Do you guys know how to get the submarine back? Anyone know? Put it maybe being 812077080020 And then... This Could that be? Anyone just randomly happen to know Mario 64 web addresses like that? Man I wonder if the submarine is back now Wait, I did it wrong I need more Maybe two more? How come the Dedede painting just moved? What was that? Like the first star? It's not even appearing on the first star They took down 70 of my videos, geez guy, yeah But nothing recent, it's been like... I think... 4 years since they last took down anything of mine Maybe even 5 Oh, they do use lights Okay, interesting We can fix this We can fix this Uh, shit Wait, how do I do this actually? No, we are making a retro section But no, you don't have autism, look, just because I'm good with numbers Don't hate me I would say close enough Sometimes you can see the signs I think I'm just gonna use this part here We need all that Who's this MattKC guy? Why do we care about his opinion? That makes him special This song feels very fitting for what we're doing here Hello, Kazi, it's that time of the month again Hello, what happened? Someone subscribed? Give me a second, I'll figure it out in a second Thank you BrailleDeBrew for the 34 months It's not, but it fits very well, decor It just kinda worked out like that Next is Snowman's Land So I think we're just going to have a snowman climb here I don't have autism by the way Yeah, there's KKef It's like all the Mario 64 stages in one basically It's funny that the ripper just can't handle Mario 64's fucked up UV coordinates And just does that sometimes Why are we looking at Mario 64 maps? Can you read the title of the stream? Can you take us? Can you title read us? Can someone read out the title, a note, for the whole world to see? What the fuck happened there? Did it just destroy itself? How did that happen? Did I do that? When big jimmy honestly fits very fittingly for him yeah i can see big jimmy energy coming out of him dude have you guys been watching the beast games actually is a banger i have this this theory that secretly mr beast is like sponsored by the fbi and they are like carrying out psychological experiments and like disguising it as game shows so is it worth to watch it's uh it's definitely garbage but like in an enjoyable way you know how like mcdonald's is garbage it's like garbage in that way what what the fuck happened my texture changed so but you need that much money to buy a bike that's the problem here the way mr beast does it like you don't need as much funding because you get some money back um case did you know that what you're looking at right now is a vanilla mario 64 model was that an accident did you accidentally recreate it because you love mario 64 so much are you aware that this is mario 64 case um hello am i the only one that sees mario 64 on steam right now no you cannot caleb i'm not just giving out the latest mario no i'm not just giving you the rty room i need to finish the game before i publish it but can i can i have your credit card info just wondering if you don't know what to watch you need to see severance dude it's so fucking good severance dude or just severance this the guy whose head is a toilet could be fun might give it a watch do you think yes in which you optimize them just a little bit spawn yourself it's fantastic i'm not gonna spawn myself me and zainab are currently watching the anime seven badly since we're like hate watching it because it's so goddamn awful and that's kind of fun to like hate watch it i'm a subscriber tbh if that's something you're coming clear about something you were ashamed to admit why the tbh is that like a bad thing to be subscribed so seven deadly sins isn't bad the two to three first seasons are dead sucks seven deadly sins does this thing where they like sexually assault the female characters and then pretend it's like funny that's kind of why i hate it to a large degree and also because like everything is super predictable and cliche the main character is just like the the anime meme of like forgive me master i need to go all out just this once and that's like on it does all the time if it's only fun facts it's like i'm sorry master i need to go all out search bowser in the randomized realm and mipsol wiki as soon as you said the words mipsol wiki i lost all interest in whatever you were saying it is green's dash but the retro sections is always different from the logo theme youtube has a lot less ads than twitch maybe that's why they don't go to switch  attack on titan actually would be my favorite anime if not for the fact that the anime like really sucked anything until after erin picks up the head then like becomes god is just stupid but right now my favorite by far is hunter hunter hunter hunter is pretty peak wow that's not two issues just now  yeah since this is not world access aligned it doesn't work at all so the ending kind of retroactively ruins the story for me hunter x hunter oh my god yes it's so good i actually read the manga first and then later found out an anime existed and that was so cool to read and to see i think i'm like the weirdest hunter hunter fan because my favorite arcs is greed island and the chimera ants and not yokno or whatever yokno left very little impression in me the ants arc is absolutely peaking oh that's cool rita did you enjoy them i like shows that have like interesting settings so greed island is just perfectly my taste and the camera dog is just that good okay vilebeck sounds like you're about to talk about swords that's online but i know everyone hates that one i'm not on the b3313 flight list i will not tolerate any such accusations sal is a really cool concept though i haven't caught up with the manga yet of uh hunter hunter because there was like such a long break around chapter 392 i think that's where i will stop it okay is this jump too difficult what do you think i mean i guess you can do this right that's probably what people are going to do and that's going to prevent bonks but that would get you killed okay this is easier for sure oh my god look at this vanilla mario 64 gg mapping i need to fix it what do you think of simba flips i like the guy but i wish he knew that bomb on battlefield was called bomb on battlefield and not bomb on battlefield it's like a rarely known fact that could work yeah we could really change the viper area that could be our challenge here making it so that it really feels like you're changing where you are so it does look a little bit like that alexa you would be correct  we hate to know blenda so well the bob-ombs in the second actually be pretty multiple they also used to be spreads for that um they used to be sprites because it looks a lot better than 3d models but the sprite looks very different it was much much higher resolution do do  remember the case once you're a non-Biobakanic like me i mean i don't understand your question my non-k slash Biobakanic you mean like what's my hack that i didn't make did i make Biobak i made Biobak i created them with my own two hands  hello solomon yeah i'm gonna fix the uv mapping i cannot tolerate what the original developers did here unfortunately okay i will die if i look at this for too long it is hazardous to look at this so so the bob stands for bomb battlefield and the bob in there stands for bob ombs battlefield and the bob in there  i haven't used mario 60 predator since around 2018 and there really is no reason to use it because you have much better tools like bomb engine nowadays so  It's mostly good to me now I'll maybe add a few more scenes to make the texture less punchy We Yeah, my CC was all over seems Music is basically the link and no They have metal harbor in the poopy sonic olympic games That's crazy I Would find it very hard to respond to a sentence that's not let's shoot. It's like I never know what you're doing Cannot evaluate your statement to true or false It's like your statement doesn't mean anything to me. You know what I mean? You Listen to Metallica. Nope Let's check how much room we have left 6-4 Levels in one is a retro section, I think it's a banger idea. That's not where I checked the ramp, I need this here later. Controller? How do I turn the controller on? Nothing. Okay, so this is clearly using less memory than we had before, which is good. The reason it may be using less memory than before is because what could have happened is that it moved the other segments to behind the frame buffer, because it detected an overflow in the buffers. So that would kind of be bad news, because it means we used a lot of data already. But it's also good news, because it means my code is working perfectly. This is such a cool retro section, and if you fall down, you can always step on Jolly Retro Bay. The sub is still made of stuff, I mean bad geometry. The sub is made of the same geometry, but it's not gonna lag, because it's not stupid Mario 64 code. Let's see, we only have the town left, then the slide, and then the thing. The weather in World Town is so funny looking, I kind of like it. It's gonna be the music, probably like a remix of Mario 64's OST somehow. I mean, what do we do with this? Is that what it's gonna be? I'm not 100% sure yet, we'll have to experiment with it. Oh, we're up to the middle of someone's face and make a hole looking like a... Funny idea, but no, we want it all the time, I think. Yeah, if you're romaking, definitely get a summer code. If you're not romaking, you can get a cheap logo from Everdrive from China. But I 100% recommend the summer code. We could just make like a few skyscrapers like this. Yes, oldie, but no, I don't want that. It'd also just be this section here, between the three houses here. And you have to jump between the houses. I think that would work. Just these four houses here. Yeah, I'm thinking the original pipe too. I think it would be funny just because like the original pipe looks so poopy by comparison.  wait, I deleted the house I wanted to keep. When did that happen? There. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. To be fair, the Sonic songs are already bangers, just like by themselves. A lot of Mario songs need a lot of help. I have to admit, Sonic just has better music on average. That's the one thing Sonic does right. Sometimes when I look at Sonic, I feel bad for the sound designers, because I know they did such a good job, and then the game is so poopy. It's like, imagine you do a group project, but some people in your group just do a terrible job and bring down your whole presentation.  Better music for R2-D2, but dup. I haven't played Sonic for 6 years, so I can't comment on that. But I have suspicion that when I play it, I will actually like it. I don't know if that's crazy to think. I didn't even like Mania, but I liked Sonic 1 and Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 a lot. Sonic Mania has the same problem as every other Sonic game, where it's like, you gotta go fast, but if you go fast, you will just hit a wall and you will not have any fun. And then the fastest way to beat the game is to just continuously run into a wall. If you've ever seen that Barrett Simpson has brain damage video, that's what I feel like playing Sonic. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,  yay! Have you ever thought about how you'd fix Sonic? I think to do Sonic is just don't. I don't think there's much you can do. You can try to like move the camera in a way that like maybe the player can see the level a little, but even that is not enough I think. That would probably take away a lot of the feeling of speed. I think the games just need a lot of experimentation before they ever showed up being good.  yay! So, um, we made a few layout notes, but the TLDR is we were just going at it. So, how can I make the player safely shoot the cannon over here? That's a challenge. I think I'm gonna have to use this building here as a blocker. Like so. So, something like that. Now you can safely shoot over here. No, I'm not Caleb. Why didn't we ever be in proportion to walking speed in 2D? I don't think that works in 3D. In 3D, sure. In 2D, nah. I need to check the REM again. You want to make a background? I'll go make a background, but I don't, I don't know if, I mean if you have a good idea I might use it, but there is absolutely no guarantee on me using it. So, there's 15 retrosections in total. Yeah, one per level. Okay, that's like 0x9000, and we should have around six, seven times as much space as that left. So, I think we'll be just fine with the memory. Hello, Zeina. We're working on the retrosection. It's gonna be a Mario 64 inspired retrosection. Kind of like the only up 64 hack. Oh yeah, I had a banger idea for the abandoned Bubble Dome retrosection. Let me see, let me see. I'd start this video here. We should do this. Like, instead of walls around the level, we should have a background like this in the Mario World 3 section. It's going to let the camera be so much more free and it's gonna look so much better. Hello, Sam Memory. I think in the last level we can ask people to do that, and as long as there's still a way to do it without using the extended movements, I'm fine with it, because you can just do this. I kind of want this game to be beatable without Mario's extended moveset. I don't know what's going on with the land over there. That won't make sense. Oh, I guess it's a rainbow flickering. Upgrades? It's an upgrade? Are we talking about grades again? I heard that the Alibaba summer card listings do not have all the features, and they're also not gonna receive any support from the developers, so get those at your own risk. Personally, I think that it's cool to support the guy that made it, but I also don't know that there's actually a significant difference between his version and the fake knockoff version. Okay, so a slide here would be giga cool, but I have a bit of a problem that since you can get the wing cap here, you might be able to just fly to the bottom of the slides. I guess if the slide is not too long, that would be fine. You can get the wing cap right here at the top of the pyramid. I want the player to be able to fly over here. We could move some of this up a little bit. That gives us 500 more coordinates. That's already pretty good. I think this is better than the anime for freedom. Yeah, but if it just trivializes the level that much, I don't like it. Like, if you can do some skips, I'm fine with that. Like, imagine using the merry-go-round velocity to jump over here or something. Or, you know, skipping from up here and then up here or something. That's all good, but if it just makes it completely trivial, I don't like that. I want player to at least be creative when they skip something, otherwise it's not fun. No XPM. Wing cap also requires the orient path. Yes, I also made sure that it's beatable without the wing cap here. So this is still beatable without the wing cap, it's just a lot easier with the wing cap. I think that is important, I agree. So, next would be an old slide, but I think for today I am done. I think this is it for today. I will see you guys in the next stream, which hopefully I can stream on Tuesday, but my parents are going to be over for 10 days. Next Saturday, my daughter is going to get baptized, so I can't stream. The next 10 days is just going to be super busy for me, so I don't know how much I can stream. Definitely not next Saturday, but I will see you guys in the next stream, whenever that will be. Bye!
