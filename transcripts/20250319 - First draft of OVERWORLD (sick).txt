Hello Lynx hello Maxwell hello I'm your cat hello Bingus hello Valze maybe Bingus I wouldn't be surprised if it worked I fixed a nasty bug today now I was discussing something with Sauron some important stuff hello Clayman I know Clayman hello Mimoski I fixed the end screen transition a little bit and it goes by faster now and the render bug is gone since those were the things people complained about look at it it's beautiful I like how it looks a lot our mission today is to do part four of the overworld hello Bon Amputee that's an interesting name hello Skyloft it's been said before but madness it first of all looks so good wait what you actually think this looks good it's supposed to look like dog shit yo this just popped up in my subscriptions let's listen to this hello Yiffy Guten Morgen Fräulein Übergang I had a teacher who would insist that you don't greet him like that in the morning because he said it's a waste of calories hello Yuffie Guten Morgen Fräulein Übergang I had a teacher who would insist that you don't greet him like that in the morning because he said it's a waste of calories and there will be more level reworks but it's mostly Biobank doing them I think he's almost done with course 2 now oh god the gates of hell have opened that sounds really bad we need an OST for today your zero volt it is the haunted mansion that's the actual sound wait you're right was that the sound all along Victor's haunt us as a furnace going on Mario was a stone young all right let's do it no it's him Boeing you are so brainrotted I don't like how far away this is I'm out of memory on my computer I don't like how far away this is I'm out of memory on my computer I guess I couldn't make the curvature like so instead and that would help make this a little smaller and I think we're gonna have to do that actually the furnace is gonna stop any moment now all right so this way we significantly shortened the need for the tunnel which is good good good this still fits nicely together mostly and I need to move all the warps here it should work let me just make sure it looks fine sick describes me I don't know why I just exported I clearly didn't even export this because I am genuinely very sick right now well I'm no longer very sick but I'm still sick please get slightly worse soon no I wonder if it would be easier to deal with this if this was just part of the first overworld what if part four was just a long cave I think that's honestly better just because keeping these areas equal is going to be basically unmanageable dude how long is that oven gonna go holy fuck it's because the oven is on the heater Yoshi party it's supposed to turn off after like two minutes but it just doesn't there's nothing I can do about it I could turn on the Nvidia broadcast but every time I do it keeps fucking up it is supposed to turn itself like just give it a minute I guess ah finally dude oh my god it stopped yeah there will be a vario operation And the game will be personalized Whatever dude See the thing is I'm a huge Rionu fan And I'm copying whatever Rionu does. Since Rionu made the Vauri operation, I have to copy the Vauri operation To the insert of 40 And I'm copying whatever Rionu does. Since Rionu made the Vauri operation, I have to copy the Vauri operation Hello Orson, sick streamer All of this looks like shit because it's all just debug visuals, don't worry about it Okay, new bug in DrakMario, let me just write that down Hello Alux Dude I've been sick for like five days, I don't think I've ever been sick for so long I should have been born in like 1300 and become a fish farmer I should have just been out hunting tuna, that would have been the life And then when I get sick I would just die because I can't feed me or my family Oh what a life that would be Great observation, that is indeed correct, I am now just sick Okay, let me just copy whatever Rionu does Hello Martin, well I'm slightly better than last time I really should have removed this, oh my god Shit, we need to add deathwarps to every overworld too Yes, the old hub sucked, I'm making a completely new one It's much better to decide on a hub in post than to do it while you're making the game The hub is the most important part, you need to make it with all the information available to you It turned on again? Do it! Don't worry guys, this time it's gonna turn up quicker, I'm sure Oh what a pleasant song, thank you for making my misery complete You know what we need now? Mario snoring, I would like to listen to Mario snoring on top of this No no, merry-go-round music This is fast64 I would never want to try to replace fast64, they're doing a really good job with it Sorry if I'm typing on offscreen, that means I'm typing to Soren He is discussing his animation compression idea right now, that might save a little bit of performance Yes, I'm actually thinking maybe we can do like a physical cartridge release of the game's OST Which would be the coolest shit ever Oh my god it stopped, finally Okay So Of just the OST I can't release the game physically and I will actually get murdered Oh my god Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Dude this is gonna feel so cool right? Is it just me thinking that or are you guys thinking that too? This part of the overworld here Do you guys understand what I'm making? I don't know if I've really communicated that at all Or if I've just been hammering away So distracted talking to Soren Now I explain Um okay So You start overworld 1 here And you see the whole lighthouse here at the top And then eventually you make a process through here, through here, through here You come to the third overworld You find the ice cap You go into the cave And then right now we're making the cave section And then after you come out of the cave section you're gonna be here up top at the lighthouse So you come out right up here Back where you first see the lighthouse And I think that's gonna be a really cool experience Yeah I think it is so cool Um I'm thinking it's like a tunnel platforming section or something There's gonna be something in there like an underground cave or whatever Or not really underground but like inside a mountain Let's make sure the connection works Oh we can definitely put a secret level in there yeah That's a slightly changed the beginning here and just so it's further in this direction so that it's easier to make the tunnel Oh Seamless by dynamic loading areas Yes That is possible You think we should have the entire overworld seamless? No warp transitions at all? I don't think so That's true Alright fine we'll make it seamless We're gonna make it seamless at the very end though Because making one area seamless requires knowing how the next area will look like and we don't know what the areas will look like until we're done with them Oh my god dude why does the heater go on again Need lots of lots for distant parts if you want to get seamless Nah I don't need to shit Oops This is what I have to deal with all day guys One let me out she said if you want to move out why don't you go back to Germany where you came from and I said that was rude and then she made the spongebob noise and that I think that's rude can you believe it so I mean we will have texture quality limitations or will they come as separate areas they will be separate areas but they will be seamless warps between the areas the one thing that's going to be a little weird for me to do is that this will have to be multiple levels right we'll have like castle grounds inside castle and castle courtyard they will all be in here but they will be separate levels and pre-loading the collision will be a bit difficult we'll see oh actually hmm shit making this perfectly seamless actually doesn't work because of compression shit it's warm enough in this room Yoshi party I don't know why the heater does that no I'm not streaming every Thursday Tuesday okay so there is a problem with making everything seamless and that is it takes a while to load some levels so what we could do is if the game just freeze for like 10 frames well okay collision would already be freezing that's the thing about this the game can't really render while a new area is loading in well we don't have enough memory to just keep the old area loaded while loading a new one I know Martin but I would have to do some weird stuff to even get that to work stuff I don't want to deal with and what's actually like reasonable for me to implement because I barely know make file that's actually my limitation here and I'm gonna change out a whole build system works either because when we go from one area to the next what we need to do is we need to unload the old area everything in it we unbuilt the graph nodes which means Mario can no longer be rendered then we reload the level area and rebuild the graph nodes so when say Mario goes through here maybe the game just has to like pause for a little bit I mean the game would already lag for like three or four frames during area transitions anyway all the areas are directly connected Yoshi party it's just freezing the game acceptable you well that's our sections should have the same corridor the switches when it's you won't see that it switches what's being run that Martin that's not an issue the issue is the loading time while we load the engine the way it is right now cannot render a screen wipe what is a screen wipe hello Dario why didn't you sound like Mario I really sounded like Mario yesterday you should have been there I guess this time I didn't get hit with the Vario too bad Mario's walking would you not keep walking but he's not in controls the geometry swaps we can't render at all while loading in this engine I'd have to make big changes that I'm not sure I'm willing to make yeah I'm mostly recovered now what I see it doesn't need to be what would be cool now it's not gonna be a black screen it could just be an image of the last screen you were at there has to be some sort of cute transition we can do something I was gonna play our game tomorrow yo thank you for the subriola bro there's only we do a large chunk of his small flex he might just spend the week doing it that's cool Dory I might actually watch it honestly I haven't been too big a fan of the chaos extreme so far nothing against simple it's just not my humor really entering a cave could be dark there's a cave loads in you could do a little fate like I suggesting that would hide a few completely blank frames well huh let me think about that what if we didn't make it so that when you go in a cave it's completely black first and you can't control Mario but then it just feels like a warp no that's just a warp maybe our best bet is to actually just put a freeze frame load the level and unfreeze the frame yeah I think we'll go with that that will definitely be my backup for now not sure we can actually just preserve momentum with that it's regular like instead yeah also kind of true hello FB can't believe the framebuffers in my chat no I haven't even liked minecraft like when it was a thing I guess it still is a thing but like I never played minecraft so of course I'm not gonna see a minecraft movie it also looks like it was made for actual toddlers and I'm not about to waste money on that a little work Yoshi party but you need like six of those and it's like how you're gonna think of six of those in random spots to oh my god the gates of hell have opened again today is a terrible day isn't it no OST yes OST but why the hell is the thing going on all the times I don't know is the heat on upstairs can you turn it off is it that wait so it's your fault that the thing is going on the whole time all the time today oh my god guys we found the reason I hear her walk above me it was Zena all along oh my god and it stopped immediately Zena do you know what you did I don't know make us the mic the noising that's only because Zena was doing that again we cannot render so long-ass tunnel well hmm there definitely needs to be something in there I don't know if the length is an issue how can I make it shorter though well I guess if this is seamless then we can move it here like so it's gonna cut a good bit of tunnel off this is probably a more acceptable length yes it will be seamless Zena at least that's the hope I think if you prefer this can we get it even smaller yes we can hello daily Delphox we are cooking part 4 of the overworld which is the tunnel connecting part 3 and part 1 so the first time you see the lighthouse you can't get there you make a bunch of progress in the game you find this cave and suddenly you're right next to the lighthouse and it's like oh my god I wanted to be here since the beginning of the game and now I'm here What the f**k here we go big ass banana this is a big ass banana what you mean what about it you mad also daily Delphox we decided that we want this overworld to just be seamless in the end so all the areas hopefully just transition into each other without destroying Mario or whopping or anything like that do new MLB season Major League Baseball basketball I think baseball is the worst sport there is it's like one person's playing and like six people are watching that person play yes yes Mesa that's funny daily Delphox but yeah that's the plan basically how long was it since you last ate? two hours is Pyro back in here? no. why are you asking when I last ate? so I'm hungry well I have barely been able to eat in the last few days because of how sick I am so okay this seems like a short enough tunnel though you can hear my stomach well what can I do about it man I'm actually not feeling hungry the good thing about being so sick that I can't eat and I turned into Yoshi from Mario Sunshine is that at least I have now a lower body fat percentage and I'm closer to my you know catechol isn't that amazing I can already see my abs because I'm sick see a body fat percentage probably like 15 maybe mix a oh my god my stomach is really making weird noises maybe it means I'm dying I made the fucking well if it's just the room you can't be destroying performance unless it's the we had the cloudcap level entrance here I definitely have maps bigger than this but this is just four parts out of 15 in the end so it's going to be like four times the size shit what do we do about the cloudcap so originally the back way was going to have a place with a cannon where you shoot into the clouds but obviously we cannot do that anymore I know cannon because it's not a cave unless we put the cannon up here I guess we could put the cannon up here wait this being like this sucks right what if instead there was a way to platform from here over here and then this is where the cannon was favorite book have you ever heard of the mists of Avalon that's a pretty good book oh geysers no but I like geysers to be around the volcano and this is so far from the volcano that I don't really want that or maybe maybe it's fine but then this is also like a huge mountain that I don't really want the player to like get on I think I'll just put the cannon here when you get to the wingcap stage let me look there's a cloudcap over where the koopa wave there's a cloud over where koopa wave cove would be in the overworld using the cloudcap and some platforming you can reach it and enter the wingcap imagine how annoying it would be to fall down here though and then not have the cloudcap it's legal to ask for donations for the game you couldn't but you'd have to be like really bad to miss that cannon shot no I don't think you can miss it realistically should we add a cloudcap here to the bottom so that as soon as you've gotten here once you have an easy time to get back up here I think that would be really cool but I'm also afraid that once you do that you will just be able to take the cloudcap and like walk anywhere you want right you could take the cloudcap and just jump over there hmm I don't think that works that is a good idea I like that shit this is what I need let me get the old overworld not this again that's honestly pretty doable by your back so rope that you can kick down from under the lighthouse so so ah yes the 40 second animation for that people will love it can the rope be a rope ladder oh no i don't want to do a ladder don't make me program a ladder i remember what doriel did yeah it was very funny she's just funny like that and she isn't talking about bread that would be funny daily but how would that even look like This is never gonna load, is it? Okay, so rope is here and you kick it down. Is it just gonna be pressed against the wall? Mario can't really climb it if it's pressed against the wall, because he's stupid like that. What if it was a vine? Like a jungle vine? I think that would work better. What the hell did they do? They changed this. I hate this. It's different. It's different. I hate it. Take me back. Country road. I don't know why it makes no sense, wait, what? Okay, well it needs to be a vine, right? Maybe it doesn't need to be a vine, maybe it needs to be a rope. I guess it makes sense because it's a lighthouse, a lighthouse would have a rope. West Virginia, mountain mom, yeah. It could be something else too, you know, it doesn't need to be a rope. Could be anything. We have freedom, we're creative humans, we can think of something else. There is going to be a whole jungle here, but not here, it's going to be like here. This whole part is going to be jungle here. Nope, this is for RTYI, this is the preliminary overworlds, it looks like dark shit because we don't do the visuals until it's done because we still make a lot of changes. Yes the other one is dead. This one here. There's no reason to use this one. Hello clams from Mario Kart Wii. I don't remember clams being in Mario Kart Wii. I guess I never unlocked him. Okay, so I do want the mechanism that makes it so that you can just come up from here, like from here to here as soon as you've been here once. We could go with our pipe idea and this would be probably a good tutorial moment for the  The idea we had, or I had, was that as you'd get further in the overworld you'd find corked up pipes and you can only uncork these pipes from one side. So there could be a corked up pipe up here and one down here and you can only uncork it from the top. So you uncork it and now you can just go through the pipe to get up and down. Right, the pipes are a good idea, that's for sure. The question is if the pipe is a good idea here. Corked up pipes, hmm. Yeah, I think using it as a teaching moment is a good idea too. And you know what? There's, I'm gonna call this the suspense treadmill. You always want the player to have suspense for something that's going to happen. What the fuck was that? And doing that with the Lighthouse works great at first, I think. Let's think about our suspense treadmill here. I just made that one up, by the way. You just grab the cork from one side, one side has a handle, and then you just pull it. Then I guess this place here builds some suspense. The other side here, for sure. For sure, for sure, for sure. Nothing new here, really. At least not until you get to, what the fuck? What happened? What? I don't know. Can I make the pipe red, like the light or something, that makes it less out of place? Well, yeah, there would be a bunch of colored pipes that lead to different parts of the overworld. The first part of the overworld would probably have like four or five pipes, like right away. Okay, I think I fixed the issue. Yep. Interesting bug. Let's attach it to the pipe room. You want to implement it? No, that's not it. But we need some fast travel. And I'm thinking using this as like a fast travel unlock method works. Like, to teach it. God, my nose, man. Fly up there. Doesn't work, because then you can just skip the whole overworld. I'm not doing shit with co-op DX. Nothing against co-op DX, I just have nothing to do with it. Can we do a pet peeve? Okay, Biobank, if you don't want pipes as fast travel, what would you like? I guess that's the question. Banjo-Kazooie has like cooking pots that you jump into. I don't want that. Donkey Kong has warp pads. Why does every game have this? Canons? Like a differently colored cannon that starts a cutscene to shoot you somewhere else on the island. Well, yes, pipes is the idea. The problem with cannons is that you'd have to have so many of them and they'd be back and forth. And I think it would look a little bad. But actually, now that I think about it, I think I want the first fast travel to be to part 3. And not here. Because imagine you're playing the game and you beat the first two levels. And you're like in level 4 and 5. And every time you turn back out in the game, you have to walk all the way over here again. That would be so annoying. Yeah, by the way, I agree with that. No, I wasn't saying we definitely need it here. Color coded Yoshis can eat you if you talk to them. No, no, no, no, no. You have to. No, that doesn't work. You have to unlock the Yoshis first. And also you'd have like two Yoshis on each side. I think pipes is the best way of handling it, to be honest. I think it's our only way of handling it. You have stats and you can warp over them. Man, what you're saying sounds tempting too. Imagine the pause menu here instead was a world map with a cursor. And you could move over the world map. And then you could warp to course entrances. Man, that's tempting too. Should we do that? Yeah, that sounds so cool. I think we need to do that. I think we're not forced to. God damn it. I will make a note. I will make a note. I will make a note. You unlock warp point when you enter the level? When you enter the level. Well, after you've watched the cutscene in the level. That's what I wrote down. Okay, then we're back to the original question. How do we put the robot in overhang? No, it will just fade wide and then fade back in or something. No owl. It's just fast travel. Okay. It doesn't have to be a rope. What if there's a very breakable rock here? And it's blocking your path usually from below. But when you ground pound it, you can destroy it. And then you can just wall kick up there. But wall kicking for a shortcut is a little too much, I think. Like for something so essential. Hmm. Hmm. I think this is awkward because like, it's not the type of over that works. Because like you can't touch this part, where it's actually like against the rock. If you touch this part more, it will just let go. I'm thinking of maybe something that isn't a rope. I'm thinking of maybe something that isn't a rope. Hmm. Well, a big tree wouldn't really look very destroyable, I guess. Hmm.  Ever been to a climbing park? Maybe there's something here. I've been to a climbing park and it was so lame because they always make you take like 10 minutes of security so you can walk for 10 seconds. Oh my god, this is so disappointing. Well, I was a little kid when I went. Hmm. Hmm. I feel like there's one piece of equipment on old windmills that works for this. And maybe not. God damn it, this can't be so hard. What the hell? How is this so hard? I'm just trying to figure out any way that works well that makes it so that you can do something at the top that permanently lets you climb back up here from the bottom. Anything works really.  It doesn't have to be a rope. In fact, I would probably prefer if it wasn't a rope. Now, do you already turn the lighters on for something else? That was also one idea I had. You just destroy a wall here and then you can walk up. But having to walk it for something so essential is not good. Bounce floor, but downstairs. Like there's a button, you kick it and it lands here and then grows. And we're not using that daily Delphox. I don't know if you were here for the map idea, but I think I prefer that. Get the tree be used somehow, sure. Okie Bay. What happens in Okie Bay? I just remember the waterfall in Okie Bay. Oh, and those long nets. Oh, no, that's too bizarre. We can't just retract the whole wall. Yeah. Such as pushes out a platform or stairs out of the wall. It's a little surreal, but maybe something that works. But really, I would just consider something like that a last resort. Yeah. I mean.  Something coming out of the wall would work. You can't. Yeah. Yeah. Peach umbrellas are an interesting idea. I don't just like stone stairs coming out of here. I think it needs to be something that actually like makes logical sense. I know Mario is kind of a surreal game and you can do random stuff like that. Kind of, but I prefer to keep stuff somewhat sensical. We need a mechanic that you unlock by being up here. Placeness. Yes, placeness is the correct word. We don't do any visuals right now. We just do purely gameplay. I'm clueless on this. Yeah. Yeah, destroying the Yoshi stone would be mean. Yeah. Robot. Sure. But I don't understand how your overhang is supposed to work. I guess. Okay, wait. Maybe I started 3D geometry of it wrong. Maybe what you meant to say was. Okay. Okay. Something like this. And then you kick it down here and you can go up here. That kind of works, I guess. Okay. I don't see this shape working, but we can try this shape here. Okay. Hello, Sonic the Hedgehog. Okay. Okay. The Lighthouse does not do that. The Lighthouse opens Course 5 very explicitly. Bro is saving the time of his life. Okay.  The B param 3 that I have to set to 1. All 12 main courses are done, but Biobank still will rework a lot of them. So there's still lots of work to do.  What the fuck? Did I notch? I have a B param here. Two. It's two and not one. It's been a long time coming, dude. And it changed a lot since the first announcements. I also do think that in a way you are going to be the bottleneck. But you also have to keep in mind all the stuff I still want to do. Plus, hopefully I can make like a legally distinct version of this as well. So in that sense, you will have a lot of time. Okay. I think I can let Maru climb a little bit higher. I don't feel like I'm hard-pressed to release this as soon as possible, though. So I think we're all good. That's true. But you're almost done on DDD, right? Since January isn't that long. I've spent over half a year on a level before, right? Alright. I don't actually know how long I've spent on any of my levels. It felt like Course 4 was the level that took the longest. Or maybe Cooper Carnival. But Course 14 was really fast. Course 15 felt really slow at first and then really fast all of a sudden. Course 13 felt pretty fast. Course 12 felt pretty long. Course 11 felt decently long. Course 10 felt super fast. So now that we have that, we still need to fill the cave with something. And I probably want a side level in this cave here somehow. Well, if you have the outside done and the poochy area, then yeah, I think you have most of it for sure. But for today, I think I am done. It's not even my stream day, so it's actually crazy I streamed that much today. So I will see you guys next stream, which is probably going to be on Saturday. Bye bye!
