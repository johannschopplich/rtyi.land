You you you you wait I don't even have a microphone on so impatient yeah you're like why are you clicking on it the new clip was nice I didn't like I was so busy I didn't even see the comments yet Oh various jail right all right did you send me the penguins yeah I don't think I sent it to yet hello some guy hello onion no wallpaper wallpaper my background no my background is just a black pixel that is optimal otherwise I can't see shit on my desktop all right I'll just send penguin let's we need all the baby penguin animations which is just like walking and a little waddle get a little waddle and a dive you see which one of this if wait too many apps on your screen I don't have they barely have any apps on my screen it's all just files and I need those files oh boy okay this file is completely fucked it's gonna be a bit weird for you to use oh no you're gonna have to make a t-pose it's just Mario 64 and I'm amateurs someone on Twitter making a Metroid game all right dude f3 this year is gonna be so hype there were so many good trailers it will actually be insane you guys will love it 3ds part of unleashed that sounds cool I'm never gonna play unleashed but like just the fact that they're remaking it in a 3ds is neat I finished making only up 64 it's releasing tomorrow I do not want a well f3 is in two weeks the submission deadline ends tomorrow after that I'm gonna look at all the trailers again see which ones I think makes sense to showcase hello chili gamer all right we were working on this part and that's the problem right now I see dude I don't think anyone can easily beat the only up 64 game I had trouble beating it and I cheated on beating it it's so difficult my diving doesn't cause that to happen anymore that's not good no I think there's gonna be less than 10 people told her that be that oh yeah any OST wishes today there's a more 6-4 only up yeah I just finished making it that's releasing tomorrow I don't know what's going on this is completely broken yeah you need to make a t-pose I know I need to make a t-pose but I can't really do that properly why not look when I when I select the yeah reset to transform no go into the animation select them all all G it was okay guys I will show you a secret preview of only up 64 life on stream right now it releases tomorrow less than 24 hours from now also if anyone has an OST wish let me hear about it here you go the game's just like this and then it goes up forever that's like this and it's 28.5 minutes just to get to the top it's a really really big level yes it works on real hardware it even hit 60 FPS on your hardware why didn't you record an N64 I have a very short segment where I just showcased it working on N64 recording an N64 is shit because I have like two seconds of input lag and there's no way I can beat the game with two seconds of input lag why doesn't this work this is so weird oh wait that should do it didn't be any same capture card as for Zana no I got one for free from like if people that wanted to give it to me for testing it was some weird Chinese capture card dude that's actually insane I often get emails from like Chinese manufacturers that I like oh you want you want to try this thing for free and I always say yes and they actually send it to you I got a monitor I got like a capture card I'm getting new speakers right now I don't know why they just give it to me but they do there was also like a projector they gave to me because they wanted like an Amazon review I just got that like they just sent me a projector to my home for an Amazon review I think good quality it's the best capture card I've ever had I mean I only had two capture cards but you have lighting on in the retro vibe and buddy brushwoods you should probably fix that at some point I think I did that on purpose we still need an OST you guys want to listen to the Andrew Tate OST Andrew Tate OST top G themes lyrics Andrew Tate's theme this is his theme and are you setting the right oh that's not good wait how's that possible my sister Andrew Tate's theme oh I see I see Nina oh I know why there's a lot of things that set light in the disperse just because it's a gold for 64 materials but in game in the GPI I made it so that doesn't work so they don't actually set light in game it's just looks like it I miss your party proposal twice unlucky and then I thought of putting cars into one of my romances yes I mean I'm not I'm sure I did but I don't know when or why you should add better triple jump case you should you should add better Luigi and like make him have eyes that are like bloodshot and then it will be hyper-realistic scary scary with hyper-realistic bloodstains that's made out of juice yeah sure dude how come bio bags not here this would be like his theme song dude what if we just start calling this the Biobak theme song and then when Biobak asked what his theme song is we pull this up and it's just fucking annotated in front of a Bugatti Biobak would hate that but he's French so he's gonna be like yeah the song's and then we put it up and it's just we got him yep I went with it after all oh yeah you guys want to see some funny shit so you know how if a Romic is difficult you just save state and you know the safe state let's say I'm here and I mess up oh no that's not a safe state it just says no cheating and you're done play I know input works anymore nevermind about beating it yep are you able to detect safe state is it easy hard like you can just detect sudden memory shifts or something yeah pretty much it I detect whether the EP ROM desyncs from the memory state yes I made it for the simflips troll like competition it's not really that much of a troll heck but like free money you know if you submit to the troll like competition someone was gonna just give you money so I don't think only up 64 qualifies us very fun and punished but I don't know then that will be up to you then try a $20 dude you're trying to buy a house right now I need those $20 can buy you like three sandwiches why are you getting your sandwiches look if you go to a store and you just buy sandwich bread I bet you can get like a whole loaf for like $5 and then you just get like two packs of salami you're gonna get like 20 sandwiches for $10 but if I found an epic intro but I haven't used to that how do I got any new no I think I don't know if only ups growth was like organic or if they paid off the streamer so multiply it I can't even really imagine that you know that was organic don't keep cold this song is sick you're gonna pay me in 2008 I can be in 2008 money with inflation it's basically like nothing now I can show you guys on the up on the n64 real quick even give it anti-aliasing can you do music Your mom switched to vegan? Dawn! Thank you for the two months sub! How's the bowser already going? Pretty well. This is something else I did in the meantime. This runs on N64 and it's the biggest I've ever made. Oh yeah, we also, you know, only up as NFTs. Instead we have stupid Gats. Yep, it works flawlessly on N64. Maybe I should add that. Maybe I should. Now that I know that slightly added description here. Yeah. Oh, I see. That makes sense later. Let me just see how this looks right now. Um, wrong hack. Hello, Sea Wrangler. It's just false advertising, I'll sue. No, that's fair advertising. That's the first time I saw that crash on N64, by the way. So it's not like I knew of that. But now it's too late, I already submitted it. Well, these Koopas like each other very much. They're giving each other very nice warm hugs. Does this look okay for a T-pose? Yeah. All right, I guess these are going to be very small, so the fins coming out don't really matter, do they? Coming out? Like that. Oh, that's not on the original rig. All right. That's just the original rig. Yeah. They're not moving when I move them. Interesting. Why would they not move when you move them? Oh, wait. That's why. And then this is probably too high. I can't spend 25 minutes in a row. What? Oh, this definitely happened. Oh, interesting. Dude, I, yesterday night, I was thinking about some stuff and for the first time in my life, I have used the cosine approximation in real life. Dude. Have any of you ever actually just used the cosine approximation? Am I allowed to change the name of the bones? Sure. Okay. Well, I need to know what the cosine of five degrees is. So, like, how was I going to do that? I had to approximate cosine. Okay. There are no animate existing animations later. She's making all of them right now. Yeah, I work as a programmer. Can have their nose in the glass. That's not very good. I have to change that. Yeah, they're carrying glass. What did you think it was? Do you think they were just like bumping into it? You just have to turn his head. Turn their heads. Yeah. Okay. They only have very stubby little arms.  No, Zaina is not writing chats. She is working on her own stuff. It is against my NDA to do that, Nicholas. I can't. I'm going to moderate chat sometimes. Well, yeah, but that's not like your purpose here. No, no, no, no, no. I'm just helping out with animations. And anything else that he needs. Oh, yeah, we have new sign approximations to a new agents approximation. They're going to be so much better. Now, what I need to do next is move the glass by the animation frame of the Cooper's. 13 frames. 12. 13. 12. Okay, so every 12.5 frames, they need to go up and down. So every 25 frames is a full rotation. So 0x1000025 is 262. Okay. So. That should do it. Hello, Elsie. Oh, Elsie. I remember your name. I watched your tutorial for a head-on-time modding to make that head-on-time mod. Okay. The face is a bit offset from what it should be, I think. Yeah, it's like doing the opposite of what it should be doing. So let's add. That's so hype. Is that how you found my channel? Through that head-on-time mod I made for like that summer thing? Or did you just know me without that? The offset's not perfect yet. Oh, I see. See, the thing is, at Gears for Breakfast we have like something called a toybox day where we can just work on anything Gears for Breakfast related on that we want to. And for summer we got like an extended three-day toybox day where we're allowed to make any summer thing in head-on-time. So I just made like a little summer mod and I used your tutorial for it. Yeah, working at Gears is super chill. It's actually funny you say that, because at the game we're working on right now I have been doing a lot of optimizations. But to be honest, it still runs kind of like ass. I don't know how much I'm allowed to say, though. I don't want to break my NDA by accident. But I'm sure it's gonna be very, very good. I have a lot of optimization ideas. No, it's not a physical building. We all work from home. I don't want to work in a physical building. That sounds very awful for me. Hello, Sunset Bear. All right, so now we have them moving up and down. Next, we need them going back and forward. Ah, they can't move this direction, actually. This actually has to go here. Oh, no, the update order is fine. Sure, what is it, Leila? VS Code 2022. I don't think I have 2022. I think I'm on 2019. I thought you weren't a part of Gears anymore? What? I only started like a few months ago. Why would you think that I'm not part of Gears anymore? Who put that in your head? I'm using that O2 style. Every time I talk about optimizing Mario 64, someone brings up O2. That is such a small optimization and it's not even good compared to OS. Is it compiling a save? No, I just compile right here. It doesn't take very long. Look at this. It's done. But O2 makes a big submarine not like... Okay, you know what else makes a submarine not like? Fucking using static collision instead of dynamic. Okay. Does this even work? So this is from 1 to 39. And this is from 40 to 79. So this has to be 79 and this has to be 78. And I need... Should I have the game? That's pretty good optimization. True. We can run a black screen 500 FPS. I try using fog, of course. Everyone knows that rendering more pixels is gonna make the game run faster. All right. They work forth and they never come back. Because I forgot to set this to minus 5. Also makes sense. What's the record for this gonna be? It's decided already, but I forgot what I decided on. All right. I like this, but I think I want them moving forever. We also need a cool glass shattering effect here. Like, are we just gonna have pieces of glass that gonna move everywhere? Hello, Foxblocks. I feel like I just did this wrong. Wait. Okay. I know what I did wrong. I just need to do this. Yeah, luckily compiling in N64 ROM doesn't take a lot of work for a modern computer. No. No, they work too fast. Too far. I can just move them back. Oh, God. I didn't even know you have to recompile mods at all. I thought you just used the stupid Kismet thing. Programming in Kismet is the worst. Although it is better than Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints. At least I think so. I think everyone else would disagree, but I think it is better than Blueprints. I'm sure Elsie knows. I mean, that's how basically everything does it. And I'm sure that's how ahead-of-time mods do as well. Yeah, I mean, I quickly noticed how awful Kismet is. I mean, it's the same with Blueprints. Obviously, just compiling in real code is way better. Okay, let me think about the glass shattering effect. So what we want to do is that if you do this, the glass shatters and the Koopas just lose their will to live. I probably want a bunch of small glass pieces. I don't think I want to make five full pieces and then half the whole thing shatter as it looks. Having so many glass pieces would be an issue. Can I close the neck hole in the penguin? There's a neck hole? Yes. He just has a hole in his neck. What? Right here. Let me look at the penguin. Do you want me to just send this to you? No, I'll just take a look. He just has a hole in the top of his head, of his neck. But why is this here? Oh, his face is supposed to be there. Yeah. Oh, but like when you're diving, there's the hole that opens up like this? Yeah, that's why. Oh. So am I okay to close it? Yeah, you can just close it with blue. Okay, perfect. It's just compile the ROM and you're done. Hmm. Yellow balls all over the screen particle? Nope. No, thank you. You can make a particle effect. What? Like 2D particles? I'm not sure if like sharp glass fits 2D particles well. Usually like the 2D particles are for like soft stuff. Yeah, I saw that. I think you did like a boss fight. Star told me like people are doing insane stuff. And I hadn't time once and he showed me like some examples. That looks like a small transparent triangle. So can I just shoot into the air? Yeah, see what I'm thinking though is we could just take this glass plate and we could cut it into pieces. Like predetermined pieces and then we could have the pieces just like fly off. And I think it would look fine. Is this animation going to be replaced? This walk animation? I wasn't planning on doing that. I could have them walk back and forth instead of sideways. I think that would look a bit better. Like just rotate them 90 degrees. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Make the physics using blender. But like damn that's going to be so much work again. And I also need like so many different object geolayouts for that. And then something needs to happen after the glass pieces land. Yeah, I'll say I just didn't even know how to make a script back when I made my mod. That wasn't like in your tutorial. So I just was like, okay, well, I guess I can't use the scripts. I kind of don't want the glass to just linger around and like be a nothing object. Let's see if we can find any inspiration on Google Images. Yeah, like little glass pieces like this. It's the same thing. Actually, I don't even know if you can do additive new game. What if I just make a bunch of really small glass particles and they just fly off? Or we could also just make it so that if you do this the glass gets like a huge crack in it and then you do it again and then something happens. Like you do it once, there's a huge crack, you do it again and it just pulverizes. The pieces approach would look nicer, maybe. The problem I have with the pieces approach is that it's going to be a lot of like individual triangles or a lot of individual models unless we separate this into a bunch of triangles. The pieces on it. It could just be two pieces, yeah. If we just make two glass pieces that the splitters into, they just kind of like fall away. I don't think we even need the physics simulation for that. No, what's not fine about that is that I have to import so many small pieces. Not that they would actually like the game. Just like the physical amount of work that that would be is just not what's reasonable. I don't know Spinbolts, I just pronounce it however I feel like in the moment. Ideally I would be able to turn this into two pieces that I can cut separately. So you know what I mean like this kind of. So and then we have just two pieces that each look like this that just kind of split in the middle. I think that kind of looks shitty though so let's not do that. That looks too perfect, yeah exactly. So you only needed two animations for the penguin, right? Yep. So just one where he just hops and slides in a waddle? Pretty much. Well he also needs to get up from the slide. The pieces approach is the only good one on my window. Just use a switch button should be a bit less work. I think we should just have two pieces like this and then you kick it and then just kind of splits like this it falls over and to kind of spin away and that's it. So what's the idea? Uh where is it? I already mentioned Goombas running fast. I already said to mess with last first time so it would be a bit harder. No you only mess with them once. Your idea has nothing to do with what we're doing here. The idea is just that you mess with a bunch of NPCs and you just mess with everyone once. That's like the whole mission. There's no point to doing this other than like messing with them for the one mission. Oh yeah you guys haven't heard it yet but Badub made a soundtrack for this level. It's not finished yet but he has some pretty good ideas. So no there's no iteration since you're the last. So so right now I'm looking for the code for like a breakable door I made so we can just copy paste that. Yeah it's the first time I've seen ULC so that checks out. Maybe for the winter event if we have one I'll make another head of time mod. I'll have to see. Doesn't really fit the atmosphere. I mean he's still working on it so I was also thinking that some of this wasn't perfect yet but I like a lot of the ideas on this. What do you think the atmosphere is Lilo? Did I scroll past the thing that I want? Comedy gate. Lookout door this is what I'm looking for. So how many levels until complete? Four after this. I could tell you stuff about F3 but do I want to? Can you just like wait? So why can I not type? So I think act dive and then act bonk. So like in a more active level in the middle of the day. I see I kind of wanted to sound like grimy but also kind of comedic. That makes no sense for a music description. So he looks so done in this. I mean my animations are pretty good with these koopas aren't they? Yeah they are very expressive. So please tell them I created Super Mario 64. Okay Lilo I created Super Mario 64. It was all me. I did it. I'm sorry guys. The secret's out. Okay now if I bonk this the koopa should get sad and nothing else should really happen. All right let's see. Let's see how how it goes. It's still missing the glass animation. I feel like they should have a little bit of a reaction time. I think that would be very funny. You ruined it. So we got the very angry koopas and we got the sad miserable koopas that are just trying to do their job. Now they should have some delay. Koopa violence. Have you seen any of the other koopa violence in this level? This one's the funniest. Look at them. Step off kids and man's fresh. I don't want to see ugly footprints in there. So just... You ruined it. He's so angry. And we got this guy here. He's just chilling. On a very wobbly ledge. I don't know. I think I think that's a skill issue if you think eating your lunch there is a good idea. Yep. What does he get for having that? Get fucked bozo. Yeah that guy has skill issue. And we have these guys here. Back off pipsqueak. I'm in a prime spot to be made part of that fine building up ahead. So no cutting line or I'll crush you. Well fuck you then. I fucking love this. So eating on company time is a beast though. Dude lunch break is supposed to be paid. That's like an American concept that you don't get paid for your lunch break. That's insane. So yeah I'm definitely not getting that reference uh TJ. Smart not from Brooklyn. Yes I'm pretty sure they have labor laws there too. What do you mean? You go on lunch break you're forced to be at work and they don't pay you for it. That's fucked up. Not paying for lunch break when you're working from home fine. But if you are there at the company. But Brooklyn is in the US. No. Wait. Wait is it? What the fuck it's in the US. I thought Mario was Italian. I 100% just assumed Brooklyn is in Italy because Mario is Italian. I mean Bowser definitely doesn't have labor laws and he doesn't follow OSHA either. He has OSHA blocked on Twitter. They keep trying to message him. So I randomly had this thought. Why don't more games have a controller plus mouse button layout? You know what I mean? Controller plus mouse that would be perfect. I think controller plus mouse is the future. I mean y'all are just randomly on my page. I thought I was gonna have to fight so hard for people to accept that that's a good idea. But you guys just agree with me crazy. This is the third overworld. I mean controller plus mouse might go back and forth. Okay think about this. I think you're playing a shooter right? So you have your mouse in one hand to aim. Because aiming with the mouse is the best. But now in the other hand you can move. And the crazy thing is you can aim that direction. And you can move like five degrees offset from that direction. If you have WASD keys you can go 22.5 degrees or zero degrees offset. So you're in five degrees of the direction you actually want. Because you're limited. Because you only have a keyboard. So that way keyboard and controller plus mouse is like the perfect layout. The only thing that allows you to play at your peak. No it's the best for sure. Why didn't you use xbox controller to remote the cam? Or just use keyboard WASD? Because exactly what I just explained. Technically the Wii is the closest that got to it. Because the Wii had like the pointer and the stick. Which is honestly like the best thing yet. You need a special control. I don't look at me. I'm doing it right now. Controlling your left hand. Exactly that's the one I move with. Interesting. Yeah I mean gyro also works. Gyro is kind of similar to mouse. The thing about the mouse is though. You can go as fast as you want in any direction. And gives you that fine tuning. The control stick it's like limited how fast you can go. It's so small that like you're not really that precise with that i find never saying what what am i saying wrong the walk left is trying to prevent me from saying gyro so and you really need more than a kind of election the first person should i know all the time every single second oh actually we have an issue here i don't know is it an issue yes it is i need to change this 75 is not good 100 okay 100 is good we need the pivot here so oh it's not even a behavior yet man we have insane political comedy on chat today thanks guys i feel so informed now so he's talking about gerry political i guess it now is yeah then there's also true lz i like buttons but i like keys too one controller i like it honestly this one here i use this for smash fucking sick it's like a million buttons a second he's showing off his box his big dumb box it's not big and dumb what would you it's big for sure it's not dumb i like it inbox that's just the the b0xx the box i think the hitbox is shit because like the button layout is bad but i don't know maybe that's just advertising from the box so  all right i got that we also need them so now what they would do is they would just fall over that way we also need to fall to the ground first so so so the home is just gonna be the proxy floor position works for me so dude i can't even stand celeste because it has eight directions and i can't stand games that have limited directions i need all of them when you use a keyboard you should program everything with a wiimote true i guess because skill issue or something so don't imagine if in programming instead of writing this arrow we add another symbol like a star or something to just read the pointer we would save so much time okay we have a beginning so so this is a lot of just hard-coded shit but i think it should be fine like it should look good so it falls so softly and it barely opens up glass piece here i guess we need to make it fall for a bit longer we just kind of need this to look good enough to be like convincing that these are actual physics and not just us hard-coding a bunch of stupid stuff okay i know what's wrong so all right this should be good now comes advanced physics program with case yep we're just gonna fake it so we don't actually have to write a physics simulation okay okay okay okay they fell the wrong way but it's getting there what lila you said skyboxer the skybox is not finalized yet the skybox right now is just like physical thing in the level but it's supposed to be an infinitely far background in the end rip did they say anything after it breaks no they can't even interact with them yet maybe you should be able to talk to them i think you should be able to talk to them maybe like a um i feel like the glass you already want to break it without ever talking to them though yeah so we don't actually need to make them talkable beforehand oh it's broken oh no our table it's broken i should steal the sound effect from there oh just to have them say that that was the only glass window they had bowser's gonna be pissed it's gonna be something like that yeah that was the only glass we had bowser's gonna be mad yep i think that's a good one yeah no it's actually should be fine uh all right let's make them interactable so is this with rotation or without i think it's with who calls him koopa did you just make me call him koopa cool he softbucked me i know why he softbucked me wait i can just do this hitbox so really i thought it was like dr eckman and dr robotnik thing but i can't do that sorry is so cute all right what should they say after you break this shit they should definitely talk about like how boza is taking this from the wages or something that's gonna come out of my paycheck um what mess is here it's b perm two oh no it's b perm four uh this is three four no three four three minus two five six shit i should be able to just know but i don't and then that's 87 so that's five seven and hex okay so it's got an ultra walk what what did i do this time i do have like i have more than 20 yoshis actually a lot more um um there goes this year's salary um see this guy should talk about how he was saving up for retirement or something i have to take another one i don't know this is just what i'm thinking someone like this should definitely be here hello zero volt i don't have a basement ratchet i'm just gonna make sure you can't talk to them right now okay good that's the wrong text and that is also the wrong text uh cool i think i put it to b perm one then uh i think both should end with three ellipses actually he sent a second version of the yoshi's island night theme all right let's listen to it real quick zero world is making music right now for one of the 8-bit sections in this game oh man i can't even hear it all right so i just turned on the screen and it sounds really good i like it then but also remixes one yeah i think he's porting the loops one  he's allowed to make some changes to it to like improve it if he thinks he can improve it oh i set the wrong b perm oh this is nice so i like that a lot it's pretty nice so hello lemon guy it has been a while what would you say about in regards to the actual game life of others i'm wondering you're different nowadays back when i was making last impact i was just like whenever i had an idea i would just put it in almost like unfiltered and i would definitely like think more about what actually is worth putting in and less like just put stuff in you know when i made last impact i spent like maybe 10 no 5 of the time designing and like 95 of the time working but i should have been spending at least 20 of the time designing all right these are perfect now so did i spell salary wrong i did oops all right we have all the five trolls now wait no one troll is missing and that is the oil slick here please try to fix the lighting issues please and they will fix themselves don't worry i will just randomly stumble upon it at some point like i don't care right now honestly it's probably the box here now that i think About it. It has to be the box. It's the knighting issue gone. Did I fix it? I fixed the Leelanog. Alright, I'll fix the box real quick. This sounds like Banjo-Kazooie. I don't have a blender file of the box. No, it was never exported. If I would re-export it, it would just work. Yeah, that's what I was talking to begin with. Dingus. Why do you want to avoid using the word Dingus? Okay, so this is the one thing I'm least sure about. So the way this was intended to go is there would be an oil barrel here and then be a oil barrel down and the guy would just slide off. But I think kicking the oil barrel is not intuitive and also that's not very funny. So I'm not really a fan of that. I'm gonna so sweaty here. Oh my god. It's summertime. The notesics are funny. That sounds like But I don't think it's very comedic to just have that happen. And it's just so unintuitive. I don't think it's worth it. I think this mission would be better for trolls. True, same Leela. I have to go to the barber tomorrow. I was just gonna cut it off, but she won't let me. No, I have to look at you. You're gonna get it done by someone who knows what they're doing. Woman moment. I would just go bald. I don't care. I'll keep you there. I'm glad someone agrees with me. Thank you, Leela. This is so stupid. See ya, Ratchet. Bye bye. Shave my head when it gets hot. Dude, I did that once and everyone thought I was being a Nazi because I was bald. And usually when you're bald in German, people think you're being a Nazi. That was not nice. So that's the one reason I wouldn't go bald. Yeah, I don't wanna do the oil thing. I want something else. Or just nothing. Those are the two things I'm contemplating right now. Hmm. Okay, I'm gonna make use of the banana peel and do something to slip on it. No, I feel like these are just too cryptic. That's the thing about it. This is bad because it's just so cryptic to just kick over the random oil barrel. Who would think to do that? Fair, Leela. So I think to do it if the oil barrel is dripping and flowing from the top. Maybe. But it's still just not worth it for the little bit of comedy here. Cut off a crane cable. Hmm. We can also just go with only four ways to mess with them. Like that is completely fine. And I think that's what I'm gonna do. I think oil guy is gone. So we need the overseer here who's gonna be a wiggler. And every time you mess with one of them, the overseer is gonna get a little more upset. Okay, but how would he get to start from actually? I haven't really. He's just gonna be here. He's after you did everything. He's gonna be like, oh my god, we're not getting any work done. And he's just gonna run off and like spawn a star, I guess. Where is he gonna run off to? He's a different color layer to me. I already have that later. That is what I do. So that is perfect. I swear I have a different color layer. I don't even have a light layer right now. This level does not have the performance left over from manual hard shadows. Especially if you think about stuff like this. Like how am I gonna make the shadow for this on the floor? Throws himself into the oil. He definitely has to quit somehow. I don't think he should just, you know, commit suicide. That would be pretty fucked up for a video game like this. He should just run off somehow angry. Yoshi does it in SM64. That is so weird though. Like, why would Yoshi do that? I think Mario 64 does it is a bad excuse overall. Just because Mario 64 does so many stupid things. But he's a wiggler. Has to be a wiggler because he gets angry. And he has to be like a special character. So it'd be cool to use this wing cabin. I agree. I kind of want to add one now. Oh, but there's a problem. If you can use the wing cabin, you can get to areas that are not supposed to render. Eh, maybe not. Okay, we're just gonna... We can just have him run like from here, over here, over here, and then onto the distance. And then he just disappears after the cutscene. Just invisible walls? I don't wanna. It's gonna be so disappointing, isn't it? Okay, do we have a wiggler mod already? I know we have like baby wigglers, but I don't think they work here. Dude, having the first mission done is gonna feel so huge. Yeah, we have this. I think we need a new wiggler model. Wait, what's the difference between this baby wiggler and the adult wiggler? Like realistically. Size? Size, that's all? Oh wait, doesn't the baby wiggler not have legs? Yeah, that too. But is that all? All right, I like the prim color setup here. No lighting. Oh yeah, this doesn't have lighting. Because it's such an old model, it didn't have that on by default. There we go. There are no doors in this level. I'm not making a bully the bullies mission. That's too lazy. Rex product, fine. Let me fix this quick, real quick. I probably have to re-export almost everything anyway, so it doesn't really matter. Like once fast 64 improvements are in. What did you say about the wing cap? Like with the speed thing? We can just define bounds for the wing cap where like the wing cap can't fly. The one thing I don't want the wing cap to go is like behind here. All right, fine, fuck it, we're just gonna add a wing cap, just for the fun of it. Not required for anything. Maybe there's like a secret wing cap up here. Can you get here? Uh, which one's the wing cap one? I think it's zero. Let's see if I can get the wing cap real quick. Um, I think it's just gonna be an invisible wall, like a soft invisible wall, not a good shock one. So I know you can make this shot here, I mean that's what the crane is there for. But how do you get up there? Oh wait, I see a way to get up there. This is gonna be like such a hard wing cap to get. So I could just do it from the rope, but maybe the rope will have collision. All right, let's just use the rope. I'm sure this is possible. God damn it. Oh, because the rope is still solid and there's not an actual rope yet, that's why. Okay, but you can definitely get up here. What the hell was that rotation? Yeah, I like this. And like the only invisible wall we need is like here. No, that's like a cool stupid bonus. That's the kind of stupid things that keep Mario 64 still like somewhat relevant in today. Interesting bug, we don't talk about that one. I think that we should probably be a bit less dark on the ambient color because the wings sometimes just turn freaking black. There might be a bug with the wings that makes the color like that, but I agree they should not just be black. But like the rest of the game looks so good though. I don't think it's worth it just changing it just for the wings. Make lightning hit Mario, it's just like God doesn't want Mario to go there. I think we should probably be a bit less dark on the ambient color because the wings... Wait, you already read that. So which one of these is a good one? 64DS? Surely the 64DS one is going to be good. Do you want to just make it darker though? Yep, I like that though. I don't know if we still want to, we can still tune it, but like right now I'm feeling fine with it. We'll have to see how it actually looks like when all the lighting is baked. I'm not going with lighting, I think it's easier to just have an invisible wall. Are you gonna reason that there's lighting happening? Like, you wanna add a text box explaining some random lore like that? I think that's weird. I don't know. I like the flower, but I like the textures here. I'm just gonna make my own flower, fuck this, that's not worth it. Do you want me to make a flower? Nope. Are you just gonna 3D model it? Yep, it has to be a 3D model. Bye bye Lila. Bye. Just gonna be like this. Maybe that's a decent flower. Oh boy, what a folder. What beautiful textures we have in here. Hello Retro Koopa Troopa. Yeah, this is basically a Mario 64 sequel. I can... I'll just show you real quick what we're doing here. So this runs on the real Nintendo 64, obviously this is an emulator, but this can run on a Nintendo 64. So right now we're making this oil rig level, where you just mess with Bowser's minions. You destroy their plans to like build Bowser's base here. And these are like things you can do. And that's the 11th course, we have like 10 of these already done. This is the first one, just a simple beginner level. There's some tutorials in here for the new movements that we added. And this uses some super optimized engine that runs on the N64 that I made. Wee. Same mushroom hills from Sonic and Knuckles? What? I never played Sonic and Knuckles though. That is purely coincidental. I am innocent. Did I fix the song donations? Shit, I'll make a note. I'll make a note, fix song donations. I'll try it again. So I completely dislike 2D games and I used to love Sonic 1 and 2 when I was a kid. I had those two games. But I tried playing them as an adult because I never beat them as a kid. And I just realized how fucking terrible they are. And I imagine Sonic 3 and Knuckles is gonna be similar. For me at least. It's one of the best 2D platformers. Well, I haven't seen a good 2D platformer yet. Like there isn't a single one that I like. I think you just don't like 2D platformers, period. Maybe. Maybe they're all bad. We tried playing Hollow Knight for about five minutes and hated it. I didn't play it for five minutes. You played it enough for enough time. No, no, no. I watched the intro cutscene and then I touched the control stick and I instantly stopped playing the game because the control stick was an emulated d-pad. I decided this is not worth it. You could just use the d-pad then. Why would I want to play a game on a fucking d-pad? Are we in 1990? The control stick was invented in 1995. It's been 30 years. Are better played on a d-pad?  I'd never play a 2D platformer with a control stick. That's painful. Nope. Hi, Betta. How many segments does Wiggler have? I mean fighting games are a little bit easier to play with a control stick. He has four segments. Perfect. Now we just need the legs. I think every one of the animations is done except for the penguin's idle. Yeah. Yeah, he does need an idle animation. Yeah. But it doesn't need to be anything fancy. No, it doesn't have to be anything too fancy. I mean he's just standing around, right? Yeah. He does flap his fins in the original. Oh, right. Okay, I see. Are there going to be any big penguins in the game? No, but still, that fin flapping is very cute and should be in there. Yeah, I like that. What? How could she say something like that? How could Struggle say that about her dear viewers? What? Schlechter Morgen. Schlechter Morgen. Why am I adding two of these? What's wrong with me? I can just mirror this one. Schlechter Morgen rip. True. I'd rather debate about game controls than politics. Although I do like debating fucking politics. But it's because I love arguing.  I think this is going to be his feat. Okay. I think this looks pretty good for his feat. What do you think? Looks good. We have a whittler in the level now. Yep. What are those? It's shoes. Yeah, he definitely needs to look like he's actually working on an oil rig here. So having metal shoes wouldn't work. What does an oil rig worker look like? They probably have steel-toed boots. Or rubber boots too. Rubber boots? Something like those. Do these look like rubber boots? No, you should probably make the cuff of them a little bit bigger. A little bit longer? Like the top part?  Like that? A little bit, yeah. Yeah, I think that would look good. Maybe give him a different color? Or just like a shinier texture? Yeah. Or a dirtier texture. They're probably covered in dirt and grime. You may want to make the head the same size as the segments. Is that how whittlers look like? I thought the head was supposed to be bigger. Oh, it's because there was a baby whittler. It's because I made this out of a baby whittler, who does have a bigger head. So yeah, I agree. The head needs to be the same size. There we go. This is his boot's texture. I will make them kind of brownish, I think. Oh. One second, this might be important. Nevermind, it's just my phone bugging out. Is that a weakline? Yes. Wait, Crispy Toast? Who are you? Why is your name like that? Do I know you? What is going on? Why is this man's name highlighted? This weakline will be part of the all rig workers here. It just means that he's a verified account. Wow, you get a special highlight for being verified? Damn. Oh, he's famous. I thought it was someone I added as a moderator and forgot about. I think it would be really funny if I gave him a head for every single one of his segments. Because he spells as top guy and weaklines can be heard everywhere. And then the flower grows on top of the top one. What? Looks like the nose is the same material as this. Like that? I'm not adding the head to his feet. Interesting idea, but no. What? What the fuck? Is this still Mermaid? What? Huh? Uh. Are we just putting helmets on him? Yes. The ones on his back should be a little tinier. I think that would be kind of funny. I mean, I can do that too. I was just going to rotate them all in different directions. No, just make them a little bit tinier and then rotate them. I think the idea of him having tiny hats on his back is really funny. Yeah, that's why I wanted this. God, he's like a thousand triangles now though. Hey, we're not here to judge what Bowser wastes his money on. He can do what he wants. Yeah, but a thousand triangles is too much. Can't waste my polygon budget like that. Let's burn another line for Bowser. 876. 846. 844. I mean, 240 polygons is just the hats. I think that's just too much. I think we can't do this. I'm going to build more tanks in the weakness segments because that looks awful. Can I get away with making them three segments instead of four? I don't think so. No, every single weakness segment  is four segments of five. I think I'm going to have to say no to his flower because he's wearing a hat now. I mean, we can reason it like that but really it's because of the polygon budget. Okay. Oh, the helmets have an inside, I see. Well, we won't need that. Alright, 760, that is still a ton. Goddamn. That looks so much worse, for so little benefit. What if he made his whole leg just a boot? But that still looks fine, let me check. I think that works, considering he's working on the all-rec. Not being able to list all the red cheeks, true, true. He does still have the squiggly cheeks. He could get rid of the rim here. I think it looked fine for his body parts. 675, I think it's only becoming worse. Oh, that's better. I don't like games being handholdy, it's slowing me down. 671, I think if we make his drawing distance small enough, this should be fine. Am I gonna have another thing to animate? He will be something to animate. He's gonna be very tricky. Yep, he's gonna be probably the most difficult one to animate yet. Sorry? He's gonna be the most difficult one to animate yet. I thought Bowser was difficult enough, this is gonna be even worse. Yeah, he's gonna have so many bones too. Either way, I think we're done for today. We got the glass done, now we just need this guy done and the first star will be finished. Finally, after all this time. I am excited for that. Anyway, that means I'll see you guys on next Saturday. I have a lot of shit to do this week, so I gotta head out. I'll see you guys soon, bye bye.
