Hello.  Hello. Anybody home. Hello. Yes, you're first. Hello, the perfect Mario 64. Hello, minus Mario. Wait, what is this, this is course 14. It's 13. It's not 100% done, but I'm just waiting for Zeina to finish some stuff because 13 is mostly done now. Hello blinks. Oh my god, I look so more defined now that I've been in the sun for so much. Holy shit. Yeah, the crayons look nice. You got 10th and September. Yeah, I had to work in the yard so much. What's up? I like the look of this map. I'm a fan too. This is such a cool idea. Hello, Mr. Cat. What is the theme of this course? This is the craft level. It's made out of craft materials, the whole thing. I still need a funny crayon brand name. I was thinking Craytendo would be good. Zeina was saying Koopa colors, but I think that might be a bit too long. Are any stories planned for this course? Um, not quite. This course is going to be very simple and all the NPCs in this are going to be very robotic. And like, they're not real people. So we can't really make a story with it. Artendo. That's kind of good. Bebus. How does that fit the crayon? Adaptive lighting. On theDAWEI have a potential Raid Shadow Legends sponsorship coming. And I'm thinking that's when I release the all visible walls of Mario 64 video. It would just be me talking about raid Shadow Legends for a minute and then showing every visible wall in Mario 64 for them hours. That would be the funniest thing ever. This is not based on Yoshi's Crafted World, but it's a very similar theming, I think. OSTs for today. What do we want to pick? Sonic Adventure 2? I'm kind of feeling like it. Ace Wii? Sure. So I like the crayons here. One star I have planned is that there will be a piece of paper on the floor and there will be ice drawn on it. And there will be a doodle of Luigi standing next to the piece of paper. And he will be like, man, if only I had a yellow crayon, I could draw a star. So you bring him a yellow crayon, you carry it like this, and while you walk on the paper, you draw on the paper. So you draw a star on the paper and you get a star for it. I don't get it. Hello, X-Links. Did you see the new video today? You liked it? This video is doing really well on YouTube already.  Right now I'm just trying to produce a bunch of assets. That fit the aesthetic. One element I was thinking here is a confetti blizzard. Many people make stars differently. Will there be a trace? Yeah, I think I'm going to make a trace outline there. Just so it's easier to tell what you're supposed to do. And you just have to draw over the outline. Cray-Rom? No, we need a pun. Draw more EG. Plastic cups. I'm sure you could run Linux on N64. I don't see why not. Let's find a good plastic cup. Yeah, something like this. The most basic-ass plastic cup ever. Coloring book? Oh, a coloring book could work. Did you set a limit on the ROM size? Yes, 64 MB. I'm working on getting an outline of the level. Basically, I'm going to make a very basic version of this level. And then we're going to add to it. It just already looks decent, because it's somewhat UV mapped. Cross13 would have been fine too, if you guys weren't losing your shit over it the whole time. Nice silver. I also didn't show you guys this yet, but let me show you. Cross13 done. The outside area still needs some work, but Zeina's working on that. But yes, it's only one area. Let me show you what I did here. I did a lot of off-stream work. Wrong level. This is a little bit better, isn't it? Compared to last time you saw it. I had Zeina test it, and she managed to move pretty well with these physics. So I'm pretty confident that this is somewhat intuitive. Don't forget room for Egg. Egg will fit. Do not worry. I love the clouds. I like the clouds a lot too. I have no idea how well this runs on N64. Let's test it. I imagine the framerate might not be great. Yes, this is Mario 64. I want at least 30 FPS. We're in the 50s. No, we're still in the 30s. There looks to be some sort of shading bug though. 25 there. I can very easily increase the FPS by just reducing the amount of clouds. That would be no issue at all. This is really hard because of the input lag only. It works though. And the clouds pop in too much. Are you all playing a prank on me when you say you like the clouds? Are they that bad? You don't like them? If I want to reduce the clouds, I can just set this to 0.5. The player is free to just dodge them. I'm fine with that. They look like an untacted model. I also finished most of the main area now. Let me show you that as well. This looks decent now, doesn't it? I see everything. It's probably gonna get a lot better once Biobak gets a sense on this. There's one section here that I think is like the coolest section ever. Let me show you. The movement in this is genuinely so fun. And this is the coolest thing ever. You fight Mirror Mario by kicking up here. Isn't that cool? The real name is Alberta. What's your social insurance number? Start perfect mechanic on the ground pound if you press B. After pressing A it sparkles. Ground pound spin jump. This one here? Yeah, if you press A frame perfectly there sparkles. Although frame perfectly here is very generous. You have like a five frame window. You just need to press fast enough and that's the difficulty. Right, if I press slower I just get in all the dust. But it's pretty relaxed actually. I found an awesome new use for AI models recently. And that is negotiating with Raid Shadow Legends. Look at this man. Hi Rachel and blah blah blah blah blah blah. I didn't even read this. I just said send. Again, I didn't even read this. I just said send. Hopefully it works out. All right, back to this. Course 14 we're making assets. Next I want a plastic house. Like this. Should be easy enough. I legit just went to chat GPT and told it make me as much money as possible. And it just spat out that text and I just sent that to Raid Shadow Legends. Hello Raid Shadow Legends. There's an AI thing going on. I cannot sponsor. The paperwork from Peach's memory. True. I was thinking of that too when I made this. The paperwork from Peach's memory is kind of nice. It's just. It's just not very well made. But like the idea is really cool. No, no, my sponsored video for Raid Shadow Legends. What I think it should be is the first minute is me talking about Pen and Coke's every invisible wall video. Then there's going to be a minute of Raid Shadow Legends. Me telling the people how great the game is. And then there's just four hours uninterrupted every visible wall in Super Mario 64. Sponsored from an Israeli company given what's happening. But it's four hours of every visible wall of Super Mario 64. They're going to get the worst sponsored video ever. I also didn't know they were Israeli sponsored. Generally, I never take sponsorships unless I can think of a way to like fuck them over. Just in general, I think ads are like not a good thing for anyone. So typically I do not take any sponsorships unless it's like, you know, something I actually think has some merit to it. Like Brilliant, I thought maybe had some merit to it for some people. But if it's Raid, I definitely will just fuck with them. Super Mario 64 is garbage, ugly, unreasonable, piece of shit game. Speaking of which, this video is sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends. Oh, but they would not give me the green light for that. I've never gone through with an ad. Like you never bought what they were advertising or you never took an ad. Like sponsorship. How did you create custom enemies in Mario 64 Lost Impact without an e-comp? Assembly. It's a print crunch. Yep. You guys see how wrong I've gotten. I spent so much time outside this week and I hated it. I was my my parents were over for 10 days and my dad loves working. So basically the entire 10 days I was just doomed to do yard work. See for me, OK, by the way, I do something similar. If I see a product that was advertised to me before somewhere, I mentally think, hey, they paid money to advertise this. Meaning the money that went into advertising is part of this product's price. I'm being surcharged to be bothered by them. And I definitely don't want to pay for that. Can you tell us all the stars from Course 14? I can. Do you guys want to hear my ideas for Course 14? All right. Here's the idea. First star. There is a Yoshi doodle and a bunch of squirrels squirrel. OK, let me show you what a squirrel is. Since this is all made out of craft material. This is going to be a squirrel. And the squirrel is going to be a squid. The squirrels are eating the Yoshi's apples. So there's just a doodle of Yoshi going. These squirrels are eating my apples. Go help me out. Right. Very basic. Second star. A toad doodle. He is sitting on a mountain somewhere and you have to go get him. He just gifts you the star. Third star. There's a Luigi doodle and there's a piece of paper in front of him. On this piece of paper, there's two eyes drawn. And he says, if only I had a yellow crayon, I could draw a star and we would be happy or something like that. So you have to go find a yellow crayon, carry it there and draw the star. Star four. You see these big cardboard boxes in the background here. One of these cardboard boxes is going to have like an opening and you can go inside. There's a platforming section there. Star five. There is. Let me find this toy. Weasel ball toy. This. There's this toy here along a bunch of cardboard trees. And it's guarding a red coin area. And then the 8-bit pipe to Mario paint. That's the idea. These companies wouldn't spend money on it if it didn't work. Yeah, advertisement definitely does work. Even if an advertisement doesn't make you go. Oh, I want to buy this. Even then, there is still an effect of. You've heard of this company and now there's familiarity with it. And you will just intrinsically assume it is higher quality or more expensive or better in a way. So I'm going to be drawing doodle base. Sounds boring. Why not? No, this is all like a craft. Like someone just built this out of shit they found in the house. Paper cutouts and doodles are the same thing. Are they not? Any new optimizations to the engine? There's new optimizations constantly. Just recently we imported F3DX3. Do you have albumations in your Discord DMs? That's me. Possibly. Why? Do I need to respond? What's in it for me? I really love Yoshi's Crafted World. Did they hate it? Did they hate Yoshi's Crafted World? We finished the Wild Level months ago. Nobody liked Crafted World? Oh, come on. Can I maybe find like a plastic up on one of these swords? Drink water? I drink water. If you do it on paper and cut it out it's paper cut out otherwise it's not the same. Well yes obviously they would be cut out. You can make it in three clicks. The texture is the problem. I want this kind of texture here. So I need the frills and I have a few things that kind of look like the frills but nothing that I feel confident I can make the texture out of. Like maybe the middle part of this. I don't look at my DMs. I get a lot of them. There is just no way for me to feasibly look at all of them. Paper lanterns. This could work. Why do you eject to pour water and screw? Is there other lanterns here? Dude this texture is exactly what I'm looking for. No way. Damn bro that's crazy. I think I have to make it out of this part though. This part let me just change the color. This is not looking how I want it to look. I could do a simpler paper thing. Let's try this. I do have a repo for it but it's private. And I don't share it. I only share my texture repo with people if in return they send me a full rip of a different game that I don't have yet. I think this makes for a good paper cup. Like so maybe. I'm currently making course 13, 15. Yeah a full set of textures from a game that I don't have yet. That's the trade I offer. There we go. What do you think of my plastic cup? No! Do something useful. With all your current skills on Yen Singh do you think you'll be able to release a new 100% original game on Yen Singh 64? Yeah definitely. I mean I don't know everything I need to know for that but I'm sure anything that's missing I could figure out pretty quickly. I like the little shine it has but something about this is not perfect yet. I have an idea. This is a little expensive technique wise but I think this could look really cool. You said you knew you should offload to the CPU when you can. What kind of things can be offloaded? Well the example I gave the sine and cosine function. That's a very good thing to offload to the CPU. Oh and that looks kind of nice doesn't it? Reflective cup. Gives it a little bit of a plasticky look. I can get these cups in different colors too. Can I ruin the effect of the ridges? A little bit. It'd be better if the ridges weren't like this. You're right. The thing is okay there is a way to make the ridges matter. And that is if you multiply and add the textures. Hold your bar. Just remove the ridges entirely. I don't know what I would put then. Make a normal map? Sure. I'll just add that to the microcodes. I'm gonna just give this a quick vibe check. I know I'm not going to lie. Okay this man will tell the truth in the next few sentences. The back graphics especially in high resolution kind of feel more like Dreamcast or Windows 98 graphics. I probably know since I picked it up. The back graphics. Oh this hex graphics. I mean Dreamcast is a lot more advanced than N64 right? Wouldn't that be a good thing? I have not played Eclipse. I actually generally just hate Mario Sunshine. So I was really looking for hacks for Mario Sunshine. But I would probably hate Eclipse less than the vanilla Mario Sunshine game. They will still be modified. But they are preliminarily done. Except for one area of course, 13. That was not even preliminarily done. We still need a funny crayon brand. Craytendo so far is the best one to me. Koopa Colors is number 2. But the name is so long that it's not gonna look good on texture. On the 8th Sunshine is sent to me.  Have you played Mario Sunshine? Come on, come on bro. Oh yeah, Artendo is also a strong contender.  These types of pins. If you wanna click an easy way to know if a game is good or not. Is ask Kaze's opinion and reverse it. Potla, that's a funny one. The crayons are pretty low poly. Marion? No. Koopa's Colorful Crayons. Way too long of a name. Also that abbreviates to KKK. Mario Sunshine is a game that you can love. But that will never love you. For me the reason I hate Mario Sunshine. Is actually different from most people. The blue coins are stupid. Yes, that is a problem. Yes, you can only kinda any percent the game. Because if you wanna represent the game. You're gonna lose your mind. But what really bothers me. In Mario Sunshine. Is. When you do anything. You always get interrupted by fucking cutscenes. You can't go 5 meters in that game. Without the game being like. Nope, go watch this cutscene. Joe, thank you for the 10 USD. I always love catching streams and watching your YouTube vids. They've been getting really good lately. Thank you, thank you. I'm gonna try to produce a lot more YouTube content soon. So hopefully you will enjoy that too. That's a new one, yeah. That is pretty new. Is this Pokemon Shiny hunting or something? What is this? Koopa's Tail. Oh. Koopa's Tail. Yes, that's good. Koopa's Tail.         That's bad. So yeah. Why is this an issue right now? I don't understand. Maybe I just can't use springs for some reason. It's a skill issue. How can I start modding SMZero? Like courses and stuff? There's a pretty good tutorial. Pinned in the SimpleFlips Discord. RomShack channel. Roan Roasted him. Oh, that's nice. Can SimpleFlips write code? I mean, I don't know. I don't think he's ever done anything that would require writing code. There's also no evidence to suggest he can't do it. Do you think Henry Cavill can program?  You have no reason to think he can't. What did I do? Can SimpleFlips hextest on the interplane? I hope so. Can SimpleFlips rotate a cow in his mind? I have too many stupid ideas. I have to contain myself. How was your guys' 9-11? Recently I had a weird thought that has no base in reality. As I don't know if anyone actually doing that. But just to mention that someone took one of your old hacks and functionally rebuilt it. Yeah, that could be fun. Do you use any form of assembly for tomorrow's hacking? No, I still use assembly sometimes. I use it for really optimized stuff. What do you think of these compared to my 64 folder? Let's see. Oh, they are nice. These are nice. Yeah, I like these a lot. Oh, that's nice. Yes, we should do these. Oh, another Red Bull Guru bringing Henry Cavill. Wait, what? Henry Cavill is a Red Bull Guru? Or associated with Red Bull Gurus? You were expelled from preschool on September 11th. Damn, bro. What did you do? Oh, that's a nice pin. Do you use GCS extended in NESM? I'm not sure if I do. Okay. Do you like N64 filtering? I like the N64 filtering. I know it makes everything wishy-washy, but it doesn't bother me. This is such a nice looking pin. It's just gonna be so difficult to platform on this. That's my one worry with this. And I can't really make it too big, because it's gonna be obvious that it's too small. Maybe I can make it like twice the size. Without anyone complaining that the size is unrealistic. Are you supposed to platform on those? Well, we might make these platformable, yeah. Do you think any non-celebs know about your mods? Yeah, definitely. Red Piltup number 47. Living with a woman is gay. Build up your community with high-value bros and sleep in the same bed as them.  That's a hot take. You know what I'm missing? I'm not multiplying this with shade. Rearmament will increase a little, but so far main area has 400 fewer polis and a shit ton of materials and overall removed. What? How the fuck did he kill 400 polygons? Don't shit yourself in the boss fight area, dude. This will be the craziest demo of 2024. Removed the trees around the area. Oh. Do you not want those? Or do you have like a better replacement? Or is it just lower poly? Because now that you mentioned that, I don't think I put a lot of effort into making those low poly. So yeah, that's probably a very good thing to do. Oh my God, do you see how HD this looks? You have a better replacement? Oh, hello, SM64Dude. Dude, the new video is doing so well. Life is good today. Prototypes, I presume? Yeah, definitely, dude. We're just putting a long cylinder with a circle on top. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I think we should put these trees in the level. I think this is peak. I don't think C1 demo will be in September. Yeah, the algorithm is so obsessed with the problem with the grass video. It's hilarious. It should look like a sea urchin also be badly textured. We should just put a texture of leaves on the floor on the tree and that will fix it. This is where you turn yourself into the tree I just painted, yeah. I was one of you guys that auto-plays into the problem with the grass which is so perfect. Dude, I just knew the YouTube algorithm would love the grass video. If I look in my analytics, let's see. Yeah look at this, most successful videos, this one I just uploaded, this one I just Wait, this one's actually a banger and then it's just this one here. The problem with the grass in Mario 64. I need to make more videos like that. I could be so rich. How much time to make a 20 minute video? I probably spent like 20 hours on it and then someone else edited the whole thing. Alright, we need more materials. I was thinking books. We should put books here, but I'm not 100% sure I like the idea of books here. Did I tag it? What do you mean tag it? The video thumbnail is not clickbait.  There's a ruler right here. Upscaled N64 bookends. Nah, they look too bad. Books with fake titles. I'm just not sure I want books on here because books aren't really craft materials, but they are something you would make a fake Mario 64 level with as a kid. It's got the red arrow. Does it? Oh, it does. But that's not clickbait. It actually is about the grass. Very strong CPUs compared to the GPU, both have memory constraints, and both are very different ROMs. Well, okay, fun fact, actually, the N64 CPU no longer is strong compared to the GPU because once you actually optimize the memory throughput, the RSP became the bottleneck, at least on my end. So I no longer think the CPU is that much overpowered compared to the RSP. It's just you need to program the game really well to get there. And I haven't really programmed the RSP yet. So maybe actually the RSP will be a bottleneck again. But Sauraen is working on it right now, and he's probably going to come up with a lot of really cool things. It's not a kid's room. It's a course made out of craft materials. I would not make my own N64 game from scratch because I have no reason to. It would be more financially successful if I just made the game on Steam and then maybe like an N64 version of it, so like an advertisement that would work. Okay, books, let me think about books. No one's going to call it the craft and world level. Hello, RSphere, hello, everyone. Wait, there's a view analytics button here. I can see how many viewers I have. Never mind, I can't. Don't kids have Legos? Yeah, but I don't want to put Lego in here. Need ideas? No, I'm just thinking about whether a book would be a good idea or not. Kraftwerk? What's that? Of course, I know what a Kraftwerk is, but what is a Kraftwerk theme? Switch free and the N64? Stack up sticky notes. I'm just thinking about what can I do with a book, you know? I've given Biobak the day off. I mean, I don't employ Biobak, technically speaking. We need vine swinging on threads attached to these pins. That could work. Oh, I can definitely add a string to this and then you hang on the string. I like that. String hanging thread thingy. I told Biobak he can take the day off if he wants to never see his family again and die. And somehow he just didn't do it. Letter magnet that you have to push the right star. I think that's too puzzly, too puzzly. The crayon drawing was already pretty much on the edge. This is too much puzzle. Kraftwerk was a German electronic music group. Stabler trampoline. Definitely possible. There's already a trampoline idea somewhere here. What's it? Rubber band. I also have the idea of a paper airplane that you can ride. Serena and Rty Quiz 1 coming out soon. Well, Biobak is currently working on it. And after that, I'm going to get a demo ready of just the first course. So hopefully I can do that soon. Maybe in the next two months, hopefully. Will Mario break a dog's neck like an origami king? No. Does he do that in origami king? I don't remember this part of the game. I'll finish just this row, Mike. 85 maybe. Yeah, this is course 14. Course 15 actually has all the platforms already done. I just need to actually import them and make it a level. So the last two courses will be a lot faster, I think. But then there's also the bowser level and the side levels. So I'm still going to work on it in six or seven months when this is done. That's a good question. I'll probably make a bunch of videos after this is done and work on my own game. As soon as I insert a dog, I need to feed it by snapping it in half backwards like I'm breaking its fucking jaw. That's actually so funny that all the bosses in origami king is just office supplies. You make a submission like if you take them as you program them. You're already almost done. That's nice. I hate this section. All roads lead to becoming a YouTuber. Yeah, being more of a YouTuber is probably my best way to make more money. And it's also good PR for when I'm actually make my game and do the stuff I want to do. My advice to get people getting into game development is always make as many games as possible as fast as possible. So you learn because your first 100 games or so are just going to suck ass. Maybe your first 12. Maybe that's a more fair assessment. So just get all of the suckage out immediately. I was thinking what if I become most critical but for Nintendo 64 news, you know what I mean? I'll just look at anything that's new with Nintendo 64 stuff. I give the most basic fucking bland most agreeable take possible and I just say it. And then maybe I'll just chat GPT generate a few most critical jokes. Let me see if I can do that. Generate me five most critical style jokes about Nintendo 64 games. Super Mario 64 absolute classic, but let's be real. Mario's had us more personality than half the NPCs. The guy's pulling triple flips of mountains like he's auditioning for Ninja Warrior. But as soon as you land a perfect jump like in those cameras, like let's show you the floor in HT. More OT humor. Ocarina of Time is epic dungeons, but you can't tell me Link wasn't dropping a Deku nut or two in his tunic during the water temple. Dude's changing the water level so much. You just know he's trying to flush whatever disasters he's got floating in there. Hero of Time more like hero of too much fiber. What is this? It's not good at generating most critical bits. AVGNS joke. It did what you asked, true. Just didn't do a good job at it. That was spot on, you're gonna agree? You think that's what most critical jokes are like? I don't think changing videos is allowed to say most critical jokes, that might be the issue. It nailed the syntax and structure. That's true. It's just missing the peepee poopoo in there. I mean there was a bit of poopoo in there, but not enough peepee, you know what I mean? Wherever you want Braum, you can just program them. I'm gonna attempt to do that. We'll add it in the poopoo, but in the jokes we need more peepee. Let's dial up the peepee humor a bit. I'm gonna do it. You can't just so seriously say that. It's missing the hangable flag. What I'm doing is severe abuse, I hope not. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. So you have to use realtime animation, that must mean you have to use realtime remote for testing, right? How do you handle that? What do you use? I have a summer card and I can just press a button. It is not relevant enough to be a token, I'm afraid. It doesn't have a single Biobak neuron in there. I don't think I'm putting cereal boxes here. This is not supposed to be like a challenge level, this is just supposed to be a craft level. We don't want this to be like something a kid would make. We want this to be something someone who crafted something would make. When you're trying to pitch AI being put in charge of shit or whatever, it's a name, it's a good idea. And it's like, fuck no, I'm a language machine, what are you talking about? True. You should craft a better level. Thank you, Mr. Comet. I'm still not sure if I want books in this level or not. What are the pros and cons of books? Books don't really feel like craft material. You know what, I'm saying no one books. Fake trees. Yes, cardboard trees. Paper Mario tree. Unfortunately, Paper Mario Color Splash does look pretty good. Oh, and the book's only for the funny titles. That's a good point, yes. I want to check, um, how good ChenGBT01 is. I might make a case clips video, just like me talking to ChenGBT01 and trying to get it to optimize my graph runner code. See if it can find the single optimization. There's actually one thing I need to ask it, and that is why Michi's code didn't work. I want to see if it can figure that out, because that's really difficult to figure out. I'm thinking of asking the AI task manager if job negotiation is being used effectively. I'm being like, absolutely not, I'm so bad at this. Well, it is negotiating with Rage Shadow Legends for me. So there's that. It's doing a better job than I would. I definitely can do that, but there isn't really a reason to do that. At no point in my life have I looked at a Mario game and thought, man, what this game really needs is a functioning calculator. Putting that in there was pure just flex. No, I don't own a dev kit. Consuming a game turn complete computer and RTYI, Probably wait what a computer is turned to be? I don't think that's a property of the property language.  I'm having a sort of math degree now. I wish I could get my hands on the trees. I can't do anything else. In fact, I didn't want the game to be fun. I wanted everything to be interesting. I think that was my primary goal. That shows in some parts of the game. No, my education is in math, not programming. Same thing really. No, math is way more difficult than programming. But also way more mathematical. More mathematical ask a programmer they'll tell you the same thing study both math and computer science and math is way harder yeah exactly my math degree had applications in it and that's about it maybe i will just make like green cardboard like this that should be good i think can i ask a question you just did bro you just asked a question which means yes it is possible that you can ask a question hello xpm let me run back that hot tank before i even say it oh new email news from case emmanuel on odyssey say can i ask another question next can i post an answer in the same room i don't know if you can do that what is cool you could do that i'm not saying you should but it's impressively good oh yeah charisma i tried more to be a game and um to be honest the programming and charisma even if it was an assembly would be a lot less impressive than the one in last impact but it might be more fun as a game it's probably less frustrating it's less really bizarre decisions but when i made last impact really my thought was never can i make this fun it was always just i have an idea i'll put it in like i didn't even double think double check if it was a good idea i just put the idea in when i had the idea i was like yeah you're not arguing you're just gonna do it i think back then my mindset was so much like i don't want to be some lazy dude who doesn't put the things he wanted this game in so i'm just gonna put the thing in as soon as i think about it without even double checking anything just because i didn't want to be lazy you know and that resulted in a lot of the game being the way it is i want you to go to the unchanged play mods i don't know a difficult question do you mean you never even considered putting goomba pit on last impact i don't think i considered that now i had gotten all the goomba pit i wanted out of my system with sm64 madness so i was really happy except i'm struggling because you know hate the doors especially they can't kill you from the head anymore yeah making boggies not killable from the head was definitely one of the decisions what do you think of my cardboard tree it's a cardboard tree it's gonna look like this what do you want it to look like huh um heck hello more another what happens if you run into the lock i'm sure there's a tree like this in one star revenge just this one's cardboard i can't read every comment guys very sorry okay what did i mean by cardboard bridge unironically yes they do sometimes why i'm like that's crazy so i definitely have a cardboard bridge here this would look cool true but you can't platform on this a bridge that would unroll oh i see what you mean that sucks moritz but there's a button to undo it it's cinematic mode um a rolled up cardboard bridge it's doable with um an armature and a lot of math but i don't think i want to obstacle handle bridges let me see that oh interesting interesting can we do a low poly version of this tape measure yeah tape measure is also a good one this is artists for the level layout um i want to make a few of these assets and then i'm gonna do an art test basically although i think the art is definitely gonna work right yeah that's definitely true Biobak although i think the pins here the pins look so good the pins are peak and this cardboard side i like it too is there anything else in this paper mario game that looks inspiring nah this is all origami wait ah he's burnt it looks different in game hmm you see some wooly what so hmm i don't know the sound looks like it's wool right i am favorite adult here wait you finally turned 18 lila mine there's an idea what if there were paint palettes or buckets and it falls in she was registering for a while to be that color oh that sounds like a good opportunity oh shit lila happy birthday wait happy birthday to you happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday lila happy birthday this is perfect to you happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday lila all right it's over i'm not singing no shot let me actually look hard for bridge maybe i can find something else oh Biobak i have exactly that planned it's already written down um googly eyes the ones i have planned is all the world's fortress enemies so like thwomps i'm gonna give them physics too imagine the thwomp going down with the googly eyes just going crazy all over the place it's so peak we use popsicle stick the problem with the popsicle sticks is so high poly unless i can make a low poly version of it somehow maybe there's like a simpler variant of it um craft supplies isn't that what we did last time wall buttons stuff like that sure the n6 was a polygon pushing beast but we still can't have that many polygons we are still very limited i'm not sold on this i would like to make something that's really long and like a cutout i'm not sure if i want that maybe maybe just for this level it's worth it so we could have a really long platform where it's like zigzag cutouts and this really is going to become the brodude level so this isn't the best thing about this i don't have to uv map this shit because like that's just realistically what it would look like so fuck dude this new blender feature is so shit that has to be a bug how is that a feature green painted newsprint and this is a fan cam of it on tiktok post it on brother's videos like when you're telling shit about that start complaining about the looping time system change your mind what yeah this actually works doesn't it this works we can make platforms like this and no one's gonna hate on it oh because it's cardboard someone just went across this with a scissor and it looks like the potatoes when i peel them instead of my mom oh wait he got upset oh and you because he thought you were like a hater but you posted something nice is that what happened oh that's true it is pretty sturdy but like mario's very light he's like a fly that's weird i didn't think brody was someone to get upset like that um putting capital at an angle um what we could do is have something similar to this and then have like a tilting bridge gaudy what is gaudy gaudy extravagantly bright or showy typically so to be as tasteless uh-huh okay but you know what i'm thinking here toothpicks on two sides and cardboard in the middle and then it's like the tilting s-shaped platform oh oh he saw your playthrough and that's how he knew you were talking shit i see so well i guess there's a factor to it that's like he makes the games for like the super nerds and it's kind of like an echo chamber and the paradigms they have for what they like enjoy in the hack are very different from like like other people would enjoy in the hack so there's like a little bit of an echo chamber to it and it would seem like people outside the community would like unfairly judge him or something like that i don't know so dude six out of eight rats is the craziest thing to me that definitely is an echo chamber that okay the weird okay this is a weird rant but like six out of eight rats is like geek mental illness it's like i must play mario 64 hacks and i am miserable when i play them but there is this patch that makes it slightly less miserable for me but i hate doing it that's like what why else would you want six out of eight rats right and also the Factor of like I must put red coins in my level because I need eight eight stars and six seven stars in my level and the red coins are just such a cheap way to do them without actually being creative I can just fucking put them across the level 80 coins does this piss as well yeah exactly all right that sounds really divisive I think it's charming it looks really good when it works now okay drama I don't think it's drama Yoshi's Crafted World no it's just a level made out of craft materials I think I prefer Koopa stealth or Koopa style does the song say Eggman over Nova can you like couple origami strips with curve folds some simple ones to be feasible paper grid maybe origami is kind of too different of a style than what I'm going for it's not something I would be able to craft hi what was that oh thank you for the two months Honda hex coat so I realized I'm the oldest mission that should be different in super sweet sugar land when you are on the roller coaster and you have to dodge the flying balls with the wings on that that mission needs to be completely different sunshine style time rats aren't that bad they can be absolutely fun if your movements fun MRIs movement is fun didn't serene fusion do that but with blues those are good missions the reason they don't want a so they play a major scale and land on the one you didn't last no it's off it just lands on the six and satisfied yeah but that's not the terms that people that make these games think about it right they think about games not in terms of the feeling the player experiences they think of games in terms of the mechanics you interact with and whether running through those mechanics is fun itself without any of the visual and audio sugar on top right where's people that normally play games they really are in it for the visual and audio sugar because if you complete it 13 pretty much okay so what I'm gonna do here is this is gonna be a tilting platform and that's gonna be really cool to walk past I think do you mean they cannot pass around the tooth pinpoint when Mario was cross that's exactly what the plan is lucky that's what I put the toothpicks there for so it makes sense that it spins I'm probably gonna have it slightly rotated by default so that the player knows before they step on it or at least they have a hint before they step on it so it looks pretty linear mr. comet we have we have five assets right now we don't have a level right now I'm just making assets and then I'm gonna arrange them into level shape the skybox is bad really the overworld is kinda planned out in that we want this to be Yoshi's fruit islands and you explore deeper and deeper into the island as you go there's gonna be things that we already have planned for the overworld but there's no concrete drawing or anything like that Zeina was already doing like sketches though she wanted to make the overworld okay my notes say string hang grip thingy what could I have meant by that string hang grip thingy look at your past stream no you like the Internet Explorer 8 and 9 what is blood talking about I think it's squirming squirming no string hang grip no way it might have been this thing here gooey rubber string hands what is a gooey rubber string hand this no I don't think so I'm just gonna remove this I think this makes no sense cardboard mountains that's gonna be cool yeah the entire level is made out of cardboard basically you can let your children play in asbestos Mr. Comet mine are not allowed I actually used to think family guy was funny when I was younger my blonder years so how do we texture this is the question I can definitely just put cardboard at front but that would look bad right we need to still look like it's painted I became a father seven weeks and six days ago I have a small daughter now her name is Reina oh yeah pipe cleaners are definitely planned I think I want to make like enemies out of pipe cleaner hello Miguelito sure Freddy who plays as poor Grandpa bear Picked up 13 when every day I would watch an entire season of Family Guy while scrolling reddit memes. And reddit memes weren't around when you were 13. There was no AI that could have made those reddit memes. The problem with all these mountains here is they are painted and I don't know how to do the paint here texture-wise. Do we do it with a decal? Oh like you were actually going on reddit and looking at the reddit posts. You didn't go to like tiktok and there was like subway service gameplay with reddit. Am I the asshole? I pooped on the floor. We're going on. Oh shit. Okay. You are a veteran. Yeah, I'm probably going to have to use a decal here. Born in 96, damn you are my age. I on purpose didn't project from you so that I could, uh, yeah. I need a different texture for this. Oh, okay. Thank you for the hint. Miguelito. Can you tell me next how to make a plane in blender? I still need to figure that one out. And then can you wipe my butt? Sorry, that was mean for no reason. What does he say? He just gives like the most, he basically gave me a blender tutorial for someone who You speak Python programmers. It doesn't matter which language you program in. They're all the same. More or less, but I don't respect anyone, any programmer, like by default, you have to actually be good. And then I will respect them. It doesn't matter which language you use. Fix on the tilting bar. We're a little misaligned. I think I wouldn't actually tell like that. Maybe it's just me. No, I'm going to have it to be slightly tilted by default, but they are perfectly aligned with each other. When games got into Python, probably because no one made a Python engine. I didn't expect any programmers to be so efficient. True. This was one idea on how I had to do it, but I think it would be looking a little better if we had just a small bit of cardboard shining through, like it's not perfectly painted. It's way too dark. I probably want the monster in a different color as well, right? Like, this is just not a good color. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, I've heard that Python performs slow a bunch of times and it makes sense because it's not a compiled language, but I was never sure how much of that is true and how much of that is just people memeing. Yeah, Canada is pretty nice, much better than Germany over here. Okay, I like the cardboard mountains, they can stay. To get rid of the solar flare here, that's making the level much more difficult to experience. Do we want a lamp up in the sky as the sun? As the source of light? I think that would go hard. Just like a ceiling lamp or like a desk lamp? I think a desk lamp would go best. Crayon Bridge feels kind of dangerous, it's slow. It's not even a real bridge, bro, they're just floating in the sky. That's fucked up, Kaze. Kaze, why are you just making them float in the sky? You know, Germany sucks to live in. It was listed as one of the best countries to live in until 2022, when it went down like 5 spots. Imagine doing the omen guessing with the chess, you could see that level on the table in the background for a second as the camera moves. That would be pretty sick. Oh yeah, these are the lamps I'm looking at. Genie of the Lamp? That's what he looked like in Mario Party 4? This console is truly way ahead of the Nintendo 64. Doing fine in Germany right now. I'm just glad I don't live there anymore. Way too many taxes, way too much bureaucratic bullshit. The people are all unfriendly. Yeah, I think a lamp like this, kinda. But if this is being built on a desk, the lamp should be on top, right? Like above it. Can I also send a text message? Sure, but it's way less than Germany. I mean, compared to the US, basically everyone has high taxes. Oh, that's pretty nice, Morris. If you can avoid it. I've been living in Canada for 3 years now, I'm still being haunted by German bureaucracy. Oh yeah, in the US, I imagine it's amazing if you have money and if you don't, you just kinda die. That was my impression of the US. Are you still fighting with German bureaucracy? Yeah, that's the thing. I like the desk lamp. Maybe it should be a bit to the side here. Most designs are less than 10 crayons long. Bro has the unit of measurement down. You have a 30 day skit on Schizoscrabble, that is insane dude. How? I don't think I've gotten one Schizoscrabble right so far. Do they do that sign to Herrscher? That sounds like they are running the government like an edgy Twitter social media brand account. 40% of your salary? I wish. Germany is more like 60. I think being schizophrenic helps with role making. Probably helps with creativity. They need more Sonic and Shadow stages in SA2, that would be great. I really wish Sonic Adventure 2 wasn't so jank. The game could be so amazing. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's 60. Maybe it's probably more than 60 actually. If you are making money. No, having a creative outlet is good. Then being said, I don't know very many completely healthy people in role making. Fair point. They are going down hard on pro-Palestine stuff in Germany. Most of the movements in Israel against Palestine are coming from either the US or Germany. Wait, what? Really? I have no idea. I don't know. Hmm. Funny how basically I'm learning all my politics just from you guys in Zwitschgat. This is also like the most civil place that I've ever seen politics being discussed. That's also true Hexa for sure. My motivation to get jacked. If you want a healthy mind, you kind of need a healthy body. So that was basically my motivation. I just wanted to make sure I'm physically fit so I can be mentally fit. Originally, I started working out because athletes have better reaction times and I was into competitive gaming. So I just kind of got jacked to my combat reaction time. See, I feel like that's cap. Why? What else do you think it would be? What other motivation do I have? Or did I have to start working out? Or do you just not think that you actually get better reaction time from being physically fit? There's good evidence on that. So action time. Okay, well, I'm not going to get a good number because it's probably like input lag and stuff. But let's see. Can I hit enter or something? Do I need to click left mouse? Yeah, we're just 273. 26. 178. That's pretty fucking good. 200. That sucks. 182. That's peak. Wait, what the fuck? How fast are we? There's no way someone can react in 100 milliseconds. That's not physically possible. Okay, friends, we got like 130 to 150. No way. It doesn't hit windows at like 20 milliseconds of input lag. Oh, that's a sick tech track, actually. Hmm. Well, you also might have input lag. You can't dodge a laser that moves at light speed. Do you actually believe you can dodge bullets faster than the bullets? Yeah. If there's a movie and in this movie, two people are fighting, but the fight they're having is very clear. They're obviously not trying to win. They're like not doing the optimal thing. They're not even going anywhere near the Nash equilibrium. They're like just doing random moves that look cool for the camera. Do you guys still enjoy that? Or do you look at that and be like, this is fucking bullshit. Just have this be over and tell me who won. Clearly, you're not interested in actually giving me a good fight scene. Because I'm the latter. I think a bit of both, Biobak. No, I can get my Canadian citizenship next year. Is it probably a bad movie or not? I was thinking this watching Star Wars for the first time. Oh, yeah, the fucking camera shake. Oh, my God. The camera shake in movies. Are in-camp babies a thing in Canada? I have never heard of this concept. It's not like you get a baby, so you are allowed to stay. I mean, I'm already a permanent resident, right? So I wouldn't need a baby to allow me to stay. Oh, that's a nice lamp. Canada is the first foreign country I went to. No, you need to stay three years in Canada as a permanent resident. But days you spend in Canada as not a permanent resident count half. So because I spent one year here before I became a permanent resident, I can take the citizenship test after three and a half years. And I got residency because I am married to a Canadian. Which is my wife. Should be this one, right? No, three, three. This one. And the light needs to come mostly from above, but not entirely. It needs to be a slight Z component to it. So square root of 112 multiplied by 12 plus 32 multiplied by 32 is 116. That's not good enough. 116 minus 116 maybe? 120 by 120? Oh. And then we do 45 by 45. What the hell? There we go. The citizenship test guy always tells you you failed the test at the end and you have to say sorry to the Canadian crew. Is the light coming from the lamp now or not? I can't tell. Yeah, I think there's stronger light on this side than this side. I don't take any maple syrup. Didn't I already add widescreen support for the HUD and then I just removed it again or something? Must be. Okay, level Rainbow Road. This is at 16331 and 8118. We now should have a lens flare coming from the lamp. So suddenly you can see a ceiling at the top and the lamp looking over. Yeah, that's kind of fun. This would look a lot better if I just export. Well, there's a few issues with widescreen support such as do you want to support it on emulator or on N64 because the widescreen modes are different. Dude, why is it being eaten by the black void? That makes no sense. I didn't even make a black void. There actually is not a background in this level. It's actually an emulator bug that we don't see the Hall of Mirrors effect here. Oh, I guess actually rendering at distance makes sense. What happened here? Did I hit merge by distance? I must have hit merge by distance. Okay, we don't bother with that.     We don't bother with the decal for now. No, I wanted to do one build that does both and then one more. Okay, my plan is we release version 1. Version 1 runs on emulator and N64. And then 1.1 also runs on N64 emulator. And then 1.2 is only N64. Because at that point we have enough emulator compatibility that we can just say, fuck it, we're making an N64 game. And emulators will then technologically have to catch up with the game. That's my plan, I think, for now. Either way, I think we're done for today. My parents are gonna leave today. I have to bring them to the airport in a minute. So I think I have to cancel the stream here. And I will see you guys in the next stream. I might stream tomorrow. Maybe. Don't know yet. But yeah. Bye bye.
