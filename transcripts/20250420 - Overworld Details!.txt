I don't know why, why Hello, can I enter my IP? I don't know why, why I don't know why, why I don't know why, why Tell me you love me I don't know why, why Tell me you love me I don't know why, why I don't know why, why  La-da-da-da-da Tell me I love this or I'm craving Like a toxic medication You come in like a siren singing La-da-da-da-da La-da-da-da-da La-da-da-da-da I think today we want to work on the water. Hello Skyloft. Hello Micron Online. I am glad you like the video. Hotchat instead of Topchat? I didn't know that was a thing. So, over the past week I spent a lot of time completely rewriting Mario 64's audio engine. I am now almost finished. There have been great improvements. It's a lot more memory efficient. I can do a few cool new things. And now I understand the whole codebase. Meaning it's going to be very easy to debug any problems that may occur. Which is very useful for the project as a whole. It's also all my own code now. Or well, mostly all my own code. The interfacing with the RSP is still Nintendo's code. But the interfacing with the RSP would be removed anyway if we made this like our own game. So I think we're fine legally to just use this in our own game now. The audio engine. Because all of it is completely different. As long as we change the way we interface with the RSP as well. Or like remake it. In our own words. I didn't know that was a thing. What does it do? I've never been in a YouTube stream.  Anyway. Our work today is here in the overworld. We already picked out a sand texture and a wall texture here. Next we want to pick out a water texture or maybe a wood texture. The original overworld had a really nice rocket robot on wheels texture. That I kind of want to use again. Oh, I see. That makes sense, Jacko. That does seem like something YouTube would do. Let's do this wooden part first. Because it's going to be a lot easier. And it's going to make the game look so much better when we boot it. Hello. Hello, Asko. Let me take a look at the old overworld too. I love this song. It's too bad I can't sing. If I could sing, I would sing so much more. Oh, I see. Well, I'm using a jet combiner. So I can't actually see anything like that. I don't think I have that option. Something more normal than that. Shouldn't be too difficult. Any OST wishes today? You know what? I just want to listen to Ymir. Ymir. Just came back from the RNG video. I have to say, I'm very 50-50 on the RNG video. I feel like it's not a topic that can do well. There's a lot of things that people will argue with me about in the video. Let's see. Let's see. I wish. They are on stream. They're in the bottom left corner. I don't know. I don't know. There were a few people that left weird comments. Like, oh, this is not true RNG. It's like... It's kind of a wishy-washy word, right? Like, obviously, I didn't mean that there would be no correlation between numbers at all. I mean, I said that there would be a correlation if you called it twice in a row. It fades away so fast. Oh. There might be settings I can change for that. Let me see. Let me see. Hide messages after 20 seconds. I can increase it to 40, maybe? Let's try it out. Life in text in a video without video compression. I don't understand. You're starting one in a few days and she was upset because I switched to this video from my favorite video, which is all more Odyssey cutscenes, but now she's fine. Babies are stupid like that. My baby's favorite thing, she's like almost nine months now, is eating the remote. She loves eating the remote. That's all she wants to do. Will we ever make a Yoshi Garden version with full console compatibility? Very unlikely. Why do you hold me? Like you always hold me. Every time I try to escape you bring acetate and I bite till it breaks. I must be insane cause I try. This kind of feels Yoshi, but I don't like the dots in the middle here. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Yoshi's tropical paradise. This one had great textures, right? Like this? I like this a lot. Oh, this is a nice one. Oh, this looks sick. Oh, look at this. I like it a lot. You think you're a cool guy? I didn't make that hack. That's Robart. Go bother him. Ask him to fix it. I didn't break it. It was not me. I'm innocent. I don't know what's to come if my life comes undone. Hold me next to the line as they gaze in your eyes. Love me just to hate me. More love me just to play me. You're a devil in a pretty disguise. Think you could hurt me like you love me? This looks cool as fuck. Don't kiss me like you try. Tell me just to hate me. More love me just to play me. You're killing me from the inside. Now you can tell me that I'm always your slave. Just leave me so heart sick while you fade into the night. Oh. Oh.  Oh.  So heart sick while you fade into the night. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. So heart sick while you fade into the night.              Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.    Hello Selvala. I don't know what stone sleds you're talking about. Uh, I guess we haven't made the first one yet. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Can you hear the sirens? I'm back with my people. Warring heroes. Fleeing no more players. So, we have this scaled up by 2. And I don't like that. Oh, wrong thing. Another croc. Hello Sonic the Hedgehog. This looks surprisingly not like their scene, really. Going so fucking fast right now. Okay. There's advice from R6 for runmaking. Start with a small deck. No, every knockout shows me a sign of who I'm meant to be. Informer spoiler. Give me some time. I'll show you what I'm made of. You'll see. Push me to the edge. I'll fight back even more. I'll be the one who lights the flame. I embrace the challenge, the ring, it calls my name. The road I take will make me a champion. Be the one who lights the flame. Oh, I'll be the one who lights the flame. Be the one, be the one, be the one who lights the flame. I tried so hard. I couldn't feel the floor. With every battle, my body took a toll. Now every knockout shows me a sign of who I'm meant to be. Informer spoiler. Give me some time. I'll show you what I'm made of. You'll see. Push me to the edge. I'll fight back even more. I'll be the one who lights the flame. I embrace the challenge, the ring, it calls my name. The road I take will make me a champion. I'll be the one who lights the flame. Nope. I don't even like Banjo and Kazooie. Can I contribute in some way? Not you, then to anyone. Dude, I definitely could use some textures. Although it's like... How are we going to put you on any specific one texture? I think that would be difficult to do. It isn't like Banjo-Kazooie refuses to allow it, rather. Nice paste. True. You got this! I'm getting so many nonsense comments this is the worst part about making a video. Isn't console compatible? Wouldn't be a case. I have a bad news to it. Most of my romhacks are not console compatible. Like historically. I mean this one is, but because for the longest time we used pretty bad romhacking tools. Many many romhacks are not console compatible. Starroad was also not console compatible, because it was made before Mari64 hacking tools managed to make console compatible romhacks. And for the longest time no one really cared about making hacks console compatible. We just wanted the funny Mario going bing bing wahoo, you know. But what the homebrew community says is like completely fair when they say well you're not really making an N64 hack, you're just making a video game. It's like yeah, that is, that is, do be true. It is kind of funny, like in the grand scheme of things, how for the longest time the Mari64 community was like such a pathetic part of the homebrew community. You guys know that picture where it's like oh guys that are into this, guys that are into this, and then there's like this one disgusting messed up creature and it's like guy who's into fucking ankle pits or whatever. That's what the Mari64 community was for the longest time in the scheme of homebrew games. What brought you to the return of the island idea, like when it becomes a selling game compound? I like Yoshi. That's kind of where the thought process ended. This looks very nice, holy shit. So the question of the game with the balls, you never do know, that's a little interesting in the console. Yeah, a lot of Mario hacks have an issue. Dude, I love this material. It looks so good to me. Where's the dog floating? I guess it's in the water. You want it to sink? Hmm, not sure if that's better. Looks to have support pillars. Well, I didn't say that I'm not gonna add support pillars. Why would you make that assumption? But also, there doesn't need to be support pillars, there could also be floaties underneath. You know, maybe floaties are more playful, maybe we have a fun idea for floaties. That's nice, yeah. Well, ideally you wouldn't even see that as tiles. And it's kind of... do you see that as tiles? Let me think about this. Because I added a noise texture on top of it, so that it doesn't tile obviously. Like if you look at this, you don't really see it tiling, right? Because the noise texture above it makes these three tiles here that I'm standing on look very different compared to these tiles here. So the tiles are not identical, they just have the same shape. At least that's the intention, they have different wood markings. Alright, let's think about the water. What do we want for the water? Since this is like a tropical beach, I think we need some amount of waves. It's kind of crazy how easy it is to make a map look good if you just have good shaders. Or good fixed function pipelines. I guess I'm not allowed to call this shaders anymore. But I'm playing on emulator, so while I'm playing on emulator, these are shaders, fuck you! Um, sorry. We're thinking about just the water shader right now, tea time. So what's this? I'm seeing like open world Mario 64 game. This is all just going to feel open world, and there's not going to be loading zones. But I mean, calling this an open world is maybe a little cringe. What if this wasn't floating on wooden posts, but rather on rubber duckies? Open zone as Garou flag is the proper term, thank you. Yes, okay, for the waves. I think I want this to be waves. And I want this to be waves going into the island. Oops. Oh yeah, look how poopy this looks by comparison. So giving waves directionality is a bit of an issue. Because yes, we can make a moving sine wave, but like, it's going to just move wherever it wants, right? So what's the proper way to handle this? The thing is, if we do want the waves to actually go into the island, we need to make them come from all directions. No, it's just, you know, the color transition here.  DDD painting effect, but reversed. So we'd have like a point here, and we'd move the vertices out from there. Let me think about how this would actually do. It's a dumb critique to say that the sand looks a bit too orange. Maybe it's just me, but I think a bright yellow. No, that might be fair. I'm not really decided on this yet anyway. We might also just make this grassy after a little bit. For now, I'm just trying to get some beast textures going that look fine. Wind Waker or no clip, let's see. Where's Wind Waker? Is he outside the island? Where's outside the island? What the hell, where's outside the island? No search window? What the? Okay, let's just go to a random one. The Great Sea. Oh, this is cheap. Okay, can. It's the same level. Seriously, are we considering the textures given in BioWare in the real world? We're gonna be trying to set up decent shaders, but it doesn't need to be perfect. Okay, so this would be pretty easy to do, to be honest. But are we satisfied with this? Does this look good enough? Dude, I'm looking at the GameCube game that is all about water, and I'm thinking this might not look good enough. Is Wind Waker and R6 with the same engine? Yeah, they have the same engine. Wait, what even is going on here? Do you see this? Huh? It's just flat? No, guys, this looks like shit. I know, I don't want this. This looks so bad. This looks so dumb. Why is there just flat, nothing here, and then the button just goes back and forth? This makes no sense. I am not okay with this. Let's think about something else. The wet sand does look cool. I like the wet sand. Okay. Can I just call them anything but linearly? I'm not sure what you mean. Do they have monoray sunshine here? Where is the Pinna Park? Oh, the water just disappears when you come close. Well, fucking great, how am I supposed to look at it? There's no waves at all here. Wave 364 water? No. I'm actually not a Wave 364 water fan. So what we could do is we could set a point into the middle of the island. And then we make the water move vertices here. The vertices appear on the far outside. And dynamically build triangles between them. And they go up and down. And the further into the island they go, the lower they go. Or the lower the amplitude goes. Problem I have with that is that swimming in it is going to be weird. I've been trying to do this for a long time and breaking it up with some noise. Until I eventually stumbled upon a result that I was at least reasonably happy with. Well, of course those shaders aren't really possible on the N64. But I think I understand the concept and we can do something kind of like it. Yeah, the main problem with the water is that if we add waves to it, swimming in it is going to be weird. Yeah, I mean we can do that Biobak, but what about swimming in it? That's what I'm worried about. If we have too much waves, the swimming in it is going to be weird. Swimming is going to look weird. It's going to be Marios going underwater and above water. But if we flatten the circle on Mario... I think that's also going to look extremely weird. Not if it's smooth enough. Okay, let me think about this. We have a direction, we have an amplitude. We need the vertices to dynamically build triangles between them. How would I even achieve that? Can I make this a ring buffer maybe? Shit, man. Do we need to swim this area? No. I guess it could be a relatively calm sea, so we'd have waves that don't go very high. Think about this. If I make a ring buffer of waves and they go into the islands by lerping through a far away position and the position in the middle. And they dynamically build the whole thing. How would that look? Vertices spawn in. Oh no, there always needs to be a ring of vertices on the far outside with zero transparency. Then a vertex spawns at that location. Moves towards the middle of the island with a sine wave pattern. The last triangle on the list always connects to that. Can I hex tessellate this? I can't hex tessellate this. Because I would need to spawn in between that. How would I hex tessellate that? I think that's my main issue right now. Let me draw and paint here. Let me draw and paint here. So we have our island here. And then we'd have a function that defines two rays. Something like this and this. There would be a bunch of outside vertices here. I'm also not the vertices of black. There's a bunch of vertices here. And a little bit of an arc These would spawn vertices that travel in this direction here and go up and down on the sine wave these spawn vertices would build a triangle like so and Then as soon as the next vertex is spawned they will connect to that spawn vertex So far so easy Which means we will have lines of vertices like this That all go into the islands and We're gonna have Connections like this the problem. I have with this is you can see the squares and Squares are really not nice looking for a wave effect like this Yes, you would get a denser mesh closer to the shore but Considering the size of the island it would not be significantly denser. It would be maybe like 10-15 percent denser The problem I have with this though is that like they're here That looks terrible so maybe we need twice the vertices on the outside and We alternate between them So That we can get the hex desolation, I think that's the way to go that actually sounds like a good plan They should turn Yeah, and that's that's why we double the vertices and get the in-betweens That way we want to actually like, you know connect triangles like so And then all of this here would have no transparency and all of this you would have no transparency and all of this would have no transparency But you have to double to get the in-betweens What's a double it's like double minus one So Someone said but three aqua star stage three Oh There's maybe one problem with what I'm doing and They think about this so the waves are going up and down in the sine wave fashion and they're moving into the island But does that look different at all from a just being a sine wave function? I Yeah, I agree my back that would look good That's what I'm saying look different from the sine wave at all I Don't think of this. I think it's just a sine wave using Distance from the center of the island as a parameter I Guess no waves. Let's don't get that  Yeah, this is a lot of vertices Each point on the surface rotates in a circle to produce the pattern. Okay, we definitely cannot afford that But we can do like Maybe we can do like, you know this shape here and then we've seemed to do Or not quite like that maybe more like so I Would be best do that And this is also like such a wild ocean right this is like look how this is like a full row I Don't know if I like that being a full row like that I Don't really like this We could maybe make this like a Squished sine wave Like Instead of the input range being like this we have the input range being like First half is like elongated and then the second half squished Yeah Oh What the fuck is this Why can I not add this, huh What is this why can I not make an edge loop here What the hell I Just used to work I'm pretty sure I Think all inches and subdivide them I'm like very sure that you used to be able to do it Oh Sir quads, no way It just sounds wrong Sorry guys, I keep checking the comments because I'm getting so many people commenting questions And I want to make sure everything goes over smoothly  Okay, this looks poopy It's only 370 a triangle still maybe if this was fanning less it could kind of work And then something like this could be used for Making sure that it's not too obviously tiling You know what I mean Like this part And then we can move them all inwards But I'm still not convinced it looks different from the tree just a sine wave Whatever I use the vertices distance from zero or from like a fictional location The input and then just move this in a sine wave that I squish slightly It's not an hexagonal pattern. Yeah, that's that's good. I didn't know it was done an hexagonal pattern, but that's good I Still thinking about it gives me a little bit I Do that Other problem is we need so many vertices for this to look anything decent, right? Let's use this location as a base for our circle here Let's do a hexagon 666 75 triangles, it's honestly not that much What if you did something away first by the child's ears higher on the player that's Xenus of our angle, I don't like that I think it looks cheap And it's also not really fitting and way for isn't make sense because they have very extreme waves we don't really have that The problem with this is that if we do go with that wave type the girster wave Then it's not gonna be visible because the distance between these two is just too big So we need traveling vertices and if we have traveling vertices this is going to be so much more expensive I Even with 25, it's nowhere near enough. So I think girster waves out. We can't do it That idea has to die Oh How was it called gas now It's the wave You there's not much Unless we did the density and like one direction higher than in the other Wait What if we double the density only along this line I Could kind of work that has a potential Let's try it fuck it A million triangle water you are correct But it's fine we have the performance  That should be enough 16,000 triangles, okay 4000 3000 Hmm Yeah, I'm not sure 3000 triangles really is a good idea Yeah, it's not gonna work we need a different way I Said I get cheap alternative that doesn't look poopy like sign but better It would have run smoothly at least in this area And some sign X no I mean Okay, I kind of see what you mean That would be like minus apps sign X if we went with that type of wave Hmm What if we did that but also stored We have one along weird, okay You know what we should just try it I have a couple ideas we should just try them Fuck it We're gonna start doing stuff So For this I am going to go with a hex tessellation And This was actually like a fine start Okay, it's like what the fuck Oh We want something kind of like this delete all the triangles you can't see or shouldn't see I Actually for now, I'm not deleting any triangles fuck it it's a waste of time I'm gonna name this Area1Water and delete this. All right, let's make a quick and easy material. It doesn't have to do anything special. We'll just get something simple of like two water textures that are scrolling at the same time. Let's send maybe like a noisy one. I'm gonna make this part additive because it looks cool that way. The texture one can go to fuck itself, I guess. I'll make it a little bit blue. I'll use this texture here. Shit, okay, this looks terrible. I want it to look at least like passable for now. Come on. Something like that. Let's click vertex color 0 or alpha. Layer 5. Transparent. Okay, something like that, I guess. Just cross this direction, so I'm gonna just set T1 to 1. All right. And the texture and then behavior parameter 39. Okay. Is this music to punch my CLC to? What's your CLC? Okay. Am I crying of these children? No, I don't punch you crying of these children. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  No, not your penis. All right, so we got this. Then next I need to find the vertices distance from a point that I will pre-program. I can just use the texture items for this. Okay, that's way too far. Shit. I guess we can't use that. Okay. Keep forgetting it's up x plus or x minus. It's negative. Okay. Find origin, fake number. Let's put this at 48,000. All right. So this should be between 0 and like 128,000. So we're going to divide this by 500. 0, 2, 2, 5, 6 or something like that. Well, not quite, but you get the idea. And then we also need the rotational value. So rotational offset is going to be just eight tenths between the two. So we get an angle. And then we can just set the flag to something like this. The height of this should be around zero, right? There is detection and then. Minus 741, let's just do that. So this doesn't quite work yet. Oh, let's do this. And I forgot this. I don't know why the shit has used that buffer comparison for C-form. I'm guessing it's just impossible. It probably is possible, but you would have issues with emulators. Which I want to avoid. Cool. What went wrong? How could this possibly be going wrong? I actually do not see anything that could crash. What the hell? No, they're not cheap. They're like 30 seconds each. TLB exception on load. What the fuck? In... VAC3F cross? Why is there a VAC3F cross here?  Not what I meant to do. Why is there a VAC3F cross here? I see. Because every single one of these has a collision triangle. It wasn't even the code I wrote that crashed. It was the engine. Where's my water? Oh, there's my water. Bizarre. It looks like some of these values are beyond 32,000. Yeah, if you look at this, beyond 32,000, that means it will not work. It's too big. It's too big. Can you see the video on MathLiary for this? Kind of, I guess. Most of the math is my own functions. But obviously they are the same functions as the original Mario 64 game had. So it's like rewritten versions of those, I guess. What the hell? Let's just make sure it can't be my code. It is my code. And why are the vertices floating? Who put them here? Not me. Oh, I did put them here. Oh, I did put them here.  Okay. Okay, how can my code cause it to... Are these done with the translate comments? No, they're not. What the hell? How is it possible that setting the Y value moves it like that? That is a little crazy. Okay. Yeah, I have no idea what's going on. Unless... It's going like so high that it just breaks. Same wave height max? Yes. They're supposed to be high to the waves. Okay, very bizarre. Surely synths is defined properly here. Oh, wait. Why is it adding flag? Oops. Leftover from a copy-pasted code snippet? That would explain it. Well... The waves are so low that it's difficult to see anything. It's going well, Twister. It becomes obvious when you have a more in-focus person, I think. Now... Do I not increment the water phase, maybe? Yep, I forgot to do that. Cool. Now we should have waves. Let me also make the water semi-transparent, just because it's going to look a lot better. Okay.  Now we should have waves. I like the water one, nice idea for a new level hack. It's cool looking, but I don't see how it can be a level. Oops. Okay, the phase is a little too fast for my taste. Let's see... Yeah, I use Project64. The bad thing is that if someone makes a virus, they can hack you with it. But I'm not making a virus, I'm hacking myself. So using this for development is perfectly fine. Okay. I mean, this looks decent, but it's not decent. It goes way too high up and down. And the wave effect is not really that visible. So I'm not really a fan of it. It looks beautiful, it does not look good. Unfortunately. Do I compile time so fast? Because it's like a small project. Why would the compile times be long? I guess that's the question. You like how high tide water washes over the dock? I don't like that. Well I guess it would be better if it didn't like literally clip through the dock. But yeah the problem I have with it is Mario in the water is looking very rough so we do have to disable the waves around Mario and I want to make sure the water doesn't clip through the dock like that. Maybe we do something like this, 25 coordinates down, minus 7, 6, 6 and I think maybe we can add this as part of the equation, angle multiplied by 8, 8 is not a good value, let's do 64. Maybe I can do 30 then. And then I'm thinking also maybe editing the vertex colors dynamically so that when it goes down you can actually see it being down because right now the only reason you can see it being up or down is because it's relative to something else. And I think the face is way too much, let's do 128, we don't need to subtract 1, we don't Okay, that turned out awful, I accidentally squared the wavelength max. I think this is going to be way too fast now. Yeah, okay, but it's becoming visible, it's just too fast, 512, 0x10 maybe. This looks more like an ocean to me. Now it's starting to look good. But it's still got this problem where Mario is just floating in the air, but I think we can maybe solve that by allowing programmed water height. Looks backward, looks backward? Really? It's false to me. And I think we need some depth in there, so I am going to do something even cooler. We need tinted vertex by inside, that's exactly what I'm going to do, that was exactly my plan, to get some depth in there. It's going to look wrong, oops, it's going to look very wrong, but it might look cool. Why does it look like it's right into the alpha value? Maybe we should keep the dark blue there, then it's going to look better, a little bit. I don't like how it looks, I don't like how it looks, I don't like how it looks, I don't like how red it looks there. It's just a request to add some easter eggs without telling the audience so they find them when actually playing. I did that. If I added easter eggs without telling my audience, how would you know I added the easter egg? Think about that. There are so many easter eggs in this game, you have no idea. Let me turn up the min brightness a little bit. I just don't get why it's becoming, or why it appears to be so transparent, because it definitely is not transparent, but it looks very transparent. I think I have an idea. It's a weird material. Yep, coloring the floor. Oh, I think this is it. Oops. I think I can make this a little more blue now. Something like that. I noticed there was a space missing between the wave height max and something else, for instance, I can't remember where. Is space missing? Space doesn't usually do anything. So that probably doesn't do a difference. Yep, I like this a lot now. I think something like this is what we were looking for. I also love that our combiner takes out the noise, so the sand underwater looks a lot less noisy, which is very fitting. And I think it looks like all the waves are coming into the middle here because of the texture. There's one change I'd like, and that is, instead of the vertex content being flat here, I want them in a curve. So the question is, how do I do that? Maybe like so? I should fade the edges of the level. That's exactly what I've done. But, yes, it's not finished. The marble's above, I'm done. It definitely will. Okay, I think the slight curvature made it even better. Now the waves actually look properly going into the island. It looks very tropical. That's good. And all you need is one or two good RSP state setups, a.k.a. not shaders. The palette has had no thought behind it. I don't think the palette is very good yet. Sure, the water and sand look nice together, but then the mountains don't work with it. And also, the sand and the mountains work well together, but then the water doesn't go with it. And also, this looks nice, but then nothing else goes with it. The saturation's all over the place. It looks really good. Do you think it needs a level of detail? Why are you saying that? It's only 600 triangles, and I haven't even removed the invisible ones yet. Or, if you want a fake level of detail, what you could do is we could remove a few vertices at the end here. I don't know, there's many ways we can reduce the performance impact of this if it is an issue without really affecting the visuals. Like, we could do that. Or something like it. We need foam near the shore. I agree with the foam near the shore. So, what the next step here would be is we cut out the triangles that we don't need, and then around islands like this here, we pick, for example, these vertices here, and we map the foam onto it, and make the foam go into the island. And we're gonna make these vertices move the exact same way the foam does, and then we're gonna use the height of the vertex here to decide the opacity of the foam. Does that make sense? So, like, the more its downwards velocity is, the more foam would be there. Or, wait, this is an even cooler thing. I didn't even show this, but this is a thing we can do. I hate that you need semicolons. Those are not energy drink cans. They are literally sparkling water. Yep, it's bubbly. You see what I mean here? Now we have much higher waves on the outside than on the inside. On the inside, it's barely going up and down, and on the outside we have gigantic waves. The one that's stuck is just a warp that I marked for the craft. I would never drink an energy drink. God, I was actually down to 195 pounds today, this morning. Actually 194, or 3 even, I measured today. From, like, 215. And it's an accident, I didn't mean to lose weight, but I just lost 20 pounds. This doesn't need to line up. Yep, I think I'm happy with this. Let me check in terms of RAM and counter storage. No, I'm not going with an 8 megabyte game, I'm going with 64 megabytes. So I'm limiting myself to end of the N64's lifespan. If you managed, you made water. Anyway, I'll be honest, I'm feeling pretty done for today. Tomorrow is Easter, and I will not be able to stream. But maybe Monday or Tuesday. We'll see. So, I will see you guys next stream. Bye bye!
