Hello, the headset is wrong, I need the other thing. Hello BeeTorque, why does it say monetization is deactivated? Interesting, I just organized my screens here and we should be all good. Hello Kitsune. Let's see where we left off. I don't know what's up with me today, but I'm not feeling mentally clear. Yeah, those ways really have to work better. Oh, and the block can't attack on lateral distance only. We need a vertical distance check as well. Alright, we are at the snowman cave. Hello Selton. Deadshot today, you fell off. Three comments in zero minutes, unbelievable case. Hello Dimensio, Spanish or English? I'll take Aleman. I'm not sure what I'm feeling up to today, music wise. Do not answer, whoever was first is gay. It's gonna be that one, right? Turn on ambient sounds. Yeah, we need some OST. Otherwise my stream chat will go insane. Low-fee free copy. Hello Clayman. What is a low-fee free copy? Mario and Luigi, Dream Team OST. Alright, let's do it. Mario and Luigi, Dream Team OST. Not Kirby 64 again. Kirby 64, I don't know if it was Kirby 64, but there was one Kirby game where every song sounded the same. It was Forgotten Land. Oh, I haven't showed you guys this, but... This is Officer Stun. Thank you for the sub, Sonic the Hedgehog. Case fell off. Fell off the net against tree and hit every branch on the way down. Should probably turn this music down a little bit. Tuna shake, tuna shake is still pending. We only have 1 out of 10 so far. So you can see this now. I really like this. Look, Bowser is so desperate. That pesky plumber. My fleet is ruined. Did he fix the shadows? Which ones? Which shadows were wrong, Leela? My shadow looks like it's on the elevator. Yeah, does it? I think it just worked out because it was going up. But I am planning to fix the shadows. My idea for the shadows is that it's actually going to be a whole separate object, separate from Mario. Yeah, so today our mission is to do the snowman cave. It will be a separate object that finds the floor properly, Leela. That way it will be all fine. So it can have a different floor from Mario. Because for Mario there are some issues when you jump on objects. Why did you make the elevator actually move instead of teleporting the player? Why not? It's just easier. So we gotta think about rooms for the snowman cave. One room I want is kind of like a slide that you climb up. And there's going to be the snowman attacking you on the slide. Another one is platforms over a void and you kind of climb between the platforms. The question is, can we do more than that? I kind of only want snowmen in this area. And I like how this goes into the needle wall instantly. It looks very cool to me. Why are you watching me, Leela? I'm just a little guy. Hello, Skyloft. What are your plans for this week? Dude, we went swamming so much this week. Me and Zeina. We went like every day. Maybe that's why I'm feeling so tired today. What are your plans for this week? But boss, MATLAB has Inferno. Opening MATLAB does cause an Inferno. That's why I never use that software. I'd always get two people that can't do math, but they can use MATLAB. And then they would just do the assignments. That part. And I would just do the math. I don't know why I can't look at JRB from Leela. I know I'm passing, but I can't get myself to get into it. Because I think my copy is going to be resilient and you won't be able to attack me. Yeah, you're probably going to die if you enter JRB in real life. I don't want to use Godot. If I was going to make a game, it would be an Unreal Engine. And I mean, I am planning to make a game in Unreal Engine. Someday. Some point. Use GameMaker with a Kappa and then he says GameMaker is fine. I know nothing about Godot, but I know that Dario works at Godot. So if I ever have any complaint, I could probably just complain to him. We're not going to have a nude beach level. Kiyoshi is always nude. That's not true. He's wearing shoes and a saddle. Although the saddle might be part of his body. But he's definitely wearing shoes. What happened to Zaina's stream thumbnail? It's not there. I think it doesn't work on YouTube. YouTube streaming is still not the greatest, unfortunately. Yeah, Unity kind of fucked itself over with its stupid rules now. So that I don't want to use it anymore. Not that I ever used it. You can wear sandals on a nude beach. Same thing. Is it? I'm doubtful. It's kind of just a Unity class. That's unfortunate. We haven't had anything useful in GameMaker for years. Where's Godot from some dev experience? Ah, I see. Unreal Engine is backed by Fortnite money, so what are you going to do? Oh, right. This is still broken. How is it going to the floor? That's clearly not right. What the fuck? Is it also moving into the plane of the thing? That would be insane. Oh, one second. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Uh-oh. And then for two seconds and he died. Yeah, yeah. So in his brother is mowing our lawn and we have an automatic lawnmower set up. And there's a lot of cable around and he ate the cable, unfortunately. That's why I had to go for a second. But it should be fine. Also, I didn't die, Lila. You died. OK, the thing about the app is the app is actually better because you are likely to access the horizontal axis without accessing the vertical axis, meaning you have better cash proximity. Terry doesn't just work for Godot, he's really just rendering maintenance. So he works for Godot. Hello. Hello. So I'm planning to make a video next about random matrices. I recorded the voiceover today and there's someone who wants to help me edit the whole thing. Which hopefully we have a higher quality video this time and hopefully that saves me a lot of time. Why is this less confusing? Yeah, but it's also less optimal. I cannot, Lila. I'm not a Python programmer. I can put it into chat GPT and ask it what it thinks. How's that sound? OK. Hello. Hello, Blargit. I might just have to... Shit. Shit. I don't have to shit, but I have to fix this.  Yeah, something probably like that works, I think. I don't really like this. What if I add a little bit of prim to it? Just a tiny bit of blue. It's a treat. Ooh. Ooh. It's kinda nice. Have you ever changed the pipeline mode in Unreal Engine? What's the pipeline mode? You mean n-prim versus 1-prim? Yeah, I did change that. It did require one change, I think, to dialogues. I think dialogues didn't work right, but other than that, nothing. As long as you do your pipe syncs correctly, you should be able to just use n-prim. Yeah, I'm just missing syncs. It's not a big boost, though. I think it was like 1 FPS or so. And already being like 42, 43. Did you guys see the video? Yeah, I saw the video today. On anti-aliasing what did you guys think shit hashi hello long time no see it's kind of funny how the one thing sonic characters say to each other all the time is long time no see it's my favorite part hello verza new video well on on the second channel i have a new video every saturday and sunday on my second channel if you did not know is material exactly yes the whole level is ugly right now i can show you guys this look look how fast n64 testing is now that i have to set up i just click the bat and it's there it's right on my n64 isn't that fucking sick fix the delay the delay i have to delay too i can't fix it but yeah anti-aliasing look it's here let me just limit the fps here this is real console yes but i have like half a second of delay so it's really hard to play the game less than 30 fps is broken it does look a little bit broken cool well i never claimed it's perfect on console you see that well it's not perfect yet on console it's gonna be perfect i hope it's just a very small bit rounder it's looking a bit blurry sometimes though it's a fucking n64 what are you expecting would anti-aliasing be redundant of playing on the crt no it still changes the look a uh yeah everdrive is the way to play oh yeah the menu explains everything i like that a lot and even tells you whether something lowers performance or not the diva increases image quality maybe i should rename this because it seems uh some people don't like the diva on we don't know that everyone has been saying his voice is ai and how to turn them off from the video do you avoid this for keep being an issue people with unusual voice for them yes it will shit i didn't export the level well actually maybe people will start complaining less about ai sometime in the future so that's the hope you can buy a summer card but it's a bit pricey or you can buy the chinese knockoff everdrive that does most of what you would ever need and it's pretty cheap so i kind of want this to work like the jrb ship section but with snowman's attacking on top i think that would work really well i still want to sell my ever my old everdrive i should at some point i have serious users but i don't trust people who own the big ai models as usual the problem is humans not technology i know people complain about ai just because it's ai not because it's been used like worldly or whatever or inappropriately right and once that stops people will stop complaining to people about their natural speaking voice saying that it's ai like if narrow is getting people complain to him that he's using ai when he's just talking in his real voice that's a problem is it not ai has been abused recently sure but narrow didn't and then you answer the flash candle isn't absolutely overpriced yeah that's the summer card sure but the negative associations are valid i don't think that a guilty by proxy let's see our discussion this time uh another youtuber was and people complained that he was using ai when he was speaking in his real voice he just had unusual vocal patterns or something like that that's the context you love narrow's voice oh you love the little ai sounding voice Lilaa is yearning for the ai's posers did you find a minty name yet i did not when they can get you invested in something you give zero shits about i guess oh actually no you know what no that's a bad mark because there's so many content creators that just make videos farming like streamer drama they get a lot of people invested into stuff that not a single person on the entire fucking planet gives a shit about and i would yeah so this youtuber has been in a huge drama recently this is worse than peepee poopoo this is the most disgusting thing i've ever heard of since the tuna shake let me go on reddit and see what the people think and then average out the opinion and that is what i believe thank you harshi it's something stinky day and paying time for the admin mark i would never yeah that's completely fair person that's um something a lot of people fall into just humans cannot deal with the their desire for distraction and noise is just so big that if it's there they're gonna go for it people don't enjoy being bored enough they don't appreciate the value that comes out of just being bored sometimes just being with your own thoughts and nothing else and that's the problem and that's a really difficult thing to learn to enjoy who is boring around here wait wasn't the response to that legit something like all the various it should strive for this boredom or something because it's true you should be happy you get to be bored my boy one bezos buck funding the construction of course 13 thank you for your bezos buck leela's brain is just constantly spewing slurs interesting someone cancel this person okay i like this okay maybe it takes too fast he shouldn't be attacking me fast enough that i can't get up let me just reduce this attack rate a little bit oh so you're just yelling slurs at yourself i think that's not cancelable right do you have any memories of being different ala person happy i actually have one where i remember you nagi the eel being a blue shark there is a blue shark in mario 64 you're probably just remembering that guy but no i do not have any such memories as an insult not just the person inserted that but also a group that reminds you so please don't shout them at yourself either leela is in her transphobic arc slurs are made up by youtubers actually to form more engagement on the videos clearly made the most critical wants you to believe in slurs um no i think we're all good you never got to die and i unbox oh maybe you watched someone else get there maybe you saw it in the commercial maybe you had a dream about it i know that i have a lot of false memories from dreams like sometimes there's things you feel like happened but they didn't because you actually just dreamed them deja vus are back true i heard that they come from not being hydrated see for me okay for me there's been a time in my life where for like four years i just lived like by myself alone without ever talking to anyone and that does make you go a bit crazy and i have a very distinct memory of living in a place that i couldn't possibly have lived in like i know i didn't live there but i feel like i did but like the timeline just doesn't match up it's just not conceivable that that's a real event that happens you should kind of start going crazy if you're all by yourself the whole time why are they not attacking me oh what the fuck what happened to them hello sand king i didn't really change anything other than this wait a second it doesn't work because there's two of them And I've never gone crazy, except the time I got really mad at something I didn't see for two weeks. Okay, but do you still like go out and talk to people sometimes? Because when I did that, I didn't talk at all. Like for four years, I basically didn't speak a word. Nope. Oh. Well, if you do that for too long, you are going to start to go crazy, I think. What about family? Family doesn't count. DiscordVC... Well, I mean like family obviously counts. DiscordVC also counts. Yo, thank you for the bits, Yuri. Any social interaction counts. I'm saying if you are just absolutely deprived of that. DiscordVC should not count. It's some amount of social interaction. It's definitely going to somewhat keep you from going insane. Two and a half days. Yeah, that's significantly shorter. Oh, this is kind of cool. You want to touch plants? Then go and do it. Who's going to stop you? But something crazy happens if you're going to be alone for that long. I don't know if this happens to everyone, but this happened to me. I started to just like appreciate everything. I remember being at the supermarket and they were selling sausage and the sausage smelled really good. And I knew I wasn't going to buy any because I had like 300 euros a month minus rent. So like 70 euros a month to eat. So I knew I wasn't going to buy any because it's so expensive. But I stood there and was like, man, this is nice. I like just smelling the sausage. You just start appreciating like the smallest things. I was not topless, Lila, no. It's a great treatment for mental disorder. I don't think so. Are you British? I'm going to stop. Come to London in it. I don't know. I can't do a British accent. We don't stop to smell the roses. We stop to smell the sausage. True. I don't like flowers. I think my main thing is that everything is like a distinct experience. There's always like an idea I want to convey with the things I make. I don't think you can really say that I have a separate style for everything. If you look at something like, I don't know, FOM's easter account, I wouldn't say there's much custom coat or Goomba's easter account. You don't really eat flowers. True. But I think flowers are ugly. Flowers are kind of just color vomit. Clown vomit. That's the scientific word. I don't know. There's a rare chance I've been reforming a new snowball. It forms a snow cube instead. And that would be funny, but I don't want to do that. What do you mean sexual content in RTY? I never did that. This is pure slander. This has to be a full 90 degree turn. So we'll do this. My little pony mod. If you pay me enough, I might do it. But I'm not going to enjoy my work on it. Coffee addiction is kind of bad. Yeah. My favorite in MLP. I can't name one character. How much? Tell me. Well, depends on how much you work. You went in there. Going to charge you like $70 an hour. Just fuck you and your stupid Mod Idea. Am I supposed to say Applejack if I don't even know that that thing exists? These board games give her the dark crew true. It's just a character swap. Well, how are you going to animate Mario's skeleton on a fucking pony? Also, I'm surprised you're being serious about this. I thought you were memeing. If you actually want that, I know some people that can make that happen. I'm not going to make that happen myself, but I can link you up. I want constant simulation through. That's the issue. That's why you are a Zuma, Lina. That's how you actually know your Gen Alpha, actually. Because that's like the hallmark of a Gen Alpha. The constant simulation. Maybe you are Gen Z by technicality. You're sure as fuck acting like a Gen Alpha right now. I don't know. I mean, your brain is supposed to think out if you have nothing to do, right? That's like the point of being bored. You can live out your creativity. Opinions are like pronouns. Only woke liberals have them. Damn. This is turning into a funny conversation. Are you a woke liberal? I'm not sure. Yes, he is. Well, there you go. My official PR account, Lilaa Free TV, just announced that I am now a woke liberal. This is my life now. Wow, that's ugly. Whoa, that is ugly. Oh my God. We need something else. We can't have this. I don't think we can have wood here at all. Okay, fuck it, I'm just gonna leave this here for now. Surely we can figure something out later. No, this is awful. Truly, truly disgusting. I like the platforming aspects of this, just not the way it looks. There needs to be something else. We might just need more ideas for what we want to be in here. We have to justify the compost somehow. Nice.  You're going to the woke doctor next week. Is he gonna fix you? Okay, we need to look at more ice caves. Come with ideas. No one can fix you. That's true, but then why are you going to the doctor? I can fix her. Two days later, how she just fucking despairs. We can make the sliding bar transparent and put stuff there. Yeah, that's likely going to happen. We're likely going to make this slightly reflective and put stuff down in the ice. Fender drifts from Metroid Prime. Only 37 people watching, this is my attention. A lot of people are watching on Twitch. I have no idea how many there are. Yeah, I'm not really seeing anything here that's looking interesting. I like the ice pillars. I like the rocks. Maybe there should be more rocks here. Let's make a rock. Well, if you find the image on Google, I can take a look at it. Aurora Ice Palace. Alright, let me Google that. Oh, what the hell? This is a real location. Well, okay, an aesthetic more like this. Yes, that's kind of going to happen in the actual castle. But this is a cape of the side of the castle. So we don't want that. Hello, Sarah. Let me make this a little brother, so they can get in the way of the planetarium. Change how snowballs move. They already changed how the snowballs move. It's the main way for the snowballs to accelerate right now. So just so you guys know, in five days, my daughter is likely going to be born. Meaning I might not be able to stream next week. Because if she's a day or two late, we might still be in the hospital. Okay. Okay. Okay. But I was not making a secret out of it. It is a girl, so it's not going to be Kayce Jr. Also, I don't want to be Kayce Sr. because I'm still young. I want to be a senior citizen. I'm young and fresh. I'm not bold and crusty. I think Zeina just came home and fell. I don't even know her name. It's going to be Reyna. Maybe Nintendo wouldn't copyright strike you if you were a kid. I don't know if you named your daughter Reyna, but if I did, I'm sure they would. They fucking hate me. Legend of Reyna, exactly. They hate you, why? Because I make Mario mods? They don't like that. They took down 70 of my videos, just so you are aware of how much they hate me. I didn't even know you had 70 videos. Yep. I might not have 70 videos anymore, but I used to have 70 videos. Yeah, that's true, Moritz. Or I think that's true, I heard that too, I don't know if it's true. Okay, I like this section. Obviously it's butt ugly, but other than that I think it's good. That's funny how it just gets stuck there. Reminds me, there's all those enemies from Ace Attack, so just add more objects from the Romance to use. How does the code runner hold up today? It's still widely used. I just don't like the wood blocks here, but the rocks went well. And then a long jump here, I don't know if that's too much, but what if you miss the jump? It's just like, what's the worst that could happen? You go back here, you could even... If you're like a really bad player, you could even do something like that, I guess. That doesn't work. I guess that works too. Questions, is there some way to release the Romance with the optimizations? Nope, there's not. I have not done that yet. But yeah, there might be after ESO is done. I'll likely start like an open source project to do that. And then everyone can contribute to that. The idea would be to port back all of the RTUI optimizations to vanilla Mark 64. I think that's a pretty unconventional way of doing that, Moritz. Look at the stream, that is sad. I thought people in the Mario universe just reproduce through eggs and Yoshi's or something, I don't know. So I have another idea for a void section. I like this one already. Let me just think about how this would work out. But even then, we only have two sections, that's not enough. I think I definitely wanted to brainstorm more sections here. Let's look at more ice caves, maybe we find something we like. This is kinda cool. I like this view. There should be something like this. Will you be able to unlock Luigi playing in this? Maybe. I have not decided yet. Then what do Toodles want from the current Glitz Pit Champion? I have no idea. It's been too long since I played that. Surely someone else in chat knows. What do you mean, takes him down? What specifically would Nintendo do? In your hypothetical question? Gar. I don't want treasure chests in here. Or maybe actually at the end. Oh, maybe the end room should be full of coins and a star. Would that make sense? Like a treasure room? I think so. Okay, but how are they taking it down? I still don't know what you mean. Surely they're not gonna come to my computer and like, set it on fire. That's honestly a fair point about it. They knock on your door and steal your baby? I think that would be illegal and I would likely sue Nintendo. And this castle is going to have most of the normal rooms of a castle. You just don't really see it yet. Like this room here and this could totally be turned into like a library or a diner. This room here could have a bunch of things around. And this, surely we can figure something out. Put some chandeliers in here. Have a big hall. It's gonna be a big hall, maybe. Isn't Marina, um, Miss Chief Makers? Marina's platoon. Oh. Who are the Pinkertons? Is that like a gang? Wouldn't the female version of Mario just be Maria? Not yet, Onion Knight. The birth is supposed to be in five days. I like the cliffs. We should do something more with cliffs. There could be a room that's like mostly cliffs going up. All right, I'll make a note. Cliff climbing, think of Manji's type of stance, what's the hell we have? I was referred to by one word, um, small circle expanding. Can you drive yet? I, I got my driving license when I was 17. What do you mean? I've been able to drive all along. I've been driving when you were still pooping your pants. I don't think that's true, but I'm going to say it anyway. Fuck you. 50s or five days? Five days. If you take an S in Canada. I didn't exchange my driving license for a Canadian one yet. I've only been here for like almost three years. Cut me some slack. Yes, Onion Knight. Can someone who has a driving license know that Germany is listed in one of the big cities? Well, when I lived in Germany, I lived in the city with 25,000 people and I didn't have a car. I just went everywhere by bike and it was just fine. You actually can't live in Canada without a driver's license because everything is so far away.  So if I'm only two years older, then I had my driver's license while you were failing ninth grade math class. There you go. Get fucked. True. You can't just true me. You have to diss me back, dude. You can't just roll over and die. You're gonna make me feel bad. No the name is Rainer. This is already decided. Is three sections enough or well four with the ending room? There needs to be a slight. That's what's missing. We can't have an ice cave without a slight. Like after the climbing, there needs to be a slight going down. Clearly. Slight void room. Something like that. I think we've got it. Some of you guessed the literal only year I failed math. Oh my God. I even got that right. Dude, you're so cooked. What if you can't see into the room where you slide into when you climb?  You had the same idea about it. So again, ice cream cone without ice cream. Okay. I'm going to tell you guys a secret. I don't like ice cream cones. Don't tell anyone, but personally, I think they are just not good. They don't taste good. They're bland. They're bothering me. They feel like an obligation. It's like, great. I want ice cream, but I don't want to eat the fucking ice cream cone again. What's up chat? Hello, Biobak. So you like ice cream and ice cream cones? Yeah. This is the weirdest complaint I have ever heard. You like the cone better than the ice cream? What? It's just bread. That's just unnutritious, not tasty slave food, poverty nutrients. It's just calories that don't taste like anything. It's like someone liking burgers, but not buns. Honestly, I think that's fair. You like bread? I don't like bread. Is that why people say that this is the best thing since sliced bread? Because they actually like bread? It's not just a thing people say. People actually like bread? This is wild to me. You have never had good bread, then? I see. They're talking about the slicing, but also they like slicing bread. What's rye bread? Roggenbrot? Is that what this is? Sandwiches are pretty much the greatest food invention ever, so yeah, I like bread. By sandwich, do you mean the ones you make in the sandwich maker? Or do you mean just two slices of bread, like slapped together with stuff in it? Even a sandwich maker? This. This thing actually burns the bread good. If you use this, it's actually tasty. So the Sandwich Head is the sandwich maker. He makes sandwiches with it. Nice, welcome back, Zeina. Zeina, would you tell your brother that there was no wire at the bottom of our property? Because he cut into it. I think he was operating on wrong information. And I said, well, I sure didn't say that. You thought there wasn't? Well, there was. A lot of it. If you don't toast toast, why toast in the first place? True. Okay, well, the idea is, the idea is, okay, before you put it in, you just have two slices of toast. But when it comes out, you have a sandwich and it's good. How much would you ask to be paid to pluck your entire face with tweezers? I don't know. It depends on how long it takes. Realistically, like maybe, do I have to do it on stream or can I do it off stream? I'll stream, okay. How about probably like maybe like a thousand five hundred thousand eight hundred or so. I'm sure you do this like two or three times and then you're just used to the pain or maybe you can just take painkillers and just go for it. Place a tuna shag with this. Toast sandwich. This just doesn't look good. I'm curious about this model, by the way, this one is pretty off model. Let me show you what I have right now. And three. I should showcase this anyway, but you're going to like this. Case, it doesn't even hurt that bad. Yeah. You think I was asking for too little or too much money? Yeah. Let me show you both this model. Is the tuna shag inspired by Markus Ruhl or did you happen on the other way? I mean, it's an odd thing to come up with. No, it's definitely inspired by Markus Ruhl. I had it before. I asked my wife to make it for me and people think it's disgusting. I don't hate it, though. All right. You see Bozo here? He's so upset right now. They knocked my statue. Enough is enough. I have to send them the block. Oh, that was a shitty camera. But you can see I'm pretty well for here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then of course the black comes with you. Oh that sounds like a good idea Davey. What do nose hairs do? That's actually a good question. Is it to prevent stuff from going up your nose? Cause it doesn't work. I was swimming yesterday and I have very thick nose hair. And there was still water going up my nose. Maybe it keeps the bugs out. I have thick luscious nose hair. To call the elevator too, but when it's stuck on the floor you're not on. Oh it automatically comes back by a bike. At least I think it does. Does it not? Could that be lighting? There could be a gap through the doors where a little bit of fake light comes in. Fake light is already in this. It's just you can't really have this be like vertex based. How small is this slide? This is a very small slide. This is not the real one. Alright let me look into the elevator real quick. Oh wait. Needs to be here. Let's try it. Let's give your resistance to blunt force trauma. That's believable, yeah. Probably not very much though, right? Like 5-10% maybe. That is way too much shaking. Way too much. So we're gonna add a new tiny setting to this. So oh nice pileback. If I make the Koopas not high. Were they that bad? Magnitude. Okay magnitude is gonna be much smaller. Detail is gonna be smaller. Ink makes this. I don't know what ink does. Just make this small. Shake forth small. Oh shake off unused. Oh unused code. Goodbye. They're in Koopain. I added all the texts for all the acts to the workers yesterday. Getting so much work done on cross 11. My plan for YouTube content is 27th. We're gonna have F3. Then maybe 1st of August or so. We're gonna have the Matrix video. And then hopefully sometime soon after that. We're gonna have a demo of course one. And I'm gonna have like a Google document where people can answer all kinds of questions about what they think of different parts of the physics and stuff. Because ideally what I want is to get as much feedback as possible. So I can make minuscule adjustments and get the physics feeling just right. Same with the camera. Is this better? Maybe the FOV shake is too much. The FOV shake kind of makes this look like a bugged camera, doesn't it? Why is it still shaking? I need to stop shaking. Can you make it shake up and down only? No, but I can remove the FOV shake. Oh wait, this is shake pitch. So this should be up and down. This should be it. It starts moving too early. Let me check that. Maybe I should remove the shake of the elevator and only have a shake of the camera. Falling pits just make you take damage? In some levels, yes, Gruber. It depends on the level. Hello, Xerath there. This one, right, it's not really a pit. It's oily water. And I don't know if you can see it, but there's a hole in the bottom of the pit.  Oily water has the property that... This happens in real life too. If you fall down in an oil rig, you just kind of get lifted back up and you lose some health. Because the other workers will rescue you. Fun fact. There should probably be a sound too. So I don't know which one's the correct one. What did you guys think of the shake? I'm not sold on it. I would never call someone in my chat Gruber. I'd still like you to explain what you're going to change regarding the shadows besides making actor. It's complicated. Don't worry about it. Let's go. You guys know that meme where it's like don't worry about a kitten and she replies yay and then heart. I can't reference that. Leela is 17. I think this works. I just don't like the sound. It's a good thing I didn't reference that meme. Soon. No, don't say that. You make it sound like I'm pre-ordering something. You're making me sound so bad Leela. And you sounded so excited for it too. That's it. I'm going the way of Dr. Disrespect. It is over. Oh, I like this. This is a good sound. Also, yes, the office needs a different tune for sure. This is very atmospheric, I think. Will you steal assets that make Asmongold Madness 2? Mario 64 Madness did not steal any assets. All right. You can say many things about madness, but it did not steal any assets. I will have none of that slender. Wait, what if Mario gets squished slightly when he's going up in the element stretch when he's going down? I think he does. It's just so small that you don't really see it. So, it would cause some performance impacts. Not significant, but enough that I don't want to have that be included. One nanosecond. It's gonna be like, like three or four microseconds at least. Fuck you. I care about my microseconds, okay? With self-modifying code, you could for sure avoid that, actually. Isn't she newer divergent than a minor? I'm newer divergent than a major. What's she gonna do about it? I'm an elevator effect. And then the end of effect, just drop the layer by drop to slide. In this area? No, we don't want an elevator. This is all natural cave. Was the elevator music would be deterrent up? We'll try it.  Mayor, Lord, and Caseman, you're on your service, true? Whatever you guys say. I'm sure it made sense. It feels like it's too small. Not find level empty. Why not? Hello? Hello? Did you change the type? Nope, it's still a level route. Yeah, blame me. I remember you saying you added a feature to automatically find the level empty. I fixed it. I don't really want to implement the double cherry. That depends on how many objects you wanted to interact with. But just having two Marios run around would be very difficult. Who are you working with? Mario? Let's go. I have to find some scapegoat. That does sound pretty useful, actually. No, there are there other people helping with this project? Yeah, we got a Badub help and we got a Mario back helping with all the models. He whenever I'm done with the model, he looks over it again and makes it look a lot better. And we got Badub making music. We got Zayna helping with a lot of stuff. Mostly like concept art and stuff. And then sometimes people just randomly contribute small things. What if you think this is referencing the one I saw on Banjo-Kazooie? I have not played Banjo-Kazooie, so any references to that game are completely coincidental. I'm literally innocent. Oh yeah, animations are the biggest one she's doing. What do you call this method of level design? You greybox it first and then you finalize it or something? I don't know. I call it the case method because I just made it up. Expert opinion just got in. This is clearly not a Banjo-Kazooie reference. Good to hear. 100 ways I improved Mario 64. Fast paced list of stuff. He changes like Mario looks at points of interest. Starshine physics are improved. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 100 little things to improve Mario 64. I already have a list here. And I think there's like 80 or 90 on here. So, yes, I have thought about that. Oh, you're going to like this by the way. I now have someone who wants to edit my videos. I pay him, I think like $16 per minute of video. So on like a video, he makes like $200 or so. If it goes well and we can upscale the channel, I'm probably going to up that a lot. But maybe I can start pumping out a lot more videos. I probably can make like 70, 80 videos right now. About random things on Mario 64. I feel like we could hit a million subs if we actually went in hard on that. Should have numbered them. You can just do the math. There is line numbers right here, right? So you see line 8, 7, 3 is 0. Row, so you know that line 933 is number 60. Aren't you at a million yet? I have not tried to make a YouTube career. I generally think it would be pretty easy to hit like a million. I have a list of like the weirdest bugs I've ever seen on Mario 64 that one could do numbers as well. Just there are some pretty wild bugs on Mario 64. Okay, one funny one is the painting in Daya Daya Docks. If you stand there for I think it's like three days, it stops wobbling. That's a good one. And the star select, if you are in the star select for like two years and three months, there's going to be a 10 frame window where you cannot select a star. That's also a good one. No Daya Daya Docks has that wobbly thing. That water wall. I like how you just know offhand. Well, it's not that difficult, right? Because you know that an integer is like four billion and it's like NS32, so you just need two billion divided by 30 frames. That's like 100 million seconds. That's like 16,000 minutes, something like that. Yes, it's very similar, Davey. What dinosaurs do we have in Dino Dino Land? You mean Jurassic Jungle? We have a T-Rex. We have the three dipshits. We have the Koopa that kind of looks like an Ankylosaurus. We have the Yoshimama. We have Pterodactyls. And we have a Brontosaurus. Someone made a Paper Mario tool-assisted speedrun that uses an exploit in an emulator to like hack your computer. I think how playing Paper Mario can get you hacked. That would be an insane video. Are dinosaurs sleeping in the way? Oh, I was thinking it was just going to be like a cave with some funky lights on it. And then when you walk through it, you're just suddenly in the past. You know, it's like when you go to the beach that makes you old. Do we need to do the revised demo idea? I'm planning to. I don't think I would be doing views, no. It's just more so than it's useful for my work. That is exactly what I'm talking about. You went to the beach that makes you gay and venomous? Are you gay and venomous? It's not insane, but the Daya Daya dog thing reminds me of that one bug in Sonic 3 where the save screen music goes insane after 47 minutes. I did not know this. I think there's so many bugs in R64 that would happen after 9 months, too. But I just haven't seen anyone run into any. I also don't know specifically where they would be, but I think there are a lot. Like what? Like maybe the birds outside the castle grounds stopped chirping? Or maybe Bob-omb stopped blinking or something? How long does it take to make a blender level? Well it depends on how good you want it to be. You can do it in 15 seconds if you want. But it's gonna be shit. Yeah, to make a level just download Fast64 and then hit the create level layout. And then you want to scroll down here to the triple A slider and you want to move it all the way to the right. Unless you want a low poly level. Then you move it all the way to the left. It takes a few years to make a good blender level from scratch. Yeah, that's pretty accurate. Some people can't even do it in a few years. Some people chase that high for a lifetime and they never get there. That's actually not the first time I've heard someone propose to intentionally include an ace bug. And I say I probably don't even need to intentionally include that. Because the way I program the game, there's no safety rails anywhere. Surely there will be an ace bug somewhere. Even if stuff like delegate functions, surely you can just overwrite a pointer somehow. Get the right thread switch and write out uncached RAM or something. Dude, how are none of these decent railings? The fuck? This is disgusting. Yeah, Saryn's AGDQ thing was insane. If you use self-modifying codes? I think I do, but I'm not sure anymore. That might be something I held off on mostly until the end, because I'd probably want to write that on assembly. Since doing that in C doesn't give you enough control. Is it something that's less necessary on GBA? I don't know how necessary it is on the GBI, so that's not a question I can answer. Assembly is not needed on GBA, YouTube chapper. What is needed and what not always depends on what you want to do. I don't think you can just blanket say it's never needed. So he didn't use some assembly. The funniest part is when people say that assembly code always runs faster than anything else, and then you look at the assembly code in life and it's just dark shit. It's worse than C compiled code. Where's the music from? Luigi and Mario Dream Team. Have you seen those videos where some mad scientist managed to make functional regression marks on GBA? Yes. The guy started this project while he was in my discord and he just was talking about it. So I knew of this since a while ago. On his first video that he made, I even left a comment. So this was known to me from minute one. I think this is going to be the last step. And then after that, we have a slight. I'll tell my really dummy stack. Thanks, I'm going to speak of nation of actions. Order causes all of my assets to replace my case doing very, but no, no, no, no. That costs way too much memory. Rom space is actually one of our most limited resources. We can't waste any of it. And voice lines specifically are very expensive. And. And. The reason that you have, like, many eyes on windows and objects, maybe you could do the same on the bridge. Yes, we'll probably have some some. I see parts on this texture. These textures here are not final. It's all very just work in progress. It's basically just so I know what's what. We don't have any room space, but this is the future. We do if we want to, or we close it close to infinite. But I obviously want to stay in the limitations of the time. It's kind of a point of the challenge. If I don't stay within the original limitations, am I not kind of cheating? You see the issue. I don't want to finish the game and then people are like, oh, yeah, but to use more memory, though. You know what I mean? Yeah. Right, if you use hardware that came out after the Nintendo 64, why aren't we just playing on emulator? Yeah. All right, that's a cute place, pretty nice. I think figuring out a good way to climb this would be fun, too. You could go over there or you could do that. Or you could just go here. Actually, that part does suck a little bit. Oh, that also sucked. I didn't like that. OK, some small adjustments are required. I don't want to do that because that's weird. I might just have to do this so the wall doesn't push you out. Should be fine. I don't like that you can't get up here. I can probably fix that by introducing something like this, a little bit of a slant. Maybe do this and then also move this down 25 units. And then you can warp it if you want, so it's not that much of an issue. You can also warp it here, but I don't like how tight the space is. So I'm going to move this out a little bit so that warping there is easier. Hmm. This is kind of hard to see from the bottom, but I think it's fine with textures. But because the technic is this at the time, they were just probably expensive and I was going to pay a thousand just to play an N64 game. Yeah. Maybe, but still. If the games back then used 64 megabytes, I'm not going to go more than that. It should be doable with a sideflip now. Let's give it another look. Can you maybe make the bridge more 3D and maybe adding the robust geometry? Yeah, maybe the bridge will just be entirely 3D in the end. Right now, we're just planning the platforming. And we're kind of planning it. Placing the geometry as symbols for it actually should be there. True, Nintendo 64 was called Nintendo 64 because the cartridges were 64 megabytes. Normal fact. Okay, but the bus was 72 bus, so... Take that memo. Can I do this with a flip now without getting fucked here? Okay, yeah, you just get pushed to the side. Nice. Alright, I think this section is good to go. There's many ways to climb this. No right way. What's the fastest way to do it? Definitely not that. Definitely not that. But it's fun. I think I like this. Yeah, I think we're good for today. Next time, I'm gonna do the slide. There's gonna be a slide here, mostly in Void. We probably have to surreal half-clear backgrounds, so it's gonna look very trippy. And then after that, there's just gonna be the room. And that would be the second star's platforming finished. After that, of course, we still need to make this look good. But yeah, I'll see you guys next stream. Bye bye!
