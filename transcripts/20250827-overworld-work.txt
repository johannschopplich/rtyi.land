This is going to be great on the YouTube video, where you just start off with me going meow meow meow. Awesome. Hello Lars Fulrich. You joined? Good.  Hello Lila. Lila, did you see BVH is gone? Where is Kase? Oops. Am I not on the screen? Hello. I'm alive, Lila. Lila, did you see my BVH? Fuck you, Lila. I did the BVH. What now? I mean, I already said fuck you, Lila. Yeah. That's how you know it's going to be a good stream. Hello Graham. Chachabitty BVH or a good one? What the fuck is a Chachabitty BVH? Please explain. And then I can answer your question. I actually don't want these SS16s. Hydration reminder. Let's hydrate.  I mean, I'm not going to lie to you. I had to implement this in Python and I have never programmed Python in my life. So I did ask it a lot how to do things in Python, but the code is 100% mine. It's just a lot faster to ask Chachabitty like, how do I declare an array in Python than it is to Google it? Let's just try to Google it. How do I declare an array in Python? What do I get? Fucking AI. Yep. Stack overflow. Well, I guess this was fast too. Was implemented quickly because I'm fucking goated. Who pinged me? It's my... Unfortunately, I don't even have a singer. Dang. No one wants to sponsor my video with Margaret's the first person to shoot her crazy. When you run AI, isn't that the only way to get quick and systemic questions that would normally take an hour as to one's guilty pleasure? Well, it's just because Stack Overflow is ass. Got the same func marker twice, that was a mistake. Nope. This is... Wait. You are right. This is a mistake. Did I make this change just now? Wait, what the fuck? Wait, how was this working at all before? Wait. Huh? That's a very good catch. Let me figure out what was going on here. Should be this, right? Working on Blubla today? There is a very good chance, yes. Anyway, let me show you my BVH. Look, there's 0% chance that JGPT could come up with this. Look at this. We have... Beautiful. We have check data. This is for both internal and leaf notes. There is just 3.16 stored here because that's the entire quantity range we need. We have a miss index. We do not have left and right. We only have a miss and hit because we don't iterate left and right. We do this stackless. Then for the internal notes, we also have a hit index, which is if you hit this note, then that's just the note we go to. And the leaf notes, they are actually twice the size because they also have 8 triangles. 9 triangles even. And they don't need the hit index. We have this partitioned into three things. We have macros to make the BVH traverse a lot faster, easier, more consistent, and that's how it works. Let me make sure the hitboxes are still making any kind of sense. They are no longer making any kind of sense. Okay. What happened? Okay, we need an OST while we do this. How much time BVH save? Around 200 microseconds even, which is kind of fucking crazy. Seriously though, what did I do here? Wait, that's just a whole... This is an ass. This is not how it should be, right? What is this comment? Of course, this is what I optimized the engine for, clamps. That's the whole point. Okay, we can shorten this behavior comment a little bit. Let me just see how this is supposed to work. I feel like this is what it was supposed to work like, and only be 8 bytes instead of 12. Wow, Lila, why so mean? Unreferenced languages already weren't a thing. Why did it say fuck you, Lila? Because you were asking me to implement BVH over and over, and then I said I implement BVH. Fuck you, Lila. You're literally my bestie, I'm sorry bestie. You know what I want to listen to? Dino Crisis OST. So I have never played the PS... I have never played the Resident Evil game, but I tried Dino Crisis, which apparently is from the same people that made Resident Evil. And... It was fucking ass, but it was like really high quality ass, you know what I mean? It's like, wow, this game is kinda impressive, but I fucking hate playing this. You ever had that? Alright, let's see what's going on here. During the Black Mesa Entertainment 1.0 update screen, would you be able to avoid that by using the IVV direction for that instead? Yes! Actually, someone else pointed that out in the homebrew discord as well. I definitely should be doing that, and that will save me a good chunk of memory. What the fuck is this? I don't think that's what I entered here. 005005 DC? In what world? Did I not compile? Let's try that again. You mean without nostalgia? Or as with, like, maybe Alice? Maybe! I don't know. I have never played it. So it's the same, except I wasted a ton of time waiting for the bus, but my pass wasn't renewed, so you had to walk back to the city. Fuck your stupid puppy life. Your puppy life? Lina, you're not starting to call yourself a puppy girl, are you? This is something I will not support. What is this? What is the zero here? These are all pipes? These are all pipes! Okay, let's see. Make one pipe. I didn't change this at hitbox comments. That makes sense. That was dumb. Nope, I don't make release dates until I know exactly when I can release them. You're calling me Zuka, too? Okay, these are reasonable defaults. Let's see if that worked. Okay, what else could I be doing wrong? LHU. LHU. 0C25. It's loading the next comment. Let's see what I did wrong. Right? There we go. Dude, I had the most cursed bug ever today. This box here. Whenever it was rendered, it broke the entire game. And you know why? Because I was rendering the stars on the floor here. How does that make sense? Well, in the level file, the stars on the floor, they are just a black texture. Fully black. Which means the file is all zeros. Which means that when I built the level segment, that was put into the sdata segment and discarded. The bss segment and discarded. So while it did generate a valid pointer to it, it also discarded the entire data. So this valid pointer just pointed to the display list for the exclamation box. So instead of rendering the floor, it was just breaking the exclamation box. That's so dumb. No, I'm not gonna add those, Graham. But that's actually a good idea for a star somewhere. Like you have to jump on these cat platforms. That would probably work really well. I think Starlord had that. But yeah, that was a really dumb bug and I'm glad it's no longer there. MSGCC is all fucked up. Compilers are dangerous tools and you cannot underestimate them. I don't think that was even a compiler bug or anything like that. I think that was just 100% intended to work like that. Was it a dangerous assembly? Yeah! In a compiler, it's just a dangerous weapon. Okay, our plan for today. One, do some work on the lighthouse to make this look slightly presentable. It only needs to be looking okay. We're also gonna add the spin thing here. And then after that, we're gonna program the warp to the area here. And once we have that, we're gonna program the booblas and the Pandora's box here. I cannot guarantee that we will get all of that done. But that is my plan right now. What did you think of the transparent boxes, by the way? I thought they looked awesome. This song is pissing me the fuck off. Why is it 15 minutes? It looks sick, I love it too. Is it recognizable as Yoshi? Um, no. Although, I mean, think about this. There's people that see Jesus in chicken nuggets. I feel like those people are going to be able to see Yoshi on my island. That's the kid. Kid's doing fine. I didn't give up on the idea. The island just became less Yoshi-shaped as we made progress. There is a chance we will Yoshi-fy it, though. I think Biobank said, don't worry about it, I will Yoshi-fy it. I'm just not worried about making it look like Yoshi right now. That is the simple honest truth. You guys got any fun PS1 game recommendations for me? Or PS2? We just recently set up a hacked PS3, and we have a controller now. So, we're trying to catch up on all the games that we never played. So far, we have played Ape's Odyssey, which... Man, that game has so much personality, but it's so annoying to play. God of War? Is it like Hooper? No. I love dinosaurs. There needs to be more games with dinosaurs in them. Spider-Man 2. The thing is, I loathe everything superhero related so much, just because of how intrusive into my world they are. Like, if I could pick how the world was, I would maybe reduce my exposure to superhero garbage by like 80%. And then I'd be happy with it, and I would enjoy the 20% that I left. But because it's 5 times as much as I wanted, it's pissing me off too much. Also, we as a society do not clown on movie directors and movie writers enough. For like, writing all these movie tough guys that are just like, this is not how a real interaction would go. Everyone you talk to is just setting up punchlines for you, and that's the entire purpose. Oh, multiplayer is even better, because I play with my wife. So she can play with me if we do multiplayer. Oh, right, I put the giant cylinder here. What? It's an animation rework? It's epic? What does it do? I have not seen it. It's just a Mario and wild oranges in every level? That was weird. What's different in Anvila? I have not seen it. Probably makes me feel sad at the moment. It's not the level, I'm not talking about being able to fly or smart. No, I like that fantasy. I don't like this... How do I put this? A lot of it is just this absolutely cringe desire to be a tough guy, I feel. Like, they're tough in such unrealistic and stupid ways, that it makes me feel like there's something completely wrong with people that like it. You know, when it's like, someone pulls a gun on you and you just walk up to the gun and they're like, oh, shoot me, you wouldn't dare. And then they do like a... When they take the gun and the other guy falls to the ground. Like, that's just so dumb. Like, oh my god. There's just something wrong with you if you're like that, I'm sorry. Vanessa being red-pilled in Epic? I don't think that's it. That's the point of fantasy. Are you thinking of it like, oh, if a bear was like fighting me, I would simply hit it on its snout and then slide behind it while it's confused and choke it out and win that way? Are you like, thinking in those terms? Because in that sense, yes, I can see that being a thing for superheroes, but they're so popular that it just seems unrealistic to me. That's when that cutscene is fucked again, awesome. Getting muted for making a basic comment is wild. Good to know that whoever it is needs to control the narrator. Don't worry, I'll take off. Wait, wait, Todd? No, come back. What did you do? I didn't see your comment. Who muted you? What did you say? Shit, I want this guy to come back, I wanna ping him or something. Maybe I can, like, add Todd's stopper. What did you say? I don't need to mute you. That's annoying. Now some guy out there thinks I kinda muted him or something. DIY is self-destruct? Yes, that's a lot of what movies look like to me. Guys, did someone see what the guy said and what he got muted for? I wanna know. Is he trolling me? Muted for making a basic comment is wild. Wait, you deleted a message from Lila? Oh, I see. Oh, but that was a different guy. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. No, I thought that was someone else that just thought he got killed for something and I didn't see it. I see. No, that was a valid mute, I think. Did you mute him? Yeah, I just didn't like the idea of someone out there thinking I was censoring them when I wasn't. But given that it's likely someone's second account and Lila muted them, like, yeah. You can't see any of the comments you're reacting to? Huh. That's even weirder. By the way, the new video that I said was doing terribly now is doing great. Fucking YouTube trolled me. Guys, for the N64, have you considered to just buy more memory? Stop crying, don't be cheap? Did you think about that? Stop crying? The people that, when you make a basic complaint or like observation about how something could be improved, are like, stop crying? Oh my god, they deserve a special place in hell. It's like the same as telling someone stop making excuses when you're explaining something to them. Top 10 worst people on the planet. You ever had experiences with people telling you stop making excuses when you're just explaining the fucking answer to the question that they asked you? Oh, good, well. Okay, as long as you don't think I timed you out for like no reason. I mean, if that was you, I think Lila timed you out for the transphobic implications. Huh. Wasting the oxygen in the ozone layer? Isn't the ozone layer like way up in the sky? Sollipsism? What is sollipsism? The quality of being very self-centered or selfish? Like, if someone explains something and you take it as an excuse, then you're likely very selfish? I guess I can kinda see it? I have seen the low-tier god video. Right. Hello, Amy Rose? Oh my god, is that the real Amy Rose? Huge fan. I loved you in Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. I wish they gave you a bigger role. I believe you're the only sentient mind in existence. Oh. Okay, that's a belief I subscribe to. I think for all practical purposes I am the only sentient individual. And the same is true for everyone else. We're all the center of the universe in our own universe. You can't disprove me. You're not special. They say in the stereo, but no, like everyone is like, look, everything's happening around me. Like, what do you mean? Everything that happens, I see through my eyes. Does that not make me special in my own world? What is going on? There we go. That's a terrible texture. And there's very few considering the fact that actually I am the only sentient being in the universe. Yeah, exactly. How does the FDX2 record work? Like, how does it get loaded and what exactly does it do? It works the same way FDX2 works, just better. Honestly, there is like very little API difference even. You can almost just copy paste it in and it just runs better. It's like swapping out your graphics card for a better one. Also, very exciting news. Now that collision BVH is done, I only need to update the OS and I predict the OS updates are not going to affect the rest of the game. Which means we are finally done introducing regressions into the code base. Oh my god, that's going to feel so good. I can actually just make the game and the game will get done. You guys have no idea how good that will feel. I shouldn't be thinking about textures so much here. Let's just pick a thing. I actually want only two prongs on it. Is everything engine-related? Yes. Yes. I also need your opinion on this. I was thinking that maybe now that basically every engine change is done, maybe once the OS is also done, I can make a video summarizing every optimization. Honestly, I would probably make a 10-part video series about that. It would be literally like a future-length movie about just every Mario 64 optimization. You think that's a hype idea? I already wrote out a few parts. So the parts would be part 1, hardware from configuration and like an intro. Part 2 is matrix building, collision, sound, assets, actor handling, game tech, operating system, Mario and then miscellaneous stuff. I have an HDMI modded N64 so I don't need the retro thing. I also have the analog 3D, but I haven't configured it yet. I have a lot of parts for the game. I have a lot of parts for the game. I have a lot of parts for the game. I have a lot of parts for the game. I have a lot of parts for the game. I have an analog 3D, but I haven't configured it yet. So I actually don't know how good that is. Okay, good to hear that people are excited about that idea. It would probably legit be like two hours of content. There's some measurements that can make sense for people that don't know much about programming this time. Yeah, I got a lot of comments being like, Hex 4000 case, what the fuck are you talking about? Do you mean 16 kilobytes? But like, it's just so much easier for me. Making series and diagrams so that they're easy to edit into a combination afterwards. That's exactly the plan. I'm thinking I'm making a 10 part series with sponsors all over the place. Obviously, I need money. If I'm going to make this, I want to make a good bank out of this. And then afterwards, I'm just going to remove all the sponsors and edit it into one big YouTube video. That's just two hours. You do have a rotating Fresnel color-minted light beam atop the light, right? So what about flashbang screen every time it points across the camera? No, it's not going to be rotating. You're just going to rotate it once. Actually, there's this castle inside. But isn't that proud of sponsors? No, actually. This is perfectly fine. I think I'll just need to leave them up for a month. That's always the deal, one month. After that, you're free to do whatever. Not a light beam puzzle, no. This is just the thing you rotate once and this will open the level. Wait, I can show it to you in a second. Is this the next video on Bob-ombs? It is! What is that AI trainer? I was thinking of making an in-game Mario that learns to move Mario by itself. Like an AI that can move Mario. I discarded the idea of doing that because training was too expensive with the old condition functions. But now that BVH exists, I might actually do that. Why is it funny for you? You'll see, man. Calm down, puppy girl. You do not get to say that to me. I get to say whatever the fuck I want. You called yourself a puppy girl. You did this, Leela. Don't forget. Are you saying I'm not cool? Are you saying I'm an old, uncool man? I said fuck your puppy life. It's a meme. That implies you are a puppy. Finally, a Mario Time- spending guide. Okay... this will work. Now we just need to push this thing. The idea is you push this and maybe 90 degrees? And then the cutscene starts. Maybe either direction is fine... And start from another direction. Am I even watching the whole thing? Hmm... I think Act Idle works that way with Action State. Oh, it's Act Walking. You know what? Better idea. We're just doing that. Are you gonna vertex cut at all, or is that all I have to buy back now? I'm not sure yet. Yep, exactly, woofoo. He said, fuck your puppy life, and it's a meme, sure. You guys remember 2017? It was a social experiment, it's just a prank, bro. That was awesome. Now we need to check the direction in which Mario is pushing. How do we sensibly do this? Yeah, and get the face angle jaw and see if it somewhat matches up. Yeah, let's do that. It is a meme. Your entire life is a meme. Oh yeah, the demo is not meant to have everything working perfectly like that, I guess it's just a good bonus level. As long as the level itself works well, good. Is Opacity in S16? You know what? We will be a little bit better with our variables than that. What the fuck? Mandatory evacuation due to a natural gas leak. The current evacuation zone is this, this, this. Okay. I don't think that's me. Oh my god. Life gassing. Too rude. Why are you working in a dark environment? Because I'm a creature of evil. All right, let's see if this worked. Well, that didn't work at all. Not even a little bit. What the hell? We also need to check if Maurice's distance is big enough. Actually. Why is this game glitched out so often? Where do you see the game glitch out? Lunar rocks. I see a... What the hell? Why is this happening? It's like it doesn't matter... Oh! That's why. Are they invisible geometry like in the Source engine? Yes, they are. Just the wrong direction. I did both in the same direction. It also goes too fast, which I don't like. So let's do 0x10. Actually, let's do even less. 0xC. Let's shape one lighthouse. So it's in 8. And then, while this is happening, we also need a sound. In every other way, it seems like there's a crash. That's because I have a lot of asserts and I don't do null pointer checks or anything like that. So when there's wrong data... Basically, okay. The crash you saw in the last video was in DrawShadow. I can show you. Search... Right here. So before, what I had is... I had if the floor pointer exists and the floor is valid. So this wastes two cycles reading the floor pointer. I thought this was silly, because this is just working around a bug, which is if there's no floor. Instead, I made it so that the game now crashes and it notifies you there's no floor during the render. Which means that now, when there's no floor during the render, I have to go into the actor and I have to actually make it have a floor. Which is going to look better, because now every object will have a proper shadow. And before, the engine was just hiding that. Basically, I don't let bugs happen. I just make the game notify you of any bugs that would happen otherwise. And that's why you saw the game crash in my last video. See, sometimes in my short videos you will see bugs like that, simply because I haven't gotten to fixing it after I made a big engine change like that. That will affect a lot of things. It is going to literally take me seconds to fix, or maybe minutes. So there's no reason to worry. Wait, did I reset the Bperms? I did, I did reset the Bperms. I mean, if you want to convince yourself that the game isn't as buggy as it seems, you can just play literally any of the demos I put out, and then you will see that. Okay, there was one issue, and that is that the reset cutscene thing didn't seem to work correctly. Is initLevel not a good place to do it? I'm not sure. Oh, this Mario is here again. Yeah, this one isn't focusing the proper thing yet. I'm connected to a crappy engine and it's on, I've totally become trash. Oh no. Now why is the cutscene... Would this be better? Happy, happy, happy. Check the intro cutscene still plays, cool. I think this crash just worries you. Yeah, you're worrying about nothing. It's very normal to have crashes like that during development. I mean, you've played the demo, right? Have you played the demo? You've probably not experienced any bugs during the demo at all. Actually, that was the flagpole glitch, but that's it. No crashes. Hm, nope, that wasn't good either. Hello, Asco. I have to control the intensity of the texture so you can fade out edges when we have an annoying scene. Yep, yep, definitely. This is just like BVH, which I get working within one day. True. This is just like BVH, which I get working within one day. True. This is just like BVH, which I get working within one day. True. I mean, if you put this into an area, does it still work then? This is what we had last time, and it worked fine. I mean, if you put this into an area, does it still work then? This is what we had last time, and it worked fine. That works, okay. The problem with having it in an area inside is that it also kills the level cutscenes, so we can't have that. Also, this should be doing intro cutscenes. Let's find where it was. Let's find where it was. How is this different? What area is where? I definitely have to refactor this entire DoT area stuff. I don't like how this is done in the original. I don't like how this is done in the original. I don't like how this is done in the original. I don't like how this is done in the original. I don't like how this is done in the original. I don't like how this is done in the original. Honestly, I think I will fix this bug after I'm done rewriting Warps. This is kind of silly to make right now. Let's move on for now, we'll do that after the refactor. Let's move on for now, we'll do that after the refactor. Maybe we should add some of these funny hills to the first overworld as well. Do you remember seeing one of these when you're up to every once in a while? Maybe how many things. What constitutes a thing? I'm not sure how to answer your question. Next thing of part 3. Right, so the Ghost Ship. We need to make the Ghost Ship so that if you get close to it, without having opened the Ghost Ship, you just warp out. I mean, if it was constantly crashing, people wouldn't like it. All I can tell you is, if you want to convince yourself that the game is going to run stable, just play the demo. You will see the demo is perfectly stable. Every now and then I release a version of the game that is stable, like a stable release with demos or competition hacks. And between full releases, I don't care about stability. Because that would just be wasting a lot of time for no reason. When you're rewriting the engine this much, you do constantly break things as well. That's just the nature of the beast. Was the issue for Lost Impact really that it was unstable for people? I mean, I know there's that one sound crash in Ghost 3. But other than that, wasn't the issue mainly that people thought it was jank, and they couldn't figure out what the game wanted them to do? All I can read are difficulty flags. Not so much that it's unstable. What things do you create work on? Well, my main job in this game. That's a level important issue, okay? Alright, now we need to make it so... I guess if you are over this line here... No, there should be a radius around it. It's a U issue? No. It's a Leela issue. Maybe 4000? Let's do that. LLT time. When is this month you should make the launch trailer for N64 Star Commercial? Yeah, maybe? I'm not even sure. The thing is, if I ever make something like that, Nintendo just takes it down. So I have to make a video that is transformative. Which, someone making an entire remake is not transformative. It's not transformative. So, yeah. That is true. Modern games are incredibly buggy, and I don't like it. So, I say... This area here, if you enter it, that's where you get warped out. Or to the level. Are you sure it's... Yeah, but Nintendo doesn't care. They just take your YouTube video down. The thing is, even if they do, it's not transformative. It's not transformative. It's not transformative. It's not transformative. Yeah, but Nintendo doesn't care. They just take your YouTube video down. The thing is, even if that is transformative, and they take the video down, I'm still gonna lose all my attraction on the video. I have to make sure they don't take the video down, or I'm just fucked. Yes, there is actually a separate overworld music here for this part. Yeah, but I kind of need to wrap it into something else, honestly. It just otherwise doesn't work. Oh, we actually have an interesting problem here. How do we actually move the knights if we don't finish the problem? Don't worry about it. Oh, we actually have an interesting problem here. How do we actually move the knights if we don't finish the problem? Don't worry about it. It doesn't matter if big people play my game. I mean, it would be cool, obviously. But that's not going to fix my life. Why do modern games crash so much? I actually don't know. Because they can get away with it, I would say. I think there used to be a time where you would be heavily criticized for having your game crash so much, and you no longer are, and that's why people don't do it. Probably a result of day one patches, day two patches, stuff like that. Did I make the beach in this ship a bit more decorated? Yeah, it's probably going to be a 3D ship. Will the entire game be up to the quality of the bunny brushwoods level? If that level is perfect? Let me think about it. Let me... Let's say bunny brushwoods is like 100 points. Let's see what the other... I think... With the wingcap side level, maybe like 85. Rainbow Grotto, I think for a lot of people would be 100. Mario's Wild Life World, I think this one's like 70. Ghoul Guide Galleon, I think this one's better than bunny brushwoods. I'm going to give it like 110. Jurassic Jungle, probably also like 100. Koopa Carnival, one of my favorites, I think also like 110. Lofty Number of Leaves, maybe like 80. One Bubble Dome, also 100 for me. Divine Dino Domain. This one's probably way better than bunny brushwoods. Maybe like 120. Body Body Bane, also maybe like 85. This one kind of sucks right now. But that's because we haven't had any beta testing done yet. So this still needs a lot of improvements. Same with this, same with this, and same with this. We've only really had tests on the first 10 levels. This one had one test done. So these four kind of suck right now because we haven't had any tests done. But the rest I think is pretty much on par with bunny brushwoods. Why is it not the last level? The level order doesn't matter, don't worry about it. It doesn't mean anything. We're going to change the in-game level order. It also had Koopa Wave Kofa's level too. And Divine Dino Domain has level like 10. Don't worry about it, baby girl. Don't worry about it, puppy girl. You're not getting away from puppy girl. You did this to yourself. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. One needs to be permanent, yep, that's what I thought. I think I spent your commercial money, wasn't I? No, I don't remember that. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. I'm gonna kill you, woof woof, bitch. This also needs to be bigger in the collision map than it is in the visual map. Alright, and now, oh, oh, uh, that didn't work at all. Why did it not work? Is this a health reset or something? This is the one flag, so... Seems like it, right? It didn't set the safe flag. Wait, I never set the safe flag. Oh, I must have, I must have removed that. Oops. Let's try it one more time, this time at least a little faster. Oh my god. Any next OST wish? I played to something very cursed that I'm not showing on stream. Did it just still say zero on the thing? Did I see that right? It said zero? It said zero, are you fucking kidding me, how? Partners in time, alright. Oh. That was so dumb, that was really dumb. That was really dumb, why did no one tell me that I did that? You all saw it, and no one stopped me, huh? Now it showed the two, alright, now it's working. Just gotta make sure we get warped to the level now. I don't have to speed up, but I'm faster that way. It works. Mr. Music, none of your business. I should have connected the star or something. Please tell me I have a safe state, I don't want to open the thing again. Okay, good. You can actually let me take a proper look at that. I'm surprised this level still works as well as it does. I think I will soon get a demo ready with just the first five courses and the first Bowser level, and send that to a tester. That stopped working? Wait, did you see that? The cannon stopped working and shot too high. It used to just hit that perfectly all the time. I don't want to fight the boss, I want to just get the star and save my game, please. Also, don't worry about this, I know what this is from. And I also know what this is from. Lila is a puppy. Alright, next, Zena's swing animation. Oh, the Yoshi's on the thing. Shut up, Lila! Hello, GTM. Right, and after the swing it's boobla time. Then it's finally time for that. Is this his animation? Looks like it. What just happened? Why did it change to Yoshi-no-Yoshi-no? That's concerning. I remember it's this banger in Last Impact, the song. Please pretty up the area, at least a little bit for it. No! Animation 13. Why do you want me to pretty the area up? Biobank is going to fix that anyway. He's going to change everything. That would be silly. Can you kill them? No. I think I only need half this animation, and then I just set his animation frame to something appropriate related to his rotation. That should work. Yoshi new anims undeclared? What the hell? Am I not including group 0? We are not including group 0. Hello, Barambitta. Man, lots of bad programming practices from when I didn't know C. What did you do? This is default Mario 64 behavior, I'm pretty sure. Nobody also made the area with the zoom already? Make the beach white and put some skeletons? Skeletons? No, group 0 is not included in behavior data.c. That's what I'm saying. Of course I loaded group 0. I didn't say shit, Zayna, they're trolling you. Unbelievable. Let's see, so the Yoshis are going to swing backwards, right? They're going to swing backwards like this, and then they're going to swing forwards like this. Then as soon as they reach the peak, they do this. Which means that as soon as their swing hits a certain animation frame, they need to do the thing. Alright, we'll do that. The swing is a full swoop thing, right? We're just going to look at the animation file. I will never hit export script loads. I don't want Fast64 touching my codebase. For no reason ever. I'm going to get rid of AutoTextureScroll's Fast64 put in as well. They are awful. Look at what they did. Right? Look at this. This is running every frame. I'm sorry, I'm sorry Lila. I didn't mean to ruin your puppy life. I didn't mean to hate on your puppy life. Fuck you, nevermind. I got her fighting spirit out. Just like that, we beat the fighting. She cannot hate herself if she's so busy hating me. We start here, which is where Yoshi leans forwards. Up until frame 45, which he leans backwards. So, until he leans... I should shake this out a bit. Okay. Hmm. Don't loop this one. Let me think about this. Let's see this one first. So, starting at frame 45, he leans backwards. Right? So... Before that, he is fully forwards. Okay, so... Map 45 to... What is it? 65. Okay. 75 to... 65 to... 0 to... 20. Okay. And then we wanna map frame 15. No, not 15. That was honestly a bad call. I think we should start at 55, not 45. So, then we can map 0 to 15 to... 5 to 20. That makes sense to me. And then the rest should stay as is. So... Okay. Should this be it? I forgot the semicolon somewhere. That NM frame doesn't exist. Ech. Also doesn't work. This works. Okay. Let's see how that works. You're out? You deal with Zelda. No! You do it! Now I can't stop imagining Lila as a cute, lovely woman. I'm sorry, Lila. You have to deal with that. You're our only hope. Okay, I need the star for the Yoshis to show up. Can you get Lila back in here? I need you to get Lila back in here, please. It's a good thing that adds to the world. At some point, you'll be able to use it to launch more or something. Wait, what am I talking about? Oh, no, no, they have no function. It's just the Yoshis frolicking. Okay, the animation frames are completely fucked. Completely fucked. Holy shit. What did I do? That actually makes sense, because one of them is backwards, and I didn't think about that. So when they go backwards here... And then this is when they go forwards again. So that should be frame 115. This should be from 20 to 5. 20 minus frame frame minus 15. And this should be from 15 to 0. Are the Yoshis tweaking? They're tweaking. Maybe they're just having a good time. I also did not do this correctly. This should be 0. Or 1. So when they go backwards, that seems fine. I don't know why I put 0 there. That's obviously nonsense. I don't even know how I had the idea to put 0 there. Looks like when I wrote that code 5 minutes ago, I realized that there needed to be a 0, but I put it in the wrong spot. Okay, they're tweaking out for one frame here. What is that? What is the tweak out frame here? That must be a negative value. Wait, obviously it is. Okay. So at 115, we start at 0. We should be going up to frame... Do we actually hit frame 120? We do. Oh, this is 121 frames. That's dumb. Okay, so we do hit frame 120. So this should start at 14. Is there a keyframe issue in the animation? No, it's just because the animation is messed up and it has 121 frames instead of 120. It went to a negative keyframe, basically. Like a keyframe that didn't exist. There we go. He's still sliding a little weird about it. Which I do not like. Let's see. Yeah, it's because he's in the air like this that makes it a bit difficult. Let's be sped up a lot. No, I'm not doing that. That's not the right thing to do. True, this is a lot like Last Impact. Are we doing some weird offsetting thing for the Yoshis here? Maybe? Is that the issue? Nope, we're just getting the joint position. 0x59, the Yoshi's from Geo. That should just be the position of the last bone. Maybe I just need to move Yoshi a bit further forward here. Will Lua fit into the dive for you? Unlikely. Like, we can just start, we can take a look at him, we can maybe see if we can make the video it's all N64 compatible, and that's about it, unfortunately. Doesn't look very clean. I guess part of the issue is also that the bone thereon rotates more than they do. I might have to fake it a little bit like so. Just counter-offset it. That fortunately looks very possible. To be honest, before I do Boobla, I probably want the box of Panora anyway, because I need to program that to spawn the Booblas. Oh, I did the opposite of what I should have. Oops. Ah, it clips into his ass during the animation already, so not much I can do here. Hmm. Hmm. What if I put this here? Oh, there's audio-romics for that, though, the engine stuff and... But then why is it so bad? I mean, the animation frame is clean now, but the way he moves around is really, really disorienting. Wait, what is this? How is the Yoshi swing even rendering if this is its geolayout? There's no way it's just a delay, right? No, it doesn't look like it's just delay. I guess... No, nevermind, Yoshi is not offset. Well, actually, yes, Yoshi is offset. It would be easier to fix if we always planted his butt on the floor. Like, maybe now the offset is constant, which would be ideal. There is no point on him that's, like, actually fixated in place. So I think we have the problem that, for one, all the positions that we get out of the armature are delayed by one frame. But if we offset the animation of the Yoshi, that's not possible. And I guess there's also the issue that Yoshi doesn't rotate as far as the swing does, which I'm not sure that's even fixable without changing the swing animation. And we could change the swing animation. That might just be what we have to do. Maybe the swing is just too extreme here. We could make it faster and less extreme, maybe. We might just have to... Wait. What? Is constantly at plenty now? That's obviously also not what I want. Is there a simple way to just dampen the keyframes without having to redo the entire animation? I just want to bring all these quaternions closer to zero. Well, to the identity quaternion. Maybe I have to remake the entire swing animation. But imagine if it only went up this far. That would make Yoshi's watch easier. No, it's fine if they're short. I don't mind. Let's replace the Yoshi's with an exclamation box and see how it actually moves. It looks like the box is constantly slightly below the swing, does it not? Yep, this is centered around zero, actually. Wait, is it? No, it's not centered around zero. So its origin is at the bottom of the box here. Interesting. So what if we appended this before the last thing? Now it swings even less far. I mean, to be expected. One is way too far and the other is not far enough. We could do something like that. That might help it. Hello, I'm your cat. Yoshi's just floating in space. Cool. I guess I moved her too far up. You are. You already did a lot of work. Yeah, it's like his butt is constantly falling behind the frame. Wait... It's constantly closer to zero than the rest of this, right? Is that accurate to say? What if we just offset him parallel to his rotation a little bit? I mean, his rotation is already lagging behind anyway, so we might as well, right? Let's just see if that makes it a little bit better. This actually is not how you do it. We do it right here. We do that and then offset amount equals... Let's multiply this by a small number. Let's see, that's like 16,000. We want like maybe 16 coordinates, so 0.001. Let's make it visible for now. Let's add a sense patch here. It is kind of a dumb fix, but it might have to be necessary. It's because we set the rotation to be so dampened. Yay. Let's make this truly gigantic. We will not get dizzy. We're not putting e-stacks on everything. No, it's certainly visible. It's not what I had in mind. Let's get the material. What even just happened? Is it because the pitch changes signs? That would kind of make sense. Okay, that's closer to what I expected to see. Let's have something less extreme here. It looks decent forward, it looks horrible backwards. Don't tell me I shouldn't have put the apps there. Now it looks both terrible forwards and backwards. So, this might just work. I do not like a screenshot, please. Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Alright, just his feet clipping through the floor I don't like. How about volumetric frog? We don't have volumetric frog in this game. And frog is somewhat expensive. I mean, we could add frog to this game. We already have frog in this scene, but it's not volumetric. Let's see if I go here. That reminds me. Why is it still so high? I guess it kind of makes sense, frog to be like that. Okay, so for the Yoshis, it's still not quite perfect. I think when they're like this, they might need to be a little forward. What? You can definitely add frog, but not volumetric. Oh, it's the opposite. They actually slightly forward when they do this part. That's not too bad at all. We definitely have levels with frog that I don't like. So it's not like frog is incomprehensibly expensive. It's just I don't really want to use it everywhere. I mean, I guess this level here is a good example of a level with frog. I think it has frog, I think, but maybe not. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe there's no frog here. I might be completely wrong. Is the inside still there? It does, surprisingly. Oh, but I broke doors, right. I forgot I removed doors. Will the swinging Yoshis knock back Mario if he gets kicked? Nah. All right. Now all that's left for part three is the Booblars and Pandora's Box, which is what we will have to do next time. Yeah, unfortunately, I don't think I have time for the Booblars today, the Lighthouse and the Yoshis, and the other thing was too much. So I will see you guys in the next stream on Saturday. I think I have Monday off next week, so actually we might have free streams next week. But yes. Until then, bye bye.
