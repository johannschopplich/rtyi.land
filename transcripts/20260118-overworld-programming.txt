you you you Hello again, David welcome to the stream I made a lot of progress off stream. Let's make hello my mosque No webcam today. I was on the wrong scene here we go You I was on my record my screen scene Today is a low-key kind of day You know what I mean Hello tiny man hello, Sarah. I am having a good day You How we claim it Yeah, so off stream I Made a lot of progress on the overworld in fact. I finished this entire area. Which is no longer a beach it's now industrial Harbor I Added a secret star. I had a secret level entrance With the 100% original code project being done. I just have a lot more time for stuff now I Added a secret star in here too. I'm sure you can already tell where it is if you open your eyes a little bit We're easy to tell from up high Finished a homebrew thing what homebrew thing Selling cars a cameo. I'm not adding myself to the game You Are Yoshis related to Platypus or are they still dinosaurs? That's a good question. Honestly, if you think about it, Yoshis are probably very similar to ducks. They have a similar vibe to me. And like the body shape too. What are Gumas then? Mushrooms. You guys ever think about how weird it is that animals evolved motion but mushrooms and plants didn't? Isn't that fucked up? Is motion just super rare to evolve? We're selling basically no plant with motion. I mean I guess there's plants that move a little bit but like a good amount of motion just doesn't exist. Okay but there's so many animals that move. Sunflowers move? They just move on a different time scale? Okay but you know what I mean. Why is there no fast motion on mushrooms or plants? Don't you know how stupid and fucked up people are? I mean that's not unintelligent, it's just ignorant I guess. I don't know. I don't know. Hello Jordan Elliot. How does the rising lava level really stand out from the first bowser level? The first bowser level is not timed. The first bowser level has the lava advance automatically. So in that sense they're two completely different concepts. Yeah but it's like passive right? They're shaped like a thing that can be moved. They're actually actively spending energy to move. I heard there's mushrooms that move actually but they're like microscopic but they have like flagella. Which that was very surprising to hear to me. What are we working on today? Overworld part 11 out of 14 or 15. Lion molts definitely move. Really? I need a Noah Steve for today by the way. It's so quiet. Too quiet. Okay. Yo for a NES game this is funky. What the hell? I expected absolute dog shit because it's a SNES game. I think. Or NES game. Piranha plants move. That's true. Actually yeah they close. Isn't it so weird though that there's so little movement in plants? Like you know how like a mouse moves? You don't see that in a plant at all. Let's get the biome back. You know what will be next? A couple side levels and then just the final Bowser level. What's on today's work agenda? Make the entrance to the flipper level. You know what? I should just show you guys what I have done off stream real quick. So you guys have an idea. So the oily boily bay level entrance now exists in the overworld. You just kind of sneak on the oil tanker. The secret level where you go inside the oil tanker I cut it from the list. Because it's stupid. To play in this level is stupid. You really don't need it. It doesn't do anything. It doesn't add anything to the game really. It's just more work I think. It's just more content for no reason. And then we have this overworld here. There's going to be after you beat act 3 of the oily boily bay. There's going to be a pinball machine here. And there's a wiggler in front of it who said he's opening an arcade with all the parts on here. And let you enter for a thousand coins or something like that. And then... This is the overworld. What do you think? It's supposed to look like an industrial harbor. Does it make you feel industrial inside? But even to oily boily bay through a pipe? Now that you mention it, there was an idea like that. But I guess that is just not implemented here. Yeah I much prefer this over the beachy layout I had before. The beachy layout fucking sucked. It sucked. I also did some stuff here. This is going to be the entrance to the conspiracy theory Yoshi house. You just kind of roll the rock away and then you can enter. And then one last change I decided on off stream. This overworld here. This also sucks. I don't like this. This is just another mountain village. It feels very anticlimactic. Like you have to go through so many trials to get here and then it's just another Yoshi village. We can't do that. So I'm thinking this overworld here will be repurposed into Bowser industries. This is going to be all like lava. This is going to be destroyed nature. And this is going to be where Bowser's minions sleep and live and eat. And this is all taken over by Bowser. What do you think? I've been a romhack inspired by I guess Peach's Island in the 80s and I'm surprised there are no Peach Furious style hacks. Yeah. Honestly I'm surprised too. I thought it was a really cool concept. And there were some great design ideas in there. People seem to really like it. And they're very easy to make. Did you know that Peach's Furry only take I think 6 days to make? So imagine if someone used like 2 months and put like a 200 star hack together like that. Actually that would get very exhausting to play. Don't do that actually. Is the Bowser area the volcanic spouts area? Yes. Well okay let me just recap. There is going to be an evil hint block here that like insults you in rhymes. And there's going to be an evil hint block here that insults you in rhymes. And there was that whole Kamek arc in the Yoshi village before they despawned and turned friendly. So after that, that's the last barrier in your world. After that you reach this area here. Which is right now a Yoshi village. But I'm thinking we're gonna cut this whole thing down. We're gonna turn this into a volcanic area. Which fits because it's right next to the fucking volcano. To make this feel more like a final area. Why is there an ice volcano? That's not an ice volcano, that's just a mountain. Kind of like a glacier mountain I guess. That's where the ice village entrance is. Quest 13. Can I see it? I'm curious. More fidelity and more polygons in Peach's Fury. Given current tooling, how long would an aspiring modder with privacy experience need to produce a simple hack with a custom level? That depends on how good you want it to be. You can definitely do it in one day. Will Kamek reveal after this overworld boss he wants? Nope. Probably not. I don't think so. One day for a polished tank with sensors and all that? Yeah, that also seems reasonable. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. Yeah, the most efficient and downgraded game is the one where most people take over five seconds to make a game? Huh. Mario 64 hack in Python, Java, or R? Yeah, people are using the Mario thing. Basically making a hack in Java or whatever. Didn't Nintendo make Mario 64 hack in Lua? On Switch or Alstos or whatever? Not Switch or Alstos. Mario 64 or Alstos? For the HD textures? Well, it depends on how much you work in that one week, right? You can very easily just shit something together in very little time. But, I mean, if you have a week and you spend four or five hours a day, and this is your first time, and you want to make something like a simple custom boss, maybe one custom enemy, and then three stars that are just platforming, and maybe one star where you have to do a little bit of a mission, something simple, a week seems very realistic. That is assuming you already can use a 3D modeling program. If you want to use Blender, I would say just use one week to just learn Blender, and then the second week to make the game. That sucks for your mouth. If you learned your lesson. Alright, we should now have a Wiggler here that asks you if you want to spend a thousand coins to get entrance to his arcade. Ah, nevermind, I forgot something, we need more texts. Okay, we need three texts for him, or four texts rather. There's one where he asks you if you want to buy access to his arcade for a thousand coins. Yes, I'm putting it at a thousand coins, fuck it. Then one where he says you don't have a thousand coins. A little bit cheap. Then one where he offers you the traits, and then... You don't take it. And then when you do take it. I don't think you can in Mario 64. My engine is different of course, my engine is awesome so you can. No, the arcade is just one game. It's pinball. Pinball. Wigg is looking forward to my next pinball level. There's three things that are guaranteed to happen in the KSEC. The first is you see a toilet. The second is you're escaping from a prison. And the third is a pinball machine. Don't worry guys, this time the pinball machine will be good. This time it's gonna be different. This time it's different I swear. Bro just one more pinball, I swear just one more it will be good. Just one more bro. Rusty Bucket Bay? No! I didn't want people to think of Rusty Bucket Bay here. What made you think of Rusty Bucket Bay? What's pachinko if not pinball? Hang on, I'm opening my own account, let's grab something from the hard drive. Did you just take... Did you just take a hundred coins? Oh, that was the bad price. I don't want to have to put in the code structure to support that double layer of conversation. Can we condense this into one? I like the rest of this though. What is the mission inside pinball machine? You are going to be riding on a pinball. Probably one with a star inside it. And you're gonna have to go across the machine to the end to get the star out. It's basically how it works in our galaxy. Hopefully less cringe. My vibes are more vivid. I mean it's still an issue if people think of Rusty Bucket Bay and they don't like it. But it is what it is. I guess the ship looks a lot like the Rusty Bucket Bay ship. But the ship is just supposed to look like an oil tanker. I actually used the Google image of an oil tanker as inspiration for this. What do you think of the cube on the Wiggler? How cool is that? Since he opens an arcade, the fact he has a cube instead of a flower, I think it's awesome. Can you do it after the first textbox? Mario gets knocked over and then the pinball machine laughs and says it's not the first one kind of interesting enough. I don't wanna. Not sure the proper dialogue. And then after this the pinball machine will glow and you can jump into it. That's my idea of this anyway. That's my idea of this anyway. That's my idea of this anyway. That's my idea of this anyway. Where's the sea shell? I think that's the one I always use. I think that's the one I always use. He has a test for now. Oh shit, it moved on to Block. Isn't that the one Biopack mentioned earlier? Is that the same musician or something? I don't know. I'm leaving Bikes and everyone here. Oh, you can change the name on hacks, but then your actor name isn't going to render correctly. So, have fun with that. What the hell? What the hellie? That's not what I wanted. Why did it bring me to D? Oh, because I didn't want to just do D and E. It doesn't set the safe flag apparently. Hmm. Yeah, I didn't want to make it two separate interactions if I can avoid it. It doesn't need Sparkle or do anything here. Am I not getting the star flag? Nice, I've been ice core grinding for the reward. Oh my god, an autoplayed until banger. Let's just print the flags and see what happens. Yeah, AI is not really quite there yet to actually help with important things. The flag is being set. So it's the flipper that's just not doing anything. Am I being stupid? The action should for sure change to 1 when I get on. This condition doesn't pass. Can I make it pass the first week without safe states? Damn, okay well. It is a difficult game. I mean the alternative to printf debugging is opening an emulator with a debugger and dealing with a lot of pain in that regard. Let's move this. No, that's stupid. What the hell? How could this flag ever not be true? I wish I could just look at the compiled code and see what the compiler did. Because I don't trust this. Let's make a stupid mistake that I'm just not seeing. Let's just print what this is. This should be 2-0. Very clearly, but it clearly is not. Let's also print the result of the if statement here. I'm getting desperate. 32. You mean it's 2-0? The first one is 2-0. One left shifted by shop flag arcade is 0. Oh. Because this is already left shifted. I'm so mad. I'm so mad. Print numbers in decimal format? No. Not if I do %x. Wrong level. There we go. The particles weren't very visible, though. I don't have a lockdown. Why the left shift in the first place? Because I thought it was just going to be 5 and not 1 left shifted by 5. Okay. That's a little more inviting, but that really needs to be moved up, actually. I need a safe block in this overworld. Why is there none? Oh, I haven't added safe blocks in any of these overworlds. Okay, well, we gotta fix that. I think this one might actually just not need one. This one should have one, though. I'm just going to browse if you want to see it. Now you know. 64. Hmm. What a mess. But I had to wait for the exponent anyway. Right, I wanted to look at your hack, but it didn't work, because there was no video set, I can't look at it. So, unfortunately, I couldn't see it. Try that again. Bottom right 64. Bro, you can't even look at it on YouTube. This website, look at this, it doesn't work. I don't know what to do. All right, I guess we can mark this off the list. After Act 3 of Oily Boily Bay, a guy quits his job there just on the island, looking for a new work. Should be a regular one. Remove the regular work on Act 4 plus in Oily Boily Bay. Verify it doesn't crash. Okay, we're going to do that still. Middle clicking works. No, middle clicking doesn't work for me. Oh, I see. So is this just RHDC being sucky? This song is cool. The gravity feels way lower. Am I crazy or is the gravity lower? Is the game just lagging? Is this just what interpolation looks like in Hekamar 64? That's pretty cool. Have I ever taken a break? I guess when my fiancée came to Germany, I spent like a couple days being more busy with her, but I think I was still working on this in my free time. Oh, I see. Yeah, I don't really do... Well, I guess when my child was born, I forcibly had to take like a one and a half day break because we were in the hospital. I guess that's the longest break I've had. Can we verify the guys still work without him? I have to do that. Because I'm a bit worried they're just going to crash. So laptops are for though? Well, I don't have a laptop. And I also wouldn't really be able to work on this game from my laptop. Crash. No crash! Okay. Cool. Seems to just work. Are you like that with projects that you have to pay for or for everything? I don't take days off ever on anything. Like, if I have a day off work or something, then I will use that to get something else done. I'm very mindful of how I use my time, I guess. I always want to progress my life in some way when I have time for it. I mean, I guess you have to think about it this way. You have to spend, what, a hundred dollars a day just to keep your family alive above water? So you have to work a couple hours every day, and then when you're off work, that's what you work for, right? You work for the time you have off work. So when you're off work, you want to use that time to the maximum, because that's the resource you've been working towards the whole time. That's your main resource. That's the thing you made. And then to not use that would be such a waste. Well, it just wouldn't work for you? Well, they wouldn't have my ROM egg on it, so I can't work on it. Unless I spend a lot of time setting up everything and getting Git on there and getting my current compile on there and, like, yeah. I guess it's technically possible. There are some serious graphic issues here. I'm pretty sure my daughter has been on stream before. Currently at her aunt's. Well, I don't mean aunt's. I have all my work on Git. Smudge. Alright, well, we did that. Course 11, oily, boily, bay. Simply enter the wrong thing and we have that. I think part 11 is done, except for a side level we want to spawn later. That's pretty cool. That means... Well, actually, there's one thing I want to work on in the Mushroom Plains. And that is the evil yapping exclamation box. Or hint block. Oh, by the way, I got your stuff. I got your stuff. I got your stuff. I got your stuff. I got your stuff. I got your stuff. I got your stuff. I got your stuff. I got your stuff. I got your stuff. Oh, by the way, you're still here. Did you get the invite I sent you earlier today? ... Wait a second, what? I don't know. Who knows what the future will bring. I kinda hope I don't have to do commissions far in the future. Because I'd much rather work on my own things. I think Xena has some new detectors here. Let me find that. Yeah! I also have to keep in mind that just because I have a day off... You know, my Romhack doesn't mean I have a day off in general. Because I can still work on my YouTube scripts in the meantime. I can do that one on my phone. He's cute. I like him. In my day job, I program video games in Unreal Engine 5. Did I make the face too? No, I would say the face is just the right size. He's awesome. Would you make an original IP project for N64R instead that you could earn money from it? That would be cool. He's awesome. I like him. He's awesome. He's awesome. I should change the primitive color too, I think. Like, what if this was a sappy color and this is an angry color? Something like that. I think he needs a 2-second buddy. Even if this is bad, I don't know what to look up. If I want to use the USB for the inside of an M2X, what tools are available? Use rules and use. I tried to do that. It didn't fucking work. So, I say just use something else. Like the summer card. But a lot of other people are saying that it does work and that it only doesn't work for me. So, maybe it does really work and I was just being crazy. So, I'm thinking he's going to have one friendly place like this and then one unfriendly like that. I don't know. There is the USB loader for the Everdrive that is supposedly working. And it kind of worked, but it did crash my Romagon boot. So, I don't know. Yes, definitely get the summer card if you can. If you haven't ordered the Everdrive yet, get the summer card. The Everdrive... No one should buy an Everdrive anymore unless it's second hand and cheaper than a summer card. Then you want a budget option. That's what I think. But there is this pervasive myth that more expensive equals better. And the Everdrive is more expensive. But it just isn't. It just isn't better. It's just more expensive. Yo, GTM. Oh, Zeyna and Reyna? They're doing very well. Reyna is hanging out with her aunt right now. They just went to church. Gang, do you think it's a good idea to send your child to church? Your female child to church? I'm thinking I'm okay if my daughter goes to church. Like, this might actually be good for her. But if it's a boy, then I'm like, that's kind of a waste of time. Am I sexist? I don't know. Maybe I am. Like I said, a waste of time for men versus women. I think a lot of religious institutions are there to protect women from men. And to make men less harmful. To keep society stable. So in that sense, I think it's good for a girl to grow up around the values of the church. At least a little bit. Not the more extreme stuff, but some of it. Men need to control themselves and stuff like that. But for a guy, I feel like you should just teach it to them yourself. Have you ever sent any child to church? Let's see. Can you teach it to a girl? What? That doesn't make any sense. It's not about teaching the girl the thing. It's about her being around other people that believe in this thing. Ahem. I just think the world is very dangerous for a girl. And church makes it a little bit less dangerous in a way. Yes, if you go by the text, yes. But if you go by the culture, no. It's not about spirituality, it's about the culture. Of course, I think the spirituality of it is complete rubbish. Were you sent to church as a child? We have a thing called confirmation, I think. Where as a child you go for two years, for an hour each. And then at the end you get €600 or something. And I went there because I wanted the €600. But literally everyone went there being like, I just want the €600. Church is it? Is Greek orthodox? Hello Kevin. Yeah, not really. I don't think many Christians live by what's in the Bible. I've never heard anyone burn a red cow and then spray the ashes across the temple when they get their periods. What do you do with the €600? I invested it. I never spent any money on anything as a child. Okay, so you need to spend money on things or we're going to stop giving you pocket money. And then they just stop giving you pocket money because they wouldn't buy anything. Yeah, that makes sense. Oh, I have zero interest in going to church. I think it's a complete waste of my time. Anyway, but in judgment you go. I mean, I would probably have to go because people would tell me to go. And they would get mad if I didn't go. I don't want to go to any marriage ever. Do you guys know how bad weddings are? Have you been to one? They're the worst. At the end of a wedding they like thank you for attending. You better thank me. This thing fucking sucks. Why'd you make me go? You talk about it with him. What do you mean it? It's fun if you like all the people there. Probably, but if you just go to a wedding where you don't know fucking anyone. It's a bottom five human experience this moment. Dude, I went to one and I went there like already kind of hungry. And food was supposed to be served at 6.30. They were so fucking slow. They served the food at like 8. And then the food they had, it was like 300 calories. It's like a seven-year-old schoolgirl maybe would have been satiated. And then after the main course, the food, they gave out cake. And the cake was a single piece of toast with a strawberry on top of it. That's literally what it was. I was so mad. It was Canada, not Germany. I wasn't paying attention. Okay, I don't know what you guys are yapping about. I probably shouldn't have brought up this question on stream. Because I knew, I should have known it was going to turn bad. Should I object when they ask? Oh, that's a good idea. I object. You can't get wedded. This wedding sucked. There was no food. You don't want to remember this as your big day. Make sure you don't turn your daughter into a freak, but I'm sure you got that on lock. Yeah. I wasn't even thinking that that could be a thing that happens. Obviously, I wouldn't want her to actually believe in it. That's fucked up to say. Okay. There's snacks before the sermon available at least. But they just needed to do fucking something so it doesn't suck balls. Wait. 1.7, 400 was fine by me. Okay, but it was like 500 calories tops. It was like 200 grams of food. In my country, I studied to celebrate the wedding of Southern European leader of Spain. I answered to Germans with your money and going to a nameless wedding. That's pretty awful. I mean, the best thing if you don't attend, if you want, but also. I don't even want the funeral. I just want to just be left alone when I die. I guess that's so much to ask. Yeah. Oh wait, this is not the face one, it's the other one. 4.6 I'm soon to be the eternal stache that you would do, that would be so good. Honestly, if you like, I think if you died right now, your family would do that. Something like that, they would do that for you. You know how like when a child dies, they give them like a spiderman tombstone or something? It'd be like that. 5.6 I remember my exit time and getting launched out to space, but you know, we all don't get what we want. I think by the time I'm like 70, we'll have cracked the eternal life. I'm not worried about dying. What's been happening? By the way, I asked you earlier if you got the email I sent you. I sent you an important email, actually. And then you missed us talking about... ...religion. Oh no. 6.7 Spiderman tombstone sounds awesome, can I get that as an adult? No. Wow, this looks like shit. I know why. 3.2 I remember saying I wasn't at all, but I feel the vibe is that I'm a bit off. Maybe some harmonies or green ratios? No, the vibe is supposed to be like that. This is Bowser area, it's supposed to feel wrong. It's supposed to make you uncomfortable. 4.3 Who's blue and smells like ass? It's the plumber that won't pass. That's kind of what I imagine the block says. 5.2 That's like 100-ish. Okay, so we can make them about twice as big, but it's weird. 6.3 What's with the oompa loompa? I'm not well versed in Mario large. That's the hint block. From Yoshi's Island. 7.2 They give you hints, but this one here has been enchanted by Kamek and now they're evil. 8.2 9.2 What was the flag? RXAC. Oh my god, that's stupid. Why does it work like that? It should not work like that. That's bad. That's the remnants of really, really old code. I should be doing it. No, I haven't! Dude, in the work in Mario 64 against Banjo-Kazooie for the past year or so, all we've done is just import enemies from Banjo-Kazooie into Mario 64. It feels so sluggish. 9.3 I'm excited to be done with the Banjo-Hack. Why am I even doing it, man? I'm gonna release it that everyone's going to not watch the video and then it's just going to be like, why does this exist? I'm pretty sure... No, you can't skip this, actually. It's good. Why is he not animated? Why is he not animated? You thought that was released five years ago? Well, there is a Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie hack that was released a long, long time ago, but it's different from the one that we're making. It was made by the same guy, actually, but no, that's not it. You know what? We can keep the typo. I don't care to fix it. Did I make another stupid mistake here, or what is going on? Did I fuck up a blender? I must have fucked up a blender, because they're all the same bone. Hmm? Nope, this looks correct. Unless I didn't actually set up the materials. I did set up the materials. Set up the materials, but they're all linking to the same thing. Is this a bug in Fast64? It has to be a bug, right? What if I swap these two? Would that make it work magically? No. Now one of them has two switch options, and the others still don't. That must have been the wrong one. Did it even import the textures? The other textures are here, but they're not linked up. What if I activate bleed and inline? Not linked up. Am I using this wrong? Is anyone seeing something stupid I'm doing? What if I pick all? This shouldn't be rendering correctly, but what if I do? What happens now? This shit makes no sense. Besides spending 10k, I was making a game, geek and so on. What? That's not a complete sentence. What's the animation supposed to do if you describe it with words? Swap two textures. Or materials, rather. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm not doing anything stupid. Oh, I see. It exported the materials, but... Wait, what the fuck is this? Are you seeing this? What the fuck is this? Huh? This export is completely broken. Okay, well, there's definitely some bug reports in here. Let's report those. Okay. And then the other bug. Okay. And then the other bug. Okay. And then the other bug. Okay. And then the other bug. And then the other bug. And then the other bug. Can we add plus 22 materials? That could be fine, but it could also not be fine, I can't tell. It's probably salvageable regardless. Yeah, we can probably save it. Oh my god, it didn't export the original face. Are you fucking kidding me? It didn't even export the original face! This is awful. It didn't export the original face, what do you mean? What? Material links up a texture, but the texture is like 95% of the material size. Oh, this is sad, this is annoying. What do we even do about this? I think we just can't work on this right now. The tool is just bugged right now. I can't fix it. Unfortunate, but it is what it is. We'll work on this another time. Is it possible to write a script that can exceed all dimensions for a level? Definitely possible. Can you save before stop rendering since you realize how much of the time? Sure, but how much RAM do you want to use? You need RAM throughput to render anything at all, so you're not really saving any time doing that. What's the big Yoshi skull landmark? Well, since we cannot finish part 11, or part 10 rather, we gotta do part 12. It's the big Yoshi skull landmark. There's a big Yoshi skull landmark here. Builders refuse to work for a boss anymore and now build houses for money? I don't know if we still do that. I think there's enough here already. Grand Saint Batlin entrance via train. By train you take the bridge out to enter for 1000 coins or something. Train goes through the sky, visible from part 1. I like that a lot. We're seeing lava, a different bone dragon. This side level there's a geisha pushing around. Nope, we move this to something else. As soon as that area is burned from all the lava, we see Yoshi's story bone dragon here. He's pissed and spitting lava at you. He has some cavities. When you come close to him, he bites and you can punch his tooth. He blows the tooth, he becomes friendly and thanks you and tells you that you can now take a ride on his nose if you want. After you prevent him, the local smith at Monty Mall offers you to smell 200 coins and a gold tooth that you can carry to the dragon for a star. After the star is connected, he has a happy animation whenever he sees you. That's cool. The Monty Mall smith only becomes evil after you beat the Monty Mall mission at Grand Saint Batlin's. Okay. Let's write this down as to-do. Add cave drawings of the redemptions getting beat up by Mario and saving the Yoshi from the momma. I like that. Part 5, Underswap of Altas. Yes. Leave a message block that insults your rise. You can't finish that. I'm unrestricted. Part 10. You cannot enter part 10 from here. That is nonsense.
