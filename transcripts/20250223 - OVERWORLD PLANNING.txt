Hello? There we go. Hello, Claymond. Hello, Ensa-Tahshio. What do you do for a living? I program video games. Hello, Easy1000. What do you do for a living? I program for Gears for Breakfast right now. Hello, Bingus. I don't know about 2025 release. But you are correct that this is the last major thing we have to do. After that it's more like small things. I'm really sick today. My audio is skipping? Or it's not skipping? Is this better than usual or worse than usual? I changed my Nvidia Broadcast version. That might be why. You can see. Yes. Mostly. Sometimes almost simply. I think I did turn on Music Nations. Yeah. Why is the FPS counter not working? What did I do to break the FPS counter? Oh god, I broke all the counters except for the RDP one. What the hell? I don't know when and how I broke this. It used to work fine. It's skipping and all. That's good. Finally. So yeah, Nvidia Broadcast is a terrible software. That where only seemingly some versions work. And I guess I finally have a better one. A working version. That is awesome. It's a bit of networking. Yeah, even here all the counters are missing. What the hell? Are you sick? Or tired? I am very sick. Hello, Weusel. Hello, Teatime. Okay. So. The idea for the Overworld is that the Overworld is the entirety of Yoshi's Island. My microphone is not there. Happy Anniversary. Anniversary? It's our wedding anniversary. Oh, I forgot. It's okay, I forgot too. There you go. Hi, chat. Did your dad just call you about our anniversary? Yes. I also forgot. I didn't even feel bad about it. That's okay. Maybe we'll do something fun for our anniversary. Who knows? Well, you're also sick. So maybe we'll leave it to another day. Yes. I will see you later, chat. Bye-bye. Want to wait for the side-courses? Yeah, we're doing the Overworld first and then through the Overworld we'll have ideas for side-courses. You know what? We'll use Photoshop today. Today we're being fancy for this. Yeah, it's our three-year anniversary. We married three years ago. And for our anniversary I have a brownie. No way. Years passed. Time is a never-ending march. Who could have known? And 22nd of every 22. Yep, all twos. Easy to remember date. I'm going to use Yoshi's Island map as an inspiration. That is a brownie. Let's get the general outline. I did already have a bunch of Overworld parts written down that I want in there. Let me just talk about this. The first part of the Overworld is going to be a beach-side cliff. I'm thinking a cliff because a cliff feels very limiting. There's going to be large intimidating walls. You're going to feel like you can only be on a small part of Yoshi's Island. Which is what we want. Then I want there to be a jungle path that goes through the island. This jungle path goes by the Bowser Mines which you can't enter. So we're edging the player a little bit telling them there's something to discover there later. Star Power and Minecart that you can't go in because you don't have the stars for it. Then we have part 3 which is the other side of the beach. We have the bottom, beach 1 path, beach 2 here. Because I want the entrance for the ghost ship, the zoo and the ice cap level via a puzzle. Part 1 path, part 2 and then part 3 I also want them to be this part here. So you can get a full 360 view of the island. This kind of needs to be a one way. Then inside the island I also want a jungle. There's going to be like a clearing in the jungle with like a lake or something and that's where the Yoshi's spend the majority of their time. We got some cliffs around a buchtung. I'm not sure what the English word is. Oh, bay. Yeah, something kind of like this. Oh there will be so many trees by the way. Part 6 Part 7 I was thinking there should be broken castles. So you know how in Mario World 2, Yoshi's Island you kind of like destroy the castles. I'm thinking it would be very cute if Yoshi's Island was still like loaded with broken castles in some places. We can have them be all around the island. I'm thinking one overworld as the super happy tree. Maybe that's going to be combined with something. A beach side plot. Again, we need these kind of everywhere for the 360. Does Mario World have Yoshi's Island? I think so. Oh. What is this? What is this AI overview? Wait, what? No, that's... It's just like one world in Mario World. Yoshi's Island thing. I'm not sure actually. Wait, do you have to account for eventual side levels with all the fragile deco? Yes, yes, definitely. I already have a video on that. I have a few side levels marked and I'm sure there will be plenty of space to just add new side levels as well. Because the overworld is so important what we're going to do, we're going to plan it and we're going to make a 2D sketch here and we're going to make a 3D sketch with all the double entrances drawn in. I'm hoping to beta test that just a sketch so we can still adjust the sketch, see how people explore it and then from there slowly finalize it over time. So just the first world is that? That's what I thought too. So this is Yoshi's Island in Super Mario World. I'm thinking the overworld will be around four times the size of Super Mario 64 Biobak. I think that's a good size here. We have a lot more side levels so I think it makes sense. I also want pipes around the overworld everywhere. Because there are going to be pipes once that's open, or well, on both sides of the block with like a cork and you can only pull the cork from one side  and then once you pull it you can just quick warp around the world. Hello, Asko. I think a waterfall would be really cool. That's why I want a waterfall area with some rivers. Yeah, true, Biobak. I mean, that's like that in Mario 64 too, right? They're all kind of shoehorned in. Yeah, Zayn already has a lot of sketches about how Mario goes through the levels. One thing I definitely want in this is unique ways to discover level entrances. Dude, I'm doing nasty being human meat sack stuff today. I apologize. I agree, the painting can make it a lot less jarring. Another beach sidewalk. I'm not a fan of just beach sidewalk but we kind of need something to go around the island. Volcano area, cloud area and I'm thinking an underwater cave system as well that you can enter from various parts. That being said I envision the actual shape of the island to be let's see we need something like this there to be some boardwalk like this so is there any razor tool here somehow? I think I will need that. There it is. Part two.  I might need different colors for all of this. Do you envision small areas or one big area with everything in it? I think small areas is better because you can shift the vibe more naturally. Yeah, I'm having like 14 small areas here. That's what I'm thinking so far. Still it would be like the beach section have a path through the jungle this is going to be undecipherable if I do it like this unfortunately. Course 15 is finished, yeah. I need a better way to do this. I'm not sure what if we do one main shape for the whole thing and then for each sub-area we do like an additional layout. Because we're mostly on their own level so I can see that, yeah. I don't know, man. So, okay, I think what we should do is first get the outline roughly right. We got this the sidebar here we got another beach here what's in the north we have a waterfall and rapids so this is the side of the waterfall and some rivers so maybe this is the main part here something like this is the shape oh that almost looks like a Yoshi what if we made the island the shape of a Yoshi yes or no the island needs to be the shape of a Yoshi I need something simple like this I don't know if this is the island shapes I feel like it should be returning to the same island yeah but have you ever looked at Yoshi's island it's like so stylized I can't really tell what's going on here like we can't Make this into an overworld, right? Besides, this is already not the same island as this. Same shape as which one, this one or this one? This one, I don't know about this one though, it would be so flat if we went by this, I don't think it'd be very fun. When we set an island, it is island-shaped, and the more degrees we're in, the slower the model is going to be, I don't think that works. But no, this island is going to be so big and in so many parts that you're not going to really see the outline anyway, you would only figure this out if you actually tried to draw the map. How do I rename this? How do you rename a layer? Sure, SuperM, the whole overworld is just that one track, by double-clicking the name. Usually you rename stuff by slowly double-clicking it, and that's what I tried. So part one would be very much just like beach here, and then I was thinking we want to cliff this in, so it really feels like you're stuck here, like something like this, maybe? And then there would be random opportunities to jump up here, and there would be dunes, and as you went inwards, it would get grassier, something like that. And we need a river here, so that you can get to DinoDinoDomain. So the river would probably run through the island like so. Maybe the river should start at the ocean, like so. Maybe that's cooler. No, we're completely remaking the overworld. Something like that. The thing that I was planning by the way was that you initially don't even start on Yoshi's Island, right, so you have like the area to learn about stuff. Like you would start with a small tutorial section basically, that's just marketing to a ship. So the plan is Bunny Brushwoods, we're just going to have a burrow entrance, would be somewhere in here. Probably very obvious here. C1. The C2 entrance would be here, there would be a boat on a dune, and every time you collect a star, the boat slides further towards the river, and you jump on the boat and you get into course two. Yeah, it's coal, I'm eating pure coal, it cleans your stomach. And the grotto entrance would have to be on here somewhere. But the grotto entrance, I have no idea what we would do to make this actually like fun to enter. For the grotto entrance, what do we do here? Is there some secret method or do you just get it? After some stars. I think we need to think about a mechanic that we can put onto things, that makes it so that stuff unlocks after amount of stars. Because if we have to think of something that just randomly happens when we collect like stars, I don't think it's going to be very good. I think that would be hard locks with stars. Yes, it's definitely a mine shaft. Some kind of barrier we can move. The original game just had doors. Obviously we can't put doors here, we need something else. Oh no, Mario, it's terrible. Bowser has put locks all over Yoshi's Island. You know what I mean? Big Bowser doors. Oh my god, hello, yes, definitely jump into minecart. I'm thinking about how we make it so that the player knows the area. We have to collect some amount of stars before they get in there. By locking every single issue. We can definitely do something with evil Bowser. Oh, well, I mean, since this is Yoshi's Island, Kamek could also be there. We could be like, Kamek, put this magic barrier here, and we need to pile up this many stars to get through it. How do we do a magic barrier? Yeah, I think that would be easiest, it's our... Paper Mario stuff. Let me google that. It does feel very cheap, that's why I don't like that either. Eggs are fruit. What do other games do? Mario Galaxy? It just restores power to the flying ship. Well, that's simple. Mario Odyssey? Mario Odyssey just doesn't do anything, right? It just tells you to collect this many things. Or it's like, no, you have to restore power to the ship so the ship can fly further. Maybe having a global level and locking mechanics is not good for placements. That's true, but also, how else are we going to lock course 3 and course 2? Moons act as fuel, and that's why you can travel faster or further. That doesn't make any sense. Little puzzles. I do like the idea of them being locked with little puzzles, but even with them being locked with little puzzles, you still need to lock them by stars also somehow, right? Having a bunch of Yoshis opens it. Hmm. I mean, I like that, but what do we- Do we say, like, every time you get a star, you save a Yoshi? Yoshi's Island? Did the island in this game look anything like it did on the title screen for Yoshi's Island? A little bit. I was thinking, um, to have it look more like Mario Party in 3. This one here. I like this. Less man-made constructions and more- Hello, Caleb. This is very cute, I think. I don't think that's true. You know, it's like, you come to the island and you get, like, five stars and suddenly another Yoshi appears? I think that's a little weird. I'm not sure yet, Mittens. Okay. You can do the spiral thing where the Yoshis are locked into their eggs and you have to collect stars to, like, unlock them from the eggs. But that's literally just stealing from Spyro. Does the brownie taste like chocolate? It depends on the way things take place. I can do a lot of stuff, of course. Yes, that's true. But at least you, like, know that it happens. If you just collect five stars and a Yoshi shows up, I think that's more jarring than anything. Right, half the advantage of having, like, a barrier that says you need 10 stars is that when you're at eight stars, you know I just need to collect two more stars. Images of Yoshis appear at random intervals. I think that's a little jank. One entrance block with, like, a gift and rocks can work, too. Okay, but how does the player know how many stars they need to collect? That's my main issue here. Well, I think the first recursive story doesn't need to be locked with stars. I think it's enough if, like, course one is open right away and course two and three require some puzzle to figure out. But also, like, then the area to the next part would need to be locked somehow. Then we need to think about that. Hello, Vextrove. Remember when I explained why you need 10 stars to open one door in Mario 64 anyway? No, they say Bowser's put a magic seal on it. And you know you need 10 stars. That's, like, the main thing. You just know you need to collect Yoshis and you don't know how many Yoshis or how many stars you need to get a Yoshi to appear. Doesn't work. So, yeah, that would be a lot more reasonable. So, okay, the easiest thing I'm thinking of right now is that in front of course three there would be mice that mine the rocks. And they say something like, man, I'm feeling so weak. If only I had the power of five stars I could do this. Yeah, I would be fine with that too, Biobak. That's kind of what it's like in the demo, Teton. That doesn't help. So it doesn't solve the issue. That's funny, Clayman. Someone can simply be over the ground finding two pillars. Yes, something like it. Like I said, I was thinking there would be a boat here and you put the boat in the water somehow. Yeah, so that's saying about this. That's what we'll do. So, this temple is on top of a river, right? No, I got abducted to the Yoshi Land. I guess it's a little weird to appear here when you go into a boat first. Let's hide in the waterfall. Come on, Link, da-da-da. Yeah. We could definitely change the back wall here to have the river just flow out that way. Oh no, Biobak, is it that nasty? Biobak, what do you think about the idea of, like, make this a true river, open up the backside here, make it go into a cave, and then the entrance to Course 2 could be like a water cave. I think that would add a lot of placeness to this, especially if this river that the temple here is on goes through the entirety of Yoshi's Island, and you, like, see the river over and over, and it's all the same river. We could add these same piranhas in this level to the overworld. How cool would that be? I think that would be incredibly cool. Weird the waterfall doesn't come out of a wall what does it come out of? you have like a quick image so i can maybe see how this works i was thinking the back side here wouldn't be a wall either so i mean it doesn't make sense anyway that water is constantly flowing and the water level isn't rising if it doesn't go out anywhere right that's a little weird i agree tea time i mostly don't see what comes out of okay okay that's workable can we just like make the back so that the water just goes that way and then like into a cave or something and then we can make the level entrance here a cave just so we can make the overworld because otherwise i have no idea what the entrance to this would look like and i think it would make this feel very interconnected the more i think about it the more i hate how that looks like the way it just goes inwards it's kind of nasty looking isn't it i feel like it shouldn't be like this it's because miomeg is talking on twitch i think a little separate cave area would look very cool as an entrance yeah so the exit would be it would be a cave here and then maybe inside the island there's like a river that goes against you and you can't go in there and it's like we need two stars to power this boat here to actually make it past the rapid current you know what i mean i think that's a banger idea i think that's a certified banger what what is going on here bro it's losing it oh my god the parameters are so annoying they attack way too much i'm going to turn them down right now that's the power board i don't know man you need to you need to power up with something yeah i'm fine with a puzzle here too i'm just thinking about the level entrance like we turn the back wall of that into something and then there's a river here and maybe you can't swim up the river because of the strong current you need something to make it past i'm fine with that too banger the admittance i wish video games had thought about that before hello ayahuasca so course three we do have the entrance course two we're still not sure i just don't want players to immediately have two levels to choose from i want them to be in course one first what's your bathroom also there seems to be denoising one kilohertz and five kilohertz that removes slightly too much voice that must be nvidia broadcast a big imposing temple door in the cave would fit nicely so okay you're thinking instead of just there being a river here there would be a temple door inside the cave so we have a cave opening here with the river and you can swim up the river which serves as a nice intro for the swimming as well and then inside there would be a temple door that you open with stars or something where you have to do a puzzle but don't still risk players entering course two at first instead of course one you what if the only way to get in there is to use one of marsley moves so you need to do the tutorial in course one first i think that could work you continue yeah you're right okay so let's have the river go over here and um fuck how do you make a river in the temple door wouldn't a temple door like destroy hello x-links i think we need the river to be done course two for all the stuff in the temple to work that's the idea awesome mario oh let me give you a one star on the unblock the entrance to the cave hmm i don't think i mean isn't the story still though that all the yoshis are kidnapped except the sleepy one because he like slept through his own kidnapping grass no usd uh it's fine the one issue i have with making this a temple door entrance is that when we have a temple door here it's gonna block the river unless we make the river be like at the bottom and you can't swim up the river and then the temple door is right above it yeah no i am not against the temple door i'm just against locking out the river i think the river is such a cool idea that really brings everything together we could even have it work so that course two has a backside entrance if we do this imagine how cool that would be to end these two quotes too that would be really cool let's see how can we lay this out in a way that the temple door wouldn't block the river and metal rain vertically under the temple door which i can still throw through yeah i think we do something like that then let me get my cave painting cut out got anything let's just move temple um wait not gate yes this is great well it doesn't say great actually also don't say great oh i was thinking we have a lighthouse here this is kind of the image i had for the part one i don't know why a lighthouse i just really wanted a lighthouse i thought it would look cool for now it's just an idea lighthouse here we are Josiah so this is the first part now okay there's one thing i don't like about this and that this is this is three courses just for the first part of your world it's a little long um three stars with nothing happening other than opening course three and two so that's something i don't really like maybe i would make more sense if course three was in a different part and you'd be able to go to the next part earlier i think i would like the better let's move course three so okay next we need the entrance to part two so part two is going to be like a hiking path that goes through the island to the west side i don't know if it's going to be something with the lighthouse yet i'm hoping to make the lighthouse accessible and if i can't do it then i'll probably remove it we don't want chef cough scan or whatever it was called also for the overworld it's very important to me that if you can see it as a player then you can go there so i want the player to experience like every single inch of yoshi's island in the end it's blue background because it's water okay think about what opens the jungle path okay this one definitely needs to be star locked though there's there's no way this can't be star locked but it can be locked to like four stars or so and the spaghetto so it's a double anniversary yo thank you for the 48 months today is my wedding anniversary by the way i just found out they would be nice the overworld is one big level but it's going to be multiple areas in game so how does this even work um it would probably be like wait like a clearing here wait I can't, I can't find an image ah, like this, that's how the entrance would make an entrance ah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then these rocks can be destroyed with the bomb cap at some point and need somewhere else I like that that's a very cool way of doing it I don't know why I didn't think of that there we go just send them over all right so then I did a bunch of sketches for this as well over the overworld she was also thinking about bunny rushford's entrance here I think this looks beautiful we got koopa waveco for the surfer dude we got koopa carnival with a cutout bowser we got gulgar galleon we got dino dino land dino dino land I kind of want like a cave that changes time as you go I don't know it'd be very cool the zoo barrio won't let you in so you'll have to find like a secret entrance to the zoo I think that would be very cool lofty lumber leaps I'm not sure about this one yet the beat yoshi yeah there's some cute stuff in here Let me start this image here in a bioexcent. This is important. All right, that opens the possibility to put something behind there, which is very good. Let me also note down for local C2, the start and spawn site needs an exit. Very important. Do we have an idea for a cloud cap secret? I'm not sure. The idea for it is definitely that it's above Koopa Wave Cove, because it has similar enemies. So far, I'm really liking how this is coming together. This is already going better than I thought it would be. What the fuck is this? A tooth? Does Yoshi have teeth? Oh, God. He definitely has teeth here. You put teeth in there? I put teeth in there? Why did I put teeth in his mouth? Well, he actually does have teeth. God, there's so much text in here. Also, I have an idea that whenever you collect a star and there's Yoshis around, they cheer for you. I think that's a super cute idea. Anyway, jungle path. We can't just be like, oh, it's too scary. You need four stars to warp past. That is too stupid. But I definitely want it to be four or five stars here. Maybe four. This is for the second part of the overworld. So what I want to happen next is a path here that's somewhat jungly in vibe. And the path is going to go like so, basically. Something like that. And this path needs to be locked with a star requirement. So island shaped like a Yoshi head? Yes. I think it's fun. But it's going to be very difficult to tell that it's shaped like a Yoshi head just from looking at it. We can make our switch too. I don't care. I love that a switch too doesn't exist. Why would I want to buy new hardware? Yeah, I have no LSD right now. Ah. Anything to learn here? Not really. Anything on the island you see too pink? No. Yo? Is that a joke? What do you mean? Oh, you mean the Yoshi drawing smell? Well, I guess it kind of is. We could move this further to the right if you really want, but I don't think it makes a difference. Okay. The first major overworld upgrade or progress thing can definitely or needs to be locked with a star somehow. And we can use bullshit magic stuff. Yeah, I think. I think that's fine because you can feel the villain's influence right away. Yeah. So if it said something like, oh, Bowser has blocked this. We need this many stars to get past here. I think that's a good thing. We need to give the player the initial motivation to get stars anyway. I think they are going to do it even without the motivation, but I want them to have like an in-game reason to. Another big Bowser from the demo. Yeah, I think that is the correct way to do it. I don't like how crap this feels here, but I do need the cliffs here. Maybe we might just have to erase a little bit here. Star. Let's go with the P2. There we go. Okay. So, okay. That's good. That's good. We have part one here. We're going to make a big path here. And then we're going to have part three like here. And I want part three and part one to be connected with its pipe. So that after you go through the P2 part. That after you go through part two to part three, you can open this pipe. And now you have a quick warp from one to three right away. So that if you make progress, save the game, beat the game, you don't have to walk through part two again. You know what I mean? So in a way, some of the overworld parts will be anticipatory. They won't really be there as an overworld, but rather as like a thing where it's like, oh shit, I unlocked a new area. I'm excited to see what's going on. And then like the whole thing is just edging. You know how like TV shows, when they reveal like a big thing, they always go, oh, oh, what's going to happen? What's going on? That's what some of parts of this world are going to be like. And part two will be exactly that. Edging for part three. And after the edging is done, having the quick warp from part one to part three is perfect. So that runs as one ending. I don't actually remember what the ending is. I kind of watched it like in just one go. I didn't even notice as one ending in this two starting. Or wait, is that where she publicly speaks? Is that it? And when she's alive, oh, I see. Yeah. Edging. You know exactly what I mean. Edging. Edging. Edging it. So Bartu has to rainfall proto with the mice that ones stars. And the entrance to free, I kind of, I'm not a fan of the idea that you unlock three parts of courses at the same time. So again, we need to gatekeep girl, boss, girl, lie, whatever to play. And you'd be unlocking the rainbow grotto and the ghost ship and the zoo at the same time. So what a zoo, we already said that we're going to put in some kind of puzzle here. Maybe you need to unlock the ice to get there, or maybe for the ghost, should you need to unlock the ice cap? Something like that. What does your Mario AI, I'm not sure I want to see this. Apps for unlocking level when I'm actually going down time. Yeah, that's a good paradigm. Why aren't you doing speedrun tactics? Cause I'm enjoying it and I don't want to do the whole time, but look, it's gone. Now what makes me sad, my Twitter got so popular that I can no longer schizo post on Twitter. So now I have to go schizo post on LinkedIn and those who know, you know, right. So those are mines. We can just do whatever we did in the first overworld where it's like 20 stars, activate the mine cart. But that's still lame. Cause 15 is fully done. Have I ever shown you guys the finished battle section? I don't know.  I don't know.            I don't know. I can take a quick look. I think it turned out amazing. Actually, bro is yapping. So this is the Yoshi Newton's house. So I'm thinking we're going to have these all over the retro section. Xena's drawing them right now to kind of look like a rainbow board from Mario Kart. We have the Goombas from Mario 64. They are so retro. We got the improved wooden board. It's a retro road. It is only retro 64. Meow, meow, meow, cat death. Oh, that's supposed to say one, one, one. Oh, well. Then we got the merry-go-round section. All the levels in order. Nice bridge. Oh yeah, half the bridge is missing. That's fine. I don't remember why I removed half the bridge. We definitely still need a new fire texture there. And I don't like that this interrupts the music. The ice bridge was fucked up. There was an ice bridge? I'd like to not fall down, please. Thank you. It should be ice level. Like here? Or are you playing RTYI or something? We got the wet-dry-wild section. And now we got the cool, uh, the Total Mountain section. We got kind of a difficult jump here. But I definitely could have made it. We got some easier jumps here. We got a jump that you can do with your patient here. How much memory is this level taking? The side area here? Not much. Oh, yeah, I know. I said I removed half the bridge. Right there. I know. I responded to you saying that as though that is what you meant. And then you said something else that made me think that's not what I meant. We even got the wooden carpet here. The wooden carpet is wooden. It's made out of wood. It isn't only up. It's mostly up. True. And then Yoshi. Mario, it then really you? And it's been so long since our last. Rancho didn't really mind if I waited here, but I'm just about giving up. Is it true you're looking for the power stuff? Let me help you out We again Yeah, I think that's gonna be a really cool area once all here is done with the extra pictures too You I guess Yoshi has known a cool people because it runs on an n64 You Can do like insane tricks here like this is a shortcut And I'm sure you can Yes, but your shortcuts here It's just how long Jolly Roger Bay, okay Anyway You We got the mice mining here Yeah, the music's that I will still need music I was gonna ask my dupe to like make a remix of all the more 64 songs There's this video You Another with the other remix kind of like this This section You know what I mean, I think this would be like a good angle check this out Bob on battlefield You Yeah, I don't know You You This is illegible You I don't want to try videos. I want to get stuff done I'm not reacting to random videos. Yes, we're trying to get work done So, okay, we also need to bow the mind entrance I'd have to be also somewhere here. This is this is a very preliminary Of course there will be actual platform again and stuff like that And let's go jettison You So this also needs an entrance to Part four Wait, it doesn't make any sense needs an entrance to part five But five is the jungle thing, you know, I'm German You So five would be here with like a lake in the middle You You Well, anyway, let's do part three first Do we do cliffs again We need this to be limited somehow and I think this might be our best option You I'd free needs to ghost ship in the zoo and the ice cap. Oh, okay. This is a huge one. Yeah, this is a fish Maybe you want this to go a bit higher The ghost ship here we have the zoo and the ice cap level for the ice level The entrance was like a puzzle Where and they would tell you hey go here and then do free backflips and grump and get a star Hello is uh, I'm glad you're enjoying the awkward silence Why spend that was Yoshi so graphically damaged, what do you mean? Oh Do you mean the red lines on it that people were saying looks like blood that was not meant to be blood It was meant to be just like, you know, the curse taken over Definitely have to change the color so it looks less like blood Hello rocket man Yeah, that's a penis you got me Don't ghost ship the ghost ship would be a long boardwalk and There would be fuck in front of it So probably the easiest way to do this would be you have a bit of the Fox amount and that is So maybe we should think of a puzzle where you clear up the fork I Super happy tree. I was thinking of adding modulus as the intense alpha for help You So the ice cap honestly could be used for anything here The name stone, okay now that you just broke the same word again, I absolutely know what you're talking about The only way you could have been more helpful is if you just said it louder Oh at first I thought you were bullshitting but then you said the same thing again, but louder and now I believe you You know how normal people believe in sessions work The render is pretty good BoB arrangements if he wants to give it a try I'm open to it But I think but who wants to make the whole OST But I'm not a hundred percent I Also have this weird thing where I do not want to reach out to people and ask for help Because a lot of the time I feel like I'm gonna say all this actually isn't up to the quality standards I expect or just like changes I want to have me and like when you ask someone for help and then you tell them actually your help and it sucks That always feels like super bad for everyone involved I feel like if I ask someone for a favor, I can't just say actually you're too bad a job You Thanks, this sucks But if you had to somehow make with the beer to get rid of the fog You Yeah, people love to say by gas can be chooses well, it's like You need to ensure quality. You have to be chooser. So I guess you just can't be a beggar If beggars can be choosers then choosers can't be beggars That's a bang on published one posting it on LinkedIn You Actually, is that even true logically speaking you are a beggar you're not allowed to be a chooser That means if you're a chooser you can be a beggar so is that true am I stuck my brain is stuck what's going on? You It's a banger post either way You Yeah, I don't know I mean he's doing great work and being a great help so I want to respect those wishes in that regard You All right nurse for we could put wind what if there's windmills and you power the windmills somehow wait, isn't there like The wind machine Like a thing your ground pound and wind comes out But that's that's too simple we can't just put like if the thing there the ground pound and wind comes out That's too easy. I don't want to do that No, that sucks Are you clear to fuck You Dude every time I look at this game I get so sad. This is such a cool animation and it's like paper marker Can you imagine being the person that made this and then like the whole rest of the design completely shits the bed and your game sucks because like They have really stupid ideas for how to design the game Sucks man Around the balancing. Yeah If they just remove the battles entirely the game would be so much better dude that needs to be a mod Imagine someone makes a bot of me Mario color splash, but you win every battle instantly Dude yes I should make that What I'm gaming it's the only solution I'm to get to work. I need to do it You Hey, but Mario has some in Milsim, Yoshi's Island have any Oh, yeah, of course I would find my own thing Is there any winded here You You  Is what I gains a screen cookie I never noticed. They look kind of poopy. Ah, you can get away with that. Interesting You I'm a cannon bees gold course level could be fun. I have not thought about that, but it is a very cool idea You I think this map looks cool. It's just the gaze that look weird The music with it too, dude, this is actually kind of a bad man Is there a wind level You I still will nothing about the zoo to The way you open the zoo needs to be like messing with Mario somehow. He's outside. He said no I'm not letting you in and then we do something and suddenly he no longer checks the gate something like that You So my original idea for in the ghost ship entrance is that it's foggy and the fog just clears up time You You're not that Steve I'm gonna write down your idea just for the fun of it and maybe I will do it one day It's going into my side levels idea ideas list Because it's a very cool idea. Yeah, we actually do want like a lot of side levels and what you're describing sounds like it's very easy and quick to make and to also very fun experience so it's perfect. I'm very creative too. Anyway, clears up over time, don't like it. The idea was it's foggy and the fog just automatically clears up but that was the original idea. And for the zoo, the idea is Vario is there, you just need 9999 coins to get in, but then you find like a secret entrance somehow. For side level, oh, the side level idea is a golf course that is based on cannons. So you would be like a golf ball. For just one level, I think that's perfect, with just one star. That's one of the comps. What? Man, I don't want to steal a comp submission idea. Maybe we can't do that then. Gary's goofy golf. This is from 2021. Let's see this. But this is not actually using cannons, so I think it's fine. Yeah, it's fine. It's not based on cannons, it's different enough. I don't think I steal any cogwag ideas. Hello, Judy. Okay. So, new course 5 entrance, probably to be around, or course 4 is what it is now. Yeah, that's different enough, I'm not thinking. I wouldn't feel like I'm stealing any. I mean, the idea is technically stolen from a Twitch chat, not from a comp pack. Just so people stop saying it looks like a dong, which I don't know which part of this makes it look less like a dong. Y'all have weird dongs if you think any of this looks like a dong. You should get that checked out. Dude, I love these Google image results. Hmm. Hmm. How do you clear out a bug? Surely there's like, roster. How do people, why is everyone talking about cars? It's all weird. Gimmick side levels. Yeah, yeah, I do want that. The side level Esa's making is also very gimmicky. It's based on, well, actually it's kind of the same as our scatterbug hack we made. It's very slidey. I do want the side levels to be gimmicky. Yeah. True. I'm not 100% on 2.5D, but we can probably make it work with the extended RTY IMO set. I think the biggest issue with 2.5D levels in R64 was the lack of click transfer so long. Yeah, I'm not feeling like listening to an OST right now. Yeah. How do you call the glares that ships anchor on? I don't think it's a boardwalk.  Does that work for ships? Shit. I like the idea of making this very raggedy so that you step on it and parts of it fall apart and dock. Yes, that's the word. I'm going to go to your home and eat six brownies and it is going to ruin your life. You'll no longer be the best at anything. Did you know that MrBeast has the world record for most people dropped through a trapdoor at the same time? I've really been trying to break that record, but he managed to best me. I wish I was capable of that. We'll make this more raggedy until we have ideas then. This could be like almost floating parts like this where you step on it and it kind of moves around. It could require the ice cap to get there, but then you need the ice cap every time and that also sucks. We could make it so that there's a thing underground and it's like anchored down or something and you have to unanchor it and then you can walk on it to walk to the level. Damn Kyle, I don't know if I can do A or give up right there. Pierre? That sounds like the French word for it. Wait, what? That's new. Precious. Precious. I have a buck. Oh no! I save-stated and he knew. Hold on, we can't enter the level right now. Can we send a wrapping bomb? Oh, okay. We can punch. Not really sure how to fix that bug though, but yeah, that sucks. Yeah, I like the idea that there's something anchored down and you have to unanchor it. Are there metal enemies? There's tap-taps. CSGG? Don't worry, the overload's gonna be great. Are there any other metal enemies? No. So what if there's tap-taps weighing down the dock? We have to get rid of them somehow. Because with them on there, you can't jump to where your safe is. I think that would work. Oh, that's good to know, Ben. I think I fixed that in an update, but I'm not 100% sure. We've seen the bug report before. How about you beat tap-taps? I don't think you can beat them normally. Lure them off? That's also lame. Maybe that just shouldn't be tap-taps. Maybe that's just a terrible puzzle. There are dogs here, too. Oh, worms. Worms would be great. Worm-blocking your way? The boat could be sunken and you could re-float it like Mario 64. Oh. I kind of like that, but the ship itself is not really designed as though it was sunken. So in that sense, I don't like it. There's fire everywhere, and it's all dry. Hmm. The ghost ship doesn't follow reason. But it being a ghost ship is a good hint. Okay, wait. Listen to this. What if the ship is here, but it's like a shadowy fix, and you have to go into the lighthouse that is down here. And in the lighthouse, you point the light at the ship. And that makes the ship visible and breaks through the fog. And now you can actually enter it. I think that's a banger idea. I think that is the idea. That's what we should be doing. What did I do? I fucked up my thing. Shit. Where's my layout list? Oh, fuck. Okay. Okay. Oh, no, I'm making it worse. I'm making it worse. Oh, my God. Bro, anyone know how to open the layout list again? There we go. Safety. All right, let's note that down. Okay. Hello, Skyloft.  Welcome to this. Hello, Skyloft. This is funny. We can still change it if we want. Yeah, I'm really happy with that. Now you have to, you go through here, you unlock this, you see course 5, but you can't enter it, and then with the Lytos you can finally enter it. I'm very excited about having a secret area discovered by putting the Lytos at it. Well you already do that with course 5. Or what do you mean? You mean like two areas are found that way? I'm not sure how we're envisioning this right now. Kinda malarkey. It's inspired by it, but not entirely based off of it. I think the first part of the overworld alone is only as big as the Mars and Diana overworld, 64s. Could be a secret underground one since players are going to focus on the boat. Hmm. It's the second one. You mean like another one that you point the light at? Like exactly like that? I don't know if I like that. I was thinking in the Lytos it would be best to just have like a switch that you step on and then the light rotates in like a cutscene and shows course 5. So you wouldn't actually be like pointing the light, you would just be hitting a switch and the switch points the light. Pointing the light actually and having the player have like a 3D view of the whole level, that's going to be a problem. It'd be easier for me if I were able to just make the player hit this and then start the cutscene with the camera like being here, looking at the Lytos and then the light pointing at course 5. But I actually do want secret levels to be all over the place. So I want the cloud cap, for example, to be entered here somehow with a cannon. Yeah, I see what you mean. It's just kind of unreasonable. Yeah, I'm pretty sick. Alright, now for Various Zoo. How will we make the player enter the zoo? I was thinking entering the zoo required the ice cap and the ice required you to solve a puzzle. And we do want that to mess with Wario somehow. If the zoo is near no water, we can just have a slight entrance here. But just from the way that the zoo looks, to me the zoo looks more like the areas around here. I think that's fine. I think we can make it work here. Thanks for watching! Oh, actually I got the course numbers wrong. It looks like the zoo is course 5 on my list now for some reason. I don't know why, but I'm sure the past case has thought about this. I'll just copy this over. What if you just had to pay Wario off once? Wouldn't that feel bad to actually give Wario money? I think it kind of would. It could do something stupid like you have to dress up once and you can go in there. Dress up as a penguin or something. Otherwise go back in. Or, what could also be fun, is if you had to lure a chain chomp there somehow. And that's how the chain chomp got into the zoo in the first place. And then you freeing the chain chomp during the zoo level is even more fun. It's also these monkeys in Yoshi's Island. Maybe we can do something with that. That's going to be such a banger overworld. The way it's going so far. Holy shit, this is going to pull the whole game together. This is going to be such a banger overworld.   Let me unbounce someone. Looks like entries restricted by the smaller ingredients. You need to be guarding at least 20 stars for Wario to get in. Oh, I like that. I will write that down for now. Thank you for watching! Oh, none of these zoos make me think of anything. I could also have it be attached to the water here. Actually, no, we can't. What would be kind of neat to do is if you could always enter Course 5, but you need like the ice cap to really do it. To get the ice cap, you really kind of need to beat Bowser 1. I think that would be kind of a neat dynamic. I'm a little worried right now, actually, that you might not go into Course 3, and then you go all the way here past Bowser 1, not able to enter Course 5, not able to enter Course 4, and you're just like, what the fuck do I do? So maybe there needs to be the cloud cap level here soon. Yeah, the cloud cap level needs to be pretty obvious, I think. Just like an open cannon you can jump into right here in Part 4. What am I going to do to... I have binged a lot of your videos about optimizing for code, and a lot of the decisions you motivate me in part on programming knowledge. Yes, I'm glad to hear that. My throat is starting to hurt from talking on stream. It's sick. Yeah, so... What the fuck with Mario? Right now, I just started on page 1 and then kept reading on the documentation. Just try all the hotkeys. It takes like a week to get through, but then you can do it. Maybe it's better if Course 5 just has a heart star limit instead of a trick. Course 3 has a star limit, Course 4 has a trick. Course 5 with a heart star? Maybe not. But I wouldn't know a good idea for a star limit anyway, so maybe a trick is better. Maybe you literally just jump over the gate. Like, there's a plane to get up here, and you just jump over it. Maybe that is the best. But then it wouldn't really feel like Course 5, it would feel like Course 4. Yes, Course 4 needs a proper unlock right now. Course 5, you just jump into it. This would also be the perfect place for Aza's slide level to go, around here. So I will just note that down. Aza? Okay. If this level isn't too difficult. When did Zayna write down, or draw for the level edits here? Ah, it's just a wooden gate in the booth. Maybe you have to break the wooden gate once. Maybe that's the solution here. You have to do something to break the gate. Maybe like roll a boulder into it or something. Easy to make a mountain up here, and then a thingy rolled down. But again, super, super obvious. Rolling a boulder is just too easy. Palm trees and fruit here too, can't forget about that. Bumps here. What the hell? So blue. That looks so flat. Is this what it looks like in the first Mario Party? Okay. Let's see. I'm disappointed by what I'm seeing on Google again. Dude, what? The bottom one looks so much better. Is this the N64 one? This one has no soul compared to this one. Oh my god, this is so much better. Is this actually what it looked like in the first Mario Party? Or the second? Or the third? That's a crazy difference. Okay. I feel like I'm at a point where I'm staring at it anymore. I'm not going to get any closer to a resolution here. So I think for today, it's best to call it quits. And I can think about it some more while I'm not streaming. So that's what we'll do. I will see you guys in the next stream, which maybe is going to happen on Tuesday, but I'm not 100% sure. So until then, bye.
