Did you know that there's grass outside yes I have heard of that before did you know I have a very funny funky collection of socks yes I heard you hello me dark get model get model so I was working on this before stream okay my speakers are the wrong way around I can tell no I'll speed up the animation a bit you don't think it was the wrong way around my speakers were definitely the wrong way around like my IRL speakers not not in game but we have a few issues still that I need to fix you guys want to listen to any specific OST today sounded weird to you too yeah the volume doesn't scale correctly that's what I was working on just now did you try plugging it back in again no yeah so this case should basically never happen anyway let's see how the code runs when I just do this this is called from the original Mario 64 that does not work fine with the mat stack fix I'm pretty sure nevermind it does seem to work for some reason I don't know why it would work that's weird but this might be something that I have to do to offstream because this is a bit too complicated for stream we should be working on the black boss today I can't believe there's a Mario 64 code left well it's heavily edited just the similar it is overhauled it's just not really the functionality is still similar might have to turn the volume on this time hopefully I can play more tonight can I want to so I've made a lot of progress on this fight off stream as usual there's also some sick performance improvement I did off stream did you guys definitely want to see I think I'll make it so that it spawns to the closest edge vertex instead of just always here the star okay if no one's interesting any music I'm gonna listen to the classic Sonic OST just then once a banger hello and the fancy room hello Lilaa yes it reached me to Lilaa YouTube's been blocking the ad blockers wait is that why I'm making so much more money this month possibly wait a second watch ads this month for some reason on YouTube I made so much more money I'll get this it's like twice what I usually make although actually I also have way more watch time and way more views still the views are only increased by like 30% the watch time is increased by like 50% and the income is increased by almost like a hundred percent honestly if it means I make more money I support this ad block thing I don't give a fuck $400 a month I can buy YouTube premium from that am I German yes well I live in Canada right now but I used to live in Germany I grew up in Germany too I think we can finish the boss block today maybe he's going back on his what what no no no no okay you have to there's an important distinction here okay and it's because Emanuel Kant is a fucking asshole and that's what most people don't get there's a difference between me saying I want something this way and me saying I think it'd be good if something was this way how do you learn coding and stuff like in uni no I was literally just born with the ability to code like unironically I was just born and able to program right away just making a funny joke I know but I had to make it very clear that Emanuel Kant is a fucking asshole you shouldn't listen to him he's caused all our problems it's all Emanuel Kant's problem who exactly you don't even know who he is he was a philosopher and for it no in Germany I think in the 18th century he lets the how's the movement called in awakening movements in like the 18th century I don't know how you call it in  hopefully I'm working on a block but you never know what happens okay so everything that's really missing from this Blargg boss fight is that it needs to run away from you no I didn't know any programming languages when I was born but I had the ability to program okay so you admitted that you over explain responses to jokes as a joke and then you see like two days ago you can't trick me wait really you over explain response to jokes as a joke no I don't do that as a joke I just take it serious because what if you are serious okay sometimes when Arthur makes a joke I think it's really funny to take it serious but genuinely I respond to most things as though they were serious because when you make a joke there's also like this little implication of an underlying truth to it right not every joke is like purely fictional and because of that underlying truth that a joke applies I feel like I have to respond to them seriously sometimes okay so our goal right now is to make it so that if you are on the soap the Blargg needs to run away and the Blargg should be running away in the circle here to the direction that is further away from Mario I think so we should get Mario's angle tonight we trapped the Mario inside this room that would be a mr. beast trapped me in this room with this Oil Blargg and told me I get 10 million if I survive I'm taking the deal it can't be that hard to beat I took the hammers and leave the mountains and this is what happens true I wish I was making as much money as mr. beast dude if I had mr. beast money I would just make games forever yeah I guess nothing would really change actually no I would hire more game more people to help me make games we'd be the big company we would just fuck Nintendo yeah what's the distance again yes work they mix chocolate with fruit and that's a crime do it sick idea leader but I would turn them into viruses I wouldn't just buy them turn them into viruses make some money from that and then no one will ever want an ad blocker again instead of a reputation for being viruses you would just compile you it's open source I'm closing the source can't buy an open source project man do you know what happened between open AI and Microsoft I guess it was an open source before but open AI became closed AI real quick just through some Bill Gates money I'm sure there's yeah because they yeah it's a propaganda name company no way it's a research company you don't get it they are a real research company they should have free access to every image online because they're not for profit they're purely research 20 bucks on Gen GPT you know it's for research it's not for profit it's all research what could you be talking about it's all research clearly let's start with 15.5 we're gonna make it so the Blargg goes faster the more damage she has I don't think I'm okay I'm moving him nevermind the moment the entire VC stands going through for no reason wait what I don't think they ever wear open source oh that's cool he's fleeing what if I kept this whale he turns around oh this is perfect it looks good I like it nothing about open AI is open what about the name should make him shake while you're on top of him yeah I couldn't work just animation he should be in pain oh he should just be absolutely suffering while he's being chased well FM always shake but like when you're on top of him we make the animation go faster let's try it make him cry dude it's like when you when you have a cat and you want to put your cat on the bathtub yeah he should be doing that one of him turning to look at Mars sometimes when he runs away he can't left and right like in panic ha I think this is like the base animation and then we add more animation on top of this we even did this like most of the time like now he's running away without Mario being on top of him and then with Mario being on top of him it will look something like this cuz he's taking damage it's funny that cats me I was gonna sound like Mao which means better dude cats in German the phonetics for it is just Mao or meow and the saying bad bad battle and over I've seen cat that says worth links I don't know if you've seen the video cat says n word for some reason but it's out there Which one is that? Lilna? You're trying to get me banned. I've seen someone make their dog racist on YouTube before. Yeah. They were training the dog to react to very bad things. Alright I like this. And now when you're on top. He's so panicky. I like it. Does he look more scared if I do that to his mouth part? Yeah, I think that makes him look a bit sad or like scared. What do you think of the fleeing animation? Looks good. The eyebrows should have had... yeah, that would have been pretty nice. 1, 2, 3, 4. He assumes a liking in the face department. He doesn't really have any other facial expressions I can put on there. Unless I give him like eyebrows he can animate separately but I didn't. What if we made it so that in the level during the first three acts you can kind of see him like driving around in the background sometimes. Like as an easter egg. Maybe it's chilling somewhere. Just use a switch bone. Switch bones are the worst dude. Pretty quick ok solution. No, how the fuck am I supposed to put a switch bone on this? It just... it never works. Switch bones suck in Frost 64. Fuck everything up. I think it'd be better to have like an animation bone on here. And then... Oh god. You'd have to do something like this. I guess that kind of looks sad. But yeah, I don't want to do that right now. Fuck.  I still need to make it so that Thor here damages you somehow. Because that's another bug. It sucks that you can just stand on here right now. Is that the F word? Dude, okay, swears being a bad thing is such an American concept. I don't give a shit. If I have a kid and the kid is four, the kid can't say fucking shit all at once. I don't think my parents will appreciate that. Well, fuck them. Those are my parents! Just a quick send about a response to you? I mean, in fairness, I don't think I'll be as much of a... What do you call it? Much on the swear patrol? Yeah, just a quick send fade out would probably work. What up, Fireback? What up? I think we can speed the Blargg up a little. He was joking. Oh, I didn't show you guys. Actually, did I show you guys yet? We have a new song for the boombox koopas that Baduk made. It's really good. I think your stomp should be eaten up a bit quicker while you're on him. And you should take a bit more damage. Oh, but this is really cool now. This reminds me of the Knuckles fight with King Boom Boom. It's not the last phase at all, you know. That's just where you damage him. You're supposed to do that like three times. And it's supposed to take a lot longer. Basically, the idea is he kind of runs around the field and he does this attack at you over and over. And he shoots waves. And every now and then a piece of soap drops. And you can use the soap to attack him. Still haven't used the cool prim color flashing effect. Oh shit, you're right. I need to add that. Let's add it right now. Someone followed? How do you do it? You just increase the brightness on the prim? Is there no other way to do it? Let me see if I can set this up so it's a bit easier to use somehow. Primitive color, primitive color. Nope. I have to use it like this. Okay, that works. Does he have a GeoASM? Wait, he doesn't need one. Because he's a unique actor. Look, I'm giving my variables names. I can just change the prim. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do. What's that for though? For taking damage. Oh, nice Biobak. Do you have an idea of communicating the player into them attacking the Blargg yet? I think it's pretty obvious. Like, if you get the... If you get the soap... There's nothing else you can do with that. See guys, that's what the setASM node in the armature object properties is for. The armature object? What am I supposed to do with it in the armature object properties? That's not where I need the prim. I don't need the prim before the armature. I need the prim before this specific bone. You see the issue? You should go... When you touch them with the soap, there should be particles. I agree. We already had... Oh, remember that one stream we made just about soap particles? Dude, it's all leading up to this. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I don't know. Do you use prims anywhere else? Yeah, I think so. You don't have to use it. I still don't like it. Okay, so why did you change the... Oh, there's another issue, Lila. If it's somewhere above the chain and it has children, which it's going to have, that sucks. Because I need it below there. Because my G.O.A.S. nodes are not allowed to have children. They're castrated. Okay. No, G.O.A.S. nodes can't... Nope, most of them can't. I don't know why you think that they can't. Okay, so I have two combiner questions. One, using multitex as an example, why do you need to subtract x1 from x0 and b before adding it to d? You don't need to. You can just multiply them. You can do any math formula you want with them. How can G.O.A.S. not have children? What do you mean? I will prove you wrong right now. Clean SM64. Process generated list. It can't have children. What do you mean? The line of code is right here. Yes, I do remember Doki Doki Mario 64. Are you sure? I just showed you the code. I just posted proof. You just posted cringe. You know, I thought the code might... well, it can. I did not know that Fast64 gives you an error for that. Because it doesn't need to. Because it is allowed to have that. It will work just fine. What's your second combiner question, Biobak? The problem with combiners, I guess, is that you need good mathematical intuition to use them properly. Fast64 is not a flashcat. How can G.O.A.S. not have children? Alpha is also white. Then if you add primitive, you add blue to white. And blue plus white is still white. Because white is already 255 in R, G, and B. If you add gray and you add your alpha to 1, then you would have... Let's say gray is like 127. If you want to tell me, 127, 127. Now you add blue, then you can get the blue up to 255. And you get really washed out blue. So you can get 7F, 7FF instead of just gray. But it's still going to look like a washed out blue. But if you subtract your prim and B... Then you multiply it with shadeColorAlpha. Then when shadeColorAlpha is 0, you get just the primitive. And when shadeColor1 is 0, you get just the text0. Maybe I should just show you the math equation here. Let's get out the pastebin. Alright. 0, you get text0 minus prim. Goddamn, I can't fucking type. Multiply with shade plus prim, right? So let's say shade equals 0. You get text0 minus prim. Multiply with shade plus prim. This is 0. So you get just the primitive color. But shade equals 1. Then you get text0 minus prim. Multiply by 1 plus prim. Equals text0 minus prim plus prim equals text0. You see, by doing this combiner, you're changing the color between primitive and text0. It allows you to change the color smoothly between these two. Which leads us to the glowing thing. My second question is, why can't I do text0, 0, 0, shadeColor to add instead of multiply? But it turns out you can, so I'm just... Oh. Well. Oh. That's practical. If it's 2, it's gonna all go back to 2 and it's gonna look overblown. What happens when prim ain't 0 or 1? Well, in our example it was blue, which is 0, 0, 2, 5, 5. So it would just turn into blue. You mean if shade isn't 0, 1? Then it's just gonna be a color between the two. Let's see how this looks. Oh god, the animation's fucked up. Why is the animation so fucked? Oh right fast 64 bucks Lilaa fix this one next please while you're at it look at this I have to turn all these back to zero how stupid is that you know it'd be nice if we got the fast part emote again it looks like a toilet god damn it I remember she remembers hey case can you can you are a visual mode for 3d yes I missed something I don't know what this means I'm sorry he dies once you do 2048 damage to him so he's almost dead here but he keeps glowing forever for some reason do the imagine if just worked on n64 wouldn't that be cool oh because I didn't have brightness I had it and I'm staying well it's my first issue second issue is it doesn't reset to zero oh no wait why does not reset to zero when someone's out I think Marsha be careful but I think getting back onto the platform or not should be a risk management thing you should be allowed to just get back on the platform and proceed to cancel it as well or you just like have it run out hello creep attacks sometimes get the weirdest pings on this card there was one guy that just told me to to go fuck myself I don't know I forgot it's gonna be confusing and frustrating I think so I mean you have to sub before and you do see the soup run out because it gets thinner okay that animation looks mostly good I'm not sure if I fully like it the philosophy guy was insane though yeah that was the worst that was the weirdest thing ever you didn't notice that know that no okay enlighten me so there was a guy that added me on this card and he was like oh you don't think philosophy is a respectable discipline how about you go get raped what the fuck what's that supposed to mean I am very confused about that imagine the struggling player already had one HP dying for something they're barely familiar but yeah when you do the buzzer sound I'm not sure ways to kind of still doing the nonsense and at the end let's see if I can find that maybe I can show you guys this this beautiful message I received from this person it's just like one message I don't know how long ago this was no I can't find them I see two cans of rum wouldn't community player then don't think if they let us open out that is true do you have a p.o. box no unfortunately I do not this heck is gonna run perfectly on FI drive Carlos we did so much optimization to make it possible don't worry we're gonna keep it in 64 compatible I also think button prompts are kind of just like an ugly way to solve issues like this I have one issue with this damage animation and that is that it's only around his mouth and you're gonna mostly be seeing him from the back when this happens so I am gonna slightly ruin biomex model and alpha paint them here I think there should be a benefit hmm I mean that is kind of hard to do like how that even work I also think maybe instead of blue it should go like orange oh no it looks like this oh shit I see the issue shit my back do we need this slight bit of primitive color here I don't think we do but if he turned this color for damage like it was this usually and then when he takes damage it just this but like orange because I think the point one blue doesn't really add much does it well of course it's not gonna be white I'm just thinking about the visuals here can we get a green yeah that's that's what I'm thinking too actually next to geo I just did who do you take me for Lilaa huh it's Shump FF 5e okay gotcha I'm thinking something like this I also think that while the atom state is increasing he should be taking damage continuously just because it would look more consistent that way so that it feels like there's like a consistent amount of hits you're getting and we need to make Mario's soap go smaller faster maybe that puts you in the bunk forward animation when it pops so you're stunned for a moment that doesn't feel like a big downside and that feels like random whether it hits you or not I can't throw you on the roof Lilaa hello Johnny Jorin yeah I had switched platforms because the ads on twitch just got too much for me let's call it joining yawning yawning on joining I keep saying Joe wrong Joshi yesterday you got 10 notes on twitch yep it's not just the balls are sold right where's the oil spill I'm pretty sure the oil slick was spawning something is this not how it worked maybe not shit maybe we need to make new particles for this we went about well here's the Blargg scared so it goes other one has a spot where is my pops from I'm not that was four times so my managing a soap you skip the face oh I like that this is almost good what is that green yeah that's the wrong color hello rusky man how does that happen that is definitely overflow but I don't see how this can be maybe this after control plus what built Oh strength plus in yes you're not paying attention to my code how dare you yeah so we definitely have to make the soap get used up much quicker than this what am I cooking a new boss fight is what I'm cooking please don't refer to it as cooking you sound like a toddler I'm sorry something's wrong with me I hate this risk Ohio cooking bullshit I just can't stand it I saw a 12-year-old talk like that once and now I just can't stand like it anymore let them cook yeah yeah so far you're fine I'm just going insane I'm a grumpy old man nowadays shit how do I exit this mode I never know in case you are all oh my god Lina you're 17 your opinion doesn't come you're too fast chasing him is janky but if you slow it's too easy so I think you should move slow enough for Mario not to jump around but sometimes go down and elsewhere to chase them oh I like that yes let's add that action states well free go down and reappear elsewhere maybe next week that's and then we have case 6 if you did not make it back to the grills on the soap extra punishment face where some platforms go down and the lark is chasing you cannot deny them what could readability benefit from rewriting it in C++ I get the bronze would not be better possibly I don't know I think readability is like it's not that big a deal especially if like switching programming languages increases your readability I don't know I feel like that's just a skill issue if someone can't read your code is in this case stop no well no what's slightly help like instead of instead of this or well no you wouldn't change that that's so weird with the core OBJ functions that's like completely against C++ then that's cuz it's not really object-oriented programming anymore I don't know I don't think C++ was how well the yeah sure I can do that right perfect by like well yeah the operator overload is pretty cool in C++ okay guess what we haven't done yet actually is these grills here they all need to be objects that can go up and down independently let me let me think what is what is the damage what do we still need to do we need to make it so that he disappears while fleeing and then reappear somewhere else why is my thing so big we need to make it so that if you don't get back on the soap under the grills then you take some damage we need particles we need to make it so that he fall into the oil you take damage and I think that's about it red text is all placement shows you how much to move to text on oh you want to move to text on I would like the text position to stay consistent in every level I don't know why people say C++ is faster and see I think it's definitely slower Oh, so you just would like to slightly move down? I can't move this down that much, yeah? Is there anything else I need to do here? And a slightly reworked model, oh okay. That's a funky way to model it, well, but it works. Oh, can you stress it right back on? Well not really an icon. Your screen rather. Let's see how it looks in game. My 64 code is pretty easy to understand, luckily. What happened? What happened, Biobak? I think you moved the pivot point. C++ can be faster than C, C++ is just way more than that. What can it do faster than C? Like in what way can it ever be faster? The names are kinda terrible, which names? Looks pretty good. I think this is very nice. Did you change the horizontal size? Oh, devs decomp. I thought we were talking about the egg names here. Yeah, I think it's very cute looking. This button brush rule gets so many good makeovers, and it keeps getting better and  It's so fun to move around in too. Like this level is just great. I'm starting to think maybe the sky should be a little bit more blue. It kinda looks like it's overcast out of it, you know what I mean? Well it kinda is overcast with all the clouds. I guess so, but I thought this was supposed to be like a nice sunny town. I guess. Oh, something's weird over there with the sun. Something went wrong on the sun, you see that? What the fuck? Const expression exists in C++, so you can just precompile your values in C++ as well. I haven't seen the whole stream so far, but I like what I see. Good job. Have you considered the block getting bigger again the more you wait since he's moving through the oil? Would be cool. Hmm, that's kinda making the fight more skill-based, and I don't want the gap between like a bad player and a good player to be too big. Replace all the tree cuts with what? A lot more work though. Not really. I can only think of like one or two situations where I had to make it define out of a const expression. The next tree cut texture? Huh? What are you talking about, Nina? There is only one tree cut of texture in that level. Did you not replace the material? Am I missing something? Am I missing something later? What are you talking about? You mean the tree stump texture? You want that to change? But I like having two tree stump textures. That's on purpose. Your texture cannot look bad on the actual stumps on the floor. Wait, why? Because it looked bad. I don't like it. Sorry, descriptive feedback, it just looked terrible on the stump. Like, try it. It doesn't look fitting. I think opacity is still free here. Nope, it's not. Shit. All health? Yeah, all health is free. Why am I not using health? That's funny. I guess I'm not using health anywhere in this game. And just using it is spooky because I don't know what the default value is. It should be zero. For some reason, Mario 64, when you spawn an object, they all spawn with 2048 health. Isn't that messed up? Let me just make sure this is fine. Is it showing? Yeah, I had it like that at first and I reverted it because I just didn't like it. Seems weird. Yeah, I don't know why they do it. Oh, I am using health. Maybe non-loot coins. Let's buy a Mega Man 64X. I saw that it was possible. It's kind of hard to say one algorithm is faster than the other without knowing the test environment. I think we can make the player get three hits before he teleports. Why not just make a new variable in that case? Because that would expand the object struct and we would lose four bytes for every object in the entire world. I'm looking for unused ones that I can just reuse. So I don't need to make new ones. Create a new class. You want every object to have a variable size? You know what that's gonna fuck with? I mean, you can do it, but that makes RAM alignment a lot harder because now we can't statically align object space anymore and we have to have a garbage collector and some sort of cleanup and some memory defragmenting or whatever. You don't think it's easier to just have a static size, no? So you have dynamically sized array. Of course I can make a dynamically sized array, but you run into everything I just mentioned. It's like a skill issue. No, it's a performance issue. I don't want to do those things because that's eating performance. Every object should have a completely unique set of vars. Disagree. I don't think we want to do it. I don't know. I'm a proper heap system. I mean, it makes sense for a hacker because it makes it easier to use for the general use case, but I think it's better for performance, so I don't want to do it. Okay. Okay. Can I literally just do this? Is that all I need? T Lopez made the soundtrack. I heard that name before. Where's my blocky block? This is not how I envisioned this to go. Oh, I know why. Oh, my God, you don't know a thing about the boss fight now. We're just working on the basic skeletons. This is going to be so much harder. You're not just going to have the soap. You're going to be having to dodge shit, and then the platforms will go down and up, and you won't have to dodge shit, and then you get on the soap, and then you attack him, and this is your damaging phase. This is Mario time, you know? You can't just say, oh, Mario time? I don't care. Make it more difficult. Make it impossible to beat. Why are you so presumptuous? Okay, so what's your test case? People talk about, like, oh, my algorithm completes in O from one time or O from N time or O from N log N time, but, like, I don't care, because, like, there's still a scale factor in front of all that, so, like, the scale factor might just be so big that it doesn't matter. Because most normal applications don't run 2 million graph nodes or whatever. You guys want to see my code on how to iterate an array in constant time? You thought it wasn't possible, but I can do it. It's just a very big constant. Haha. Programmers have been tricking us this whole time. He definitely needs to be higher when he does that. Constant equals N factorial? That's not a constant. Yeah. Oh, based on the block size. Yeah, I'm still thinking of that. And we're still going to have to make the block a lot faster and turn a lot faster when you're smaller, right? This is all just, like, the basic. So I'm thinking when he's bigger, he should also turn about twice as fast. I'm also going to make the waves go faster when he's smaller. I'm going to make him zoom around quicker when he's smaller. Oh, this is a float. Whoops. Do you work fast on stream? Like, does it help motivate? That depends on what I'm working on. It makes it easier to stay focused on simple tasks, because I have some stuff to do in the background. But then when I work on actually complex things that I'm having fun with, then I probably work faster off stream. That's why I keep the complicated stuff for, like, off stream. Oh. The custom design is way more radial. Oh, kreisförmig. Hmm. It would be a lot easier to do it like that. But I thought this was kind of cool, though. Why is opacity minus 11? That's an issue. Opacity is not supposed to go below zero. I can swap German letters to some letters, and it looks like an English word for it. Yep. Now try to do that with kreisförmig, but you can't. Hmm. Okay, we have him ducking away and respawning. We still need a way to trigger the self-spawn. This is actually one thing that I've struggled with off stream. I'm not sure how to implement that. Because the idea here... Is that the the strike workers are all in here and they like want to help you so we need to put we need to have a way to like visually put this in here maybe they should be like behind the jail cell here and then throw like soap bars at you from there I have not played Super Mario Quadratics that sounds fun though I do want to play it now is it just like quadratic math formulas like a balcony wall like a jail cell or hanging in cages from the ceiling yeah that works too although if they're hanging in cages from the ceiling and the camera angles like this you're not really gonna see them are you that's one thing I don't like about that but yeah how are you gonna see them they're just gonna be above me and out of the screen he burps out soap bar nah I definitely want the strike workers to shoot them to you they would need to be low enough angle camera angle the camera higher makes the platforming cock and ball torture can you send it to me not a random I want to check it out right now naked Cooper riding on his no there's a janitor Cooper that we have in the main world and he was the only one who was not at the strike so he should just be like the only one who's free and he's just there with his bucket and throw soap at you because he's the only guy that you help in this level the only one you don't fuck with while there are plenty of ones that kind of sound like they would work but don't work me like become the common who will war where they're yeah Mario will definitely get hurt when he touches the floor and just not sure how yet I was actually thinking you should just take damage over time here like he doesn't fade out he just takes damage over time but that kind of doesn't fit with what we had before right if I could just be interrupted by a text was saying soap bar coming up or something I don't like that I don't like the interruption I think it should naturally just okay see I'm thinking because ceiling cages they're not gonna be visible realistically you can't see them I'm thinking we should have like a bunch of jail cells like maybe every second thing here it's just gonna be a jail cell and each one of them is gonna have some people in it and one of the jail cells is just gonna have the Cooper janitor in it and he's like not actually in a jail he's like not the only one not and he has his bucket there and he just throws soap bars at you now we already know how to damage them first we have a soap bar that you write and you just drive into him that like damage to make some smaller how do you communicate to the player that this is the cage to watch out for you don't need to because the soap is sparkling and it's gonna be thrown in right so let's say the cage is here and the soap bar is like thrown and I like bounces here it bounces here and lands here or something you will definitely see it if it bounces like that and we can just make it bounce here here and land here so it is gonna go over the entire field once and then maybe if you really want to you really attend if you can look here and see all the janitors here he's my boy he's my guy he's the one helping me out yes and also sparkles and it makes a sound when it I did not see a link not a random please can you please make it so I make in the game support 60 FPS no that's kind of difficult it's also very specific it's like okay it's can you do a tutorial that does my homework for me see how that's a bit of an issue I am actually planning an other devlog on October 21st all right let's I want to see Super Mario Quadratics is this it how do I play it but we play well that jump fucking suck Mario wait this is a stupid sign that's not even a hey you can't just cheat you can't just cheat in this ah wait this game is too easy dude it doesn't let me edit this what is this okay we're going to the final level they're gonna call me to jump on both his head until you defeated him okay obviously we want minus X squared what's stopping me from just going like minus X minus eight something like this what's stopping from doing that nothing to this game is lame this way too easy I guess it's fun for like sixth graders now that's it that's a really cool idea for like a small child that's like just learning what chronotics this is sick I was expecting something way harder I was expecting to like pull out sign functions and shit yeah so what are we thinking for the cages by Mike you got anything better to offer than the idea I have with the cages being on the sides look I didn't realize it was gonna be an education game for middle schoolers I thought there was gonna be something that challenged me I thought I was gonna have more constrictions here it's cool though I like it a lot it's a very cool idea wait my phone wants something oh yeah we bought a house guys by the way we're moving on 23rd likely yes I will literally work from a dungeon no windows no sunlight I might have to drag him upstairs to get some sun from time to time I think it'd be very much for cinematic and what's like right here Kaiser quadratics let's go that's what I want to play you showed us not making it 60 FPS but spinning the am to make the illusion of 60 FPS oh you want to speed the game up it's a button and runs like 64 it's called f4 you press it it speeds the game up I have to just write my dad real quick I was gonna have a banger song I hope so we actually have one issue if you look at the file size here our ROM is 45.9 megabytes that's like almost three quarters of there to 64 megabytes so we have an issue of just not having any more space for music soon think about it we have 11 courses done so 11 divided by 15 multiplied by 64 megabytes would put us at 46.7 megabytes so we're actually slightly over megabyte budget if you think about it more in the context of like oh mark 64 was already kind of like six megabytes something like that then we just multiply this by 58 and we had six back we still end up at 48 so it's yeah it's not good time to develop your own industry-leading compression algorithm the problem is that most of it is music and we can't really compress that because it has to be streamed directly from ROM duplicate assets okay but duplicate assets don't really help if you look at this let me see where can I see this sound data table here this is 35.6 megabytes of just music two-thirds of the ROM is just music that we cannot compress some of the music we can render the sequence of an extended sound font we can convert music to sequenced music of course but it's gonna sound worse likely there's the issue the problem is also that sequence music is a lot more performance demanding so some levels you know might not want that we cannot use string music for all the big levels right now we probably have to go to course 12 without a street song I think I'm gonna put the janitor here and he's just gonna throw soap us on land actually you should just I think you should target a random one of these platforms yeah if we were to convert one of the songs of the sequence that be of course one song or we could also turn some songs into mono which I don't want to go this over 64 megabytes that's kind of like defeats the purpose hmm the problem with having the soap go into random directions is that it might land into the dirt so we could maybe just like hmm what can we do I think Lester sucks I believe you 100% wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait let me show you something by someone made a diamond on the n64 where is it let me see if I can find it in my safe stuff somewhere no it's not that easy but there's a thing you can do with environment maps where you have the normals not match up at the edges you just have like a little bit of actually not make any sense nevermind can I'm what you're asking makes no sense I have no idea what you want you can't just speed the game up like you can make the emulator run twice as fast but like it's gonna look very bad I think it has to pick out a random grill okay I think before we do the soapbar thing we have to do the grill thing cute at what favorite tank that I made maybe 64 hundred my name is when you did this when okay did just program it like that's my we need to pick lighting conditions for this novel I think the lighting should just come from the top and be generally pretty grim in here any streamed song be ridden shanks for each instrument and be turned into a yes that's actually one idea that the dupe suggested as well like if you have one beat in the background that keeps repeating you could just stream that one separately but if you have an instrument that goes on like the entire time that is obviously still limited no I'm committed to 15 I don't think the 64 megabyte limit is gonna be that big it's annoying but the only The only thing it really means is that we have to cut back on the amount of streamed sequences we use. The only thing it really means is that we have to cut back on the amount of streamed sequences we use. The only thing it really means is that we have to cut back on the amount of streamed sequences we use. Basically I can probably free about 1MB of ROM space right now with no drop-in quality, maybe even 2. Basically I can probably free about 1MB of ROM space right now with no drop-in quality, maybe even 2. The assets are not a big deal, you don't have to worry about the assets. Basically I can free about 1MB of ROM space right now with no drop-in quality, maybe even 2. Basically I can free about 1MB of ROM space right now with no drop-in quality, maybe even 2. Basically I can free about 1MB of ROM space right now with no drop-in quality, maybe even 2. Alright, I think these light conditions are a bit more accurate to how we want them to be. Alright, I think these light conditions are a bit more accurate to how we want them to be. Well, if you look at something like Mario 64, then textures were a much bigger part of the ROM. It's just because we are using streamed music, and music has to be relatively high quality to sound good streamed. Then that is the huge part of the ROM. The music is right now around 70% of the file size. The music is right now around 70% of the file size. I guess it's not unique. 8 direction movement, I did that in one of the Releasio games. It was awful. Okay, 575 drawing radius. Okay, 575 drawing radius. Just adjust the movement. For example, the fact that so many times the game is like Oh, you're playing Mario? Well fuck you, come back as Mario or Luigi or whatever. It's just... why would you do that? I don't know. That's actually also a thing that the Yoshi's Island remake had. Why do they keep adding that shit to the remakes? They're turning video games into chores. Video games are not supposed to be chores! That's my rant for the day. It's not annoying for the same reason. That is false. It's just because they're gating off everything with keys instead of exploring. You lose your freedom. You lose your freedom. My opinion on Super Mario Odyssey? It was kind of fun. If you go for 80%, it's pretty cool. If you go for 100%, it's pretty bad. Depends on what type of player you are. What I mean is what you did is when you did 60fps widescreen a couple years ago. I'm not really forcing you at all. I'm so glad you're not forcing me. This is only the third time you've asked me. I'm so glad I'm not being forced. I think he just wants this game to be 60fps, but I don't know if he understands what that means. It's not forcing you, I am. Oh, shit. Definitely not forcing you, but I'm just saying if you don't do it, there might be consequences. I'm not forcing you, but there will be consequences. Oh, I didn't mean to do this function. Oh, shit. Hey. I think the colors in the background just don't match anything anymore. I think this is kind of an ugly area right now because of the background mostly. Why is the light like this? The light is supposed to be from above. Huh? I had an AK-47 and was killing all the better romhackers. What do you think of this?  No, it never released METARC. I just didn't really work on it anymore. I think he stopped asking you about it too. Yeah. The guy who wanted it. Yeah, but it's all fine. It is what it is. And maybe he'll pop up again. I should just release the radio as an audio. I'll make a note for that. Because the radio in that game was very funny.  Thoughts on Splatoon, especially programming-wise? I have never played Splatoon in my life. I don't understand what's wrong with the light. That is weird. Huh. Huh. Huh. I need to make a rant about W-Linked. LinkList. They fucking suck. I should not build a rant about them. Huh. I'm probably playing Monsters Manor again sometime after the stream. Dude, what is with the light? Why am I not getting this to work? Also, the cages just look awful. This area is just not turning out as I want it to be. Fucked up Yoshi of the week? Oh, let's go. American Christmas. Yay, Yoshi. Topsy-turvy. Thank you, British kid. Precious and priceless. Ah, Yoshi's universal gravitation. Also requested. You have my gratitude, brother. Is that actually what happened? Did they release it under two different names? I wonder what the German name for it is. Huh. I hope I can play more of it later and then I can tell you if it's any good or not for me. I am a hater, though, so just... Oh, I know what I did wrong. Oh my god, I have Unreal Engine problems. Look, I changed to Z-Normal because I thought Z was up, but it's obviously Y. Why did no one tell me? Why did no one tell me that Z is not up in Mario 64? Was no one paying attention to the stream? Unbelievable. There we go. This must be good because Kay's only kinda hates it so far. Yeah, that's a valid way of measuring it. Z-Up is actually better, because of cache coherency. That's a valid way of measuring it. You should have Z-Up in your game. I am willing to die on the cell. I wish Mario 64 was Z-Up. Kay's is extremely picky about games. Although, I feel like... With how long you've made games, with the amount of time you've spent making games, you have very high standards for what a good game should be, in your opinion. Well, I don't really have any, like... There isn't really a requirement I have for something to be considered a good game. It's more so than just it's hard to make a good game, and most people just don't. I mean, we literally stopped playing Bully after we got to the city part of the area. Yeah, Bully is an awful game. That game is the definition of just doing chores. You know what, though? Like, for a Rockstar game, it was kind of fun. At least if it was just kept within the school area. And I guess it's still fun. I guess if the city was a little bit smaller, I don't think it would have been as big of a problem. I think the fun of the Bully game... I don't know if you guys know about it. Basically, the idea is you go to the worst school ever, and everyone there is an asshole, and they all try to bully each other. And the fun of that is all of the character interactions, just how much of an asshole everyone is is fun. But the game is piss easy. And the gameplay is literally just like, hold forward and mash A. But as the game progresses, it goes less from characters interacting to more like, oh, go to this point, go to that point. Punch this guy. And punching a guy is just shaking the Wiimote for five minutes. So it's just like... The game just turned bad. I'm not surprised Unity sucks. I know that would not work for N64. You can do it in software, though. Anything you do that is not software-wise is just like... You're not making an N64 hack anymore. Why should B be up, not Z? I mean, in any real-world coordinate system, I agree, but programming-wise, having Z be up is just more efficient. You know what, Sonic? That's really funny because most of the time in Bully, you bully other bullies. That's it. You're not really a bully to those weaker than you. Except the day when we decided to stop playing. Kaze just decided, you know what? I'm gonna go out with a bang. I'm gonna try and bully everybody. Look, okay, the game lets you beat up anyone you want. I wanted to see if there's any consequences for it. There was not. You just get up again after two minutes. I still don't like the texture here. It just looks like shit. The walls here. One of our neighbor's cats is only meowing again. You can just play as a bully. Honestly, that might actually do kind of well. I wish I could just make games for Easter again like that. The Easter egg hunt game series. We have Thwomp, we have Goomba. I was said outside that I was just a barrier preventing you from going away. You could have guys with proper cages too. There's a problem here. We kind of need the area to be limited. So that it makes sense with the... Actually, we don't know how many rooms I need. I kind of just don't like it. I kind of just don't want that. I want this to be a different scene. Find another texture then? Yeah, but like what do I want? What kind of wall are you looking for specifically? Well, the idea was that this is like an oil barrel, giant oil barrel that he's sitting in. Okay. Maybe giant oil barrel is not the right play at all. Maybe this should just be differently gated off. Instead of Bilzer's tower and he watches you from a throne. It sounds more like it. I was thinking maybe we should, instead of being surrounded by barrel, we should be surrounded by metal buildings and cages. I mean, if you still want to go for the inside look, I found this. You don't know that I discord DMs on screen? No, that makes no sense either. It's not a good texture for this. I mean, it is kind of grungy and dirty. Yeah, but it would repeat way too much. Okay, well inside Bilzer's tower, I kind of like that. I don't know if I want Bilzer to be watching this though. I think that throws up more questions than it answers if we do that. Might have Bowser find out at the end that Mario was the one causing trouble this entire time. I think we just need a different theming for the area somehow. I don't know when it's coming out. I have a full-time job. I can't work on this unlimitedly and there might be any number of things coming in between this and the release date. So, if we have cages and metal buildings, would that look any decent? We'd have to make like a proper skybox and everything too. I don't know. I feel like it's cooler to have a gated-off area. Where would a block drag you once he eats you? Isn't there a secret area in Yoshi's Island somewhere where the block drags you? What were you gonna say? I mean, I like the gated-off area. The barrel kind of works if he's just like surrounded in oil and rubbish. You could have a junkyard or a little lake that's just like a junkyard. Yeah, a junkyard works. I like the junkyard idea. Like you could just have some floating bits of garbage that you can platform on. I do want to keep the grills. Yeah, the grills are fine, but like for the background you could have like floating pieces of junk in the background that are just dirty and dingy and covered in oil. I'm trying to find a floating junkyard. Wait, isn't there an island somewhere in the ocean that's like completely made of junk? Well, we need the junk to be way higher. Yeah. Gouge protectors look like shit. That's the intention. What if we were surrounded by oil tankers? That could work too. It's called Australia. Yeah. Australia is just an island of floating garbage. See you somewhere. I'm not sure about the oil tankers either, because we need the entire area to be gated off so you can't see outside. I wonder if this might be a good example. No, this will look terrible and you still can't see the entire sky. It's the opposite of what I want. See you, sibling. Bye-bye. Is that like a water warehouse? Oh, this could be like a warehouse base. No, no, wait, wait, wait. What am I thinking of? This wasn't Rusty Bucket Bay. Where was the warehouse here? What the fuck is this? What is this fucking thumbnail? That's not what I'm looking for though. Maybe there's a video for it. Let me see if I have the model. I think a warehouse would be perfect here, because you can chain people to a warehouse and it would make sense. So, I'm thinking something like this for him. Why would a warehouse be filled with oil? Because it's an oil warehouse. That's where they keep the oil, at the block. I guess a cave works too. Okay, what if it was a mix of a cave and a warehouse? We'd have like metal at the bottom and then cave at the top. It'd be like a warehouse built into a cave. Okay, I'm not looking for texture. I am looking for basically everything but a texture. He would be done for being chained to a warehouse. So, basically I'm thinking this part here is gonna be metal and then... Well, actually I don't... I want to make sure that Mario can't jump over this. So, let's shift this up 2000 units. Maybe that's too much. Make the square tilted so it looks like it's sinking. Oh, okay, I see what you mean. Yeah, I think a square-shaped one would look better anyway. I was just gonna be lazy and not make it square-shaped because we already have the hexagonal water. So, if you have a square-shaped waterflow, you can have proper hexagonal effects on the edges. Not sure if I 100% understand that idea. Let me check how the size of this is first. The problem is I have to remake this. Okay, well, I guess that's fine. So, the arena is still basically a circle but the visuals is now rectangular or cuboid.  I think we can have this a little bit lower. And yes, there is a concern of Mario going up there, but if we just have the cages be like on the sides here, then that's fine. Because then Mario can't do that. So, this part is gonna be all cavey. It's tilted so it looks like it's sinking. Okay, so you're thinking something like this. All right, that's a very cool idea. I like it. Does it need an entrance? Not really, right? Let me just assume the block dives or something. So, this is gonna be rocky. This is not actually what it's gonna look like. Do not worry, guys. Do not piss your pants. Case, why does this look bad? Case, what are you doing? I am going to pee my pants now. So, dude, it keeps switching to alcohol. Oh my god. So, that's what it's going to be. I'm still gonna do the container theme. It's gonna be a mix of container and cave. It will be half metal, half rock.  yeah, Nintendo was anything but careful with the release. They always fucking suck. So, so, so, so, so,   so, the fact that it keeps switching back to alpha is going to murder me something. Nintendo is selling the same game over and over for 60 dollars. Dude, if I had not moved to Canada while Mario Odysseus was coming out, I would have bought like 30 copies just to sell them again later. I'm so sad I didn't because they're like 200 dollars now. Yeah, but is it new in box? I guess mine would already all be new in box. I wouldn't open a single one of them because I don't give a fuck about the game. I have an emulator. Why would I bought the game? Why would I buy a game that is just free emulated games? Like I can do that for free. Hello, what am I doing? I am making Mario. You think so, Lila? I am going to steal your kneecaps and then I'm going to say, Lila, having no kneecaps kind of looks stupid. Maybe you should fix that. All right, we do need to make new water here. But today is kind of a stack the busy day, so I think I'm gonna say this is it for today. I'm gonna do that off stream. I'm probably gonna finish the whole fight off stream. I have a day off on Monday, so we're gonna get a lot of shit done. I will be seeing you guys in the next stream, which I don't know when that's gonna be. Maybe Monday. Well, until then, bye-bye.
