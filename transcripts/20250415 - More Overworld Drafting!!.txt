Hello, hello this is not a cat, hello xLinx, we are doing more overworld drafting today. The past week I've been super busy fixing up Mario 64's audio engine The more I read it the more I realize this whole thing is fucked And I need to improve it, and I'm working on improving it, and it's slowly getting better Hello Bingus Happy Monday my dude We got any OST wishes today? Yes? No? Feeling or you see very ugly things in the code? Oh no, I see very ugly things in the code. This is not feelings based For example there was a float multiplication with a value close to one on every single node in the entire game every single audio tick which of course is very expensive to compute and Does nothing except actually make it harder to work with the engine There's a lot of stuff like that I Think like almost a 90% code since we're actually not 90% but it's 70% Mario Sunshine OST. Today we're not listening to the Mario Sunshine OST, we're listening to Badoob's overworld songs if you don't know Badoob is the person composing the OST and he has made I think almost 20 songs for the overworld and They're all gonna transition into each other It's called the RTYI overworld pack let's unzip this I Mean so does my name We gotta see if this feels right for the overworld, you know Anyway our mission is to come up with more Well, no swearing hello Zayna You gotta come up with more events and secret stars for the overworld I Think we stopped around course five last time. So, let's see I Need six more At the minimum I'm thinking maybe we just say fuck it and put 40 secret stars in your world You know what? I mean? Like fuck it. Why not? 200 stars in the game We're already at 180 or are we at 185 I actually forgot We see what we were at 180 is the current plan, but 200 is kind of a nice number I will see And next I'm in the mini levels from to we already have most of the mini levels planned into this Shit we completely didn't actually put an entrance for Marty's level anywhere. Oh, well, that's easily fixable still 256 it would be a funny number to put 256, but I can't put 78 more 20 more in the old is reasonable because then you already can just hide shit like it doesn't matter Although 240 also sounds tempting, but I'd have to add so many nonsense Yoshi stars into the game that I don't want to do it Anyway, this one is song to bossa nova Bay Bye Oh, that's so chill All right course six Divine no not the mind. I don't mean Jurassic Jungle. Is there a way this can influence the overworld? Yes, this is the new overworld theme. This is rehappening this year. I have a whole playlist of those fan matrix and showcases That's an early question. Usually these don't come that early, but maybe Permit like tunnels don't know what you're talking about Anyway divine dino domain has to free the shit Yoshi's Unfortunately, I can't go in the level right now because it's current It's bad It's probably in this overworld will have around 50,000 polygons altogether I think He also made a shit ton of sound effects that we can place all around the overworld, which is great Dude the comments under my newest video have been so annoying God I need to strangle someone All right, anyway, and we have to free dipshits we have to Yoshi mama we have to eat prehistoric baby Yoshi We have the Ankylosaurus Koopa We have the T-Rex We have some proterodactyls The yellow tunnels this is the bomb factory You guys might be in luck because there's a chance I will upload again next Sunday because of Squarespace the Squarespace finally opened my link They have fucking finally I Don't weep 64 we get a scene so light and good It's not about the same as a Mars on church. They just have like 25,000 I think Okay, let's move on to the next song tropical sunsets This is for this area here So the music here is just gonna fade into each other when you go to a new area it's gonna be super cool and smooth Yeah, I don't see anyone from Jurassic Jungle who could come out and do something I mean you do have the Yoshi mama, but what the prehistoric Yoshi's in your world really makes sense. I Guess the prehistoric baby Yoshi could come out and be like grown-up or something See we got Koopa carnival, so they won't let you in unless you have enough stars here I resent you think it's gender should I know finished? like Like over 90 I would say Even the mama Yoshi girl. Oh, that's brutal. They come out and they just instantly fucking turn to skeletons I I'm not sure Xena. It's they're still in the level though, right? Do you sequence music or stream music I'm using a mix of both so some of them are streamed and others are Sequenced because stream music sounds better and performs better, but it's so big that we can't have for the entire game and if you look at This we already have 63 songs in the game and 99 songs in the game and likely the final amount of songs in the game is gonna be like 120 or so So that's completely impossible sequence music ever stream music only I Okay, Koopa carnival doesn't really have a story and I don't see a character that could realistically come out of here Bone Factory definitely not Koopa wave Cove. Okay, Koopa wave Cove has the seal here and the Koopa dudes The Koopa dude could definitely do something after the star festival Shy guy with the balloon, but why would he be friendly you would get clubbed by the Yoshi's here Well, I guess this area could be infested with shy guys I think that would actually fit let's let me note that down I Pirate Bay is the next one Why are you yelling but do what happened is he in chat and I didn't see the message They might be toilet dog, I don't actually know He said oh I missed that I didn't get the notification. Well, thank you for this up The grandparents should be seamless like the three. Yeah, they are They will be seamless they're not seamless right now, but don't worry about it I have a plan Hello, but do Dang we're gonna have an entire song just for this area here. I guess that's good though because there is the ghost mission here you do And the tunnel is gonna be really cool if you go through the tunnel and you hear the music faith And You sequence every reason set of MIDI notes, I'm not sure what that means So the shy guy came out of here with a balloon and he was what would he do why would he come out? I don't see it. Well, I guess there is the hide-and-seek mission here you do The team isn't yet true Lightning up to double special effects, maybe we'll see Okay, actually there needs to be something to fit the fork and slowly so I guess there has to be a special effect like that Mm-hmm See what's the next song or world song 6 move for the lava volcano area Yeah, I don't I don't see the vision with the guy though right but cool with Kofus more premise So And I notice something down here Mm-hmm chemical spy. No. Yes Well, there would have a day-night cycle I Think on one end of the night cycle would be really cool on the other It would be really difficult to do it the way where it looks good Because we'd have to dynamically change all the products colors for it realistically look good Yeah, and it doesn't really have a purpose I Hear It was not afternoon starts with someone you get there There's a Koopa dude telling you it's not like the other Koopas that want to run or you just want to chill and go shoot Okay, maybe after the shooting star festival the Koopa should have something else to do CWC Is that Koopa wave cove I Love stompin Puss Right, okay surfer do this here, but you need to seal to get across so He just tells you he just wants to chill and look at the shooting stars once the shooting stars are over He needs to change his text for sure I Guess like a race for you Something like that actually the Koopas in the level already ratio I Think he means we import the level three times and we change the vertex colors and all three and then just linearly interpolate them but that is No When you go through one of these it's gonna load the next area and we're gonna have to change all the colors in the entire model at that time To the correct one, I guess it's technically possible, but like it would cost a lot of cycles But also still it serves no purpose and it's very expensive. I Know it is tempting to look at the game you're making and to be like Let's throw in every cool mechanic that I know of But I don't think that gets you a good game The next old song part No, this is perfect for the case You Now the objective is constant 30 FPS on real and 64 No medicine and a night cycles as you'll see the point of invention games like you need to wait to do certain things I Think it was really really good in my drawers mask and gamers have been chasing the high ever since Hello Belsa Man, this is such a nice break from all the audio code refactoring I've been doing. And actually it's gonna drive me insane. I used to think the audio code in Mario 64 was like the most competent part of the game, but after reading basically all of it, I gotta say, like this is dogshit, it was clearly written by like five different guys that completely forgot what the other three guys were writing, or it was written by one guy who just does not have memory. And like no one bothered to actually read the code and to like remove the redundancies. Every functionality is tripled up on. And then, because they're tripled up, different functionalities are interfering with each other, so there's like three different ways to cap the volume of the background music. And that makes it so that if you want to cap or uncap the background music volume, you have to do so many different things that you really shouldn't be having to do, and that results in bugs all the time. Death Wizard had like a sheet where there's like one bug that's different in JP, US, PAL and Chindu, so they tried four times to get it right and couldn't, because their system is this fucked. Also right now my N64 is running over there, it's gonna be running for six and a half days, because I need footage of a bug that only happens after six and a half days. Make a video. If I make a video called the Mario 64 audio system is fucked, people will fucking kill me. You cannot say anything negative about them, because it was 1996, and if they were doing the same thing in 2024, they would do it so much better than you, because you're stupid and their Nintendo were the greatest of all time. Or cats out, that would be terrible. Anyway, uh, Surfer Boy. Yes, Surfer Boy. How do I unfuck this? I guess like so. Thank you, Rexra. It's crazy how popular that thing is. He also made ambient sounds. Listen to these. We got rain for the overworld. We get seagulls. We can just place seagulls in the world and have them make that sound. We get jungle. We can also fade this in and out and have it be like directional. Creature. Creature 2. Creature 3. Oh, that's a creature. It's a bird. Ocean waves. We can make those directional. I think you could find a thing that happens after a certain amount of hours, days, and then turn it into a livestream. After that, I'm sure it would bring people in. It would. I found a bug that happens after 14 months. I tweeted about it. That would be a banger livestream. Seagulls. Ooh, this is going to be great for the pirate ship. What is the music playing right now? Thundersound.mp3. All right. I'm probably going to listen to the RTYI soundtrack while we're doing this. Right now, we are in... Is this volcano? This is cave. This part. Sigh. In a 14-month livestream, my power is guaranteed to cut out and I would never actually get the bug to happen. Do we have a skybox yet? No. Get back from watching the Goomba video. Okay, before you're truly done watching the Goomba video, you need to tell me that I will get taken down by Nintendo. Otherwise, you haven't had the intended experience. You're supposed to tell me that I will get taken down by Nintendo after watching the  video. I got so many comments about that. And like, it is true that there's a good chance I will be taken down. But you don't know that. Why is everyone saying that it will happen? You don't know that. Why do you think you know more than me? I've been doing this for 12 years. In a Season Assist, what will you do? I will remove Mario from the game. And the Goombas. And the Yoshis. And I will make them my own characters. And then instead of a romhack, I will release a video game. They cannot ban me from making a video game. But can they really take down YouTube videos? Because... Wouldn't that be like silencing critics? Like, you cannot tell me that my videos are not valid criticism of Nintendo. Yeah, I was 64 and they just took down the videos. They can, but they actually can't. Well, it depends on who's the judge. If you go to court, you'd probably win. Maybe. Dude, I could do like the whole Carl Jobs thing. Do a fundraiser. Win the court case. Be a fucking millionaire. Oh my god, that's a strategy. We are coin flipping this. We're gonna get sued. We're gonna start a fundraiser for legal fees. We're gonna coin flip winning the actual court battle. And then if we do win, we get lawyer fees paid for. And we don't have to pay anyone back. Instant millionaire. Bloodpunk and Catechonomist are selling the games. Yeah, that's fair enough. Release it as a game as a hyper nice auto extract as a repack rom compiling super terrible software to distribute. Well, that's kind of what a patch is. Epic Games did this, really? That's how they got rich? I think so, too. Oh, there's a good chance. But I mean, even then, out of like a hundred, over a hundred projects I've made, I had one project taken down and like 70 videos taken down. And every video that I tried to get back up went back online. So they've only really taken down one single game. And that was The Missing Link. It wasn't even a Mario hack. Okay, back on track. Koopa with Koffdude. We need to think about him. He's gonna do something after you are done with the Star Festival. I can't just awkwardly be standing here still waiting for the festival after it's over. He could just say, Oh dang, I was chilling so much I missed it. I think that would be cool. Oh dang, I chilled so hard. I missed the Star Festival. Maybe that's all we need. Oh yeah, he did really fuck that up. He kind of scammed his viewers. Epic Games Wallet nearly broke the rules of both mobile stores, so they would be taken down and they sued Apple and Google for it. They lost some and won some. Dude, they fucking baited them. That's crazy. And they probably got insane PR for it too, because everyone hates those mobile game stores. How have you not heard about this? How would I have heard about this? I don't play Fortnite. Well, okay, the way he fucked up, I actually saw the code running live. So what he did is, basically in his video he said, Oh, this guy, he is responsible for this person's suicide. Which, I mean, obviously he wasn't. He got sued for that. But then towards the public he said, Yeah, I got sued for calling him a cheater. So obviously the public is like, Well, okay, this is bullshit. This is injustice. We will stand up for this. We will donate money to this guy. And then like afterwards, the public found out, Wait, that's not actually what he got sued for. We kind of got scammed here. So, yeah, if you just lie to your viewers, it is quite likely that the viewers will be mad at you. They made a 1984 style ad against Apple for taking down Fortnite. Oh my god, dude. Maybe. Maybe my future is not in game development. Maybe my future is in like anti-Nintendo grifting. I will purposely bait them into taking me down and make it a whole political thing. Let's see this. Unification directives. For years they have given us their songs, their labor, their dreams. In exchange, we have taken our tribute, our profits, our control. This power is ours and ours alone. We shall prevail. That is crazy.  It's a cringe. Referencing 1984 is always a sure way to win any argument. I think that's a based arguing tactic. Yep, that's exactly what happened, Sonic. New Fortnite player is shit ton of free cosmetics. That's why I support Fortnite in their fight against Apple. Oh my god. Oh my god. We gotta learn from Fortnite, dude. Okay, so I think the surfer dude is a no for any star missions. What about the dojo? There should be something in a dojo. Dude, there's two ways to win any argument. The first is you saying that your other person is saying something Hitler said and the second is you're saying the other person is like 1984. Yeah. That is true, dude. And they are also pioneering child labor with their Fortnite island creator codes. Oh my god. I think there should be something inside the dojo you can do. That's true, actually. Minecraft pioneered child labor and they didn't even do it on purpose. Minecraft walked so Roblox could run. What if there was just a room with a little fight in there? I think we're just shitposting, Sonic. You don't have to worry about it. Just shoot in the shit. Should probably have a room with a fighting place. How's that different from what I said? Oh, is there like a Tumblr creepypasta reading lady? On the right side, versus elder voice Yoshi. How would the fight go? I don't want to make way too much here. Sorry, I gotta check for these things. What's inside the building? Like, does it have any secrets or something? Well, that's what we're thinking about right now. I just put the building here because it looked cool and I had the building. I think there should be something inside. What? We're slow and it's not even a real fight. All you have to do is punch him once and his dentures fall out. That would be hilarious. We're not making chicken, Jockey. All right, I want to listen to a new OST. Any wishes? New Super Mario Bros 2, let's do it. New Super Mario Bros 2! God, did I find the right video? Is this the New Super Mario Bros 2 OST? It is? Thank you, I wasn't sure. New Super Mario Bros 2!  Yeah, I was too focused on whether this is Mario Bros 2. I couldn't even enjoy it. Let's restart. New Super Mario Bros 2! Are you really sure it's the New Super Mario Bros 2 OST? New Super Mario Bros 2! Just use me as a trainee and just beat Batmaster in the next 10 minutes. You know, I'm not making an evil Yoshi, Master. If anything, we can make him stupid. This looks great. This is supposed to look like dog shit. This is the first draft. Why do so many people say this overall looks great? There is something... There has to be some mental effect going on here where you see all cases making this. It has to be good. This is garbage. Sumo Yoshi? Have I googled Sumo Yoshi? It's very questionable. Okay, yeah, Fur Affinity. Fur Affinities is porn. I wasn't sure.  I can Mirabilis. What's it with, like, Nintendo fans and inflation fetish? This has to be, like, the Nintendo analog of, like, whatever the fuck Sonic guys are doing. Okay, let's say it is an old, wise Yoshi master. How would the fight go? He could have his cane. He could do something with his cane. Maybe he slowly walks up to you with his cane and, like, hits you like this. And you just kinda take knockback. And then you punch him once, and he just instantly loses. So this isn't a tutorial area anymore? Yeah, and it's way too late in the game to do a tutorial area. Course 1 has been made the tutorial area. I'm very funny as a joke, but I need something else afterwards. You're not invisible, Mimira Ballas. I see you just fine. Please don't crash, OBS. Thank you. Can we just jump on his back and call that the thing? No. Okay. He could be a preparation for the final boss fight. You know how the final boss fight turns into Yoshi Bowser? Hmm. How do you hit him? Wait, I didn't write down how you hit him. Ah, temporary repression. Okay, I see. Okay, that doesn't work. I know what the bubbling Yoshi is, Moldy in the Water. Old Yoshi. Elder Yoshi. Yoshi. We have a Yoshi Elder kind of like this. When you say Yoshi, you need the character name. I just say Yowza. It's too good. Oh, I see what you mean. My boy. Hmm. Yeah, I don't really see it. Maybe there's something useful he can teach you instead. Yowza or Boushi? I'm not sure. I don't know. Hmm. Seems like my setting goes into serious mode. That would be funny if he had a fake center beard with a band around his face. Let me think about it. How would that go? So, first he just is an old man that walks up to you slowly with a stick and then hits you once on the head to bonk you. Maybe you punch him once, he goes, he rips off his fake mustache and says, all right, time to get serious. And then what does he do? Maybe it's like an actual, just like a straight up character versus character fight. Can it work like a hints room? Maybe if someone is stuck on a secret star spectrum, he can teach you. Hmm. He gives you hints about stuff. He's like, I'm the wise old Yoshi. I can help you out. But I will only help out this guild. If you want to know how to make progress, you have to beat me. And then you fight him and you just kick him once. And then he tells you how to make progress in the overworld, maybe. Or he tells you stuff you're missing, yes. So, hmm. Would he tell you about secret stars in the overworld? Or would he tell you about how to make progress? I guess how to make progress is pretty obvious. So, okay, fine. He'll tell you about secret stars. You know what? I like that. That's funny. Yoshi Dojo has an old man in there. He tells you secret stars or hidden levels in the overworld you've missed. He will only share his knowledge with this guild. So you have to beat him up first. Fight is just tight. It's just him slowly walking at you with his cane. Then hitting you with the cane. There's no damage, just knock back. Kick him once to instantly win. The hints are in a specific order. And you have to finish the previous hint first before moving on to the next. He only can give you hints for overworlds you've entered before. Pathetic Wiggly Egg. You know, that's funny, but that's more work than I'm willing to put into this gag fight. That's a great way to fill the overworld. Unfortunately, we still need 6 secret stars. Or 26 if you want to go with 200 stars. I'm fine with either one. We are only like halfway through the overworld now. So 26 still seems reasonable to me.  This one has the melon patch. And it has the ship. We have 180 stars so far, Sonic. Well, 180 are planned. In-game is like... I think we have like 120 stars in-game. I didn't actually count. True. The very first hint he should give you is a secret star in the dojo. Let's do that. The very first hint he gives you is a secret star in the dojo. But he also tells you to come back if you are stuck again. Which game is this? We are making this game. Let's return to Yoshi's Island. So... Maybe like a fake door in the dojo. Like a door where if you punch it, it rotates and goes behind. Secret star is a fake door that if you punch it, it spins and lets you through to the other side. And I see a star. Alright. That's another secret star to our list. Make that 16. Star in the dojo. For your first hint, fight to the death. You go to the middle and you get the secret star. Then the hint's mechanic is explained. Now... The hint's mechanic is self-explanatory. When he says, I'll help you out if you're stuck. And come back again if you're stuck again, I think. We can assume the player has at least half a brain, I think. I think that's fine. Hello, Selvala. Oops. I have a lot more videos I could upload about lower polygon counts like that. And if people like it, I could make it a whole series. That's the easiest content to make for me. Although I feel like it would get very repetitive very quick. I'm pressing F like it's Unreal Engine, but it's not. Why is it 0x39? It really shouldn't be. Actually, it's a checkpoint. I exported the wrong level. Goddammit. Modest content life. You seem crazier than a new Donkey Kong. The grass is bananas. That's cool. Add a preformance count at the bottom and do %speedup or something. Wait, what? Please explain what the content life is. Can you listen to the Nova Ross 2 music? Are we not listening to New Super Mario Bros. 2 music? Should we check again? One second, let's make sure. Yeah, I think we have the right OST. How will the out-of-play areas behind the training walls be filled in? Some of them is with forest. That's what is marked with the forest area here. And some of it is with mountain. SpringPresent makes videos about your work. It's a necessary evil. Personally, I don't like having to make videos. But it is the only way I can make any profit out of this. And pay the people that help me. And now that I have an editor and sponsors, it's a lot easier. So, we'll probably fill this in. Oh, we can fill this in with water. We can make this water at first and then have it become lava. You should let Okayo know. He's on Twitter. Tell him how much you like the videos. Cobblestone generator. Am I being pop-cultural reference tested today? Is that why I'm getting so many of those? I know what a cobblestone generator for Minecraft is. I'm part of the in-group. I'm a cool kid, I promise. What's the name again? Okayo. Oh, what the fuck? You play Vintage Story instead. It's only the best sounding game in the world. Oh my god, dude. Was there a right answer to this? Was I supposed to say I have no idea what that is? Was I supposed to ignore you? How do I win in this scenario? Was this a setup? A trap? A lose-lose? I'm just gonna accept it again. So I was outplayed the second I engaged with it. Meow, meow, meow. Oh, now I should model all the individual trees instead of using tree walls. That would probably send the framerate to hell, though. We're not using tree walls in the end. We're doing something better than this. It's probably going to be like three or four tree walls behind each other. Like we do it in Curse 1 or something. I'd love to experiment with it, but it definitely will not be easy. This instrument is kind of awful. So, what else is left for the game before it releases? Just the overworld? The overworld is one part. I do want to refactor the sound engine entirely. I've been working on that pretty hard the last week. I want to refactor the operating system. I do not like Nintendo's operating system. I want to get beta tests of every level in the game. So that we know the exact gameplay issues. Then I want to apply the beta testing feedback and improve all those levels. That usually doesn't take long. It's like a two or three day process per level. Then we still have to wait for Biobank to finish a lot of the level reworks. And we need to do the side levels. And I need to do a big round of bug fixes. Oh, that's kind of nice that you can walk in here. You have a squid game. What is a squid game commission? Someone's asking you to make a squid game character or something? Or is this part of the guide that I've sent to you? Who wanted it for his game? Are you going to make squid game maps? Wait, how? Where did they find you? What is a squid game map? Mario cannot swim in lava now. So here I have Plowtzen's, I don't know, he just makes good music. So this is gonna be a field full of melons with some melon farmer Yoshi. And I'm thinking this would be ripe for a mini-game. Oh, so you're making the actual maps that the squid games were taking place on in the TV show. Dino Dino Land? That's not a stage. You might be thinking of Jurassic Jungle, which is a prehistoric level where you meet prehistoric Yoshis. The level has a story about the Yoshi Mama and the Yoshi Baby, and the three dipshits who are like funky looking Yoshis that want to steal her egg. So let's say we put the shit out of melons there and you can farm them by ground pounding them. Maybe not. Maybe you help him protect this melon somehow. Maybe like Shy Guys come by and... Oh, that would be a crazy overworld event. Imagine if there was an overworld event where Shy Guys came by and tried to steal those melons. Well, the prehistoric Yoshis are a lot bigger and more brutal looking, so kinda. I think I have already noted you down somewhere in the credits anyway. But I can double check. Let's see, I don't want to show this on stream. I might have you under a different name. Either way, I will make sure to write it down. I have a big special thanks section and a big beta tester section in the end. Yeah, okay, so let's make this melon farm here and then Shy Guys with Spears come by and they want to steal his melons at some point. Maybe the Shy Guys bring something where they put the melons on. We want this to have a permanent effect on the overworld, so remember that the event happened. So we need there to be a permanent change after that event happened. Shy Guys come on Storks and try to steal melons. What did you miss? We planned the Eldar Yoshi fight and now we're planning the melon mission. The idea is that there would be a ton of melons here. This, by the way, in the end will become the boss fight area. But for now we will just put a ton of melons here and then Shy Guys come by and try to steal them. So we bounce on melons and turn them into melon monsters. Creative idea, but I don't want to go that far. Melons are friends. Yes, the old Yoshi-sensei is back. He has a boss fight. The boss fight is just him slowly walking at you with his cane and then he tries to bonk you with it. And he's really slow and he's kind of a joke fight. Yes, the beta testing will happen in parallel with all the reworks and the sound engine stuff. We have course 3 and course 11 tested and I think they're both good to go now. Course 3 for sure. Course 11 maybe not. Anyway, the fight. Shy Guys with spears. Maybe they have him in a corner. Maybe the event is like they have him in a corner here all with his spears. And they spike him and he goes... And then when you come by he turns to Mario. Mario, help me. These guys want to steal my melons. I don't want to reference pop culture from 2002 though. Or 2001. Dude, wait. If the idea is that this was released in 2000 and we wanted it to be an outdated reference... We should have one Yoshi talk about wanting to visit New York to take breakfast on the Twin Towers. But yeah, I think the right setup for this is that the Yoshi would be here and they try to pike him with the spears. And that's how the fight starts. I just need to think about a permanent change that this actually makes to the overworld. Super Mario 64 used level of detail? It does. On the Mario model and on doors. And I don't remember any other instances of it. Yeah, what permanent change does this make? Do they maybe come in a wagon or something? Do their bloodied dead bodies just lie around here after you beat them? I don't think so. And that explains why the game never got released. True. The Twin Towers? Exactly, exactly. And a little cube next. Okay, but for real, big buildings in the background, like around this area here, would look super cool. I want there to be a big brick building now. I'm gonna do that. Maybe it's gonna do something in the end, I don't know. I'm gonna make a brick building. This is a plan from being hijacked by Bowser's minion in the postgame. Or maybe Yoshi tells a joke and another one says he's trying to be the next Bill Cosby. That would age very poorly. This means that maybe Mario can use the lava to set a new spirit fire? The lava is only there during the boss fight and then it disappears. So that wouldn't be a thing that's possible. It's also awkward to be carrying around items like that. That's something I'd rather avoid usually. You know, it's always tempting to make Mario carry an item around to make a mission work, because it's so easy to make missions work with that. But the truth is that carrying items just isn't fun. I use PJ-64, yeah. This thing in Souls game is actually going to look like an Arc Tree in Dark Souls. Let's see that. That does look pretty cool. Very ominous. You know what this reminds me of?  Black Towers? Is this how it goes? In the anime. Yeah, these. The control spires. The evil wiki. Do you think they might just throw them towards a cart or a box or something? The spears? Okay. It reminds me of Berserk. I don't remember something like that existing in Berserk.  Oh, to save the melons. The melons are going to be giant. I wasn't thinking of them being pick-up-able. We're thinking about a permanent effect from the shy guy trying to steal the melon's mission. That keeps the overworld forever visible. Or that keeps a reminder of what happened in the overworld. Maybe he learns a lesson and builds a fence around this. It's like this will keep the shy guys out. But I don't like that, actually. Maybe he plants a piranha plant that will eat shy guys. Sunshine melon rolling time? No! What if he did plant a piranha plant that eats shy guys? I think that'd be cool. Just a single plant here. This is my new buddy. He's going to help me. He will eat the shy guys. I don't know what else the plant would do. Or how else he would do it. But I feel like that adds a lot of character. I will write that down. Could be a two-phase event. First you're trying to prevent goonies from eating the seeds. And then the shy guys from eating the melons. That's true. But I kind of want the melons to already be here when you get here. Otherwise this would look very barren. I don't know. In the melon garden. In the garden of Yoshi. At some star count, a bunch of shy guys attack. And you'll have to save him from getting spiked by them. After you save him and some in-time has passed. He's planting a piranha plant. And proudly proclaims that this plant has been trained to eat shy guys. I think that's a good start. And that adds to the events. So this is perfect. Makes the overworld feel very alive. One, two, three, four. Let's see if the shy guy in the melon garden event happens. Piranha plants from radio world. So he can take the plant wherever he wants. Yeah, it should be a potted one. It's a potted piranha plant. Proudly proclaims that this plant has been trained to eat shy guys. There we go. Should we make it so that you're able to pick it up? And that does something maybe. That could be a good secondary start. That could be a second part of the mission. I don't know what it would do though. Maybe it shouldn't be pickable. It would also be awkward when you can just walk through everything with the plant. Maybe they need someone to play the part of the egg thief. With some shy guys acting and the alchemist playing the part of McGuffin at the festival. I don't like to think of the shy guys as like an organized group like that. They're just like individual tribes that do stupid stuff. You need someone to... Oh, okay. I already read that. Is the mother Yoshi and the egg-napping important to lore like the legend of Romulus and Remus? Perhaps an upcoming festival is already in the hatching. Planted the happy, happy tree. Oh, it's supposed to be like millions of years in the past. I wasn't thinking that this would actually be lore for the islands. But it would be kind of cool if it was. Maybe that is a great idea and we should implement this somehow. What if there were like cave drawings about it? Somewhere. It could be in the volcano area. So like a cave drawing of the dipshits and how Mario beat them. It's the same sound as the dipshits. No, it's supposed to be like cave drawings. I would like to put cave drawing easter eggs. Where? Here? I wasn't thinking of it much as an easter egg though. Oh, I see. Yes, yes, of course. We could have a couple cave drawings. I will make a note for now. There's an area there but not enough cave drawings yet. I know what you mean. But I think this is important enough lore that it should just be here. We can definitely put more cave drawings there. Just random stuff. Could be more related to the Piranha Plant or something. Man, Quest 3 has so much hidden lore to it. It's like by far the most. Is this the entire world of Yoshi's Island? It's supposed to be the entire world of Return to Yoshi's Island, yes. It's gigantic. It is pretty big. What's the Divine Dino remake? I don't know actually. Only Biopark knows. This is also all going to be one open world with no loading zones. Well, there are going to be loading zones but no visible loading zones. I think it's going to be extremely cool. And it is supposed to be in the shape of a Yoshi. And there's going to be a map you can open in the pause menu. But it's not really the shape of a Yoshi just yet. All levels done now? The first draft of all levels is done, yes. Well, there is one area in Course 13 missing because Zeyna wanted to work on it. And she has been putting a lot of detail on there. But I finished course 14 and 15 in the meantime. I can see Naoyoshi a little bit, that is good. So how many do we have now? 16. Why do I have 17 left, I've listed them. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, what? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, that's 8. I should make a separate list. This sound is going to drive me insane. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 events. In stages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 18, okay. We're only missing 3 more stars in the OLL to get to 180. Do you have a hard dot line so that you don't just keep adding things? No. But I'm not just going to keep adding things. I have a very clearly defined scope of what I want to do. Which is 15 levels and an overworld. So now we're just making the best overworld we can. It was always going to be 15 levels, it's never changed from that. I've never had the issue of just keeping adding things. This is part 11. Mushroom plains. Lofty lumber leaves, right. Is there anything we can do with that? What is planned after the overworld? Some side levels? Yep, definitely side levels. And lots of bug fixes and beta testing and stuff. Can you use autoport from a tunneling software such as PlayGG? I don't know. What? Okay, so there's just going to be a gondola that carries you to the big tree here. What characters are there? There is... Is there a fucking squirrel in this level? Okay. There is a fucking squirrel in this level. I forgot about that. Something's wrong here for sure. This was the star. The acorn picture. That's funny. Yeah, the squirrel is... It's a little weird that it exists. I'll be honest. That was a weird choice to make the squirrel exist. It's not even like Mario Fight or anything. It's literally just a squirrel. But this level is very pretty. Like damn. I like it a lot. I'm not sure. I guess there's no squirrel in Mario. Okay. So there's these guys. There's the trash pandas too. The raccoons. Not the trash pandas. Can you do particles like those leaves? I have not... There are no words that can describe how to do it. It's just code. They're all just programmed. They're not actually models. Yeah, but they're too new. And there's also the whole raccoon family. They're also just animals. Nothing's wrong with the music. There.  Oh, this broke. How sad. So, if we had a character from here visit the overworld... I guess it would have to be the squirrel or the raccoons. The world looks like Alpha.  Wow, the music looks weird. Yeah. Yeah, I don't see any of these guys visiting the overworld. Doesn't make any sense to me. So let's think about the next level. Okay. We got the back entrance to course 1. That could be doing something. A wounded bird who wants to fly back up to... L.L.L. Huh. Huh. I could see that working. You know what, I'm gonna beta test course 4 soon. I'm just... Nah, he's a lazy couch dad. He doesn't want to go anywhere. So this leads into the windmill of course 1. Maybe you can do something there. Like... Hit the switch or whatever. What if there was a switch to permanently stop the windmill from rotating there? That would make players think that that's important. And that that does something and they get something new. But they don't. That would be misleading and I don't want that. Discard that idea. Instead... Maybe that shouldn't do anything. Okay. Let's see, Bowser's oil rig. There's the oil block. Once you beat the oil block, the water stops being oily and you can swim over here to... Bowser's oil tanker? Is that the idea? Bowser's yacht? After beating step 3 of Olly Olly Bay and step 3 of Koopa Wave Cove, a manta ray appears in your world and lets you go to Bowser's yacht. Yeah, okay. I also have a note for a pot with two wallkicks. Then you wallkick between using the ice cap? That would be a very simple secret star to add. Just like, use the ice cap, fuck it, here's your star. I should maybe have more of that. Oh, but I'm afraid of adding... Oh no, nevermind, it's already too late for that. Or would he be going to Bowser's yacht? Because it's... Bowser, okay. Bowser's a capitalist in this game. He has a theme park and he has an oil rig. Alright, Bowser has a yacht. And if we don't show the player, they're gonna be mad. He's not just a capitalist, he won capitalism. He needs a yacht. He needs a golf course too. I'm thinking maybe the golf Mario level should be Bowser themed as well. Bowser themed. Bowser's golf course. Bowser is rich. Oh no, that would be an additional mission afterwards. That's like a bonus level biobank. Like, there's a manta ray here, but he can't swim this way because there's an oil spill. And to clean up the oil spill, you need to beat the boss in Oily Boily Bay. But then once it's all cleared up, you can jump on the manta ray. And go there. Bowser doesn't pay taxes. That's the whole reason he's trying to overthrow the monarchy. Because he doesn't want to pay taxes. Because he's already wanted for tax fraud and he's not paying. Daisy Cruise kind of level? Yeah, that's what I was thinking for the yacht. It would definitely be a big ship. But more linear in that you go around the outside and climb to the top. Definitely kind of looks like Daisy Cruise. Not gonna lie, I respect Bowser. I mean, it's true. If someone's a billionaire, they surely have some kind of quality. That makes them be able to get a billion dollars. This is not Epstein Island. This is Yoshi's Island. It has nothing to do with Epstein. There are no little children on this island, I can promise you. The yacht level could also be a sneak level. You can sneak around the screen near the yacht. We already have a sneak mission and I don't think sneak missions are that fun beyond the fantasy of it. So having two of them is a little questionable. I don't want two stealth levels. So yeah, this mission already does something. Then here, course 13. Not 13. Part 13. We have the craft level. Okay, the craft level. There isn't really anything we can do with the craft level. No one can escape from the craft level. It wouldn't make any sense. Yeah, there's a star in the zoo with the sneak mission. Epstein Island. And course 12 already has the blacksmith come out of the level. Man, the overworld fills a lot as you play. That's really cool actually. It does have amusement park vibes to it. I guess it's bound to look like that. If a Mario level looks like a playground, then a huge Mario level has to look like an amusement park, right? You know what? This should have the freefall tower in here. I'm gonna note that down. Make the freefall tower from the carnival level visible here. That would look so cool if you were here and you saw a freefall tower from there. And you were like, what the hell is that? And you go here and they're like, nope, we're not letting you in. You're not getting on the freefall. Could have a secret level be marked with an X on it. That's true. But then we would need to make a whole new secret level. And I think we have enough. Also, we're now done with all the levels and we only have 18 overworld stars out of 21. So I think 180 stars is gonna be the final count and not 120. It is kinda in the game with the ice cap. Not quite. They give you like a secret formula to the secret level. You can easily add more secret levels. That's true. How many stars are planned? Right now 177 stars are planned. But we want 180 stars in the game. And there is a chance we will just up it to 200 stars for the nice round number. And because it's really easy to add a bunch of secret stars to the overworld if you really, really want to drop the quality of them. Yeah, 180 doesn't look too bad. The yoshi stars there's 44 yoshi stars so without the yoshi stars we're at 136 which is still 16 more than normal mark 64  yeah there is these tone stars that are basically joke stars in the original game and there is stuff like the slide where you just do the same thing twice so it's like and then there's also stars like wing mario over the rainbow where it's just 15 clouds we place down hello skyloft yeah mips also appears twice oh the odyssey movie got stars everywhere yeah i think having 41 stars takes back the importance of the actual courses maybe let's just relate to both the yoshis and this game's story well the yoshis have been kidnapped and you need to collect the stars so you get power to beat bowser it makes sense as you go across the game there's always a barrier that's like oh you need this many stars to power this thing to do this thing so there's a gap you gotta get more stars  i think 180 is a fine final number all right but three more honestly we do not need to plan those three more stars i think they will naturally come up as we go along and in fact probably more than three stars will come up as we go along i wouldn't be surprised if we ended up with 190 stars after all or 185 or something coins are important in this game perhaps the secret coin level coins are not really that important yet are we gonna drop a 9-11 hint somehow are we gonna tell people that 9-11 is gonna happen it would be mean not to minuses can be like lesser smaller stars that add to the concept the same but a symbolic less hey that feels nasty i'm not saying it was bowser but it is kind of sus that never mind never mind never mind i'm not i'm not even finishing the joke can we have an world event when the what no i'm not adding 9-11 to this game this is supposed to be like a castle in the end by the way so let me just do mark up like that so these are gonna be castles from mario world 2 that yoshi destroys as you get along the game so but they're gonna be maybe they're gonna be like crooks like yoshi has already kicked them over i think that would look cool so hello sequel  okay um i think i'm happy with the overworld plan the penicills they kind of have to be on the island i i somewhat agree here so i think our next step would be actually like finishing the mountains kind of so that there are full mountains in the world view so that we can actually have like a better overview of what's what i don't think we need to finish the forests so that looks fine to me yeah and after that we're gonna try to make this look passable how possible is it to use some of the level specific mechanics like the baby yoshi head the baby yoshi had this made to be reusable and i actually have a note somewhere in my level idea list that says to reuse it so where did i write them down i have a bunch of ideas that i wrote down for like stuff i want characters should reappear make the penguins appear in later levels again if you have freedom for easter eggs or stars okay penalties on different levels of the main story talking and makes them appear in new levels okay definitely not yoshi mama bar is already planned in oh i see boshi reappearing in the overworld would be fun um let me add to the booners um when it comes to buy one time level mechanics like being able to buy the ability to go into an epic rolling mode or something no i don't like that that would break levels too much okay are you thinking of using those level mechanics for like side courses biobank i think that actually has a lot of potential we could make like super small side courses like mario sunshine has them with just one mechanic some extra conventional extras you can plan i told you about in dms did i forget about this i might have forgotten about this so i don't think the penguins reappearing makes sense here we can move this to part five actually i want to run to super happy tree so and boshi after the duel i think we can do that because he said he's done playing cowboy after you beat him so he has to disappear from the level so this is genuinely very important to me so he has to be in the overworld after he's done let's see just go back to the village and this kind of an asshole to everyone but the game have a button for running what do you think there is no bar but there absolutely should be one somewhere okay we'll make part eight have a bar not sure what it's gonna be but it's just gonna be fruit juice fruit juice bar i just think it would look cool um maybe this is where boshi would hang out and he's depressed i don't want him being depressed so maybe he should have a personal evolution while the game keeps going like after that he's like leave me alone he's an edgy angsty teenager and then later when you are like 150 160 stars he's more like maybe i should be part of yoshi society again there are no puzzle levels hmm yeah i don't really see a place for yoshi to just chill he's laying next to a target on a wall and there's a you know what i have a banger idea i have a banger idea so he should be in some remote part where no one else would usually be hanging out because he doesn't want to be with anyone he's like done with people he's just a little angsty and edgy um so i think a good place for him to hang out would be maybe here yeah he's gonna get like his own ledge so we are going to give boshi character growth and the character arc um boshi is alone on the far away ledge not talking to anyone doing shooting practice there is a target on the wall with nil hits on it and a bunch of bullet holes around it he is telling you to leave him alone he needs to practice or um well if you have below 160 or so stars after 160 stars he drops his edgy demeanor and asks you for tips answer like four or five questions answer questions he hits your targets and gives you a star he becomes your friend him and yoshi find each other and become friends is he the one on your head i completely forgot about the conspiracy yoshi we still need to add him  where would the conspiracy theory yoshi be he would probably hide somewhere in here do we still do that did you ever make the level for him biobank yeah i get the joke i like it i'm not buying a switch to at all so i made the first one i love you don't have it i can't send it over gotcha yeah then that's good i think that's good enough we can just throw the rest in just thinking about the correct place to put an entrance probably this part here that already has that yeah i think the mushrooms is the best conspiracy yoshi house level just find the secret entrance already puts it at 20 so we had 179 stars he is in a blue mountain that's that's easy to make work then because there's mountains here we can just make this blue there's lots of mountainous area here yeah we can easily find a way to get there howdy manadono show the shit post what shit post anyway um i think this is good for today next time possibly tomorrow we are going to start finishing the mountainous area so that it actually looks like mountains from above and then we can uh start also making a little bit of visuals on a dvz shit post this is just me i'm re-watching dragon ball z right now with the german dub and i'm gonna make a list of all power levels and they're gonna be completely wrong because i hate how the fandom talks about that there's no multipliers on dragon balls it's bullshit that's not how any of it works if you actually watch the show and i'm gonna make everyone angry it's gonna be my biggest rage yet and it's gonna be genuine genuine rage made i'm good at that anyway i will see you guys next stream bye bye
