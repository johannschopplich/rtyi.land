Hello? Hello?  Hello? Hello? Hello?  Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?  Hello? Hello? Hello?  Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Try both vertical and diagonal that's not gonna look like anything diagonal lines are gonna just reflect over the whole strip here I'm just not convinced on this technique More details, right, but no detail is gonna make platforming impossible because like how are you gonna judge the angle of slopes and stuff? I Used stars at first It was the star skies texture This one here this one does look a lot better, but it's still really bad I Think it's just a terrible idea. I Need to see what Dario did here again Dario made such a nice version of this. That's like way better Let me find it Oh Great discord is fucking broken again. I love this part. I guess I can't find the video then This is the video How do I There we go This is what they did and it looks so good, why can't I do that? This is even work What this look good with like much bigger faces What if I made the texture smaller like Like So, yeah like so maybe To control are in the skirt might fix it. Maybe hello easy easier I'm currently looking at this because Dario told me that maybe this would look good on my wall here But it just doesn't What if We do this And The texture has a bit of brightness everywhere and then we add random depth details to it Against the black texture, this is true. I Don't think that what changed much There is a week Maybe but I mentioned they don't want to come on stream and teach me how to make the graphics good I Try something here It's too bright Please please consider banana cats. You want me to look at your banana cats on stream right now? Is I made this it's awesome We're making a very stupid hack for the next time hoops competition in this I am not actually a romega I am the voice actor. I don't actually program anything for it. I'm literally just The stand-in celebrity It will be funny Holy fucking shit, you should try reducing the opacity. I increase the opacity or what do you mean? I Don't make story it's so much better Bananacat LSI Does this fix anything I Don't think it does what if I gave this a little bit of detail? Hello normal You're right with the Jetsons, but I look like extremely ugly so I don't want to do that I Change with the space level since a week ago. Oh a lot. I realized that's ugly and I changed the whole graphics again Do you think a 480i mode would work on? Okay, so my engine is designed around taking advantage or my game is designed around taking advantage of the engine So obviously that would like because my game takes full advantage of the optimizations But if you were to apply my optimizations to what LR 64 obviously you would be able to run it at 480i modes without too much trouble I Don't know if that's the answer you were looking for I Need one big break Hello Crayon Braille This one maybe What Makes reflections look good Tough question This any better doesn't really feel any different to me Maybe if I make this bigger Now you can see some texture behind that so that might mean not so bad Should I be finding break texture? No, no. No, this is this is not something that I think can be solved with a single texture I think the whole concept is shit that I have right now And there was optimized that when I play the real hardware increase the FPS and settings in every other N64 game I put in great Should do a glowing sign instead of just reflection might work better. I'm not sure what you mean by a glowing sign Oh My god, dude fast 64 why it keeps changing this to i8 when it clearly cannot be an i8 And get even bigger the problem is the bigger we make it the faster it is going to move And Let's resume detection Yeah, I think you might be right x-links Hmm, yeah, I will try something similar to what you're saying So we're going to be taking this Let's make it like 256 by 256 We take like a small portion of it's how do I do that without adding seems everywhere Yeah Good enough for the tips I Make the stress less bright bigger and with different sizes and also intensity in the area in which you want to have special part Hmm They got we can do that Different sizes that's gonna be difficult if you make it bigger cuz like now we don't have enough space on it actually do different sizes And same with intensity levels And That does look kinda neat but they're moving so much slower it already looks a lot better I Have a cream teamer There's also this effect here, which I like a lot Yeah, stupidly large is better Now I just need to actually cut out the stupidly large part in a way where it doesn't look like shit What if I'm a good spot. Maybe this here I think that is a good spot. Let's get those three stars in here Try to delete this one here I Don't why is it why is my brush so weird someone can tell me why do I have to drag it like this? I Don't like it. How do I fix it? It was moving I guess that doesn't make it better So we take these three and we take 64 by 64 pixels out of here somehow Yeah Please Do Do It should work right am I crazy for thinking that this will work I Should make it seamless if it wasn't for the stupid brightness. Oh, yeah, that's god damn it Okay, how do I fix that You Don't need the expansion packs that allow to like that deals improvements the Expansion makes like an extra 4% performance boost Alright, let's do this again, but without that mistake You Are those two no, those are the three I picked right are they not And if you pick these four here I Want something that doesn't look like it's obviously tiling nice fazey what's on the bottom left? Now there's too much star in there But if you put like put like like something like this And then We do this and this And The rest of the star goes Here But that that looks like it could work I Mean it's a new brick thing texture and I don't even know how it works. So it might be useless, but it doesn't matter Let's see what you got for me easy. I Sent it to isolation funny square brick Okay Isn't this very similar to what I already have here No, I don't think it's gonna work unfortunately Hello 0-1 left Dory How come you only had bunny brush was playable in the demo and not all on the bubble? I'm gonna give Chris this time. Are you still making chains, or do you just want to reveal too much? I Did not want to reveal too much The purpose of the demo is to get feedback on Mario's physics and the camera So putting in more into the demo than just course one one distracts from the purpose it makes it harder to maintain the demo and to it like There's no point to it and I don't want to reveal more than I have to I Think it's fixable What why is my button combo not working hello there we go okay i'm confused either way let's try that again wait a second i have combiner space left i have combiner space left we need to make use of this it needs to be a 64x64 i think 32x32 is hopeless because it's gonna move too fast i was just wondering the reason let's take this one yeah that was a good reason the the feedback i got on the survey was also very useful i think making the survey was like a banger idea very fortunate i added that it's the only thing i wanted yeah a lot of people asked for that um there's of course a problem that like as soon as you make it see the point actually is that you can make like very slight angle adjustments you get like you're walking at the right angle uh so the problem is soon as i like the speed too high from default that purpose is broken so okay but that's why maybe an option is fine i was thinking maybe like an option that's like c button camera controls where it's like discrete slow medium and fast maybe and discrete is like how it is right now and then slow is what the d-pad does god why does that have to look so shit why does it just have to be like the worst thing ever ugh that is so sad why did it not look like that before i don't understand why did it not look like so bad before what are you trying to do i'm trying to make this look somewhat reflective without actually using an nth map because if i use an nth map i can't use a texture and if i can't use a texture then there's no detail and looks like shit that's what i'm trying to do what's your solution bro the bokeh blur version hello voicel see the idea is to get this effect but i just can't pull it off this looked so much better i think the main difference here is that there's like specs where it doesn't get reflected but i have those two right we have like these things here maybe i need to increase the contrast of brightness of this one here i don't know if it improves it or not i mean i guess kinda we make the light darker the light probably has to be darker just for the purpose of like having it be more substantial oh but there's okay right now the off that the light is influenced by that and it's additive what if you use texture zero color here x1 alpha and primitive color alpha here and then oh huh oh right it would have to be zero again i want a small additive component to this though oh my god that's weird what if i use shade colors the additive component here and i just look all of it it kinda works let's try it in game if you make the building dark purple wait why purple who's saying purple i think it's a difference because this time you're literally playing with white against black so it's hard to make it look subtle no i think the reason it's so bad is because we use an i4 texture and i4 only has 16 substeps so you'd see all this color bending the very very obvious color bending so or you mean because the backdrop of the building is black rather than a different color oh okay i see what you mean now i don't like how dirty the texture looks and how repetitive the texture looks but that's fixable let's revert to an earlier texture here i think that looks decent uh we can try to make this purple real quick um i don't think purple is a good idea for this level but just for the sake of experiment we can make this like dark purple oops yeah purple also just doesn't have the vibe i want i think i think this is closer to the color i want let's just try mine but why is a it doesn't work this one here all right let's try it but you didn't even put the angles in like there's no angling of the thing what about the square but i'll try it oh  it is kind of nice i have to admit dang oh but you made it to 64 by 64 so i guess it has to be an i8 here make the squares larger i'm okay like so oh i thought this looked cool let's try it so yeah that's way nicer than what i had before but why i don't understand why is this better no i don't like this i don't like that it's better i mean i'm happy with it but i don't like it so i think the star should be twice as big let's try that you know it works but yeah it's like the brightness of the texture pixel that you have is going to be how much light is going to be reflected in that pixel so if you make it black there's going to be no light reflected let's go  that is kind of sick looking though i do kind of like it now so okay maybe you can't do that we can do this so um about the boss fight so there is a boss fight in this and it's gonna be over there on the factory and me and Biobak we have been talking about a little bit the boss fight is basically the thing we have to like do next or plan out next so that's why the factory is there we've been talking about it we were thinking it should be like a mutated yoshi so at first we were thinking like a monster with tentacles but since it's like a shy guy civilization and shy guys and yoshis are like natural enemies for some reason on yoshi's island but it was like a mutated yoshi with like 10 tongues and then like the tongues attack you tentacle monster yeah the idea of this is that this is like very vertical and full of stuff there's still going to be a lot of platforming like around here like over there and stuff the shy guy mask and the red cloak it's gonna be like a big giant yoshi i don't know about the shy guy i mean if he has a mask how's he gonna taunt you i think Biobak as a boss just like Biobak straight up no modifications just him so the idea was that he would also like attack with tentacles out of black holes let me let me see what Biobak would do here Biobak did draw something here but he sent me this idea here before that's like a thing in yoshi's island go read that he said i'm 100% down for a tentacle yoshi oh god do not google tentacle yoshi okay tongues that you pull and then they snap back in his face like a rubber band would be funny yeah we had an idea in that direction this is true the only reason i hate pc port is because i have no soul actually i've seen it comes on yoshi going to attack stick his tongue out or what yeah yeah we have to think about that me when i think wait how do we have 160 viewers what did i miss why okay this is actually a thing that i'm concerned about my second channel getting popular um i'm a little scared that there's too many people watching my second channel because it's just like me posting whatever the fuck i feel like and there's like no editing or anything it's like too private for the public you know that's how it feels like i thought this was just gonna be my stream chat but now my stream chat's giant i'm not telling you guys to leave but you know radioactive eggs like the shy guy corrupted yoshi was the last one tongue exits instead of bullets but the idea is that the sky guys here they're not actually shy guys they're sky guys they have they're scared of him and um when you enter this level okay you enter this level right here and you see the boss over here and then you look at the monitors and the monitors is like a sky guy news broadcast morning of the boss and everyone's like barricaded in their house yes this is course 15 and fix the lore no it's such a good lore so i would love to will tend to be yoshi to get some inspiration but i feel like i can't show that on stream i cannot show that on stream why are you helping the skies you you're not their enemies the whole time you're just beating the yoshi i missed the ball in the hard stuff oh yeah he's he's quite the mutated yoshi so i'm googling you why is that showing up he was from partners in time yes we already have boshi this is the thousandth time you've shown on instagram what can i do see okay the weirdest thing is one time i needed the blimp with bowser's design so i googled bowser blimp and it's all weird inflation fetish stuff either way the idea for the boss fight big mutated yoshi i like how you looks big fat yoshi perfect black holes should be in this somehow there is the fortnight rift like this imagine this but there's like yoshi tongues coming out of it i think that would work um how do we make this work do i really want to program like eight tongues just for Flying around attacking that's a human moshi i'm not sure if there are any other obscure yoshi variants besides like yoshi with wings whenever you mess with the space universe demo it plays the yoshi story game with him no lessee fetish that's terrible ultramascope in the game i was thinking little yachty will be in the game factory yoshi he attacks with his tongue how can we have him grow tongues everywhere i don't think so do we go with the yoshi if it's a tentacle monster the tentacle monster can put like his arms into the portals and then the arms come out of the part of the tag in any test yoshi boss when it will be done also we are not yi y so what the hell i think the yoshi has a bit of the problem that if we were to use the black walls then it's gonna be a bit weird but what if it's just like his face and there's like three tongues coming out of his face and you have to fight them somehow sounds kind of like goober blooper i guess he grabs him by his tongue and flings it up and slaps him why would he do that it's not a concept for a boss fight that's one attack you need to do the most coarse thing you can do first and then zoom in on the details but right now we don't even have a coarse thing that even halfway works so we cannot zoom in on details turn into a lesser gaming insert okay but we still have nothing how do you even damage you can't no you just you're giving me random details this is useless maybe i should just ignore chat while i do this i mean that's not completely useless it's gonna be useful if we actually go forward with the idea and we have a fun way of doing that but we don't have to right now are the only areas you can see yeah it would be kind of like that like you mutated yoshi you can also be like a very big yoshi and like it's like a shadow of the colossus type boss fight i cannot put banana cat in here i think it would be more fun to like engage with the boss directly instead of from so far away so what if it's a big walking yoshi in the middle and his attack is he has three tongues that all come out and you're going and you have to jump on his tongue like gooper blooper to like flatten it on the ground and then slap them with rubber bands which is also gooper blooper and this boss fight is just gooper blooper and i don't like that what would it be a story behind the yoshi getting mutated he's in space there's radiation but a mutated yoshi boss fight is just so cool what is the most of this level we're thinking more than right now the first idea was a space squid with tentacles that attacks you could absolutely have the yoshi like wait what if it had a guitar with like one of those mouse at the front that like grab you and then he goes um and he eats you and he chews you and that does like a shit ton of damage and most of the fighters seem like walking around normally and like ground pounding you and stuff like he jumped above you and does a ground pound and that maybe like spawns shockwaves and then we just need a way to damage him i think that would be really fun can we blow up last hmm with a set camera this would kind of work but i don't like that you don't directly fight the boss it's more like you're fighting him indirectly yeah like a tongue that has a mouth should be like a darkling fight yeah yeah that's also kind of what i'm thinking very slow moving yoshi i'm just thinking about the way you damage him because if it is the big yoop if it's this guy here and he's just like three times the size of mario so you could still reasonably like climbing and stuff that would work and he would be really slow and he would like ground pound you and spawn like shockwaves and then when he leaves he'll still give mutated tongue obviously it's not gonna be yoop but like a different mutated yoshi i don't know i don't know pizza tower i don't like the idea of him like tipping and then ground pounding his belly that's been done too many times do i use a giant costume what is this i should just i should not get tilted don't get tilted it's my fault for reacting the easiest way to damage him would be to build like spikes and then he damages himself by like ground pounding the spikes i think there's a mega lag fight he wouldn't be this big now he would be much smaller it'd be more like a bowser fight let me think is there any bowser fight like what i'm thinking what's the king k rogue fight in dk64 let me look at that dude is there any fight in this is this just cut scenes but yeah this vibe is pretty similar it's basically this here why can't you meet you for things why if you want to live out your poorly disguised fetish then please do it somewhere else but yeah this is pretty similar to what i want i have a really good internet i guess the bowser fight is also pretty similar wait what if you do fight him like bowser you could absolutely grab his tail he could still be using black holes somehow how would he use black holes maybe like creates a black hole jumps into it and then comes back out somewhere i mean mario could grab his tail and then he's like really difficult to throw like much more difficult than bowser and when he falls down he falls into like a black hole and comes back out he could absolutely do that rayman 3 final boss let me see that in my charge attack also doable i'm not gonna be quite this size here does anyone have any muted yoshis it's funny i kind of like this but we can do practically anything we want we should use some references from the level itself there's these energy tanks here it could be like a mutant and yoshi with some of these energy drinks on his back and you like have to ground on all of them and that's how you beat him that yoshi could also like roll into a boulder and attack you like that wait okay think about this it is going to be something like this fucking guy here it's going to be very big he is his attacks are going to be a ground pound that creates shock waves the tongue that like licks you up and like eats you and then spits you back out then he's gonna roll up into a ball and he's gonna go and he's gonna go into a black hole and then a black hole appears somewhere else and after a few seconds the yoshi comes out of it kind of like the ganon boss fight in twilight princess and that's how he attacks you and the way you attack him is you get on his back and he has like energy cells on the back and you like ground pound him the only issue i have with that is that how you're gonna figure out to punch those i think that would work well um you can get them from romeo king and conglomerate that should be pretty safe yeah it's got some beast ganon influence there the ground pound symbol on the tanks it's a little very on the nose don't you think the arena would definitely have to be a bit bigger um yeah there will be more galaxy deconvolution one day eventually ai is going to be able to do most of them like in the automatically and that's when there's going to be a deconvolution i think the eggers spin into it oh you mean he literally just becomes an egg it's like an attack wait he could have eggs on his back and you crack his axe to kill him that kind of works yeah it's kind of a basic idea i mean the fun of it is like the set piece of it right because like he looks very cool but i feel like that's not enough for a boss fight to work i don't know maybe it makes him sad then he gets sick because he's so sad about his children dying the raven is basically final well he would be spawning in black holes everywhere i'm just worrying a bit about the camera here because the camera might be very annoying in a boss fight that just teleports around like that so that'd have to be a lot of delay and a good sound effect and some light maybe hello cypex you can probably make the a.i figure stuff out by itself if you just give it the compiler and you can go like one try to match it i guess i mean you can already do chess i don't see why programming would be so much more difficult i do like the moon in the background i like the building now asa's texture actually made it look good so him rolling into a ball should kind of work maybe that's where his weakness should be he should probably just shake you off if you land on the snout he's just gonna move and then you fly away so probably what you would want to do is like you go behind the yoshi right because he's like very slow and obviously that's how you would beat such a big monster and maybe on his way back there's like a way to get on his back like on his on his tail you can just get up on his tail and then walk to his the top what if we do the thwomp thing where they just have like a band-aid on the back of their of the thing i don't know if i like that i also don't really like him using these energy he's not gonna do a spin jump he's gonna do a ground pound for the shock waves trick him into eating eggs i mean he doesn't even really necessarily have eggs he would likely have those yoshi spikes on his back pulsating tumors hmm that's that's an idea maybe that is the way to go i mean he's a mutant right mutants would have pulsating tumors that would make him look more mutancy so you ground pound like all his pulsating tumors to kill him fucked up yoshi with pulsating tumors um he has a mouth on his tongue that he grabs you with and then eats you he does the spin attack to like attack you and he uses black holes now we're not putting mario in a mecha one important ground rule for this is that most of the time you will stay mario end up with the same physics that's important for me i feel like he isn't big enough to eliminate the whole skyway village oh yoshi's so scary bye lizard from sonic adventure no we can't we can't do a sonic adventure reference again my game is already full of them I'm not just putting an evil clone of Mario. That's actually just just Wario. Wait, what you're just suggesting me to put Mario here Well, I was hoping it wouldn't be mushy but I guess it is I'm machine. What do you think of this effect here? I stole it from the real But I like it a lot It's in the final no, no boss was going to be based of Sonic And Mario follow him through the black hole that's also something I found about that's actually one thing I'm worried about like How are we gonna? The logic that Mario can't go through the black bolts, why would that be a thing, right? There's no good months, it's all just guy guys The raising orange beams, oh that's the low gravity zone. I Was talking about the reflection on the rock here and the stone See Oh gravity area. I Might put like a metal thing at the bottom to watch it that Nope when you make the hub won't last that's just reasonable game design I Think the Pulsating Mutated Little spots would be the best idea The cancer grows on Yoshi because he's such a mutant. Yes cancer grows everywhere. That's what mutants do Oh You like the visuals of this I don't like the results of the set at all. I think the level doesn't look very good yet. I Mean there's some good ideas here and there but it's much improbable I Love carnage Couple gods, let's see that. Oh Yeah, he has also has these grows here But instead of killing the Yoshi you heal it oh, it's an interesting idea But what happens yeah, yeah, actually that makes a lot more sense cuz like the sky guys are like the enemies, right So obviously you wouldn't want to help them and the Yoshi's are your friends Okay, wait, let's let's think about that one So there okay, what if you just destroy the tumors and that like makes him happy and he's like wow, thanks for helping me Sorry, I was in such a bad mood that I attacked you You know what? I mean With last story no and we're glad you're the evil guy Yeah, I know tea time and I've acknowledged it but I didn't have a good idea about that either And how are you dealing? Well, if you destroy the tumors then you heal this cancer clearly Wouldn't you want your cancer healed? And we can even do some cool effects that I can make him go from like a weird mutated purple color back to like the normal Yoshi green And then he's like wow, that's so nice of you Thank you for helping me I will now go back to my hometown and then he opens a black hole and leaves and a star comes out of it That's a bang idea I think we'll do that So this deviant that guy is going to be like what an honor Imagine being this guy on deviantART and Like aren't you my eyebrows up and he released this like what two years ago and then he sees this Oh my god, dude, my thing became famous A more pacifistic idea of defeating the boss. I mean destroying his tumors, but yeah, I see what you mean Cancer isn't curable that makes no sense. Space cancer is curable There's one more issue here and that is that I want Everyone to be scared of the space Yoshi when you enter here So at first the idea was that we'd have blobs and that would be small blobs like everywhere around the level But I don't have that anymore so what will be around the level Maybe like baby versions of this Yoshi or something. How would we justify that though? How does that make any sense? Answer cells I have no idea Kobayashi. Obviously each extra pixel is gonna reduce the frame rate I'm targeting 30. So obviously would go below 30 Attacks so Hmm Mmm  Around him Me to be or hit this and some roast Smaller use could work. They could throw X X level X They could definitely be like evil versions of the space yoshi gif somehow Yeah, slightly mutated yoshi for sure um Keep this in mind How do you make a simple version of that? I guess it would almost just be like Maybe we would like remove the front legs and the big thing here and would almost just be like a walking yoshi face But you would kill all his children man, that's so mean I don't want the player to kill his children and then to heal him. That's nasty Is If the goal is to heal him if it's like gross then the enemies here should be kind of gross, right It's like cancer is gross should somehow be the enemies I'd make that an enemy In danger x So Okay, what if the baby yoshis also all have a growth and like when you punch them or like on them The growth just kind of like explodes And they make like a happy animation and jump down They just jump down open the black hole for a second and then disappear and you get like five coins or something That's like the best idea I have Like a swamp art, let me see Yeah, that's that's pretty close to what I want I will keep this as a reference Okay Oh My god, that's the link. Okay. I need a different link That confused me So Yeah, so we have okay, so the mutated baby yoshis would be very simple and they'd have like one big growth somewhere and the big growth would have Like a scrolling glowing thing like scrolling into it So like you can see it's having the life force of the yoshis and maybe they have like eyes with no pupil before and then once you destroy it, they grow three pupils and so it's like um baby yoshis around the map and during the boss fights um mutated yoshis no forearms and uh Fat face walking on two stumps With a growth on their back, no pupils until you destroy their growth Then you destroy their growth They make a happy animation Get their pupils, change their color Disappear into a black hole Scrolling a little bit down Well, if you're noticing the goombas needing some kind of cure that they still need to do Yeah, yeah, I I am working on improving that Wall kicks being too easy is like a crazy point. I mean wall kicks were never difficult And I mean, they were only difficult if you're like really really bad at Mario 64 at that point It's kind of a disability issue only right? So You plan on meeting a marmot of his final boss, nope, i'm done with that game It's called super mario 32 as i'm making everything with 32-bit instruction because 64-bit instructions suck We might modify the baby yoshi map Um Hmm Are we missing anything? So the baby yoshis teach you to kill the growths I think the boss fight might be a little boring and easy Um, how do they attack you they attack by Hopping like you and making new pressure map And explosions, um, I can see why So Walking around them is probably fun There's just something we need to do to make it difficult at first to walk around them and then easy over time The problem I see right now is that you're just gonna walk around them and nothing's going to happen And wing goombas I don't see the relation of wing goombas to this boss, unfortunately So You mind this is return to yoshi's island we like shy guys here are they even goombas in yoshi's island I don't actually know Yes, this game needs a rem expansion I am too lazy to make it work without it So Okay, it's kind of his mouth to fight you But this guy guys will help you find the yoshi if anything Maybe you can like spit acid around him or something Or like acid puddles, yeah, there should be like acid puddles around the boss Let's do that Spit acid puddles into the floor Mario has to dodge those or take damage And then that makes like some of the boss fights Be a little bit of platforming Don't you have a spiky tail Playing as a goombas cosplaying really is that confirmed? I don't think so When you use a power up to cure his cancer like a custom doctor clock I don't see it We do have power-ups in this game that we could use we have the ice cap the wing cap the cloud cap And the bomb cap So Yes goombas in Yoshi's Island, oh it's good because I put goombas in this game It'd be very Very awkward if there were no goombas in Yoshi's Island This game is full of shy guys Really how does the goomba Yoshi's Island look like? Oh They are so rare Only in one level So You can have an area where you're just gonna mess with all the powers, I don't know I haven't planned it Yeah, loombas are cringe So  But then it spikes to his tail and do something with that That's gonna make him spin slower all the time I guess maybe the way Maybe he like always Rotates at mario And the only way to make him stop rotating Is if he attacks somehow So he might attack with the tongue which is gonna be difficult to do He might attack with the acid which is gonna have a lot of a cool down or he might attack by putting on children Like maybe you can just spit up the children maybe he throws eggs at you and the eggs hatch the children Yeah So Throwing an egg in the egg that she is in the Yoshi enemy And she might loop around and climb his back He always rotates at you, so the only way to get to his back fast enough is to wait for him to do an attack. Okay, how is this getting more difficult over time? Um... Now we have a way to do the difficulty. The problem is, it seems pretty easy to always just dodge it. Baby Yoshis. Yeah, they're like mutated Sky Baby Yoshis, basically. No, no Metal Cap here. The only old power-up that's gonna be there is the Wing Cap, because I think that's the only good one. The Metal Cap is very stylish, but I don't like how it acts like a key. I don't know what's happening. That sounds like an emulator bug. I don't program emulator. Ask the emulator developer. Hmm, maybe we can do something in the arena to make this doable? Or it could be like, after you damage him for the first time, the asset already exists. Like, he takes damage, turns into a ball, goes into a black hole, spends asset from the top. I think that could kinda work. So... Let's just... Go into a ball to throw Mario off. Go into a black hole. Comes from the top with a shadow that slowly gets solid. Hmm... When you land, throw asset upwards. Throw asset and eggs upwards. Can you dodge that? I guess you can. Something like that should work. Arena breaks apart. Hmm, that's not a terrible idea. We can also do the whole arena in a way where it's like... Well, that's the next consideration. What do we make the arena like? I just had the idea, maybe it's like in a hexagon pattern. And you jump between the hexagons. Hmm... A hexagon pattern would work pretty well, I think. I guess not quite. But something similar to a hexagon would work here. Hmm... First of all, remove this wall here. That's gonna make this too difficult to work with if it keeps being here. Same with this, that needs to go. So... Hmm... First of all, the arena needs to be bigger. Like so. Then we have something like this. Hmm... Nope, not what I wanted. I wanted this. Hmm... There's this Digimon Adventure anime remake, basically. Like the first Digimon thing. And all the Digimon battles there, it's just like... Them standing far away from each other and shooting beams at each other. Because making them interact with each other is like too much animation budget. And I feel like a lot of boss fights work in a similar way. But making the player interact with the boss in a way that doesn't suck balls is too difficult. So they just do that. That's a funny parallel to me. Hmm... I'm not doing anything with X-Corp, but Alox said he might wanna do it. So leave him be. Like, talk to him. Leave me alone. Talk to him. I want nothing to do with that. People have been so insistent and annoying about the PC port. That at this point, out of pure stubbornness, I want nothing to do with it. Even if I could see a use case for it, I would be like, no. Just because everyone's been so goddamn annoying about it. I was thinking of actually doing that, Alox, just like a really easy OPC port. But I bet it already exists, and I bet people love it. There was one time I put a realistic face texture on Toad, and said, look, I'm on the PC port now. And people were like, ha ha ha, you're so jealous of the PC port. Ha ha ha, you're just not good enough to make a PC port tag. And it's like... God. Okay, that's enough.  Why are they so insufferable? How do they do it? Hello, super redstone. I have legitimately heard people be like, well, the only reason people wouldn't want to use the PC port is because they're just not good programmers. They just can't do it. It is so crazy. Okay. What does ex-coop even mean? What's different from ex-coop and just coop? For the record, I think the PC port project was kinda cool. I mean, it was made as a cool novelty. I just don't think it's the end-all be-all. And I'm also not interested in modding it. I'm just annoyed people expect me to mod it. It's like... Formula 1 racing. Imagine you as a normal person in your day-to-day life. Maybe you drive a car. But while you drive your car, all the time people come up to you and be like, why aren't you doing Formula 1 racing? And that's just happening every single day to you. Like, every single day people ask you, why aren't you Formula 1 racing? And it's like, do you want to be Formula 1 racing? What's the point of this? I'm trying to get groceries. Does that make sense? Well, DX has updated ex-coop, basically, as you saw with the PC. Okay. I heard they have object sync too, which is very cool. I think this works well as an arena. It is kind of like a hexagon pattern, but like a fucked up one. Sounds annoying as hell, it is. Hmm.  Oh, I would probably make a good amount of money if I used the PC part for my stuff. I don't think it really matters what I do. But it's not, like, ironic for the money anyway. I just want to make a cool N64 game. Hmm. Hmm. God, the garden grid is so annoying. There we go. That's so much better. Hehe. Yeah, if you like YouTubers, never meet your heroes. Especially if you're a minor. Sorry. Could not resist. Hmm. Oh, when you can't scan, I trust you. I might, like, stab you and steal your money, but other than that, I'm very trustworthy. Are the top levels imported in-game or not? I mean, let us. Obviously the letters are not imported into the game. Hehe. Okay, I think that's a terrible idea to use this texture here. But overall, this factory design can work. And I realize this spin attack is probably not going to look very good here. Because, like, yeah. Maybe he shouldn't have a spin attack. Maybe he should just disappear into a black hole. I think the spin attack is not going to work. Okay. So he has to be able to go to different areas here. There is not banjo music in my game. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. You mean to trust me IRL? I don't think you would kill me IRL, Fazana. Yes, I trust you that much. I wouldn't let you sleep in my basement. If you were homeless. And it was, like, ice cold outside. Okay, since the spin attack is no longer working, ground pound is good. What if these platforms are movable? What if we can, like, make them fall down? Hmm. That doesn't seem to be a point. That. Never mind, I don't like it. Is he always going to be in the middle? Probably, right? But then, he can't really do a grub hunt. So maybe he's not always in the middle. He's always in the middle, but sometimes he's in the middle. I don't think I called you Farzana. Hello, handsome male. Did you think I was gone? I was here all the time. I was here every Saturday. Yeah, he is doing shark waves. Maybe there's more to getting him stuck. Because right now it seems like you're doing a lot of running in a circle here. Chip, chip, chip. And then he throws Yoshis or something at you. Or acid. I guess the further you are behind him, the slower he gets. That makes sense. The larger the angle is from him facing you, the greener the angle behind him, the slower he should get so that you aren't stuck and you're not stuck. I mean, I can skip the song if it's that bad. I guess you can use a game shirt game. It's the same melody over and over again. Fine. Is this the same thing too? Okay, Mario Kart energetic music to study work fast. How about that? I think we're good with leaving this like this for now. And we can move on. Let's add some lights here. Just the lights That just worked. Okay, cool. Honestly, I get it. I'm not the biggest fan of bench music either. No, he's still at the ground pump. I don't know where you got that texting the ground pump idea from. I just made some notes on how it works. Make sure it doesn't break the fact. So we can move on. Of course, the boss is not going to spin jump. He's like, he doesn't have the body shape for it. You know, you can't just go on spin jumping if you look like that. I was a developer and released this game by what happened. I would probably make a lot of money. We are at 4000 triangles here. Nice. Will you ever be time fitting for you to use the golden iOS background music for a stream? Yes. That would be a thing I would do. I usually decide the OSD at the start of the stream and then that's what I do for the rest of the stream. Can I get out of your waltz? Nope. Can you stay where you are Sonic the Hedgehog? They don't want you ruining people's games again. Okay. And the lights make this look a million times better instantly. That's not true at all. You don't think the lights make it look better? Bummer. Meow meow meow meow meow meow. I had a moment. I wonder how this would look if I added the light to it. It's kinda nice, kinda ass. I think it should be something like that maybe. Just slap a bunch of text onto a quad and move it with the camera. You don't particularly like spaghetti. True. I don't like spaghetti. I don't like spaghetti. I don't know what I'm talking about. I just make a game. Y'all are talking about some weird stuff. Okay, this is an interesting case. This is a scroll... Nevermind, that's a stupid idea. Wait, no, that's not a stupid idea. This is a scrolling light and it could go like bright and dark over and over and I think it would look really good with that. Check discord DMs. Oh, no, no, no, I'm not using an OST for a course. Or what do you mean? Are you saying I should listen to this while working or are you saying I should use this for the level? Oh, God, I scrolled all the way up chat. BG music while working on the level. Okay. Definitely not putting this as music on the level, unfortunately, because I want an all custom OST. What is your Twitch case? Um, I don't know. Let me make game. I'm not a big fan. What the fuck happened here? Let's see. I make it a game. Oh, this is weird. I guess that was a bug from before. Good thing I caught that. Okay. If you look at this, the skybox here, including the moon. It's actually super small. It's probably no further than the end of this platform here. In reality, it just starts at where the camera is, and then it moves with the camera, but like 99% of the cameras movement. Elite developer besides Nintendo. What does that mean? Would it be like making a game for Nintendo? I mean, I probably would want to do that. That sounds fun. The only issue with that is like I wouldn't be able to trust them. You know, I would think that as soon as I accept that and like walk into office, I get like killed at work. They will just murder me. What happened here? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. I think those are my only options. That's floating too. Is it not? Oh, it appears to be floating because it's clipping into it. I see, I see. Idiot fell for it, Mr. Miyoto. We can kill him now. Yeah, I think the glow effects work really, really well now. Man, it's making this glow look shitty. The problem with this glow is here, I can't really make it any brighter. I know, it sounds like a stupid thing to say, but literally it's not possible to make this any brighter with this effect. Maybe that Dorian wishes to have Miyamoto's face texture in the Chaos Compact? What? That's crazy. I mean, it makes sense. If I'm supposed to be the villain of the Chaos Compact, why would Miyamoto be there? I just wanted to make a fun game with the wahoo men. I mean, there's nothing illegal with what I'm doing, right? Why would doing this be illegal? Okay, I think I like this idea now. Next, infiltrate the rocket. So we have to make the rocket look decent. Right now the rocket is just a big slab of polygons. We didn't actually try to make it look like a rocket. But honestly, I'm feeling a little done with streaming for today. So we're gonna continue this another time. There's a good chance I will be able to stream on Thursday? Tuesday? But I'm not 100% sure. I'll have to see how that works out with my workout and everything. So until then, bye bye! Sorry, I had to practice my lines.
