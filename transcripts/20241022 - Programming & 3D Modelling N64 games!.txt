You that one million is happy god damn you wanna spend all your money on me a million what you need one million oh it's no longer my birthday i need to edit the name hello mario luigi sm64 hello verza a million you did get pulled one million a million what you need one million is that big god damn you wanna spend all your money god damn you wanna spend all your money on me a million what you need one million god damn you wanna spend all your money on me it's a bit weird how the light on this looks hello josh hello smudge a million i don't understand why this one is so dark compared to the top one god damn you wanna spend all your money on me a million what you need one million is happy there we go that's better hello dycomax you know so i'm gonna try a different stream concept today my priority today is not on entertaining but rather on getting work done which you know it always is but this time even more so you're in speaker be careful um shit if i knew your real name i would warn your parents of what you're planning to do to them sorry i couldn't resist  no entertainment entertainment today will be coincidental which i think is how my streams should be anyway so my screen died hold on damn that was lucky for you lila hello yek i mean if your job is in the entertainment industry then watching someone work is entertainment yes this is accurate information hello tea time okay once i move that up i think we're good i should add the ability to reduce the spring strength so what do you think of the new styrofoam i think it looks a lot better now it was my birthday two days ago mishi the title was from last stream so dude this is so cute look at this little snow landscape the styrofoam suddenly fits in so much better we're just gonna put more snow over this there's gonna be snowballs coming from the front and you from here and he's gonna stab you this is gonna be one kind of difficult jump but i think it's fine for quiz 14 and you pick up the crayon here and then you use the spring there's gonna be a button here that spawns a bridge tempo rally and you gotta be fast to walk over the bridge here i still need to program the bridge and you need to time with the snowball here so that you can go here and you try not to die to him and then you finally arrived where you can draw with the crayon so you know what i love the most about this it actually ends up looking like a crayon drawing once you're done here look at it this does look like someone's shitty crayon drawing like they couldn't follow the lines correctly yeah it doesn't have the audio visuals implemented yet you know there will definitely be particles and sound too hey mushi what do you think of the new hut? you like it? i swapped the coins and the yoshi coins from last time i tried to make a hat that is like mauri 64 but improved so the textures look the same but the colors are like a little better just more clarity the edges are anti-aliased some yoshi eggs new red coins um no red coins still exist i can show you the difference it's a good course to show the difference yo thank you for the twitch prime money who who gifted that i'm sorry i can't see it i'm sorry i can't see it wrong bro thank you thank you all right i'll show you the difference in this level here so red coins in this game are always contained to one area because otherwise red coins suck so red coins are all in this chump cage here right and you get them by like out maneuvering the chump and the yoshi coins you get them for really rare special interactions so you have to do things that others would not really think of or go places that you usually wouldn't go to so for example for one yoshi coin here you can buy a snack for dory and then bring it to dory and you get a yoshi coin when i say blue sky doesn't have a kc's in him i take the chance later i actually made a blue sky account today what is this awful song i went back to 1 million mr beast i don't know if this actually still works come on dory eat your snack oh yeah it works that's how it works yeah exactly they are they are stored globally they're like mini objectives that don't run on stars but like they are something special you do basically and then some are in tricky situation uh tricky locations like i think one was up here um no i actually have no idea how to get up there no idea where they are in this level cool where the fuck did i put the yoshi coins did i put one to the sleeping goomba here yeah there's one hidden by the sleeping goomba here so they are kind of east exia and um another change i made in mushi that is not in vanilla mario 64 is there's seven acts now and once you have the first six stars you get the seventh star which is just find the egg coins and find the egg coins has this radar here visible that unfortunately doesn't work because i have all the egg coins but that would be like a blinking that changes depending on how close you are to the egg coin so that way you actually find them pretty easily and you get all the special interactions Biobak did rework the zoo ones yes and of course 100 coins touched are just gone and basically with the system i wanted to solve the issue that there's no reason to explore like all the nooks and crannies in a level and um there's the thing this consistently happens in every mario 64 i get play where it's like i tried to get a star and then i have like 50 coins i'm like oh i might as well get the 100 coins star now and then i walk into a star and i'm like well i can't collect the star because i only have 50 coins i would lose all my coins and that just feels like shit so they are completely different every time and you only get them on the seventh star which means the first six stars you are just completely exploring the level three four and you're gonna find three or four coins normally and then for the last two you're on a treasure hunt with a radar and i think that's pretty cool rita okay i would like you to make that hike instead of me does that sound do we have a deal so so yeah i mean secrets are secrets have an interesting component to them where it's like you have to guess what the thing is that they have in common the secrets which i think is kind of a cool mechanic it's it's kind of like a game show where it's like yes what i'm thinking of and i think that's actually kind of cool compared to like normal rats whereas red coins a lot of the time are really boring if you look at reds and like cool for mountain or bomb on battlefield they suck and let me guess so if everything is red conditions yeah bomb lips forest had a good red condition too oh yeah also if you collect only red coins the star that spawns it never kicks you out of the level same with the yoshi coin star it never kicks you out also a big change i think the thing is the way i designed the game a lot of surf stars have to kick you out because otherwise you would just be stuck in the dead end and i don't want to put arbitrary pipes everywhere so i can't do this for more missions and a lot of missions are also like story relevance so i didn't want to introduce a system where the player would have to guess whether he's going to get kicked out so i made a pretty simple system where it's like red coins just don't kick you out and yoshi coins does kick you out basically any collect text y star doesn't kick you out no level has a 100 coin star not a single one so okay wait i've gotta i've gotta do an important thing real quick so you may have heard of the vimstaller takedown and um i thought i just had evidence that they were fake but vim is saying that he's very sure that they're legitimate he is vim a girl i did not know so so what i was thinking for the global consist that you can buy stuff on the overworlds to like advance the game um but for the demo we don't really have anything There so what I was thinking for the demo is there's just gonna be one guy that's very simple we're just gonna be like usually like coins are global you're supposed to use them on people but none of them have arrived yet so instead of using them for something useful you can gift me your coins and I will buy myself a new hat and then you can give him coins and you do that three times that he upgrades from bronze to silver to gold hat and that's it you get nothing the guy just gets a cool hat you think that works for the demo I think it's perfect for a demo and I will literally give the player nothing for doing it other than a new hat for the guy oh this causes that huh I don't know how I haven't noticed that before 3D text huh do you mean this text here? that's annotations for the level I have to make hello Biobak the 3d text that says snowball will not be in the game do not worry text that I'm pulling out, shit, you think I should low polygonize it? maybe decimate it to 0.05 decimated thing of the fall right? true, philip wraith is going to die Biobak what do you think of the new styrofoam? your opinion here matters I changed it a little bit I like it a lot more now I also really like this just the scene, the way this looks it's giving me cozy vibes you know what I mean I also think this is appropriately difficult platforming for course 14 now like having to do this this and then something like that seems appropriate to me what's the snow made out of? I googled cardboard house craft and I saw a bunch of stuff that looks like this I imagine it's some kind of cream I wasn't really questioning it because I couldn't figure it out but it all looked like this so I just made this dude what is this garbage song again? I'm gonna listen to 1 million Mr. Beast like 10 hours how do you put a YouTube video on repeat? there we go what about the health bar is that better? I don't know you already looped it don't worry you guys being in the middle of that looks much better than the coin counter being there I agree that's why I watched them the too small part width of the house certainly faces the other ledge you need to reach but it's a nitpick I'm also gonna move this back a little bit just because I don't want the player to land on here and slide immediately also looks a little less monotonous show health meter please it looks the same as  so the bridge I'm still not sure what I'm gonna do for the bridge and for the snowball spawner for the bridge I was thinking just like a piece of cardboard comes out of the the styrofoam thing although I'm not 100% sure I like that I could cut a hole in here and then have it look a little more realistic make a rough draft of the demo okay it's gonna be a bit before I make the demo thing because I have a video about BLJ coming up then I have a video about the fuck am I doing on this channel coming up and then the demo release so the demo release is gonna be in a few weeks I think and until then we're still gonna make improvements to the game that's why I don't want to finalize the demo yet popsicle bridge is too poorly yeah I'm gonna make a demo of just course one again machine it's just gonna be there to show people the improvements that have been made since the last demo basically some people leave me alone and stop asking me for release dates okay I didn't think you were gonna put that much effort into it I was thinking an absolute minimum effort because like you know it doesn't really matter how it looks I don't know if I want you to spend that much time on this feels kind of futile you know yeah we all know it happens like every few streams thank you for the fight if they are drawn switch like the star and getting both what the crayon is used for and making the mechanic not just a one-off and the mechanic won't just be a one-off because right here there is a bit pipe and you will not see this when you fly actually so what I was planning here is that there is like a map here and you can color the map and when you color the map a path appears so you basically color the blocks with another crayon I don't want programs into your game a level selector no hey who cares what if they do that none of the levels are going to work except for this one I don't jokes can play you are tricked by the gargoyle tag team areas historical you are a part of key's history now truly not wait for the input i've sung even about 1 million mr. beast okay so for the bridge we wanted a dynamic bridge that is only active for a few seconds you don't like 1 million mr. beast we can listen to okay i have i have three options for you guys so today i'm thinking of doing a long stream we could listen to 1 million mr. beast for the next four hours or we can listen to ks i think of it for the next four hours or we can listen to bernice for the next four hours the orang origami king ost has too much variety i'm not gonna get into the groove you know thank you lila i'm not listening to crazy bus that's just hurting me yes lena that was an awesome joke thank you very much fox was beyond blast music and a tool rain sounds eight hours rain sounds banger let me look at cardboard which is oh i can't really draw those out so easily i don't like the minecraft ost i know blasphemy they grow up so fast man feels like just yesterday when lila was like 17 years old and now she's having a kid sigma milling manga playlist push push push push we can listen to that for the next eight hours dominoes dominoes are toys and toys are adjacent to what we're doing and then we want crafts how mitosis these are all too well made we could have a piece of cardboard like this like a highway coming out of this but i don't really like that i could do a bunch of things but none of them are what i want right now another alternate is i can go to 1 million mitsumis and replace youtube in the world with a rainy mood for the best of both worlds okay let's check this out where's the rain oh it's pausing it because i already have youtube open in another tab it's fine it's fine i'm basically set into the no child life is both nice and makes me feel sad i mean you have siblings right so genetically speaking your sibling having a kid that's like basically 50% of you having a kid so it's almost the same thing if you're really involved in your sibling's child's life right it's not that bad but no that looks too noobish no it just means you should invest in your siblings child's lives and your nephew's lives see first time playing sonic narrations which i only played once for like 10 minutes i was excited versus like oh this is like a 3d sonic and i can go fast here and i can actually see where i'm going unlike in 2d sonic levels and then i noticed something they on purpose designed the levels in a way that the camera is going to turn in a way or like there's a wall blocking the view so that you cannot see the level in front of you a lot of the time so for some reason the designers of sonic think or seem to think that not being able to see the level in front of you makes it better it is a deliberate decision and that's crazy they were like man 2d sonic's biggest problem how can we recreate this in 3d and they went and did it might have just been a performance issue that is true actually yeah yes we are getting close to done fire phoenix to make you think fast to make you think fast we gave you 80 milliseconds of reaction time so that is physically impossible for a human to react to this hope you enjoy not really eco okay so what if it is just a cardboard bridge coming out of here would that look so terrible that's my grace i'm actually kind of team cartridge belt even though i don't really know exactly how a cartridge still don't make sense yet but i feel like um since the mario's y translation is part of the animation data it might apply mario's y translation somewhere and like from the animation so that a garbage value somehow affected that but also doesn't really make any sense or or maybe the music had a function called combinant somehow because it loaded garbage i don't know we will be on human reaction cuties um it depends on how this is programmed right like if you have an average of like 200 milliseconds before the cutie ears you can just kind of guess and get like four or five going pretty easily Yeah, I know Leela, it doesn't really make sense. On average, how long is this? There's about four times as much content, I would say, and the playtime is probably going to be like 80% longer? Twice as long? Maybe? I don't know. So, if this was cardboard, and it just came out of here like so, and then slowly went back in, I think that kind of works. I think that would be a good way to make this work. Imagine like this, you press the switch, the bridge comes out, and then it slowly goes back. You can even have this one like that, 20 potenets, 125, to make this next jump easier. Unrollable bridge, unrollable bridge, hmm. And then when it rolls up on it, it just shoots you back? But you don't even see the unrolling. That's the problem. The switch is down here, so if it unrolled, you wouldn't even see that. We could spend hours programming that cool effect, but like, no one would get to see it. I have such a machine, I'm putting a lot of effort into making sure the movement is fun. Spend five hours doing a cool thing that no one's gonna see?  Oh yeah, also, maybe this is interesting, but I've decided that if I'm gonna make my own game, we are probably using Godot. I talked to Godot left today to ask about how it compares to Unreal Engine 5, and he made a pretty good point, or a few pretty good points. I think it's gonna be a lot more viable for development than Unreal Engine, because Unreal Engine is so goddamn slow. The walk engine, yep, the walk engine. What is undot? Is that a non-walk branch? Is there a way to use Godot without being walk? That would be awesome. The recent drama wasn't even that big. It's just that all the users are mentally ill and in a really small bubble that doesn't actually matter. I'm gonna make undot and I'll blow up your balls if you are a man. Oh, this is a certified Mila Vincent joke. He's gonna be able to walk, but the compiler just flits him with trigger warnings. I'm gonna get trigger warnings. I remember in 2017 when getting triggered was fun. I think this will work. It's crazy how adding one pine tree suddenly makes the whole scene look like winter. Things don't talk poorly once you abide it. I don't know if I even said that. A matchbox. I think a matchbox is too small, right? This is actually massive. You can't tell the size so easily, but this is massive. You can make it as big as you want. Wait, why? Maybe I'm misunderstanding what a matchbox is. Nope, I thought it was this. It's a fictional world. I think I'm using the inside of the matchbox here. I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this. Now I know what you mean. I know what you mean. I think it is a cool idea. So the matchbox would be on top of here? Or... How are we envisioning this? It could be a really big matchbox on top of here that retracts like that. But then it doesn't retract from both sides anymore. I like the matchbox idea though. That's already good. The matchbox on each side on top of the thing. Yeah, I think that's a good decision. In that case, I'm going to buy this piece here. Oh, it's Mario. We don't care about fire hazard. He's already shooting fireballs. And he can all. I'm going to sell a bunch of metal pushing on it. Sorry, it's fire. All right, so a matchbox on each side. Like this. Now I just need to make a matchbox. Let's see if there's one on model resource where we can take good pictures from. We need a good brand though. Like if it's a Mario matchbox brand, we need a good name. It just matches. A little bit boring, don't you think? Phew. Cool. Candles. This is an awesome screenshot. You guys want to know what this is? 8033D488. That's actually the beginning of the object loop. Then we start us on stack. And then this is some special behaviors, I guess. We also start out on stack. And then we check if the behavior of the object matches the behavior in the list. And if not, then we just keep going in the list. And if it all matches, then we check if 8029E2F8. I think that's the object overlap check. Yes, because A0 is the object and A1 is the other object. And then, no, that's scanning the distance. And if it's less than the distance stored in this area here, we kill the thing. Honestly, pretty self-explanatory. I don't know what the YouTube comment is complaining about. It's just being a baby. Skillish, if you can read that. Cooper fire sticks. But why Cooper? Cooper doesn't shoot fire. Burner plants do. Fly guys do. Bowser does. Fire spewers do. You know, that's how I like to think about these things. I think I'm only from making this. Trying to figure out what's wrong here. I mean, of course, the colors don't make any sense. I don't understand why he's in the shell. But like, the fist is closed. Okay, that's a bit silly too. I don't see the entire issue, I think. I think I'm missing something. All right, now we have a matchstick that just comes up like this. Which has a part that makes Mario shoot fire. You think that's what the thought was? You think they just forgot about the fire flower? Did Twitch block your message? I wonder if there's one with the text shut down on it, please. What are you doing? Extra long, extra strong. That's what your mom said. I don't know. I don't know.  Failed to sense. Yeah if you can think of a funny pun for the fire flower. Honestly this texture is exactly what I want. I need to log in? I don't have an account. Most of the models in Free3D are not free, this is a scam. I will create an account in a second. It's free3dsmaxfile, are you fucking kidding me? Matos MacMatches, true that would be perfect. Lila, I need the textures. Something like on the stylus is what I want. This pattern here. How do I get this? This is not what I want. Is it this one? Why does it open a different page, what is going on? There's no download button. Let me check why it's usually this easy. But it won't look this good. Look at it man, this is nice. Surely one of these is going to have the textures in there. No download button. This one has a download button, but it's this strip. Oh, download button, but it's the wrong strip. No download button, download button, download button, but it's, you know what, this strip will work. But why not just try to get the texture? Like, I didn't think this was going to take that long. And it did not. So that's the issue. That's a weird texture actually. What we could do is multi-texture this, with one texture being the alpha for this effect, and one for the voxels, and the other being the actual voxels. I think that could work well, I like Koopa Stix, but Koopa Stix, what even is that a pun on? I don't really understand. That works because it's like Koopa Pastel, but Koopa Stix, I don't see it. I don't see it. I don't see it. Yeah, I think it's a weird multi-texture. Magma Mountain matches. What's Magma Mountain? I have an idea for this texture. This is going to go hard. So I'm going to blur this, and then I'm going to blur the other one. And then we have this one here for the color, and this one here for the pattern. I have a problem with scaling this down, and that is that the edges are going to look weird. So let me do the alpha layer separately. Yeah that's what I was worried about. That's what I was worried about. That looks a little weird, but it's going to be great for our shader here. Oh yeah, true. That would actually, I can kind of see that one working. So we're going to have this texture here besides the color. The color is going to decide the color, no the alpha is going to decide the color. It's going to go between prim, and let's just put this to shade for now. And then this one, texture one color, it's going to decide how much of the texture one pattern shows up. I actually need to invert the cycles. Texture zero color, combine color alpha, combine color alpha. Texture one color, texture one color. Needs to be a one. And then combine color primitive primitive. We don't have shade anywhere, that's going to be a problem. But let me experiment with this for a second. This needs to be a pattern texture. I'm going to pick any pattern texture for now. We just need like patterns, so we know it works at all. And then we can make the hexagonal pattern. Let's just use. Didn't we have a nice checkerboard pattern somewhere?  This one will work. Oof. Reset the texture type of this. Okay, that doesn't work at all. And that is something.  Why is the pattern not showing up? Is this inverted of what it should be? No, that doesn't make sense. Hello, jar. There is the pattern. That's kind of knowing what it's supposed to. Yuck. Okay. Okay. I think this combine idea is futile. This does not work at all. Imagine being in hell. It's so dumb again. It is funny though. So if this doesn't work, what else can we try? Could the issue be Let me just use a rough texture. Like, fuck it. We say goodbye to the and we just go with this. Might be more fitting for an N64 game here. That's the only thing that's gonna work. Let's move 32 by 64. I mean on one hand you're right, on the other hand look at what we could have. This looks so Minecraft.  I think this works. This is fine. That's not supposed to be mirrored at all. Actually, I kinda like that being mirrored. But yeah, this is what we do now. Let's offset the pattern. R.I.S.P. Roof. Since I'm planning to do a long stream today, I'm gonna have to do half my workout stream again. We're gonna have to do triceps extensions again with the trombo presses. And then the inside is like dirty cardboard, kinda, almost. Well, it's good that you're enjoying it. To do triceps? You don't have to, but I'm gonna. It's actually good evidence that being physically fit helps you mentally. I actually think it's basically proven at this point. Looks like I'm gonna have an exposed star. Nope. Doesn't really feel like a matchbox to me. Not sure how to describe the feeling. Let's try it because this feels like the outside is thick and really it's just the inside that is thick usually. What if I make this skinnier? Feels a little more like it. Make it look matchy and boxy, all right. I'll just make sure that the dimensions fit then. Yay! White princess. Where did that even come from? Oh, everyone will be buffed, that's where I'm gonna go, okay, I see now. You know what, that's a fair question. I thought the guy just randomly asked Lina out of the blue why she's trans. I remember when people were posting the meme that every romance is either gonna get ripped or become trans and then one person said that they will become ripped and now they're trans. Hello Scarf Cat, I'm glad you like it. Okay, ranting on this, Poopa Stix, eh, eh, Marius and C4, fire. We could make a Lethal Lava Land pun. Yeah, Stick Cinnamon. Piece of wood, twig, pain pool, mean pool, post steak. Lethal Lava Steak sounds like not good. No one chooses to go for the mussels, it's much safer to go for the Astrogen, this is true. See there, Rom Hacker, sometimes, most of the time, eh. There is fairies in the Rom Hacker community as well. Fairies are a powerful third faction, although their overlap with the trans faction is pretty big. Those two factions are partnering. Lethal Brunt Twix. Fire Spritter. No. Super Mario 64 fans discover Smoke Effect in this glitch. They think we're fans, we hate this game. Is there maybe a pun with Fire Flower in here? Fire Flower, Fire Flower, Fire Flower, Fire Flower. Flag. How is flag something for stick? Oh, it's not. Rod, there's also Rod. No, we're making a box of matches. What are normal match brands like? Matchbox brands. Oh, not this one. No. No. I've been feeling guilty all day recently. The divorce. Are your parents getting a divorce? Or your parent and your step-parent? Bowser Batons.  Kaze is saying I don't count because he wants Cottonians. I'm not saying that. Hate the game, then why SP3? I just can't stop myself from SP3. I kind of like Bowser Batons. The perfect match. King's Highway, Sushi Roku. Bigger on the banks. You want a one-run check message? No. The Meese Knees, luxury matches. What makes them luxury? Do they work better? Safety matches. I think Bowser Batons is actually the best one so far. What does ChatGPT say? Give me an easy win. For a Mario in universe brand. Lots of matches. It should be well-organized. Let me premium fire. If you hate the game, then why spend hours analyzing the game back to front? So I can hate it more accurately. Blazing Blaze matches in front. Okay, these are all garbage. As expected. It's Nope, I never bothered getting a driver's license in Canada because I don't drive. Bowser Blaze Batons. It's just Bowser Batons with a Blaze in the middle. Okay, you know what I remember what I said in the last stream? You need to think more schizophrenically. You shoot a fire enemy that makes sense. But like, fuck it. Throw in something in that doesn't make sense. Wario's War Sticks. I don't know. Penguin Poles. Nope, also doesn't make any sense. I can't just be schizophrenic on command. Weak, less stiff ones. Bob-omb Batons, since bombs are related to fires. Fire away matches. How are there so many match brands? Surely there can't be that much difference between different brands of matches. They're all the same, right? I don't know, man. Super Mario Strikers. I kind of like that. Because the Strikers are charged. Cool, you know. That's epic. Cheap cheaps and matchsticks with a big chunk of cheap diamonds. I just can't use them. Okay, I like the idea of a Mario enemy without any arms. Saying can't use them. But it's too much text, I think, for the lowest text. I don't know anymore. I definitely don't want Mario matches. God, why is this so difficult? Maybe one of these 3D models is like an interesting name on it. Safety matches, safety matches. True American. Two Mushroom Kingdom. Lethal Logs. Oh. Game & Match. Oh, these are good. They're both really good. Game & Match is so good, though. And Lethal Lava Logs is too. Ah, shit. Now we have two of them. What if we do both? We went from zero good ones to two good ones and two messages. Lethal Lava Logs. Well, because you're gonna burn the whole house down. I think they're both great and we should just use both. If you have two great ideas, why not use both? Really? Okay, I know I can't draw textures, which is why I'm going to make a temporary texture with the name of it on it. That's going to be all I'm gonna do for now. I might ask Zeyna to make a good version of it. What the fudge? Why is this text so goddamn big? Who made this text so big? I know exactly what you're referencing, folks. I've seen this before. I know I'm familiar with it. Me when I wanna watch the blue, but my bitch-ass wife wants to watch red. I love these terrible relationship videos that like 50 old moms post on Facebook and Instagram. You know what? That's good enough from what I do. Surely this conveys the idea and Zeyna can make a decent one. Seems a rip, probably. Like I said, this will just be the temporary texture that I'm making and then hopefully Zeyna will make a decent one that is better than what I'm making here. So leave the lava locks and the other was game and match. This should probably be on one line here. Just because it feels like it's like a thing that goes on one line. Yeah. Why is that so hard to read? Hmm. This could help. You know what? That's readable. Game space and match. This will work for now. Like I said, temporary texture. I've seen a YouTube shot of that guy that says he makes games, but then every time you watch a stream, he's just talking to chat or reacting to a video. And he said you should never build an asset that is a placeholder that looks like it could be final. And I think that's like a really stupid thing to say. You know, when in-game bridge has so much story behind it, I was scared. Hello, gray space adventure. I was thinking of playing UFO 50, guys. I saw where I was recommended to play it. And then I saw the Northern Lion video playing house party and house party looked amazing. And I want to play house party. You guys think it's worth it? Would you recommend this game? Game and match. Yeah, he'll make the modern gasoline. Is it the exact opposite? Well, it is a stupid thing to say. They are closed and then you press a button and then they open up. That's the idea behind this. You're gonna put in debug assets to convey the ideas to the rest of the team sometimes. Or to verify that everything works as intended. Otherwise, how are you going to know when something breaks? The crazy thing about this is that this does not need. But this can have vertex colors. So that's very, very helpful here. Let me see what color this usually is. Oh, it's almost white all the time. The hell? What was I thinking? It should be filled with matches. I'm thinking of putting a match texture in here. I don't think I can realistically make 3D models of matches. That would be a little high poly. Let's see. What's the best way to make a match texture? So we could do something with a little bit of depth where we have a row of matches and then we have another row of matches for the alpha layer on top. That's probably the best way to make this work. I'm getting the vibe that I'm not going to find anything here. Is this the closest to what we need? There's only like five matches, too interesting. This looks too orderly, too, but that might be the only way to make the technique I had in mind work. Let me try this. Is this too low resolution for N64? It might actually be easier to pre-render these somehow. You will pre-render them? OK, well, if you pre-render them, then I guess what I'm doing here is fine for now. What a disaster. Oh, God. All right, well, I guess I can be lazy. I like to read. True, Biomech, true, true, true. I'm so glad we don't have a payment deadline. Then we'll go off my estate. How did I name this? I'm thinking we can just do that to get a little bit of extra resolution out of this. Awesome. This is not wide enough, I think. Somehow that feels wider, even though it's darker. That's crazy. So the idea is that this will open like this. And then once the time is up, it's going to just slowly start going back and then speed up and go back in. That's the idea. Oh. I have a program that just like that before. I know we have an arrow gate somewhere. Do we have any other? Door switch?  No. Hmm. Can we use this anyway? Lethal Avalanche. Oh, yeah, right. We do use them. Yeah. You know what? This behavior works, I think. Okay. Let me make sure it works.  So the cool thing about Godot over Unreal Engine is that iteration is a lot faster. Performance for low-end games seems to be a lot better because it's not as bloated and it doesn't scale as good, which is irrelevant for like a low-end GameCube graphic game. And apparently, you can easily port it to all different kinds of consoles, which would be amazing. I wonder if this is what caused the crash just now. Oh. Yep, that would have caused the crash. Because the script is interpreted, so you don't even need to compile the thing. But I mean, okay, interpreted script, of course, it's slower, but like good modern hardware. If you don't manage to make your CPU finish in like a thousandth of the time that your CPU has, it's kind of a skill issue. So I don't really care. I want some sound. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, how long does it go? That's going for way too long. Is it not? Okay. Okay, we have to shorten that. Okay. The game can run at a variable frame rate. So on console, you have an option to make it run as fast as it can. And then it's going to run between 30 and 60 FPS most of the time. It's rare you go under 30 or at 60. But I mean, it's possible. It's just very rare to run 60. Now, all the small areas actually run. Actually, it's not that rare. There is, of course, one like half the areas run at 60. And none of them run below 30. Actually, there's one specific view spot if you're in the highest graphics settings possible that runs at 29 FPS. But are you going to crucify me for that? I don't think so. Let's multiply the view frame here by two. And then put this at 150 maybe. See if that's a good number. Okay. So there's an issue with position caching going on there. Okay, yeah, that's easily enough. I like it. God, this is such a cool mission. This is what video games should be like. Oh, and that's a bug for sure. All right. I'll be taking five minutes and then I'll be starting my workout. And I'm going to try to stream longer today. Maybe you guys can give me five minutes real quick. I'll be right back. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Hello? Right, I have to start doing my workout. We're going to do bicep extensions today. The light version. If you have any questions, if you would have a question.    I'm going to warm up real quick. It's too bad you guys can't really see it. It'd be more fun if you could. Actually, you can kind of see the game here. And we'll switch to the full body, see what this is going on. But whenever I touch my OBS, it just crashes. Star noise and rain sound stream. I'm so sorry we talked over that. Could you see anything at all? Kind of. All right. So... All right. Nice, we have the good defaults now. And this obviously needs a separate condition data. Condition data doesn't need this part here. Or these two here. All right. All right. No rotation here. That's important to me, actually. And then... Let's just go in the middle here. With this B paraboom set. And next workout. Another warm-up.  We're switching to 75. This is literally just a stream of me living my life at this point. I guess I'm just having a side trip with working out and cooking a lot. It limits my stream time, unless I just live my life on stream. Can't wait until someone makes a legit third game. That would be pretty cool, but the amount of work put into that, I imagine, is a lot. I think that's going to be a while. This is a focus on work stream. But I have natural obligations I need to go after, such as working out. Such is the reality of having this fleshy body. Would you, if you were the boss of someone, be like, why are you going to the toilet? But I thought this was a workplace. That's what you're doing to me right now. Would you tell poor people why you're brushing your teeth? You're supposed to make money, isn't it, poor? That's what you're doing to me. That's what you're doing to me. That's what you're doing to me. That's what you're doing to me. Switch pressed, switch taking. That's what you're doing to me. Actually, don't need the third action. This is actually baby easy to do. Next, we just need to decide how far they move, which will be the distance between here and here divided by two. 1835 by two is 917.5. So 917 is what we want to move. Um. And then a move speed of like 10.5 maybe. And I think I want the move speed to increase as the thing increases. So. Um. Min time. That's what I'm thinking. Um. And then we should have working matchboxes already. Yeah. No way it was that fast program.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't want to easy. The following. Let me check my workout notes here. Yeah, 105 is the way they want. Where's the. Where's the matchbox. Did I not export this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah, we still need a design for the snowball launcher. It could just be like a cardboard rack, but. It kind of seems like a lame idea. So I don't think I want that. Okay. I don't have sound on. Is it not going back. Hello, Mr. Game and watch fan. Okay, this first part looks immaculate, but the way it goes back does not look good at all. Also, should I rotate these? I think so. Why do they not go back? We can also increase the speed here a little bit. Actually, I like the low speeds. I should ramp it up even slower, so you can see it go out. Why would I include the calculator for select? Where are you getting these crazy ideas? Oh. Wait, what? It's just taking forever. Hey. How did this ever work? Oh, wait, that's sensitive one there. Okay, this is good. We know this is not good. Okay. Yeah, just now we had a bug where if you press the match, then one of the doors in all alone Okay, whenever I run this game and watch, I will put this to the test. There's also something about the shy guys I still want to change. They just die at a certain height right now. Which is not how I envisioned them to behave. Can be a little faster. Let's look at the symbol guy. So right now they die if they're below this, but instead what we should store is the last height of the service that they were on. And then if they're 400 coordinates below that they die. Minus one is a random number. But it will work here. Do you already use this here anywhere? We don't use C and X, but not Y. Cool. This should do it. Now all the symbol guys should act correctly. Well, rude. This crayon also does not have the correct drawing distance. Doesn't have a drawing distance at all. 177. Good enough. Shadow size 250. I think that's good. Shadow circle. That's good. Let's take a look real quick. Disappeared, yeah, because it's upscaling. Shadow's way too big. Shadow's still too big. I could have just measured it out, but I thought that just doing that was good enough. Actually, I can really just measure it out. I guess, yeah, we have to see how the vibe is. So I'm gonna do this whole thing legit once. Um, what happened? What happened to my bridge? Is it just instantly not working anymore? Is this what we want? What the hell? How are they not moving at all anymore? Is this condition just instantly given? It has to be that. Nope, they just don't move at all anymore. What the fuck? It's not getting this to cost this, right? Yeah, I had the same idea much time. If it's that, then that's crazy though. Yeah, it's not. Okay, there's no way that setting the velocity did that. Right? I wrote an equal sign instead of a minus. It was a typing error. This is definitely a bug I need to fix. As soon as you start sliding, you just lose your hold object. Which at first, I think this is true. The rain sound told everyone to bet. It's beautiful. Now to the snowball launch that's going to be here. We want snowballs coming out of here that follow Mario. First question is what is the snowball made out of? I'm thinking we're going to try cotton again. Cotton is going to be really hard to make work. We can probably just make a fully white ball with a few fuzzy bits sticking out. Yes, you can throw the crayon if you want, but that's a lot more difficult. Something like this. Cotton snowball. When do we make it come out of? Yeah, I think so too. We can try to make one real quick to show what I had in mind. I was thinking almost fully white and then we just pick random bits like so. Yeah, that was too far.  And these random bits will have transparency on them. With a bit of a texture. You like Koopa style? That's good. There you go. Holy shit, it's a Reina appearance and a baby appearance. Reina, I'm Zane. And you're the baby. Yes, I'm the baby. I am the baby. I don't think they can see her like that. Hang on. Hello baby. Hello Reina. Hello. Look guys, it's my baby. It's the baby. Hello. Isn't she cute? She's the cutest little bean on the planet. She can't say hello to everyone yet, she's too young. No. Hello. One of these days. One of these days, little Reina, you get to meet the chat. Yeah? She looks very confused. So that's why I was your baby? Well, I guess this is also my baby. He's got three babies now. That's his wife, his daughter and the game. Can she code yet? We're trying. You're trying? All she does so far is say Goo Goo Gaga. And spit everywhere. I tried to put her down for a nap and then she just cried. And then she stopped. Put her down? Make her sleep with the fishes? She just needed to go down for a nap. But she doesn't want a nap. She wants to see what's going on. She's got places to see. Things to do. This baby, yep. Yep. Boom. She can do King Dedede's up. She goes, yep. Boom. All right. I'll take her back upstairs. Good baby. Bye, bye. She can only do Python and Rust. She's old enough for seeing a zombie. This is true. Hopefully she learns it soon. She doesn't have to become woke. Oh, and I just got cake. Isn't that awesome? I think this works really well. Birthday cake, yep. That's birthday cake. Baby made the cake. She can't do cake yet. Maybe soon. Yep. What's going on here? Why is the lighting so different? I don't understand this part. Hey. Of course, I know that. When I say I'm German, I mean I'm like his child. Okay, but seriously, why is the color different? Doesn't make any sense, does it? That makes even less sense now. Am I going insane? Okay. I'm going to export this in-game and look at this in-game. This doesn't make any sense. Wait, that's the wrong object. This is what I need. Extra free. Static objects. Zero. 500 coordinates in the air. Can I have a dark chocolate? Allergic to caffeine? That's crazy. Hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. No, it generally does look darker. Do you see that? Why does it look darker? Maybe I have to reset vectors. Ah. Hello, Hoshi, welcome to gaming, working out and eating cake. It's been a long time without you. Yes, I would never eat cake that is not chocolate cake. I'm very picky with cake. Because if you're only eating shit, you might as well refuse to eat shit that you don't like. You know what I mean? Okay. Okay. Okay.  You can enjoy life a little. May I request a song? No. Dude. Okay, guys. You have to trust me. This song gets good three hours in. All right. It's just a little longer. Then it gets good. It's like one piece. Like the first 500 episodes, they're just all right. But after 500 episodes, it gets good. One piece was always good. I knew someone would say that. You got baited. Get engagement formed. Sorry. I have actually read almost the entire one piece manga. In like chapter 1120 or something you know what i would say one piece get one piece the first 1004 1041 chapters are good chapter 1022 and i'll go with it you should start videos like that wow that's a genius idea i'll be like guys i know this video is three hours long but it gets good two hours in just like one piece white chocolate is still good clayman you're not losing out on too much looking forward to the analog 3d review yo thank you for let me watch my stream back for like five seconds so i know what happened so i know what to thank you for and who to thank johan 75 oh my god oh thank you for 75 i'm definitely gonna do a very honest review of the analog 3d um i have this crazy theory i asked them to send me an early copy and they didn't respond and i had the top tweet on their tweet i'm thinking the only reason they would not send me a review copy is because something's wrong with it right like otherwise that would be like an insane business move so i'm i'm thinking something's wrong here i'm thinking it's not quite kosher but we'll see i don't want to draw a conclusion before i have the thing in my hand i can't even run roms on this shit well surely that's just a legal protection thing you say right surely i can just get my everdrive out and play my roms on that like if it accurate to n64 then surely it will also run everdrives because like how else are you gonna even make the thing work at all so i didn't provide any gameplay video of the analog really quite interesting what the final product is gonna look like well for me it's um let me get let me get this quote here i'm finding it sweet right now in a world obsessed with progress yet haunted by impermanence analog 3d feels like an anomaly and the relentless march of progress is something essential is often lost the analog 3d we sought to reclaim the soul of the n64 it is more than technical the creation of the analog 3d is an act of defiance against the ephemeral nature of technology it's a solemn dignity when you say shit like that like what the fuck so something ain't right there so dude if i make a review and it comes turns out that the thing is garbage i'm just gonna put like two minutes of quotes like that in the video it would be so funny so you know about 150 100 yeah the video video conclusion needs to be written like that oh that would be funny i'm definitely strong considering it super mr rabbit 64 hello oh that's what you mean oh my god that would be straight up evil okay um seeing this cotton ball in game i don't like it doesn't look good at all nope not at all it looks terrible and something about the lighting just looks very off too the summer cat is so good i'm telling people if you just want to play n64 games get a cheap knockoff everdrive if you want to develop n64 games get the summer card the summer card is multiple times better than the everdrive like in absolutely every regard oh i'm gonna do another slope real quick and then think more about how i can make this look decent you like the everdrive x7 i hate the x7 because the x7 doesn't work uab for me or it works once per pc boot and then the one time that it does work it takes like three minutes to upload my raw i hate it dude yeah the summer card is better get that one so so good hello riono welcome to the stream where i just live my life yeah so we can't have miss i wonder if that's a back face culling thing yes no it's not cool um uh so it's so so so what's this here um we have a craft level here the visuals are a little bit deceiving i should just show you in game so this is the level and we want there to be snowballs here this is supposed to be kind of like a craft snowball area or craft snow area will be a snowball launcher here and it will show snowballs down and we're gonna make a decent looking snowball here somehow sounds pretty good clayman i actually kind of like white chocolate more than dark chocolate and then you do all that to bring the crayon back and with the crayon you can draw the star to get a star so i'm having issues making a snowball because the snowball has to be made out of craft materials so i'm thinking the snowball should be made out of wool but making wool on the n64 look good difficult so i'm thinking maybe wool is not the play right i tried some fizzy bits on bobs here but it just looks kind of bad and then there's also the lighting issue for some reason i'm guessing that's because the normals are not actually continuous so yarn paper paper could work really well yeah how does a paper ball look like so this is really high quality though if you think about it this will need so many polygons i'm gonna do that so no idea what you're trying to do with the ball fair enough it might have been a bad idea um yes i actually was thinking about snow i think it should just be paper squares that snow i just still need to think of a thing that they come out of but paper snow is probably the idea i don't know what froth it up means this looks kind of nice if i mean this looks doable if that's possible when it's also a day on screen at a time two at most but it's a whole library or no it can't just be like oh the snowball is only 3 000 polygons that's not gonna like of course less polygons is always better and a sail so what if we make it look like a paper ball like that by just having random pieces like i don't think that's terrible  and it looks like realistically crumpled paper now so so   huh what'd you say yay well these are my crevices next is just adding like a paper texture and having each one of these be a separate uv aisle so that there's a few harsh edges in here so and paper was a good idea so oh that's too much it's doable riona but that sounds like absolute torture so gonna love these um i don't think that one meant anything it's oh actually maybe that means something okay well it's just second game even worked nope it did not work cool cool cool cool why so i think it's too empty sector because it's not a new layer oh no i mean it would be cool but yeah oh yeah next question this is actually two questions in one where does the snowball come out of and where does the confetti here come out of i think the confetti we can just spawn out of nowhere i think it's fine if it just materializes in midair somewhere although it looks stupid from far away so i'm thinking maybe the confetti should only spawn while you're in the This area, that helps with it looking stupid and it helps with performance. Milk sounds like a good choice, Clayman, I agree. I always drink a glass of milk with my toast in the morning too. And cake and bread are basically the same thing, especially here in Canada. Every cake in Canada is just bread. It would be fun in Nintendo for Life, but hard to implement. Yeah, so I'm thinking Snow will just spawn in. And it will spawn in as soon as you're somewhere on the Styrofoam. Like just jumping on the Styrofoam turns it on and then as soon as you leave the area turns off. Of course it will be free download. I can't charge money for this, Nintendo would actually murder me. You know what I found out? I just found this out like a week ago. In 2019 I received a legit DMCA from a lawyer that Nintendo hired to like send a DMCA to me. And I responded to the email with just suck my cock, but in cock do I replaced with a zero so that wouldn't be filtered out. And nothing happened. This was five years ago, 2019. I don't know how I got away with that. I should be in prison right now. Did the lawyer actually do it though? The lawyer that sent the DMCA to Super Mario 64 Land. And they took down my The Missing Link video. They must think I'm completely mentally unstable, right? Like they basically were like we can take your entire life away and put you in prison. And I responded suck my cock. Like they have to think I'm mentally not quite there. We're still on the table. Oh my god. What does a snowball launcher look like?  Thinking about the Mario 64 snow wave generator looks kind of poopy. We can't just make them fall from above. We could have a trash bin on the side and the trash bin just spawns the paper. I think that would be very fitting. And a graphic riftler. Make a trash bin on the side. I think that makes sense that there would be crumpled up paper coming out of there. And then we could have the trash bin stand like this and then every now and then it tips over. Yeah, it can also just fall from the side, but the trash bin that just keeps falling over and then spawns a snowball whenever it falls over. Think about it, man. That's a cool idea. Just not sure though I want to put it on a string. So I know that it can just fall from the sky, but do we want it to just fall from the sky? I don't think so. The problem I have with the paper bin is I'm not sure how to place it unless I add another styrofoam platform. But then you can also just jump over here, which I don't like. Or I put it in the sky, but then it's like in the sky and that's weird. And also a paper trash bin doesn't actually fit the level theme very well. So maybe just having it fall from the sky is the way to go. I will just make it fall from the sky for now. How's that sound? I do need the innards. So wait, fall. Okay, wait again, all we need. Now that I think about it. I actually want them to be the exact same timing all the time. And I also want them to target Mario a little bit. So the idea was they would just fall down here and then because the falling was always the same, that would be like a constant time. But I wanted to go after Mario. So instead of that, I need some other way of measuring it. And I think I'm going to use the global timer for this. That should work. Our health is only a youth 16. We can't use that. Capacity is also 16. Okay. Now this works. They didn't respond at all. Actually, they just ignored that. They probably just thought this guy's mentally ill. Like, you don't fuck mentally ill people. That's like a bad idea because they are reckless. So okay. Is this all I need? Thinking about it right now. Well, I need to add the behavior to my behavior list for one. All right, a nice time to make them target Mario. 256 divided by 3 is 8 and 5 roughly. No, this one is not done. I'm just a basement dweller. So now let's see what happens. Oh. Cool. So this is something we need globally. Radius was 425. So this is 425. It works with offsets. Also all 425s.  So listening to rain sounds. I would have listened to One Million Mr. Beast the whole stream, but people were saying that's not it. I also offered Bernice the entire stream, but no one said anything about that one. It's compiling. We're back to One Million Mr. Beast. It's too late. We're already in the rain mood. Nothing's happening. Did I change the behavior? I didn't change the behavior, did I? Paper snowball. Paper snowball. Paper snowball. What the hell? Oh. I have a blimp. Cool. I didn't set the home pose back.  yeah, the rain was real fake rain. Okay, how is it not 425 though? What did I set it to? It should be 350, right? Okay. And the wall hitbox is clearly not what we want, but the rest looks pretty cool. I might want to randomize the rotation a little bit. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what's that? Ew. Why did they spawn almost next to each other? Nasty. I wonder if this works. See, there's an order to which the rotations are being applied to. And depending on whether it's just lost or not, this will work. It works. That's cool.  Oh, I know the issue. No, hopefully they are in a constant tempo. Come here. Here we go. That looks like a constant tempo to me. And that really does look like crumpled up paper. He just jumped down? I didn't know he could. I get the feeling they are a little bit too big. But actually their size is no problem. If instead of chasing Mario, we make it so they alternate left and right a little bit. Also, the shadow is square. Could a few straight triangles inside mesh poking out to make it look a bit more like from the paper. Eh. I think it's good this way. You're right though, that that could look good. These snowballs kind of feel like they would do free damage to the player, not just to Alright, this feels like a good amount of randomness, although I should decrease the wall radius even more. Maybe even like no wall detection. The wall detection just kind of looks like jitter. So does he want to run Gamecube games or no? What do you think? Take a guess. I mean, if you wanted to play Frog Golf on the N64, I'm sure you could optimize the game enough. If you guys have ever seen Frog Golf, it's actually an amazing game. It was a low polygonized Isle Delfino that I made into Mario 64. But even then, it's like clearly not running as well because it's not 60 FPS. Why am I not being hit? Wrong object list. Yep, wrong object list, that's why. Oop. Let me check how difficult it is to get past this. Seems easy enough, easy enough. Okay, yeah, that's fairly simple. And then on the way back it should be even easier, right? Because you can just run it down. Man, that coin is so smooth. Awesome, very nice. I think that finishes most of the Paper Luigi mission. Next, we need Paper Confetti, just to make this area look a little nicer. Let me think about the confetti effect for a second. It could be an environment effect. We could just reuse the leaf effect actually, or the rain effect. No, it would have to be the leaf effect. Remember the leaf effect from the course 7 or whatever? Then it would just be white triangles with vertex normals. Wait, that can't, we can't have vertex normals on it. Because if it's vertex normals, then also we need to compute the vertex normals. I don't know, so I'm working, I don't think about those things. A few. Thank you, YoshiLikes. Dude, there's something weird going on with Light in this egg right now. I saw it there too. Oh yeah, I also want to make a new exclamation box. The OG one is kind of poopy. Do you want to give it a try, if you're still here? The exclamation box. It just looks really bad right now. What the fuck? How did I do that? Yeah, that was the cabin hat and hat glitch. But how did I open the thing twice so fast? Doesn't make any sense. The wing cap sound also sounds super wrong to me. Do you know that disease that some people have, when they get sick? They look at people's faces and it just looks like demons? That's how I feel about this wing cap music. I can't tell what's wrong, but it is wrong. It is a vanilla bug, but I just opened the cap twice somehow. That's not a vanilla bug, I think. Unless I found another vanilla bug. The one on Discord with the NSX music to me, is that what you're basing yours on? I asked the guy if he minds me using his taggen or model, but he hasn't really sent it to me. So probably not what I'm basing mine off. But there is only one box. Unless I placed two boxes there and I didn't realize. Nope. Nope. The wing cap remake sounds more similar to the Yoshi's Island one. Oh yeah, there is a Yoshi's Island version of that song too. That is a fair point. Envmode leaves. This is what we want. I'm gonna do another quick set and then we look at this. Actually, I don't think we even need normals on this. Normals are unnecessary. I don't think we need normals on this. Yeah, so... What if we just do this without a texture? And make them smaller. This is also interesting. This effect is not optimized. We can definitely do this. I'm gonna move that left and that left. That's all. I just started deadlifting at some point and then I just kept deadlifting. And now I train with 417x5. Or 400x9. Yeah, we're just gonna make a new envmode. I wish I could somehow make this all into one function, but that's fine. Okay. Okay. What do we need the leaf count variable for? We don't need it. Heh. Okay. Oh, wait. I see. I see what this does. Pain.  We need it here. Okay.  We're trying to get this the same on MU and N64. Is it 3 hours in the rain yet? Yeah? Stream today's workout? I just streamed and I was just working and I have to do my workout. There are things you have to do in life to stay alive. And working out, I think, is one of them. So I don't really have a choice other than to work out on stream if I want to stream. I do go swimming sometimes, but I have not worn a speedo yet. Okay. Okay. Okay. Why don't make a level? Let's try. Why do make a level? Time travel. And select Gun Burst.  Height goes up to 96. So we need 12 of these. Default should never be on me to explain to you why. Like, why are you doing the thing? Huh? Here's something from me. You come convince me. Why do I have to convince you? Why do I have to convince you? Why do I have to convince you? This is bizarre. There should be 8 of these. That's a bug we didn't notice before. I think. I hope. I don't know why there's small rotations, but I guess we'll find out at some point. That's bizarre and I don't understand that. Okay, this is also just wrong. This can't be here. And this should lead to render issues in a few rare instances. No, it should be fixed. Right, and we don't want the leaf material, we want our own material here. Our own material that's digitally just white. But it's fine for now to do this with leaves to make sure it works at all. Okay, and if we did everything right, a bunch of leaves should show up now. In total it should be 96 leaves. How many leaves was that, did you count? Wait, I messed up. It wasn't supposed to be like this. The print color was good actually. I didn't mess up here. I messed up this time. Hello, mixed stone. I don't think this will fix the crash, but let's see what happens. It did fix the crash. Alright, count the leaves quick. Is it 96? Oh my god, the leaves look so good. This is beautiful. This is for the autumn level by the way, or was this effect. Some of these leaves are black though. Not that it will matter, but colors, this is why. Ah, yes, okay. I'm just going to leave a note for myself here. And then we're going to remove this material here. Wait, that was the wrong one. Okay. Okay. Okay. No, I'm not. I'm not Biobak, I'm not. The ball is long gone. I just had a cool idea for the paper ball. We're on the snow now. I just had the idea to use the material for the snow as well. Yeah, I was saying earlier, we need a new animation model and I asked if you want to do it. There was a guy in my showcase channel that showcased this really cool one, which was like a 2000 polygon box. He said he was going to provide the pre-rendered texture, so I was just going to use that. Okay, I don't like the material. We need to make a snow material now, or a paper snow material. We have some pretty tight performance restrictions on this one. So what we can do here is very limited. The cost is per vertex map texture. Also. And map doesn't work because there is no vertex colors on this or no vertex novels on this. If you die, you are booted out. Done so.  I think. All right. So we can't have lighting or shading, but we don't want callback. So really all that leaves us is maybe a prim color. But probably not. No shade color, literally just texture. We can have one texture that's like shifted at least. Or we could literally just have it be white. Literally just this is the material. I think that works. Honestly, yeah. Okay.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  I don't know why alpha data always turns itself on. It's like everywhere now. It's just like a fast 64 updating that alpha data is now on everything. Do you see this? What does it even do? This is true. The guy on the PC. What is this? This is so weird. I have not seen that one.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Getting decent snow now. This looks extremely fitting to me. What do you think? You like it? It's going to be over a small area. I don't know. I still don't see it. No, it's a paper crop level. We want them like this. Next, I got to define the spawn area for these. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.   Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's doable too. That wouldn't really be any more expensive. Actually, it would be cheaper. We could make this proper looking snowflakes. That would be cheaper. Yeah, maybe that's not so bad. How would that look like? So, let's say... Generate, mirror, mirror. That's just the following piece of tree. And our paper snowflakes look like in kindergarten, right? Something like this. Okay. No, it's not. No, this is what it looks like, 8-way symmetry. If you have colds cut in them, you can do that too. Probably not like that. Yeah, this was a good idea, I think. I just need to pre-render this into a texture. Yeah. And by pre-render I mean do this. That blend across there is fine, we can just remove that in post. There we go. Nice. I think this deserves to be a 60. 32 by 32. That is big enough. 32 by 32. Surely we don't need it any bigger than that. Does it automatically attach this as layer 4? I believe it does. Yeah. Just so this is not confusing us in the future, I'm just going to fix this real quick. What the hell is going on? I don't get it. Oh well. Doesn't quite look like I thought it would. You put it at 60 by 60? No. The texture dimensions doesn't really matter. Ain't that your fix, yeah? I'm actually going to make this a 64 by 64, I've changed my mind. Just because it kind of looks bad here for some reason. There we go. There we go. I think that's just a Blender render preview issue. We're not actually in-game like that. I'm a bit worried that now it will look like there's warping going on, but we'll see. We'll see. There we go. Yeah, definitely looks like the snowflakes that we just made. You're free to ask questions as long as it's not like really stupid questions. I get very annoyed with stupid questions sometimes. I'm just very passionate. So something like this as the spawn area seems good to me. Oh, we could just legitimately have them be in a square. It's a gym routine. Push, pull, likes. I don't do anything special. Wait, someone... Yeah, this might be important. This is actually garbage. We don't know the name yet. One suggestion that I liked a lot though was Handmade Heights. Due to still colors, it wouldn't be that expensive. In fact, it would probably only cost a few microseconds, not even like a millisecond. Just because I know how to program. That's the truth. Watch me, I know how to program. So I can make all my crazy ideas come true. And I have no excuse not to make them. Spawn height is set to 6800 here. Let me check how high that is. That is very high. The hell? What was I thinking here? Oh, I see. So it can spawn that far down as well. Interesting. Interesting, interesting. Cool, cool, cool. So if you want to make it, you can make the layers of snowflake build up when they hit objects. Yes, but then rendering them being built up would be very expensive. But also I thought by colliders you meant things to collide with Mario. Which, you know, that would be cheap. But having them collide with collision would be a lot more expensive. So the range is 18648. Oh my god, that's giant. Measure this range. 7870. 71 actually. Yes, I can, Nathan, but I won't. Wouldn't it be easier to have them bounce off Mario than build surfaces here? That would be cheaper. Yeah, of course, rendering an infinite amount of geometry is always going to be infinitely expensive. Just fixing some compiler warnings. Oh my god, this is so good looking. Oh, that's beautiful. They don't go far enough down, though. And they start too high up. I gotta upload more case clips, I've been so productive, I'm like backed up like 10 clips or so. I think I'll just start uploading like 3 times a week and sub twice a week. For a bit. Are you fond of the snowballs? They are. There are creases in here, but the creases are on purpose. Also interesting. Do you see that? That's the bug with the lighting. Hello Caddx, thank you, thank you. Yeah, I gotta be crumpled up. No, I want them to go further downwards. Oh no, so it should be like 4000, minus 4000, that's how far down I think they should go. And then, actually 4000 is too much. 3000. It might not look like a crumpled piece of paper yet to you, but as soon as Biomech has had it, I'm sure it will look like exactly that. So I'm not sure yet whether we have to turn this off when Mario is far away or not. Because this might be a really cheap effect, and it looks so good too. I don't like where the snowball spawns though. The snowball spawning there looks really bad. No, we need to do something about the snowball. We can't have this. It needs to come out of something. It looks terrible. What would be next on our to-do list? I'm gonna write a minus here. Next is inside the cardboard, red coins inside the pyramid area, or the 8-bit pipe to Mario Paint. Oh my god, we're already in the last three areas here. Right, and I need to do the Yoshi coins. Can't forget about those. Yeah, that would be the idea motion. It's a lot of snowflakes. I mean, the snowflakes is 96 of them, so that's 182 triangles. 182 triangles is about as much as Mario's left arm. Or maybe both arms combined. Right, so rendering all of these snowballs combined is as much as like two of Mario's arms. Realistically. But we'll see. I don't think they're very expensive. Either way, I think we'll continue this another day. I'll think about what I upload for clips. And I will see you guys next stream. There will definitely be a stream on Saturday. Maybe there will be a stream earlier, I don't know. Bye bye.
