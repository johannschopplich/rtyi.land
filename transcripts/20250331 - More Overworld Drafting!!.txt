Hello lynx hello hello hello selton oh what happened here go to sleep no hello beta beta sigma omega we are back to working on the overworld draft this is gonna be the part with the happy the super happy tree and um over there is where i'm gonna enter the wing cap level and this goes to the previous overworld hopefully it does hey oh yeah i made tons of changes to this since last stream it's now got the dojo for some reason i'm not sure what to do with the dojo i just put the dojo here because the overworld was so empty i'm not sure if the dojo is going to be enterable i'm also thinking i'm gonna make it so that if you skip on these four rocks here oh my god that's a bad collision bug if you skip on these four rocks you'll get a blue coin for it got the forge while the iron is hot what does this mean what's the time for you 2 p.m 14 o'clock bro is forging i have such a long video planned for next saturday i think this might hit a million views or it might just hit 300 000 and then i will be sad because it was very expensive to pay for the editing at this point i have to finance my video editing with sponsor deals it is what it is oh well what's up guys so okay i don't like how this works um originally the idea was that you would need the cloudcap to get up here which i suppose you might have unlocked it at that point already and i mean whether you have unlocked it at this point already or not is kind of irrelevant although it would be kind of cool if this was not unlocked at that point but i have an issue with that and that is that having the cloudcap in the overworld is going to be awkward because what if you just go to a previous part and then you know break the world geometry and look over the walls and see nothing so i don't like that i think there should be an alternate way to get there instead of yoshi and there's plenty of yoshi statues here there's two karate yoshis right here hello noah seagull seagull seagull any ost wishes for today i'm glad you liked it although to be fair i had not that much input on this compact um i kind of only did like a couple ideas and the voice acting battle for beginning bottom ost all right let's do it you get one big statue for every star so in the end you have an overworld with 180 statues you think that would be a good idea um the release of rtyi i'll probably make like a video essay about it okay tell me if i'm delusional here because some people have told me that this is a crazy take to have but i think our compact had the funniest jokes in fact i think most compacts were very unfunny but at the same time i also think that our compact was the most repetitive one that's like a perfectly reasonable opinion right i feel like that's the only reasonable take on this but author got very mad when i said that and i don't really care about it because uh i mean i had little input on the hack itself anyway but some other people on my team cared shadow compact just didn't belong in the competition at least he didn't do that oh yeah honestly the only compacts i liked from the competition were the ones that weren't chaos at all which is like yeah the thing is um they just weren't any good ideas it's all like old jokes that have already been told making a chaos hack is all about you know telling telling a joke that the audience will laugh at at the expense of the streamer and this just didn't happen it was all just the same jokes that we already knew i had hoped people would actually come up with something new you know like that balzar hack that at least like had a new idea although it wasn't really a joke but at least i can respect that they had the vision at all the old over music state um but do bus working with music a little bit trying to figure out what would work for the overworld so probably not but maybe in a shape in a way it's my chance to get reverb to it to be honest something else wasn't too bad about that the effects are very creative it provides unique experience i guess although there's like a degree to which you can make it less repetitive right ideally the way that the chaos effects would work would have it be combine them in unique new ways that cause new gameplay experiences right that's the idea of chaos that like i have no the combination of effects tells new jokes all the time yo thank you for the stop skyloft welcome i could barely read that message i'm sorry pretty well i hope there will be some rhythm-based obstacles in platforming games huh my wife fixes dsi's test out a function now i cannot hear you but you're welcome well i guess mario isn't usually that funny either i feel simple sees it more as a challenge interesting maybe chaos mario was only funny to me because i am the author so it feels like i am trolling him and i get my pleasure from that although i see a lot of people laughing at it so i don't know all right so there's two level entrances in this overworld here the first is there will be a flying ship here that you need some amount of stars to pilot you get on it cutscene happens and you fly into the sky the other one is the clouds the clouds have to be above koopa wave cove um i don't like that my notes say there is a cloud cap where there's a cloud over where koopa wave cove would be in the overworld using the cloud cap and some platforming you can reach it and enter the wing cap level i don't like that there's the cloud cap because the cloud cap is break all the visuals it's gonna make it so you can see all the magic happening and i i hate that we can't have that so we need an alternate way to enter the wing cap level the question is how luca don't kick fate i don't know what that is you're talking about my hair zayna cut my hair and she fucked up a little and then she had to cut this short and true alex i might still do something like that um i have that in other levels so the code for that already exists i would just need to port it it wouldn't take a lot of effort this is my tree see that's the super happy tree that's what this is gonna be i think it gives you a lift up the b power up from r16 warland no the b pump has the same issue as the cloud cap and we don't want to just randomly at the b part the flag i'm giving you a lift it's not really unlocking anything right so that's the initial idea for entering the wing cap the initial idea is there would be a cloud cap box here and you collect the cloud cap and the cloud cap allows you to jump into the clouds here and as soon as you jump in the clouds you pop out hello cop la mal i've already mentioned your hair because it looks like the hair can they give to the kids drafted in the korean army ha ha ha ha i was thinking it's the levi the levi almost kinda it's kinda the levi so why would the cloud cap break the magic because when you use the cloud cap you can like jump up here and then look down here and it's gonna look really bad or like you know you would see this area here which wouldn't be there yo thank you for the 10 usd granada home love your work madness rank keep it up perhaps thank you thank you clean haircut though well i'm glad you like it my wife did it i am too cheap to go to a barber i'm gonna ride about yoshi by hatching its egg then you can glide up from high platform to high platform same issue there's also the issue that there's warp transitions here so that means you could take the yoshi everywhere in the entire world or the yoshi will just have to you know kick you off or something do you not want the walls to extend higher um there is a chance the walls extend higher but you also have to keep in mind okay when you have the cloud gap here what's stopping you from like walking over here and using it and breaking the magic here it makes it so we have to be a lot more careful with how we have to model the level and that's just not reasonable to work around you look like a teenager boy xoxo thank you what's your take on mcdonald's easter advert that currently always plays i don't know what that is hello i don't know muscle thank you oh what was that thank you for the 19 months subsonic the hedge god i forgot to mention this but drug boss mario now has insider trading that's how i should have called it it's um yeah it's funny i like the game i think it is generally like a fun game to play no it's better for bikini bottom music stream the mixing of your voice to the music is a bit quiet yeah it doesn't seem that way to me but i can turn it down slightly how much area is not covered yet i'm in the yoshi shape around 50 percent it's just a bunch of clouds then no it's um this is what the stage looks like well this is before biomech reworked and it looks a lot better now but you get the idea it's in the clouds okay this is really old it's a lot more cloudy right now this level actually looked decent before biomech reworked that like i don't completely hate this it's kind of nice even more quiet music or more loud voice oh my god no way the opposite okay well then i'm just going back to normal you have an enemy npc somewhere and they return by inhaling and spitting you out shooting you into the sky that's not an awful idea and bianco's crossover i don't know what that means in this context here chukster yeah chukster is an accurate description of what was said you called the unworked level design decent it looked so bad to me so bland yeah i think it's decent it looks clean at least you know we're being launched or blown up at some point what makes sense given the level right what i especially like about the level entrance that i had written down though is that it is directly above kuba wave cove and if you look at the the stages you see that the levels have like the same enemies and they have the same theme with the storm clouds right just as we go and the others above so it's kind of a neat little detail that you find out and that the level is directly above kuba wave cove so if we could make the level entrance synergize with that that would be great oh i see what you mean bedtime no before bedtime dude how do i shorten your name stormy version of the cloudy version that makes zero sense having wind here somehow would work there could be like a crater here and that shoots up wind or something no i oh that's an an i not an l because i read your name like nolo maybe i should just call you nolo i think that would be funny nolo it's supposed to mean no input output before bedtime as in you don't go poop or eat before you sleep interesting what if you climb something like a tree jump down onto something bouncy like a mushroom and it bounces you into the sky climbing up a tree is like already a decent idea she's in lots of different forms again some of those clouds and okay i'm just gonna ignore that i don't understand um true robbie and the overworld is all connected till as in the entire overworld is going to be one huge map that's going to be seamless so you're going to be able to go everywhere without warping or anything it's going to feel so cool anyway tree climb up and then a bounce yeah a bounce with momentum like that so we would need a trampoline and what should you hear let me think is there like a yoshi trampoline i googled yoshi trampoline and i found inflation porn of course you can't this is cursed um yeah that's actually the one thing that i don't like about the spawns idea is that it's not an unlock no i'm not putting an inflated yoshi and i just googled yoshi trampoline because maybe there was going to be a yoshi themed trampoline or a trampoline a yoshi game and there was just yoshi inflation porn on my screen as soon as i typed that into google hello satella it looks really pretty so far as we can see games can run on an actual console um yeah it runs at 60 fps on a real console i can show you real quick although what you've seen looked like dark shits in the stream because that's temporary stuff that's not gonna make it into the game i hope it boots right now otherwise this is gonna be embarrassing Yeah, look there, 60 FPS. Let me just maximize this real quick. This is the stuff that looks good. There, 58 FPS. Ignore the artifact thing, that's my recording setup. You even have graphic options like anti-aliasing on. And I hate the dither. Without the dither, it's sharp. With the dither, it's instantly washed out. Still 40 FPS. Isn't that cool? Look, and if you have a widescreen TV, you can even turn on widescreen. And it's still 62 FPS. Okay, why is it 62 FPS? Okay, that's more reasonable. 30. Isn't that cool? Widescreen does cost a little bit of performance. See, now it's like 10% higher. You mentioned wanting it to be an unlock. Is there an unlock criteria you already had in mind? Well, that's why we had the cloud cap at first. That's the problem. Maybe it should be overworld events. Okay, so I didn't say this before, but there is an overworld event here. Right here, pirates attack. Should try Donkey Kong 64's lag fixing method with this hack. What is that? I don't think there is a lag fixing method. Anyway, pirates are going to attack here, and you're just going to beat them. Maybe the pirates can be linked to the cloud cap opening up somehow. One second, someone posted a high score. Dude, I love that the beta testers are playing Drunk Mario 64. It's been a joy seeing the testers interact with this game and seeing what they do. Because there are so many different strategies in this game. Basically, just because the game is speeded up during lag, the game never lags enough to slow down. The game never lags enough to slow down. Get fucked. Didn't you just say you don't want the cloud cap in the overworld at all? Exactly. That's why I'm rethinking the method. I wouldn't call that a lag fixing method, though. I would call this a workaround. I did this in Star Road N64 back in 2020. You get the bouncy enemies from Yoshi's Island, I guess. Maybe you inflate it for something from the pirate event. Let's see, what are those? Yoshi's Island bouncy enemies? This guy? No. This guy has potential. Yoshi's Island enemies. Hello, Yoshi Party. We are having a Yoshi Party. Boo Balloon, Flamer Guy, Chain Chomp. Jean Defilé. No, I don't see any of these working. But the pirates having something to do with it would be great. We can also just make up a new overworld event, you know. There is plenty of space for that. Look at this. I was sending six, so a pirate invasion. One Kamek boss, one Kamek boss. The Wump. Two stars are already determined. Two have question marks. And then we have... No, not side levels, hidden levels. One, two, three, four. One of the secret exits from part six is gone, so there's just one. So yeah, we have... Seven... Nine stars left to put in the overworld. So we can put nine events. So if we have an event that would work with this, then that's also good. But I just realized I should be putting the star in the overworld here. The first one. Just because this is gonna make me feel good. Oh. Well, that makes a lot of sense. New star. Zero. Model star. I like the idea of there being a star visible the whole time you play the game, and you have no idea how to get to it. And then later you unlock it somehow. Yep, that looks great. That's such a tease. The star is just there the whole time, and you have no idea how to get there. This is great. Yeah, no shot. What about the cannon? Hello, tea time. Could I have a rayman that causes some bouncy shrimps to grow? Don't know if you want events to be more evolved, though. Mmm... The thing is, events need to be something you beat and then they give you a star. And then that permanently changes the overworld in some way. That's the way I had envisioned it. So, heavy rain. There could be an enemy that causes heavy rain, and everyone's like, Oh no, it's raining. This is gonna ruin Yoshi's Island. And then you beat them or something, and that causes mushrooms to grow. Is there an enemy that would cause rain? Maybe tea time. I'm not 100% sure yet. They might be somewhere in the background. I feel like that would be very fitting. Maybe a flycat scene from the Goomba King boss fight? That makes no sense to me. Heavy rain event. Is there a Yoshi's Island enemy that would cause heavy rain? I'm not putting stuff from Mario Bros. 1 in this game. Instead, I would just make up stuff. Stormy Lakitus. There are Stormy Lakitus in Yoshi's Island. In fact, we have a Stormy Lakitus boss fight in Koopa Wave Cove, which is the level that is supposed to be below here. So, if we did that, we would kind of just be using the same idea twice. Are the events a replayable thing, or a thing that can only be triggered once? They only happen once. And they happen with no warning in the overworld. The idea is that these really make Yoshi's Island feel alive, and like it's an always-changing island with things always going on. Do we have Chaos Crystals and Star Bits? I don't know. Maybe rain isn't the right idea, because Course 9 is already like a stormy level. Cloud Boss Yoshi story? Let's see that. Cloud and Candy? Baseless Productions. 2012. Cloudy Gin? Oh, I can look at that too. What does he do? You eat his cotton? You just eat him? Oh, that's so funny. Baseless Productions. Interesting wobble. Wobbly effect. So he just drops spikes while you shoot at him? Oh my god, that's crazy looking fire. I'm not convinced on him as a boss fight. Something with mushrooms works though. Like a guy comes and he's like the Mushroom Man, and then a bunch of mushroom sprouts, and he's like the Evil Mushroom Man. I sound like a four-year-old kid describing a dream I had. One of those bosses was named Mundgeruch Kaiser in German. That is very funny. Magic Beanstalk? As in some scammer just sells you a bean, and you have to buy the bean? Oh, actually that's a thing we could do. We could make it a shop thing. We could have the entrance be something you buy. I kinda like the idea of that, because we don't have many things you have to buy yet. I realize right now that we definitely need to add things that you can buy, otherwise you're gonna go your whole life collecting coins not knowing what they're for. Yes, we need to add shops. Like if you have random mini-events that are replayable, maybe something like the Hammer Bros. 5 and Arbor Bros. 3. Well, they're gonna permanently change the overworld, so for that reason they cannot be replayable. And if they don't permanently change the overworld, then that's kind of lame. Hello, Ayahuasca? Yeah, we need to add shops. This is actually very important. We need to go back and think about that. Sorry, someone's pinging me. This might be important. Nope, it's not. Right, we have Peggy Derm blocking the entrance to Course 1 that you have to buy. So that's good, very good. I want to add something here that you can buy. Or maybe here? What if the Ice Cap hint was something you have to buy? I don't think that works, because there's the message in the bottle thing. The Zoo Ticket is something you don't buy, because there's the penguin thing that you do. And the message in the bottle just spawns in the 10 stars. So maybe someone sells you the bottle? I don't know. Maybe that sucks. I definitely need something you can buy, though. Like, for sure. Hmm. Maybe the cannon has a bob-omb, and you're like, well, I already used my cannon, but it's expensive operating this thing. I'll need you to donate 200 coins. I think that's fine. Then this is not an immediate unlock. And instead, when you get here, you can do the rope thing and this thing. We'll do that. The bob-omb that owns the cannon wants 200 coins from you to cover operating costs. I think that's fine. We just need ways to actually make coins feel valuable as well. This is a complaint I have playing almost all Zelda games nowadays. And I don't know if this was different back in the day, or if I just perceived this to be different because I was a stupid kid. But it seems to me that in Zelda games, rupees don't do anything anymore. Just me? Or is this something everyone feels? Playing Echoes of Wisdom, whenever I found a rupee, I actually just yelled, useless! Because, you know, they were useless. Is that a bottle opener for the bottle? Anyway, I think if you have to buy the entrance to this level, that works. Anki is great to catch the stream again. I had to scrap the original design for my game hub because it was turning out great. So I made some more Civil Visions and it was far better. Oh, it wasn't turning out great. That sucks. Early game gating, that's what rupees are for. I mean, I guess that's what it does on the Kokiri Forest. And I guess you need the Hylian Shield, but it's so cheap that it doesn't really matter. I guess you also have to, or you can buy a tunic? I'm not sure. Does it not do anything else in the Zelda games? I know in Tears of the Kingdom, rupees were kind of important. But selling stuff at the shops sucked because you could only sell one at a time. Hmm. Anyway. Hello, Biobak. We're currently thinking about how to enter the Wing Cap level. Originally, the idea was that there would be a Cloud Cap to do this. But having to design the entire overworld around the player being able to gain height with the Cloud Cap is not reasonable for us. So I'm thinking of alternate ways. The two prominent options we have right now is an overworld event. For example, there's an event where pirates attack. And you beat the pirates. And then permanently what that does, changing the overworld, is that there's going to be a sunken pirate ship here. The other prominent idea was that this is something you have to buy. Maybe you have to pay like a Yoshi. And he's like, oh man, I wish I could grow my tree or rebuild my house. But I don't have any money for materials. Can you give me 500 coins? And then you give him the coins and he builds a house. And then you can build it up here. Fair enough. Yeah, I can see that too. I want to show you guys an idea I had that is really cool, I think. I made this change in the overworld off-stream. You know how this overworld here leads to the Broken Castles? Actually yeah, this was supposed to be the Broken Castles overworld. Anyway, this is where the Bomb Factory is. So we got all this stuff here for the Bomb Factory. You kind of have to get up here. And then you can enter the top part. Anyway, the cool idea I had was that right here, there would be a breakable wall that you can break with the bomb cap. And then when you go through here, you arrive at this part of the overworld, at the hidden part. And now I have a completely different angle on this. And there needs to be something hidden here. The level has rainbows, so what about the rainbow-themed event? Like, you climb up somewhere on the ground by the cloud and the rain creates a rainbow to the level. Is there an actual rainbow in that level? I don't think there is. The main idea or the main thing that I think we should work towards with this level is to make it feel connected to Koopa Wave Cove. Because the level canonically is placed above Koopa Wave Cove and they have the same enemy. And above Koopa Wave Cove there's clouds and below the level there's clouds. So they're just physically next to each other. So if we could make the level entrance somehow exasperate that feeling, that would be the best. You're thinking of the cloud cap level? This is the wing cap level, I think. All my homies hop on Net64 and set that RAM usage to 16 MB. True. And one thing I really want to make sure of is that people see value in collecting coins or finding big coin stashes. So I do want there to be more overworld shops. For that reason I've made it so that for this canon here, or I will make it so that for this canon here, you will need 200 coins. There's going to be a bob-omb here, I'll let you use my canon, but operating this thing is expensive, so give me 200 coins. Of course at this point in the game you have 8 or 9 stars, so of course you are going to have 200 coins. And there's no other usage for coins that you would have had beforehand. If it's above Koopa Wave Cove, where does the big ass tree come from? That will be the next part of the overworld here, maybe. Or just somewhere in the distance, a big tree. 20 coins per canon shot? I think that would feel pretty bad. People like the idea of permanence. I don't know why I'm doing that, these are temporary clouds, that's a waste of my time. You should have to admit upon repeat usage that he was just outright scamming you the first time he charged you. That's evil. What if there were shops that could give you optional level modifiers, a shop that could unlock the winged cloud or bomb here, but levels that don't usually have it? No, you would have to design the game around that concept and it's too late for that. It is Bengus. Spin that fucker. Apparently a lot of people have seen the Chaos stream, that's funny. Yeah, so if there was a Yoshi that wanted to rebuild his house, I think that is fine. But that's like not a great idea, because that's something that we would like to use elsewhere. It would be in baby Yoshi's baby mobile or something. It's very baby-ish. I just like the idea of positioning this directly above Koopa Wave Golf, because they use the same Goonie enemies. Hello, Japan 100. Animals that uses its long neck to reach you into the clouds. That's not a terrible idea, but there's no C here. The cloud level would make more sense above Koopa Wave Golf with the color scheme. Maybe. Hello, Mario Nova. But it's the same enemies and there's clouds above one and clouds below the other. I think it's fine. It being above the other was honestly more of an afterthought than something I 100% intentionally did. Oh, there's a lot of clouds in the other level too. You probably didn't really see them because they were not really part of the model, but more part of the skybox. Let me just re-import my test overworld and then I can show you, I think. Oh yeah, Pop Quiz. If I render 50 Goombas in my engine, 50 at the same time, what do you think the framerate is going to be on the N64? 32 FPS, 420. This is the Goomba pit. I needed this for a video. You guys want to see it? Let's see it. Hello, Epic Legends. 45. Anyway, let me get to the wing cap level. Hello, Arthur Tilly. Ah! My microphone. Yeah, so you see the clouds below here. This is kind of the idea. Although I agree, it's a very babyish level. I saw it, Arthur, but I mean, it's kind of funny. I just was yapping. Yeah, ignore those visual bugs. This level is fucked right now. I need to fix it sometime. Oh god, what happened to the wing cap? What happened to the rotation? Probably because I exported with the wrong F3D version. It's almost finished. What even left to do other than the overworld? Just some side levels. But yeah, the overworld is pretty much the last part. Anyway. I think our best idea is an overworld event that just randomly happens. What if the overworld event causes the big tree to grow? That is in the level. So this is kind of the hub of the Yoshis. This is where all the Yoshis live. Is there like a gardening enemy in Yoshi? A gardening enemy in Yoshi? I don't think so.    Okay. Right now you can detect bugs if all the combinations lock on WSL. It's like really nice, because it's different engine. I mean, it doesn't really give me many warnings. I guess if I make clean, but like... Why would you listen to the compiler for bugs? I mean, a cloud that moves up and down to pick you up. That's... hollow. Yeah, this is a banger, Mitch. Hmm. You know what I forgot to add to this? This whole cave here is missing the roots of the super happy tree in the room. Hmm. That is an issue. I think I'm gonna have to move this entire overworld down. I guess the super happy tree being in the middle of the island is also a good change. Hmm. Hmm. I kind of wanted it around here. Yeah, I think that's better. And this is why we don't finish any visuals yet. It's because I make changes like this and that would ruin everything. The crazy daisies are a cool idea. There's actually a whole side level dedicated to crazy daisies that Aza is working on. But because of that, I'm not sure I want to use them again. Because we already have a whole side level dedicated to them. Nova, are you famous now? That one guy was so like, oh my god, is that the real Mario Nova? Did you become famous? What did you do? Using the trick Biobak taught me. Hmm. What about putting the entrance in Koopa Waifu Cove directly? Hmm. A course entrance in a course. Hmm. Oh, the visuals are gigafucked. I can't actually check the level out right now.  The other two levels are in the hub. Needs that course in course feeling from Mario 64. Yeah, I like the idea of it feeling like anything can happen at any point. Let me look at Koopa Waifu Cove to see if there's any good ideas here. Which is the real file? Probably the rework one, right? Hmm. Sure, we'll upgrade. Can we have balloons? Maybe grabbing a balloon and riding up to the level. Oh. Yes, there are custom power-ups. But not as many as Lost Impact. Having it like that for Lost Impact kind of made no sense. I think 64 Land handled its custom power-ups pretty well actually. We won't have flat shroom in this game. Flat shroom in Lost Impact was so random. Literally anything can happen. There could be a power-up for anything. Can I explain to Cryptic so many things were missed out? You have no idea how cryptic it's going to be. We could, after literally every star you collect, pop up a text box that says Hey, did you know there is a secret course entrance in Koopa Waifu Cove? And you have to do these exact steps together. And then it wouldn't be cryptic at all. Based on that factor. Your message. What inspired your message? I can't figure it out. Is this actually the rework? I can't tell. Has this area been reworked? Yeah, Biomech definitely did this part here. Oh yeah, and the grass edges and stuff like that. Seagulls! Ah! Do you guys know what I'm referencing? Could be another crypt in the Yoshi room. Makes sense to me. A crypt in the Yoshi room. This room here. Dude, this is actually crazy. This is all you're ever going to see from the level. Despite that, we put pictures here. Easter eggs. What even is the point of this room? Is there just a Yoshi coin in here? I honestly forgot what this room does. Yep, Yoshi coin. Alright, got it. This looks really cool too. It is really cool. It's the vapor wave level. Is this where the baby Yoshi is sitting? Or it could be empty. Inside the room? I don't know, putting it inside the room feels kind of weird to me. Unless... We also move the Yoshi coin somewhere else. But then it's like, would you just shrink into it? I don't know about that. Shrinking it... But we kind of lose the idea that it is physically located above this level. Thank you for the five cat, EpicLegend. Which will be better to learn to use and make? UE5, Mario Galaxy 3, Blender, and SM64 Aromaic? Or Mario Odyssey Aromaic and LearnCode Plus? Then we're waiting on Nintendo. The most realistic one of these is UE5, Mario Galaxy. Because UE5.5 comes with support for planetary gravity. So it's already done for you. Although, you'd have to make all of Mario. So maybe Mario Odyssey is the easiest one. Could be a baby mobile with the platform's entry and stars attached to it. Hmm... Yes, I do use UE5 for my job. I don't know, I kind of like the idea of using a balloon. Because, okay, you know how there's the Star Festival here? During Act 3? What if during the Star Festival and at the end of the Star Festival... There were balloons around and you could kidnap one of them to fly up? I don't know. Well, the Wing Cap level literally has a baby mobile around it. Like, this is fully intentional. Why did I do that? I thought it was cool. That's the whole idea. Yeah, I'm still with Gears. They treat me very well. Hmm... Hmm... Why are we even considering not putting Koopa and Koopa in the order world? Because we have no good ideas for how to enter it. It doesn't really feel like it's above Koopa, of course, if I'm honest. Yeah... Maybe baby mobile is to play here. A mobile that you shrink into. That would make this room feel a lot more special, too. And it's kind of hidden, right? But also just taking any balloon. That's also kind of nice. Ah, this is a tough one, man. You can put a Yoshi coin balloon, though. That's true, but that would be a lot more difficult to do. I think maybe the crib is our better option. And yeah, I guess Yoshi coin balloon is gonna be the play. We could do it so that during Act 3, all the seals hold two balloons. And when you jump on them, they let go of them. And you can attach to the balloon to fly. You can fly up to the Yoshi coin. Hello, Mr. Right Place. When the levels are finished now, all 15 main courses are done. But some of them are still awaiting Biomech's rework. Oh, but I don't like the idea that a Yoshi coin is only available during one Act. That kind of ruins that idea for me. I think we need a different solution. Sorry, I'm gonna have to check this gun every now and then, because I will be picked up at some point, and I don't know when. The problem I have with balloons to enter the course as well is that there already is an above-the-clouds part here, which is this part here with the storm clouds. So it wouldn't make sense that that's not where it leads you. Yeah. So would he just be blowing up balloons here? And... Maybe... Okay. Okay, okay. Right here, there's a Toad with a box of unblown balloons. He's holding a balloon, and when you talk to him, he says, oh, I'm preparing the balloons for the festival. You can scare him with a ground pound or something to make the balloon fly up into a Yoshi coin. Then, during Act 3, all the Seals are holding balloons, and one of the Seals is right here. And you can jump on the seal to make it drop its balloons and then you can also just attach to the balloon to fly up to the Yoshi coin. I think that works. That way you can get the coin during any act. And that makes sense in the story. And we can change the crypt into the level entrance. Let's change that. Okay. The Yoshi room now has a baby Yoshi crypt. Walking at it will shrink you into it, warping you to the rooftop stage. The Yoshi coin will now move into the... What is it? The bottom right traverse next to the sand castle. There is a tote blowing up balloons in preparation for the festival on Act 1 plus 2. On Act 3, all seals hold two balloons and jumping onto them makes them drop the balloon. The balloons fly up into the Yoshi coin that is around that area. That works. The rater pipe is way too close to the spawn. The rater pipe is nowhere near the spawn. No, you cannot minx. Someone has to first port it there. And Alok said something about doing that, so maybe. Let's make only two coins available in every act, of course. All right. I think with those changes, it now works. I still want to keep the clouds here because I think they look very cool. And they're very fitting for Blueberry Code. But now we can move them out further, like so. Where they would actually be. And then I'm gonna add to my project five nodes. The clouds above where Blueberry Code is need to change color permanently. And actually, after a few years, Blueberry Code will be likely to return the colors. It is tea time, but that's not near a spawn. Funny that there was a question mark here. So I wasn't even sure about this the first time I wrote this down. All right. That makes that work. We can significantly shorten the overlap then. Because this is actually too big for what it does. So making it smaller is desirable. Let's actually see Yoshi Bowser fight going. I forgot. All right. It's under the roots of the super happy tree at first. And then it goes up here somewhere. I don't know. I still have to think about that. It's gonna be a weird one. The normal spawn is not in the hotel room. The normal spawn is on the shore. Yo, I have an idea. Can there be a lava stage too? Yes, there is a lava stage. There is a Koopa Carnival, which is a full lava stage. And then there is one side of a plant with rising lava. So this is going to be the shipyard. And once you have enough stars to power the ship, you can fly up. And that's the super happy tree. Dinosaurland also. Right. Dinosaurland also has some lava. Although calling it a full on lava level might be a bit too much, considering how little lava there is. Why is the map so big? Because we're still working on making it good. How many Yoshi stars are done? One. But they're all super easy to do. You can probably do like five in a day. So it's not like that's gonna be a lot of work. So we have the idea for the Bowser fight, right? Overall, part 13. Then we're in part 6. It's the heart of the island, transformed into Yoshi Bowser. Also Yoshi fight Bowser, slightly bigger and more brutal. And the rain starts. Ends up in part 9, next to the super happy tree. Okay, so the fight would be here. Everything is wilted and the fight with Yoshi Bowser starts. Okay, so we are gonna have to have a Bowser fight area here. I'm coding this in C. So if we need to have a Bowser fight arena here, we need to make this suitable for that. You can tongue and chew him. You can eat some of his own minion and shoot eggs. You can grunt on Mario. In that case, the tree might have to be more off to the sides. Let me open my Photoshop document here. What about an evil flower that tries to kill you and summons its flower friends? Why? It won't probably necessarily. So there is the part 10 entrance here. So we need to leave that entrance open to this side. The super happy tree can be moved out of the way. And we can put it on a bit of pedestal. Which I think would do it well. Like so. That will move it out of the way of the fight. We can just make thorn bushes appear around the arena or lava or something. What do we make appear around the arena so that Mario can't just walk away? I think thorn bushes work because the arena or the island is now set. Because Bowser ate the super happy fruit or the heart of the island or whatever. That's where the Yoshis get the powers from. Hello ninja girl.  Well, I mean, that's a lot of planning. We need to figure out the entire game right now. So yeah. I don't know if tedious is the word. But it's definitely something we have to be very careful not to make any stupid mistakes. Let's test the Bowser fight arena after the part six cutscene. There needs to be an openable hole next to the super happy tree roots. The arena needs to be unleafable. Maybe thorn bushes that spawn around? I think thorn bushes is good. Blocks the entrances, the way to the airship and the way to the super happy tree. That should be fine. And then the arena would be the middle part here.  are you ever would you ever be interested to try beating this bunch of scarabs movie game on gamecube emulators why are you saying trying to beat this is like a super difficult game or is this like so bad that i will try to quit either way i don't think i'm interested it's rather easy so why do i have to try i mean maybe one day i'll run out of games that i have to do something like that if any plans on having mario sleeping animation this game it is in this game i don't know i tried to play battle for beginning bottom on stream which is considered one of the best ones and i just on stream it's hard to play games for me i find it a lot more difficult to enjoy games when i do it on stream so it was not good but it is widely regarded as the best one so um almost all the songs are original not literally everyone though there's still some mario 64 influence in there hello cream teamer yeah i think this arena works for the boss fight i have one issue with this and that is that because this arena has to be suited for a boss fight it needs to be rather flat and empty and i don't like that  makes it really difficult to work around are you recording any audio sounds for the hack would you ever consider doing that audio sounds what do you mean of course there's custom sounds in here or well there is going to be a lot because we have a lot of unique mechanics then we'll need the sound effects to accompany them um no actually um a man in my discord dms drew that let me pull up his name so i don't just call him a man in my discord dms after sending me the thumbnail um let's see something link lincoln yes lincoln did this so this kind of works as the arena and then once the fight starts there's going to be thorny bushes here and the lava in the part here there's currently rock so the eeha at this point feels so natural at first when i put it in it felt so alien to me but now that i've had it in for a while it feels like it was always part of this same with the woohoo so anyway so we can put stuff around here that's no issue um this is fine too this area here is a flat fuck land and i don't like it and then this area here we can put yoshi hearts we can put um some wooden thing here that services the ship basically like a flying ship harbor i just don't like flat as fuck land this seems like a course problem to solve this area has to be there for a boss fight in the late game but we can't have the player like look at this and instantly be like oh yeah this is gonna be a boss fight arena um considering the island will be sad and wilted we could put plants here and then wilt the plants and flatten the land like that the eeha is from smash bros melee it's just part of mario's sound clips and the rest of the sound clips in melee are mario 64 sound clips so i figured this is very fitting it's like a missing recording from mario 64 you know yeah are just plants enough to make this work i'm not convinced you could add in moving elements that are either not there during the boss fight or at least unobstructed moving elements like what do this could be like a crop field or something like the yoshis are farming here this could be an apple garden what if it is an apple garden but then when you fight bowser it's just a bunch of wilted wilted trees that bowser destroys during the fight i think that's cool um this part is an apple tree garden at first during the fight all the trees are wilted and bowser destroys more like melons it could be a melon garden maybe a melon garden is easier yeah that's the melon do no just melons farming do be like that yeah i got internet explorer it's a banger so crumb rotation give higher yield long terms okay well they're yoshis they're stupid if you consider that Hello floof yep I know it's very clicky and for the longest time I have used NVIDIA broadcast to filter the clickiness out but NVIDIA broadcast keeps going to shit so I can't I don't want to deal with it anymore I think there should be a little bit of up and down to the fighter piece though just not have it be completely flat it needs to be even enough that we can easily make the boss fight work but not so flat that it's like obviously boring control E and then C is such a good trick I use it so much I'm so glad I know about it now I think that's uneven enough for the crop field all right so after this overworld we are going to part 10 which is going to need to be imported into castle inside so that's going to be a bit weird it's supposed to be a dirt texture it's supposed to symbolize the dirt for future me who will actually try to make this look semi-decent so no it's not supposed to be a texture it's supposed to be a symbol part 10 is going to be the mushroom planes all right have you guys watched attack on titan I need to talk about attack on titan recently it's peak isn't it and you guys ending haters no you like the ending I'm the number one ending hater a good mystery is one that as soon as you reveal it it makes everything that came before it to make more sense the problem is the ending makes no sense that's my beef with it see I'm rewatched it recently and like the moment the rumbling starts it's like okay I'm done here all the good parts are done this is a great ending just the rumbling starts now everything's over that's a good ending the whole story made sense it was teased well I'm satisfied the ending might not make sense but you still like this I guess you like the themes of the ending but it all feels so on earns bro was basically omnipotent at that point he knew everything and he's like oh yeah I planned to 80% genocide so you guys can kill me and be the heroes am I not a great guy huh oh and also this person that's been our slave for 2,000 years she's been doing that cuz she was in love with her pedophile rapist yep those make sense like no why what the fuck is that story how did it turn into that you guys know what I mean better I just know there was a ton of discourse about it dude the beginning is so good though it's really like I like it a lot up until the rumbling starts I definitely say it's like my favorite piece of animated media mm-hmm it's a very good so I'm not gonna even I hear it gets into some weird megaloponics that fucked the whole narrative up now the politics is the politics part of it this is very good it's a pretty good cautionary tale of like how propaganda dehumanizes people and makes people willing to do very inhumane things I think that's like the whole message of the show and it pulled it off very well and I mean it's the the proof and that it pulled it off really well is that a lot of people are saying that the characters were right in the way to act and like the characters were literally committing genocide in the show because of the propaganda and like there's people that don't see it because they do dehumanize the enemy faction I think the show is a parody of Nazi Germany no definitely not a parody even though the guy who made it is like a far-right fanatic in Japan it's like this weird self-aware thing for a dude who openly defends Japanese war crimes wait what I was not aware of that so I guess he also thought the main character was right and literally committing genocide and then he pussied out at the last moment on like going through with that narrative oh that's funny so this is going to be the mushroom plains lofty lumber leaps and maybe Marty's level entrance the other parts visible are going to be part 9th entrance part 11th and then there's the beach part 12 entrance which is the volcano and part 13 which is in the north okay how did I not write down our 13th entrance here wait what? part 11? part 11's entrance okay so I made a change here okay that's good to know part 10 needs the super happy tree seedling gotcha or well it needs something I don't know if we really want to go with the super happy tree seedling idea okay I'll tell you guys my dilemma so right here you're supposed to be able to enter this only after you beat the second bowser level for that my idea was that it would be these super happy tree seedlings one of them is going to be here and then one of them would be here that you can climb to make it there and honestly now that I think about it yeah I just need to do that because that's actually a great idea okay never mind forget everything I will literally just do it because I like it a lot okay can I boss on the volcano possibly I haven't really thought about it I think I will go down here right away what the hell is a programmer's digital keyboard never heard of that I'm feeling a little bit of an issue here right now and that is that we have to really plant the side levels yet hmm we got off mario did we plan that yes we did hmm okay okay can you bring me my mentality or do some parts have to be an assembly um you need to define what you mean by my mods because the question is a little vague right now there are some like the clicky keyboards that are for asmr fanatics I have a mechanical keyboard supposedly it can help you type faster so struggling on what's blocking the entrance when a bowser had a statue in the way and then after bowser to a piece from his destroying flying island holds and smashes it no no no I like the happy tree seedling because um we reuse this so you're gonna see one of the seedlings grow and you're instantly gonna know oh shit the other one grew as well there's more to explore oh music stopped let's see  I guess we're listening to this now meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow sorry I have brain tumors sometimes  because of work what's what gonna do against this song so keeping motivation is very easy you just mark that's it that's the whole secret make it make it make it I don't know man this is just a playlist that popped up got me but the  what if there were some stairs here I think stairs would look cool here I'm putting it is so flat okay guys bizarre question why I don't know if this is still going on but like when I was younger and there was music on tv all music was about partying I don't know if this is still going on but like   Why why is music all about partying like Surely that partying is not like the pinnacle of human existence, that's like This is what we all have in common. This this is what resonates with all of us humans partying This partying is fun, really? You see when rich people are people dreaming of being rich and rich by partying needs to flex No, it was more like oh, we're gonna go to the club and dance and get drunk and this is what we do Someone was economic what how do economics factor into this? Or a bunch of sad songs you just don't remember them No way 2008 top 100 song list Low low is about partying, right? What's the song about Bleeding love. Okay. This sounds like a sad song. No one. Okay, that's a sad song lollipop This is the song about oral sex, I think Apologize, okay. That's a sad one. No air. I Have no idea the love song, okay fine love in this club, let's go love song and a club song with you Okay, maybe it's all love songs and club songs I Say much more brain dead than now and all the songs are about party Oh True 2008 was like the economic crash or whatever. I Didn't even know about this as a kid Maybe it's I don't know must have not affected my family somehow I've got a lot stupider and more Jingoistic during the zeros as the war took off and things became more nationalistic Plus materialism and flexing became big things really ramped up in the Obama era from the perceived optimism of the era Everyone thought they were gonna make it financially. So everything was what clubbing and partying what it is that deep Me trolling I don't think brain rot is any worse than it is now. I think Brain not has a lot more attention on it, though People now do a lot of the haha. Let's say a bunch of brain rot words. Isn't that fucking hilarious? And it is pissing me off I Kind of don't like how this looks should be like this This is kind of nice  Will do this Like 2003-2007 was weirdly outstanding for pop music, but I hated like 90s or whatever from 2008-2014 Barring some of the old gee old Lady Gaga songs That's true. Lady Gaga was like really good at the time Was she the Beatles of our lifetime do you think I've heard that like the Beatles they sound like nothing special But it's only because everyone that came after the Beatles copied everything from the Beatles Don't know if that's true Genesis looked down upon my previous one and they are definitely noticing that I'm feeling insecure about not being in the previous generation Hatreds That that sounds very online brainwashed to me to be honest You need to be this bring a song, I mean I agree that they're boring ass songs, but it's probably just because They are like the prototype song that everyone copies now if what people are telling me is true  Have never even heard of radio I don't know where the sky is going but i know that you and me got something so many things that i'm afraid of  let's see might have to leave you guys because I was supposed to be picked up and we're going to all you can eat today this is free a because it's part 10 hey I have no proof yet that I need to leave so chill out bro I'm still working still can't get stuff done case I am big silly goose can you let me in the house okay Zainab's home and she doesn't know how to get in all right I'll get Zainab wait did we torture her did we torture her and like not let her in should I just open a poll on whether we let Zainab in or not okay fine I'll let her in all right apparently I have until 430 let's go we have 30 more minutes don't torture you woman are you crazy I agree for the most part yeah it's a nuance topic like women can take a little bit of torture 9pm case what are you talking about true I have never tortured my wife before huh huh huh where's my what sorry I know what happened I forgot to export this hello GTM thank you GTM yeah no I never exported the warp I didn't break it okay the loading time was noticeable there but honestly I think that's like mostly the 10 frame delay okay maybe not maybe this is an emulator thing actually yes this is an emulator thing of course emulators have much longer loading times than real and 64 I know it's stupid but it is like that have you guys played WarioWare for the Gameboy Advance the game is peak so this is going to be a plane full of mushroom and there's going to be a big tree here lofty lumber leaves unrestricted access via gondola did I get a shake of sand and look I know he's happy I need to see him feel it okay okay he did it okay he did it he failed no no the dog is crying it's so good Mario where feels like such a shit post how do we put the gondola in here I think Xena had a concept art for this component yeah let me find that this is not it nope nope i just see the lofty numberleaf's image hmm hard to tell hard to tell so do we just want it to be a gondola next to giant tree i think we could put a giant tree here and it have to be a gondola here like a giant tree here would fit pretty well honestly can we put a warpstar here we can do many things but we will not i want more more more i get a second chance i can't bend and now i'm acting feeling stupid all the way it makes me feel the light is in me yeah yeah yeah i don't know what to do i look for zeros everyday i guess they got lost or flew away waiting lines of waves and counting the days of november deciding it's good to stay now i'm so lonely now i wish what's wrong with this you do not wanna find the lava that can hold you i get a second chance i can't bend and now i'm acting feeling stupid all the way it makes me feel the light is in me yeah yeah yeah i get a second chance i can't bend and now i'm acting feeling stupid all the way it makes me feel the light is in me yeah yeah yeah talking to the moon hmm eh it's too high res i don't need to model the back side of this actually eh maybe we kinda do but only kinda like so so having this tree be in the background is going to be really cool cause you're gonna be like oh my god what's that big tree the whole time you play the game and then it's just the course 10 entrance do you think people are going to see some of these edging landmarks like the lighthouse or the volcano or what else is there the big happy tree or the big tree and be disappointed by it once they get there i hope not Biobak can change the collision while reworking but i don't think he does and it's not recommended he does Usually what happens is after this rework I make a collision map, because before this rework I often do not make a collision map anymore, because I know I have to remake it anyway. So really, when you see a level, then most likely it does not even really exist the collision map. I do not know if collision maps work, so I do not. Yeah, that is a good reason to not do it. Because I have a completely different collision system from R64. The more R64 one is not good. Did you know that there is a bug in R64 that you can trigger by spending 14 months inside of DayaDayaDox and there is no other way to trigger it? Fun fact. I do not think anyone knows about this. I think I just found the bug and I have not told anyone yet. Yeah, it would be a cutscene. Don't worry, I don't need any solutions for this. There is just going to be a gondola here that you can ride up. Actually, just having a gondola like that, unrestricted, is that a good idea? So course 11 is going to open up with an oil tanker where you have to beat all the enemies. Course 10, it says unrestricted access. Course 12, you have to buy a train ticket. Course 14, you have to rebuild. I think we have a bit of a problem. Look at this. After you beat the second Bowser level, you kind of gain unrestricted access to all of this. And that is a little much, isn't it? Isn't this going to feel overwhelming? I don't think Pine & Co. knows about this yet. I think it does smile back. I am pretty sure I fixed that. Truity time, that is a cute idea. Maybe we can do something like that. I kind of don't like how much of the world opens up. Maybe part 12 and part 13 should not be connected. Although I feel like you're going to go to part 11 first and part 11 being connected to part 13 is not great. Hmm, coin trawl. I am not feeling a coin trawl now. I think this would be less of an issue if part 13 was blocked off somehow. So you can't go to that right now. Because you go through here and then you can go here and you can go here into this part and you can go here and you can go here. That's like five overall parts unlocking at the same time. I think that is going to give some players choice paralysis. And it's not going to feel good. It's going to overwhelm them mentally. It's going to be like, oh no, I have to keep track of all this stuff. I've done so much. You know what I mean? It's not pleasant. What you do even when you're blind in the darkness, in the middle of the night, in the silence. When there's no one by your side to love and be near. If I told you we could live in all the nights, would you rise up? Come and meet me in the sky, would you trust me? When you're dumb and dumb and dumb and dumb. And there's poison in your head, and there's sadness. 1,900. Oh, that's perfect. That's cool. Has Course 10 already reworked my Biobak? LoftyLambalips? Yes, he has reworked it once. I don't know where the switch scene is. Shit, I still need to watch the second beta test of Course 11. I almost forgot. Hello, Akire. Well, I didn't get a new haircut on purpose, but my wife did cut my hair. And it looks different now. So, yes, I kinda got a new haircut.  People seem to like it, I know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  When I had to wear the hat, that was very funny. I remember everyone on stream was laughing at me because it was so bad.  What are these bootleg-ass song covers we're listening to? What the hell? Me when I order the M&M's from Teemu.com. You know, listening to this song was the first time I noticed that Eminem is just yapping when he makes songs. He's like, that was yesterday, but today is today, yesterday is a different day, because yesterday was yesterday. Some shit like that. And I was like, what the fuck are you talking about, bro? Yes, yesterday was a different day, we know. That's what yesterday means. That's what yesterday means. This again. Yeah, I guess it repeats. Who's your favorite musician? Apache. And Ymir. Dude, Ymir is so good. I'm putting on Ymir. Eminem is going to be such bullshit the moment you pay attention, I'm sure. Let's see, Ymir did this song here. Singer's name. It's an acoustic version, actually, of one of his songs. He makes the music too instrumental. Ymir is, in fact, also an Attack on Titan character. But this is the musician Ymir. He has way better music, right? Let me find a good one. Let's see, what's this most popular one? No, no, no, we got to listen to something good. This one. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Alright, I think this works for part 11. It really doesn't need to be more than this. Because it's just going to have the oil tanker. Is this sex music? How is this sex music? What? I don't think this is funk. Isn't funk something completely different? I don't know. The bushes and the zoo level don't really fit the level. Interesting. You gotta complain to Biomech about that one. I don't know. Bush expert in the chat. I don't know. I don't know. When will this game roughly be finished? I am not sure. Nintendo might just murder me. And then I have to re-run this game without loading or something like that. You know? Maybe I should do that before I release it. So that if they do kill me, I can just be like, wow. I thought about this. I knew this was going to happen. Fuck. I exported the wrong one. There we go.  It is roughly finished now. It will be fully finished later. That is factually correct. Yes, the game will release in the next 36 years. I can promise that much. Yes. That is not a risky statement. I am very confident it is going to release in the next 36 years. We gotta get ready. Uh-oh. No!    Well, we got the outline for part 9 done. Part 10 is going to be super simple. We are just going to have to put in a bunch of mushrooms here. Part 11 is also very simple. I think I do want to put something here for part 13, so we still have to think about that. Something that makes it so you can't go there right away, because it's going to be overwhelming. I think part 12 can stay open, as is. And then we have the sketch for the overworld finished. Hopefully we can finish the first draft of the overworld within the next week or two. I think that is my goal. That's true, Sonic, but even with a custom character, we can recreate that fundamental building block, I think. We would not need to change the maps that much. I mean, it could be mostly the same movement. I think Nintendo just doesn't want us to use Mario. Because if Brodude and Marlon's game can survive, and they're basically just copying Mario's movement, then we'll be fine. The game is around 60MB right now. I hope so, but that would be very cool. I'm going to have to do the course 3 analysis soon. And then hopefully that's going to be good. Maybe I can have one person beta test course 3 before that. And I also have to watch the course 11 beta test. And oh my god, I have so much stuff to do. And I need to record my next video. Anyway, I need to leave now. So I will see you guys in the next stream, which hopefully is going to be on Tuesday. But no guarantee. Probably, I mean for sure, there will be a stream on Saturday. Bye bye!
