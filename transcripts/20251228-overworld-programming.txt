Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Hello athletes. I am Lemon Lover. I just applied a bunch of fixes after seeing your playthrough. If you wanna know them, I added the pop up for the B button to the minecart shooting. I made the digging molds appear after the bankbreak. I replaced the change block for a rock. I used coins to lead the player up the mountain at the end of the retro section. The temple being banded is now updating the egg coin position properly. I added some things to increase the range multipliers for the egg coins for the bandit and the thief guy, which makes them a little less misleading. The piano guy now just tells you to just listen to the music. I also need to increase this multiplier. Did I do that? Stop Mario with doing the weird minecart thing. And I added a normal warp to the minecart stuff. I did do that. Nice. Hello tiny man. So this is all done. We're ready for the next tester. I need to update the progress document here. Hello Trixie. It's back to the overworld today. We got most of Marty's level done. We'll do the rest when we also have the actors for it. Honestly, your test already went fairly well, except for those two egg cards at the end. Those two are definitely something I have to solve still. Other than that, I think the level is good right now. What do you think? Ask the person that played it. What state do you think the level is in? Is it looking generally good? Or is it still very rough? Hello Kazza. How was your Christmas? It was okay. Okay, so you think it's generally good. That's reassuring to hear. Oh, pretty good even. This is actually one of the levels I was the least sure about. Because it stands out among the rest of them. It's a little more experimental compared to them. We got any OST wishes today? Unban me if you're straight. I won't hurt your guys' feelings anymore. What an enticing offer. Does that mean I'm gay if I don't unban you? Oh, the slow and slow to start, yep. It's a big foul. Let me see, is this actually compressed? Yes. Yeah, some amount of verticality is good, I would say. Right, next would be the melon patch here. And the houses. If you read this, you are already straight, so no need to unban. Okay, nice, nice. I'm already straight. Oh, you're Karo6, I see, I see. See, the thing is, I don't handle bans on my Discord. You're going to have to complain to someone else. I explicitly don't handle them because it's annoying to me. I just want to do my work. Can you be so unmerciful? Boredom, no, not boredom. Annoyance is a strong emotion. And it is annoying to me to handle this Discord admin stuff. I'm here to make my game and make some money. Did you ever play any PC games as a kid? Yes, I played the Harry Potter games. And I played Age of Empires. What defines kid though? What's the cutoff? Because depending on that, I might have played more. You know what, we should just take a look at this level here. 6 to 13. If we count 13, then I also played Ace Online and Tribal Wars. They are both online games and you should not let your kid play online games. Bad idea. It's not good for them. Actually, Ace Online was the banger. No Warp Actor 4 ID. I thought I added that. Do you not go through a lot of work of adding that here? I don't know why we had so many viewers last time. Was it just MartyZawa? That's unusual. The Warp ID is 0. Oh. We still have the beta build flag on. No wonder. Could you tell me about sliding mode? There is something called a terrain. The terrain is defined per area. It can be snow, sand or slippery. On slippery terrain mode, if Mario enters any surface that's slanted, he immediately starts sliding. He's just forced into it. It's a really stupid way of doing it, but that's what I did. You cannot program shaders on the N64. I'm new to this, but I've seen a few videos. Are you making use of the expansion pack? This is using the expansion pack because that significantly reduces development time for me and makes this easier to work with. But I don't think we technically need it. You'd maybe get a few more load time hitches without the expansion pack, but overall it's not really making a big difference. No, I don't care about Mario Sunshine. This was going to be the next part of the Yoshi Village and we wanted a melon patch here. But now that I think about it, a melon patch is going to be super high poly. How many melons would we need to have here? Probably a shit ton. I think I have a melon model. Let me just get that. That's not a watermelon. That's something else. That's good. What is the name? Maybe, maybe. Melon tank. That's probably a lot better. Maybe, maybe. Don't use me as a shame. I got an important edit task if you're able to make it come true. It's really a thing. That's a complex video, so please, no. I don't deal with that. Maybe, maybe. Maybe, maybe. Give us time, give us time. Then this is a good start for a melon, I think. Consider hints to the Yoshi Island Core in early levels. Like marking on 1 just a general illustration of Bowser's Oily Boily Bay office. Bowser's Oily Boily Bay is way after UR where the Island Core would be. You find the Island Core after quest 4. Actually, quest 5. So the hints would have to be in the Rainbow Grotto. But the Rainbow Grotto is not physically nearby the thing, so... Okay, that's actually a banger. That just works. Sick. It was really worth it in terms of modding if you used it. I am not sure. I have never used it. Is that Falco Buster's tool? I don't get along very well with Falco Buster. So I don't wanna... So I don't wanna say anything about it that could be interpreted the wrong way. I mean, I've seen it on NPCs or even stuff like that. It's gonna have to let me go down the depth of the literature. The fact that I saw it in X-Files when I was like 4 years old. But that's because Mario was red and it was my favorite color. And it scarred you for life. That's silly. We could do something like this. Right, boss 64 is disabled by default. But honestly, I don't see a reason to use Bowser's Blueprint in today's age when the decompilation exists. The decompilation is so much more powerful than any binary modding tool. Are your FPGA and NES emulator currently PMU? Perfect timing for your stream. Do you ever consider running your own NES emulator? No. I have no interest in doing so. Emulation is already bad enough even without an extra buggy emulator that people need to support. You know what I mean? I don't care. That looks absolutely horrendous. Did they reinvent the train? God bless all of you. Have peace and love. Okay. I will. I will. Kinda like this for the melon. Steam Deck mod more powerful? I don't know anything about it. I guess same opinion as I had of the other Valve machines. Which is that the idea of there being just one machine that everyone has to support instead of everyone running their own computer is embarrassing. I would be very happy with that as a game developer. And we're already reaping some of the benefits of that, right? There's the... What is the other thing called? There's a compatibility button where it's like, yes, I have tested my game on this thing and it works. Like, that's awesome. Players can just be like, oh look, my machine is explicitly supported. It will just work out of the box. It's my PC for my living room. It's still a console. Oh, it's a PC slash console hybrid, I see. Yeah, so it is what I'm saying, right? It's like a pre-built machine that will function the same for everyone. And the value in it is that it functions the same for everyone. So you just have the button that's like, oh, my game is compatible. That's good. Steam Deck and Steam Machine both use SteamOS, which is a fork of Linux. Above is the Proton translation layer, which allows most Windows games to run on Linux. Okay. That's nice. Okay, I need a different OSD. This is driving me insane. Okay. That's a bit just as obvious. That's more than enough for your average backpack. Yeah, I can see the use case for it. I mean, especially as a developer, it would be great if a significant chunk of players were just using all the same machine. Actually, I don't want this to be symmetrical, so let me not grab this stuff. Since the follow-up of the 2015 Steam Machine and since Valve can't count to three, I believe it will be the last time they make a pre-built PC. Huh. I'm also very tired. Actually, I'm not that tired. I am modestly tired. Okay, you know what? We'll just use this texture. It is fine. But it looks so bad. Ah, I don't want to use it. Yeah, for 20 triangles it looks pretty good, but I don't think it looks good. You know what I mean? This texture is just ass. I don't want this texture. I wish I had like an HD version of this that I could downscale myself, because the way they downscaled this completely ruined this texture. If this wasn't downscaled by a complete noob, it would be nice. I'm looking for something kind of like this. This can work. And it is not downscaled yet. Okay, fellas, I'm looking for OST suggestions for today. You guys may tell me what to listen to, and we might just do it. I'm looking for a song. I'm looking for a song. I'm looking for a song. I'm looking for a song. I'm looking for a song. Let me show you what the texture would look like if it wasn't downscaled by a complete noob. Age of Empires 2? That's a banger. God, I wish they still made Age of Empires games that are good. Actually, I haven't played anything past 3. What is this OST? What is this? Rayman 2? I don't want that. Rayman 2 makes me sad to know it exists. Hmm... Oh, I knew he did Parthalax. But did you know he was also the voice of the Mump and the voice of the Bob-omb? Now that's elite ball knowledge. What is this? As the kids would say. I'm looking for a song. I'm looking for a song. I'm looking for a song. I'm looking for a song. What is Rayman 2 making sad? Because the textures in it look great. The art is well crafted. And I think the music is good. But you can just tell that the game has no soul, you know what I mean? It's very hard to describe. It's like they made a game and then they just took out the soul. These edges are more visible during color selection. I'm not sure what you're talking about. There's a lot of character-unique things about it. Hmm... Okay, let's look at this. Maybe when we look at it you can tell what I'm talking about. Hmm... Wow, do you not just feel empty inside looking at this? This is not the N64 version. Hmm... Let's get a look at the N64 version. Like yeah, the textures here are great. This is a great texture, but like... Something about this just feels off. It's not real. How do I put this into words? Does anyone else know what I mean? I don't know, I can't be the only one that feels this way, right? Hmm... Wow, my machine is dying. Hmm... I wish from the genie that my computer actually wasn't freezing up every few seconds. What does the genie do to screw me over? I don't think he can screw me more than my computer already is screwed. Hmm... Yep, I think that's a nice melon. Oh, this game's engine is quite awful. The source code of this run was leaked? Uh-huh. Sneak favorites? Okay, okay. It's because they had to make it for the N64 PS2 and Dreamcast. Too many references for what's the best effort on the style? It's the camera? Hmm... Oh, it's not supposed to look old. These are supposed to be fresh melons. That's definitely not what we want. Age of Empires is one of those games I wish I was good at, like chess or something. But I bet learning Age of Empires is a lot more fun than learning chess. Have any of you guys also had this experience where you're like, man, chess is kinda cool, I like the idea of being good at chess, and then you play chess, and you're like, I'd literally just rather play with a rubber band than touch chess again. Yeah. I was really good at chess, too. I think I was... I think I'm a natural at it. Okay, well, I should quantify. I wasn't really good. I was really good for someone who had never played before. But as a kid, I was scared to death of the main bridge area of Ragnarok because I saw a video of something, not sure what it was, if you remember, where the bull carousel thing was on repeat in the background. Chess seems awful, I'd rather be good at one of the tribe games. I'd definitely rather be good at Age of Empires. Actually, no, I think I'd rather be good at chess than Age of Empires, but I'd never want to actually play chess. Being good at chess gives you social credits, like being able to play an instrument, or knowing a lot about history. I am fairly sure that if you made this for a Gamecube, it would easily run 60 years. This is social more than anything. Yeah, that's what I'm saying, it would give you social clout to be good at it. Unlike Age of Empires. Playing chess with my older brother, he could guess all my moves in advance, and make sure that I win the game first, and I was supposed to be able to make it really good. I'm okay at chess. Okay. I mean, how does that quote go? Being decent at chess is a sign of being a gentleman, and being good at chess is a sign that you have wasted your life. But now the real question. Would you rather be good at playing an instrument, or would you rather be good at playing chess? If you had the choice between the two. Instrument, 100%. What? Everyone's saying instrument? Okay, that's surprising. You cracked that solitaire? I used to be really cracked at solitaire too. But yeah, I'm not impressing anyone with that. Oh yeah, the instrument is better overall? How so? I actually don't get that. From my perspective, it seems very easy to get good at an instrument. And it takes basically... It takes time, but it doesn't take the effort that chess takes, you know what I mean? If I saw someone who was good at playing an instrument, I would respect that a lot less than someone who's good at chess. Because when someone's good at chess, you know they suffered a lot. When someone's good at playing an instrument, you just know they spent a lot of time on it. Oh no, this is not about what you learned to do in Maroon. This is about... Okay, nevermind, I see what you mean. Nevermind, you understood it right. I'm stupid. Have you played Go? I have not. I have not. Yeah... I was under the impression that learning an instrument was not very IQ-loaded. How is it not? Like... What do you need it for? I was thinking of it kind of like speedrunning. For speedrunning, you don't need to be very intelligent, you just need to be dexterous. And I know some extremely unintelligent speedrunners that are extremely good. So I was under the impression that IQ helps, but it's not really a prerequisite at all. How long does it take to become fun? Instruments like 250 hours to become fun? Maybe 1000 to become virtuosic? I don't know what virtuosic means. 250 to become fun? I don't think so. I think if I started playing piano today, and I wanted to learn my first piece, say, the Daya Daya Dox OST, I don't think it would take me more than 15 or 20 hours. Am I delusional for thinking that? Is it going to be some sort of expression? I also don't think it's going to be a skill like that. If I was to play chess for 10 years, or hard for 10 years, in what percentage of the respective fields are they? Like what x% is going to be vastly different? Probably? Yes you are, you should try. I don't want to spend 20 hours on it. How long does it take to become fun? I will say though, it doesn't feel like I'm being delusional in saying that. Because I have played piano before, and I have learned Requiem for a Dream, and Fur Elisa, and I don't think it took me more than 20 hours to get started, to learn it for the first time ever. How long does it take to become fun? It seems a bit high? You think it's too high even? Okay. How long does it take to become fun? It's memory. It's still me trying to work out Twinkle Twinkle- Okay, no, that's completely wrong. Because I have learned Fur Elisa and Requiem for a Dream before, and they're both a lot more difficult than Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. I'm pretty sure I could just play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star within 5 minutes. How long does it take to become fun? Pick an instrument because of its artistic merits, I'd like to create something with shit on it. Okay, now when I say learn an instrument or learn chess, I'm not talking about learning to compose. I'm talking about seeing notes and being able to play them. I think those are two very different skills. Played piano for about 10 years and I had a skilled ceiling when it became about ear training and radio communication with other musicians. Okay. Learning a single piece is not analogous to learning to play chess well. Learn to play well in adjustment. Oh, that's a fair point. I could see that. He wanted to say learning an instrument is not just about being able to learn to play pieces, it's about something else that I don't even understand yet. I've made the best The Legend of Zelda mod of all time. According to me. Which is the missing link. But I hated the idea of Spark. It's fun. I don't count memorizing two songs as being able to play an instrument. That's like memorizing two openings. I see, I see. So the chat consensus is that there are dimensions to learning music that I am not privy to that would make this more interesting. Okay, so for you guys, being able to play an instrument also includes the ability to make up notes from scratch that fit a certain mood. Or that fit the expression you have in mind. Rather than just being able to replay the notes. I never perceived it that way, but that would make a lot more sense. Because if you go onto YouTube and you google best piano player ever, you're just gonna find someone playing like the Flight of the Bumblebee or Rush E or something. You know what I mean? And that does not require that. That is literally just map memory. Okay. It's not the part that's gotten boiled down to... I'm keeping the vibes going. Could it then be that there's two different types of playing an instrument? One of them being muscle memory and the other one being using an instrument to express yourself. And that when we talk about playing an instrument, we're being very vague in our language and don't really agree on what we're talking about. Okay. What's the first note on my field? The Yoshi's gotta eat. No, I'm right and you're wrong, obviously. Didn't consider that one. Okay. Have a fun afternoon. Look, I'm the worst drummer of all time. I guess to put it analogous to chess, it's like being able to play and express yourself using the piano without a pre-generated note sheet. It's just like playing a chess match and being able to play make a piece is like... Let me think. Having a lot of chess patterns memorized, knowing openings and stuff. Kinda. Replaying a chess match, yeah. I tried to find the closest analog to that. See, I can actually see the appeal of that skill. It's like riding a bike. Well, that's a little offensive towards people that play piano. I didn't want to say that. 20 meters? Minutes. Oh. I mean, I don't think learning a 20-minute piece is gonna be any harder than learning like a 3-minute piece. It's just way more time-consuming. Right? I mean, it's essentially just 7 3-minute pieces. I guess. They look like melon-cabbage hybrids. That's fine. Okay. Okay, so there's a forest clearing with the large super-heavy tree. Boltz is flying ship entrances here, which is going to be here. You have the ship built, but we need X stars to power it. There's a baby Yoshi that really can't wait for the ship to get finished building because he wants to ride it. He jumps on your head on entry. Okay. Do you use both hands to program? Yes. You could learn Requiem for a Dream in 20 minutes. You think I can do that? I was talking about 20 hours earlier. 20 minutes? That seems like a little delusional if I said 20 minutes. You don't have baby Mario, no. You are Mario. I don't want to listen to an AI drama right now. I don't think I actually want to listen to an AI drama ever. Okay. I feel like my key layout is the dumbest thing ever. Okay. How come? I actually have a similarly offensive take on this, that I think that... ...the node layout is the worst thing ever. Like, it's 12 steps. Why is it on, like, what, 5 lines? How does that make sense? Why are there some lines with, like, 3 nodes between and others with 2? Oh, I see what you mean. What is this? What is this? Oh? Oh. What in tarnation? What have we done here? Okay. Yeah, so this was going to be the ship that you fly in to get to the second Bowser level. It looks like this right now. I feel like it's probably going to improve this a fair bit. We might want to simplify this a little bit before we import this to our current area. But what is this? Oh. The Yoshi ship needs to be deleted from the game? No, it's awesome. Oh. Is this just missing? Yeah, the sailor's missing. Not there in the collision either. What is this collision map? This is how the level is supposed to work, by the way. You're on the MS Yoshi and you enter Bowser's ships. And they're supposed to be solid. Then you jump on them. And you go from ship to ship until you destroy all his ships. There's doors at the front of each ship. Unfortunately, we have a lot of... This level is old. It's not compatible with all the engine changes we've made since then. So we're going to have to update it a little bit. It's not going to be that much work. It looks a lot worse than it is right now, don't worry. Oh, this is like an old ship, I see. This needs to go up into the sky. I think we can make this part of the collision and part of the 3D model separately. That's fine, just do it. Restore it and just add some decorations to it. Those damn Yoshis. That's just what they would do. So, I need to add a node here. Later. I think it's all about 1 or 2 humans. And then we're going to start making this. Let's see what we can come up with. Let's see what we can do. I'm kind of amazed how much the size just fits over the placeholder. That's crazy. There are no Yoshi abuse allegations against him in the universe. So he never has to return for his crime. Let's see what I can come up with. Knots, just Knots, and shipwriting used to be ultra-advanced technology back in the day, really. What did you think of today's video title? I wonder which thumbnail actually... Oh my god. Why does just putting politics into the thumbnail do so well? Which thumbnail won? The one with just politics won. Awesome. Social experiment failed. Is Nintendo for Life famous or something? Everyone's talking to you like... Like PewDiePie just joined the stream. Yes, I upload one case per week, twice a week, or even more. And it's all bangers. No filler, all good. You got the Trump thumbnail? Upload some bitches. Yo, Lila, long time no see. You know what, having the stamp of the tree here... Nevermind, that looks terrible. Let's get a vibe check of this. Why are your babies attached to that ship? The eggs? They're balloons. At some point they capture a skyship from Mars, find the Oshis, and the entire integrity of the Oshi stuff. No, we don't want to be explicit about a story like that. Hello, TeraCroc. TeraCroc looks great, but stand out so much. Basic human would make them fit better in the environment. Nobody else can pull out this. Oh. Ellie, did you see Marty's level yesterday? He would love it. He would be like, wow! That's actually such a cool visual. You can use NVIDIA 3660. Okay, so obviously the wooden blocks need to be better. Yes, 3660. Maybe 3060, I'm not sure. And there needs to be a better way to get onto the ship here. Once it's ready for takeoff. We might just have to lower the ship into the ground a little bit. What about fitting something into the space of the game? We can fit as much as we want into the space of the game. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The watermelon look awesome for just being 20 polygons, don't they? Given their size too. Yeah, but the ship is not good. It needs to be in the ground or something. This is just not viable. Ruining your immersion that there's the MS Yoshi. But it's never said that they built the ship. You can come up with any explanation you want. They just have the ship. It could be many ways to get it. Just because we don't explain it, it's not a plot hole. Actually, wait. It's a plot hole when you don't explain a thing or is a plot hole when something explicitly goes against the established rules of the universe. Because when something just isn't explained, I'm fine with that. When something goes against the established laws of the universe. Hatred. The latter. Nice. It's fine then. My headcanon. You can have a headcanon. This game is explicitly asking you to have a headcanon about some things. It is okay to have a headcanon on a video game. Okay. It's somewhat sad when you don't explain. Wait, so there's two different responses now. Which one is it for real? We will never know, I guess. I guess the staircases here need to look different for this to work. What if you put them on the other side? Then we make kind of a hole here. Okay. I can just do that. We can look for a makeshift that looks proper. I know what you mean. Biobank is definitely going to rework the ship in the end. So I don't want to put too much time into just making it look good right now. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's a plot hole. I don't like the word plot hole for it though. That sounds like there's just something missing there. When really, the whole entire universe has just collapsed. The illusion of this being a real world has been shattered. My immersion is ruined. My day is ruined. And I trust that monster's ink. Immersion is important, even if it's a children's platformer. Being like, oh yeah, this product sucks, but it's made for children, so that's okay. That's low. Oh, it's for children. So it's okay if it sucks. Gotcha. Children don't matter. I forgot. Sir, you cannot put asbestos into cereal. Oh, it's for children. Nevermind. Go right ahead. It's okay if it sucks. It is for children after all. They're all in N64 resolution sizes. Just a bit smarter about it, I guess. Hello, Eggnog. Shimmering used to be a spaceship level tech back in the day, but it used to present vials, so being so technologically challenged is weird. Are the Yoshis technologically challenged, though? I managed to make them look so detailed. They just do, honestly. Didn't do anything. Hello, Swizardro. I'm not sure. I mean, if it bothers you this much while you're drunk, it's probably also going to bother you while you're not drunk. But also, like, no one's saying the Yoshis built this. Could be anyone. They could have just thrown it. Not that Yoshis would ever say that they built it. And that's what I mean by this game explicitly asks you to make up your own headcount. There's going to be things that just aren't explained, and it's just... you can make up the explanation. The game leaves gaps on purpose, so you can fill them with things you like. There are things that are fixed in-universe that have a ground truth that you cannot ignore. But the Yoshis building the ship is not one of those things. I did not see that lemon. What is it? What is it about my Course 12? It's presented? Okay. Yeah, the Rayman 2 textures are so nice, which makes me even more sad that the game looks the way it does. Soulless. 61. You made it easier to get out after a small area. There's the entrance for the second star subarea in Course 12. I don't think I've heard you say anything about this. It's easier to get out after a small area. There's the entrance for the second star subarea. I have not. Maybe I should. It doesn't seem like such an easy decision to make. Oops, what the fuck? Oh no, I just got the urge to say another thing that will make me unpopular. I'm sorry about this one in advance, but if any of you read Eminem's texts, what the fuck is bro talking about like 99% of the time? I noticed this yesterday for the second time. Can I rap to Eminem, yes. Eminems are pretty tasty, but what is going on with Eminem? Just look at any texts. I rest my case. Many are saying this. You mean the actual lyrics? Yeah. There was another song I saw yesterday, which was I think Not Afraid. That's like I'm not afraid to take a stand. You should always be yourself. I'm not afraid to say this. Oh, really? You're not afraid to tell people to always be themselves and give it their best? That's so brave of you, bro. Wow. I wish we had more people speaking up about this issue. Rappers have never seemed like society acceptable actions to begin with. It's not about being societally acceptable. It's just about what the fuck are you even saying? If you want to make a rap where you call someone a slur and then send them death threats, that's fine by me. At least it makes sense in the end. I might disagree with the message, but there can be something artful about you just spreading pure hatred, I guess. But Oy vey, that's a gay looking boy, you go to a mess and they see you're a gay looking boy? Like what? What the fuck? I'm not even joking. My favorite rap album is literally just an hour of death threats. Hello, Marty. That little bro was typing whatever shit was passing through his head. How do you limit vertex colors to your current selection? I've never been able to do it. It's the button up here. The paint mask. Isn't the point of a lot of rap to be crass and controversial? Probably. 32. Well, actually, maybe I don't know what bit depth means. Music to be murdered by had a few good tracks. I'd also track written by a 50 year old about hating his stepdad. What's your favorite rap album? Zootsie Apart by Hollywood Hank. It is a German rap album. You wouldn't get it. And every time I look by this coin, now that I turned on the reflection intensity, it looks so cool. And then you look closer and it's like you can see the color stepping. It doesn't matter which language you use. Well, they're all the same. But I prefer to see the most just because it's like. And that's what you tell it to do, usually. The bit depth of most of these is either four bits or eight bits. OK. I think this is a little more acceptable for the ship. I think the wood should be just a solid wood block there. It's a bullshit statement. I guess it's true. Like, if you look at this, this just looks fucked up. But it looks extra fucked up if it's the lighting. You know what I mean? It's like something out of a 3DS game. Well, it is a modern material, so that kind of makes sense. Do you think I'm normal for reflections? Yes. I'm sure there are games like that made by beginners in Unity. I like Paper Mario. And I do wish there was a good Paper Mario. If there was one Paper Mario mod I would want to make, it would be Paper Mario Color Splash. Except all the battles are removed. Just make that and see if it's a better game. It will be a better game. Like, prove it. I'm going to rty to all you friends. Let's go. It's supposed to be a special item to aid speedrunners. It would be a bit more out of the ordinary than other objects in the game. Yeah. That's why I was thinking it would be cool if it had a proper normal map. Okay, the way the super big coin works is... It exists only in super special locations that normal players basically will not find. I expect the average player to play through the entire game and not even know these coins exist. But if you know where they are you can go and get them and you get a lot of coins at once. So if you replay the game in the future ever, you would know about these things hopefully. And then not have to grind for coins. Might make the game too easy if you're a completionist. No. No. How does this make it easier for completionists? Even a completionist wouldn't even know about this. And easiness is not a worry we ever have anyway. A game being easy is good. A game feeling easy might be an issue. People don't know this, but they actually want easy games. They just want to say that they like hard games. That's when Dark Souls is popular. That's a ragebait, I don't actually know how hard Dark Souls is. I apologize for the ragebait. I will do it again in the future. I don't wanna Jordan. Make it fun and fair. Yeah. I love uncooked chips. That's not a joke. That's how we do it. That's what we do. The Bitcoin saves to your EP file, so you can't collect it twice. I am absolutely hoping that we'll get a clip of someone collecting the coin. And then showing it to their friend, and it's not there anymore. Because it won't be. Because you've already collected it. But the idea of that happening to someone is so funny to me. Transfers again. They save to your game file. So they are unique collectibles. But they don't count towards your 100% completion, basically. There's no way for you to tell how many you have, or how many there are left in the game. The main reason to collect them is to just get a shit ton of coins. One of these coins gives you... I mean, it depends. We can just set them per coin. What I was thinking, the average one was going to give you 200-500 coins. Oh, you mean in general. There are shops in the overworld that you can buy changes to the island with. Exactly, the ants clip is exactly what I was thinking of. Yeah, it's just a neat bonus for people that go explore areas that no one else would explore. I don't know if I want to show you guys any of them, where I placed any of them. It's probably better you guys just experience those by yourself. I don't think it will change the balance at all for a normal playthrough. Because people will not find that they're normal playthroughs. It is going to change the balance for speedruns, in a good way I think. Because speedruns usually rush through the game when they don't collect enough coins. Oh. Who invited the cats? Hmm. It's no longer Angel of Empires. Oh right, Ila is a puppy girl, I forgot. You know what? This has actually been surprising to me. How come there hasn't been a furry uprising? People still talk shit about furries, which is weird to me. Because they are in a vast number and they are powerful. They should be able to be like, that's offensive, shut up. We're going to de-platform you for this. How has that not happened yet? Best to control from the shadows? Oh, I see. I see. I guess not everyone likes that stuff. Oh, you think they don't want to be in power? They'd rather just live in the shadows of society? They are powerful, but ashamed. Is it like being ashamed of your sexuality or skin color by agreeing with the majority? Really? I don't think so. I see a lot of furries being proudly furry. A lot of furries are self-hating. Oh. Tier level 434, that's an issue. Did we add a new material just now? Is it in here? Raven is 434. Want to make sense of it? The big can is appearing random, so you can have a number of places where you can spawn? No. That's nonsense. That ruins the point. Wait, I know which material we added. This one here. This one. Might be important, ping. Start putting in a cruise ship level into one of your hacks. I think we have something similar planned here. Are furries making strange things in show-ons? The show-ons don't say anything because they don't like to have attention. Oh, I see. So it's kind of like conspiracy theorists. Maybe you believe Jeffrey Epstein is still alive, but you wouldn't say this out loud. Because it's going to put you into the conspiracy theorist bucket, which also has people that are like, Flat Earth is real. And like, you don't want to be put into one bucket with the insane people that think the Flat Earth is real. Yeah, or people... Well, I guess people are more open about that one. That is a more accepted conspiracy theory. I see. So it's just becoming outcast by proxy. I see. See, in the ROM-making community, we joke about the BE files, the B3313 files. Where if you help make B3313, you are on the B3313 list. It's just as bad as the Epstein list. Yeah, I want some place to stand on to make getting on the ship easier. Because I don't want players to have to do this jump. I know it's an easy jump, but I don't want players to have to do that. I see. Christian was a fan of everything that most people liked. What do you mean? Oh, was Scallog's community very anti-furry? Scallog's community was very anti-everything, to be fair. As long as you were not, like... As long as you were literally a straight white male, as much as this is a meme now. But as long as you were not that, they basically hated you. And even if you were a straight white male, if you liked me, they also hated you. Even if you were a straight white male, if you liked me, they also hated you. And that's not even memeing, that's just what it was back then with the Scallog's community. They were kind of a shithole. It was the 4chan of romhacking. Yeah, he's probably calmed down. This was like 2018, that's when I last had any contact with him. No, it was definitely him. I know nothing. I livestreamed like 3 times this week already. I would stream again tomorrow, but my wrist is still in pain and we're going to an aquarium tomorrow. What's squiggling on? That's a crazy thing. I think for these we want Zayna to make the hats, so I will leave that open. Let's make a mark for that. Let's make a mark for that. Maybe the wrist? I don't know, it just started hurting. Scallogs was the guy that was making Mario Star Road for Nintendo DS. He was also the guy that made Mario Star Road. Okay, but I can deadlift like 450 pounds. In deadlift you have to grip the weight and move it up. I think I can be fairly confident saying I don't have a weak wrist. I don't have a fursona, that's an avatar. What's a good grip strength? If I grabbed the scale and I pressed like so, what would be a good strength? Scallogs, I have 37 health rounds and at least all the farts begin to burn because of it. I think we have all the elements we need now, and we need to start programming this area. Let's do that. Let's do that. Let's do that. Let's do that. Oh, I see. How do you train wrist strength then? Like this? I'm pretty good at triceps pushdown and dumbbell curls. I do curls with 60 pounds each arm. Is ship an airship? Yes. I think my wrist is only in pain because I snapped on it weird. You do knuckles pushups for it? Yes. Let me see if I can do knuckles pushups with my wrist right now. One second. I'll do it on the hot metal floor here. Yeah, that's pretty easy. No, that's not a problem. Okay. It does hurt my knuckles though on the metal floor. Okay. Okay, so we need this to... I have plate smash remix. Close your hands into a fist and point them to the ground with your knuckles facing the floor. Yeah, like so, on the ground, right? That's what I did just now. Has it been made a hack like that where it's just a castle? I feel like that would mesh with the main liminal castle thing. Probably. The beta theme is so popular that I'm sure everything has been made at this point. Makihara. Makihara. Again, I don't believe that I have wrist strength issues. Though, I am not too enticed by these ideas. I do just be saying shit sometimes. Bro, you should write rap texts for Eminem. You'd be perfect. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't remember doing that. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't know what happens when you try to get it. Okay. No, I'm not familiar with guilty gear. Okay. Well, I wouldn't know what went wrong. Okay. You were saying that that was an illusion. Maybe I did remove it at some point. Maybe I put it in a different spot. Maybe it was an accident. I don't know. It's usually not doable. The words you're saying don't make any sense to me. Like a model that uses it so I can look at the map. Yeah, Eminem is old. Yeah, sorry. Unfortunately, I have to assume that what you're talking about is not a real technique. Otherwise, I wouldn't know about it. Because the words you're saying don't really make any sense right now to me. How many stars will this hack have? Probably around 200. It shows you cel-shaded visuals, flat colors. Well, we're not going to change the entire game to cel-shaded now. Oh yeah, we're 95% done. Okay, fuck it, let's change the entire art style. Well, if you have some models, I can still take a look at it and realize what technique you're talking about. Yep, the video would work too. That's it, Marty. Go back to the cave for another 9 months. We need the level cel-shaded. I don't know what I'm doing here. Dude, it must have been born. It must have been crazy to live in like 60 AD. Imagine being born like 30 years after Jesus died and then 20 years before Pompeii fucking exploded. You must be thinking like you're living in the end times. What? Hello, Sonic the Hedgehog. Okay, I was thinking of selling our magic cards. Is getting 60% of the value back a decent sale? Can you get 70 somewhere else if you have a bunch of cards that are like 5 bucks each? Tokyo Hotel in the background playlist? Do you know the culture around Tokyo Hotel? Are you saying this because you know Tokyo Hotel is popular and they're a German band? Or do you know the German culture around Tokyo Hotel? I don't know. I remember when third graders were like, Tokyo Hotel is gay. They even had an ad for them after Dragon Ball Z. Really? Ah dang Jones, that sucks. Yeah, I can tell. If you know RTL 2, then you for sure are a German and you would have known about it. Okay, what was this ad after watching a 3D coin issue on one of your clips? Oh. Okay, now I'm even more confused on how your technique could possibly relate to what I'm doing. But also curious about what it would mean. Do you like rap music? Yeah, sometimes. I'm pretty selective on rap music. I think there is a lot of really, really bad rap music. But there is also some good one. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Christmas was okay. I liked it. Well, if I don't understand what you're talking about, of course I have to discard it. But there is also a very good chance that what you're talking about is not even possible on N64. So that's my bigger worry right now. That you're presenting a technique that doesn't work on the N64. Okay. So the last thing is when I'm 6 o'clock and I can, we probably will change this eventually. I hope we will. I mean, I'm planning to. You know, miles. I don't know what that is. Try and make it in between of the two models, keep the corners but remove the centerpiece for just the plane and use normal maps. Okay I see. So you basically just get the roughness effect. Hello XPM. Try the corners instead of being more square and shift the plane to the center. Corners instead of being more square? Where the fuck do you see square corners? And pick the normal maps to play instead of when the big heavens makes me lose my care? What are you talking about? The things you're saying make no sense to me. I did not give him my doggy eye. He looks so goofy, look at him. I love my baby Yoshi. You won't get it if you read from here, okay fine. Since you seem to be very passionate about this, we will read your YouTube comments. Make it together too. Take the geometry from the 4d3d1 but simplify the center and remove the star. Then you could use quad UVs on the border of the coin alongside the geometry. Okay let me just be here so you get the visual. Okay so you move them all the way out, it's a perfect circle with a very simple shape. You could do a seam in the bottom that would cut the circle into a plane. Why would there be a seam at all? Circles are always in a plane. Then seam around the edges to make it one big plane. To set UVs since UVs are square, it wouldn't be any pixel whatsoever since the UVs would go in the direction of the image and the UVs would be straight so there wouldn't be any nozzle pattern during the real junctions. Okay so I think your comments are all over the place but I think what you mean to say is to arrange this texture in a way that we hit the sides of the texture and because now there is some distortion going on there will not be straight pixel lines like this anymore. Yes I know you're talking about UV seams but why would there be a UV seam here with your highpoly model? I don't have a highpoly model. Or actually well, I think I do now have a highpoly model. At first I didn't have one but now I have one. One second. Well I have this 3D model. I think I have one still of this, yes. Getting me wrong. The model you showed without normals. I have this model here. This is my 3D model that I generated the normal map from. Remove the star in the center. I'm gonna keep reading your comments first before I talk to you anymore, let's see this. So you then bake the star into it, that is in the normal map of course, it looks like an indent rather than it's going outwards in the model. I don't know if it's intentional or not but either way doing so you could keep part of the complex geometry and the vertical radius of the normal map without having to fake a detail. It's almost picture-decent. I don't know how that would be in hardware since you mentioned it's microcontroller in the game. The major point is for them to look as best as they can without lowering the framework too much. Don't remove it. I think if I understand you right though, what you want me to do is take my coin here, this one here, and you want me to basically move all the vertices outward like that, all the UVs, right, and then bake onto that so that there's more pixels and the diagonals disappear. I think that technique makes sense. Make the star PBR, make the rest 3D. Hmm. I can kind of see that working. He said no to that as well. I mean I think it's better to just go with this. Just say fuck it. Normal map from the high-quality model. I used techniques that are weird. What the fuck are you talking about? Y'all are just saying shit, you should be writing text for Eminem. Say no to PBR middle, rest 3D. I see. But I have a hard time to understand what the problem is, but what happens if you just enlarge one of the regular coins and make a different design on it? The regular coins are 2D billboards, it would just look very poopy. I think now we'll have a nice baby Yoshi. I think there's observatory as a hub, I just find it not very good. It is very straightforward compared to Mario 64's hub, so I can see a counterpoint to it, but the fantasy of just being on this space voyage is very poor. And I think it's very fitting in Mario Galaxy, and I don't think we should change it. I guess Hat in Time has a similar feeling. How many Lurker writers are enhancing their writing with the emodels already? Probably all of them. What is the name of the current song? I cannot. I could try, but I do not know these letters. Hello Pinkalice? Oh, it's the previous one you wanted? AM2R Ancient Power. Christmas was okay. Why can't you just use higher structure on the coin? Because that increases the cost of the coin proportionally. The coin is being rendered in real time, so if you double the resolution, the time goes from 40ms to 28ms, which means the game would not be playable anymore. And that's just doubling it. It doesn't even solve the issue. Probably, like, 40 stars for the second Bowser level. When buzzing from the first level, you should have resisted extra. Yeah. 80 to 100 will be a good number for the second Bowser level? How many to beat the game? Yeah, probably, like, 80. What qualifies as post-game content, is the question, before I can answer that. When you configure Yoshi in Edited? He has a bit of an attitude, no? Well, I guess we can... Let's get more... Get going! Now I should be able to talk to the baby Yoshi. So the idea is, the baby Yoshi is excited for you to jump in here and get going. But you don't know this until you are already on the ship. Once you're on the ship, a cutscene plays and the Yoshi just jumps on your head. And then in the lava you use him as a grappling hook. I did not make him intractable. Somehow? Oh. He needs this. Well, I don't think it's just that I have a higher standard for visual resolution. It's just that the type of crunchiness on this is so unlike the entire rest of the game. Like this gives you like crunchy polygons basically, right? Which you would usually not have. You would have a crunchy texture only. And here the cutscene would play and you'd get warped to the lava. So we do need to program that part still. But that's not gonna be bad at all. Okay, one issue I have right now is we have all these characters here. And we have Bozo's Airship Armada. But it's not really... You never really know what you're doing, right? You never really know why you're doing anything right now. After the first Bozo level all the Yoshis get saved and you're like here. But none of the Yoshis really tell you that you are supposed to go to the second Bozo level. Or why you are even going to the second Bozo level. You do because there's more Yoshis around that you still have to save. But how would you know that? You just see this level with a bunch of Yoshis and you never know. So I think we should have this area here be mostly void of Yoshis. Except for like a couple over here. And then the Yoshis spawn in later after you beat Bozo. You can't do that, Piccolos, because the texture is not symmetrical. No, Judy. That will not... So what if we removed most of the Yoshis here and had most of the Yoshis still talk about Bozo. And this Flying Ship Armada here. I don't think... Oh, this guy has a text. Oh, I haven't beaten Bozo yet, so none of the Yoshis are here. I forgot that's how it worked. Hello, Layra. I think we should make a note for that. Okay. Make all the Yoshis here talk about the remaining Yoshis and then Bozo's control. Make the three Yoshis here not spawn until after Bozo 2. Let's get this one. And then we should have that here as well. Maybe another one. Are you going to fix those spaghettis at some point? Yes, of course. But not before Biobank's rework. It's a waste of my time. No, you can't, Piccolos. That doubles the resolution and that doubles the cost. If you don't double the resolution from splitting it, then why are you splitting it? So this way we have a little more exposure to the story where it's like you want to go after Bozo. Maybe after the first Bozo level, Bozo should be like... Yeah, you freed maybe these Yoshis, but there's even more around. Fix the spaghetti. Okay. Okay. Actually, that would be an ideal place to cut into part one. Actually, we should just add more of this in general. Where am I working at the moment? Quiz 15. The title of the video. Okay, I think that's all we're doing for today. I have a beta tester coming over later today, so I want to be ready for that. Next time we are maybe going to do the Melon Invasion with the Shy Guys. We're probably going to finish part 9 for now. And then we can move on to part 10 even. Yeah, I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye!
