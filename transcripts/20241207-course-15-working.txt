Hello. Hello, Sully. Hello, Rick Luton. Bing bong. Hello, Fierce. Thank you, Layra. Layra! Did you end up making the bowser thing? I already moved on to one level beyond that, and it's already, like, pretty far along. I was waiting for that. Oops. Yo, thank you for the resub, Zayna. Why did I not hear that? Huh. What the fuck is this? The casino level from Sonic? No. You can see a little of Sonic levels. That's unfortunate. Mario Pinball, maybe? Is this the final level? Yes. As in the final main course. After that, there's still a couple side levels to do. Well, this is not meant to do that, but that's fine. Any OST wishes for today? Yeah, that's a good one. You glow so pretty. Well, this is going to be an arcade. We need a bunch of lights. OST wishes?  What are you nani-ing at? Is it going to be Pinball Mario? There's going to be Pinball, yes. But not Pinball Mario. Probably turned down my game sound a little bit. I think this made me worse. Pinball Luigi and Mario Galaxy, that's exactly what we're going for. I'm not sure on the metal pieces yet. These kind of don't look very good to me. Not that kind of arcade. The kind of arcade where you play games for points. I really like how the texture here has a bunch of small stars drawn. That was even intentional. Very cool looking. So I had a funny experience with a beta test for this level here. So two people played it. No, actually three people played it. And two of them had a good experience with it. But one person had a really miserable experience with it. And it's because they never thought to walk this way. They just didn't notice that there was a whole level here. So that's going to be interesting to figure out how to make it more likely that people realize there's a level. Because I feel like I do need to accommodate that somehow. Because it is very much intentional that the first time you are in this level you just walk this path down. So I definitely need to do something there. And I also need to make it less likely that people find the retro pipe. Which, you know, you're kind of guided to the retro pipe here. Because of this. Coin arrow. Coin arrows often work. But I'm not a big fan of it. I think there needs to be more than that. I think it also needs to be easier to get over this. Because what if you don't think to long jump here. And you don't see the side to the left. Which is what happened here. The person just did this. Yeah, signs like a bomb might work. I think that's why all the Mario 64 levels are designed the way they are. They have a very clear forward. That gets you through like 80% of the level. And it gets your foot in the door. So you feel like you know where to go next. And that's what we want to do. We want to make it very obvious where to go at first. Either way, we're actually working on the flipper pieces right now. In the asteroid arcade. We need a flipper piece that rotates and flings the ball back up. Oh, that's this piece here. A spherical bumper that pushes you in the direction you came from. That's this one here. Triangle pieces that bump you in the direction that it points at. That's this piece here. Metal pieces that you can just stand on. That's these pieces here, but I think they look bad. And a trampoline piece that just shoots you up. Kind of like a button spring type thing. That's this piece here. So next we'll be programming all of these. Just fix an issue I noticed in this level just now. While I was fucking around. So I'm thinking for this level we'll do. Instead of the bit pipe being here. The bit pipe needs to be somewhere else. That you can't access until later. And you see the bit pipe from here. So you're like, hmm, how do I get there? I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I wonder, I wonder. And then this needs to be easy to close. But that's for another day. This is what we want to work on today. I think this is ugly, this thing here. Doesn't work. Not a fan. Remember the red sphere in the sponsor seal? It's been replaced with this here. I think it's a lot better. I'm using this kind of, like I said, inspiration here. And this has so many cool lighting effects. And that's what I want for this level. Hello Mr. Clomet. I tried it back on top of the house. That changes nothing, because you can still instantly access it. It just makes it take longer. You have not understood the problem or the assignment. Dude, that ring. Oh my god, this ring here is so cool. I need that in the level. I don't know what it's going to do, but I need it in the level. I need that exact thing in the level. Just like, make it do whatever. We'll figure it out. Knife models. Thank you for my knife models. Knife compliment premium. Will it look better on an emulator? Yeah, probably. There's some stuff that's going to be looking better on N64 because of emulator bugs. That is unavailable, unfortunately. This kind of stuff. Okay, I need something that kind of gives me stabs here. Don't know what I'm going to do with this yet, but it's going to look very cool. It might literally just be a background piece. What's the ugly thing supposed to be? What ugly thing, Zeina? Oh, the thing I find ugly? This here. This is supposed to be... You know how there's like flipper machines and the ball flies through it? But there's also like some metal pieces that you can just bump against? That's what this is supposed to be. The metal piece and the flipper machine that you can just bump against. Maybe it's a bad idea to have metal pieces like that at all. Like, all together. And we need a different way to put platforms below the stage. The girders? Girder arcades. This is going to be fun. Ew. That's going to look really bad in 3D.  NASA engineer developing VR Donkey Kong. So glad that the guy is a NASA engineer. That is very much a requirement to make VR Donkey Kong. Because making games is so difficult. You need a NASA engineer. Oh no, I revealed the meat folder live on stream. Not the meat folder. Bloodshedding on a metal architecture? For a disco ball? Yes, we can do a disco ball. We have a disco ball in a different level. With basically that. And I'm not using the metal architecture because it's ugly. It's better than this. So there is one exact texture I have in mind that I want to use. But I don't think I'm going to find it. The news was having a bad day. Don't judge it for making NASA engineer develop a VR game. It does sound like a slow news day. This is fucked up. Who sent me a 65x65 texture? I would do something like that. I thought you said the meat folder. I did say the meat folder. Hello Ricardo. Hello DevilsValentine. Dude, we just finished the next video. It's 14 minutes long and it's a banger. I think this is the best video on my channel yet. I don't know how well it's going to do. But it goes hard. This is very close to the texture I was looking for. What's with the colors on this? I don't know. Who did this to you, bro? Hello Tanya. The release before Christmas, sure. I will release this together with the spirit of the Christmas past. Oh, this one could be a good texture. It kind of looks sick. Thinking back on it, I still think it's a good texture. It's incredible how good Gen 1 Pokemon is. For the time when it came out, video games were basically made to be terrible. And then they actually just made a good game. That's fucking insane. They were the first people that had the idea to make a good video game. Think about that. Super Mario Bros. 3 holds the title of the Super Mario Bros. Well, I can kind of see Super Mario Bros. 3, yeah. I can mirror this in a metaphor, can't I? I don't know. Although I reasonably turned this into an alpha channel without destroying everything. I think I need Photoshop for that. A peeking of Mario Bros. 3? What are we peeking about? Did you just song request this? Oh, I thought it was going to be Super Mario Bros. 3 masturbation. I'm damaged. I don't know if this is any good. How do you rotate an image in Photoshop? Oh, there we go. Shit, I need to rescale this first. There we go. How do you rotate text in MS Paint? I don't think it's possible. That's actually a really funny name for a 3DX3. Don't shame me so much, but I couldn't see a thing on YouTube. Damn, I had no idea. That sucks, if true. I don't know. What happened to the combiner? This is not what I had. The hell? Oh well. Fun fact. Make sure to not use the text in Combiner Cycle 2 at all, if you can avoid it. Because... Just don't do it, okay? That's it.             Looks cool, what can we do with it? I don't actually know. I didn't think about this too much. The idea is we'd have the light go around like this. Maybe even like this. So we can have an animated color change thing on this. Nice gay cock ring case, thank you. That's one or two. By the way, do you want to see this? Because I had two, three people play Course 3, just as a demo. And one of them recorded it. The recording is a little depressing to watch, because the person just went into Course 3, found the 8-bit pipe, couldn't beat the 8-bit pipe, struggled with it for 15 minutes, then gave up on the 8-bit pipe, went to the main course, spent like 10 minutes running around not finding anything except the gay hole, and then gave up on the game. They just got one star. There's clearly some issues here. I actually wrote down a bunch of issues with Course 3. Let me see. People find the bit pipe too easily. I think what we need to do is we need to make the bit pipe only visible at first, and you can't access it. The Mario World castle is too difficult. There's a bunch of jumps that are too difficult. The gap to the main area is... The person couldn't get across it. I know there's a way to just walk across it, but the person couldn't figure out how. They just jumped into the gap once and then gave up on it. So I think the overall conclusion is the player really needs to be guided to Star 1 a lot more. I think this is something they do in Mario 64 a lot, where they make it very obvious how to get to the first star, and then on the way to the first star you make a bunch of mental notes on what else there is to level and what you want to explore. So I think that's how we should handle it. I can smell your disgusting sausage breath from the first screen, Indian. Indian? Sausage? Curry? I'm not Indian. This is actually the second time this happened to me. Why are people being racist to me for being Indian? I'm not even Indian. The hell? Me, me. What nationality could I be to where you would not be racist towards me? Just give me a list before I reveal my nationality. All the Retropipers in the demo are too difficult, I think. You're probably the whitest person I know. That's not true. I have... My taste is actually very similar to what the taste of a stereotypical black man would be. I just talk like the whitest person you know. Just pop in a quick breath mint. But that's not going to change my nationality. What the hell? Okay, so if we make this darker, I think this will look banger. It looks like they lit the beacons to help Gondor. I don't get the reference. I've never been into a lot of the rings. Doesn't look like the whitest person. You know what? Fair enough. I am very pale. Unless Swift is the whitest person on Earth. I can see that, yeah. Oh, that looks cool. Why is the six minutes of the song? I don't want to listen to six minutes of the song. Is it just me or does the music sound so similar? Okay, that guy is being too weird now. At first it was funny, but now it's just cringe. I'm sorry. You need better material. Did anything important happen last stream? I missed it. Mostly 3D modeling. The ring looks cool, but it doesn't look as cool as the one in Mario Kart 8 here. Why is that? What does it do different? Is it because it's so much faster? Is it because it's a more limited range? I think it's the more limited range. That's it. We need less colors on this rainbow. I gazed at my felke's cult members. You're one of them. Nice. What's the quiz theme again? Retro Arcade. It's an arcade? No, it's not Retro Arcade. I'm sorry. Delete that. Protocol removed. It's not Retro Arcade. Hold me accountable for the things I said. This is going to be a space arcade. It's called Astro Arcade. It's an arcade. Anyone in chat want to have a stupid argument? I thought of this recently. A way to incite the most meaningless and stupid argument of all time. Anyone want to have it with me right now? I will take the opposite opinion whatever you say, because I have no opinion on this topic. Yes. Is magenta a real color? It's because I'm planning a MrBeast video that's going to be called I hacked every N64 game in one day. Matthew. It's going to be for April Fools. If you can see it, it's real. Yeah? Is that what makes it real? Yeah, that looks cool. Why shouldn't it be? Because there's no wavelength of light that corresponds to magenta. Magenta is just some of your icons activating on both ends of the electromagnetic spectrum, visible spectrum. So, there is no magenta photon, but there is the magenta color you can perceive. I've definitely heard people say it's not real before. So it's the same as brown. How's brown not real? Isn't brown just like a decent chunk of like red to yellow and a little bit of blue and green, but like really dark? There's no wavelength there? I don't believe you. How's there no brown wavelength? I mean, of course it's... Okay, I see what you mean. I'm thinking of orange as neon brown. You know what I mean? Might be a bad moment if I get out your colorblind while texturing that. Unfortunately not colorblind. Okay, back to this though. I think this looks like shit. Brown is like dark orange. It's desaturated dark orange. So there needs to be metal pieces here and oh my god, these are such nice metal pieces. And they're all glowy. Ah. I'm so glad we're discussing the important issues of the day today and not the fucking assassination of that higher up in the health society, health insurance thing. This is truly the discussion that should be happening today. Magenta being a real color and brown. I don't know, seeing brown is not a real color kind of feels like seeing extra white is not a real color. You know what I mean? It's like, yeah, I'm sure. Guess what CEOs? I mean, this is kind of a difficult discussion to have on stream because I don't want to be put on like a terrorist watch list. Okay. Yeah, so the metal chunks are difficult to do and I don't really see anything here directly that would look like the metal chunks. So maybe it's best to not have metal chunks like this. I'm also not sure what this is going to do. Is this just going to spin? Hmm. I think every single person, no matter the beliefs, has the same opinion and that's it. Yeah. What's the time summary name was supposed to be? I don't know. I saw it in the video and I thought it looked cool. I was like, I want this in my level. I don't know what it's doing yet, though. So I just added it and maybe hopefully we figure out the use for it later. Now we have it. Hehe. I think you should make the Mario Galaxy Space Jump themes dark when the parts come together. Eh? You know what, we should just program these things and then put a bunch of platforms down and then see what happens. I think that is the play. Let's do that. Let's put a bunch of platforms down and program these things, see what happens. I think that's the correct decision for now. I actually think that the guy dying right now, yeah, everyone's in agreement with it. But I think either the left or the right is going to co-opt it for them. And then the other side is going to be like, this is so bad. Look how evil the other side is, they want to kill people. It's going to get neutered politically. It's going to be appropriate to either side. And then suddenly it's no longer poor versus rich, it's left versus right again. Because the media is very good at doing that. And if they're not doing that, they really, really want to prevent the class war. It's going to happen. I'm putting all my money on it. I just don't know which side will have it now. Because you could be like, the left could be taking it and being like, actually only the left could be taking it. And actually the right could be taking it in a sense of like, look how evil the left is. Yeah, they will just go do that. It's clear. That's what's going to happen. Hello, Escu. Magenta is a rare color, by the way. Its wavelength is between purple and red. The wavelength between purple and red? That's the entire visible spectrum. What is the Rokka supposed to be for? Just aesthetics? The Rokka? What is a Rokka? What is a Rokka? The red pill, blue pill thing? From the Matrix? Or from the... Soy Jack cinematic universe? Which one are we talking about? Okay.  Everyone responding to this poll chooses between blue pill or red pill. If more than 50% of people choose blue pill, everyone lives. If not, red pills live and blue pills die. Which do you choose? This is a really stupid question, though. Because think about it. Yes, everyone could pick the blue pill. But why would anyone do that? Everyone could also just pick the red pill. If everyone picks the red pill, everyone lives. If everyone picks the blue pill, everyone lives. There's absolutely zero reason to pick the blue pill, except to just randomly... Try to die. Heh? You have to be really stupid to pick blue in here. Am I missing something? There will never be 100% of people picking red, so red means you kill people. That sounds like that person's decision. I mean, if you're that stupid, sure, you may die. It's your own decision. You know, there will never be 100% of people not playing in traffic. But we still need to drive our cars. Nah, bro, if you're playing in traffic, I can't save you. It is what it is, man. Please don't play in traffic, Biobak. That's when I restart this. I couldn't live picking red when people I know 100% be picking blue. Can't you, like, talk to them beforehand? And, like, tell them that, like, it's a really stupid idea to pick blue when, like, they could make everyone live by picking red? Seeing people below the IQ to pick red deserves to die. Which is probably immoral. Okay, but would you also say people playing in traffic deserve to die? Because, like, that's how we operate society right now. Everyone picks blue, everyone lives as well. Sure, but not everyone's gonna pick blue, right? That's much less likely than everyone picking red, I feel. Well, actually, not everyone's gonna pick blue. Yeah, I see what you mean. This is a little bit of a prisoner's dilemma. Hello, MarioLuigiSM. Yeah, that does make it a good question. I expected by calculation you would prefer blue, I think. Yeah, that makes sense. I feel like a lot of people would pick red just to be safe, though. I don't think a Twitter poll reflects the reality of what people would pick here. I don't think a Twitter poll reflects the reality of what people would pick here.  I guess it really depends on how much value you put on your own life compared to the lives of the people that will die. Say you are dreaming and you dream even somewhere earlier, you could wake up and you're exposed to the two of them and nothing will be the same as the matrix, don't know, wait. Very sure the same thing went here. Okay, but imagine if humanity had like a week of prep time leading up to this, then actually it doesn't matter. I guess it doesn't really matter. I would feel pretty safe picking blue as well. You would like to gamble, respectable. What's with these random Pokemon noises in this OST? I do not know why people like random 96, I mean that's a cool project but it's not the type of project I would play the game with, it's the type of project I would look at and be like wow that's kind of neat they did that. You know what I mean? 534. The sign model looks like shit doesn't it? I thought I did send it to you but I'll send it to you right now. One of the testers commented on a tool trying to like read the sign and it's like please don't read the sign, the sign is cringe. 500 range. Oh I still need the overworld by the way, I just realized you have never sent me the  overworld. Oh also unanimously, everyone that played the demo thought that the new controls and camera were great. That's really good, I'm really happy with that. Was there an anime level? The most anime you'll get is a screenshot of the Super Mario Super Show. You did send it to me? I might just be stupid then. I thought I just had a screenshot, nevermind I just got some I forgot. Okay I had a busy week, okay I have to like catch up on like a hundred hours of work. Open on stream let's get some impressions, alright stream. We are doing a demo release with just course one and it's going to have the Delfino Plaza in it, maybe with like eight red coins or something just to like flex. And this is going to be the overworld from the demo. That's an object oriented programming, it's not a paradigm or gimmick that went too far, definitely went way too far. So this is what the demo overworld would look like, very much an under construction type deal with this collision stuff going on here. I like the little starshine here, is that supposed to animate somehow maybe? I don't think so. And there will be a bunch of signs explaining the controls and options. So what's the look of the world I've selected by now? And the lighting looks very cool. I like this a lot. It's funny that the blender quadrant system is like in the model but also like down here. Like this you can probably see it better. Very, very cool. Yeah you don't need an emulator to play this. But a lot of people find emulators convenient. Hello, Sile. That's crazy that you think of Flowey when you hear Lavandia music. Is this one the remodel thing? It's the first demo? Yes, but you get the updated version of it. Please tell me that's the right variable name. Did you get the bumper thing? Yes, I made that just now. Why can't I not spell at all? Let's see, so we should have a little scale animation now. I actually think the green is kind of nice. Okay, it's more than a little scale animation. But there is a scale animation. Did you visit the university? Yes, I did. Yeah, this game does use the expansion pack. But it's really just out of convenience. Technically you could make this game without the expansion pack. You wouldn't lose much. Although you might lose emulator compatibility. Because if I didn't use the expansion pack I would probably use some more cursed magic. Which is what my next video is going to be about. We found a way to use an extra one megabyte in the N64. And it doesn't work on emulators. Wait. Does this work? I guess not. I guess I forgot this. Do you use the framebuffers and Z-Buffer in the separate banks in the expansion pack workspace? Yes. I actually have a really fucked up setup. Where the first framebuffer is at 8040. The second one is at 8070, my size of framebuffer. And the last one is at 8070. That way I have the memory segmented into like two chunks. And I can use the segment after the first framebuffer until the start of the second framebuffer. And the space from the third framebuffer to the end of memory. For like data. So I have a really fragmented memory but it's super fast. Where is the extra megabyte coming from? From the hidden ninth bit in the N64. I don't think the action stays here actually. We need this to play a sound. Actually, play sounds from the artworks. Actually from the artworks. Yeah, I can deploy them on virtual platforms now. Well, right now I just kinda only do stuff that works on both Emulator and N64. I kinda have to, except for like a few things. Okay, this bonked me correctly but it's obviously still getting way too big. Why is it doing that? Now it should just do nothing, right? Oh no, we scaled up by one. I got this completely wrong. I had to scale up by a factor of ten. No wonder. After this level, we still need three side-levels and the overworlds. I don't think there will be an anti-piracy screen but I think there will be a screen that's going like if you bought this game for money, you've been scammed. It's always shooting me this direction. I probably made a stupid mistake somewhere. Right, that will do it. I also think this is not in the forest. I want to go to 120 maybe. How the fuck are you supposed not to die here? I haven't thought about that yet. I don't know. Let me listen to the sound here. There is a sound but it's not very action-heavy. We definitely need to give the player a lot of air control after this so that they can realistically not die. It's fun though. I like it. Oh. Fair enough. I don't think sound action bonk is enough. It needs to be like the in-game sound. Invisible wall hit sounds. Why does it play the sound? I like sound action bonk. Which one is it? Sound action bonk, yeah. That's the one I want. It's... what? It was all sound as negative sound. Yeah, I know what you mean. Maybe we need like a completely new sound for this. I don't know.  I mean, this is course 15 so we can do stuff that's a little bit more difficult. Someone else have another OST they wanted to listen to earlier. Basically anything but this. Made you 0.01 from this wonderful ad that ended up being our last sentence. Oh, it's actually less than one cent. It's like not even a third of it. Oh my god, what's with the ads? I'm so sad about that. That sucks. This piece of shit OST, dude. Did they make this terrible on purpose? What's this? Relaxing video game music in a cozy room, Nintendo 64. That's what we'll listen to. I don't know what this is. Yeah, we do use the yiha sound effect, funnily enough. I don't know what this is. So now I made it so that you get some air control here. Should probably be a little more air control than that. And I think maybe it should always change Mario's action speed, because I don't like that it's like a random thing here. I think the trick to making this work is to make this a little more rigid. You can probably also screw with the normal a little bit and make it always point up a little bit. This could lead to like insane speedrun tech. Okay wait, think about this. Wait, I have an insane idea. Come on. I mean even something less insane like. What the fuck? This feels very controllable to me, but I'm also the guy that programmed it so that doesn't mean too much. This runs a bit too much considering the dark background. Yeah I can kinda see it. I can probably turn it down. Let me see if I have controls for that. Intensity I do have intensity flag here. I did think about this. I hope it works. Alright let's fudge the normals a little bit. Does this mean I don't zero in on presses? Nope. I don't know what's the number one exponent of Neomza. Ro, you made a whole game about that didn't you? So now when I jump into it from the side. Yeah okay that makes it a lot easier. Because now you always get shot mostly up. Now the animation. I'm not sure the animation is snappy enough. I think the animation might need to be a little bit faster. So. A little more extreme. I mean, I can see that that could happen. Yeah, but ideally you would be like, you know, jumping on top of it or something. Or like behind it. Is the course theme for this stage the same as Act 2 in the Scuttleback Hack? Act 2 in the Scuttleback Hack wasn't actually secretly me already working on Course 15. I wouldn't have submitted to the comp if I wasn't already doing something that was going to contribute to my hack here. So really I just used the comp to double dip there. Can I have all these elements in the shape of an actual pinball machine? No! Not this again. Biobak. If there's one lesson that I've had to learn from all my romhacks up to 2024 is do not arrange flipper pieces into a pinball machine. You have a cat? That's so cool. The Ocarina of Time title theme in this? If not, then yes, the background music was literally playing the Ocarina of Time title music. Let's listen to the Space Arcade song for a little longer. No fall damage, honestly. Yes, I agree. Oh, it's on Snowbent Bounce. I like that one. That's what I should be playing. How's this not turning off fall damage? Nevermind, I guess. Oh, here and here it's turning off fall damage. There we go. Anyone receive media files for these unused sound effects? I'm going to play them on my flute. You'd have to ask Badub, but I'm sure he's up for it. I'm glad you like that one. One of the biggest pinballs was the new Icelandic Grunt, which is about to evolve to pinball and have the eventually reach the bottom of the die problem. Yeah, but honestly, I think the idea of just putting them under the main stage and then use the pinball machines to climb around under the stage is so cool. You know that Mario Sunshine stage where you climb under the town to get into the town sneakily? That's such a cool fantasy and I kind of want that. Alright, let's do the next thing, which is let's do this part here. So what this is going to do is if you step on it, it's just going to shoot you upwards like a trampoline. Well, actually, this should probably always do this so that they don't get caught by surprise. Yeah, the texel density is fucked up, I agree. I know what I did wrong. I know I shouldn't have done it. I know it was a sin. I did it anyway. I think one way to make the pad feel better is to lower the collision. I don't understand. Could you elaborate on what any of those words mean? You mean the pad that bounces you up? Hello servers. Yeah, I guess you're right. It's kind of not really a circle, but rather an oval. I guess that could be improved, but I don't think it's that important right now. Oh, you mean visually move it down when it hits Mario? I don't think so. I don't think that's the play. It's not a matter of allow. It's a matter of having the conditions accurately represent what's going on. What's going to happen? You know, we should make the button to like the velocity here. This one is very important and it's always visible because it's not visible. There's going to be a visual hole in the level geometry. There's no way this is exactly 534, which is already the number I have written down here. But it seems to be. Helm's readability, but wouldn't that be less accurate then? Because like I measured it out. Actually, well, I guess the pop is not quite as much. So yeah, maybe slightly reducing it is fine. It's weird. What's not having a guy machine sell you fall protection bubbles for coins that are in damage for one fall? It's the arcade vibe that helps you not die in the star. And that's an uncomfortable for character interaction component to this. And it also it's like inventory to this, which is very not Mario. What I would like better, I think was if you could like open the thing and it gives you like a wall protection for like a little bit. Like something that just attaches to Mario's model. Or we could this is I think maybe more reasonable if we really thought this was too difficult, but we could do is make it so when you fall instead of dying, you just get put in a bubble and go back and lose to health or something like that. My styrofoam looks better than Yoshi's Crafted World. That is kind of insane because my styrofoam looks really bad. But already the way falling works. Are you talking about fall damage rather than falling into the death skywalks below? Which falling are we talking about here? I have not seen Joe Mario. Is this some kind of Ligma? I thought you are put you back on solid ground or removed health. It does not. Which can even fall into that. I mean, maybe it really should because falling into the skywalks is brutal. But no, it does not. It does that only in Course 11. The Oily Boily Bay. It doesn't do that like the arcade section in Course 7 or in Course 14. Entry true in the tree too. It does it in some levels. Yeah. Now that I mentioned it, that is a mechanic I very commonly add to the levels. But yeah, it doesn't. I was not planning to do it here, but maybe it really should. It's weird to think it doesn't behave like that. True, but in the bird course, you specifically have to talk to birds to get them as like a save point. And in Course 11, it's not like infinite void. It's like the oil. There is already meal jams all over the place. I don't need to get any. But yeah, in Course 3, for example, if you fall down, you just die. Which, you know, that happened to one of the testers. There's also the Cloud Camp level where a cloud captures you. So there's three levels where falling down, you get saved. But it's not always happening. Maybe it just wasn't funny. You just said Joe Mama, how's that a joke? Looks like a punchline. It's still weird that it's only explained sometimes, but it only happens sometimes. So maybe we should think about explaining this in other levels with prominence backgrounds like this. I mean in the space level, being put in a bubble kind of makes sense because speed is weird and funky like that. In other levels, I don't think there's a prominent death floor. Well, there's the wing cap level still. There's also the bomb cap level. You can die pretty easily in those two. By the way, I had someone play the bomb cap level. It was a casual player and they made it through pretty easily, which is good. Do all this magic and bounces you back. I mean, it doesn't kill you if you swim in it. It just kind of poisons you and damages you. I think that's fair enough. Does it make sense when it's meant that you never know when you're in a level with void protection and you actually fall down? Yes. Well, I don't think the player should expect void protection. Think they should just be happy when there is one just like oh shit I got this even though I was totally not banking on this at all. Um okay this is what's a good velocity to use here wait we don't want this to stop at all we want we want this to happen I feel like I forgot something but I don't know what I forgot set the B param for here to something more reasonable yeah I mean you have a fair point it's just at this point how do we fix this I don't think it's a big issue but like how would you even fix it at this point okay it looks horribly offset but that's because of 64-bit that's an issue okay interesting oh I see why can't have it be so much in between the collision being outside on plus 64 really is quite disruptive to development it bursts the still oh I didn't think it would interesting um I forgot to set a velocity on Mario that's probably why if they make every level of white production even takes happy all the way or you make tail which do and which don't sounds a little hard to me it's just confusing for the player yes but then like we have to remove the birds basically so I don't like that we would have to remove the birds you can keep them but they will just set you back whenever they activate so that's not good what we could also do is add like an item or something then we place down and then when you step on it and like saves your location so that if you fall into the void you just spawn back on there one hot sharky that sounds like a good idea right now so if there was a path specifically marked to give you white protection I think that would make it better maybe no half is not a very valuable resource I would still feel bad I think he's kind of suck to jump on yeah these are nice no Yoshi just dropped the book what is the book wait it's the collision offset even though I applied all transforms it is you see this let me read what the book is am I stupid an officially licensed model of Marshall with an attached waterproof picture oh a picture book yeah so this fast 64 bug actually makes it so that we can't export the level correctly because in ss geotranslate rotate nodes that kind of ruins everything that actually really really sucks is that fix it maybe no that didn't fix it and actually get set to wrong values again afterwards pick an earring collect points go fast kill enemies okay I can't fix fast 64 bug but I can move on to the next thing on the list which is this here I think doing animation like this works for this like that it looks like it's moving forward which I like you know what pisses me off the most about talking to people in Canada they always say hello how are you and it's like why the fuck do you need to know that stop interrogating me we literally just met can you just not say hello like a normal person you know that feeling you just meet someone and they already want to know how you are socially acceptable I mean it shouldn't be socially acceptable for them to ask me such I think the easiest way to program this would be if Mario was unable to touch the bottom thing here actually that would be a lot easier for me since it is 45 degrees rotated you can't really touch it so yeah we'll do that yeah you actually care how you are and they want you to say good because the way the social interaction goes I know and then I have to ask back I can't dude I really don't want to know how you are that's a way to intimate a question for did you just meeting you the hell I don't want to be a therapist I just want to say hello and get the show on with I get asked that by people who messaged me for the first time on discord hello how is your current mental state did I do this right I did cool that was not intentional so I scripted a 20-minute video that's just talking about the Nintendo 64's cache instruction and there's cool shit in there like what I would call quantum data and I wonder if people will watch the video because I get people watch that that I'm convinced I can talk about anything on YouTube and it will do well and if they don't watch it I'm gonna be very sad so there is a way where like instead of using REM you can use cache directly with some tricks and that's the idea nice Zainab what do you need to do for the game to be done?  hello nice can you put it down? it's too hot to touch it's not, it's warm no bye Zainab everyone say bye Zainab she's picking up the baby love you too 16 now protein soup I mean there's milk in there and milk has a lot of protein hello anyone know where you can watch a proper old Dragon Ball Z first airing with old filler and like the German dub someone just randomly knows that maybe yes I kind of want to is 16 the right offset? because someone does Yahoo video piracy guide that seems illegal to me I will not click on that link because that seems illegal hello tea time oh okay thank you for warning me I'll make sure not to click on it if someone suggests that they are clearly a criminal show me whatever eat I want this is some good hot choccy the most christmasy thing of all time is not christmas trees it is hot choccy nothing? is he in a test room? maybe I think he's only in the first test room and not in the third one maybe if you pay attention you can see him yep we're working on all the platforming assets for this level I forgot to make the solid that explains why it wasn't solid no test goomba this is the overworld with the test goomba okay so it works and it does what I programmed it to do but it doesn't feel like the right direction because of gravity So I think we need to give it some bias upwards. And I'm choosing the square root of 2. No Christmas egg now. I'm too busy. Yeah, that fits like a 45 degree angle, even though it really isn't. I feel like that's a sentence that hasn't been spoken before. It looks good too, like it feels nice the way it just bones me. Yeah, that's nice. And very much feels like being in a flipper machine too. I think this is pretty nice. You know what I forgot? The star. I was thinking of making the star blink. What do you think? Should we make the star blink? Yes or no? The star in the middle. It would go from black to yellow, over and over. Yes. I'm not sure if it's good, because it doesn't feel like it's glowing, you know what I mean? There's so many momentum shenanigans here. Oh my god, this level's gonna go crazy. I'll just make it brighter when you jump on it. Yeah, that might be a good idea. I could have it be unlit while you're not jumping on it, and then as soon as you jump on it, it just goes bright. I think that's this idea. So the idea would be this is what it normally looks like, and when you jump on it, it's that, and goes back to black. I don't know if that's the idea. I don't know, it doesn't look very glowy, and when it's dark, it doesn't look very inviting to hit. Kind of a tough call. Maybe I should buy the bullet and say, fuck it, it's gonna be 2 second material. You have an idea for this buyback? Something better than what I just outlined? Because then I'll just let you decide on how this should blink, and I will implement that. That sounds good to me. Then there's Flipper Beast. This Flipper Beast doesn't fit in with the visuals at all. Man. Alright, sounds good. Hmm. Can I save to some- Actually, it looks fine in-game, it just looks stupid here. I think it's fine. Hmm. Pokemon Snap 64 is such a banger. I wish the Pokemon Snapping Monk was just as good. Oh my god, dude. That would have been so cool. Pokemon Snap is one of my favorite games of all time, for sure. It might actually be in, like, my top 5. You know what I really underappreciate Pokemon is? Onix. I wish Steenix was in Gen 1, then you could evolve it, or, like, level up. Onix would be so cool. What about the New Pokemon Snap game? They made a thing where, like, you have to get 4 different scores on every Pokemon. So kind of, like, you have to play all the levels 4 times, and I really don't like it. That really ruins it for me. It, like, takes the vibe of, like, trying to improve your scores away from me. Is this Pokemon Additive No Blending Billboards on the N64? Yes! Um, the way this one's gonna work is, it will usually look like this, and, like, blink maybe? Very much inspired by Walrus Pinball here. If you look at the flippers here, they can have, like, electricity going along, but I don't think I want the electricity. And the problem with Additive Glow is that it doesn't clamp, so it's very easy to peek and, like, wrap around to zero. But what you could do instead is, like... What's a good way to describe it? Instead of additive, it's, like, approaching asymptotically. So, 8 Puzzle Lights at the same time. I think normally there's only 7 lights, but with X3 you can have 9. But obviously that won't work on emulator. I really don't need 24 Triangles on this. At least I don't get the feeling I do. Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo   For our next year, I work with Cryzen to make Mario 64 and Unreal Engine real, like we just port the Render96 models, we port all the animations, because I know exactly how to do it, and then we get 2 million views, and 15 thousand dollars on Patreon, and then, this is a very important step, after we get like a million views and all the Patreons, we have to make sure we get shut down by Nintendo, because we don't want to finish that project, so like I need an excuse, so like I'll have to be like really annoying and like I have to report myself to Nintendo, hoping I get shut down, so I don't have to finish the game. I need to like ask people to tell Nintendo about me, I have to like really sell it, maybe like, I'm sure there's things we can do. You think I might get hired by Nintendo, I hope so. Just pretend you get sued, oh you're right, I don't even need to get shut down, I can just say it, and then if I get exposed, like someone tells people that Nintendo didn't actually shut me down, I can say it was a copyright troll, because there is already copyright trolls with Nintendo, dude this plan is airtight, genuinely this is like a $100,000 idea, if I was like 20% of a worse person, oh my god, dude, that would be a lenious Mega Nintendo FPGA crowdfunding scheme, has this been done before? My uncle heard your idea, is that a bad thing, does your uncle work for Nintendo? Can you ask him to shut me down after I made a million dollars? It's not just abusing GoFundMe alright, the idea is a lot smarter than that, it's also I don't like to talk to a girl, okay, I have another controversial hot topic, I don't know what to think here, when you play Among Us with your friends, you're supposed to lie to them, that's like the whole game, the whole game is you lying to people, and it's not morally reprehensible, while usually lying and deceiving other people would be morally reprehensible. Same thing with meme coins, when you scam people with like a meme crypto coin, that's not morally reprehensible, they're completely expected, that it's literally just part of the game, everyone that bought the meme coin bought it in hopes that there would be a big idiot that buys it after them so that they can make money off of it, so I don't feel bad for anyone involved. And the proof for this is in the little kid that did $30,000 by rug pulling people, he made one coin, rug pulled it immediately, flipped everyone off of camera, then made another coin, said sorry, and rug pulled everyone, and then he made a third coin, and this third made more money than the second coin, where he also rug pulled everyone. This proves to me that everyone investing in meme coins already knows that they're getting rug pulled and they do it anyway because they hope that they get out before the rug pull. It's the game bro, you're not mad that the game was played, you're mad you played the game and you lost. The coin got valuable because he did that, the coin would not have been valuable had he not done that, keep that in mind. Do we render the infpg on everything? Oh no, please tell me we don't, let me fix that real quick, dude if I made a meme crypto coin I would say from the get-go I'm making this only to rug pull you guys, and then I'm gonna rug pull everyone, and then no one can complain, and I feel like people would invest in it anyway. There was one more piece, wasn't there? Bouncer? Bumper? That's the one I have, what is bumper? Oh god, we're not using that, nevermind I think that's all the pieces. The thing of CEO killer, can't say on stream. Do you think I would be able to do that if I bought 51% of the stock? Do you literally just become the company at that point? Is it like some Satokaiba shit? Could I literally buy 51% of Nintendo and be like, give the copyright of Mario to Sega, and then be like, alright, let's sell my stocks again. Wouldn't that be insider trading at that point, because I know something the others don't? This is weird. You become part of the building? Fair enough. I think that was 47. What even is this stock tier? Why is this here? Some ass vanilla game. People still talk about Japan like it's an ideal society. People love Japan. Yo, it's Pokemon Sanada. What the hell? How's this possible? Am I insane? Goddamn, I'll finish in this stream. Wait, what the fuck? DNS start minus one? Oh, I see. That is a crazy way to program that. I'm not sure what I'm going to do for the release trailer yet, CreamTemo. With the release trailer, I want to be very careful, because I feel like Nintendo is going to try to take that down. So I really, really need to make sure it's fair use, which I'm not sure how to do yet. Okay, this looks nice. But it's not quite like I want it to be. Wanted to look a to not to a to f e2 holy shit that's very bright I would never make a trailer for free for myself what's the point why would I bury my normal video in like 15 other videos think about that I would just reduce my audience be crazy I need to be able to rotate these any way I want so I need the difference on the forward axis when you're afraid of never striking us they only strike my youtube videos they never strike my hex and yes I do have to work around that one that was crazy when you write a job that HR nobody you having issues with Nintendo we don't have an HR gears I think and yes they do it know about my channel but sharing you've got not to buy it that's already ready to release the just to fuck up your search results that's sure tea time so now we want to make it so that the further out on the thing you are and higher Mario's angle is going to be right so at this point we would like it to almost forward and at the point here we would like it to be like 45 degrees basically so let's think about this so moving pitch equals what's the pitch here when it's forward it's like a pitch of zero and then four zero zero is almost on what so like three eight zero zero and then all the way back it's like C zero zero like that maybe it's mostly right well when I release our team I I hope there's no other Nintendo release going on it's a think reduces the risk of being shut down what is stochastic processes what did you miss um you got married and had a child I don't know okay this is also a funny question I saw on the internet imagine this there is scientists that have set up a house and in this house two boxes one opaque one you can't see into this and one clear one then they scan your brain and fuck I'm explaining this poorly the opaque box has either a million dollars in it or zero dollars while the transparent box has a thousand dollars in it and before they invite you they scan your brain and they're going to ask you a question do you want just your paid box or do you want both boxes and they scan your brain and figure out what the answer would be and if you say you want both boxes they put no money in the box but if you say you want just one box they put a million dollars in the opaque box and now they invite you and what do you do you take both boxes or just one it's like you're already in there the money is already decided the fuck am I gonna do with a 1k yeah but like you're already there you might as well pick up the 1k as well right like why wouldn't you I'm supposed to be the incentive to make only pick one box in the setup well they scanned your brain beforehand and if they predicted that you would only take the box then you get like a million dollars but if they predict you take both boxes you get nothing well you really got me there and good job guys but doesn't it feel kind of irrational that you decide to pick less money even though you could pick more this alarm is weird because it's a shift I think it needs to be zero to this to be functional correctly I'm using the app for picking the box they scanned your brain and knew you'd have it so there's no point to trick them yeah but it is kind of fun that it feels so irrational to like not change your mind at that point because it predetermined at that point you you're a great team up gentlemen if you change your mind you're actually doing what they determined to do yeah still feel so rational what's the square root of a thousand like 30 yes it is for like 30 you I already tried to change it to be the L1 pro and it sucked actually did I maybe I just try L1 Oh just anymore mm Oh No, that's Yeah Man a lot of AI now is just make the model bigger and more expensive It's not like look we came up with a cool new invention. I Think I don't actually know if that's true But it's a bit lame if you ask me Mm This shouldn't barely move up and hopefully move backwards This is not quite good Now that I think about it See range actually so big or is the actual range. I want just three eight zeros It's about to sit there the bottom. I want to shoot there so that's Like four eight zero zero difference Are you scared of fat Larry? Very How do you know a fat Larry Oh only $200 a month Wow, it's so cheap. I have no idea If it's $200 a month surely and they need like two nuclear factories to like run the thing And a sonic the Hedgehog I'm sure you had a very good day today I Don't open the I was um, yeah, it was fun perfect until they realized they could make it perfect I Don't know if I would say they'd make that for morons Because what if you actually have like a way? To like monetize AI and you make Mac with $4,000 a month from that. You wouldn't be a moron to buy it You And so I was coming to where you're calling fat oh Yeah, there was a guy called fat Larry commenting on my video and he's like hello. I'm unofficially I'm an official representative from Nintendo. Please take this down. We will be suing you and his name was fat Larry Found it was very humorous  No, I think that's just a random YouTube comment me overthinking it No in You know when my small business but I have no idea what to call it and you just call it like your real name I think that makes a lot of things easier. I Know in Canada if you name your small business like your your actual legal name Then there's a few things where you don't need to register it So that's very very useful When a cool nice name for the business I see The old Nathaniel Bandy Welcome to the stream. We're working on course 15, which is a space arcade and we have a flipper machine kind of I'm working on the flipper parts right now Saw you smash the video the other day Yeah, the flipper piece mostly works, but it's not rotating far enough I Imagine I can't possibly fathom the misery you went through trying to 100% brawl. I Was thinking of maybe 100% in brawl one day, but I have yet to do it I Was doing like one or two classic modes a day and I can't be more than that. I Don't recommend it I mentioned You Wanted to send an ultimate how much work is 100% in ultimate though compared to like brawl or melee If you enjoyed it then it can't be that bad because I know for a fact no one enjoys 100% in brawl Mostly just world of light Ultimate is not as bad. Gotcha I have different taste in you. Do you know what you have to do to 100% brawl Skyloft? Oh Okay, that's like a good distance almost I Don't like how Donald shoots when I do that Maybe something this is more appropriate. I Remember playing world of light and like I just pick endorphin they have smashed everyone once and then like I want everything And then I decided not to play world of light And This should be a way to find this direction, unfortunately Now I forgot a zero here I'm actually really looking forward to the next smash game being a smaller game Because I prefer smash games from those characters Who that looks good, yeah, I like that That is fun I Guess you want to see the sickest speedrun tech with these flipper pieces ever You can do that or you can want something like that I'm sure you can like speedkick out of that too I Think Back to the roots, make it simpler. Remove side-Bs. I know that one's a hot tag. I prefer the game without side-Bs. I think the beauty in competitive games is to get complex interactions out of simple rules. And every move you add, and every character you add, adds more rules to the game. Then you have to learn to effectively engage with the game. And by removing moves like that, and removing characters, you make the game simpler without meaningfully reducing the complexity of the interactions. That's why games like chess are so popular. Because they're very complex with very few rules. Dude, it's like it doesn't matter what I do here. It just... Oh, it's because of the angle of our pitch. That's why. This is inertia. Honestly, there's literally nothing I can do. Except maybe reduce the angle of our pitch. Now that I think about it. You swipe combos when you're fighting a guy, it won't have the same combat as, uh... How's it called? Pokemon Go. We just tap the screen to fight. There we go. That scales nicely. I think we have our flipper pieces. When the direction of the gravity changes? No. But the strength of the gravity, we wanna change that. I do have a different level already where the direction of the gravity changes. And the way I programmed it, I made it so that it's all done by our graphics. So that I wouldn't have to change anything in the engine to support the full gravity change thing. And I don't really wanna add that to another level. You're probably thinking of the casino. This is an arcade, which is very very similar to a casino. And also it's the moon and the sun going on here. Will there be a bonus stream next week? I don't know yet. The bonus streams happen when I feel like it. Yeah, I'm pretty happy with these. The only thing I don't like is the metal pieces here. They look really really bad. We need to design some kind of platform design that we can just spam all over the level. There's going to be fields in here that have reduced gravity. So there will be some gravity shittin' in the guns. It's like a space that we kept high on time. Oh, I see. The volcano level. I think that's 8-3, not 8-2. Yeah, I guess this is the sum of all of those levels. Hey, it's my ball tubes. You have ball tubes? Where? What? What are you talking about? Ball tubes. I can't tell if this is some kind of joke. Or if there's ball tubes that I forgot about. That would make this level very nice. Oh, you don't want to do a little ball tube? That would be fun. What's after that? Maybe Twitch filtered the sounds? Because I only saw a message that says you don't want to do a little ball tube. I hope that would be fun. This level changed a lot since the demo, yes. Everything about this changed. The entire textures and the light and this whole area here. I love this. It does look a lot better in the demo, but I think we can still improve this a lot. Something about this feels not very yummy to me. It looks fine on the surface, there's nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't pop. The mouse animations are also so much better now. We also need to think about that this is the stupidest thing ever. We need to think about removing the slur from this text box. Because some people are reading this as a slur. Which it really is not meant to be. It's like nipping, as in biting someone slightly. They're called nippers? I feel like if that was a slur, Nintendo wouldn't have called them that. But people have read that as a slur in the demo. Oh, is this a slur? I don't know. But that was a complaint I made.    I've gotten more than once. Let me see Biobak's concept here, as soon as he has it done. Maybe add a Minecraft platform? How does that remove the slur from the text box? Okay. Either way, the flipper is good. I'll work on the design for these platforms while I wait for that. What a ball tube platform. I think this one has pretty nice platforms. God, I wish this game was good. Yeah, the green is kinda nice. But that would look a lot more like 64 and 8-2. The carpet is just kinda nice. Maybe we should go with carpet and tiles. I know this song. Wait, don't tell me what it is. Okay, nevermind, you can tell me. Oh, it's Mario Party. I know this song. I know this song. I wish they still made Mario Party as unfair as the first Nintendo game, I swear. Bowser being cruel to you is the best. The bosses had controls? This sounds like a problem to me. This is kind of embarrassing in a weird way.    Basically this with a coin inside. And you're the ball? How does this work? What happens to Mario? Does this kind of make this look even more like Sonic? I don't want people to say this is Sonic. What's happening? Or is this like a slide? Mario rolls inside. It's going to be Sonic! I can't! No! I don't want people to say you copied Sonic. It's already Sonic? No! We're going to make it not Sonic. I think that was Mario Pit Land. No one is going to think of it as Mario Pit Land. You're riding your Nibi with Nsync Digerism. That's not a Sonic thing. That wasn't Tony Hawk's Pro Skater first. I'll check about tiles like this in Mario Galaxy. If you have the text, you can send it to me. In Tony Hawk Pro Skater... You're lying! No, but unironically I think I don't like that vision for Mario. I think that's too far away from what we want to do here. We don't need any more Sonic accusations, you know what I mean? We already have some. That looks bad. I think this could work if we fix the texture a little bit. That's fine. It's very different from copying the entire gameplay. I want this to be more Mario Galaxy than Sonic. It's funny that there's an M in this title. I would have never known this. The Arcade Carbon, Red Carbon 2001, that's not even funny. Oh right! The Arcade Carpet! I completely forgot about that. You're absolutely right. It's not seamless, but we'll take it. It's a JPEG. There's no pattern here. I think I have to go with this. Alright, where's the pattern? The middle of the Z. That's a big one. Is it really that big a pattern? Am I in a new engine? I'm in Mario 64! My engine is a Mario 64 type engine. I'm in a Mario 64 type engine. Okay, I'm in Photoshop at the same time. They do some things differently. There's some things I can't do in GIMP, but I can do in Photoshop and vice versa. The pattern is too small. This is Blender. I'm making my level in Blender and then I'm rendering it in my own M64 engine here, which lets me play the game. This looks pretty cool. We just need something that's easier to tile. We could also just make one ourselves, honestly. This seems easy enough to do ourselves. That is kind of cool, though. I do like this. It looks very fun. With the free hour, this looks easy at the moment. Yeah, we all know what's coming. Of course, we can't have this. How does... Okay, right. Carpets and suns. These carpets are so cool. GenGBD is not going to be able to make a decent texture here. This is a really cool carpet. They also have these tiles here. How complete it is depends entirely on how you define completion. That's a good argument to be made. It's like 90% or even more. You could draw some potions, like star flower, mushroom, etc. Yeah, the rum is 90%. Actually, it's not. Actually, it's like 91%. But we have all the MPs imported now, so we have enough room space for sure. I think this is kind of a cool look for it, and we might be going for this. Well, I can't make physical cartridges because Nintendo will literally murder me and take everything I own. Unless I move to China, then I could probably do it. This looks so prestigious. Now that they do own the right to Mario. This is so cool. It's also tile-able. Okay, you know what? I'm actually going to do that. That sounds like a literally insane idea, but I'm going to put this here. Oh, this one? Yeah. But honestly, I like the idea with the power-ups being on the carpet, so that's probably what we're doing instead of that one. But for today, I think we've done enough. And I will see you guys in the next stream, whenever that may be. I don't actually know yet. Might be Tuesday. Might also not be Tuesday. So, until then. Bye-bye.
