Hello. Hello, Steven Steven. Hello, Rafael. We are doing some Mario. Hello, Don. Hello, X-Links. I did a lot of work on this stage off-stream this week. Do you guys remember this stage? This feels so ancient to me. What the fuck?      What the fuck? Hello, Selton. And what's the first thing she did in Canada? Really? That's off-timeline. No. The game is completely different. Okay, we need to get in here. And it seems to work. Nice. Gifted 5 memberships? Thank you for the 5 memberships. I don't know how much money that is. But I am grateful for that. Thank you very much. JustMuchVivaSans here. So blurry. Amazing effort to put in all of these videos. I am glad you like it. I've been putting in a lot of work and I'm making more videos recently. Because I need to make more videos. Because I need to feed my family. It sounds so depressing. But it is what it is. How do you like my meme? Limitation, breadth, creativity. Loads of it. It's a solid 4 out of 10. Might get you an exhale through the nose. One sharp nose exhale. That's all I need for the meme. Thank you. I'm only going to watch it passively. That is fine as long as you watch it. I'm only going to watch it passively.  I'm only going to watch it passively. I'm only going to watch it passively. I'm only going to reach out to people. Right now I have this form. Google form. Beta test application. This form here. If you guys want to beta test, you can fill it out. And I might take you in as a tester. But there's no guarantee. Okay. Can't outcode the Finansamt. It's not even the problem. The problem is that I have no way to communicate with the Finansamt. And I have no idea what they want from me. And actually they never message me. Which is another weird thing. I have like a tax advisor. And the tax advisor does it all. And I paid him a lot of money to do it all. But something was wrong. And he said he fixed it. But I don't know what the situation is. Because the guy doesn't write me back. So now I am in this fucked up situation. Where I think I did everything right. But I have no proof for it. And there's no way for me to find out. Because how the fuck am I supposed to see what they write me. Because I don't have an account with the Finansamt. My tax guy has it.  Just call him. I literally cannot call him. He is in Germany. I don't have a phone. And it's very expensive to call. Thank you for the five dollars, James. The thing is I paid them. But I am not 100% certain that they know I paid them. And also the Finansamt still has to send me back like four thousand dollars. Because I paid them too much. My microphone seems to be cutting in and out. I can pull it a little closer. Maybe this does it better.  I really wish I had looked into taxes myself. While I was still living in Germany. But at the time I thought The guy can probably do a better job anyway. My parents kept telling me Hire a tax accountant. He is going to do such a good job That you are going to end up Saving the money you pay him in taxes anyway. Of course now that I live in Canada And I did my own taxes And I didn't listen to my parents I know that that's all completely wrong. So yeah. I should have just informed myself. Instead of paying some professional To do it for me. I mean I am probably able to create it In peace technically, legally speaking. But I don't know.  Any OST wishes for today? Let's give this a little bit of a blue tinge.  I think Biobak also finished course 2. So we'll see how that goes. Maori Bros 1 OST, let's see that. There is no deadline on it. I'll just pull whoever applies. Basically. I might make a proper video Announcing that I need beta testers at some point. If I run out of testers. But until then, you guys get first dibs. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say until the video game is done. Hard to say. I guess it depends on what you mean by done. Like we're almost in a state Where we would be able to just release the game. But there is still some polishing I want to do. And there isn't really a limit I set myself For how much polishing I am allowed to do. Let's look for patrons that want to beta test. I don't want to get into any legal trouble here. So I don't want to look for testers on Patreon. Level testing I wasn't expecting. Run through or intend to break. It's gameplay testing. Not bug testing. So I want you to just play the game As you normally would. If you're out of Mushroom Kingdom Fusion. Maybe. So yeah, the beta testing here Is literally just you casually playing the game. Be warned though That this is obviously an early version. And things will be rough. I want to set that expectation right away. The overworld I would say is maybe 30% done. But we're working slowly on the overworld. Because I want to Do all the beta testing stuff, you know. I made a list that was already 16 years in the making Myself. What the fuck. Gaming? What happened? Thank you for the subscription. Riolu. 36 months. Yes, you can use the milestone tracker. Which maybe I should update it at some point. Again. I haven't updated it in a while. I would say overworld 28% And... Chris 6% 10% Hello, CEO of  You need 8GB of VRAM in your graphics card These days to run titles at 140FP. I have no idea Do you know whether you do? Do you know whether you do? What is the 8GB used for? 2GB can do 1080. You need 2GB to do 1080. 144P has a crazy resolution. Why did they do that? Why didn't they just take 1080p And multiply it with the square root of 2? Why? Is there a significance to 1080? That I'm not seeing? Okay. I don't know what any of that means. Have any of you guys played the Zelda games on Wii U virtual console? Oh, that's hard, Ossef. Because I don't really know how far the 120 star test is. I feel like the 120 star test could come out anywhere within the next year to the next 10 years. Because if they just lock the fuck in and have 15 people working on it day in and day out I think they could do the whole thing in a year. From zero. And if they don't have anyone actually working on it then it could take forever. Because I remember when the test was started in like 2014. So it's been 11 years minimum, right? Dude, I am so hyped for the next 120 star test. It's gonna be so cool. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Simcasa or Case? I don't know. I really like this texture too. Very cave-y feeling. Okay.  Oui. That's nice. Yeah.  So. Which videos would you guys like to see next on YouTube? I need some tips on what content to make. I had a few banger ideas. I actually have like a full document of ideas that I think could do well. But if anyone has like a bad idea I'm up for it. Oh, I don't like this song at all. This makes me uncomfortable. I'm not running out of content actually. I have like 30 videos still in my back pocket. But I'm just not sure which one to make next. Is there any value in explaining the hash result split-screen multiplayer stuff functions? I don't know. I have a project in mind of the Rty I use. The next video I'm making is actually a banger. I think it could do really well. What the fuck was that? Maybe you know how the audio works on the N64? I have not. It's honestly not a topic I'm very well informed on. It would be very difficult to make a video about it. And yes, I'm saying I'm not very well informed on how to rewrite the entire Mario 64 audio engine. Hello, Maui. I'm waiting for something like Super Mario 64 Land. I mean, that's a very easy game to make. So that might be something to look into. But it's also not a game I am that passionate about, or it's not a type of game I am that passionate about, if that makes sense. Does it need SonicMate to run Mario 64? Oh yeah, Black Yorama is doing that. Oh god, but if I just take Black Yorama's project that he's been working on for so long, he's gonna be so sad then. But even then, I wouldn't just want to make a Sonic game on N64. It is more likely that after RTY I have to make my own games, my own IP entirely, which I have ideas for. Honestly, that would be like a great April 1st video. Hello, I don't know, Maso. Hello, Zimstarman. That's good. We like that here. I'm slowly starting to realize people really yearn for more technical content. The problem is, half the time I make technical content, it's so brainfucked that it's impossible to follow for a casual audience. So I should make educational content that's digestible. I think that's the plan. I think that's how I get famous. I don't know. What the hell is this? What the hell is this? Why is it like this? Am I stupid? Wait, isn't this a song from Mario Sunshine? Hello, Mario19764. Hello, Mario19764. Hello, Mario19764. That's weird that it just looked so wrong. Well, now it looks fine. That is a tall ask, but I yearn for more Zelda games like Ocarina of Time, Unleashed Mask, and now it's become one of them. I think it's so powerful that it just works. I was thinking of making a video on why that is not going to happen. Or rather, why it's unlikely to happen. Because there are some very good reasons there are so many Mario 64 hacks compared to Zelda Ocarina of Time hacks. That's cool, a Missing Link cartridge. I have one too. Missing Link is definitely one of my favorites. I don't know if that's a weird thing for me to say because I made the game, but I do not care. If you want it humble, then you are on the wrong channel. Over here we don't do humble, we do realistic. Making a video about why it's so difficult to make Zelda hacks might actually get more people into Zelda hacking. The secret Psyop plot. That's true, there are a few Star Fox hacks. Kint and Emma, I've definitely heard that name before. I would get a lot of views still, possibly. Honestly, I stopped worrying about getting views on YouTube and now I get so many views all the time. Falling in here sucks dude, holy shit this sucks. Oh my god, if I fell in here I would lose it. I would lose my cool. We can't have this in the game. This reminds me of a section in Tears of the Kingdom where I had to walk in a straight line basically and I fucking lost it. I couldn't do it anymore, I had to put the controller down. I think the main reason there are so many more Mario 64 hacks compared to Zelda hacks is because when you make a Mario 64 hack you don't have to really design the game. You can make some random platforms, some playgrounds and Mario's jumps are going to be fun. Nintendo already designed most of the game for you. When you make a Zelda hack you have to actually design the puzzles, the story, everything. It is so much harder to actually make a fun Zelda game than it is to make a fun Mario game. Not just about the fact that it's more work, it's just so much more difficult to make it fun. That's why when you play a Zelda hack they're almost all impossibly frustrating, boring, lame, suckballs. Whereas Mario games, it's super easy to make work. I think every OOT hack is going to be like that. Zelda game design is just not easy to pull off in my opinion. How much testing have you done, douchebags? Because I would assume that you only really realize how difficult they are once you do some testing. And then you will realize, oh shit, my game actually sucks. I think this is something every game designer has to go through. The harsh wake up call of like, oh, actually, my game sucks. I'm using Windows 10 right now because I don't want to have to set up my computer all over again. But I hope I can switch to Linux at some point. Definitely after long-term support for Windows 10 ends I'm going to switch to Linux. 10 years of playtesting, good, good. Yeah, then you really, really know how difficult it is. 16 years, that's such a long time dude, holy shit. If you do updates, are you going to debloat Win 11? I don't know what that means. Usually the first thing I do when I set up my Windows is like, debloat it as much as I can just do. But if there's like an actual process to it you can follow, then that would be even better. Because the way you're talking about it sounds like there is a program you can run that's going to debloat Windows for you or something. The problem I'm going to have with using Windows 10 forever is that security updates are going to be missing. And I'm one of the people that actually thinks security updates are important. Wait, copilot is built into Win 11. Serial projects are what you get when you don't resolve to do a number of small projects first. Ah, this one's a serial year project and I did many small ones. But I also would always recommend everyone to start with a bunch of small projects. It is a much more healthy approach. Circus ass music? True. What did I do? That's what I did. How do I make falling in here suck less? Falling in here is like the worst punishment the gods can bestow upon you. I also forgot how you get the star. Anyone remember? How do you get that? It just says in the part 4 cave. Huh? The mirror in the rainbow garden is a one way. There's a mirror? Wow. I guess there's supposed to be a mirror here. Okay. I forgot about the star. Wait, wasn't there an item you had to carry or something? We had an idea here. Shit, what was it? What was the star idea? I think sometimes I wanted to make the monogy of swimming. Yeah, I think something like that was planned but I need to remember the star idea first. Shit. What was it? How did I not write this down? I feel like we had a good idea too. We also wanted a mirror on the other side here, like a one-way mirror. Oh, I guess you could comb through worlds to find it. I'm not really interested in history like that. I have never been a history nerd for anything. Oh yeah, that happens in some areas, dark waves, but not everywhere. It's usually visually communicated when that will happen. What the fuck am I listening to? Oh, that looks cool. I don't know, that was definitely a good idea we had, and I'm more interested in finding that area again than I am in coming up with something else. I think this is kind of cool, that you can see into the cave here. That works pretty well. Makes the overworld feel more connected too. So what is the light effect, or glass? I don't know what you mean. This is just a... look, in Course 3, there is this mirror here that reflects the level back at you, and then in the overworld, there is this where you can look through the mirror. So basically, it's like a one-way mirror into the level. I think I need to look at my bots and find out what the idea was for the overworld here. Because I kind of need to know what the star idea was. Must have been a while ago. Here maybe?  Wow, my hair was so short. Okay. Was it during an earlier stream? Okay. This feels too late. If it was during the early streams, then it would be like here maybe. It's definitely me making the cave. Ugh, fuck. I probably actually drafted out the ideas for the cave way later. Shit. Yeah, I don't think I'm going to find it like that. Hmm. Yeah, Biobak might be the one to know. Okay. I think we had a current in here too. Honestly, we might have to just say put this cave on hold for now and work on this more later. Let's put this cave on hold. Why is this one so hideous? Nope, I do not remember. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay.   Somehow I can't get the color to be as nice as it is here. Hmm. Oh, that's kind of close. Maybe this is what I want. Okay. That looks good to me. This doesn't feel like a finished mountain. When you look from here, it just doesn't feel finished. Whereas this one does feel finished. So it needs to fully come to an end. Not like that. That looks more like a finished mountain. You don't think the idea was fully formed? That is a good chance that that's true. Wow, how did that happen again? This should be fine. Do you remember commenting on a video called like 739 Mew2King edgeguards? Yes. I remember watching that. Not a known fact, but I was really fucking cracked at Melee for a bit. I kind of want to pick up Melee again. 10 years. Yeah, 10 years ago. Sounds about right. That's when I really played Melee. Let's get some floor textures in here actually before we move on. Nintendo bodybuilder person? Oh, come on. I'm not a Nintendo person. I do not want to be known as a Nintendo person, please. Nintendo person is like a slur almost. Did you play Marth? Yes. The Rivals 2? No. Fighting games are like not games. They're sports to me. And the barrier to entry for a fighting game is so huge that I wouldn't want to get into one unless I would be fine with like sacrificing my life for it. You just click on UV mapping here. Mario bodybuilder man. That's a little better actually. It's because all the weird Nintendo nerds are like not Mario fans, right? Like there are very few weird Mario fans. It's usually like weird Pokemon fans or like weird Zelda fans. Do you know what I mean? Nintendo fans when they put level 35 into their bio instead of 35 years old. Mario fans are half like normal people that have like a normal job and they spend like barely any time on video games at all. Or they're like unhinged like Mario fans, which they're like so far removed from reality that they are not cringe anymore because you can't really. They're so impersonable to the average person that like it's hard to cringe at it. You know what I mean? Like they're freaks to a degree where like you don't perceive them as normal people anymore. I should have thought you'd be a Fox or Falcon man. I did want to main Fox at some point. That's like the first character I tried, but I realized that the amount of tech I would have to practice is so much that it's like impossible for me to get into it. And at the time I thought Marth was going to be just as good as Fox, if not better. I mean, I still am not sure that Fox or Marth is stronger. I think it'd be presumptuous of me to claim either one because you'd have to be like really good at the game to even have a valid opinion on this. And I'm not good enough for that. Why is it not painting? Oh, there we go. Hello, Pablo. Pikmin fans up psychotic. I don't really know any Pikmin fans like that. Cellophane will main you about the lore from My Name is Tinker Theory and the New Zeroth. It sounds like you meet people on Twitter. Yes Pablo, in 40 minutes I will release you from your mortal shell. How do you know that?  You have to be good to a point where you know everything about the game to be able to definitely be like, yeah Fox has the best moveset. I wouldn't be just comfortable making that claim. Even if you were literally the best player in the world, I would be like, well, you don't know everything about this game. I would take that with a grain of salt. Do you have any other donating options? Yeah, you can donate via my streamlabs. But Fox is definitely too technically demanding for me, I think. I don't know if I could ever practice enough to be good at him to a point where I feel comfortable being like, yeah, I'm done practicing. With Marth, that seems like much more manageable. I'm the type of player, I want to play perfect. I don't want to do like, okay, well, we're going for the ledge dash every time, we're doing the 17 frame reaction every single time. We're doing the tech chase like with power shielding. You know, that's the kind of person I am. So if I picked up Fox, I'd be like, yeah, I need to learn to do like 20 multishots in place. And I feel like I would never be able to do that. Thoughts on Miraclips, have you played it? I have not played it. The hack situation is extremely shitty. Let's see. I actually had DMs with Hax around the time where this whole thing happened. He's a very funny guy. Well, the test level of play, obviously Fox is the best, because, I mean, there's nothing, no counterplay, right? Because he has a frame one move, like what are you going to do against that? But obviously human reaction time, it's this dark period where suddenly things like range matters. I don't know what you mean, Rookie. I don't know. I don't know, I never understood why people are so against letting him play the game. I don't know. Miraclips by the beach, there will be fruit all over the place. There's characters like Martha, but I really don't much prefer playing at a slower pace. Well, I'm not glad that Puff exists, because she is so slow of a pace that I don't enjoy playing against her. If games against Puff were like two stock matches, then yeah, I would agree. Hex is the guy that made this controller here, the box. This is a controller you play specifically for melee, where all the buttons are laid out like this, so you can be much more consistent in your execution. He invented this because when he played with a Gamecube controller, he played the game so hard that he fucked up his hand permanently to where he would not be able to play with a normal controller anymore. Yeah, he helped design the controller. I don't think he is enough of a tech nerd to be able to do that. I mean, Puff is an interesting matchup and I like that she exists, I just don't like how long the matches with her go. There was this one Puff player on the EU melee scene, where if I played them, our matches almost always went to like 7 minutes. And that is so exhausting to play, holy shit. I don't know how much you feel the exhaustion like playing in tournaments or in grants like that. But I definitely felt it playing just online. But I always found all Smash games very exhausting to play. I don't know why. Is the Hbox crying mid set? I did not. Why was he crying? He was playing Trif and Grants and camping him out? What? Dude, Trif still plays? That's crazy. Wait, so he lost Puff against Peach? I thought that matchup was extremely lopsided. Holy shit, Trif is so good. Or did I miss something? Oh, he won, I see. God, I remember going to a melee tournament and there's the idea that melee players smell, right? And I never thought it to be true, but then there was this one top player from Spain, not Trif, who was over Triforce and he smelled a lot. And that's the only time I've met a Smasher that smelled bad. And then like two years later, I think he was outed as a pedophile. So like, okay, I guess he won't sneak up tournaments anymore. Will there be content for replayability, like green stars after you finish the full game? Kinda, there's something like green stars. Hello, Ethac, what is happening? We're making a Mario 64 mech. Yeah, Mario 64 should be very replayable by itself, just cause like... Well, if you're not having fun replaying it, then you're just playing the game wrong, right? Mario 64 is kind of a choose your own adventure type thing. Okay, the salt area definitely needs to become darker in the end, but I think this mostly works now. Oh, that was just like a Smash player. I don't know about that one, Goofbrush. I hate Armada so much. I don't hate Armada, why do you think that? Where did this come from? I don't hate Triax. Does Triax still speedrun Yoshi's Island? I haven't seen him stream in so long. No, that's probably why I haven't watched him in so long. Okay. So we got the yellow lightest thing. Nope, that's still a bug in first 64, not much I can do about it. I can just wait for them to fix it. For now. It's the kind of thing where only if no one fixes it for a really long time would I start looking into it. Myself. Okay. What he does now is when he sees the comment he doesn't like the rest of the game, he goes on 30 minutes to vote the comment. What? That's so lame. When you describe it like that, it kind of sounds like he went off on you once. But it could also be that he's just genuinely insecure and pathetic or something. But that's not how I ever perceived Triax to be, so I don't know. But I also haven't watched him in a long time. So. We will apply Bayesian thinking. Meaning I will be like, what this person told me is a possibility. But I am not 100% certain of that. Let's get it live and drop is going to stream and do the same thing when he was just streaming the game. Oh. So streaming is just drop. Some people just get one guide so hard to rule. Getting one guide is so tempting. You guys have no idea. As a content creator, when I upload a video. This is funny. So I get a lot of nitpicks on my technical videos. And in a way, that's a good thing. But also the nitpicks come from people who are like either genuinely people that know something I don't know. Which, you know, that's great. I get to learn something. But also it's often from people that like don't know shit. They just saying something because they want to be right or whatever. Or maybe because what I said like they don't like hearing it. So. Getting one guide by those is tempting. You guys probably remember the debate with the guy that said like const is not an optimization. And then we talked to him for a bit. But actually, I think we handled it well. Because like in the end. This is actually something that you will only see in this channel. We had a disagreement. And in the end, one party admitted they were wrong. Dude, can you imagine? I can actually argue with people. And then after the argument, the person can be like, dang, dude, I was wrong. Or I can argue with people. And at the end of the argument, I can be like, dang, I was wrong. Dude, that's a fucking talent. Can you imagine? Can you imagine if that existed in real life? That's not an optimization. Okay, one but science. Buddy. Okay. Did anyone pick the way you say access? Yes. He's not getting 1k views. Honestly, that's kind of sad. But in a way, this makes me hopeful he's gonna do Yoshi's Island again. Because honestly, I just want to see Yoshi's Island. I'm not someone who watches streamers for the streamer's sake. I'm watching for the game. Which, if you don't want that on your channel, that's fair enough. But you guys are kind of making me think like, oh, he somehow accumulated a bunch of haters now. Which is kind of sad. I don't want that for him. He is a fun streamer. And skinning games might be right after a Bruce. That's not too bad. Fair enough. We did pull out a Bruce.  Honestly, this is almost every time I see two other people argue. Both guys are just wrong. See, I subscribe to the theory that 95% of arguments are both people being stupid. Because usually, when two people have differing opinions, there's a difference in semantics they use. Which is the stupidest one of all. Where they use the same word, but mean it to mean different things. Or... It's a difference in ethics where it's like one person values one thing more than the other person values it sometimes it's a literal knowledge gap in which case you can just talk to each other and then one person knows more than he did before and some rare times it's both people have the same knowledge and the same ethics but they draw wrong conclusion because like one person is making a logical mistake and that that's a rough one but most of the time it's one of the first three and that makes it a stupid argument okay this area actually looks pretty freaking sick now i like it you probably want to darken this quite a bit although i'm a bit worried that you can't see it anymore in real n64 so i don't know i also don't like that that shines through the wall that's quite a problem can you even see that honestly that should be fine hello zelda i don't know people are just really bad at like thinking rationally they never apply bayesian thinking to any problem they just jump to conclusions they love doing that fish-shaped room with a lot of fantasy yes okay i think that is the first pass for the first four overworlds done now we have all the overworlds up to bazaar one we should send warps here just make in a light map around the crystals funny okay how am i doing why why do you need to know this why do you care huh will this cave room have crystals nope probably not okay can't i be curious nope trying to hack me i am curious about a lot of things so yeah i'll be curious about gargoyle don't you want to know why it says gargoyle in the text wow holy shit he knows my gargoyle oh that's the idea okay so the idea was there would be a crystal here and while you hold the crystal a path around mario appears and you can only attack with the path while you are holding the crystal  no i figured you knew gargoyle but i thought there was a chance hey hey hey hey do we still wanna do the crystal holding mission hmm tough call do this anytime so how about it's appreciated it helps a lot because now i remember the mission i think maybe we need to make the path always appear on mario and while you hold the crystal you see more of the path hmm hello kazooie yeah i like that too for the crystal holding mission if we have it fits best here for sure  yeah let's let's write it down so yeah that makes sense but how would that work actually oh i guess that would be multiple crystals okay yeah there are multiple crystals across multiple platforms  dark mario design that's for the dark mario game okay we still need to make it less miserable to fall in so i scratched open my elbow like a stupid bug bite i hate bug bites the bug bites in canada are so much worse than in germany in germany the bugs they just just itches in canada and it bleeds there is a placeholder yes  oh well no i think it's fine i think that's enough into the wall but i see your point oh this is what this is supposed to do yes hello moldy maybe there should be a tie drop going to the other side too i think that would be very cool oh it's not a tight drop but you get the idea so i might add some water decals here yeah some water reflections i think that could look cool oh we're not gonna worry too much about color right now because Biobak is doing a lot of this anyway we're also probably still gonna rework quest 3 at least the texture selection because some of it is kind of rough right now  poor Biobak true i think he finished the quest 3 rework wait he said he would update the progress tracker what does he say 75 but this is two weeks ago it's gotta be done by now he kept saying if i stream earlier this week then we could do this on stream yeah okay let's think about ways to make falling into the water less miserable um how about a bunch of tiny platforms that you can jump on to get back to the beginning sounds good to me that actually just sounds perfect to me and like it solves the whole  paper mario s song  fuck you nissan  five ads of nissan on the road bro you have to buy one do so here so so so hello x-stars i am glad you like the videos i have another video already ready to go actually it's gonna drop um on the 14th i would imagine the question is what is going to be the video after that i need to make two more videos for Squarespace and then i need to find a new sponsor no videos doing big numbers yeah it seems to be doing pretty well not sure i understand why but it's pretty good so yeah if you look at my videos like this is a one out of ten they're pretty much always increased like this one did better than the last one which did better than the previous one which is the previous one this is basically a linear increase it's like this one did way worse than i thought it would the shader one i thought would get tons of views and to think i only started making videos because Squarespace paid me i would not have made a single one of those videos if Squarespace didn't pay me to make those so when i say that you can watch the video thanks to Squarespace that is genuinely true not that i have any idea on whether Squarespace is actually good though i'm just saying being a little thankful to them so shit was really fair like outside of game devs people don't get excited about shaders how does this guy's video work is there a base repayment plus conversions or just conversions um no just just a base payment i would never take a conversion space deal they pay me 2500 flat per video basically i don't even know what i'm allowed to say i assume i am so true static types could do pretty well but yeah i do want like a solid base first Well, I think conversions based is generally just always a scam. I think this is because Gamerfuel offered me a conversions based thing. And they were like, yeah, we can give you a conversions based thing or a flat rate. Or a mix of both. And I said, well, the only one I want is the flat rate. Because otherwise I'm the one taking on all the risk for your product. Obviously I'm not doing that. What kind of idiot would take on all the risk? What the fuck do you think of me? And they were like, well, yeah, let's do the flat rate one. And then they just never got back to me. They just ghosted me. They were just hoping I would take on all the business risk myself. Plus, in-game subs was probably literal poison. So I'm not sure I would have taken the deal anyway. What sponsor would you be willing to advertise for on a conversions based basis? The N64 Digital. It's a pretty good thing that I can genuinely advertise without feeling like I'm selling people garbage. Maybe one of the FPGAs, once they are actually there and decent and I've tested them. How about a Soylent ad read? Honestly, I am not opposed to Soylent. Telling on Skype, but since you have been making all platforms 6 sites and most of the guys went priority, would you make each one a slightly different number of sites? Yeah, I mean, obviously that's something we want in the future. For now it doesn't matter. Okay.  So there is definitely shortcuts you can do here. But I think we want that. Something like Vice Simple is also something I could genuinely just advertise without feeling like I'm scamming people. Because that's something I actually also use myself. Wealth Simple, not Vice Simple. I know what you mean, Etheric. Don't worry. Hmm. Yeah, I think these are good shortcuts. These are also not easy shortcuts, so that's fine. It's not like shoot into the wild blue away, just do a side flip. Shortcuts are always tempting to do some insanely technical shit, but at the same time, I don't think people would want that. I've heard CSGO gambling sponsorships are also pretty good. That's how you get rich. So I'm waiting for one of those. I actually do have a Call of Counter-Strike inventory worth like $3,000, but I've never played the game. It's intended that the splash effect is a different shade of color than the water. Looks a bit off to me. It has a color setting per area that we still need to set. And gambling. True. But it's not real gambling. You don't get money, you get in-game items. It's completely different. Entirely different scenario. Yeah, that's good. Keep your kids away from gambling. Especially your sons. I think girls are a lot less prone to gambling addiction than males, right? Okay. Would I want to have a Tektra? Yes. But maybe not right now. Dude, I had so much fun gambling in a theme park I went to once. I was like 8 or 9. And you were allowed to gamble for plushies and stuff. I got so many plushies. Your great-grandma loves Star Wars because it's a gamble moment? Oh. Well, especially keep your kids away from it if it runs in the family. Oh, he's asking for Roblox, but he gave him to the classics. That's good. Big mindset? Your son will gamble all his pocket money? At least make him gamble in Poker or Blackjack or something, where you can theoretically have a slight edge. There's no edging in gambling. Oh, there definitely is edging in gambling. The near-miss fallacy? Dude, that's like half of gambling. Gambling is full of edging. Hmm. Near-miss fallacy? See, this is edging. It's not like a gift of it. Okay. Okay, so when a player becomes motivated to continue expanding Efrot, because the previous Efrot almost succeeded, it gives them many endeavors, especially those with a highly documented setting in gambling. This is just edging, but for gambling. I can Nintendo for life. You should get a hacked Wii or hacked Wii U Extras. It can have all those games, and you can just download whichever one you want. Very much recommend that. Roblox is older than Minecraft? Okay. The only song in the universe that can give you your virginity back is this one right here. If you ever wanted it back, just listen to this on repeat. I don't know. I've never seen it. This is a tremendous save from what it once was. It's ADHD building in Predator Central now. Never played it. I don't know. Well, actually, I did play it once, because they gave me money to play it on stream. Okay, this should probably just connect to this, and then it can wrap around here. And then we have something there. All right, that works. This can just go around here into that. I think the texture I'm most worried about is the dirt texture here, because the dirt doesn't look good. All right, this works. With the new OST, I don't want to listen to Margo's Wonder anymore. I feel so slumpy today. I mean, the overworld has some decent shaders, but I wouldn't say it's that pretty yet. Still got tons of stuff to do. We finished the first four parts, and there's 14 parts here in total. But of course, the planning and the designing took a lot of time, too. We're probably beyond 30%, but then we also need to program stuff still, so eh, hard to say. Yeah, the progress page says 30% right now. What do you mean, it translates? Pokémon, oh sure, let's listen to Omega and the OST. God, I yearn for them to make good Pokémon games again. Playing Pokémon Snap, trying to get a top score was so fun. That could look really nice, actually. Dude, we've been here before. I have played these games before. This situation happened three weeks ago. This exact situation. I was here. I've never played ORAS. Maybe I should. I have no one to diss on Paul now. I'm not trying to make it work with Paul right now. I imagine making it work with Paul is as simple as setting the AI frequency and the AI mod. So I'm not worried about it. I'm not worried about it at all. Don't play it, I don't think it's worth it personally. Worth what? The time? What does it refer to in this context? Wait, what? My chat is disabled? What happened? I might have to refresh this. Okay, I think my chat is back. We usually love it, really, if the team grew up with it. But I never played Ruby or Sapphire growing up either, so it would be my first experience with Hoenn. I don't know, Shadowboy. Just let me work. The reason it's going slow right now is because I spent a lot of time making videos and doing beta tests for previous levels. So I just do not have the time to spend a lot more time on this. Oh, you don't think it's worth the time? Okay, that's interesting. Why, is the original better than the remake? Oh, I see. Dude, this fucking sucks. This looks so bad. I think we want something more like this. Yeah, I think we want greenery. Okay. Honestly, I'm not even sure what I'm looking for in a Pokemon game, hard to put it into consideration. The one thing I want from it, is that it is not the best strategy to just overlevel one guy. I think that's the number one change I would want to see in Pokemon games before I'm interested in picking them up again. So, the question is, in this game, is it the best strategy to just overlevel one guy? And by best I mean the one that you can choose. Oh, I just picked the one that looks the coolest. Very simple in that regard. I Yeah, that would be more like what I would want in Dutch, or where maybe the level curve is adjusted like that. That's true, out of the Honest Dungeons, I don't know which one I actually like the most. They also use it again, just use a single Pokemon. Well, sure, the question is whether that's like the fastest strategy on how to beat the game. I was honestly thinking about maybe playing Mario Man. I liked Sun and Moon a lot too. I think Sun and Moon is like my favorite one of the recent ones. For me it's like, this is a rage speed tier list. Here's my top three tier list, okay? One, Red and Blue. Two, Diamond and Pearl. Three, Sun and Moon. It's very likely that it is so high up because I was like eight when I played it. So what? I never really got into Gold and Silver. There's a good reason for this. So I did get Gold and Silver when I was a kid, but the cartridge I got, it had like a level 100 Ho-Oh on it, and I was like, there's a level 100 Ho-Oh on this. I don't want to lose the level 100 Ho-Oh I got for free. So I didn't reset the game. So I was just stuck in a game where it's like everything's already been done. There's a level 100 Ho-Oh that doesn't listen to my comments because I didn't have enough badges. I have no idea where the game wants me to go. That sucked, obviously. So that is a lucky kid that found out. Hmm, this is still not quite what I want. Hmm. Maybe this is passable? Let's take a look at it again. It might be as awful as that. Ah, look how bad that looks in comparison. Hmm. Hmm. Did you look at other creator like Agica? I've definitely talked to Agica on Discord before. Hmm. But I don't know what you mean by look at him. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.    Something weird's happening where the first time I press Alt J it just doesn't work. Hmm. That time it worked. Weird. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.   Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.  Hmm.     Hmm.    Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.  Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.      Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.  Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.  Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.       Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.   Hmm. Our eggs are way bad, I've never played them either, I'm making it sound like they're terrible. Honestly the grass looks fine, seeing it like this, I don't hate it, I actually kinda like it. Hello Skyloft. I think we're already on overworld part 6 out of 14. And this one shouldn't take that long. Oh, but something weird happened here, a little bit of a triangulation issue, I would say. Yoshi Tumble, that's a dojo. I have also not played Sword and Shield. I'm not as much of a Pokemon nerd as you guys, evidently. Composite is anti-aliasing at zero cost? I don't know about that one. It's kind of just as much. Alright, I think for today I am done and we're gonna continue this another time, maybe tomorrow, but no guarantees. So until next stream, bye bye!
