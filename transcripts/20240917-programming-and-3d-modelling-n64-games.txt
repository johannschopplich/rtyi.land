You Warning the stunts in this movie Wait a minute Bah bah bah bah oh there we go Hello Hey, yo What just happened? It's sonic the hedge god Subscribing to my channel Vince staples John wood veneers I Want a styrofoam texture here Oh, that's what I'm listening to I see the song is a banger Hello I'm gonna leave the texture here. I'm gonna cut down the line. I trim it back down This doesn't feel like styrofoam I Want this, oh actually that's exactly what it is. I need to find a way to make this look good This is a broken. Yeah, so we find a way to call  So the question is how do we get a decent styrofoam material hello x-links Basically while making this mountain I had the idea that maybe making a styrofoam thing with better Beach Hello Sarah There's going to be 15 courses in total So, yeah this mountain here I think it would look better if it was made out of styrofoam and we could do this in less polygons and Would be another interesting material to after this course Well, what's that monsters manner is better than beyond the curse mirror Interesting I will agree that monsters manner is more of an interesting concept But I mean there isn't really much of a concept behind curse mirror, it's just Mario levels, but Hello perch Can use a sea sponge texture maybe here let me see what a sea sponge looks like It's very similar, yeah I Mean I can just go sponge. It's very similar By the way Lilaa Your idea worked I applied your idea in the entire game it saved like 30 instructions or so, I forgot how many exactly Unfortunately, that means we have very cursed code like this and Once a fine matrices are in we will have this code here which divides by 12 and 6 instructions And 10 nanoseconds, it's a little more it's like six seven microseconds Monsters manner was nice until the fucking toy city dude. I hated it so much I Wonder if we can somehow make a decent looking material out of this I'd like lightning to be kind of reflective off of it So the easiest thing to do would be to just have it be reflected random directions, but that will look terrible Then there's the idea of setting shade color, which I think could look decent Hello, Oshie So what if we have like a base color texture and then we had shade color? multiply with the texture that Subtracts lighting depending on how far away you look from the thing Or maybe ads depending on how far you're looking away from the thing so that way we could have like a depth of map I Think that could work. So one would be subtract Probably subtract the deep parts sonic 1 minus texture 0 I Just know detail in this anymore It's too much detail in this maybe something in that All right, Lila, I don't care about that right now Please stay on topic Oh god, that looks terrible. Why does it look this bad? I Can be streaming markers I want to You know what my least favorite thing about streaming is people asking me stuff that doesn't the truth to what I'm doing right now I really don't want to talk about things. I want to just talk about making my game. That's all I want This is not even like this or anything. It's just I can't do it anymore, man I Maybe like a sponge texture would be the right move, but this doesn't look good. Yeah, and it's a jpeg artifacting for sure What am I doing I'm making a texture for styrofoam or Material rather I want decent-looking styrofoam and my idea for it is we have one text zero. It's like nearly white and it will have a Second texture and the second texture will be subtracted depending on the view angle So that way hopefully we can get some of the fake bump mapping going on There was this article about bump mapping on n64, but it relies on being a specific way if I remember correctly Hello Alec Something like this might work It's basically a picture of pebbles So I'm just gonna put a block here and this will be a block of styrofoam in the end Why skate that bump mapping but it has four times over draw and it only works on one normal song I Hope it doesn't work because I turned it off But let's listen to it Dude I turned it off. I don't want some request exists in my stream anymore, but I guess I can't turn it off Hello scared I Don't hate the song. Oh, that's not as good as the other one The M plus and my texture I can position for each textures look really awful. Yeah This is kind of styrofoam II or this die, all right Well, you sure this engine says grandma's in the hospital again And it's a fucked-up toad simple flip sent this to me Yep, it's all arts and craft It's the entire song like this Boy yeah, right. Yeah, right. Yeah, right doesn't really look like styrofoam to me There's also an option like this which I think might work I  This is kind of nice, oh, but this is the lighting direction baked in doesn't it? I Seem to the coding language or compiling program coding language Boy yeah, right. Yeah, right. Yeah, right. Oh I think this is what I want You Those artifacts don't matter This is the meme reveal Oh to in Japanese funny in Japanese well played thank you for this revelation Hello, Josiah, I Train YouTube and twitch equally So you shouldn't be worrying about that Ideally you wouldn't be worrying about that Looks decent to me We will need to increase the contrast here So That it actually looks decent in game. Oh, that's kind of nice Yeah, that's kind of nice I'll see as we're just listening to nightcare songs today I Looks terrible So the question is how do we make this look decent now It also looks good them. Oh, I like the texture you're showing me here One day, I think I prefer this one I Don't see boy How do we make this proper So I definitely need a light to be shineable on here somehow I Can do something like this Then we can color it here This is the highlight color Shake a dozen shade color alpha doesn't do anything Whoa, why not? Oh, that's why I This is not what I wanted to be like I Don't read this contrast make it brighter When I read this contrast I can just add prim color here Let me think about this so what do we really want Which parts of the texture do we want to light up Do we want to light up the inner parts when you're looking at it Well, this is not really about texture resolution this is more about light effects I think light effects are much more important here I What we could do is do like a circle around each individual thing here Yes, I stream when I want to please leave me alone I just want to work on my game And Why does my hint no longer work? That is bizarre. What I could do is a primitive color alpha here and then, oh no I can't, shit. I could use primitive color alpha here and subtract from that instead. That way we can make parts darker as well. That looks a little more 3D. Although now it has one point where it kinda inverts. I don't like this part here. It might disappear if I give this a bit of a color. Although this doesn't make any sense now. Mh... Yeah. Difficult! I also don't like how obviously this texture repeats. That is a serious issue here. I don't understand why you don't just use lights to make the effect. What kind of lights are you thinking? You mean like instead of vertex colors we use lights? How do we do that? How is that better than using vertex alpha? Okay, why don't we just use the vertex alpha in camera space like exactly what you're describing. You can overbrighten the light. I can already do the vertex alpha. What kind of effect are you going for? I want it to look as close to real styrofoam as I can. So ideally it would be like full bright while you look at it from the front, but then when you look at it from the side, like yeah, it's still like a styrofoam cube we can look at. So I suggested lights. How is that better than using vertex alpha to fake the lights? How is that different rather? Setting a video styrofoam? Yes. He doesn't really rotate the styrofoam, does he? He kind of rotates it here. How does it change our perception of the styrofoam? Styrofoam carving. Dude, I'm about to actually just buy styrofoam. Okay, nice. He rotated here. Now we can have a proper look. So you can see one side is lit up and then look, you can see how in the dark lights there's like no highlights now, but then as soon as he turns it, highlights start to appear. That's what I want. Oh yeah, that is nice. I need that. Okay, it's enough of highlights up here when you rotate the styrofoam.  And wait, why don't the highlights appear? Oops. Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn. Am I going the wrong way? I am. Come on, spin that styrofoam for me. Yeah. Okay, where do they appear? On the rims. Oh, on the rims that point upwards towards the light. That makes a lot of sense. Okay, so we need, I mean, the highlights are drawn in here. So we need a texture without the highlights and then a texture that is just the highlights that we multiply with shade alpha. And then when the reflection hits just right, we can increase shade alpha. So if we can get a texture that is like this, but without the highlights, that would be perfect. Not what I want. Where's the curse? I want to know. I want to know. Why should I care? Let me breathe. You tell me why. I hear the sound. The sound of my dreams. What would we be better off? What would we be better off? Modeling a patch of styrofoam in Blender and then taking a screenshot of that and then adding that. Like we just 3D model the texture. I could 3D model a few bubbles like this. Take a picture from above, have the insides be dark and then afterwards UV map onto each individual bump a projected texture of the shine so that the shine is what we see. I think that's what we'll do. We will 3D model the texture. No, I think it's best we 3D model this. I don't think I need that Lila. I'll just get a texture for the highlight, do a bunch of blobs and then take a picture. Okay, if I had a displacement map, I wouldn't need to make the freaking 3D modeling. Oh, wait, this is a terrible idea. I'll just use an environment map. With a highlight on it, that should look like a ball. Why does this not work? Shouldn't I be able to just change this? I guess not. What's this for Lila? All these cost money. We've been on that website at the beginning of the stream. Hello, the progress. And what do I do with this texture, Lila? Use this as a displacement map is what you said. All right, fine. But you will have to teach me how to do it. So you said to make a texture here, whatever that means. I'm guessing it means doing this. And then we make it in video and now what?  It's one of these displacements somehow. I want to use the shading tab. Is this shading? It is. Cool, cool, cool. But even if we do render that out, how's that going to help? Because I'm going to have to change this afterwards to get the highlight from the top. I guess I can move lights around. All right, let's Google. It's a 16 minute tutorial. Cool. Oh, don't worry about it. It's just a lot of people ask me a lot of things that are not related to me hacking the game. And I really just want to hack the game. I find it very exhausting to have to engage in social stuff when I just want to work. Search for text tutorials. I need this. Oh, boy. The rendering tab? I don't think so. This is all new. It's going well. This should be right. Okay, let's see. Do I need geometry notes? Looks like it. Doesn't look like geometry notes. Rendering.  That's what you said. No, that was a different shading tab that I clicked on. This one here. Okay, cool. You're saying I need diffuse BDSF and not print support? How do I input the texture here? How do I add anything? Hmm. Like this, I guess. Okay. That's not it. Placement a bump from height. What the hell? What's this got to do with what I'm doing? This is very different. I think it's the first thing we want. How do I add a texture? Search for the texture in the add tab. Add texture. Image texture. All right, I will need to make this simpler. Oh, what the hell? That's not the right texture, is it? It is not. Which texture was it that you just sent me? Let me check. This one. You said normal also works? Okay. How do I cut the connection? Huh? That cut the connection for some reason. It doesn't work, Lila. Wait, nothing works anymore. Why did it stop working? Move to normal connection. How? Why can't it just be alt click? I understand everything. Control right click. And drag a little knife icon through an existing connection. What the fuck? What the fuck?  Well, it still doesn't work. Why didn't it stop working? This is so annoying. Learning new tech is always so goddamn annoying. I can just distance maybe? That's what I did before. But it just stopped working. It just randomly stopped working. Stopped working it was working just now how I need to change this one too never mind it didn't randomly stop working it must be gonna change that so where does it get its light from? does it just pick a random direction to be the light? how can this be? add a light? well clearly it's not using this as the light let's pick the random direction change the easy render oh that does something now this texture is so crunchy holy shit this looks terrible the strength is too high well I was already experimenting with that clearly that's not the issue though oh the still looks terrible it's still got the direction big then yeah it doesn't look like styrofoam I mean this is a useful technique and maybe I can make use of this but not with this texture here this also is lighting up there this one might work premium only so let's inspect the elements a 218 by 218 jpeg I don't want a 218 by 218 jpeg maybe this one interesting idea why does the visual change so much depending on how I zoom so if I understand this right then as soon as I rotate the sun should be different okay let's change everything yet nope doesn't really look like styrofoam yeah it doesn't have the individual bubbles that I want I wonder if something like this is close ah not really I define textures for google images I guess what else looks like styrofoam this is lighting baked in again I want the one with the bubbles on top that's what I was gonna do extanic and then Lilaa had a stroke foam insulation yeah that's pretty close unfortunately this is lighting baked in again of course ceiling but in my case you have to take the picture I have no idea what you're talking about maybe we can do this with one of my cobblestone textures give AI a chance I don't think AI can do seamless textures yet although I guess it wouldn't be the end of the world it wasn't seamless why don't you give AI a chance foam insulation equals styrofoam so EPS or XPS I don't know those words now to remove light from an image you have to recap the lighting the photo was taken from the image oh that's so easy to do from rough brick I think styrofoam might be looking too unique to do any of these workarounds it's I also don't feel like this is actually displacing the height like at all this looks like it's just drawing the texture to me oh actually maybe it is doing more than that yeah I think this can work in the end we just need to find the right texture for this I'm using displacement okay finally I will switch to using displacement see if that's different although I am doing exactly what you linked in your thing makes no difference oh this is so much better what the hell I did I read the thing that you sent me are you saying I need to use all three this guy only uses one of the three oh I guess yes this one's severed you think I should use this instead I need cycles for this place am I not on cycles how can I tell which one I'm on is this cycles render properties somewhere in here this one I don't really see it subdivision I can do subdivision it doesn't seem to actually displace anything though it still looks very flat it is subdivided a hundred times now robot voice oh I must be because I'm using nvidia broadcast so when I'm moving my camera maybe my graphics card is being used a lot surely don't know why it's working well I've never worked with this if you don't know then we're kind of hopeless I just did what your thing asked me to do do I need to use mid-level 0.5 or something restart the render how do I do that we switch between Eevee and Cycles and then it works what's up Ron we're trying to make a styrofoam material for the N64 that looks decent but it does not look decent I think it has a lot of potential though we just need the right textures for this basically we need an unlit thing and then we need a lit thing and depending on how you look at it camera wise the lit part is going to lit up more what normals I even use for input I don't know nothing I guess I mean it doesn't use any normals in the tutorial here so I wonder what you imagine it should look like yeah right here if you look at this you see how when he turns this the highlights disappear like right now there's no highlights and then as soon as he turns it you see these white highlights appear at the top of each individual bubble that's what I want what's in material top it's gonna work it's just we need the right textures so what we're doing right now we're doing this to generate textures and I have a solution on how to generate textures but Chad said there was a better way to do this so I'm trying to do it Chad's way so dimension to bump and displace here where's bump and displace some material instead of displacement there's like bump and displacement somehow I've never worked with this you guys need to realize I only use fast64 for blend off if you BDSF I'm already on BDSF do I need a different one use the search bar there's no search bar oh you mean here there's no bump and displace wait is there a search bar in here somehow that I don't know of it's a flag like transparency can I how's their search bar um that would be an insanely useful feature oh there we go so I was told that this is computed on switch so I need to switch again so okay there's still a problem of the lighting being being used gpu for cycles is faster okay doesn't really seem to make a difference so okay up here yeah so this texture still has a big lighting which is why it doesn't work I think I want the material to just be pure white if I can somehow that would be nice it is pure white right is it not hmm I have never done blender materials before x-tenic never in my entire life yeah my textures for displacement doesn't matter though because there's lighting baked in here so the lighting will change the placement so we still need a texture that we can use for displacement so we can actually afterwards render the highlights this looks somewhat fitting but it's inverted from what I want but if I just invert this texture maybe it works let's try it um pony stream foam can i remove all the detail in here somehow without turning into complete shit like i feel like i need something like this and then if the white parts displace further then this might work for what i want oh median blur what is that it's a thing that might be a good idea if that's like a thing i don't see median blur no i don't lot this just doesn't work and it doesn't look good and shall i try my way i feel like this is not going anywhere Why is it so dark? Has to be because it's the wrong renderer, right? Garden of Ban-Ban-Level of Apology, true. That should work in the end, right? I feel like if we just do this and then render the text out from there, it will be exactly what we want. I just don't understand why it's so dark. It should be white, oh wait, my combiner is complete garbage. Okay, seriously though, why is this such a weird color now? Hey, there we go. I wish there was a more exact way to set that. Well, this is not good though. And we need a texture that is, one, a shine and two, the actual texture, the color of the underlying geometry. So, we kind of need to render out the same thing twice, although this really didn't work because now we have these weird parts here that are like not good. Bubble wrap texture, wait. That is a banger idea. This might be exactly what I want. It's maybe a little too ordered. I have no idea what that is, Extanic. Maybe distorted, yeah, I could just use liquify and distort this a little bit, but I don't like how the gaps here look. Ask an AI to generate it. Which one? Do we ask Dolly? Sure. Generate me a seamlessly tiling styrofoam texture with a neutral light direction. Let's see what it comes up with. Just so we get this one out of our system. That's not a neutral light direction. And the other one's not even a bubble wrap. And this one's not even styrofoam. All right, we got that one out of our system now. It's a good job for a shader. I never made Blender shaders. I know how to do them in Unreal Engine. I don't want to learn how to do them in Blender right now. Even the shitty prompt. Wait, how did you want to modify the prompt? What did I miss on my prompt? Well this one's for sure not gonna work. I know that much now. So normal texture method not viable option. I don't have a normal texture. If I had those textures, I wouldn't need to do anything anymore. Make it snazzy? All right, I will add make it snazzy to the prompt. On your command. I don't know what snazzy means. So your idea was worse? Great, well neither idea worked. I asked her to make it snazzy, I did this. Polystream normal texture. If we had a polystream texture, this would solve our entire issue, I think. Like if we had one like this with a neutral light direction. This one's too small. We're gonna spend the entire stream working on Styrofoam, aren't we? Too small zoom and then it's too low res. Well I do have a video recorded where I talked to ChenGPT about Mario 64 optimization for a little bit. So if you want to know about AI, that will be something to look forward to. I've had an interesting experience. It was mostly producing garbage, but it actually came up with a few good things. This is also too detailed, too crunchy. Should I just draw the texture? Would that be better? Could I just draw the texture? Is there anything new? It had one good optimization idea and a lot of bad ideas, basically. I need to start out from a black canvas and put white blobs on here and that might do what we need. I don't think I'm going to be good at making a texture, but I want to see how far I can get here. I probably should have started with a much higher resolution and then just scaled it down. That's awful. There's no way you can take that video you're working on and make the overriding below and then go to start with convergence.  Tidy mode? Not that I would know of. That would make this so much easier. Let me think about this. If we had this type of texture, we could just... Even then, it would still be a lot of manual just drawing stuff in. So I have little hope in that. Maybe I should get a learned substance painter. Maybe that would be faster than this at this point. You've been saying that you can tile in Photoshop, but you forgot how to do it for three years now. Three? Where's the polyserene one? Is it this one here? I kind of want the bubbles on the outside. Yes, I'm having difficulty creating a texture. That's what the entire stream has been about so far. Hold up, let me cook. Rushe, have you been having? I'll make one for you. Okay, basically, I need one texture. That's the pattern here without any lighting. And then I need all the highlights seen from a light from above. You see how the highlights appear when he turns the thing? I need those highlights that appear. 64 by 64, both textures. View pattern view? Wait. I think that might not be in my version. Volley noise? What's that? Oh, that's very similar to what we need. This is foley noise. Maybe I should have just used the cobblestone texture, but it would have looked bad, I think. I'm on some old version. I don't know which one. Random guess?  Don't know if it's true. Tech chicken? I don't know what tech chicken is. Let's check that. Chicken styrofoam. I think this is what we used at the beginning, yeah? And it didn't work. The sponge doesn't work either. Well, we've tried this before and I didn't find anything decent, so I have no hope for this. This one looks somewhat promising. Whenever it takes something like this and I just draw highlights. Generate static, then select by color, use the growth shrink to get the size. Okay, I'm already lost on step one. Generate static doesn't mean anything to me. It's like no depth to this, the way I've made it. Is there more depth to this? What if I invert it? No. Why is there no depth to this? It's in the filter render, I believe. That's what I think is in the exposure shot. Nope. Actually. Okay. Shouldn't this work? Usually this works. But it's not supposed to have a direction at all. Yes, YouTube links might just get removed from chat automatically. I mean, it certainly looks like there's some depth to it, but I don't know how that will translate in game. Let's take a look at this anyway, just to see if I get any depth vibes or not. Oh, that's terrible. Cool. Is it invisible bump maps? No. We're making a fake bump map here, basically. That's why we need these two specific textures. You can split the image into three images. One for red, one for green, one for blue. And you can control the lighting it receives, and you can bake it into a normal picture. Well, we don't have a normal map. If we had a normal map, this problem would be solved. But it looked terrible. Don't worry, Xlinks is cooking. Maybe he comes up with something. Looks like the Floor & Room Fortress kinda. This is definitely not what we want. Even this looked a lot better than that. Right, and this looks like it has some depth to it already. And like this is with the stupid big lighting direction that we don't even want. How do we even compute the lighting direction in the end? So let's say we should probably like find the angle from the vertex to the light and then the angle from Mario to the light and check how similar they are. Do we need the position for that? I think we do. So we bake the percentage of how close the reflection is to being between Mario's eye and the light into the vertex. That's basically what we do. And that way it will light up like, yeah you can kinda see what I mean here. I think it will look really good. We just have to, you know, get it to work. We just need to get the texture. The worst part is, even once we have that, I'm still not 100% sure it will work. So all this work might be for nothing. Maybe I can find another polystyrene texture that fits what I want while I'm waiting for X-Links. We just need to pick up some serifem with a flashlight from two different angles. That actually might be like one of our best options, Barbie dude. What's wrong with this brown serifem other than it's brown? It doesn't look good. What I have in mind is gonna look way better than what we are having right now. This one doesn't look too bad. If we can take the highlights out, I think it has potential. Surely it's possible to take the light out here somehow. Can I zoom in on this? What if I first rescale this into a more reasonable region and then do that? Tray filter, camera raw filter, where would that be? We can fix the tiling, that's not the big issue. Yeah, I don't know where this camera raw filter is. It's not installed. That's what I thought. Wait, could I maybe just...? No, it's too crunchy... Yes, MadDog, there is a YouTube chat that you can't see. We will eventually get this. At this point it would have been faster to 3D model this texture. If only this one didn't look so depthless. I wish I understood why it didn't have any depth, but I don't know anything about 2D Maybe we should just start looking for cobbled stone textures that might work. Can you get a bump map to a displacement map? Maybe, I mean, there just weren't very many decent textures for this at all, right? Like, this is way too low-res. Or I guess I can download this. Maybe that would work. Let me just see, download with free trial... I have to make a plan for this. Yeah, I'm not buying a plan. What is this? It's a JPEG. So, can you just turn that into a bump map and, like, use that or something? How is the texture called? Normal.jpeg? Are you saying I can use something like this and just somehow turn this into what I want? Like so, maybe? I guess I need to switch back to the other one. This? Cycles? I don't know, I've never done this before. Does this need to go here, maybe? I'm googling polystring texture avas0017. This one? Is this what I do? Apparently not. It was invented. It doesn't look like it. I never worked with blender shaders before, so this is all new to me. Set the color space to non-color. That's crazy mapping. It doesn't seem to be what we want. Maybe if I go in here? Well, that seems closer to something real. You can do these up to a new dimension, then enable bump. This is very subdivided. Then enable bump and displace from material settings. The displacement bump is enabled. Color to bump's height? Really? Are you sure about this? Invert doesn't seem to do anything. Don't need to switch between the renders again. Remove normal connection. Why does invert not do anything? Your mic is struggling? Yeah, because it's rendering so much. I feel like I'm getting a lot of random advice that doesn't actually work. Is this set as a height map? I don't think we want this as a height map. Well, I guess we do. I think it's been reduced. I'll see, but I'm not sure. Start the strength around. No, it's a normal map. But people were telling me to use that. How did you use that? Dude, this still has the lighting baked in. After all this time, the texture still has a lighting direction baked in. I don't know. It's the one we have. But this is light baked in the end. Like this texture just doesn't work because it has the light baked in already. You can see it has the top darker. We want to make the light ourselves. I feel like at this point, 3D modeling texture is the only way out. Yes, the highlights. We need one texture without light baked in and then one texture where we bake the highlights in. That's the entire point of what we're doing. Yeah, this is awful. So we have to compute the highlights from now on in real time on N64. Well, you can't actually do that unless you know the normal of the circles you're working on. And then you need one material per normal that you want to use in your level, which would be really bad. I tried to use levels earlier and it didn't really work. It doesn't matter which way the levels are facing. The lighting is baked in. There's a lighting in here. You can tell from the white pixels. It means they're facing upright. But you can also just tell from this. I am not doing amazing. We're struggling with this. Get a better texture. That's the entire issue. We've been working on that for two hours now. I'm just going to Google this. I don't find what you told me to do. Oh, I see this. Can I have the green channel work? No. Would it help if the darker bits were also white? No. Explain what the final texture should be. We want one texture that's just the general shape of this. With all the dark parts and everything in there. To have these little bubbles everywhere. Then we want a second texture that's all the highlights that appear when you shine a light at it from directly above. Then what we're going to do is we're going to control the highlights depending on what the angle between the surface, the light, and Mario is. While the light is mirroring into the camera, we're going to increase the vertex alpha to make the highlights appear. That way it's going to look like there's a bump map on the thing in-game. Hopefully. If everything was well. By my imagination, it would be good. But maybe something appears that I can't think about yet. All right, Danik. I will take a look. It's on my Discord. Let's see what you sent me there. Alright, let me just play around with some of this. Let's see. So I can reduce the density to do that, cool, cool. That makes them smaller, but I don't think this matters at all because they're balls. One issue with this is that all the balls are all the same shape. Can you simulate bump mapping by making index texture with a big than lighting direction change depending on the palette used? That works once per every normal that you have in your entire level and we're gonna have this material at many different rotations so that doesn't work. 0.005 I can try that but it's still like it's way too dense. It's on the collection. Oh, cool, cool. So one particles, okay, so I can make more. That's sick. Does it use all four now? It looks like it is supposed to use all four but these are all underground. They're clearly not evenly used here. I'm playing this over a noise shader. Can you expand a random for a noise texture for this to work? I don't know what that is. So this is a voronoi shader. What does it do? But this is also weird how like one texture is so much more used than or one of them is so much more used than the others. Do they all have the same origin? Uh-huh. Oh, they're all just the same. No, this is basically the same ball. This is not random distributing very well. Switch to Eevee to see it. I'm on Eevee. I'm going to check random instance. Is this a random one? It seems random. Hmm, it still doesn't really do what we want. Oh, just here. It's still the same though. I don't know. It doesn't seem to do anything. Work on something else while your minions make your texture. But I want to make a texture first. Depending on how good this looks, I will make like different things. Although I guess I can work on programming the vertex alpha part already. I guess I'll do that. Huh. Explain, is this fire and do you have a link or is it on your local PC? No, this is just YouTube Autoplayer. No, I'm not against AI generated stuff, really. But I also have very little faith in it. So let's think about this. What can we pre-compute? Basically, you get angle between the vertex normal and the light, right? It's okay to start a rough approximation. Anyway, let's make sure everything goes well. It also seems good. I'm making a few hundred columns of reading data. All right, next links. Where did you send this to me? Oh, I see. No, wait, this was the toilet paper from yesterday. Let's see. I think this is what I want, yeah? Let me look at this in Blender, so I have a better idea of what this will actually be like. Probably needs to be a little more dense. And a bit more shapely, if that makes sense. This looks like it's bald, but I think the top of them is kind of flat. There'll be five Mario coins. You can collect them in the game when the game is done. Come to think of it, I want to try this one more time. Why does this make things brighter? I don't know. Yeah, this just doesn't look like anything anymore. Hello, Mush-Chan. We've been working a little on the level and more just on one material. So, one, do that. Two. Do we want the angle between the normal and... Ah, wait, do we have to actually store the vertex normals? Or can we store something else? The problem with storing the vertex normals is we don't know the surrounding stuff. Did you figure it out? Nope. I'll let X-Linx take a look first. I just did use levels, Mad Dog. Shit, okay, we can't just get the vertex... Well, we can get the vertex normal, but that would mean exporting twice. Or not having vertex colors. Epic Lila. I did not think making styrofoam would turn into this much of a disaster. Okay, so the problem with this will be that we will need to export it once normally and then once with normals, which I guess we can do. We can just start two versions of this and one doesn't render or something. And then when we have that, we can get the angle. Store the angle to the flag with one being yaw and the other being pitch. Obviously, we do not need roll. Then we get the pitch difference between the light up top and... Or is it enough to just get the yaw difference? Forget the yaw difference. How would that work out? We've got the light from here going at the thing and then when Mario is here, he would see it. Is that good? Where does the light bounce? It bounces here and then goes back up, right? So it's at like a 90 degree angle. So I guess the pitch will always be like 60 degrees ish. So we only really need the yaw. Do we need the yaw at all? Can we just only use the pitch? Will that look good at all? Improved styrofoam screenshots. I can check it again. Let me see that. That is kind of nice, yeah? So there's these little crooks in here that I'm not sure about. All right, but let me think about this part first. Just assume the light bounces like off in every direction. Then... Oh, there's also... If the thing looks away from the light, there shouldn't be any bouncing lights. So for that we need the vertex normal. But then does the yaw ever matter actually? It would be really nice if we could transition the textures depending on the camera yaw. But it doesn't make any sense actually. We can only do the pitch this way. That sucks. So something absolutely insane we could do that I'm thinking about right now. What if the styrofoam was only allowed to be at like four or five different rotations and then with someone else or something? Is this what you're looking for? It's very close. They're still all like these weird parts here that I'm not really sold on. But it's getting there. Okay, no. See what I'm saying is what if this thing is only allowed to be at like let's say eight different rotations. There's eight rotations styrofoam can be at in this level. And then for every single rotation we do Dan's CI4 palette trick where we compute the lighting bounce by storing a normal per pixel. So we just have to compute like 96 vector multiplications or vector dot products. You just took a picture of styrofoam. Let's fucking go. I'm working on it. Yeah, so if we did that where it's only allowed to be at a couple of rotations we could use that method. Buy styrofoam and photograph it yourself. Honestly, I'm not far away from doing that. But if we did that we would just need one normal map of styrofoam. And that would only be allowed to be 16 normals. And then we would just compute all of them. We would just multiply them out at runtime. So well if we're going with this idea I'm having right now we would need a normal map and not a picture like this. So we would run into that issue. So do we actually need xyz normals or is x and z normals enough? Or you wish you had x3? Yeah, this is pretty nice. So  If this feature worked well, that would be amazing. So the texture is seamless originally. So doing something forbidden. We're going to make this texture seamless. Use this for a quick seamless. That works. All right, let's try it. Wait, that did like no difference. That works. It kind of works. Can take support solomaps? Nope. We're just gonna program this basically. That looks weird. Yeah, I'm thinking what's right now. Basically, okay. What we would want is we're going to export a normal map. And then we have 16 vectors in this normal map. These 16 vectors are going to. We're going to multiply them with the angle between the camera. And the light. And afterwards. We're going to start a result of the multiplication and in the normal location in the palette. So by doing that, we have the percentage that the light is reflecting of each pixel into the camera stored as a grayscale value. And then we can just multiply this with our vertex color. To get a brightness for each pixel. But this has the limitation that we can only have surfaces with this texture at a limited amount of rotations in game. So I'm thinking we're going to limit ourselves to six rotations. Or maybe eight. You guys get the idea? This is something Daryl did before. But not with the texture like this. I also don't think it looks good at that row as a resolution. Like this is just not a good texture for it. I also don't like them storing them as RGBA32, but it should be fine. A cube is six rotations. So yeah. It is very limiting. It brings me back. All the voices in my head. Reminding me of what I have. If I fall tonight. You can bring me back to life. If I fall tonight. You can be my saving light. Link Zos 3. What's that? Is that a setting here? I don't know. Cool. You can be my saving. It doesn't look too repetitive to me. No cube. I mean, I know I see what you're thinking there, but now it is six rotations. And 60 minutes is excellent. Well, this is nothing right now. In the end, it's going to look like this except the changes colors. When you look at it from different angles. Yeah, I think it has a lot of potential. So we're going to name this West. Check discord maybe. Normal output. Okay. That is kind of nice. Let's see what Link Zos. Uh-huh. Maybe a normal output version of this works. I mean, there's still like these weird parts here or here, where it's like, it looks like cells undergoing metosis. This looks more like the styrofoam. I was thinking. Let me just think about what this picture here means. So. As the red channel increases, the light is coming from that direction. So return of zero means the light is coming from that direction. And then as the blue channel increases, the light is coming from that. You know, the blue channel is always up. The blue channel is like into the screen. And then the green channel is up and down. What did you redeem? I can't even see. And see a mouse. Oops. What's the RGB of this? 267B. Okay, so that's kind of up to. A2. This texture has way too little contrast. That's my issue with this texture. I need something with more contrast than this. This is not gonna do as well. Maybe, maybe this will do better this way. All right, let me think about this one here. So you have green to mean the right direction. And then you have R to mean left and right. And B is into the screen. Yeah, this might just work for what I want to do. Sure, Lily, you can post it. Yes, Sonic, we're working on styrofoam. Yeah, I think this texture has potential here. But that does look like styrofoam. This is going to take a little bit to program. You know what the worst part is? On top of that, we have to rotate the texture by 90 degrees. That's it. Like we have to rotate it from this way to be like this way and this way and this way and this way and also this way. Can you rotate a normal map online? Rotate normal map online. What the fuck? Why would anyone want this? That is clearly not the point of rotating a normal map. I'm going to change the axis. Actually, I don't need to do that. I can just do that on boot. All right, let's do this again. Generate all eight normal maps from the one. Two. Make the normal maps up into memory. Three, overwrite the normal maps every frame. With. Even invert R and G, not rotate. Yeah, or sometimes flip R and B or whatever. I mean, you know what I mean by rotate, right? There is only one way to rotate a normal map. If not like the actual 2D image. All right, the pixels of the normal map every frame by the percentage of light. It should reflect into the camera. Light reflection is computed by. So angle in is angle out, right? So we need to. Why would you need eight different normal maps if a single one can encode every direction? Because the normal map does not know which direction it is facing. We have to get a normal map for every facing direction so that we can compute the grayscale values of every pixel in the normal map manually in game. That's if you have tangents. Well, we don't. We're in the N64. We don't have a shader. We have to implement normal maps without a shader. It faces every direction. That's the issue. Basically, we have to assume every normal map is just facing the positive axis forward. That's how this is going to render. But then we just change the normal map to like be rotated so that when we do the same multiplications, we get the pixels as though it was from above. But have I missed just two hours of talking about styrofoam? Yeah, exactly what Cookie Resortzman said. The N64 also can't do normal maps. We have to compute the output of the normal map before we pass this to the renderer on the CPU, which fortunately is cheap, which is why we used 16 directions. Do you get the idea now? By getting the light reflection angle and blur ping between 0 and 255, depending on how much we are looking at bits. Or well, maybe even brightness at 255. Yeah, so this is the idea and I'm very confident this will work. Well, right now, I'm going to try it with this one and then I'm going to try your styrofoam. Once we have the code for it done once, it should be very easy to just, yeah. So this is something Daryl made first. I can't take credit for this. Although Daryl only made it work for one direction. Does it have to tile? Yes, absolutely. Thinking about this. We can do more than eight normal maps if we want, but every single extra one we do is going to be a lot more data cost. Oh, hell no, I'm not doing that for free. Fair. That's the link if it let me post. It did not let you post. You can just post it on my Discord and then I will see it. Just make every normal a box. Well, every piece of styrofoam can be made into a box, but I want like a styrofoam triangle as well. So that's a bit of an issue. Likely what we will do is... So we have a box, box needs six directions. But the light's coming from here, right? That's like a point light in space. So we have a box here with those directions from the bottom and from the side. We know that there's no light being reflected, right? Actually, there has to be some light reflected, otherwise it will look like nothing. But like from the bottom, no one really needs to see that. So really we can get away with five normal maps for a full box. And then we can have one normal map for like being sideways. So we can like make a triangle or like even sideways and slightly rotated even. And then, you know, that's like three more rotations we can have. I think we're fine. And at the end, that's just 128 vector multiplications. Should be relatively cheap. It's definitely cheaper than the Shy Guy Google sales. So yeah, this is what we will do. And oh, oh, this is a nice texture. Has potential, but this is a bit weird. This looks like the thing is placed on top of another thing, right? Like here. I'm not really a fan of that. There's also this orange part here, which is oh, actually, that's I guess just like to the left. Or from the left. Yeah. Either way, I think we have a plan that works now. We have a texture that's decent. I just need to program it all. I will see you guys next stream. This has been enough for now. I know what to do now, though, and it will look really good. You guys will love it. You guys should be here next stream so you can see it for sure. But yeah, I will see you then. Bye bye.
