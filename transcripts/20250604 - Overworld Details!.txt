Wow, what the hell is going on? That was weird. Hello Biobak, someone. Long time no see. Every time I hit the press stream button in the last week, I was like, okay, this is the way that I'm going to be forced to do Dino Dino Domain, Divine Dino Domain. I did some work on course seven recently, and look what I did. I love this so much. I disabled the music here, just so we can hear this better. You hear all the sounds? Makes this feel so much better. Oh my god, that fucking sucks, Biobak. Good for you, my stream is probably going to be exactly two hours. Whoa, what the fuck, why can't I do it? This too. You hear the elevator sound here? And the fire. And the rollercoaster sounds, I love this. And these guys have sounds too. I didn't destroy it. I think I'll hang on to that. I don't like that I can hit it one more time. Wow. It reminds me of the Bowser Jr. noise in Mario Kart Double Dash. When you switch the cart, you know the noise, everyone knows the noise. I'm sure you know the noise. And he goes, Eya! That was not a good impression. Probably Saturday, alright, alright. Sounds promising. Hello, Moldy, welcome back. Okay. I'm not done with the actors, oh shit, okay. Well, I think best to have all at the same time. So we'll probably just hold off on that. I should finally record this stupid fucking quiz-free analysis. And keep putting it off. I've had a note to record that analysis for about... Two months now, three months, four maybe, five, six, seven. Something like that. Yo, what the hell is going on here? This is bizarre. Oh, I see. Hey. Man, this new UV mapping tool is great. Any OST wishes today?  And oh my god, dude, I made the most important fix in history yesterday. The audio crackling is gone. Crackling, dude, can you believe it? Okay, let's just celebrate. Half time done enjoying my own music. Or well, but it's music. There we go. Huh, it's just like that. I don't know why they look so different. Isn't that crazy? Oh, it's... oh well, this is fine. Yeah, but that's the exact same material. So it doesn't really make sense. Hello, Tassan64, having fun developing those video games? No, actually. Developing video games is suffering. The Buddhists had it right when they said that life is suffering. Because what do you do if you're not suffering? Scrolling TikTok reels? Those are the two things you can do as a human. One, suffer. Two, scroll TikTok reels and forget your life. Hello, Siak. Okay, I heard a little bit of crunch just now. TikTok reels is suffering, that too. It's like you're suffering no matter what. Send me a case teddy bear for him back. I was actually in talk with a merch company today. And if you're lucky, we can organize those. I don't know what I'm talking about. There's a buzz on my speaker, something on the song anyway. There is a rare buzz, and I don't know what it is. But today I did some audio fixes that removed a lot of buzz. So, I don't know. There might be an issue with the samples being deleted. People don't believe me when I say I hate video games. Until they see me play a video game. I don't know why I'm doing this.       I don't know how much you missed, Viovec. We added... Actually, never mind. We didn't add anything. I don't think you missed anything in this room, but you were in the last room. That looks so much better than before. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was the last room. I said there's nothing I need to update you on. So, I was just talking to Lachmelot. Secret conversations. Yeah, I know famous people. What about it? Actually, is Lachmelot still famous? Do you guys know who Lachmelot is? Oh god. So later I wanted to make new tree lines. Dude, Lilaa, I have a lilac tree out in my garden and it's fucking annoying. What did I do to you? Yeah, a lilac tree. This is what they look like. I know, it's way bigger than that. It's like this, but way bigger. Oh, I have the biggest lilac tree of all time, but it's way bigger than any of these. How can you eat it? Because it sheds all the leaves and then they're everywhere. I'm not shedding it, it is shedding by itself. No, no, no, no, they go on the floor and they get all muddy and dirty. It is not just pretty pink leaves, it is like suffering. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yes.  So I want non-volcanic rock here. Like this. Oh wee. Ooh. Yeah, I think that works. That was so easy to make look decent. Wow. I'll press another button instead of SX0. Because SX0 doesn't do what I want. The straight that I did also moves all the other vertices in a minimum distortion way. So it actually looks good. But just the SX0 looks terrible. So good in the end I think you guys ever think about how easy it would be to like make a fun Mario 64 like where it's just like fuck it here's 50 new levels I'm not programming shit just like this doesn't look offensively bad people would love that shit dude scan accident in 2011 true but we could make it run on the n64 that was actually the initial vision for our team but then it became so much bigger I could shit out a hack like that in like two weeks just like I did with my 64 madness in 2011 hey you can still add a bunch of custom code you just have to keep it simple making like simple moving objects I think the main reason this egg is taking long is because we have like character attractions and stuff the YouTube chat isn't connected what the hell also I'm gonna showcase this again look at all the ambience effects these guys make an elevator noise and the ferris wheel is elevator noise from the rollercoaster he's here brutally going into the curse I got a flame here we got a shy guy noise what's not even done yet just adding a couple sound effects makes it why did why not fix that rollercoaster stuff what's so bad about the rollercoaster stuff well how else are you gonna do it you can't hear me it's the game too loud shall I pull this out it feeling cheap as a surprise but if I you sent me area once last opaque is not cold but you said it is I didn't say the last opaque was called I said there is an opaque mine-cart stop from mine level but you are in a rollercoaster dude how cool is that also the minecart star is changed it's just get to the end no maybe but there's some kind of issue in here they know it might have to be with one of the actors in here that you know keeps talking to thing on the wall so well they are attacked on but like how else are we gonna do it I think it's gonna hit me my safe here what's so bad about the pokey carrying the the balls around just isn't fun it's like textbook I don't be missing and I don't think it's fun at all plus you get to write the fucking rollercoaster how cool is that I don't think that fixes the issue I think it just is more fun for Mario to be like I'm here and Mario's all I need when the music oh I just put the music on I just had it off for a short time so we can listen to the ambience in the game so I can listen to the ambience and working on the ambience effects here this is what I call safe pin on one with a new thing oh yeah that's a node I have written down Lilaa oh shit I wanted to check out the old world whoops I completely forgot now this I'll just crush this when I enter it cool I forgot about that it is your fault why what did you do oh I have no idea I don't think it is the grand music back here in this area because that would definitely crash it I don't think so what degree you go for in school none they wouldn't give me one you so my boss is my GM that one chapter 3 and 4 are coming out in it tomorrow I heard about this on your Twitter that you aren't planning on playing the game so make sure to watch out for spoilers on the way out I have never tried to avoid any Deltarune spoilers and I've never received any Deltarune spoilers I think if you are someone who gets spoiled then you just hang around the spaces I'm not hanging around so I'm not worried about it at all I can't promise anything I mean there is still the one bug to work on so I mean what difference does it make although I really should figure out why this level here crashes because I think Sauron needs this or is this like a bug in the emulator which the one with the lighting do you not see how the lighting keeps changing in my level I didn't see it what the hell you don't think that's me well I don't know load area terrain walk yeah I exported with right all I exported all the actors with right all the problem is I can't use RT 64 here because it only works on RNG and RNG doesn't work with RT UI so yeah and comet we can remove because I think we're out of memory in this level so let me just make up some memory by killing unused assets you delete your fucking plane again oh my god why is that removed why is what removed the comet and the UFO platform because they didn't make the cut into the final game they were just nonsense again I guess and yeah I believe it at the back is by another actor oh my god I hate this animation this is a newer version of project 64 by the way we're hoping that this one will work hey it was a RAM issue I need to fix this for solemn actually I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it on request by Sora in this area you get a little piece extra you see that this is how it starts now I think it's pretty cool what do you think yay me you like it she loves me she loves me not is the game RAM constrained? not really they're just very wasteful of RAM so it may seem that way and this opens up a nice shortcut like this too well it's not wasting if the 8MB is there anyway right pushing the button text I get some B3313 yes this bottom text is very essential to gameplay N4, TM1, AM1, BM1 yes very mysterious that one doesn't properly rotate I guess that can be added and I think that level is also exported without Bleed-In-Line so we're gonna get a little more RAM from that I need to put Push this real quick. It does need it. So that's why we're gonna get some ramp from that. So, we had some notes for this. How much RAM am I even using anyway? Well, we're using the whole 8MB, just because that saves some time in how we program this and if we have 8MB anyway, we might as well use all 8. Why is the YouTube chat not working? Let me see this. Chat settings. Yeah, I don't know. Did they fuck this up somehow? Wait, we have 54 people watching on YouTube and I can't see any of your comments? What the hell? Unfortunately, I don't see a way to disable this. Huh, I mean it pretends that YouTube can be implemented. What is this? This is not on. Wait, why is Case Clip grayed out here? You see that? It just grayed this out. I can be on Switch, but I can't be on YouTube. What the fuck? The YouTube chat broke. Support chat told me that there was an issue with YouTube today and it should be fixed. Cool. We experienced temporary issues with YouTube, but it's resolved now. Really? Let me just F5 this. Nope, it is not resolved. Okay, well, the sensitive info of someone could use that and then display my chat in their stream. Oh no. Yeah, unfortunately, I can't resolve the YouTube situation. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry. I hope at least the YouTube chatters are telling the other YouTube chatters that it's not working rather than me ignoring them. It's the only thing in this area with the Bowser level entrance. That is a little crazy, is it not? How do you get to the cloud cap level? Oh, the wing cap level. Do we not have the wing cap level planned in? Wait. Cloud cap, bomb cap. Where the fuck is the wing cap? We indeed do not have the wing cap planned in. How did I forget about that? Should probably be here, right? Okay. So there is a baby Yoshi that really can't wait for the ship to get finished building because he wants to ride it. He jumps on your head on entry. You have to ship build, but I mean with X stars to power it. Okay, that makes sense. So there's going to be a flying shipyard here. And when you have enough stars, you jump on and the cutscene starts and flies off. Good. Now the wing cap level. There is Koopa with Koff here and the wing cap is going to be above it. We need to think of a way to get there. Do I really have no way? Any notes I wrote? It's for when Koopa with Koff. Oh. Oh. The hotel room. Right. That makes sense. Okay. Okay. Now I can make more sense out of this. Did I already edit there or did I just say we were going to edit there? Let's see. Okay. Well, I definitely didn't edit there yet because the game is crashing.  This overworld seems a little big for what it does. 835. Okay. Okay. Really? Oh, it's 0, not 8. Of course it really doesn't exist. I should let Fnatic know. Actually, that crash might be a consequence of the framebuffer not being emulated. I do do optimizations, yes. That is one of the things I do. But I also make a cool game. Can you imagine? I'll get a cool game. Alright, let's see. So this is going to be where the final boss happens. Aldo's path to the level entrance. Is this fine? Do I get here just to find out? Oh, you don't have enough stars here. Probably. People always say it looks great in a completely unfinished area. Or they suggest improvements for the completely unfinished area. No in-between. Or sometimes they complain that it looks unfinished. Like Lina just now. Okay, you can't get up there without any help. That's good. The boss fight area kind of needs to be this size, right? And if we have the melons there, maybe that makes it fine. Do we have a melon-farming star here? Oh right, the shaggy-ass attack game. Is that a star? Yep, it is. Okay. So, I don't like how far out this is. Because there seems to be no gameplay reason for that. My real job is not a game design job. It's a game programmer job. And I can't tell you what I'm making without breaking NDA. So it would be illegal for me to answer the question. Okay.  Seems a little more reasonable. I kind of want this even smaller. But how do I do that without making the ship fly right into the wall? Maybe like so? Okay. I finished 100%ing Majora's Mask for the first time yesterday. What a banger of a game. I don't believe it was actually made in two years. I refuse. The Nintendo I know would never do that. Okay. It's too good for that. Let's see if this feels more appropriate. Okay. Okay. Okay, I kind of like how... What's the word? It's very imposing. I don't really have a preferred emulator. Well, I guess I do have the preferred emulator for Project 64. But it's not a good emulator. Kind of every emulator that exists right now has some huge issues. That make it so that you can't really use it. And Project 64 has those issues too. But the issues on Project 64 are like the smallest out of the bunch. And if you have one shitty emulator, at least you can work around the limitations of the shitty emulator. This is supposed to be the shipyard. This is where they build the flying ship. And then once you have enough star power, it flies off.  Do you ever get an animation dev and help correct the issues? What do you mean by would you ever? I guess is the question. Because I mean like, if I was offered a million dollars to do it a year, then of course I would. But it's not like I have a moral issue with it. It's not like killing a person. Oh my god, you know what my biggest fear is? So I've seen Jordan Peterson. Whenever you ask him a question, he instead of answering the question, I was like, what do you mean by this word and this word and this word? My biggest fear is that people are going to accuse me of talking like Jordan Peterson. Because I also always clarify. But I do it in good faith, I promise. Thank you for watching! Yeah, it is kinda difficult to know which emulator to use. There is no definite guide, especially because there's a lot of rom-macs that exist that require you to use an emulator that doesn't work correctly, because the rom-mac doesn't work correctly to begin with. So what you gonna do? There's AORUS, which is the Legendary Cycle Accurate, but even that has some crashes in it that only exist in AORUS and not in N64, because it's not like perfectly cycle-accurate, which I guess just means it's not cycle-accurate. So I don't know. But I know that the AORUS emulator is developed by some people that are like really good at what they do. And finally realized why it looks so good. Until then, we'll just keep doing this. I can almost imagine that there's going to be something in the future where people are like, oh, remember old video games and how they always used this unrealistic ambient occlusion. Kind of like how we now talk about Wii era games and their bloom. The bloom in Wii era games is genuinely hilarious though. Games that are on AI upscaling. What? Games use AI upscaling? That is complete news to me. Or I guess you mean DLSS? Yeah, I guess a lot of games do rely on DLSS. DLSS AI? Let me see. We live in an era where I never know what people mean when they say AI. Like is every neural net an AI? But then also people are like, well, AI doesn't exist yet. It's like, okay, what do you mean then? You know what I mean? Okay. You know DLSS works? No, I actually don't. DLSS in this game in a low internal resolution. I was going to say big 2D display resolution. You're right, but I don't know how that works. You might have a different understanding of what it means when you understand how something works. You don't know programming? Well, just from the fact that it upscales, you can't deduce it's AI. I mean, I believe it's AI. I'm just saying like there is no piece of data for me to take any understanding of this here. Assuming this is based on training data. As in you render one high-res screenshot and then one low-res screenshot and that's the training data. So it's literally the FBI enhanced meme. Let's utilize the steam learning models. I see. The weirdest Mario is basically Hyper Ultimate Mario. Alright, dude. For my money, I think the weirdest Mario is Red Cowboy Mario. And when he gets upset, he turns into Blue Cowboy Mario. And Blue Cowboy Mario, you don't want to get near him. Okay. The question is, isn't the only form of AI I'm scanning in the NSF design is ESS? Let's see. I think it'd be fun to try and implement DLSS on the N64. It feels like something they would do in like Lit Dragon maybe. That would be pretty sick. And because I'm a fan of DLSS or anything, I actually have no idea how DLSS even looks. I've never used DLSS in my entire life. But because it's a cool technique. I don't know. I'm not sure. I mean, obviously, you can implement a neural net. And obviously, you can read and write data. So like, yes, of course, it is possible. The question is, can it ever look good? And that, I don't know. I've been watching a patchmaker's workshop live on YouTube. What do you think about the hack so far? I mostly like it. The parts I dislike about it is like vanilla Mario 64 stuff, usually. A lot of the vanilla Mario 64 stuff is still present in the hack. It's like, ugh. Every time you interact with it. I think I just cannot play Mario 64 hacks anymore. How to encode a network? I'm not really sure what that means. I'm not good with words like that. Well, the hack has a story, which I think is very cool. I like that. I wish we had more hacks that just weren't afraid to have a story like that. So that's good. It's definitely like, in terms of how ROM hacks usually go, it's unique. And I do like unique video games. In fact, unique video games is specifically what I'm seeking out when I play a video game. I want new experiences. In your network, you have one large layer of inputs, one layer of outputs, 20 nodes each, and then a smaller layer in between. You train the network, and then you cut it in half. Train the network produces input equals output, and then you get... Oh, I see, I see, I see. Okay, but that doesn't make sense in terms of DLSS. Because that would produce a middle part that's completely fucked up. If the explanation from DLSS that I just gathered from chat is to be believed, then DLSS would only be the second part of that, the second half of it. The user part? No, the whole part is the second half. Because how are you going to produce that fucked up encoded version at runtime? You'd have to render the HD version, and then fuck it up into the mangled version, and then apply DLSS to upscale it again. But no, you want to start with the half version, right? So you only have to produce half the output. At least that's the only way that makes sense to me. Okay. It would probably make sense if each pixel only had to consider the pixels around it. Because likely that is more efficient, right? And still just as correct. Does that actually take just a bit of reverse input when you're rendering it? Oh, it doesn't just take the pixel buffer input? Maybe it takes like two pixel buffers or something. But that would also be weird. That would lead to weird visual artifacts across multiple frames. Maybe it also needs like a depth buffer or something. I think something about the motion vector, which has to be painfully debugged to be in the right domain. Oh, oh shit, wait, I just realized I'm talking to Ray March, long time no see. I see, okay, whenever you say that, I will believe you. I believe you that something about that is correct, even though I don't fully understand it. Because I know you know what you're talking about. Yeah, see, okay, you have to understand my skepticism. So many times when you talk about like a gamer, about a programming concept, they are just going to say shit. They're just gonna say shit. Even if it makes no sense. It will just be like, this is how I understand it, and this is the ground truth. You wouldn't believe how many conversations I've had about people saying Mario 64X don't work on N64 because they need 8 megabytes of RAM.  18 multiplied by 64. It's 1, 2, 8, 0, minus 1, 2, 8, that's 1, 1, 5, 4? No! How is that wrong? I was off by 2? I was off by 2. Hmm. See, that's how you can tell I'm getting old. Oh, that's kind of a beautiful color. Which math do you do in your head? Not much, why? Only when it's like optimal to do it in my head, I do it in my head. Oof, that's ugly. Ugh. Ugh. I am just naturally decent at math, like I never practiced it. I was just born with the ability to be relatively fast at math. But I'm sure someone who actually practices math would be a lot faster than me. I actually think this is something I genuinely believe. Any math problem, any mental math problem presented to you, like half the work is already believing you can do it. A lot of people will have a mental math problem presented to them and they'll be like, I can't do it, and not even start doing the math. It's not reading volcanic here, so let's use the non-volcanic rock. This one here. I have definitely lost a lot of my integral solving skills after I stopped going to university. The leg. Yeah, I moved to Canada in 2021. I'm still living here. Yep, I live here with my wife and a little baby actually. Oh, you don't need to congratulate me, it was pretty easy to make. Honestly, took no skill at all. Anyone could have done it. Let's take a quick look at what we've done. It's true, being a dad is hard, but that's true. Okay, so it's gay month, are we gay now? I mean, I don't want to be gay, no. I wouldn't know how to start. Yes, it is, shift key. Hello, green dynamite. This is gonna be like the biggest overworld in a Mario game ever. Think about it. Has there ever actually been a Mario game with an overworld as close in size to this? Like Mario Sunshine, I think is the biggest overworld, right? Okay, the blue looks pretty nice, I think. Wow, these are way too dark, holy shit. I fucked something up here. Oh, I know what I did. Because they're the same material. Oh, I didn't even count that as a Mario game. Can you maybe, over here, do some messed up stuff like... Walking here, thirsty, and then... Walking over there, and then get up? So, this is gonna be just like this. You need to beat Bowser too, so plant Rose to get up here. But there's nothing stopping you from being here and then just walking to the next area. Which is the mushroom area here. I'm pretty sure people are gonna find a way to skip it. Oh, Last Impact is nowhere close in size to this overworld. Has the N64 Amiga scene been hit by Nintendo Lawyers 2? No. In fact, I am not confident that Nintendo is capable of hitting them with Lawyers. Switch devs? Just because I'm not sure that they made the same mistakes as the Switch devs. Is that the fairy game? I think it is, right? Yeah. Why'd they make her like this? They knew what they were doing. I have not played it, but I've seen someone play it. Cybill? Did Cybill make that game? Who's Cybill? Oh, that's the main character. Look, I'm not saying she's not hot. I'm saying that's like a 100% guaranteed furry babe. You know what? That's the best I can offer you for June. I think Cybill is kinda hot. That's my June confession. What? It doesn't stand for anything. It's just a character. They absolutely would do that. They have done that everywhere, right? Isn't that a straight confession though? Yeah, but it's a little into furry territory, so I don't know man. But it's like, of course you're attracted to the human parts. That's the whole point of her.  For a second I thought I was going to hear Zelda's lullaby. I don't know. Okay. Okay. I think you would like it considering this movement is so fun. It looked kinda poopy when I saw it, to be honest. It looked very, like, my first Super Mario 64 hack to me. He never wear non- There are no textures? That sounds like a bad idea to me. Why would you want a level that is ugly on purpose? Or do you have some other vision for that? Hello, Dana. Someone just suggested it and I put it on. Wait, yes, that is Epona's song. Meow, meow, meow. Meow, meow, meow. Yeah, that's Epona. That's Epona. Okay. Okay. Well, hopefully next week the YouTube chat works again. I have new Unreal Engine. Five times a week. For around seven hours at a time. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  That was so easy to make look decent. What do you think about SteamOS? Never heard of it. Hmm. I don't think I want to deal with making the ship yet. I don't have any idea for it anyway. Um... You have an issue with that buffer bit precision on the N64? Okay, I don't understand what you mean by distance. Oh, definitely. I have that issue. Um... That issue is actually amplified because in F3D... The precision is twice as high as it is in F3DX. And I was using F3DX for the longest time. But fortunately, just recently, we got an upgrade to F3DX3. Which is like a custom microcode that Sauraen is working on. And... That has increased the precision eightfold, if I remember correctly. Without any cost. Just because Nintendo had a weird operation in all their microcodes that lost a lot of precision. That we don't need. If I understand it correctly. So the precision issue is going to be much smaller in my game. But still existent. But yeah, if you look at my game on N64, you'll see some of that. I can boot it up real quick. It's floating... Yeah, floating point. No, no, fixed point. Fuck, what am I saying? I can take a quick look at this level here. This is N64 now. This is without anti-aliasing, so some of it looks pretty rough. I'm going to create a source. Attention is just prompting me whether or not I clicked on it. I have no idea what you're talking about. I guess you can not really see many issues here. Let me turn on anti-aliasing. Looks so much nicer. Not even the windows have issues. That's weird. I thought this level would for sure have issues. Maybe this is already about the eight times increased precision. Looks good to me. City's not in this area that takes us out of my neighborhood because they're far apart no This is so cool. Oh my god, that was a 16fps frame. What the hell? That's rough What do you miss custom music? Yes, the entire list is custom. We already have over 100 custom songs You Many songs are strings. I Think it's around 15 More than 10 less than 20 for sure Actually Less than 25. Maybe it is 20 because we have little stuff like the star kids jingle as well. That's dreams the star select theme What a puzzle-solve jingle You Right, this is going to be a melon farming fields, how does a melon farm look like? Not fucking minecraft what how is there like more minecraft melon farms than real melon farms? I Mean the long time ago you made a pirate ship sail and tried to sell you on an island strength that didn't work Well, I know what you mean This one Well, some of it worked I think I'm not sure if Biobak completely replaced the sail texture Or if you just put holes into it, but this looks a lot more pirate-y now Yeah, I think last time you were here was before this level got reworked Level looks a lot more pirate-y now Now the foam effect is missing Especially stuff like this room looks a lot nicer now Yeah, it's all part of the same hack we finished 15 courses now and now we're just finishing the overworld So we are like the final stretch It is a gigantic game probably four times the size of the original and it all runs on real hardware so Okay, looks like we're just gonna have to have the melons grow out of the floor Even if I google melon farm real life I get fucking minecraft Unbelievable Send me a picture of your melon farm create source I Okay, nevermind I don't need to see your stuff Oh You're gonna start AI argument number 55 if you keep going like that People you love discussing I Don't know anything about the ps2, so I'm the wrong person to ask I Know I work at guests for breakfast there in Denmark just remotely Yes head and time is unreal engine 3 I've definitely heard about the pains of ue3. I'm working here It sounds like a complete nightmare I Honestly after working with unreal engine 5 for so long I Feel like if I ever wanted to make my own game, I would use my own engine to discuss how atrocious it is I You don't like making one change and then spending five minutes compiling and booting up your game You don't think needing five minutes to make one change is reasonable no way I That really is the worst part about working the fact that it takes so long to make any changes I Heard then go that has like a scripting language that you can also compile and that to me sounds like the perfect version I Guess you get the advantage of being able to quickly iterate via the scripting and you can get get the advantage of like compiling for performance But I haven't actually used it so maybe it's poopy for other reasons that I'm not saying I It is poopy or it is good I'm not sure what the timing of the this is it is poopy shit I What's wrong with it I It's good GD scans like Python but actually suited for games very good if you make a non-dominant game, you know, it's good useful Well, the idea is that if you compile then even if it is a demanding game it doesn't matter I Disagree that I'm the lantern is suited to make games Okay, maybe I'm not that much of an electron maybe it is fine Maybe I am over exaggerating right now I With the reference semantics, oh no, please don't tell me they made references even worse The thing is I actually hate references like in c++ So you telling me that they changed it? honestly sounds Kind of intriguing it kind of gets my my hopes up because Do you bring references work in c++ breaks the the semantic languages established in C? Because like the end sign is reversed of what it actually does also when you call a function with the references and arguments and then like the fucking function changes the value of your reference and It's like okay the value change but like how the fuck was I supposed to know that just from looking at the codes Like how did I how would I know that the function takes a reference? And that it is even possible for it to change my fucking value. Like what the fuck is going on? No, I don't know C sharp I honestly, I don't think there's that much difference between programming languages And then for the most part it doesn't matter which one you use I See sure again that you basically end up randomly moving lights around so that they're just another one Maybe a mercy on you not to buy some locations away That does sound mildly unpleasant But if you end up compiling in the end anyway in code on script, right, what's it what does it matter? The language reuses a when people compare Python to C++ when they're completely different things The Lord Fartamore who drew my proper picture I forgot his name Unless you're talking about the Yoshi with the sunglasses then that would be Zeno Oh my god, this is going to be such a pain to you be map. Oh fuck I Had honestly we finished part five And We finished part nine mostly got some good progress on part ten So what's missing is part 10 part 11 for 12? 13 No This is 10. This is 11. This is 12 This is very what the fuck is going on mushrooms each color we volcano Yeah, there's only three parts missing in this part of the old world So I will actually like three and a half. Yeah, we're almost done with the first art pass So that's very promising so we got one poopy side of the island and one decent looking side of the islands We So Saturday we probably have to work on the course to remake But we'll get there So I think I'm done now because me and Zeina we want to go to the beach still So I will see you guys next stream, which definitely is going to happen on Saturday I see you I see Yeah, okay, I will see you guys next time bye-bye
