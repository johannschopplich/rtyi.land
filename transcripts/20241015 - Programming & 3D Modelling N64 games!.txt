You you  My microphone doesn't work you are wrong. I can see it work Hello media power cut must have killed it. You are still wrong. I can see it work you you you Hello, Mario, Luigi You Wait a second I'm like, this is fine. I think yeah This should be good And We can't hear you. Yes, you can. What are you talking about? Maybe you can't maybe your death What OST do we pick today? Any OST wishes you're gonna trick me into thinking I'm deaf. Yeah, that's exactly my plan Hey, so talk to Mario doesn't actually need this this we already have that going on You What do you mean what are we talking about I can't hear you true Any next my system, but I absolutely expect to be more than 2,000 lines of code I guess with the shaman of the fine statements Wait, where do you see the fine statements? This no, that's not a defined statement the audio stuff fair You Don't submit my wetness OST. What the hell is that? And it's just one song we can't just listen to one song on repeat for two hours It upset stream edits, wait what? Hello, Ida's You You Hello Hans mayor, you just had to reload I see We can listen to the Mario Party for it was even if that's what we want No, that's nice player Rolo But even mind I'm I'm like a programmer I'm as a designer I'm like 7 out of 10 Right. So just because I say things doesn't mean they're necessarily true I Want to eat the font the font is nice, isn't it you guys seeing the new fonts? By a big made those textures and I made some problem changes to support this Yeah, that's new Just as the fun letters are If you look closely at the fun, you'll see that the font now is much less pixel a Then an RGB fit to do that it is What do you think You guys like it You get a animation. Yeah, I Just put the grindblur animation on did you not see it? How does it look on CRT, I'm not sure I Don't actually have a CRT plugged in right now Hello in Cetacea But yeah, I really like the Transparent pixels in the hut now gets a lot to it. Hello. There's a And it looks a lot less pixelated now And yeah, the new grind animation is into so if you look at it now Maurice doing this And when I press B, he kind of like beans down. I change the animation a little bit. So no It's like I already asked the Zainab to make a new icon by Mike. The current icon is completely temporary Now the icon we have here shit I Shaking like that. He's just crouching down when you press B and then going back up Did it look like he was shaking? Because if so, that's not intentional Either way today actually we're done with course one. Let me update my title Back to c14 Chicks from side to side a lot Ha that's not intentional. Oh, yeah, by the way, what did you think about my comment on this bridge here? I don't like this bridge. It's unfitting. I Think this should be something else I Said we probably just need to change the texture. I just think the texture is not fitting Ramps on the side I'm not sure what that means I Was just thinking of changing the texture so if it's more to the rest of bunny brush woods As in maybe like a wooden block bridge They're gonna see it's under the floating mushroom caps are rotating the wrong way really Yeah, you're right they're rotating the wrong way let me fix it real quick And look I'm shake I'm not right now, but I believe you I Should fix it, right? If you experience mercury through a flat plane, it's something do you not you're getting floor cocked probably There we go. I fixed us Yeah, so I think just having a new texture on this would already solve our issue I Look at the toast You make everything look fine on CRT when someone says it looks like the ocean I mean I just say well suppose you run on the meter Um, everything looks fine on a CRT Right whenever you want we can just look at this on real hardware I'm actually kind of curious what frame rates the new hard runs at anyway. Yeah That's not black, okay, we need a pipes and comment there I think I had same frame rate obviously No, it's still around 50 nice Sucks that the hut is doing this right now, but that's easily fixable You Well with my new movement function those are not an issue anymore, but obviously my source code is not released yet I Think the bridge looks great. The bridge is unfitting. It doesn't fit in the world that it's in That's the problem You But if we had this be like the inside of a tree That's just a cut and then the other stuff is the outside of a tree that's been cut. I don't know But like the line on here, I feel like is so unfitting I'm afraid I won't be happy with anything. That looks like a log Yeah, I don't know about this either still look spooky I Don't think this is in that I I Don't know how I never noticed before how shit the bridges it's just difficult to do something now to justifies being here I Something like this wouldn't look us out of character, I think What do you think just like a decent version of this texture I Do use this texture a lot Right now the lot yeah, of course I Do have a downscaled version of this ready spare don't skip and brightens  Don't keep on getting abuse noises are so funny I What you think That's great in the physical This is what you are thinking Some people are saying more saturated I Don't know about that like It's getting weird at some point They just look flat as fuck We can make it look less flat if we want with Right this adds a gradient to it But the dark parts are a different color or a different hue rather I Don't know why I did that I Think this is one can also compared to California looks like an image printed on the paper bridge. Yeah, I see what you mean  And something like this and now we have a lerp between two colors here going on. That kind of makes it look less flat I think. There's too many of them but I don't want to make that big a change. It's too dark now, is it not? Honestly, I don't think this is bad. This might also help with the flatness a little bit. Looks weird. Honestly, I prefer the previous one. To increase the contrast a lot. I mean, that increases the contrast. Let's see what we can do in photoshop. Okay, yeah, actually, yeah, this will work. I just realized, yes, because we have the combiner setup here, this will actually do something pretty cool. So this obviously looks stupid in photoshop, but once we have it in game, something very cool is going to happen. Is that what you were thinking? No, we got a subtraction. Okay, I know people sometimes give me shit for putting reworks of my level in, but would you rather just have the worst level? I think I much prefer this, to be honest. Just randomly spreading the red coins, there is no purpose to that. Why would someone want to do a mission that's just walk everywhere, idiot? You know what I mean? I don't know what that is. Looks transparent like skin. That's an interesting thought. Yes. No, I for sure prefer this. Yeah, I'm going to remove my note. Same thing I want for these blank registers, multiply, multiply, subtract and add actually. It's like this. Well, we also could have done something like this.  All right, let's finally get back to course 14. Our detour has been long enough. It's not just my game, you are helping a lot on it. It's just the the other texture just doesn't fit in the architecture, if you ask me. Maybe I'm not 100% sold on what we have right now either, but like, man. The old one is just way too unfitting. Doesn't fit the art shop. Yeah, fair enough. Maybe we need to find something in between both. I mean, I can look for more textures. Maybe I'll find something decent. It's just the one we had before just don't like it. Okay, so we were in this level. I think the last thing I did was add googly eyes to these guys here. I don't think I ever showed this on stream. They have googly eyes and they look at you. Oh, developing in a modern game engine is a lot slower. Like booting Unreal Engine takes minutes or compiling C++ code in Unreal Engine. We don't have a hub world. The hub world is going to happen at the very end. Did I ever show this stuff even on stream? I feel like I did this off stream and never showed anyone. I mean, you'd expect it to be faster, right? Because the game is so much smaller. These guys aren't beatable, by the way. They will ruin your life. It's kind of cool that you can just walk on here. All right, let's see where we were at with this level. We've got all the biomes done. Did I ever show you guys the songs for this level? This level has like five different songs that all play at different times. Depending on where you are. Let me just find my messages with Badoop. Oh my god, Badoop made so many new songs. This is for the mountainous area. There's three of the five you're talking about on Suncloud. Oh, he already uploaded them. Never heard of him. I did not know he uploads them to Suncloud so fast, but that is good. Well, that's one song, but the instruments fade into each other, depending on which area you walk to. Biobank, do you watch Northern Lion? I watched one of his videos recently and I thought, yep, this is Biobank. Never played either one of those two, Mika. But I know I hate Donkey Kong 64. Kizuma already did that, true. So we have Toad Doodle Star after castle platforming. You have the paper airplane going in a circle around the main area. Collect five silver stars mid-flight to win. Why would he be me? Dude, he does all these quizzes. All the words and stuff. And he's good with words. Like you can tell he's really, really good with words. It feels like it's actually Biobank. We got Legion's Grand Star models. We have inside the cardboard box, we have the Red Coins inside the pyramid. And we have Tibet Pipe. Dude, he just streams your night routine. That's like half a stream, I think. I don't know. I just watch the compilations. Course 1 is an MP3. Considering how much I analyzed Course 1, I should think about this one a little more too. Because it's like, what is the purpose of this level? I would say the purpose of almost all the levels is just to let you experience freedom and immersion at this point after the first one, which has to also teach you movement. And I think it does all that. The question is if any of the stars that we have do not add to this. And the Toad Star is good. That's like great platforming. The Crayon Star is very cute. Inside the cardboard box, like in here. Yes, that will also be nice. Red Coins inside the pyramid. Yes, that will also be nice. The Moray Pin area. Yes, that's fine. But the Paper Airplane going in a circle around the main area to collect 5 Silver Stars mid-flight. I don't know about that one. That feels a little pointless. Oh, also he plays the Binding of Isaac. That's also another thing. See a Mephisto. Isn't that how he got famous, the Binding of Isaac? And you modded that game? Or you translated it even? Like you were the official translator? Like, come on. Oh my god, I had no idea he's been streaming for that long. I just recently learned about him. The Paper Airplane will get you a view of the Bitcoin, but that won't be its only purpose. I think my issue with it is the fact that it is so stiff. I just had the idea randomly to follow. Other ideas I'm having right now is, what if there was a Wing Camp that only spawned during Act 6? And once you have that, you're free to fly over the entire level instead of the Paper Airplane. Maybe the Paper Airplane still exists, but it just shoots you over here so you can land here. So it would have a simpler purpose. And then on Act 6, you would have the Wing Camp available to you. And maybe there's a Timed Star. I think that would be really cool. Or a Cloud Camp, too. So basically, you would have had to do the rough traversal of this level the whole time. But then during the last Act, the whole level suddenly opens up because you have the Wing Camp. I think I much prefer that over the Paper Airplane. The question is just, what do we do with the Wing or the Cloud Camp? We also should be using our power-ups more. I'm sold on this idea. We're doing that. Sky Canary? Enough. Okay, he is literally me. Fair, you know what, fair. He's so funny. We get to go from papercloth to papercloth. Ah, I see what you mean. Wait a second, I'm just going to find out where I was. Oh my god. So the YoshiDoodle will tell you, but then we can't work out the YoshiDoodle tells you about hatbox-5-6. First question is, where do we actually put that? I kind of like it next to paper airplane. I would also kind of like it up here. So like, you can only get there with the paper airplane and then the YoshiDoodle tells you about it. This is also a great vantage point to start trouble from with the wing or cloud cap. I also love the contrast this gives you between normal gameplay and gameplay with the wing cap, because contrast is really what amplifies your feeling and by having a strong contrast between non-free and free parts, the freedom is going to feel more freedom, you know what I mean? How do you feel about the Typhlosion allegations? I have not looked at any Pokemon League and honestly, I don't care. I've heard that this is like random trivia they made up for like potentially to be put in one of the old games and they just didn't put it into the game, which means it didn't really happen. But if this is like a short story that they're planning to release or something, then maybe they should reconsider. Use the wing cap to get high and high on the paper clouds and then at the top cloud you get the wing cap, which will let you fly to the start at the top of the map on a paper sun or something. The sun is the lamp here, which by the way, it looks really dark for a sun, because the lighting is so not neutralized. Cloud cap first and then you get the wing cap, both caps? I don't want that. I just want one of them. And I do want the player to feel free here. That's the thing. We could do the sign hunt that we also did in course 12, where it tells you to a spot to go to and you go to that spot and you ground pound and you get like a thing. But it's going to be just spots that you can reach the wing cap. So like the first sign is going to be here. And then the next sign might be like here, where like you can't get without the wing cap. And then the next sign could be here. You know what I mean? So the little chase around the level. We would need an easier way to actually get to the wing cap then. Or we could just put multiple wing caps. It needs to be spots that the player is familiar with. Well, if we put this during Act 5, you've already been through Act 1, 2, 3, 4. And Act 1 is like here, Act 2 is here, Act 3 is like in this cave here. And Act 4 is inside here. So you would have gone over the entire level at that point, but there would be spots like this where you've seen them, but you couldn't get to them. And there will be a wing cap over the spot, right? We probably have to mark them as like secret spots. So like we would have X's marked on the floor and when you ground pound them, you get one secret. Something like that. And there would be another one here with a wing cap. So you would know that you need the wing cap kinda. Could be a landmark that you can only access with the wing cap. Yeah, exactly what I was thinking. Although there aren't very many landmarks that you can only access that way. There's also the issue that if it's only landmark you can only access with the wing cap, once you fall down once, you need to go the entire way again. Ball push pins to mark the spots. Wait. Ball push pins. Oh, yes. The blue white mountain from Yoshi's Island. Blue white mountain from Yoshi's Island. Oh, these. I mean, if you have a cardboard cutout of those, sure. That would be great. Of course, we do have the option to just. Honestly, kind of a banger. Kinda like it. It fits a little better color wise. Okay, we need to think of a way to make this not suck, because there's two options here. The first is it's places you can literally only reach the wing cap. The second it's places that you can always reach, but there are some places you can only reach the wing cap. And the problem is, if you cannot reach them without the wing cap, then if you fall down once you have to redo the whole thing, which would suck. The other thing is, if you can always reach them, what if you reach them before and now you're just in a spot where you can't do anything. And you don't know why you can't do anything. Because the wing cap box is just not going to be there. Yeah, exactly. That's the issue. Unless we literally just made the spots not spawn, unless you're an Act 5 or 6. You really like that song, huh? The problem is, if it's just like one manta rain or one airplane going somewhere, and you have to fly through it, it's going to be not feeling, the feeling of freedom is going to be gone, right? The great thing about the wing cap is that the wing cap now lets you move over the entire level without having to go through the entire platform fuckery, so you're going to feel much more free to just move anywhere. If we have a paper lane with manta ray rings that just flies in a circle and you just have to follow it, we don't have any of that feeling of freedom. It kind of loses it's purpose, I think. Maybe you can reach with the wing cap and leave a new wing plate. Yeah, I see why you're saying that. Yeah, but you are much more free in how you want to approach it. There's also the thing, okay, let's say the wing cap is here, and you have to go here and ground throw the spot, there's a cannon here. You can use the cannon to get wing cap momentum again and fly back or fly to the next spot or wherever you want. I think that's a much cooler feeling. What we could also do is, there could be a switch here, and once you hit the switch, a star spawns, let's say here, and you have x seconds to get back to it. So it's a little bit of a speedrun challenge and not a 5 of x challenge. What size does it need to be? Does it need to be greyscale? It needs to be 16x16 and it should be an intensity alpha 8 texture. Okay, someone will tell me to calm down, Lila, and we'll all be fine. I can have something to make going back a bit easier. Well the cannon is here, so you can just go to it. And then there's also a cannon here, so you have two cannons. The cannon is this. That would be very cool, but I just made one out of cardboard. Speed Challenge Chain is the free feeling. I mean, with the cannon being here, once you have the wing cap once, you can just always go back up here. You can fire confetti when you should at least. Fine, that's a cool idea. The cannons should fire confetti as well. What's another place you can only reach with the wing cap? We probably have to add new places, which I don't really like. Yeah, that's the idea, Mika. No, no, you don't actually need a wing cap. See, this cannon here is used to shoot to this castle, and this cannon here is used to shoot here. So there's genuine uses for the cannon. It's just as soon as you have the wing cap, you can use the cannon to go other places as well. The wing cap opens everything up. Yeah, the only problem I have right now is that there's very few places where you can actually only reach with the wing cap. We could have a silver star here and one here. That's two places. Then the problem with you put one here is you can reach it without the wing cap as well. Most of them do that, man. My 64 lens 100% reward is my favorite. The whole game is played as though it was a movie shot, and then in the end you get behind the scenes with the actors. We could add one of these hills for a third silver star that has three of them. We could have a silver star just like randomly floating in the air here, but it would have to be somewhere very obvious where you see it. Talon Pearl Mushroom instead of five silver stars. If anything, I would add one individual mushroom somewhere. Because we already have one, two, and then with the hill you have three spots. Then we just need two more. And really, we have a lot of options here. I don't think that is necessary. I should see how it feels to use the wing cap here. You can just rip through with the cannon. That would be great and fitting somewhere. Oh, yeah. Would you think to shoot at it? And why would you shoot at it? How do we set that part up? Who is it? Maybe he is good enough by himself. Oh, it is a literal target. I see what you mean. Oh, okay. Yeah, that is actually a great option. If we need the player to shoot to a very specific location. I don't think that we need the player to do that anywhere, though. That is a nice option to keep in mind in this level, but I think the level is too far along to do that right now. Oh, there is also the thing. If you actually target the target, you are going to shoot below the target. Because cannons shot some nice things with gravity. Hello, Schattengewecks. That is the wrong level. Wow, I really thought the camera would follow your pitch a little bit. This camera is totally wrong. I don't like this camera at all. The hell? 5p, but I got it. I can see me to shoot through. That would be cool. I think I like that, yeah. That is better than Silver Stars. Why is the camera so shit? I need to debug this. I can't do it with this camera. I like this camera, you are wrong. It doesn't activate the camera. Oh, I see. This should be a lot better. I don't think we want to make it so you need the cannon shot to fly through the paper targets. But we will make it so that you get an advantage. Or that makes it easier. I don't know. This is so much easier to control. Hello Innovator. Do you think he will benefit from another B- No. I don't use BDSF materials ever. Just like the modeled COD rooms from Banjo-Kazooie have BDSF textures, but like... It's not like you can get anything from them anyway. There's something weird going on here still. And a lot. Okay. Yeah, but not in the Banjo-Ribs, so I don't care. Yeah, there is a few issues with the camera I noticed as well. It doesn't seem to go down correctly with you. Flying cameras, we can turn this down a little bit. Why is this condition auto-rotated? Sure. Is there anything actually interesting in the leaks? The only interesting thing in the leaks that I've heard so far, and I haven't actually looked at the leaks, but the only interesting thing I've heard is all the cool features that the Pokemon models have, that Game Freak just never made any use of. It just goes to show that Game Freak is complete dogshit to me. Completely mismanaged piece of shit. I think that's interesting. Why does auto-rotate always turn itself off here? That's the issue. It just keeps turning auto-rotate off. Hello, voicer. Someone gifted my child a language learning book and it teaches you French. Now I have to listen. Well, right now, luckily the child is too young to play with it, but I'm sure in like half a month I'll have to listen to it. Le Caton Gros Mare tells you a bunch of animals and body parts. I will soon know how to threaten people to break their body parts in French. Le Caton. I actually forgot what the name for cat was. And Le Corpse is just a French word for body, I think. Crazy. Are you scared that Nintendo will attack your project? Nintendo should be scared I attack headquarters. Sorry. Le Caton Gros Mare. Take this on project and take down the building. Exactly. While auto-rotate on, the camera is beautiful. And then sometimes it just goes off like that. Epic, yes. Why are we clamping the tilt like this? What the fuck was that? Hello, Lera. I have not imported your guys in the game yet, but the files exist on my hard drive and it will happen eventually. We just were distracted reworking course one again for a couple months, weeks. There we go. You didn't see yesterday, right? No, I tried to stream on Saturday, but my whole electricity went out because of the thunderstorm. Oh, the new numbers look weird. I don't like them. It was your birthday. OK, let's sing happy birthday. Oh, yes, baby Lera. Actually, no, I only like singing happy birthday for people if it makes them more embarrassed than me. But like she's not on camera. I was not embarrassed case. Well, yes, that's the issue. I got a serious question. All right. I have a serious answer. Happy birthday, Lila. Did I sing happy birthday for you? My friend has been in your inbox for over a year. What's that about? Do you see this, this discard thing here? I have. Let me just take a screenshot of this. I can't see any friend requests. There's way too many for me to look at. I can't accept your store if I find you. That's message requests. Oh, that's you. All right. I have accepted you. I don't have a favorite Mario 64. I think they are cringe. OK, targets are good. Yeah, we want something simpler. They have a favorite Lila. There's like five different dailies. All right. I can't pick one of you guys because the other four would murder me. I like this one. We should put this one in red. OK, yeah, we got the same idea. I was thinking this in red. I like this one.   How do we put the thing around it? Obviously, we don't just want to put something in the air. We put it on like a thin stick. Like target on a stick. Something like this, I guess. I was thinking like a wooden board around it. And then the target's in the middle and you go through it and it like rips. CMC character controller. Is that the new movement component that they're making? If so, yes, I'm excited for it. Because the one they have right now, I don't like it. Dude, Unreal Engine's collision has no back face culling. Can you believe it, dude? That is fucked up. Bubble blower? Oh, I see what you mean, yes. Like this. They are cool. This with the target inside. But we want it to be able to rip, so it needs some tension. Dude, I haven't seen one of these in years. I forgot this was a thing. Do we want it white or with a color? I think white is easier to make work. I played Pangaea Deluxe when he was a child. The fuck? What? What kind of joke is that? Can we hack all of them? Every single one? You just need to be good at hacking. I'm still thinking of making the Mr. Least video. I hacked every N64 game in one day. And then you will see all the games that can be hacked. I'm actually thinking. I don't like Pokemon without the modern EXP share. So I'm just going to make a Pokemon hack in that video. And the Pokemon hack is just going to be Pokemon with the EXP share. And then I'm just going to be like. There is a Game Boy emulator on the N64. So this counts. I think it's fair enough. Dynamo Crossing. What? Are you making Bubble Blower? Honestly, the amount of effort I will put into that video. Will be way lower than actually making a Golden Eye hack or anything like that. It will be like the simplest possible hack I can make. Unless it's something I've already made. Yeah, I don't know why I did all the sides individually at first. That was a severe lapse in judgment. Looks like a Bubble Blower to me, does it not? And then we have the target in there. Actually, it doesn't look like a Bubble Blower at all. It just looks like a thing that holds a target up. We might need a better justification for this existing. This is an aligned path. If you do align the angle in and angle out, it won't be the same. Because maybe they would be, I don't know. But this is safer. Not like this took long anyway. But I'm not a fan of this anyway. I don't think this is convincing looking. If you put ridges, it will look like a... Okay. I need like a 3D model of a Bubble Blower. Or like a 3D viewport rather. Does no one have like a normal one? Hmm. Please, just a normal Bubble Blower. What does the backside look like? Bubble won't. Okay, so both sides have ridges. So, this is probably a bad idea. Like this. Cool. What if I do this and add ridges to it? I think that should do it. Those poor kids. Why? What happened to the kids? Okay. I think this is good, maybe. We just need a ridge texture. Okay. Actually, I do want lighting in here. I feel like the music is gonna make me go insane. Are you missing any other assets? A paper airplane? If you wanna make a paper airplane, that would be awesome. There is going to be a paper airplane that you shoot with a rubber band into the pyramid. You doing it? Very nice. Looking forward to that. Do you think we can do like a graph paper? A texture for that. That would be awesome. And yes, you did give me all the noodles for this level. It's got like a metallic texture, does it not? I don't know what I think about that. Like a metal texture with little wheels. At the end of every slide there's a special diamond, collect all the diamonds first so you can slide level. Sonic. Are you writing rap verses in my chat or is it a suggestion for my game? Yeah, just like a standard folded paper airplane. Just like how you would do it. That's just not very good. Small paper airplanes would be funny. That's true. This level performance wise it's going to be a bit of an issue though I think. Let me actually take a look. Do you have anything origami to say? No, I don't want origami. I want this to be like Amataro's craft. Okay, the performance here obviously has some issues, but considering we didn't optimize anything at all yet, it's actually decent. Like, given the conditions, this works well. I also need to fix the text in the menu and the FPS counter here, clearly. Insane idea. Paper fort should tell a random plant. Did you random generate that one? Where is this coming from? Paper fort should tell a random plant. Oh, I see what you mean. Yes. Okay. Yes, yes, yes. Are the Chubby Chai guys? They're thimbles. No, this is an awesome idea. We could put them all over the place too. They could just like spawn out and attack you. I'm going to note that down because that's very cool. And I'm glad if you make it too, otherwise I won't make it. Paper fort should tell a piranha plant. He wants a piranha plant in his level that tells you your fortunes? What? And then it's dead. You want to burn up and give the plants? But no, this makes sense. Do you have a graph paper texture? Nope. But surely it's easy to make one. Most textures are 64 by 64. So that's likely what you should do. If you can do 16 colors or no colors at all, then 64 by 64. If you need more than 16 colors, then 32 by 64. French Jackal chickens. I don't see the resemblance to a chicken. The only origami I can make is a boat. But I can make an origami boat. Oh, and of course a paper airplane. I can make an airplane. I think this works. Paper boats. We could have some down here, but I'm a bit worried that the players are going to jump on it, thinking they can stand on it. And we also can't just have them floating in the air. This level is a bit in a problematic spot because so many of these effects are like kinda expensive. It's mostly the overdraw that's expensive. Well, actually, let's solve a few of the overdraw problems and see how much the performance gets cheaper. As I am actually at this point, I'm a little bit worried about the performance. I'm clairvoyant. But no, it's not actually a fortune teller. The toy is just called a fortune teller. It I can absolutely animate it to snap in both directions. If we want that. Your fortune is pain. You already know you will suffer for the rest of your life. Fair enough. background while working myself on stuff. That's cool. Standard airplane. That's a pretty standard airplane. I like it. Man, the Mario Kart OST took a wild turn. Is this already better? I can't tell. I feel like it already is significantly better, but I'm not sure. It will also be another significant chunk better once we have the floor reeled in to be where the mountains start. And also once we cut the floor so that everything doesn't override it. We still need to sort the materials. Man, I really don't think this mountain looks good. It's a cool effect, but like. Maybe the styrofoam effect is not where it's at. I guess we'll also have nice. I will take a look at that in a bit. After this, yes, after this, there's only one course left. That is correct. This is like 5000 triangles, so I guess that is a little bit of an issue. It's like 1600 triangles I can easily cull. How much is this? 600 triangles I can easily cull. Yeah, most of the big elements are just going to be culled. I think this level will be just fine. No, I think part one genuinely has the final rework done now. We've analyzed it enough. And there's also still the biobank rework for this level, which somehow every time biobank reworks the levels, he improves the performance despite adding a shit ton of stuff. It's just a bubble blower we're thinking of. But that's true. But I mean, even then there's like, oh, there's duplicate textures here, or there's textures here that we don't need, or there's a few polygons you missed. Or this actually looks like shit and I have a lower poly idea on how to make this look better. That happens all the time. Ugh, jpeg. It's a bit thin on the second one, it makes me anxious. You'll be fine. Don't have a panic attack, it's just a texture. It's just a 3D model, it can't hurt you. Fuck. Are there any cross themes ideas that got dropped? Yes, there's plenty. Is this what we're thinking? Are we gonna have bones animated? Yes! What I was thinking is there would be a static version of this model, and an animated version of this model, and as soon as you hit it, it swaps to the animated version of the model, and then after the animation is done, it swaps to a static model again. So you're gonna have three models, and then one model just kind of pops in during the animation, and it's expensive. That's exactly what you suggest, perfect. Yep, like this, I think it works. And I think we should have Vertex Colors on here. Do you think Watt could ever run this one without art? Yeah, whatever, true. So if I'm gonna call it Cast Shadows, it would definitely look better. Can I try to give the model a skeleton if that's cool? You can try it, but there is about a 99% chance you will do it wrong. Because of Laurie64 hacking stuff. You wanna do the Terra Biomech? You have a good idea for it? I can just kind of program the model swap for now, then. If that's what you want. Yes, that's one of the many restrictions, Leyla. You can do a circle guide to make a perfect circle attached to the frame with wires, kind of like a trampoline. Yeah, that would look a lot better. We have to make sure that this is exactly symmetrical, so that no matter which direction you fly through it, it opens in the right direction, because I can just turn it on Something like that. What are the others if I may ask? The bones have to all point straight up with no roll. Vertices can only be attached to a parent and not to a sibling. Those are like the main ones. I put Scaleneo's face. Unfortunately, he's not relevant enough. See, if I google Scaleneo's face, Google says skeleton face. Scaleneo's face. There just isn't any. I don't know how, when I google Scaleneo's face, Mario64's face shows up, but that's interesting. Keep in mind, Chris15 is actually already halfway done, because I have a lot of assets already in there. Personalized chance results? Honestly, probably. Let's take a look at Lero's file here. Let's take a look. I know Lero now, don't worry. Did you correctly fold this too? No, that's not correctly folded. This is not how a folded paper airplane would look like. You get the shape right, but the folds are not right. Am I stupid? How can I not find one? There's no way it looks like that! No! What is this? That's just not how it would look like. Why, Google? Is this AI generated by BixDoc? BixDoc wants you to think paper airplanes look like this. I'm about to just get a piece of paper myself and make one. Do I have a piece of paper lying around? I'm making a paper airplane to look at it. I'll be right back. I can't stand this. I'm making a paper airplane to look at it. I got a piece of graph paper. It's okay. Zermatt, Siemens, Stoker... Which direction do you fold the paper airplane to? I've always folded parallel consolidation as a child. My hand doesn't work correctly. Which way do you fold? Well, I'm making this one here. The one that's on my screen. This is the shape I'm going to be making in the end. But you do fold this way, right? Vertical. Alright, that's what I thought. No? No?  I'm gonna get this exact folding. Hello Skylark, we're making a paper airplane. That's why it's using math paper. Because I want the exact... I want the UV map. Just subdivide the plane and rotate it. You are absolutely right about that. Alright, let's do that. We're actually gonna do origami in my 3D tool here. At first I thought I was just gonna build a base out of this. But no, this is actually just easier. This is... The side ratio is 1.618. So... That doesn't seem right. There's no way these are the dimensions of paper. Is there? Actually, it does look kind of right. What is he doing? He's making a paper airplane. So you fold like this. 21... Yeah, exactly. So 1.618. What's wrong with the exact... Lila, have you ever seen a paper airplane? Sorry. Getting too excited about this. Well, this texture is also improvable. So... Something like that. Lady Gaga is part of the Game Freak Leagues.  I had not heard of that before. So this is 448 meters. So this is one fold you do, correct? Yoshi's font is starting to look good. Is he using Biobank's font? That actually does look pretty nice. Have you seen Biobank's font, Lila? Okay, so next you fold this one here and this one here. It's a real Biobank. All right, Lila, I'll show you the hardware right now. You see it? What are you thinking? And then you have a second fold that makes this go over here, right? So we need the length of this. Square root of 448. 1 by 448, 1 by 2. 633. Okay. All right, so if you fold this over... Let me simulate this on real paper real quick just to make sure I'm not doing it wrong here. So we have this fold here and then next we have the secondary fold which builds on the first fold. We use the first fold as a control line and it goes... What is the length of that triangle? What is the length of this side here? Should I just estimate it? Lila! That is in fact doing it, yes. Estimate that. Purely there's a mathematical formula we can use to figure this out, right? It's a 22.5 degree angle, right? So take this... Is it 22.5 degree angle or is it a 4? That's a 45 degree angle. Is this the sine of 45 multiplied by 29.7? Is this the sine of 45 multiplied by the length of this whole thing? No, it's not. Is it the sine of 45 divided by the length of the side? See, I'm an empath. I can just kind of understand paper like that. Sine 45... Degree... Well, I would be divided by that, right? Am I losing it? That doesn't make any sense. Why would it be that? What is this? We know this is a 45 degree angle and we know it goes until it hits this. Which means... We're moving at a 45 degree angle for the duration of this length divided by the ratio of the angles, right? A squared plus B squared equals C squared? Okay, who cares? How does that help us? We know A, but we don't know C or B. But we know the length of this and there's no way this is a 45 degree angle. It has to be 22.5. And then it has to be a divide. Right? 1170? That looks right to me. I think it's here. Can you just use the following pretty straightforward guide? Yeah, but why would I estimate it when I can compute it with math? If you thought about that. Okay. Okay. So the next fold is this side onto this side. Please don't ever create a computer paper planes with math. It's so over for her. She's gonna have to, bro. I have a question. Do you guys think we can mirror this? I know it sounds really fucking stupid at first, but think about this. The UV map is not symmetrical, not necessarily. Actually. Oh, no, it really isn't. Actually, maybe kind of. It's like one or two millimeters on the paper, but we can fix that. We can make it a one or two millimeters offset here, too. Don't worry, boys, we got this. I'm just gonna use a mirror modifier for now. And then we're gonna just offset the UV map at the very end. Okay, and then the last cut is pretty easy, right? We just need, we just need this here. Of course, that's not how you make them. How would you make it? That kind of doesn't look good. What the fuck does he mean by offset by 0.7, this is unrealistic garbage? No, but it is what it is. Oh, the last cut, the last cut is this, right? You do this on the side, so it has to be, this has to be rotated. This has to be right in the middle of the wing. I need this. This anus is going to help me rotate this. Except now, slow down the rotation of the camera and blender. Beautiful The UV map is wrong. There's no way the UV map should look like that. Okay, but we need to simplify the model anyway, because there's a lot of unnecessary triangles right now. This still gives us a nice base to work with. Don't say that. Two, three, four, five, six. Okay, if I look at this, some of this seems right. So, this needs to be, these need to be aligned, these three UV vertices, so that this line here exists, but these might need to be down and to the right. Yeah like that. Did someone hurt you? Why? I think somebody will have to spend anything, what the fuck, yes, yes they will. That doesn't mean you have to make a paper airplane and get handed the OVJ, yes. And then, perfect. Look man, don't you think the fold looks beautiful? Don't you think this was worth the effort? Look at this beautiful fold. It looks just like a real paper airplane now. You can't tell me this doesn't make you nostalgic. It would be really cool to get the plane folded in real time for this animation somehow. Don't say that. We're not doing that. Nope. Fuck you. What's wrong Leila? Is this not like a completely normal game stream for you? Alright, now for the texture. I think we can add a bit of film grain to this. Ahahaha, Leila. Ahahaha. Ahahaha. Ahaha. Then I turn on blue. Yeah. Give it a bit of like a paper feel as well. Oh my god Leila. I don't know if it will be fun. It's the only thing I've ever done. Alright, and then we can add some shape to this cycle here. And then I think we've got it. Why is it purple? Heh. Heh. This is weird. Did you fix the fuck bug? Which one? Not sure what you're talking about. Why is it not seeing texture one color? Oh, I'm not sure if that's fixed Leila. Oh, I see. It might be fixing it. I haven't seen the bug in a while, but I also have not worked on the level of Fawken a bit. Should we be doing insane stuff like strip clubs? Strip clubs is the most insane thing ever. You really want to just be sitting there with your boys having bonus? That's weird as shit. Don't you think so? Has anyone here actually been to a strip club before? No shame, just admit it. I will not be shaming you for it. You have? How was it? It was nice. These dudes were hot. Women going to a strip club has a completely different energy to men going to the strip club. That's true. Excellent gamer. Interesting Leila. Why would I go to a strip club when I could go to a group and get excellent results? Yeah, but Biobank, you're missing out on the experience of sitting with your boys and having a bonus together. Leila, what's going on? It's not doing the thing. Texture 1 is completely missing. Is he a render? Oh. Eyyyy. Fair point. This graph paper is a little too intensely blue, but... I think it's getting there. Nope, I had no idea. Yeah. I think the second texture is a bit too dark. That looks cool as fuck. Boys will look at that and go hell yeah. Alright. There we go. I love this paper airplane now. I think it looks great. Are the lines in blue and pink everywhere in the world or just friends? Oh, the lines on graph paper. That honestly wouldn't make a lot of sense if they were blue and pink, but... These are like... Like 3-0, 3-0, 5-0 maybe? Kinda like that, yeah. It's pretty close. There we go. There we go. It's honestly a mooch. Let's see what you sent me. I don't know why, but you relate with the screenshot. I don't understand. I'm so confused. When's the last time you had a club where people watched you speedrun video games? I don't think anyone would come. It does kinda look like that. I don't think I need to make any further modifications to this. We got this as well. Alright. We just need the targets now and the paper plane. And then this mission can be programmed. Pretty happy with that. I think I'm good for today though. Sure, Layra, I can do that. I'll just wait for Layra's model before I end up done. Let's see what Layra got for us. I can already think about the locations of these. We definitely want one right by the thing. We should have one on the way to the castle. Maybe one on the way to the cannon here. Then one could just be random here, because that's where you can fly with the wing cap. And then maybe one here. That would be perfect, I think. Easy. Let me actually save this in my folders here. Okay. Interesting. We have to think about what the materials here would be made out of. Do we want this to be like silly straw or something? Just like a straw? Or what is it? Should it just be like a plant on the floor? Do we make it the color of a plant? Yeah, that would be perfect. Not sure if we can do the leaves on top of that, but yeah. That's probably what we'll do. Either way, I think I will be seeing you guys next stream then. Bye bye!
