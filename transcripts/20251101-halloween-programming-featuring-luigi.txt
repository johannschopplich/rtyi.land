And a cap out of second 64, yes, there's four of those. There's the wing cap, just like in Mario 64, because it's goated. There's the ice cap, which is like in Mario Galaxy, except you can't shoot ice. And there is the bomb cap, which lets you throw bombs. And there is the cloud cap, which lets you spawn clouds. The coin that I showed is not something that appears in secret levels, it is something that appears wherever I want. Or what do you mean by these coins? Each side level has exactly one star, no exceptions. Okay, we can load this down now. Let's import five, it's a plus. What's not imported yet... The metal cap I vanished, no, we don't want those, because they suck. Could it be rare coins? Yes, they're following PPR, I think. I'm not sure, actually. I programmed it so that if you collect a coin, it sends a bit in the EEP file, and then the next time you see it, it just spawns a small coin. But that was a big PPR coin right there. That's gonna be so funny, like, people will find one of those secret coins in a place, and they'll collect it, and then save the game, and then they'll tell their friends, look, look, I found a secret coin, and they go there again. Please, get trolled! And when people play this game, three years down the road, just send them the video of me going get trolled. Oh my god, I'm looking forward to that. Anyway, time to program the koi. So the koi will swim randomly to a bunch of different points here, they will generate positions around those points, and they will try to follow each other. And if you have saved the kois, then if you're near the middle island, or if you swim near them, they will go in a circle. I think that's the idea. Let's get some points. Coin color generator. We don't need the coin color generator anymore, but I still would like to preserve it. Okay, there's no point in reading this, I'm gonna mention this, that we have to run through a bunch of crates in a row as fast as we can to reach a star. Yes, but aren't there better ways to do a race star like that? Like Koopa the Quick? The missing is true, we programmed the long gates, and now we're programming the koi fish. We need to run through random spots sometimes, to generate a line of spots, we need to add the koi fairly quickly, and they aren't swimming anywhere near here right now. Plus line of sights, line of sights should always be important here. Koopa the Quick in some levels. We have the three musketeers of speed, which are like racing Koopas with cappies and their dude bros, chilling on a beach. And we have one janitor Koopa who dreams of being a Koopa racer, but no Koopa the Quick. Mario is on a little island, and the koi have been saved, apparently swimming in a circle. And in the crap of some menus, relatives stay away from the crab. Okay, that's actually a fairly complicated behavior here. Not looking forward to the small crab ordeal. In fact it's so annoying that it makes me double guess the crab thing, oh no! Maybe there's something else you can do to help the fish. See, a weird streamer ringing it up in here, thank you for the bits, for the money kakideff! Was that kakideff? I think it was. Looked like kakideff. Right, so the original plan was a crab appears eventually, and it starts biting at the fishes. And you just ground pound it, and that would give you a star. That seems like a way too simple way to get a star actually. If you do a hundred circles around the star, where the boo level is, you can play as Luigi afterwards. Ah, fuck. I did it again. This is why I always put decals on a separate layer usually. Hmm, kinda fixed it. What sounds annoying to- oh. Life, I think your message got deleted by Twitch automatically. I wouldn't be scared of GCC. GCC is my good friend, huh. Nah, that would imply that Yoshi is for fishing, and I don't like that. Maybe we can simplify the crab a little bit. I also want the crab to be more than just ground pounded ones. I think that would be lame. If it's a full star, there needs to be a little more than just ground pounded ones. No. I mean, yes I can, but I've gotta... Okay, definitely we go with the crab. Let's just say we go with the crab. Eventually it just comes up the river. Eventually you'll just randomly get here, and you see the big crab here, trying to catch the fish, and the fish swim away from the crab. And maybe the crab is like in the middle here. So, you would have to jump on the crab, you do a ground pound on it. The crab hates that. And then maybe the crab starts chasing you, and you have to fight it somehow. How would we best fight a crab? Roshi sushi for the Yoshis? Sounds good. Yeah, it didn't make them alive, but... The number's four, and don't worry about it. They mean nothing. Oooooohhhh. Escape the level after ground pounding the crab once? Nah, that'd be way too easy. But I also don't want the crab to run around everywhere. Kazzy is still doing debug prints and physics updates. Yes. Where else would you do that? The crab would have to stay in the water. And I don't think it should go beyond the bridge after you ground pound it once. Probably needs like a distance attack. But a fight feels so unfitting here in the village now, that we don't have the kamek fight. We could do something silly like you stand here and it hurts the shears on the rocks. Hello Nintendo for life. But that's way too counterintuitive and no one would ever think to do that. I'm not doing that. The physics interpolation never showed a broken Mario. If anything, that was the graph threads reading temporary data. And that doesn't happen anymore. At least it hasn't happened for a long time. Seems that the coin in the net and some old Yoshi beads are here to save the secret fish. And they show you the way. That could kind of work if all the fish were just randomly gone eventually. And you saw someone fishing over there. What if you saw the crab fishing over here? And it had the fish in the net. And then the fight happens over here. That would make it a lot easier. It's gonna be a little darker in different shadings like this in the later versions of the expansion. I think these numbers were taken directly from Mario 64. Somehow. Luigi might be temporary, he might be permanent. We have yet to see. But there's a good chance he's permanent. I'm just not really sure yet whether it's like you unlock him at the end or whether there's a full-on multiplayer. What would be the most evil thing is if there is a multiplayer but you have to unlock it by beating the game once. God, I hate when games do that. I think that generally would make the game worse for many people. They would be like, I hate this. It might, Jordan, we'll see. Alright, I think if we have the crab fight it should be here. The question is, what is the crab fight gonna be? It's like a 3D model of these guys but really big. Or it could be a gang of crabs. If it's a gang of crabs. Do you just beat all the crabs? What if they just have to fish corn out? And you ground pound the crab and it just kind of falls apart. And retracts into its shell like a turtle. Would crabs do that? Would they retract into their shell like a turtle? So the fish are in the middle, the crabs are around. You ground pound one, it retracts into its shell. Maybe you have to ground pound them all within a time limit to get them all into their shells. And then, that's a decent star I think. Maybe after you ground pound the first one they disperse and try to attack you. That should work. Yep, I think that's what we'll do. Let me add that to the behavior here. Hermit crabs? Wait, hermit crabs? Well it wouldn't be hermit crabs, it would be evil crabs. Do I have to ground pound all the crabs? Exactly! If you take too long and they go back out of their shell like a koopa. That's what we might have to do. I think normal crabs should also be able to retreat into their shells. How many peglegs would a pirate crab have? That's a good question. Maybe it should have all of them be pegs. Maybe it's because you just moored them to death khaki death. If you thought about that, maybe it's your breath. Could you Zeppelin Ranger her from other games? There aren't really any N64 era games with a good Luigi voice. Especially not enough to make a Mario 64 voice cover. There's a very good chance we would have a voice actor try to remake the Mario Kart 64 voice. Or maybe one of the Mario Parties. Is it the same? Mario Party is like, Yahoo! And Mario Kart is like, Fire! You know what I mean? The Mario Kart one is way deeper, right? Am I crazy? I have not run the game on a handheld device, no. I don't know if Tennis or Golf have any decent voices either. I don't know. I don't know. Probably a good amount of points. What I've found is that the right Megaclaw is a saber that's tied on with a rope as a prosthetic. I like the idea of a saber claw, but I'm not sure if he should be holding a sword. Just because it would make hitboxes a bit more complicated. Is the Mario Party 3 voice deeper too? Oh, okay. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Hmm, just use a starflag for that. Would you darken this green a tad? The green in the party game is pretty solid. A little neon at the moment. I'm not gonna mic around just Luigi's model until we have his full purpose defined. It would be inefficient time-wise, potentially. I love cheap Chinese fonts. They are often just way too good. Way more good than would be reasonable. I can just... Oh, there's a message for you. I do. To incomplete type constrajectory aka short int. What the fuck? Oh, it's not extern with size. That's so dumb. Okay, well, I guess. This is why I thought I had to do it. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Does this make sense? If you demote it with 1, you only get 0, right? And if you do it with 2, you get 0 and 1. So... I need to actually... Do this. All right. Now with 0 points, we get 1. With 2 points, we get 2. I'm going to show you how to do this. Either they want to clean it up a lot or they don't care that much about the project. I do think they are attempting to clean it up a lot. I think they almost wanted to... Actually, I don't know how much I can say. But I'm fairly confident that it's a good project. Oh, we already defined this before. I see. Okay, let's reuse those. Wait, we should do something different. Let's do this, plus more. And then... Following fish. Reject of this fish is already following us. I did release the Mario 64 Mario Kart Discovery Recon recently, that's surprising. That is enticing. Glory to the CCP, I've always said it. Oh, it's just part of one. The game runs fine on the Ico player right now. Jinjo, or however their name is, help me make sure that works. It works with the same ROM too, it just builds a ROM that works on NTSC and China. And it's not byte matching that you can't guarantee it works the same, so you should care about byte matching. We need like a fish array here. How do we best implement this? Bring in an array of fish, for all five fish. Something like this. And then, how do we populate this array first? We could do it on level begin, we could do it with the texture anims thing. I'm a bit worried that this runs before texture anims runs, which actually is not really a big worry. We could go by object list order, which is a little slower, but should be fine. Okay, let's do that. Byte matching is hard? Not byte matching might be harder. I think intelligence just doesn't work very well at all. I don't know what to do about it. I don't know what to do. Should be fine. Okay, ctrl H is the end of non-void function. I guess I'll be so charitable and return 0. Just crash. Search. There we go. I think other people have gotten intelligence to work. I had it working, and then it broke. I had it working, and then it broke. Actually, we need to check line of sight on every frame here. Unless we only do this once. You know what? Let's only do this once. Just to make my life a little easier. Let's do this. Actually, fuck this. It doesn't even save any instructions. Let's do this. Okay, fair enough. Given up on LSP. What's that? Fancy acronym that means intellisense. Okay, time for the line of sight check. I've done this before. I should have the exact code somewhere. We definitely do that for this. Let's just do that. Does this even work? Aren't we supposed to provide a direction? Am I crazy? This is supposed to provide a direction. But it's not doing that. This code doesn't work. Okay. I've been doing LST lately. Okay. Annoying. But again, this is technically Markimoo anyway. So I don't care that I have to do this. It's good to have a hobby. Okay, first check. Does it instantly crash when we enter the level? Or freeze wrap? No. Good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Do the fish have the flag? Nope. Might as well put them on now. And then... We should back this up. Okay. No. It should be this. This is what we'll do. Less than slowdown cutoff. Action equals three. We go to zero here. Actually, now that I think about it, I want this to be bigger. And now that I think about this, I also... Okay, we have that. And then opacity equals 16%, maybe like 50. No base. Oh, China. This is what we'll do. 7k stream? Yes, correct. 3517 is an issue. We should now have fish that swim around relatively smoothly. Some will chase each other. And go all over the place. Crazy, we'll just try. They aren't doing shit. Wait, are they doing shit? They are doing shit. Just very, very slowly. We got fish. They don't look smooth at all. Why are they so slow? Because we didn't set the physics. This should already do a lot. Now, one thing I don't like about this is that the velocity is static. I think that should also be randomized. Oh, velocity. Are they supposed to be floating on top of the water? Did I put them all on top? Oops. I can fix that real quick. Now they are in the water. Okay. Raw data, what? Okay. So it's randomized over time or just on spawn? They start swimming, their velocity is randomized. It looks semi-okay. They are exploring, which is good. I got all those coins and my herons. Yep, that's why I'm in that over my pond. Those herons will empty your pond in like a day. That guy is stuck. He got himself stuck somehow. That sucks. Two? Wait, two died? Sorry, what did I miss? Oh, shit. Okay, that would be a problem. Let's see this again. I made them a lot faster now. They look so un-elegant. Oh, yeah, one got stuck there. I'm really not a fan of how non-elegant they look. They should turn in a smoother way. Something like this. And yeah, them getting stuck is a big problem. Why do they get stuck? Herons turn you blind if you're aggressive in front of them for no reason. I don't know, is this a reference to something? What is undulating? Well, yes. They need animations, they're not animated. This is correct. Do I have given them the bones to do like a fishy movement? They're goldfish. Okay, yeah, they don't have the bones to actually look very elegant here, which is a bit of a problem. 0-2. Animating fish is more involved than you would think. Most games get it wrong. Huh. I don't know, given that I have fish, I feel like there shouldn't be too many problems with this. I don't know what does Anest want animating, but I feel like she's seen fish enough. Oops, I ruined their patents. Easy fix though, don't worry. Okay, I think one way we can make them look more elegant is if we do some stuff to the angle weld jaw here. And that is... Angle diff equals... Angle at cell equals... Angle at cell equals... Angle at cell equals... Angle at cell equals... I think with something like this we can fake it well enough. G current object undefined. Huh? What have I done? Oh. Huh. I think the sound redesign looks pretty good so far. I guess? But they have nice butterfly thingies. Yeah, perfect fish, nice. This is exactly what we wanted. Oh. Oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh. 0x98F? I didn't even know you could do that. That's a typo. They're still doing... They're still doing O E E R E O E E R E. Okay. Maybe something wrong here. This is the same product, right? Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Is this just too small of a factor? Am I not dividing by too high enough of a number? 16 feels like a lot already. Oh. Fucking duh. Why did no one tell me I was using min and max wrong? You know what I never understood? Why people say PEMDAS. What the fuck. PEMDAS? Why is it six letters? You just do multiplications before additions. Like what? How is that six letters? School? It's even worse because of how brain-rotted people are about it. I've seen a viral math problem. 1099 minus 1 plus 2, what is it? People are like, oh you have to do the plus first. So actually you subtract 3 from 1999 and you get 1996. Bro, what? You know what I mean? Yeah, dividing by 64 is way too much. No, it has to be by 4. 5. We can divide by 32. I'm late vice vinci here because it's Halloween. Whenever someone says Koi, I imagine Wario saying it. Hey, we got a little bit of it. Nice, nice. We have a little bit of the swaying motion. So we are almost where we want to be. We just need to optimize the numbers a little bit. Awesome. Woohoo! Okay, now it's too much. Oh, that was a delicate balance. I didn't expect that. Are the Koi feedable? No. Woohoo! Okay, let's see what this fish does. He turns around. He turns, he turns too far and then he goes back. Nice, that's exactly what we wanted. There's still the mystery of why do they get stuck sometimes. They feel a little slow to me too. Oh my god. This is a problem. I need to put a limit to this. Will there be fishing games? No. We're just making Kois for the sake of it. The Koi still feel way too slow to me. Maybe we should do like a 50 max speed limit. It's from them turning around a lot, I think. And they just happen to get too much spinning velocity. That guy has too much spin again. Yeah, like he's trying to reach a goal that's somewhere around here. But every time he turns around he just turns too far. Oh, he turned the right amount. That's what happened here, I'm pretty sure. This guy too. What's a good way of solving this? I guess I can crank this that much. bit further down until it just disappears. It's just having fun. He's not having a good time bro, he's losing it. This looks a little better. Nevermind, nevermind, too spun out. This is so stupid. It's because they start turning just fast enough to over-rotate 180 degrees. So... What? They're still doing it. Okay, it has to be something angle-related at this point. Maybe it's this shit again. I shouldn't have a function for this. Yep, exactly, that's what I just put in the fix for Inanimate Maker. They still like to get stuck there, in that one spot. And he got stuck there too. Now there's two stuck here. Get stuck as soon as they touch a thing there. They have a wild hitbox radius, so I feel like that wouldn't be an issue. Hmm. The thing is, there are only areas that aren't just like a circle. Not sure what that means. The entire area is like half a circle, basically. Oh, actually, what might be happening is they generate a goal that's like here, and they can never reach it. Let's put in a protection against that too. They're like sitting inside a circle, I don't know. I don't understand, still. But the fact that I don't understand that is a very good hint that that's not it. Hello? Are we still live? Okay. I wonder if this internet issue is because of the hurricane we're in right now. Or maybe this is just Twitch's fault. Let me think, what does this mean? 6x6? 16x16? 4096 divided by 30? 136 seconds. That's quite a bit. Let's do 6. Right now they're too erratic for my taste. Just kind of feels like random. That's kind of nice. The fish are active, and they're kind of like chasing each other. Let's make sure they still leave behind and stuff. We might have made them too erratic. I think they should chill a little more. They just clustered in the center, yeah. It's probably because... Yep, that guy, ah, ah, he's trying. Yeah. I think we made this number too high. Try this. And maybe this should be bigger too. Like 350 instead. There is a real effect here going on with the emulator not being able to do our random function correctly. So there is a chance that that's also a big reason why it's not working very well. Or very randomly. In which case, if it's the emulator, then like... It is what it is, honestly. Let's see what values the emulator here is generating. This should be evenly distributed between 0 and 360. What we're printing now. Of course, that would be the next step along with animations. Okay, nevermind, the emulator does seem to be generating some randomish values. Good. I think a fish that chases another fish should be faster than that fish. When are you going to stand where the full pond is in view just to see if there are any bugs? You're going to? Hello, Sol, I will not do that. Unless you will be my lawyer and change your name to Better Call Sol. Hmm, okay. We have this, we have that. What are we missing? The swimming depths. Okay. Why did we do this? I feel like this could look interesting. Uh... The hurricane made me low-res? No! I don't want to be low-res. Hmm. I see. What? Oh, that was the emulator lagging. That looks like the... Oh my god, that guy is way below the surface. What is he doing? That won't do it. Hmm. Flying fish, yep. Hmm. I still feel something's wrong with the amount of time they spend not being at their golf. It feels like they spend way too much time just running around, and I don't like that. I want them to chill more. Hmm. Yeah, now they're chilling more. That is kind of nice. Dang, everyone coming in, you're telling me my Luigi's too green. You're like the fifth person. Hmm. I think I'm happy with the fish now. They just need some animations, and then they're very pretty. Hmm. Hmm, I wonder if maybe I should make them swim away from Mario. Let's add a mechanic where they swim away. Okay, we don't want that. Alright, here's our to-do list. To-do, before saving them, make them swim away when Mario gets close. To-do, make sure they cannot clip through floors into land. And I think that's about it. Alright, I think I'm happy with the progress for today, which means I will be seeing you guys in the next stream, which is planned to be tomorrow. Happy Halloween, I have been your host Link. I don't know if you noticed, I'm Link for today. I never really made a big deal of it. So until then, bye bye!
