Hello, hello, hello. Any gamers in chat? Hello, Xlinks. What's up, everyone? Oh, that's kind of working. How's this? Hello, Nicoletta. You're watching an ad, but you assumed I said hi. You would be correct. You're not Kev8n. What part of the stage are you doing today? So I think I finished the boss fight. And now it is time to move on. I can't hear you because... I don't want to sound like a hater, but why are your main channel shorts so cringe? Normally there's a peekable short. I don't make the shorts. There was someone that was like, I want to make shorts for you against pay. And I told him, all right, I'll give you $5 per short. Go crazy. And they made a bunch of shorts that look like mobile game ads. I was like, okay, this is hilarious. We'll do it. I'm not 100% sure yet. Hello, enemy and games fan. I don't know if that would be any good. What do you think? First 15 is not the final boss. Have you played Mario 64? So this is a rough sketch of what we want this to be. This is the inside of the rocket. Only 99% of gamers can collect one coin. I mean, it's probably accurate. It's probably exactly 1%, around 1% of gamers that cannot collect a single coin. That is the inside of the rocket. Which is, after that we have one more sub area to do in course 15. And we're finally done. Oh my God, dude, all the main courses will be finished. That will feel so good. What's the OST for today, boys? Any wishes? If the level was a rule, the fruit of everything you had to learn in the game. No. No, no, no, no. We need to be like, the best there. Spiral, maybe? Okay, Spiral OST could be bang on. Let's try that. Anyone else using the new NVIDIA broadcast and absolutely hating it? It's the genuinely like, terrible software update. Makes big breakaway. I haven't played that one yet. So I'm gonna start a game called GigaLens. I don't know what it's about. But that shit's lore is deeper than FNAF lore. I don't think FNAF lore is very deep. Yes, dude, the main courses are almost, are always done. After that, we can finally move on to polishing content. Polishing content is gonna feel so good after all this time. Yo, Biomech, what up? Can Redundant up to back to backspace levels? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. You all wanna see the fight I made? Offstream? It feels like an eternity since I last streamed. But let me show you the fight I made kinda offstream. So, he's gonna have to pent up his Yoshi body. But the fight is kinda like this. Slams the tentacles down and you destroy the mushrooms. Look at that BFX, dude. Look at that BFX. I love it. I think it looks great. Yo, thank you for the 60 euros, Johan. Oh my god, that's very appreciated. Oh, Sea Witch for today? Pokemon Emerald? Yeah, you will definitely get that. Oh my god, me pausing here is so lucky so I can see the spark here. It's not supposed to do that. Oh, let's fix that. I have to say though, when you donate via YouTube, while I do appreciate it a lot, YouTube does take a large cut of it. So, in that sense, doing it via PayPal is a lot better. But I get the disadvantage that on PayPal I can miss it. And that also really, really sucks. I wish my PayPal alerts worked correctly so I wouldn't notice. Oh yeah, and he spawns these baby Yoshis that you need to destroy. Zayna's currently animating them. So hopefully they will be better once they are animated. Right now they look like brain-dead zombies, which I guess is what they are. He's also spawning way too many, like holy shit. They will float around. They will swim through space like octopuses, basically. Okay, this is entirely too many baby Yoshis. I need to reduce the amount of baby Yoshis he can spawn. This is awful. I know I shouldn't be able to spawn two tentacles on top of each other. He does need, I mean he needs to do multiple tentacle attacks at some point. And ideally they wouldn't overlap each other, but eh. I'd like to see what I can do. Maybe I can figure out a way to rotate them. But then they wouldn't really be targeting Mario anymore. But I think that's fine because the fight right now is too difficult in the global jank anyway. But yeah. You have an idea? Okay. Hello Sam memory. So, I was last working on finishing up the inside of the Warp Pit. And this is not what I wanted. Why is the room in unique chat mode? It didn't let me say hello to you, so there you have it. I don't know. I don't remember putting it in the unique chat mode. That is weird. And concerning. It's four, why did I think it's five, huh? I kept counting five. By the way, it looks like I managed to get some guest authors for a few of the levels, which is very cool. So the guest authors would be Hazer and Martiste. Hazer has been working on a little side level for this game. This is the idea basically. You're like sliding on wind and there's flowers everywhere. It's very pastel colored. I think it's very pretty. It's missing a little bit of sauce, but like I think it's getting there. The boss is the mutated Yoshi here. What do you mean? They will Nintendo for life, they're just not animated yet. Do not worry about it, I know what I am doing. I don't know. It's way too many frames of that. The two of them. Thank you for the donation. Okay, Beta, this is actually funny. The boss was going to talk in ciphers. He was going to speak in an alien language and you'd have to like the ciphers by being smart about it. So I could actually make him say that, but I don't think I want to. So the idea with these here is that they get hot periodically and while they're hot you can't step on them. So you'd have to like stand here and wait for it to not be hot. And then just go. I think that's a good amount of time there. Right? Of course this tech shot doesn't need to be a tech shot. Yeah, you can't really see anything right now. LOL Ultra? I don't think you missed much. What was that? Thank you for the 17 months Sonic the Hedgehog. This and he attacks based on our position in the arena. Let's see. And there's six invisible sections. I think I only attack in this section. In the Yoshi head section he bites you with his tongue like the alien from Alien. Hmm. That is pretty neat. Honestly, maybe I should remove the ground floor in there because then it's very easy to fall in. So I can't see this idea working in that sense. But this might be a little too slow and not dynamic enough. They don't look like they get hot enough. I can just turn up the value a little bit. Let's see, when does it look like this? Maybe? Maybe? That's way too much. Just for you, I'm going to turn this up to 3. Well, in the center of the planet just standing in the middle. Hmm. I can see it working, yeah. I'll note this down for now. And I think I might do it. So, that's the slow question mark. Too easy to fall down because of Yoshi enemies. Pentacles intersecting fields. Pink and easy level 1. I think that's what we'll do. I had hoped to make it a little less traumatizing. So at first I had him grow tumors. And I showed this to someone and they said this is way too disgusting. So I changed the tumors into mushrooms that grow out of the Yoshi. And I think the mushrooms are a little bit better. They look a little less traumatizing, I think. Man, I'm getting sick. Maybe a different movement is better for him.   Okay, that song is a little annoying. Oh yeah, one cool thing I did is it remembers which mushrooms you've popped. And then it spawns no mushroom there sometimes. That's true, Sonic.  Fun fact, I've never played the Hoenn games. If I wanted to play the Hoenn games in the future, should I play the remix or the old one? Coding at RNG is Mario's model tool in NG, I want to make a timer for like 3 questions. Or just make it, I don't know. We need to be more precise. Are the plants in Astral Arcade like the space arm elements in such objects, or are they baked into the logic logic? I think it's different if you make them objects, I could be wrong. One field of plants is one object. We can't make every individual strand an object, because that's way too expensive to render. So, let's do that. I hear a motto behind me, somehow. My wife must be doing something weird. Dude, my parents are coming tomorrow to look at the baby. I'm not prepared to have so many people here. Looking at the baby, yeah, that is a baby. True. The first track there is always really fun custom music, but it seems like we're suddenly limited to the exorcism of the need for magic as well. Is that accurate? It is not accurate. I have no limits, but I do stick to the vanilla Mario 64 songs a lot for the feeling. I wonder if this is just not working. Can you name me some Mario? I was thinking of naming my next child Super Mario so that they can legally use the name Super Mario without getting in trouble. Oh, I know the issue now. This is an inline function. So we need to just copy this. Can I just... Is there an issue with doing this? I think the expression before if... Is this how you do it? It does work. It does fit on a 64 megabyte cartridge. I'm making up my limits. We can check how big the ROM is right now. 58.8 megabytes. We're still pretty good in size. Nice. Why did you get the avatar instead of the summer ground? Do you regret your decision? Thoughts on text effects and text boxes? I'm up for it. As long as it looks fine on an N64. Okay, this looks perfect, dude. That works. That's awesome. CIC. That's great. Cooling can up. Oh, you can just jump out of it. Yeah, this is easy peasy mechanic. Let me show you around the spaceship so you know what's going on here. Let me start at the start of the spaceship, please. Yeah, I always give the player a larger safe zone than it's supposed to be, I think. Alright, so the entrance to the spaceship is a black hole. And then we're here. This is going to be the computer room. There's going to be computer panels here. There's going to be documents on the bookshelf there. Not sure what's here yet. This is stairs. So you first get into this room and you're like, what the fuck am I supposed to do? But then maybe eventually you realize that actually you can just go up here to go to the next room. I know Biobank. I'm still a newbie artist, you know how it is. So we're going up here out of the computer room. Large staircase, big, big staircase here. To the next room, this is the specimen room. There's going to be these tanks here. They're supposed to kind of look like the tanks from the first Pokemon movie with the clown Pokemon. And inside is going to be like tentacles, baby Yoshis, mushrooms, stuff like that. And the green here is going to be the no touching zone. Do not touch the green. So we're going to go through the specimen room here. And then there's this random low gravity zone and you're like, huh, what now? Where am I supposed to go? But look at that. Look at the dust getting sucked up here. I wonder if maybe something's up here. So now you're here in the engine room. And in the engine room, the engine's running hot, so you don't want to touch the engine. And let's just keep going here. There's cogs here, but you cannot see the cogs because the UV mapping is sucky as Biobank said. And then there's more pipes here, but you cannot see the pipes because of the same reasons. Staircases, staircases, staircases. And now we are in the observatory room. So there's going to be this stuff. There's telescopes here. Wait, you cannot see the telescopes. That kind of sucks. There, there's telescopes. They're just invisible right now. And right here is holograms. Oh, that's awesome, Biobank. Guess I have none. I kind of like this hologram. The hologram was actually pretty easy to make. And then when you go out of here, you reach the top. Now you might be wondering, what's at the top? Well, well, well. During the very first star in this level, you walk past the top. And you come out right here, right inside this glass dome. And inside the glass dome, there's going to be a star. And I think that's going to be such a cool moment to come out there and see the star right in front of you. I've come to realize that it's very important to constantly edge the player. So that's what we're doing. We're going to edge the player with the star at the right start, right away. So they have that in mind forever. And it's like a task that they need to finish, but they can't because they can't get there. You know what I mean? You're going to hear a sick, but probably too complex idea from the boss arena. What is it? Movies too? Dude, if you think... If you like getting edged by a TV show, you should watch Netflix's Squid Game, the show. The knockoff Squid Game with real people. It's like anything happens, and the show's like, oh, what's going to happen? Oh, did they do it? Did they not? And by the time they reveal it, you're like, dude, you're so annoying. Just tell me. I no longer care anymore, man. I'm just going to walk away from the TV when you're done edging me. God, I hate Netflix's Squid Game, the show. Anyway, I think that basically means the inside area is done. The last area here. Okay, wait. So basically, the big Yoshi is floating over a planet, and when you approach, anger him, he gets mad and destroys the top half of the planet. Clean off, see a fight on half a planet, and the no-go zone in the center can be the burning core of the planet. That's a cool idea. That is a very cool idea. So he would be clamoring around the planet. Maybe we can already have cracks in the planet and then when you go near, the planet just breaks apart. How would the planet breaking apart look like? Hmm, let me think about this. Let's try. If I can make a good planet breaking effect, I think that would actually be very easy. Okay, do a spin move through it. A spin move? Oh, you mean like he just rips it clean off? Yeah, I see, I see. So, okay, wait, wait, wait. Your idea is basically... Oh, not that. Your idea is basically we make an icosphere. Let's do create sub-conditions. 1000 radius, something like that. And she just like spins this off and it breaks and then it goes away. And then I can make a star and Beyblades through it. Well, he would already be resting on top of the things here, right? Or wait. You mean like he's on top of here and he drills into the planet? Let me think about this. What's the best way to do this? Okay, so he flies into the sky and then he comes down like a Beyblade and destroys it. Like, he would make the fingers point down and go like that. And there would be like debris flying around everywhere. Yeah, like a gacha capsule. That's what I thought at first. Hmm. I definitely like your idea and I think we definitely should do something like that. That would also be lower poly than my whole stupid factory here. And I hate that I have this whole factory here actually. It says please make it more interesting too but like, no, no, no, we don't need the factory. Planet is cooler. So he'd be resting on top of the planet. And then you come by. Maybe the planet has a ring and as soon as you land on the ring of the planet the cutscene starts. He sees you and he like rips it off somehow. But what's the best way to rip it off? Hmm. At first I was thinking maybe he just crushes it. But then like where does it go? Hello Samuel? Loading it would be badass. But how would he explode it? Hmm. The problem is we kind of needed a clean break, right? So him being a beyblade might make more sense. He jumps up and drills into it and then expands his arms and like a bunch of sides of the planet fall off. Drill. Oh, I was thinking drilling from the top and then once he's done drilling it's like... Then it just falls off like that, basically. Okay. Banana, not a banana. Yeah... I guess it doesn't make too much sense. I mean his tentacles would go in the case between here. I think that would look fine. Because if we had one angle that you can look at the planet from it would look different enough. If it was always this angle here... I mean it would also fly away. And then we could put a hole through the entire planet too from like the drill. Like so. It would disappear into a portal and exit inside the planet. So you'd see him jump up this scale into a portal and then afterwards you'd see the planet explode with the Yoshi coming out of it. I think that could also work, yeah. I don't know if I like that better than the drill. The drill is kind of very cool. You get a sneak peek at the portals. That's also true. That kind of looks terrible. I don't know. And then this S.T. Arena would honestly be super easy to work with. I have no complaints about this S.T. Arena. It would make my life so easy. It's not in 6th, but it's in 5th. But I think that's fine. It might even be better. There is no shell. This is a planet. Well, this is going to be a planet. I think I like that. I think I like that. Let me write that down. Right here. Instead of the factory, the Yoshi fight happens on the 8th planet. Also leave his head in the center and continue his plans. Oh. Yeah, that might be better. I kind of, yeah, yeah, maybe. Yeah, let's do that. At first, when you approach the planet, the race starts. No, we can't do proper polo graphics, that's way too expensive, you'd have to make the level rounded and make the level cheaper, did I miss anything, yep I think we can go with this, no complaints, okay next mission, I think add VFX to this and then we can start planning the Mario 64 retro section, I haven't said this yet but each level has a retro section, you already knew that, but the retro section for this level here is Mario 64, I think the retro section for this level here is Mario 64, let me think about that, technically possible but also very expensive, you could like render the game normally, then do a depth right everywhere except on the portal and then render the Yoshi tentacles like normal, so that would get us there, but I think it would be easier to just scale them out of it, then that would be much more reasonable, no the boss model is not even finished, I can show you what the boss model looks like in blender right now, I purposefully did not fully import it yet because I figured Biobank had changes to it, this is what he looks like right now, right now yeah, these two mushrooms are actually mushrooms in game, so ignore that part, yeah, and then you can do an effect where these fade out like so and become normal squid parts, the Yoshi coins are just one extra star, oh wait, we already have this effect here somewhere, now that I think about it, I'm so hilarious when I do it anyway, and that's from course 6, oh yeah, the Yoshi stars won't look exactly like green stars, so you can just spawn them at any angle, the outsides are going to just face the 6 hardcoded positions, oh they already spawned at any angle outside, there's the hardcoded positions, but it not being a circular arena makes it a little jank of course, oh is it an experiment taskbar, do you guys want me to click on Internet Explorer to see what it does, do we do an Internet Explorer reveal, I feel like it's not time yet for the Internet Explorer reveal, I don't feel ready for the Internet Explorer reveal, I'm sorry, we could do an exclusive browser, okay fine I'll click on it, that opens Ares, yeah sure, the boss is a trumpet, whatever, that's exactly what I said, why does it open Ares, we do a little trolling,  dude this whole arena has a t-rex, how cool is that, do you guys remember that, we have a t-rex in this game, god damn, I love a t-rex, RTY doesn't work on Parallel, that's because Parallel is not shit dude, I hate Parallel, I hate Parallel, I hate it so much, the worst part is I helped the guy that makes Parallel fix the bug that broke RTY on Parallel like a day before release, or maybe like two days before release, and then like the day on release they broke Parallel somehow, and also the update that didn't work in Parallel, so no one got the update that made it work, and all of it was like for nothing, ah, you don't like this one, well this is not even part of the demo, it's just in the bonus area that you're not even really supposed to be in, so, obviously in the real game the spelling will be explained in a way that you will not hate it as much, I hope, and the animation, hold on, I think it was Zena and me, another demo feedback thing, at this point I think I have all the demo feedback I could ever need, um, I'm not sure if there's any demo feedback anymore that really does much to change my mind on anything, a lot of the feedback I'm getting now is like either super nitpicky or contradicting another feedback I got, so I can't really do anything about that, so, I do try to take all the feedback into account though, so if there's something that I like I haven't seen yet in the feedback, then I would still consider it, but at this point I think we have like all the feedback that will ever be useful. Yeah, getting out of the water is really the main reason I don't like swimming in Mario 64, but also I don't like it because Mario 64 swimming is made for big water levels, which, you know, fair enough, that's Mario 64, it fits in there, but in RTYI I don't think it fits as well because we do not have big water levels, water is mainly used in small puddles, we do have one big water level, but I do think the controls for small puddles should be significantly different from like the controls in a big water level, like optimally. Yeah, RTYI swimming really is not something to get used to, it's usually just Mario moves where you point them. Fingers on stream, I don't know who made which and I'm not doing that on stream. I'm not giving you an option to change back to vanilla controls, how deranged would that be? What happened here? Oh, oops, I know what happened. There's one thing where I will consistently disagree with the people asking for stuff and that is options. People always ask for more and more and if I added everyone's request for options, I would have an option menu with 260 items and it would be shit like switch to old cap block texture, which is like, reading this option is not worth the time in my life to read this option. You see the disc club and the temple level? I did not, what's wrong with it? Is it like, I bet the origin is just at the wrong point. That's cool, I like stars. I'm working on the next level, which is old shaders in Mario 64. You see this, I actually haven't watched this yet. Oddly enough, there's just one texture in the game that does this render a little different. I'll have to watch the whole thing later. Take a look, it's quite funny. All right, let's see it. Rainbow what? Rainbow right? Can I call it rainbow road or something? I'm not telling users they have a skill issue, I'm telling them like, when you want an option of everything, that makes no sense. Oh, this is missing the light animation.  what happened here? That is funny as f**k. Unironically, some people would ask for that, Sonic. Dude, this is such a banger visual though. I mean, of course it doesn't work right now, but the idea of entering the cave and then there's just a bunch of shy guys doing the secret dance. That's so cool. So, I'm booting up the app so I can see what I can do. What is that Sonic? I've never heard of that. Oh, I see. Yeah, that's not surprising. I actually want this to spawn smoke when it cools down, so this is not the right action. So, self and turn on and it should be on by default. That way you can say you've added every option you have requested, but they just didn't. I'm not adding any of that s**t. Do you know what in work that would be? The guy asked for an option to revert all of Mario's physics. There's like 200 changes. Am I supposed to implement that all with self-modifying code or if statements? Like, wasting so much code time. Hello, voicel. Do you think I'm doing more or less than what I'm supposed to work with, given all the options and all the safety checks? I think it will be easier than the vanilla game, because a lot of things are easier to predict what they will. The code is very simplified, right? That's one big part of optimization. You remove useless codes. You know what they say, like a bad code I can write 100 lines of code in a day, and like a good code I can remove 100 lines of code in a day. Just make him coolie. I don't know what you're asking for. What have you tried? Why are you stuck? I'm not just telling you, like, turn on your computer, open your keyboard, install the hex editor, you know? Like, I don't know where you are. I need some base of where your knowledge is right now. Evelidea, I didn't have time to edit in the one hour since you suggested it. Did you ever import my level? I was planning to do an AESA, but I haven't, but I showed it earlier on stream. We will do that at some point. Dude, I'm just so fucking busy. I generally just do not have time to do anything. Yeah, okay, I'll show it again. Here's Azawaza's level. This is what he's planned for this game. Very pastel color, very Yoshi's Island, and that's why I like it. Yeah, you know, it's a basic shit, but Azawaza was quite simple. Whether something is simple or not just depends on your skill level. I do think it's quite simple as well. And basically, you just fucking add a cutscene, like, huh. Okay, does this next one not do anything? Let's check. I haven't. Do you think it's worth playing? I've seen it on stream and I've seen Bovat show it to me. It looked like an interesting idea, but I'm not sure if he was on the right path, making it a fun experience. Huh? I got a 90. Okay, so it's doing this, but not doing anything else here. Is it spawning the smoke, but I just can't see it? It is spawning, but invisible. Let me check if it's also invisible in course 6, because maybe the effect just doesn't work. Oh, animation is rough. Oh my god, what happened here? Yeah, the portal animation broke at some point, I haven't fixed it yet. What the fuck? This is what happens when you keep changing the engine, all the levels just break. The mysterious blue orb is my VFX editor. Yeah, it's not spawning any smoke here either. Yo, I got fucking eaten? He eats you like that? I forgot he does that. That's fucking mental as fuck. I forgot about that. Let's see why the burn smoke doesn't work. No opacity maybe? Hmm. Is the flicking triangle just inanimate, I think? It's an old level that I haven't worked on for a long time, and since then I changed my microcode and all that kind of stuff. So, very likely it's just generating invalid display lists. Yeah, still no smoke. Let's try to spawn 0x35, see if that shows up. Also, also, very important. This. Do you think I have the warp problem? I had it on the end, I just splined with the first warp. Hmm. I haven't really thought about the warps at all yet, but like. Probably what we'll do is just make it so that Mori moves in the direction the warp is facing, yeah? Huh. Huh. Doesn't spawn anything right now. What if we use this? Yeah, it's natural that old levels break over time if you change so much in the engine. I'm not worried about it, it's gonna be easy to fix. Okay, so it spawns this. There's something wrong with the black smoke that makes it not spawn, I guess. Okay. I don't see anything immediately wrong here. Okay. That actually, yeah, that is one of the first things we've ever made. Oh, I haven't shown you this, but you're gonna like this. I upgraded our rain. This is also one of the best areas in the game. Look at the new rain. It's like a full texture now. Looks a lot better. The green there is just an effect bleeding wrong. I'm in class 64. And it's very rainy, it is very rainy. Dude, this is so funny still. I love this plank here. Small splashes on the floor is way too expensive. You'd have to do all the collision checking for everything. I mean, I can give it a try at some point, but I'm just 99% sure it's too expensive. Anyway, let's figure out what's going on here. Okay. Kill Kali if you can manage to do it by yourself. Okay. I don't know how this might go. Is the model also an issue? Okay. After quest 15 we'll do a lot more beta testing. So we'll likely spend a lot of time fixing old levels. And then probably... The overworld. And the overworld and the side levels have to be worked on in tandem. Okay. I remember that. You said, oh my god, this house looks so boring. I'm gonna make a banner and then we just went and made a banner. Oh, I see the issue. So in RTYI, layer 5 is no longer layer transparent. Layer 5 is layer transparent decal. Because transparent decals have the issue of rendering behind normal transparent surfaces.  Still no good. Let's look deeper. Should be fine. Okay. See, no issue with that. Wait, is this the burn smoke? Oh, it hasn't been showing up at all. Are you used to the final boss yet? I think the final boss also should be story inspired. And we're still kind of working on the story. I was thinking, since Bowser is making the Yoshis work for him, the final boss should be what the Yoshis have been building for Bowser, right? So maybe like a big Bowser mech? But we already have a big Bowser mech, so eh. Cody, I already told you that if you can steal it yourself, you're free to steal it. If you cannot steal it, then no. Then get fucked. It's as simple as that. What if the burn smoke... Actually, no, the burn smoke exists, right? Does that exist? Which is the one that Mario spawns? Yeah, if you can get it from there, then you're free to use it. This is the rule for all my stuff. If you are able to use my stuff without my help, then you're free to use it. Hmm. Hmm. The oil drill is using it without any issue. I should be using something like this anyway. Should I not? Hmm. Hmm. See, the reason I don't give out my stuff like that usually is because then people ask me on how to use it, and I don't want to deal with that. Hmm. I know the issue actually. I don't need this. I just realized what the issue is. It said it doesn't work. Because I changed the struct here. Hmm. Bowser with Yoshi abilities? That's a funny idea. Bowser would just like, turn into a Yoshi. Bowser stole all the Yoshis because he desperately wanted to turn himself into one, and now Bowser is just a big Yoshi. Funny, but no, I don't think so. There we go. That was the issue. It needs to spawn a lot more than that. Hmm. And it needs to only do that if it's in view, because there's going to be a lot of this. So, uh oh. Hmm. No, but I haven't really thought about the final boss yet. It's still like, up for whatever we feel like. Hmm. I thought it would be way too much smoke for the game to handle it, but I guess not. I guess this is fine.  Actually that makes sense, because a lot of the smoke is not spawning. Why is it always spawning behind? Oh, I know why. Hmm. Loops me a bullet though. I don't know, but there has to be something the Yoshis have been working on. There we go, that's much better. Next step, make it only render if it's actually in view. Or spawn when it's in view. Hmm. I'm seeing bubble the big no-chain and build a huge- How is that a boss fight though? Getting an insert of hot pipe at the end where you have to jump to dodge the bomb would be too hard. Hmm. No, I don't think that'd be too hard. But also at this point, I don't know where to put that. You know what, if you want you can make this pipe longer or something, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, I know, this step- Okay, even if you get hit, you don't die, right? So it's fine. I don't think part 6 for this is a cutscene here. 15 core, 60 core. The usual. Oh, you don't need the cutscene spawns, I don't think I used them. Hmm. You know what, let's skip it. No, it's too much. Hmm. Hmm. There we go Bro, it doesn't matter what you use for cutscenes You can define them however you want. When I made last time back the cutscenes were defined as like their own hex script compiler No splines whatsoever Just do what you want bro. It's programming. There's a million ways to achieve the same goal They should probably not be defined here if I'm gonna use them again All right, so this hopefully still spawns the smoke but it's not gonna spawn any when it's out of view The way we can verify this is by turning the camera real fast once the smoke starts and seeing that there's no smoke That's already advanced and out of view That's true Biomech, it's a banger idea Okay, wait Yeah, you see that right now when we do this The smoke advances but then as soon as I turn the camera all the smoke is like infantile Like it's just no spawns This lets us add so much more smoke we can add so much fucking smoke now This might be a little overkill, I'll be honest Let's do this before the raycast Oh Wait what? It spawned at once and then not again What the hell Huh Nice to large that sounds like maybe Maybe Huh That would be like an EEPROM thing shouldn't do that unless you change something in T What went wrong here, this is bizarre to me couldn't do this I Could break the game or something Yeah, you guys have no idea of the horrors of the tuna shake I Like does it once and then breaks forever How did it not happen when it was like this What's the difference we don't set O plus Y? Why would O plus Y not work? Hello Ponypods And Two is too much I'll leave the functionality here, but we'll leave it unused. I But Other hackers would definitely recommend you use like a bar 64, so it's really up to you if you wanna Listen to me or to literally everyone else For most people it's probably better to do what like literally everyone else does For you to decide You Can probably do to walk X here, right? You don't even need that There's hella shortcuts you can do here You The second Mario 64 That's a repository you made by a bunch of Mario 64 I guess that's supposed to make hacking easier and make your heck like more performance and a better time running on n64. I Think it breaks a lot of things stone and that's why I don't like it. I didn't need to do that You Think uses both because if that sounds like you're using Hacker Mario 64 with a few defines off not like a music fellow No, it is based on the decompilation it's one repository based on the decompilation There's some special features Did I ever show you guys the water plantation Dude, it feels like I did so much stuff since the last time I streamed. How how was I so productive? How's this even remotely possible? I Mean it's instead of eight Vanilla Mario 64 should not be able to give us if you just turn on good compiler place and better compression. I Think with my flex vanilla Mario 64 would probably like maybe like 5.5. I don't know though Maybe I can is better compression. I don't know if they implemented lc4 yet. I really need that So I implemented this whole sub area here look what you can do here, isn't that fucking sick I Like this a lot. It looks a little buggy At the ends of the radiators, what is the radiator You Mean the ovens there in the area when literally no texture was here we met. Yeah, we're gonna change a few units in that area Oh What about all the plants what do you mean what about all the plants They likely won't even have to say like show It's this what you're talking about by Mike this area here the plant area I'm thinking maybe I'll make it so you can attack with the corn Yeah, there's the plantations a separate area This is when they bring the water that they found from the water reservoir I still have a rare bug in my game. We're doing a BLJ crashes. Obviously do not want that A lot of people say you can't be on J in this game, which is just not true. You can definitely enjoy in this Come on one good one, please for the people one good one for the people Come on I Have to do this now, I'm sorry guys, I'm getting stunned but but I can't not do anything right now I don't know why it feels so inconsistent in this game. I Didn't like try to prevent the play from building. Yeah, there's the crash And now the whole game's gone too bad My shot, I'm really really bad at mashing my match speed is like seven or eight a second I think that was a good one, but then that happens Yeah, probably Sonic I gotta fix that Because I'm what if I knew where that wouldn't happen I gotta look into it anyway I'm not bad at BLJs. I'm just bad at mashing. Usually you don't need to mash very fast for BLJs, but why does it crash? Why are you asking me how do you expect me to just know these things? It's a bug and that means it's an issue that I don't know the reason for I would have to look into it and find out what the bug is You guys want to get into a fight maybe 16 a presses in 16 minutes. That's not a lot I Don't know how that can even happen Somewhere there's just a code that's like probably an infinite loop or a null point or read or whatever Maybe Mario's action state changes twice in a frame and then it changes back and forth between the same two states forever And Anyway Retrosection so I want the retro section to go through all main areas of Mario 64 But I realized that this might be too big for a retro section We're gonna take like just a very small piece of each course Well, this is very simple to compute if you go from right to left but I'm not doing it for you right now You Sure, please explain You So if we have just a part just the intro bow on battlefield to the octagon you land on Going forward and then there is the bridge part then maybe it like goes around to a little bit of a Worms Fortress tower and then Maybe somewhere in the tower. There's like a cave to go into Jolly Roger Bay. I think this is too much job You Like we're doing too much here we got a we got a I think we have to cut some of this Like duplicate areas like snowman slant is basically a duplicate of Cocoa Mountain. I think we can remove that I think tiny huge island in World Rare World can also be removed But Would it feel right to remove some of those not really I See what you mean my leg We could do only like the highlights like on battlefield bridge. Sure. This sure Jolly Roger Bay. Maybe not Cocoa Mountain Yes, big loose one. Yes, lazy maze cave. Yes Lisa Lama, it's kind of a stink. I think I Went very well town for sure take that Falcon Ranger right like we could just pick a bunch of these like so Copy of what decor One two, three, four, five six seven eight parts like this, maybe that's better I Don't know what happened you would be at the beginning of all battlefields where there would be where you would be finding a tower like bombs fortress styles And get it it's still like some kind of copy of the original Super Mario 64 here You're like on stream there's no copy of our 64 stream. Oh This is a retro area in the style of bar 64 It means it's gonna be like a pure platforming level that has the visual art style of Super Mario 64 You So on top of the bombs fortress tower Maybe it would stand next to big ice mountain that you climb and then on the ice mountain you find a horror mansion And you go into the horror mansion and find an underground cave in there And inside the cave you find the wet dry well town And then the town has a clock tower and on top of the clock towers rainbow, right Three parts of levels floating in space Wait I have an idea on how this could work Yeah, this is what I was thinking like a snippet of level just floating like this and Then like from there you jump to the next snippet of flower Is that what you're thinking by the way do one more low from that 64 that's not from that 64 that's from me I Can see that work So when we actually just take literally just a piece of the level What about hazy mace cave though and big Busan's and I and I a dog that daily diners can work big puss horns I guess it can work. Yeah Tick-tock clock sure. I Think you might be onto something so we just give it a floor You can do a floating merry-go-round. Oh, yeah Bro someone's evolving The hanging braids, oh So like go to the next piece of level. I Can see that working as well That would also feel very exciting Do I still have tomorrow 64 levels somewhere let me check my photos here I might have it in my DMS with you You God when did I make open world bar 64? Does anyone know when I made that? Must have been like what 2018 There's 36 of pages of the EMS with files between me and them so this is going to take a little bit Oh, that's a really cool idea You SM64Levels.rar That could be it That's true, that's like the ultimate Yoshi redemption It's a .skp file You're fucking kidding me It's an skp file No! Why is it a .skp file I hate 2018 There's another one Oh it's also all .skp files No! Do I have to install Google Sketchup for this No man, this can't be What do you call them, a wise man, a grown up? I can send you free Sketchup Wait, I found an .skp to .obj converter here While you're waiting for the files to be converted here are some games to play, no download or installation Okay, let's play Tetris while this is going on with 20% It's a quick round of Tetris Let's go Bro, who is this made for? Why is this a thing? Why is it asking me to play Tetris while I wait, that's so funny I'm not very good at Tetris by the way What the fuck, that's not what I meant to do Sorry guys, the website asked me to play Tetris I'm not very good at Tetris I'm not very good at Tetris Bro, this Tetris is so slow, what a slow piece of shit Is this how Tetris always is? That's no way Tetris is that slow While the .obj was not the expected format, please check your files, .gen and .skp file You're kidding me, I did Tetris for nothing? In .skp? Yep, yep, true, true, that's so fitting Good pun But can't you import from NeutronMars64? No? Let's see if we find another free online .skp .obj converter Damn it Do you even need to crack Sketchup? I thought you can just get Sketchup for free I literally just do not want to install Sketchup Tell me the files, you will convert, I will send you the files What's your Discord name? Do I have you? HooliKaleb? Is that... Is this you? Let me check Your name is censored, so I can't... Because I'm in streamer mode ChaoticPolygon? Nope, that's not HooliKaleb HooliKaleb plays, let's see Shit, where are you? I can't find you, which Discord are you in? You don't exist Why do I even send you a message? Oh, that's you, that guy I'll succeed the upload limit? Alright, I'm just gonna... You know what, why don't I just send you the raw file? There you go, now you have level rips of every level on R64, isn't that cool? I only need the 15 main courses and the castle grounds Oh yeah, Badou's matchup on the reddit section? Dude, I'm looking forward to that Sure you can, Koolie Do not change the levels, please Okay, so let's think about which part of each level we're gonna do Battlefield is going to be... Definitely the bridge part, right? Octagon bridge Oh wait, maybe like a Worms Fortress falling plank connecting to... Worms Fortress tower Hello RMSQ, glad you're enjoying it See Worms Fortress Maybe like the start of Worms Fortress with the fence up until the tower But like the backside is missing or something In platformer we have free floating bombs Bombs are very cool, free floating? I see that Galab, big boss horns I mean, looks fine though, right? That's just what Mario 64 levels look like Yeah, there could be like a section of wall next to Worms Fortress And then you land on the grass part afterwards, with like bombs coming out of it or something So you know the section of Worms Fortress where the bombs are? That's what we'll do, I think Hmm, does that work? Let me think about it Maybe that's not so good Hmm, let's see Jolly Roger Bay, what do we do with Jolly Roger Bay? Yeah, so we're making a retro section that is Mario 64 themed soybean Unblocks from the boat, maybe dodging the falling pillars Let's see Unblocks from the boat, this is good The water, what do we do when you fall into the water? Do we make the water small? Make it just like a little pond? Jolly Roger Pond? The walls would be like the mountain walls but way smaller, I guess It's gonna be weird to look at it from the side though Hmm I guess we can make it like double sided and have the beach on each side And then the beach at the end is bigger Beach Unblocks Boat Beach Hmm, or like Locking Shore High up I think that works That's gonna be good Umm How do we go to Cocoa Mountain? Hmm What do we use of Cocoa Mountain? Maybe in Cocoa Mountain you start at the bottom of the mountain where the little wood cabin is and you have to climb up Umm Start at the wooden cabin And be on the bridge with the snowman Hmm Yeah, I like that I like the contrast here Dude, this is almost like shitting on Vanilla Mario 64 in a way That is also funny Hmm Maybe you literally just jump over Big Boos Haunt How do we do the transition to Big Boos Haunt? I like the idea of there just being a haunted house on top of the Cocoa Mountain Hmm It's too strong, Meta Pikmin It ruins the game a little bit It's too oppressive for the game's design Tower Assembler What's that mean? Oh, the Tower of the Castle Yeah, that's well known Hmm Yeah, we need a tower separately because of that So much meta and fun There's a boss to strike here Maybe there can be an easy mode or something We had the idea to do an unlockable thing like that anyway But I wouldn't count on it if I were you Which part of Big Boos Haunt do we even want? Hmm Well, the most useful ability would be to press L to levitate or debug movement mode But that doesn't mean that's a good thing to enter the game Yeah, it will be decor I will open-source all my stuff Mega Run is iconic True Hmm What if, in the top, there's the wooden cabin from the top of CCM But it leads into the basement Hmm Hmm We will merely go around the dimension, I guess Hmm What do you call it? Hallways And then just a cave entrance and we're in Hmm Here's a mace gift Definitely we need the toxic mace Toxic mace Rush And then maybe that just turns into a volcano down there Hmm That should be a good idea Thinking about it  Could be a cave and then a void and then like a mesh thing that you climb along And then as you climb along it you get to the volcano area Somehow And then you're inside the volcano and need to climb up Hmm Hmm I'll stretch out the lava that you climb over with the mesh fence Then I'll climb I think this is good enough by itself Hello, I'm your cat This feels like it's going to be a lot of work But at the same time this is all just vanilla Mario 64 so maybe not Hmm I'm a little worried about memory though Because if I look at my game's RAM here Not a novelty move, it's still very useful and I use it a lot But there's nothing here in memory which is very good There's nothing in 8067 either Okay, so We do have just over half a megabyte of memory left That's honestly like really good I think we'll be able to import this without an issue then Oh, that would be really sick I can suggest it to Badoop, but maybe he has a good idea with it Oh, optional earth What if we, like, at the start of the game We have, like, an options menu and it's at, like, heart Which would be, like, a picture of an evil Bowser And then, like, normal mode, which is the controls we have right now And then baby mode And it's, like, a baby picture and it's, like It's, like, an adult man with, like, a pacifier And then that's, like, the one where you get the pictures from your grandpa Baby Mario, Mario, Bowser No, I'm not adding difficulty modes, I'm just chit-posting properly Yeah, we're not adding difficulty modes It's nice seeing no stress I like that, too Anyway, we were here Then you climb out of the volcano What happens? Let me think about it I kinda think the Toxbox stretch would be, like, really cool to use Hmm Oh, but I don't wanna input the Toxboxes at the same time Hmm, maybe we can make Mario, like, climb the outside of the pyramid Maybe that's, like, good enough Eh, this is difficult What do we take from Shifting Sand Land? Hello, excellent gamer Link him from pillar to pillar Oh, that's an interesting idea Yeah that's kind of cool yes it will be open source anyway you want examples of how the grandpa dive is useful all right let me show you let's just go to course one as an example say i want to speedrun this game first of all it's the fastest way to get momentum so i'm going to do a grandpa dive right here then i would like go ah no go over here go over here there that was a grandpa dive that was another grandpa dive this is like optimal movement there and then fly over there or where else let's say i'm right here and i want to climb up here you see that doing the grandpa dive there let me skip ledge drop and redirect my speed hmm where else would i use it probably everywhere or i can use it right here to skip that part oh like so it just limited my own creativity so well of course it would be stronger then but it's so overpowering that you can't really do anything else movement-wise that's the problem with it  my coins look so good because i have a sick shader on them that's very complicated to use but if you look very close you can see their sprites oops so you know what if not after you're done here um we have another bizarre floating fishbowl thing fly over to dbp um i guess this is just a shipyard part shipyard or shipyard on the submarine dude i'm gonna make the submarine not like here it will be such a flex my school's 15 done policy sequence 60 no it's 15 courses and no the overworld is missing inside levels and stuff i don't cryptics musics supix music sorry not cryptics what if we recreate the leg of the submarine actually you deserve your work i don't understand what does that mean that would be funny suffix i think he'll probably play this one so yeah although this one changes a lot of physics in vanilla r64 so you might not want to play it for fear of losing his vanilla r64 skill oh yes the totally real o2 thing if only hacks were compiled with o2 so they would run better how do you shoot over from here um um oh we could have a ticking time box section here i don't think so but i'm like i'll give it like a seven percent chance so ichi has the last impact world record what you're like mitten uh it's decent mitten is um they should have given the game like two more weeks in the oven they needed to have like at least one beta tester play through it and watch like fix all the issues that person ran into because the game was cool but like really rough very unpolished i think i mean they should have just given up those two weeks  how do you get to the town from there i don't think we can just put it inside the cannon on top of the snowman is there not no there's not but you get there with a cannon no you do not but you can we'll put a cannon inside the snowman's head let's see how does he play last impact eight minutes 38 how does this even work wow they all want to see the life react to this right now yes no hell yeah let's go all right life react we're gonna turn this into a youtube video so fun fact i don't watch last impact speedruns i actually wanted to save this so i could react to it one day and we're doing it right now uh green suichi zero star world record i know green suichi is like insane runner so i'm looking forward to this nine minutes 30 seems like a pretty good time to me two rng split and a very unhappy gate boj that's not good foreboding so when i made this game i actually knew that there was at least one way to do zero star here and it was with the coconut i wonder if that's what they do nope okay okay i see i see that makes sense fair enough and i know there's a way to get yeah i knew this penalty i made this game knowing about it yep fair enough 45 seconds seems pretty fast here i also knew of a way to get over here uh i think there's a different way to get in there that's way slower but i'm glad runners found this where are we going oh what what what what is this what what is huh oh he's not even beating shadow mario that's cool okay big gold and yep i knew of that one too i just left it in the game because i wanted people to do zero star runs of this somehow i do kind of wish they beat the bosses though that would be more fun to watch oh well oh my god how is there eight minutes of run left does the last boss take that long oh and there's no way to skip this right because that's literally just a code warp that you cannot activate unless you actually pressed all the switches so you're forced to do this ground pound through it yeah without a ground pound interesting pretty sure there's a lava boost here yeah all those ground puns dude is he nervous oh last i booked this up for credits right there's there's a dialogue here holy fuck dude god god there's so much small geometry to get stuck on here so it's pretty clean so far the boss themes yes chat is right the boss themes are kind of a banger les g and dot star money made it this g made the first one dot star money made the second one actually kind of insane that this game has two final boss songs oh that's cool he won't grab the star right yeah the star saves your state here of having the elevator available so if you collect a star you can die but like obviously you wouldn't plan on dying in the speedrun yes dude oh he's going for this dang that's a cat said you can't avoid the damage the poopy music speed up effect and like these stupid hands and this stupid face god damn dude that really could have been done better making this landscape and skinshot must have been such a pain so yo it's the goomba bros that we've totally seen throughout the game please bro please give me good energy i really should have made it so that the goomba bros are more relevant if they show up in the end i just put them here because i noticed that beta testers like them a lot and i was like oh well we should use them more i couldn't program a transformation sequence properly in the asm so i had to do it like that i remember this oh that was insane to get hit that fast that's crazy  it's not like a setup that's consistent that was good oh my god that was an insane fight holy that was good that was perfect actually perfect oh my god jesus christ ggs all right i'm not gonna watch the credits that was a cool run very nice it's crazy how nobody knew who he was when he did this me you're done caleb that's cool thank you very much oh here here now that game released in 2016 oh i see i mean to be fair that's how a lot of speedrunners start um think about it if you are the type of person who wants to be first at something you would start speedrunning a romhack right so naturally it makes sense that the people that become first on r64 speedrunning did start with romhacks the same happened with pankation he also used to run star road oh very very nice this is awesome and it all works let me get another one very nice they're all here there's a plus elbows are in the first round of being able to move and so i don't know either in general it seems like a romhack that hasn't gotten that much attention which not surprising because i was under a lot of constraints when i made this and i don't think there's anything that really stands out for it to be able to have a cultural impact like it's it's made for the one person that commissioned it of course there's nothing like super coherent about its design goal that like would appeal to a larger audience literally just the tower right just literally just the what do you do in ttm maybe climb over some some mushrooms so no they removed all the downloads from it sonic because that was a day i gave some bullshit reason for it the slides i guess the slide would also work but i think i prefer the mushrooms i think with the slide we can't really increase the difficulty you know what i mean with very little control over it so and then th i maybe the center the the windy mountains with the bowling balls so yeah that's true slides are iconic all right fuck it ttm slides  what if the last section was just the carpet right but like like the carpet right would be easy as fuck too but like you're on a carpet you're anxious you're feeling it the pressure is on i think that's cool so which i can do i can run with the wig glove rubbing around in circles above you um without a dark void below it doesn't really feel right but maybe we can have just the dark void below yeah yeah that's a little more unique let's do it i think i don't want the wiggler floating above you though i think this is a good setup for the final section and i'm going to start working on it i might stream again tomorrow some of the work on it but for now i i'm done i have places to be tonight and i'm gonna finish my workout so i'm going to cancel the stream for now and i will see you guys maybe tomorrow maybe tuesday maybe saturday
