Hello, hello? Anyone here? Hello ExternalMight, hello Loimington, hello Pepe. Today we are probably gonna start on course 11. So, we do need a bit of a design document here. Oh boy, this document is getting large. Hello Nalmon Provision. So the Bowser fight is basically finished. Yo Oshk, long time no see. And the Bowser fight just needs some animations in SFX and VFX, but we are waiting for Zeno's animation first before I implement all that. Hello Epic Legend, to you as well. So we have been planning over World 3 a little bit already. We were planning 15 courses at the beginning of the development and a lot of the courses kinda suck. So we are going with new ideas. And today the plan was gonna be Bowser's Frantic Fleet Factory, but we should probably also look at the other course ideas and see how this works out. So course 15 being a computer-based level, kinda cool, but also kinda lame cause we already did that in Lost Impact. Course 14 was gonna be a comic-based world, where Mario is the hero and you are like in a city, which also I think is very cool. Ice-cream-based level with an arctic train, it's kinda lame, it's swamp kinda shit. And then we have two secret levels, Swamp Mushroom first, I like that. And yeah, I think those two both work better as like side levels. So... We do need some new ideas for courses. You're still planning on doing the Paypal level? No. There's the Paypal Mario 8-bit level now. And once I did an idea for a course but forgot about it sadly, understandable. Let me show you what we actually made for the Bowser fight now, that it is finished. It just needs animations, sound effects and visual effects. And then it's all done. I'll add the intro next, I forgot about that one. So it starts off with a bunch of enemies just parachuting over to you. Two of them just killed each other. And then once you beat all the enemies, one of the Yoshi ships can land on here. Waiting for it right now, unless I forgot an enemy. There we go. And then with the Yoshi ship, you attack Bowser. Yeah. That was not my intention. Let's do that again. You could do the computer level in like Matrix if you want to. Yeah, it would be kind of something like that. The theme would be like you reached the last part of the ROM and this is like a crazy part. Things are going weird here. The level is turning back into bytes. Shit like that. You know, like how a kid imagines the inside of a computer to be like. I'm planning some speedruns, like sequence skips that are hard to pull off, but actually intended. Yeah, there's tons of stuff like that. And then you throw Bowser off and he gets picked up like a little baby. But a lucky two, like a Mario Kart. It's like, yep, next round. A music level. Hmm. I mean, there are good ideas for a music level, but it's already kind of been done in Star Road. So it's a bit of a lame concept. Giant ice cream. Well, that was one of the ideas, but that idea got delegated to just a side course. Can't be mad music a mess. No. Any ideas for the final Bowser level? The final Bowser level is going to be in space. That's the only idea I have for it.  So far, it's going to be the one space level in this game. Oh shit, I died. Well, you saw the fight, though. This is how it will work out. I'm going to make it so that if you fade out at the bottom, you just lose one HP and land back. A level where inside Bowser? No! Okay. I don't know. Raphael the Raven. Hello, Dimension. Please do not type Spanish at me. So other ideas. Actually, we're talking about this. Casino, obviously casino. And Bowser's Frenetic Fleet Factory. I already wrote all this down. I think it's very cute and I like it. I'm making a build for PAL and region systems. Nope, I'm only talking NTSC. Reviews are great. Is that actually visual 30 FPS? Is the frame pacing okay? I was just gonna fade him out. You don't need to see that. No. I might be running low on course ideas. Which is an issue. But we should be going back up to having 5 backup ideas. Right now we only have 4. What's my favorite level theme in Odyssey? I mean, Odyssey does some crazy shit like the head world. Which is really cool. Hello, Clayman. Another water level? I don't like water levels. I don't think that's a controversial opinion. Is this the exact same code? Oh, wait. This is the same. Okay, got it. Hello, Lilaa. You are not pinked. That is very unfortunate. Wait, why would I have the code like this? This should work. If it doesn't, unlucky. Hello, Sacrein. Yeah, I'm streaming on YouTube now. It's gonna happen. The logic updates steadily, but the frame pacing is a bit choppy. From what I could test on EMU. And some of this on hardware. And they say that when new crones are grubbing image. Well, but if the frame pacing is choppy, then it's trash. Right? If you alternate between 40 milliseconds.    And 20 milliseconds frames, then it's just unplayable. I don't know those games. Yeah, I mean. That's like all Mario games, right? Except for Sunshine. The way they are framed. They allow for some wild level themes. Let's check the levels in Mario Odyssey. See if we can find something.  What would you do in a mall? I kind of like a mall idea. But. A mall doesn't feel like it could be. A late game level. You know what I mean? A mall is like all course one. Happy baby time. We're not doing a spooky abandoned mall. We already have a ghost ship. A mall where reality is catching summer. That's one of those crazy concepts you'd see in anime. Which I kind of like. You know what? We don't have any lava levels. Or like volcano level or anything like that. This image just reminded me. We could absolutely do something like that. Labo. Laboratory. Hmm. Not sure what would be in there. Minecraft's new nether. What's that? This looks pretty generic to me. The level with the big dinosaur. True, there's a lot of lava in that. And a volcano. But it's not like a dedicated lava world. Okay, a Koopa Kanoa also has a lot of fire. You know what? That is fair. Oh, we should look at Mario Kart 64. Levels. Let's see if Mario Kart 64 has any cool locations we could use. The cardboard level instead? Nah. Eh. I'm not really sure what would be in a cardboard level. It feels so Paper Mario, you know? Free Raceway. Wario Stadium. Moomoo Farm. Yoshi Valley. Yoshi Valley is so cool. Can you turn this into a Mario 64 level somehow? The superhero level idea is planned as a Quest XIV. Right now we're just brainstorming.  See, the way I see designing a game to be, you should come up with 15 ideas and use 5 of them. Right now we have 4 ideas and we need to use 5. So we're really behind. We need more ideas so we can pick the higher quality ones. We shouldn't just have 5 ideas and be like, yep, that's it. Those are the best ones. We're not remaking fucking Green Hills. You didn't announce the stream on Discord? Oh, shit. Let me just figure out how to do that. Alright, I'll ping everyone.  Notification squad. Twitch. Live now. There you go. Shrink to the atomic level so the level is very chaotic and liminal. It has to... Okay, the thing about games is, it's good to have a complex game as long as it's easy to understand. And if you shrink to subatomic physics, it's not going to be easy to understand anymore. Hailfire peaks with a sky and underground. That's just a normal level. Isn't it? Oh, shit. What if we had like a Yoshi Wild West? Like Yoshi Valley Wild West. Like the Wild West Valley. I like that. That's such a stupid idea. Wild West Valley. Okay, but who are the cowboys in here? You know what? Wait. I don't know.    Okay. Nice mic bump. Thank you. Poochie with a cowboy hat would be so cute. True. Hello, James. You could do something with the Mario Kart 64. Four Towers. I forgot what it's called. Four Towers? Bowser's Castle? Oh, do you mean Donut Land? Like in the versus mode? The Skyscraper level? Wait, there's a Mario Party 2 map called Wild West World. Westerland. Yeah, like this could be a theme. Block Fort, right. What's in this? A choo-choo train. Bunch of cowboys. Bows are being wanted. Krakat floats? They are just base one float. Base two floats. That's how I call them. Don't call them Krakat floats. What is this? You can have cactus people as cowboys. I don't know those. The obvious choice is to make the cowboys Yoshi's. But I don't want to have a color splash situation where everything is just one species. Okay, creep attack. You have to shut the fuck up. Shrinkwraith and microscopic stuff. I don't want to make a big, big world, you know. Make the cowboys sniff it. Shy guys actually work really well, don't they? What is generally in this? Aren't there usually cowboys in here? How do I not remember this map at all? The server Yoshi's have video games. What if he went into your console's eShop and was personified as a virtual mall? I think that's like too far out there. How about the bean people in the bean kingdom? No, I don't like those games. Shy guy cowboys and Yoshi cowboys. You know what? That actually works very well. Because in Yoshi's Island, shy guys are like the main enemies. So if there were shy guy cowboys and Yoshi cowboys, that would work really well. I think they're actually called snuffits. Aren't they? Is there one as a cowboy? There is! This is perfect! Do you know what a spaghetti western is? Nope, I do not. How is this server called? The Western World and Origami King. No, I do not want to shop. I want videos, please. Hmm. Stormy's gonna have 15 courses? Yes! And this is course 11. A retro pipe themed around a virtual game like Mario Clash or an adventure would be really cool. You mean like Virtual Boy or what is virtual? What is a spaghetti western? What the fuck? Is there no western world in Origami King? I want the video, please. We tried a few Virtual Boy games, Paul, but none of them really worked. We are planning the next level for the game I'm optimizing. It's just a theater scene? Okay, that's fair. Because he was Italian. Oh, okay. Very appropriate, I see. If Poki is standing... Oh yeah, Poki should definitely also be there. I think the Wild West Valley could work as a course 12. We only need to write down ideas right now. We don't actually need to plan out the level. Basically, just to reiterate, we have 5 more level slots left. And we have in total 7 level ideas. Well, we also have 2 side levels, right? So in total 7 slots. And we have 7 level ideas. But having 7 slots and 7 ideas, while it sounds very convenient, it means that you cannot be picky about your ideas. So you need to come up with more ideas so you can discard the bad ones, right? You try to plan them out, see what works, and then just remove a few. Hello, Marinova. Did you meet Rosemary? Yes, I met Mint as well. Yoshi Valley could make... Yeah, exactly. Just the Western Yoshi Valley world would just work perfectly. What are the ideas so far? We have the idea. A casino level. Kind of sucks because it was already Lost Impact. But I really like casino levels and I want to make a good one. Computer level. Same thing, it was already Lost Impact, so that kind of sucks. We have a superhero comic book world, where Mario would be like the superhero going through a dark, grim city and solving crime. We have a Wild West Valley. Which is, there's Yoshi Cowboys, there's Snuffits that shoot through their mouth. There's Pockys around, there's the Yoshi Valley thing from Mario Kart. And we have the Frantic Fleet Factory, which this level is pretty much set in stone. Frantic Fleet Factory is going to be Bowser's Airship Factory. There's going to be a bunch of NPCs running around that are building Bowser's ships, and you mess with them. Waluigi's Vending Machine. I feel like that's not the best idea. Add Dry Bones. I am not adding Dry Bones. Don't forget Bend. Oh yeah. Yoshi's Island Bandits. Dude, there's so many outlaw potentials here. Maybe this level should be about catching outlaws. Level is about catching outlaws that are in the world. You have to solve puzzles and be a detective. You get to be a detective in this level. That is so cool. I like that. I have nothing against Dry Bones. There's just this one guy that keeps asking for it. Then I added a Dry Bones carousel and he kept asking for it even more. If Odyssey could have Dark Souls level, RTY could have a Metal Gear Solid level. Odyssey had no Dark Souls level. What are you talking about? I Don't know it's the last time love nope I hate Celeste But a mountain level is fine, but like how would that work into this concept? Kind of a crash for alien tool what I Give you some sort of Donkey Kong themed level at some points I I Don't know about that like how a donkey can't play into this Watching your previous on a shell. It's really look amazing. I'm glad you enjoy it What are you looking for ideas for it just knows in general yeah, we need level themes I once in total I would like 10 or actually 12 we have 7 and Then out of those 12 we pick the best ones to do next And we only need seven more levels right so five ideas are going to be thrown into the garbage Ruined Kingdom No, it's a cringe let's play This is the Castlevania level I never played Castlevania, so I would not have gotten that reference In medieval there was the idea for a medieval level at some point, but for some reason it was discarded There's also an idea for a womp fortress where you just like Infiltrate a castle full of worms and swamps But I guess forms fortress literally already exists I Don't want the candy level Huge casino time level turned on the table as an obstacle poker chip store stuff like that a Casino is on my list of ideas here, but I was not thinking of making it oversized But casino levels are really fun to make I really like the one in 64 and Pace level is not a good idea unfortunately Neither is cum level I Want was I cast in the style of Mario Kart 64's nah lame Yeah, so a casino level hmm, I'll just like in brackets to like oversized But this feels so sonic right I don't want this game to be end up being sonic Subway Subway can be interesting Did you change to set up message queues and display view things functions anyway Probably let me just check what these are right now. I Do remember this function here, I guess I didn't change too much. I just always in line that and then there's the whole VI swapping thing Are you gonna infiltrate the government building and for your capture Luma no You need to stop by Sarah that's a reason I said it's a true Yeah, we literally just finished the airship level a Waterpark Like with water slides and stuff like that I feel like they are more fun to experience IRL than to go there in the game And I stumble we don't have a single ice base level So actually we there is kind of like a mandatory ice level We have to make there is the idea for the ice cream base level with like a train going around But it was just gonna be a side level No circus already have a zoo I did put your partner one of the levels. No We don't have a slide having level either yes, so While they're brainstorming ideas right now. I already have like a list of ideas that I want to appear in my levels maybe we can look at this list of random ideas and See if some of them inspire a level theme a Part that uses layer 4 and Fox shade alpha can figure in a way that the path only renders if it's close to the camera Which will give to cool appearing path illusion Okay, so this has to be like a dark area. I want to form skate park somewhere. I don't know why I just wanted that Sneak Yoshi, I guess not really a Room made out of breaking boxes. I just really like that when you just have a room that can completely break Start as friendly Chuck is to just chuck you to what's the goal? Cave with calculated CPU based lighting so I want a dark cave Stardust are you rolling on a ball with reds on it? Oh, yeah, you remember the egg that you roll around and then hatch I Want that somewhere a Block Puzzle where you ground-pound the floor and it flips the tiles and turns the lights on so it becomes a cool pixel art I like that too and The level of cannons shooting you No, Lilaa that one sucks I Can't make it a surfing game What? I'm gonna let's set in a factory that's hidden Within this snowy environment far off the grid it on with all sorts of mushroom kingdom residences workers I feel like I've heard that idea before in a roaming called dark collab I wonder Lilaa Wasn't all I feel amazingly takes place on an oil recovery snow. Oh shit that reminds me that was There was one level theme. I saw in a sonic level that I wanted was it the oil level That already existed in causes warmup, I think We're not adding another surfing minigame there's already one Show you Wrong level All right, we already have two surfing minigame we don't need another I Killed him I Don't seem so wrong about pancake. No, that's kind of a Uninteresting and not very all-encompassing theme I Really what's the issue for sauna? What a tunnel It's often sensation really hard so the bobbing from the running I'm super muted That doesn't happen on my end, I think you interpolate differently than me I Mean as well as making a star for stopping. Well, that's kind of what the Western world is right where you just hunt out loss Space out of our gravity the space level is only once and that is to find a level Also low gravity levels are kind of really not fun to run around in I Press garden act 2 from Sonic mania such a cool high-level theme press garden act 2. Let's see that That takes place in a cave or something like that This doesn't look like an oh my god, this is so ugly I Spoke if I was like going from America at the s we have a swamp level plant, which is basically that Times in our to I to I don't see it happening for sauna I'll need like a video or something But a food related world nah We already had like a food level and lost impacts. I don't want another I Think they're overdone Can we do an old temple somehow Because a lot of these ideas would work for an old temple a lot of these ideas are kind of gloomy I Could we just make a fucking city somehow like a modern is actually very just a comic based world The skate park should be in the comic based world If there's gonna be a foam skate park it should be here I Snow pick mention from Zelda. It's that's in Twilight Princess that one What about toxic first? I'm not again the valley of the wind just like we say study Let's see that I already have athletics plan so What Am I looking at the right thing Taking answer from Mario Kart, maybe something about insects or Yoshi money. Yeah. Yeah, and we already have to plant we have And Where's it right here Wild West Valley with cowboys and the Yoshi Valley Pookie surrounds that's kind of inspired by that. That's how I got that idea In parallel universes is too weird for a level theme Now We don't want too many gloomy level sonic that's like Or that's been an issue before What can we also have the cave level course free with the ship level course five? we have All alone bumbledome course eight or something so free gloomy levels is already kind of a lot Hello better true better you are a mod Ski-lodge themed here. She's like, oh, right. There was a Yoshi's Islands level where you were and she's But I don't think she's complement the core gameplay of Mario 64 very well They are fun as light as still I Mean a nice level could have really cool slides. I Don't want gloomy levels anymore no Abandoned ruins I was thinking a temple could kind of work too, which is very similar to abandoned ruins You have song has enabled do you care about copyrighted music? Um, no And give their own role-making would be good to start with but game that would give me more else what do you think That depends on what you want to learn epic What's your goal here A Retro futuristic level like a steampunk time level. That's really hard to 3d models. Holy shit I don't know if I can do a good version of that Shit I forgot to enable alerts I should have done that Jetsons, okay. I'll look up what Jetsons is What the fuck am I looking at this is the Flintstones Biobak could do the work for me. I'm not just gonna ask Biobak. Hey, just do like 200 hours of unpaid labor from you, please Thank you Giant Tower that doesn't work as like a level that's like the tick the clock ish away run the same thing up 15 times Thank you for the 550 I I don't want people do have to pay or watch ads for games. I just want to make good games If you just want to make good games that a lot of people play Role-making is your way because if you make official games, no one's gonna play them unless they're really really good or you market them. Well Hello, Sailor Cherry First time live for you. Oh, welcome We're currently and you're gonna like this We are brainstorming ideas for the next five courses because we are on the last overworld and return to Yoshi's Island I just finished all the logic for the bowser fight We're now waiting for the animations Zeina's making them then we're doing the VFX and SFX Yeah, and after that everything in the first two overworlds is done and we're safe to move on to overworld 3 I Promise you it's gonna look cool So there's gonna be eight levels in total in the third overworld. We have eight level ideas right now I want at least like 13 14 so that We can discard the bad ones and only pick the best ones What do you think of the Mario movie that was pretty cool I Think too special but I had fun Oh nation, thank you for the donation better and I'm sure there's a song with it Okay I like the Kongs in a Mario movie, but like why why they're so Mario Kart obsessed. How did that make any sense? This fight took really long to like come up with we have to spend so much time just like Thinking about what to do I'm getting my ass kicked So Manager the way to go since you have no coding That depends on how much time you want to spend if you are determined to like spend the next 100 hours on it Then you should do decomp If you just want to spend to die on it, then Roman just fine Nice matrix, thank you. I know that there's issues What's with the baby Yoshi apparition you need this one during the level Basically, you can tongue any point in the level and just like shoot yourself to what's it? But you recommend to definitely decomp I Mean I I told you under which conditions decomp would be favorable and the which Ramesh I would be You just need to figure out which one's your situation oh Oh My god, these are so hard to dodge I didn't realize that There's a combo left there This music is kind of fitting for the fight I Alright blasted if we had this one we win The bitch is that And he's gone you proved out of existence he still needs to spawn a star and stuff Since every time you should be another course orienting on the nest Yoshi's Island game would be called ever cast a theme course But not a suppose a castle Yeah Hey, yeah But which castles were Daniel? She's silent. I don't want to book us So I don't want to haunted castle cuz really after haunted house for the haunted boat It's not your first you could have ended the final hit and so on and I know I'm very sorry If any level with Monty molds in it, you could do a level based off mobile from Mario RPG No, I don't think actually yeah, we have to rocky wrenches in this level It's almost answering grabs the wall then waits a second then flings you forward just more set for a legend I Don't know. I don't know I Will that is a giant clock in the middle like tick-tock clock How about a shame in mountainside level several amounts and Cooper monks, there's already the divine Dino domain which has a Shaman type Yoshi that gives you tips I Go to peak we have a dojo already. So that themes also kind of in their museum Museums are so boring. Why would you want a museum level? Why don't we have a level like about filling out your taxes How about a level where you go to work? And you don't customer service you just serve people at McDonald's for an hour, that's the level But middle-aged Chris Simmons or dark age well, then you go racing Yeah, a medieval Chris would be very cool We should probably know this idea down, but I'm not really sure like how we're gonna make this work Who would be in this medieval level would it be like Coopers and armors We're not doing crystal caverns I'm just streaming on YouTube, which is that I hate which is so many ads. I can't stand it anymore Okay, but Luigi's Mansion 3 is very different Luigi's Mansion 3 is not a platformer If charging Chuck's this night, I don't like Mario world So, I don't want to reference that I want to just reference Yoshi's Island We can avoid quoting our organization and we cannot do that by the way, you guys wanna See this game run on n64 real quick. I Tested this earlier. Okay. See there's there's the thing. I wanted to show you guys on the case clips channel today Which we're on right now. I wanted to show you guys my new 20 FPS Interpolation that makes 20 FPS look smooth, but look at the game like Even on widescreen modes the game now runs so well that I just can't get the FPS that low I Remember when I made this level here and people were like our case this I was so complicated the n64 can run this And now it's like yeah, I can't even get below 30 FPS And this is still widescreen modes I Yeah, I'm just way too like the performance here is just way too good It's very level you've made so far in our QA. It's always the last one I mean Snow sky theme. Well, wait, this is on its no sky All right to see lifts Okay Pushing snowballs to jump out on them. I'd like to make them bigger. It's so cool. I like that. That's a neat mechanic How about a castle with a giant clock in the middle and you have to wait for a time for something to happen The waiting is not a very fun mechanic So that's Chris going to be Rainbow Road, no, I don't want Rainbow Road not again Rainbow what is like the final level in every other Mario game I feel or aromic Okay Casino level is on our block of ideas You'll set the fire and ice mechanics here Mmm, I don't see that but I don't want to fire somebody like yes, that's also very overdone already. I Have never committed arson I Will be course 11 course 11 will be frantic fleet factory This will be the level where bozos minions are Working on building airships for Bowser It's gonna be a snow level it has some kind of secondary theme I absolutely agree a snow level cannot be the only theme If we have a snow level we would just combine it with like the medieval level or something Abandoned fridge You're really going over how you learn to program. I Literally didn't learn I just looked at it and was able to do it I'm what fast forwarding and rewinding is like looking milk. Also, no Resume Music park is cool But the problem is Scallops already made a music level and I really really don't want to do like the same theme There's so many cool ideas you could do with the music level to I Just don't know how bad the results are at first I Mean if the results are bad just like Keep working on it until the results are good. Like just remake the thing until it's good That's the best way to learn to just make one thing really really good I'm sorry. Anyway, you have to stop the island from falling. We're doing where it's asked once actually fun. I'm not a blurry boy once So everything would be like on a death timer It sounds not like what people would find fun Japanese are always cherry blossoms. That's some weeb shit Also making cherry blossom trees like that and the n64 it's not gonna be cheap And I'm using random mechanics, but they're just spam giant instruments true actually Yeah, maybe we can make a good music level there was one in 64 land as well that was not terrible Okay, we'll note down the music idea music level Music it's gonna be difficult to organize this with Badub, but I think it should work Level I realize on the load on shooting it so they can I actually have a block of ideas Further up here or stuff that I want to appear in the levels And Level the cocaine and shooting you around is on my block of ideas that I want somewhere So the massive tree for a star starts and roots while finishing once take place in a tree And we have a level that is on giant trees But culture themes are a good idea a Chinese ones when Chris with Chinese fragrance entered hunger coming We have a Chinese wall and white levels in through the ages. So I literally already did that and the last I got released The Scanner was sauce that cut down with the platforms and just the general the home depot process Huh Sky level with wooden platform. I mean we have the giant trees that are in the sky. It's like too much overlap Yeah, and that's actually a point something like tiny huge islands is really cool And I want the level at least one level with a mechanic kinda like that When you switch between two versions of the same world That that should be like absolutely an idea that we know it done It can be like a future present world or future past world. Although we already have a past world. So What would work well for that level Between two versions of the same place Night day night day is not not big enough of a difference Such a dark light or hard corner because yeah, I don't want dark light or hard cold either. I Don't know what subcon is. It's then little like that's a suck. That's a ligma. I'm not asking what's up gun Do not explain subcon to me I Big small music. Oh The music level would let you check. Okay, you know what? I like the idea of changing the BPM in the music level, but that shouldn't be a separate level Maybe there's one act in this that's really fast and you can access new places Some are too. All right subcon Mario What the fuck I mean, he was no supervision. That's also kind of lame. I Mean there is a level about changing the The time of year in Banjo-Kazooie kind of works, but it's not really a drastic change Dude if we make the level we change between two versions we could have Koopas in one and rivals in the other One would be like the normal world and then the other is like the ghost world But it actually sounds kind of like stranger things That's kind of cringe. I don't want to reference stranger things Oh Like in Skyward Sword where it's like the spring with all the grass and then there's the desert I Could absolutely do that actually not that I think about it. I could literally make the same mechanic where you Travel within a piece that prevents the time in a radius around it I Don't like Alice in Wonderland when I'm doing that Prison escape is also not a fun theme No one likes sneaking around that much in Mario one sneaking around mission is fine, but I don't think like six of them are Oh Highway can make yeah. Yeah. Oh Lanairo is that one from Skyward Sword? I don't even know that Yeah, okay, that's what I was thinking of as well So since it's a really further potion and the random door appears and sends you to a mirror world Okay, never really played Mario Bros 2. I Guess something that could kind of work Castle with changing temperatures Or like a hot cold castle We kind of want to not use the hot cold thing that's so obvious What are some of the most? Essential opposites that we encounter in our daily world Hot cold dark light. Yeah, I guess Side temperature what else there? Hearing one really loud world one really quiet world Smelling what really stinky world one not stinky world I Was thinking of senses Sweet and salty one sweet world one salty. Well, okay. These are all bad. These are all bad Happy and sad I Know no, I'm not happy said it doesn't work Maybe take a page out of hi-fi rush and reward attacks on the meat. Nope. We're not doing that. That is not Mario Slow and fast actually slow and fast is a good one. Oh, but it's kind of it's kind of just like tick tock clock, right? It's like tick tock clock but with the dynamic clock speeds. That's kind of boring. No, that's too close. You already do that in the original Time mechanic for medieval and future And what would change like what would be an object that is one way in medieval and the other in future Right, if we do that we need every moving object that we have to have like an exact antagonist in the other version and We're not making an entire sticky world Well, never what that is what it would be Franco, but that's not different enough to be interesting that's not neat Upside-down a level that changes up and down around whenever you like switch sides. It kind of works, but It's like really hard to design for It's pretty limiting Good future a bad future. Nah And beehive and beehive level is cool. We already made one on lost impact. Oh, I don't really have many new ideas about over that You think a past future level could be cool like industrial factory type world versus primitive Yeah, but we won't need a good setting for that where each ancient thing has like a modern counterpart a Level entirely inside a train. It's kind of fun, too But a train is so linear that it doesn't really work just insects in general, it's not very cute It's very easy, yes shallow, you just need to install it that's the hard part Minimalism is a colorful doesn't work. I don't this guy we can switch the slides upside down by jumping from the island. I Don't want like an upside-down switch thing. I also don't really see how that works out right now Someone Mentioned the color is no color level Maybe a forest with monochromatic areas like the Buckley woods from TTYD and then the other things that are colorful There is Underwear that's on its coat We Could have a level where one version is like the overworld and then the other one is like the underworld Well, they're creepy dark shit like this. I think it kind of works And then in one world that would be Things blocking your way and the other one is really dangerous. So you don't want to be in it It would kind of be like heaven hell I guess Demon was from ours. It's kind of like Mario Odyssey. Yeah Now 15 levels not 16. Yeah, exactly haunted and normal But we would need a good place for this Haunted normal world would have to tie in with another theme Oh Dude yes, what if What if you had to enter mirrors to change the worlds, oh my god, that is such a that's a crazy idea Wait a second It could not work with the medieval castle you mentioned there's like the medieval castle and over the castle There's mirrors all where everywhere and you can enter a mirror to like change into the haunted version That is like really dangerous and at the haunted version like most of the geometry is missing and like there's no floor and you have to platform over like dark shit over the abyss Curse mirror. No, I don't want to steal robots egg It kind of fits too because we did want Like if we go with the Yoshi's Island thing, there are a bunch of castles in Yoshi's Island and some of them are haunted It could be like a friendly castle on one side and like the really bad one on the other one Let's see all the bosses in Yoshi's Island and see what kind of castle would work for this How would the mirrors look they would mirror Mario like you would have a mirror here and then you would have Mario here on one side and You would just see the normal level on one side and then the other one you would see the fucked up version So it wouldn't be a perfect mirror. Just kind of Mario would be mirrored and the level behind it looks a bit different I Think naval piranha is like no, but we already have two piranha bosses. I don't want a third one Don't know when chain jumps fall from the sky yet. Those are stable Yoshi's Island thing. Oh, you're right They are oh But they fall through the floor and break the floor and it's that's possible But I feel like that works more 2d Yeah, it's like an actual evil mirror thing Is that in 2-4 is what you're saying Which one's this The boom castle The Chimps are acting like those painting walnuts from Banjo-Kazooie. I don't know them Picasso 2-8 Which one's this is this the pants guy and 4-8 This is Oh the Cooper Hmm and really I just want to like decide whose castle this will be First before we do anything because if we do want to go with the mirror being in the castle We can still like decide that this is not gonna be a concept that we do for the medieval level We can still decide that this will be like a different theme You Can one of the floor and ceiling smelter it really work for you setting needed Those are kind of we can't enemy not powerful enough to be scary jump castle. Oh and jump castle could work well But if this is like the dark world like what kind of Mario enemies would fit into like the underworld the dark world Oh Wait, this is just gonna be it's just gonna be this Fanta who's that? I don't know all these Mario side games son Raven that's like the fuzzy guy Oh What kind of what what normal enemy is this isn't he like an oversized version of a normal enemy What's like a small enemy version of this Okay, you know what a Raven castle sounds kind of cool they fit the underworld I think this is the best fit yeah Raven Castle and probably the happy version of it Fanto from Super Mario Bros 2 I Don't know this one. Oh, it's the mask I Didn't play Yoshi's story, but I really should It's this in Ah You just go to tomorrow we can use a random page button for ideas no Then I miss you completing that off the floating moon. Yeah, that was a while ago. That was like two levels ago Duplicate ghosts, let's check those. Oh But these are paper Mario guys Or do they appear in a Yoshi game Wait, that's the wrong level. Here you go style Yeah, there's too many ads on Twitch that's why I switched to YouTube YouTube's a lot more watchable if you ask me We're gonna have a few less viewers the first few streams, but that's fine it is the better long-term decision I think I'm gonna have a few less viewers the first few streams, but that's fine. It is the better long-term decision, I think It's also kind of rips its creators off they kind of like taken over 50% cut which really that's like when they get us Come in the mirrors with the eyes of all it's been more similar to the Yoshi games. I think we could have to play ghosts Now paper Mario's not similar I don't like that We used to see goals, I'm actually there were seagulls in the level just now the Goonies You guys don't have you plug origin Ad block for YouTube ad block plus ad block you block origin Better twitch.tv sponsor block for YouTube. It doesn't block the ads on Twitch. I have eight or nine ad blockers Yeah, that's fine for you see Could you implement something like the strips from partisan time darkest head castle I Can implement whatever I want, but I don't want that one Yeah Yeah, we could just make loose yeah, yeah Yeah, if we could just make it like a happy version of the Ravens like friendly ones that would work well If we go with the medieval castle Idea then the haunted world should be like a problem for everyone else. How can that work? We need to have like a friendly version. The main level needs to be friendly. The story needs, or if there is a story in this level, it needs to reference that the haunted world is being a problem. Otherwise I don't see this working out. Every level is a Yoshi level. Hello Goody Pop. I don't know why you're here. That is very unlucky. Penguins or like a penguin castle on one side and the raven castle on the other. Like as a reference to the Mario movie it kind of works. Would it be an ice palace on the one side? This doesn't feel like a mirror image anymore. Although considering the places that the ravens show up, shit like this, it very much fits that they live in a fucked up bizarro world. The music level is already on the block here for an idea. Are we talking about the main enemy if I ask? Well the main enemy in the castle level would be the ravens if we went with the mirror idea. I'll just reiterate. We're planning to make a level that has two sides to it. The same as Tiny Huge Island, there's a small side and a big side. For this we thought maybe it'd be cool if the way you switch sides was through a mirror and one side of the mirror was the haunted world and the other side of the mirror was the happy world. So we were thinking of making the haunted world be like the world full of these raven enemies here and the whole level would be falling apart in the mirrors and the happy world has to be something else. I think it doesn't work with the castle. I think it needs to be something else. I think the castle theme is too limiting in what we can do. So what are friendly birds like Pidgeots from Mario 2 or Hoots from Mario Odyssey? Pidgeots. They are friendly? I thought they were enemies. Yeah, exactly, Paul. So maybe you can reference that big guy in the early Yoshi's Island beta from Giga Leaks? I don't know that one. Send me an image and I can look at it. Can write them without killing them? I never realized. Those birds are enemies.  And we still think about the level themes as you name the stream, the thing I will add is at this point. No. This is development. Wait, you think just because we aren't actively programming, this is not actually productive? Making decisions is like the most important thing of making a game. No matter how hard you work, if you don't make good decisions, your game's gonna be shit. So us taking the time to make the best decisions for what the level theme should be is very valuable to the final game. This makes or breaks the game. This can make the game 10 times better or 10 times worse, depending on whether we do a good job.  Let me see who that is. Who? Okay, this guy came out after the N64, so we can't use him. Paper Mario Quizzle is not planned, but there is a Paper Mario retro level planned, so it's a single star. There's a different sort of castle design. No, I think we need something other than a castle altogether. So if it's the ravens with like the dark world, the dark world can be anywhere. It can be literally a grassy land and a dark world would make sense. Can be just like a mushroom forest. Maybe it's a medieval wildland with mushrooms and forests and everywhere that ruin ghost towns. Can be forests that swap in the dark world. I think the only way having a dark world makes sense is if we force the player to go through the dark world to get up somewhere. So there needs to be platforming mechanics that only really work in the dark world. And if we have a town, there's going to be no way for us to stop the player from just walking everywhere in the happy world. So I think that doesn't quite work. Super Donkey, that's what he's called. I'm not going to find Super Donkey. Hello Nintendo for life. Wild West Valley is really cool. Frantic Fleet Factory is really cool. The Super Hero comic book level is really cool. So three of these levels are basically set in stone. We're really just thinking about what the last two levels should be. The music level I like. Man, I also really like the casino level though. I think the computer level has to go. Is there anywhere we can find something that's taking place in space? Maybe the dark world could have low breath. Which means it was not used successively. Yeah. That could be interesting. And that could allow the player to get to further locations. That would be a good way to do that. So I think we scratch this. I don't think medieval works out. You know what the problem is? Now we have six themes that I all kind of like. And we have to pick five of them. Maybe we can combine this idea with one of our other levels. A dark side to a casino doesn't really work out. A dark side to a Super Hero comic book level kind of works. A dark side to Wild West Valley doesn't work. It doesn't work. It has to be the music level or the comic book level that would have a dark side. Casino and music can be fused too, yes. But they are both giant themes on their own. I absolutely want the Wildestun world to stay. The idea of playing detective and finding outlaws to catch them is so cool that I don't want to change that. The Dark World theme does fit the best in a comic book level if you ask me. Why not putting low FPS animation on purpose? That looks awful. I don't want the comic book level to be low FPS. No! I don't want that. Instead of time travel and a relentless idea. I mean, that would be the haunted happy idea that this kind of turned into. I don't want that later. That's going to look so bad. I know what they mean, but I hate that. I don't want characters to animate at low FPS. No, the Western is going to be the detective thing. The superhero one is just going to be you being a superhero. Running around on skyscrapers. Grinding along railings. There's going to be some sort of villain here. And if the villain was the raven, I think that would work out. Would there be a normal version of the city and a haunted version? And then in the haunted version the gravity would be lower because it's the raven world. And you could jump on the skyscrapers. And it would also be full of villains. And it would drain your health quickly if you weren't there. Something like that. I think that works. I'll note this down for now. This is all we really need. Did you know the ancient cistern from Skyward Sword? It also has the Buddhist and death theme switching in one place. Ancient cistern. Let's see that. I think I've seen this boss, yeah. I barely remember Skyward Sword. I did not like the game a lot. All I remember about Skyward Sword is the stupid boss, the banished one, that just keeps showing up. And it's such a boring boss fight. It's like the same boss four times. Anyway, I think we have our five themes. Let's put them in order. So we have the frantic fleet factory first. The next we have the wild west valley, I think. The music level should be course 13. Toilet level. That's not an idea, by the way. That's just what ancient cistern is. It's a toilet level. Okay. I don't really know Batman nor shit like that. I don't watch superhero movies. So the Bowser minion training ground is gone. This doesn't exist anymore. Instead it is the Frantic Fleet Factory. All right, let's go over the Frantic Fleet Factory real quick. And then we decide what's actually going to be happening in here. Well, I mean, most of what's happening in here is already decided. So this is a factory full of enemies. And the goal for Mario is to sabotage the building. All the enemies wear helmets, so you can't kill them by jumping on them. We have to give the player some kind of explanation why jumping on them doesn't kill them. If you do, maybe they give you a text telling you don't do that. So you fuck off with that. The first mission is about messing with the troops. They make them strike against their work conditions. After every mess up, you have an overseer get more upset and he turns red. It should be a Wiggler. And after you do that five times, you get a star. The first one is someone is on a seesaw like this. They're standing at the front. At the back, there's a box. You, like, gromp out the box and the seesaw just falls off forward. They just land with their face in the mud. And it's a group of thwomps. You push one over. They all fall like dominoes. You have a pool of cement you run through to make, like, footsteps into them. You have people carrying a piece of glass and you just smash through it. You kick an oil barrel and it makes people slip. You get a star for that. The second one, the minions made a roadblock and are striking. Which leads to a new platforming machine that you can use to reach a crane that you can control. And with that crane, it just starts like a cutscene once you're on the crane. And it just knocks over the Bowser statue. Third message, third star, is Bowser sends a boss enemy to break the strike. And you have to beat the enemy to get the star. And in mission 4, they're all back to work. Everything's back to normal. And the Bowser statue is destroyed. The red coin mission here is gonna be some sort of construction beam thing with hanging crane ropes, swinging platforms, stuff like that. It's like a half-constructed building that you run around in. And then there's a bunch of locations. I wrote it down. Scaffolding. I don't know what a scaffolding is, actually. Network of scaffolding and platforms. Climb and jump to reach new areas. A crane climb. Series of towering cranes using hooks, beams and cables to split obstacles. Half-built structures. Storage room. An excavation pit. Demolition zone. Partially demolished building, collapsing walls, floors and dumpers that create dynamic platform challenges. Also, as you can see, Bowser... Yeah, this was a really funny idea we had. There's gonna be an office. And you can see Bowser through the office, right? This is after you beat him in the boss fight. After you destroyed Bowser's entire flying armada in the boss fight. And you can just see Bowser through a window. And maybe a text pops up and he's like, Ben, I hate that Mario. I hate him. I hate him. And then when you enter, there will just be a text going like, Who's there? Leave me alone. Let me... What's the word? Let me be upset in peace. Let me be brutal in peace. And there'll be broken airships, cranes, stuff like that. Platforms on hooks. Hooks. Seesaw platforms. I suppose I'm gonna be screaming at his minions or something. Well, Bowser does send a strike breaker, so... So what's the 8-bit pipe here? Cannon. Oh yeah, there definitely should be cannon. Cannons to shoot between buildings. I can use this idea for that. Whoops, I don't want this one. That was my workout thing. That was the wrong button. I don't know. By the back end of the strike section, he's gonna have fun with that. He's fringed. They're gonna have Bowser's hat on in guillotine. Just Koopas in Guy Fawkes masks. I don't know. I think this is perfect so far. There should be a half-finished house that you can just completely demolish. You can just ramp on that and everything fucking breaks. Wait, I didn't even think of that. We had a few ideas already noted down. Hotel Mario, Mario Paint, Yoshi Safari, Smash 64, Mario Land 1, Yoshi's Story, Paper Mario, Wario Land. These are the ones we should put in here. Let me actually assign these right now. Like, why not? This is on the K-Slips channel, cheap dip. That's why. So, if you want a house that you can completely demolish. Like, you can just destroy it from the top to bottom. How is the best way to do this? We need to have, like, boxes that look breakable. Let's see.   Is there something in Odyssey like this? Of course. Oh, wait. Wait, this is perfect. We could have these types of breakable blocks. And there's just, like, a house built out of them and you just destroy them all. No, imagine, like, a house built on blocks. One half is breakable, the other one is not breakable. And you destroy the breakable half and the house just fucking falls over and demolishes. Something like that is what I'm thinking. It is gonna be somewhat demanding, yes. But it's not that big a deal. It can also just be a separate area where it wouldn't matter. Yeah. Music doesn't take that much space. Hmm. Wait, it's saying that my monetization is off on the stream. What the fuck? It's not 4 megabytes, it's like 2. And also, that's what the megabytes are for, for music. Hmm. Something made out of breakable blocks will destroy them. What will they be? The best of it was something for Bowser. Yeah. Breaking one block for a star is a bit boring. Like, just a single block and it destroys everything. It's very boring. Leveling is abided by the Lord of the Rings. There is nothing inspiring in the Lord of the Rings. It's just the most generic fantasy world ever. And it's probably because every fantasy world is based on the Lord of the Rings. But still, they're so basic. Also, nah, this is his airship factory. It should be like a Bowser statue or something. But when you have a Bowser statue, you knock it over. Maybe this breakable block idea just doesn't work out. Maybe this isn't as fun as I'm thinking. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe there should just be a huge pile of these. Honestly, yeah. This is the construction zone, there should just be like piles of materials. And you just destroy all of them. And a star somewhere in there. Honestly, it seems like kind of a boring star, but we need a few simple stars like that. We're not having a hold on Mario level. Alright, let's distribute these. Smash 64 bought the platforms, seems like the most valuable contender here. Although Mario Land 1 might also work well for something. I don't think Mario Land 1 works well here though, so I'm putting bought the platforms into this one here. The Wild West Valley, Mario Land 1, Yoshi's Story, Paper Mario 64 or Wario Land 1 are our options. Now these ideas are too contrived, it's not elegant and simple. All these ideas have to be easy to understand, so it's actually like a game you play and not like a movie you watch. What's the most iconic level in Mario Land 1? We already have a Mario Land 2 retro level, so that doesn't work. Oh, so this is just kind of a beach. Man, this is so bizarre looking though. It's like, do I really want a Mario Land 1 retro level? But what else am I gonna use? Actually, let's see Wrecking Crew. Maybe we can just make a Wrecking Crew. This looks like ass. Virtual Boy Wario Land. Oh boy. Marine Pop level. Oh, that's Super Mario Land, I see. Do we already have Wario's Castle? Yes. Here's Wario Land 3, it has more vibrant colors and a diverse landscape. Now we have to use the first one. It has to be during the N64 time. None of these are actually Mario platforming. It doesn't work. It's also Mario Land, not Wario Land, is it? We need Wario Land. But I think Wario Land might just be bad. So, what's the Mario game? And watch when you actually like the Mario stuff. This is not what I want. Is this a retro game? No. It's still weird, we can't do that. We can't just put the weirdest shit ever in the game. Which one of these actually have Mario in it? I don't know. Mario's Cement Factory. Oh god. No. No, I don't have any hopes for any of these. Hello, CK Def. Wario Land doesn't fit very well. Exactly, that's why I'm looking for a replacement right now. I think Wario Land is just very weird looking. Cement Factory in Wrecking Crew? Okay. Cement Factory. Let's look at that. But this doesn't have like sprites or anything, does it? It's just kinda... Is this even a Mario game? Where's Mario? Yes, Mario Land is planned. Right now on my block is Mario Land, Yoshi's Story, Paper Mario 64, and Wario Land 1. And there was Smash 64 for both platforms. We already did all the good games that came before the N64, so we're getting very desperate here. Because we need 15 retro levels. Let's see. What's the other one? Demolition Crew? Wrecking Crew. This one just looks so ugly, right? Oh, but there's a Mario. What the fuck? What am I even looking at here? What is this supposed to be? I don't want Donkey Kong. You can use Donkey Kong on the Game Boy. Already dead. Bob-omb Factory from Mario Party 9. It's not very retro. DK94. It's basically the same game, right? Or is Bombs Away? Doesn't look like a very platforming game, does it? I don't know about Wrecking Crew. I don't want to include more than one level from Yoshi's Island. Every game only gets one retro course. It's part of the fun. The problems with Wrecking Crew is just so unrecognizable, luckily. There is a Mario RPG level. I can show you real quick. The idea with the retro pipes is that you enter a level and you're excited. Like, oh my god, I wonder what the retro level is going to be in this one. That's not where the retro pipe is. It's over there. Right, so then once you find the retro level, you're like, oh my god, it's this old game that I used to love. It looks so cool in Mario 64, to just see the sprite-based thing in 3D. Wow. How are you supposed to get up here? Wait, I'm sure that was a plan. I feel like there used to be a pipe here and I just messed it up somehow. Or a trampoline. Nope, that was definitely a warp here. Okay, so the warp is broken, but the idea stands. Yeah, I kind of broke all the warps. Oh well, it's fine. The warps are gone, but you get the idea. Yeah, I kind of want to do a virtual boy pipe, but like, which virtual boy game would be good here? I don't want to do Wario Land. It has to be something else. Hmm. Mario Clash. It doesn't really have any sprites to run around on.  Super Mario's Wacky Worlds. Is that even a real game? That sounds like a ROM hack. Wait, what? That's a real thing? Okay, well there isn't really anything I can do about this though. I have no sprites, nothing. Is that like the same game still?  Hotel Mario was an idea on my list, but I couldn't figure out how to make a good level out of that. Like, how do you make a platforming level out of this shit? NES Wario Woods? Oh. Oh, it's one of those games. Well, I mean, at that point I'd rather do Dr. Mario. But Dr. Mario had the same issue where I couldn't really think of anything. I guess we could do Dr. Mario. And just have the player platform on pills. I guess Dr. Mario could be a really fun speedrunning challenge. You'd have a level that is made out of pills, and from the top you'd see pills come down, and you'd have to be fast enough. Or if you were too slow, the level would get harder. Let's do that, fuck it. Dr. Mario-based level. Pills from the sky. You are too slow. The pills disappear from the falling pill. We'll do that. Dr. Mario is recognizable enough. We don't need this list anymore. So the Wild West Valley would be... Now we need to assign them. I think the Wild West Valley works well with Paper Mario. Comic-based world, probably Mario Land. Casino level. We have Yoshi's Story and the Dr. Mario level. From Mario Party, is that too late in the timeline? No, it would kinda fit. Which level of Mario Party are you thinking of? Should be Mario Party 1, but how do you even... There isn't really any sprites or anything to use here, right? True, Sailor. Dr. Mario and Mario Paint. Well, how do you make a Mario Paint-themed level, though? We're bouncing on music notes or dodging a fly swatter. We're bouncing on music notes or dodging a fly swatter. I mean, we'd have to make the level out of the sprites, though, for it to be recognizable. That's kinda like the idea with the 2D sections. And there aren't really any sprites for us to use. Yeah, that also works, Limington. Although that's a bit difficult, because that would require the camera to see what's above you. Right? For you to not get crashed and for it to be fun. Because you don't have peripheral vision like that. You don't see 180 degrees around you. That being said, I think the Dr. Mario level fits well in the casino. And the music level would have to just, in the end, take the Yoshi Story level. Unless we said, you know what, the music level, I think this kinda works really well for Mario Paint. Which it does. This works, like, way too well with the Mario Paint composer thing. But how do you make a retro level out of it? So, okay. Would this just be, like, random fucking notes like this? And there would be a side-scrolling thing? And you'd have to jump on them? And then the music plays as you go? And the camera's just a forced perspective from the side? What? Which song would we play, though? What's a good theme? Mario Paint, Bob-omb Battlefield? Okay. These symbols are gonna be hard to platform on. But it would work if we just made them, like, blocks. Mario Paint theme. Is this the main theme? Where's the main theme? The notes need to kinda match up. This is gonna be really difficult to make. Creative exercise. Okay, but we need this to be remade inside the composer in Mario Paint. Oh. Oh, okay. Okay. It would sound like this. How am I gonna make this level, though? Am I supposed to copy all the notes here? How do you expect me to do that? Okay. Just have the song play in the background? And what's the platforming gonna be? Yeah, it's not fun gameplay-wise, I agree. But it's very cool thematically. Okay. Write a program that does it for you? I don't wanna do that! For one star? You're crazy. Jump to the beat? Also very boring. Just have the platforming be whatever. Just have the notes be whatever. What if we just make garbage notes? And we just design the notes for platforming instead of for sounding good. I've seen that there were demo songs as well. What if we use one of those? Pfft. Dreamcatcher makes every bit of Mario paint? That's literally what I did. Okay. Okay, what if we say, fuck all of this. What we do is, it's gonna be 3D. Okay. It's gonna be not just the 2D side-scrolling thing. It's gonna be a 3D thing, right? So there's gonna be four lines or five lines in the note thing. And they're gonna be wide. And there's gonna be a bunch of different platforms. And they all make a sound when you jump onto them. And you can jump on them in any order you want. It's just gonna make a bunch of funny noises. I think I prefer that. That's also easier for me. And you can actually just make up songs with Mario. Okay. I don't know what I'm on. It's going pretty well. So you turn off the Krabble Krabble and have a pitch. I don't know what that means. There will just be 12 notes. From C to C. And you can just play the 12 notes. And you can just play the 12 notes. All right. With that. We have all the retrocourses divided to all the levels. We know all the retrocourses now. We know all the level themes now. Next step is gonna be sketching out the 2D overview of how the Frantic Fleet Factory is gonna look like. And we're gonna have to then make like a basic layout. Start making the level. Put things in the level. This is gonna be fun. But I think even though we didn't draw a single polygon today. I think we made a lot of progress. This was very productive. And that's it for today. I will see you guys on the next Saturday. Maybe if you're lucky I'm gonna stream on Monday. I'm not sure. Until then. Bye bye. Bye bye.
