Hello, hello. It is finally time to start deciding the art style for Chris XI. We're gonna have fun today, I think, hopefully. Hello Mr. Crash. Hello PPL Khachova. What a fucking name. Hello Notorandom. Hello Oshk. Hello Limington. It's a factory, it's called Frantic Fleet Factory, but it's not really factory themed. It's construction zone themed. You bought an N64 today just to play this hack? That is pretty cool. That's cool. Yeah here's my Desktop. I'd like me some hofks, some good old hogs. So basically our goal today will be to decide on the art style for this level. I have made some sketches and I have some basic ideas of how I want the layout to be. I'm thinking this is kind of gonna be like Rico Harbor but instead of water it's gonna be lava and the buildings aren't finished. It's basically the idea. But we do need to decide on like some basic textures, some color schemes, stuff like that. We need to figure out what looks good together. Give, give what? Hello MarioLuigiSM64. So I always find this to be the most interesting but also the hardest part of making a level and that is getting the start. And basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna just make like a really, really small Can I include a steampunk area? It's not gonna be steampunk, no. But it is gonna be like rusty buildings, stuff like that. Which is steampunk adjacent I guess. Cases of boiling death, that could be a good idea. Wait what? Any OST wishes for today? What shall we listen to? Hello Lachlan Gibson. How are the dry bones going? What's going on in Bowser Factory or something like that? Can't really remember. It's called Frantic Fleet Factory and it's a construction zone with a bunch of Bowser minions around. It's not really a factory even though it's called Frantic Fleet Factory. It's more like a construction zone. Subnautica, let's do that. I am fine with that. This only has 1 hour and 40 minutes of OST. I thought this was gonna be like a 12 hour OST. The Deltarune OST is pretty hyped too. I kinda like it, but no. What's this thing just theme? Construction zone. So this is gonna be set on top of a volcano basically. France 64. This is not going to be like France at all. Will you be able to enter the volcano? Yes. That's where Bowser's office is. Okay. Hello, Death Bow. The protest zone? Oh, yes, yes. They are definitely... That is very French. They are out for Bowser's hat. In case of Zayna, if she's here. Zayna is not here. Zayna has to write thank you cards for everyone who came to our wedding like over a year ago because she didn't do that. Her mom is forcing her to finally do it. Who made the text just... Many, many people. Zayna is not here. These are just random rips from random games. Yo, it's some guy. What? Hello, Epic Legends. I have no idea who Mr. Mordor is. I never played Runescape. Okay. I was thinking something like this to be like the basic visual look of this. But now that I look at it, it feels a little boring. Let's look at this in-game. Have our level set up. Check out how this looks. Where is Zayna? She is at her parents' house. She has to write thank you cards. The text scroll thing must look missing. Missing. Thank you for the donation, Epic Legends. Very nice. I still haven't set up the donation thing. I'm... God, why didn't I do it? Tapasio. HD Worms Fortress is not done, no. That is waiting until later. Honestly, this visual is not that bad. It's kind of got something. Hello, big guy. I think you should do a brighter level. Yeah, this is another pretty grainy level, isn't it? How do we make a bright-looking volcano level, though? Can there be more colors? Yeah, that's what we're thinking about right now. We're just getting the basic idea of what the visuals should be like. Can I code in C++? I'm literally paid to do that, yes. Blue skies? Blue skies, you say? I'm not adding a snow level on top of a volcano. That... What? That doesn't make any sense. Elder Volcano is a bright level in Skyward Sword. Let's see that. Maybe this is a good inspiration. Oh. Okay. I kind of like it. You weren't bored, were you? Goodbye. Just go away. Welcome back to Legends of the Old Skyward Sword. We're playing. Yeah, this is the volcano. So this is fairly desaturated, actually. And that's how they made it bright. I feel like Mario is more about saturated colors. Well, that's a super cheap texture, but it looks good.  It's looking from a volcano if it's tall enough. It's, I think, way high up. True, true. Still. I don't want to just add a snow level. There's a... An arctic, like, cypress plant, but not a full level. Okay, so this is a good reference, this level. But I'm still not sold on the colors. It's still so monocolored, you know? It kind of looks like a desert. Yeah, exactly. So we have a few concept arts here. Of course, all this Mario Odyssey stuff for the constructions. Like a little excavator bit. All of this is also pretty dark. I really like the iron bars here. Or the wooden bars here. And this is the generic layout that I want. Kind of like Rickle Harbor, but with lava instead. And this is kind of the image I had in my mind. I played a bit of Serene Fusion, but I didn't like it. So I quit after, like, half an hour. So... Gravel pit. Oh. It's bright, but it's not colorful. That is from The Land Before Time. How the fuck could you tell? What? Okay. So really, the thing that made it bright is the really, really bright lava in there. We're not adding blue lava. That makes no sense, does it? Is blue lava real? What the fuck? Still, that doesn't feel right. Galactic Centralist orbital body gravity next, please. No. But it boasts a gnarly party. Let me see that. It's not very colorful either. It's about what we want, though. It's just not really helpful right now. Try making the factory infrastructure bright yellow. Yeah, we can probably work with the colors of the buildings here to make this a little better. Let me just finish making the lava pit here real quick. And then... We can put some buildings in the background. This is obviously not gonna be what the level looks like. This is just, like...             Me seeing what could work. Multimetal is often an almost bright yellow. That might help me if I mix that with the lava. Hmm. I'm not telling people this, though, no. Besides, we're thinking of colors right now. Unless you have an idea that you're pretty sure is really, really good. I don't really wanna hear it right now. Can we put some looking bullies in this level? I can't. I don't wanna. Does anyone remember Skellex? What happened to that guy? Does he still make mods? It's... He's, like, a bad topic to bring up, because there was, like, a lot of drama. A lot of really, really childish drama. Coming from his side. I think if you even say my name in, like, his vicinity, he will just, like, ban you from his Discord and stuff like that. But basically, he kinda lost his mind and stopped making hacks. This could be new for this type of level, actually, maybe, probably. Maybe. I mean, as enemies, yeah. They would fit on the... Yeah, yeah, actually. I'll make a note. Let me just go over the basic concept of what I want this level's layout to be. Let's see if you guys understand why I think bullies might be good. So, this is gonna be the generic layout. Most of this is above a lava pit, and there's gonna be... This this metal bar stuff that you run around and let me get Rico Harbaugh real quick right imagine this but like all these metal bars here but they are above lavas and then this is gonna be at the actual lava arena that you're walking on what was it knife tool what Alan Jackson would you ever reskin this game and release it on a shop I don't think I can the map is true program arts true and that you knew I'm sort of was a cabriolet just looks like a normal website defenses where they suppose in the background in the tree most of the polygons in the new ones fortress are at the top actually around the metal area I agree though that the 8k polygons definitely could be used but but that's a map that not a mate I'm not me that originally had 12,000 polygons I actually had to get it down to 8,000 people on the video were so mean he just said fuck it I don't want to make it anymore you guys can be mean to me though like I'm actually just a fucking psychopath I can't take it when people say all your game looks like dog shit but not everyone you know how do we make a level boundary here what about a thermal power plant somewhere powering the machinery yeah that would look cool I can note it down as a possible location okay now from star all well hopefully you do not I mean okay well I've literally drawn like three textures so you can't really get the vibe of the level from just this lava waterfall from boundary oh you mean like an entire lava waterfall around here so this would be half half a lake and half a lava waterfall that could work what is a bull can I send a lick ma it better not be a fucking lick ma bulking yes I'm back to bulking I cut from 215 to 197 like I stopped cutting like two or three weeks ago told you my idea for novel twice you just ignored it well what's your idea and why would I not ignore it I think it's good idea here if you added some that Yoshi scans around the places usually wonderful usually working room no I don't want that it's Cooper's construction zone like then there's no dad Yoshi's this is hey this is way too dark for a Mario game I can't respond to everything your lava level three how's this the third one wait what we have both this thing and then we have this the one balls on our come on the original game has more lava level percentage than this Dino Dino and Bowser level and carnival oh shit you're right those all have lava but okay this is gonna be a construction zone the lava is just gonna be there and you don't really walk on it this is this is supposed to be a construction zone and I just kind of needed the lava so that there's something where you don't want to fall in we know I can be part of the metal foundry for the construction what is a metal foundry oh now it's too much for that I think it's the game didn't last week I was outside with friends instead of being a fucking nerd like usual all right I'll give you a quick rundown of this so basically this is this is the idea for the visuals this is like a valley on top of a volcano there's gonna be a lot of lava here that you don't want to fall in there's gonna be a bunch of buildings here it's gonna be like a construction zone and that's basically it there's gonna be like some steel beams over here it's basically the idea is Rico Harbor but filled with lava instead of water when I make the lava green why not make the lava green why not make the lava green why would it be green there's a lot of this XFR yeah yeah now that Biobak mentions it I kind of see it the thing is lava is not an integral part of this level we can't just swap this out for water if we want to it could be oil too like I'm not picky here hello radius matey I definitely did not expect you it is funny case yes I'm glad you think I'm funny fresh cement there's gonna be a cement pit or a small factory like true okay see I just need this to be inside of a valley I think or I don't even need this to be inside of it I just need this to be a actually was to still be inside the desert but then I noticed that there's that kind of doesn't have any colors and that's kind of lame so you can have it on your screen like bloopers and Marica that would be lit on fire hmm we can definitely do oil but how would oil work so this just be like an oil rig we already have the missions I don't want to change them let's go see you do again the more construction will be it so there should be a village now that's too many polygons or too much overdraw rather and I'm changing this to an archaeology thing gonna miss you America is the loss of his first my child no no okay the theme is already there we're just thinking about the colors right now like the missions are decided the basic layout is decided right now we're thinking about how to make this look good what can we theme this after like where is this located so that we can make the colors look good a purple desert what the fuck what is a purple desert this is a real thing but this has the same colors as Cooper with Kov isn't that a bit lame to have two levels so close to one another with the same colors yeah okay exactly you have the same concern you know sometimes all this is rain reflection things yeah but not salt on the oil theming yet I mean oil kind of works because this is like the harbor you know so do we just make this like a sea of oil your plans for Yoshi coins um the Yoshi coins let me just get them for you the first is on top of the mission one scaffolds which is where you mess with all the bows are minions the second I haven't decided yet it's gonna serve you somewhere around mission two which is where the minions are striking that doesn't make any sense I think employment mission three no mission two nevermind then one is another pile of breakable blocks one is around both his office and one is in the sewers that you can enter here yeah I like that Biobak I think I'm doing that actually so what I'm gonna do instead of this is it's just gonna be like a valley surrounded by oil it's just gonna be like a metal rig surrounded by oil I just have to think about like how we frame it because if you're gonna go with the oil theme then I probably want like a whole sea of oil around this right water with oil spills on top is more interesting just straight like oh yeah but if there's water at the bottom then I don't want players to jump into the water you know yeah we can do that Jackson I'm low where Mars diagnosed with okay I mean not rusty bucket B no I don't like it the level is so ugly what's this map but this is a construction zone where bows as minions are working and basically you come in that you mess with everything seemingly endless cease we will have to fade it out in the far for distance but it can look really big on top and oil pouring in from the top so you can have some more things to do with oil pouring from the top our movie cement factory and I look at that I don't think I remember this area yeah that's lame can you do this cool effect for oil I probably can do something like it there so this is gonna be an oil rig on the sea then that kind of works for me that gives us some good color like something just for the background but a good amount of color although this color composition is kind of static all right I guess we're making it an oil rig although I had an excavation pit plant it doesn't really work on an oil rig we will need to replace that part what do you see I for this is the frantic fleet factory this is where they built the airships so building the actions right where the oil is kind of makes sense let's see where was the excavation pits hmm wait this is the mission one area can make it shallow oil that only has you move when you fall into it no I don't want you to walk around on it that is funny bio back but this is Bowser's construction zone so no Yoshi's around there are no beasts now I don't chosen coat you know if we go with this then the mission for building shouldn't just be an unfinished building it should be the power generator building no you're saying I don't say fucking enslaved look we we only want the players to see that during the boss levels yes please stop giving me random fucking ideas that are completely off topic I am NOT looking for that yeah but what if you made the way you could destroy parts of the airship being built never make these it was what nope okay so discard this part here we are going with an oil rig most likely that's actually kind of neat because this is the first level we are allowed to make that is actually just square the minion should go okay I like that I like that a lot that definitely should be in there so since we are planning on having there an area be above steel beams here we can do that this is gonna be the power generator area I like that this is all squared or a slate out so this is gonna be the part where it goes to boss's office I guess you can go underground into the sewers here what's the excavation pit for again for star five star five is all the red coins shit how did I oh they're right here above the whole scaffolds okay this is gonna be an extremely vertical area I think so now we can see could you add a small polygon or image of your design in the background from the side of how you could see a lot of tomorrow's sunshine we can but that might not look good we'll experiment with that there is a legit storyline going on but it's not a very deep story it's like a Mario story okay I just basically did something and then under that I'm just thinking about how all of this is gonna work out see if we have to generate a here then mission 5 is gonna be a bunch of like just steel bars and stuff above the floor mission 2 is gonna be still buzz around this area here actually I can be around this area here then mission 1 is gonna be in this area where you mess with everyone the middle has to be kind of a plaza there's a resource to put together the lost powers Hermanos and the mushroom kingdom I'm actually watching Breaking Bad with my wife right now and I'm liking it more than the first time around now that I'm actually paying attention all right let's find a good floor texture for this we can make this look kind of like wait since we're not going with the lava theme because that's a bit lame This is kind of what I'm thinking this should look like. I think this is a very cool looking level. Just download Project64 1.6, you don't need the new one. It's shit. Still working on the zoo level and I think it should be much less conservative of the saturation. This is Mario 64, the color should be vibrant. Ah, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right, I agree. I think the only reason the saturation in the zoo level is a bit bad is because I ended up doing manual shadows everywhere with like a blue tone over the orange, which didn't really kind of kill the saturation. Sonic 2 Oil Zone. I kind of like the purple. The purple-orange here is nice, yeah. What if we made like purple-orange and blue? Purple-orange-blue, purple-orange-blue. Let's do it. Let's try it. This could look so good. Oh, now I'm excited for this. See, that's always how it goes. You start making a level and you feel like, wow, this is dogshit, this is garbage, this is not working out at all. And then you get a few ideas and suddenly it's like, ah, shit, this is gonna be the best thing ever. So I want this to be a really deep, luscious blue. Search different areas of levels in a previous life? Do you still search? Nope. We have the basic outline now, and now we're thinking about how to make the art of the level.    Hard work in one of the greatest jobs, true. Try to make a color palette online? No, I tried that before. It sucks doing it online. This is not really the deep blue I was looking for. So blue, no more oil? No, no, no, I want there to be oil, but it's gonna be under the main area. And there's gonna be like some oil spill stuff around. Yes, I've already made 10 courses. Going to a concert? Okay, good luck. I have never been to a concert in my life. And this is closer to the deep blue I wanted. Many courses? Obviously 15. Oh, I'm making a new video. The video is called, this is really good clickbait, Mario64's movement is not perfect. Oh, that's such a YouTuber title, I am so proud of that one. I have 20 minutes of content already and it's not stretched out this time. It's not like the grass video at all. It is actually a good video. It's just 20 minutes of me shitting on Mario64's movement and talking about how great it was. So people don't get upset. Maybe I get to fuck shit up by throwing a bubble into the vast of oil. Oh no. Lucky I put many brain cells into like six words. Dude, being concise is one of the most important skills in the world. Being concise is one of the skills I value the most. The more concise you can be with your words, the more information you can put into a single sentence, the cooler it is. Usually what I do when I tweet, I type out the tweet just the way I think of it and then I shorten it more and more until it's just a few words. Where is my Metal Harbour reference? This is what the platforms look like, so this is kind of what I want. Oh, this looks cool too. Hello, Retromania. No, this is the platform I like the most. Let's try this. Just for now. This is not set in stone, obviously. There can be many different platforms around here. No, it's not Metal Harbour. We just use it as an art reference. Yes, I know what the words mean. It's funny. Intentionally not using the mic in front of you. I am using this one. I just sometimes don't get shot. Why? Is it wrong? Is my audio bad? Wait, am I using my mic? I hope I'm not using my camera's microphone. But you would be able to tell because it would sound like absolute shit. No, what is it? It sounds like it's coming from your earbuds. Okay, let me check something. Okay. So I pressed edit and then all of a sudden it just fucking crashed. Interesting. I did not click exit, I swear. Nope, it's saying it's using my Blue Yeti. So I'm definitely using the audio right in front of me. Are you okay? No, Mario, Luigi, I am dying. Okay, what is a catwalk? It's when a cat walks. Okay, I figured it wasn't that. Okay, how do I have so many textures and none of them I like? I think a path made out of metal grates, high in a room. Oh. A man-sized bridge, okay. Look, the only Valve games I played were Portal 1 and 2 and a bit of Half-Life 1 before I hated the game and quit. So I never really noticed. I mean, Portal 1 is, of course, full of those, right? So what's the conspiracy? What are you working on, Mario? I am making Mario. Okay.  It works well enough. Valve has conditioned a generation of gamers to put random catwalks in places that they shouldn't be, so it's tearing society apart. Why? Yeah, that seems like something a very sane person would say. Okay. Okay, in case SM64's grass is bad, Emanuele, look. That video was a banger.  I need to break our attack without the buffer here. Okay. Okay, that's actually pretty banger. Is Yoshi a car? What do you think? Do you think Yoshi is a car? I'll let you guess. Okay. Wasn't something to stand on, but not a full stage yet? Yes. That is correct. I did not start by making a full stage. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I don't think this is gonna look too good, but let's look at it in-game. He is in the void. I accidentally put Mario into the void. Okay. Oh, he landed. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Mamma mia! Miss me having children, we'll have to spin in the void. Okay.  Interesting crash. What?  Oh. Okay, so this is terrible. This is truly, truly terrible. I see what I did. I probably made the radius 65,000 at the diameter. Yep. Okay. This doesn't look good. Yep. Yes, the course isn't gonna look good at the beginning. That's just how life is. So obviously there's an issue with the background not rendering because it's so far away, but that's fine. That's like not our issue. So I'm still not sold on the colors here. I think the water should be more purple. Oh, the texture itself is nice. Wow. I don't think green would look good. Okay. This is making the level too dark. Shouldn't the water reflect in front of the sky? That's why water is blue after all. You want the water to be orange? I don't know. I'm kind of using this a little bit as a reference. Black water with orange highlights would look sick as hell. Okay, because Biomex said that I will try that. Black water with orange highlights. I guess we lair between 0 and orange. Let's try Biobak's idea. Let's try this one. This is Mario Sunshine's water texture actually. If this texture works, then we can do some cool shit. I guess it's too bright. Ah, there isn't enough black in this. Not enough black... Wait. Combine color here. Is that kind of what you were thinking? It looks like lava. Yeah, a little. We did all this to get away from lava just to make Deliveroo look like lava again. Yeah, green and orange don't look good together. Well, if we go with this texture, then we'd probably use this effect here. But instead of blue and white, it would be like black and orange. So making something like that. I don't think this is black. I think this is dark green. 4, 4, 4, okay, this is black for sure. That's brown in there, oh actually that's orange. This is black and orange. I guess the main difference here is that this part here is like a deep red. I don't know, this feels so dark again. The skybox literally cannot be bigger. If we want the skybox to be big, we will have to program the skybox in instead of modeling it. Which is something we have to do at the end. Can we turn those images into a text chat? No. It's a sunset themed level. Yeah, like literally we can't do anything about the skybox until the end. I actually have to increase the draw distance here just so it looks semi-okay. Let's try an oil water effect first, because I just had a sick idea. The infinite switch case. Like a rainbow reflection water, yes, yes, yes, kinda. I think this is gonna be a huge part of the visuals, so we should not skip on this. Like we need to do it now. Okay. This is for the bowser clouds, okay. We don't need to set the brightness here. This is still cool. We need to include, what is it? Wet dry world? Okay. Would you ever do a 20 plus video course on minor role making in development style? Someone pays me really well. For the new youtubers, when Kay says he has a sick idea, that means we're gonna be watching 45 minutes of VFX attempts. Yep. That's what it means. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 7 and 12. Okay. Let's just see how this turns out. Does that traditional weird Yoshi of the week? Since when do we have that tradition? Anyway, me? I like Kari and Togawa, but that's a conclusion I've come to. After lots of pondering. Oh shit, this is not what I wanted. Hehehe. Interesting. It's not all bad though. At 7 and 12. Cool. Okay, let's see if this is even what screwed it up. Oh wait, it's because... I didn't mark them as IAs here. Oh, and also didn't mark them as the same. Okay. Only 7. Okay. I guess that's a fast 64 improvement since the last time I did this. Well, this is definitely giving me the orange sparkles. But this looks more like a Sea of the Doomed than the Sea we want. Oh shit. But this is okay. This is okay. Everything's under control. I think I just need to render the other water. What does this produce? I should probably, you know, just for once leave a comment. Produces 64x64x8. Is there an i4 one? Water render i4, this is the one I wanted.  So we have this one here. This will be the i4. How do you say that text interpolation CPU won't work again? Damn multiplication table. I'm not making nostalgia points, Sanai. You got the wrong address. Okay. The theme for this level. It's basically like a construction zone on top of like an oil rig that Bowser's minions are running. It's a little complicated. It's not supposed to be green and orange. That's just a render bug. Don't worry about it. How does an oil patch look like with the weird rainbow refractions? This. Okay, we're getting somewhere. I know it doesn't look like it, but we're getting somewhere. Trust.  Is there no shade color offer here? Shit. I wanted one minus shade color alpha. One minus. Okay. How do I get one minus shade color alpha? I'm sure it's possible somewhere. What if I do? One multiplied by shade color alpha and then. One minus combined color multiplied by texture. So zero color plus texture one color. Wait. No, I wanted multiplied by shade color alpha. God damn it. I want the opposite of this. So this needs to be texture zero. Zero. And shade color alpha. Okay. Okay. Oh, wait, but now we can't fade it out at the edges. I just realized. Texture zero multiplied by shade color. There we go. This is it. This is how it works. And now we set the color. To zero. And this is combined color. And combined color will be texture zero multiplied by prim. And I want this to be less orange. I think. Yeah.  Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Did I export the level? I think I did. Make the opacity lower. Nope. If the opacity is lower, what do you want to render in the background? Nothing. Woohoo!  The oil is not rendering. And this needs to be way smaller in scale. Do we have black in the level? No. I think that looks cool. I'll just wait until it actually works.  Yeah, the idea is to make the rainbow effect dynamic. This is not the rainbow effect I wanted yet. No. It also puts the water way too high, doesn't it? It looks better. This is still not good. It's not going up and down like I want.  I think I just need more wave heights. This looks so psychedelic. Yeah. I wish I could use shade color here. So I wouldn't have to do this weird combiner. Oh well. Ha, no, yes, max action. Oh god, I got way worse. But I think you guys can start to see the idea I have. Yeah, I need to divide this by two and I need this to be way lower on average. The max should be like 128. Actually, it will be higher than that. Hmm.  Frictional should be a very fine form, yeah. It's not supposed to be like that. This is a bit difficult to work the math out. Okay, that's because I just... Plus wave height max divided by two. I don't think we need this anymore. So this will be up to 512. So it should divide by four, maybe even by six. Hello Liliana. Eh, not what I wanted. So the maximum that water should be is between 512 and minus 512. Dividing it by six will give us a value around 90. So it's never really gonna be zero, is it? That's not good. What if we just do this? This is just gonna lower the average by 128 and make a very fine film. Ah, there we go. That's more of a fine film. Yeah, I think the oil pensions are still too big. I don't like that part. We should make them smaller. Yeah, you can't see the repetition because the oil pensions are so big. I'm pretty sure. Well, that was not it. Oh, whoops. How did that even happen? Oh. Yeah, I got my brackets mixed up somewhere. What? Am I going insane? How is this not valid? Oh. Will more people be working on this, like, or no? Well, some other people work on this as well. Making music. Biobak helps with the level layouts. Or the level visuals. Chat is giving input. All right, I think this is closer to what I want. I could still make it even more fine, the film here. Because the effect is cool, but overstating an effect like that kind of makes it lose its charm. So the name of this I will decide it. Probably Frantic Fleet Factoring, but it's not Seven Stone. Because we still changed a lot about the style here. Okay, I think I like this now. I don't like this purple. I think this purple looks terrible. Yeah. Yeah, basically, this is going to be where Bowser builds all his airships. And this is especially funny, because this is course 11. And in the second Bowser level, which is the level right before this, you destroy his entire fleet, right? So now you go back to where the ships were actually built. I think the effect should never be 100% off, only go from 100% to 20%. Never 100% off? I mean, I can show you how that would look. I think that would be pretty terrible, but let's try it. I would mix some of the music. Of course, I'm fine with that. But there's like a 99% chance I will see the music's not good, right? You'd have to live with that. I can't even see that it's 5% on, but it is. The fuck? Will the ROM software make me a RetroPie winning game? No. Oh, oh, okay. I think Biobak was onto something. Okay. Also, I think it should be the size of the orange specks, because rainbow reflections are based on wave size. So you want it to be smaller. Making it smaller is not possible, unfortunately. Because in the way the specks are being rendered, it's decided by the position of the vertex it's being rendered in. And if we wanted to make them smaller, we would have to make the specks smaller.  We would have to increase the amount of vertices, and that would be too expensive to render. So that's not really an option. We could make the effect more subtle. Right, that's like the most we can do. 10k triangles in progress? That's 202! Oh.  Your thing, eh? I mean, I can show you what it would look like with another subdivision. But it's literally double the triangle count. It's just gonna make the specks smaller, though. Oh. Well, with strong enough macro codes, you can power through it, I guess. I'm gonna admit, that looks cool. Man, this actually looks so much better. Maybe we just go with this. Maybe we just power through it. Like, fuck it. It's another thing. This is Bowser's Fleet Factory. It's on an old oil rig. I think it should be rendered on the high points, though, not the low points. So, we want the opposite of this. Let's just try it. Yeah, this is not great. Why is it so high, though? Like, what? Let's experiment with this. Okay. Clown vomit water. Mmm, clown vomit water. Okay, let's get it closer. We're gonna find the right value. Don't worry, boys. We're so close.  Any time now. Oh, with the music in it, what does it sound like? Uh, evil, bowser, construction. Those are, like, the key words.    Okay. So, why 1.6? I guess, why not? Give me a counter-argument. Oh my god, why is it not fucking rendering the thing anymore? It went from rendering way too much to rendering nothing. I thought minus 470 was, like, a valuable number. But nope. Oh, there we go. Now it's too much again. Okay. Minus 70 was too much. Just don't make ice cream level. At least make a combo with candy, like chocolate gummy bear or something. Mmm, there's the Arctic Train level that is planned. It might have ice cream in it. Yeah. Man. This is... no, definitely not 40. Uh, 30. It has to be at least 35. Okay. Okay, yeah, you can see it come through at some points, but it's not enough. Okay. Can you move a button to increase the number instead of recompiling? Yes, I can. Great. But I don't really wanna program that. Okay, you know what? This works, I think. I asked him what was for the melody. It's cake, honka honka! Dangerous code like a virus? I don't think so. Yeah, I think this is the right amount of effect here. And I want to reduce this to 8. The lava bubbles. Yeah, Chris 6, Chris 7, 8, 9, something like that. I don't know. Cupercano, I guess. Okay, so I want the oil rig to practically kinda look like this. I guess it's a nice yellow and a nice orange here. I like Metal Harbor too, but I think we're too far away from that aesthetic. Maybe I should fade to black instead of orange. Like this? I mean, I can try it. Oh, that looks a bit too dark, I think. Maybe a darker orange. Like so. And this one, yeah, this one can be black. He asked what? I didn't see the question. Okay. Make it all orange-gray? What? Some decentrated orange? Nah. Hell yeah, this is nice, this is nice. I like this. It's just went to VPR. I feel like that's a reference of some kind, I'm not getting. In your video, SMR is too short. You failed to go into detail on the user-referenced games and electronics. Could have been 30 minutes longer. True. Next year. The music and the oil level. What do you want to know? You asked me what it should sound like? I want it to sound like an oil level, like underwater, like Bowser, like evil, like menacing, like goofy too. It's not gonna be a video on this level's graphics. It's nothing special. We just made up some bullshit and now it looks good. That's all graphics is, you just make up some bullshit and then it looks good. Someone banging on pipes?       True true But I might have to check my DMS because I might get picked up Tonight Yeah, so I absolutely fucking love the way this platform looks I Think that will be our next big challenge to make this platform look decent I Sound like a remake of Sonic oil zone in 3d For some inspiration Okay, this image is cool as fuck You Don't know about the color palette Hello Abdullah I Really like these color stone Funky bass that sounds like bubbles popping. Yeah. Yeah I Swear that was a sonic song. That sounds like what you're describing sonic rush machine number Hmm It's a plus construction side things are normally yellowish so they might blend in with the background America construction shit is always red Also, these here are orange and we can't just go with orange no one cares orange is fine. I Feel like it can't be a big platform like this it has to be many small platforms Or if it's a big platform there has to be a lot of shit going on like pipes and stuff like that This seems like it has to be a very high poly area We might have to rethink the way that the elements are in this level I might have to be multiple layers to this and sort of this Since good buses, but really like the branch of each I fight god damn it Here comes another 25 FPS. No, it'll be fine. I'm not using an SM 64 editor. I'm using blender Hmm So what if we made smaller levels, I don't know if you guys remember the SEC here That was another kind of like that That I made a longer time ago we could go with something like it Yeah multiplayer isn't gonna run that great that that's like a given It's not gonna be as bad as Donkey Kong racing though So we're good Yeah, so this level is kind of ugly very very ugly But I think we might have to go with something like that Fasana sleep my agent activated someone's talked shit about Diddy Kong racing here. Yes to agree They said multiplayer in this game is gonna like and I said it's not gonna be as bad as Diddy Kong racing No, I don't like the structure me me don't like it I Think having a big structure like this is shit. I Think it needs to be different This needs to be almost like like What's the word a plane ship ship carrier Yeah, so this is supposed to be where his airships live I Don't know what you're looking for. I don't know how to make music I can just give you the vibe and then I can tell you what's wrong or right about whatever you made The ship carrier is also one big platform Yeah, yeah I Was honestly gonna be I I wanted this to be a construction zone, okay I want this to be somewhere where both as minions work like a construction zone and The needs to be a bunch of like in progress stuff here and you need to be fucking with both as minions The guy's question has been answered three times It's the chat full of kids at the beginning yes, but they're they're slowly leaving We're not adding a giant slingshot One second I said little King that's embarrassing. Were you still allowed back in the house? I Yeah, we don't want Sonic music in here It's gonna see kids are leaving someone ask about the backroom sake just got ignored It's like an offshore oil drilling station refinery, yeah, and that's what we're going with right now Bunch of just bows are minions working on here The problem is I hate how this platform looks right today stream is dedicated to making sure that the level can look good That's always our first priority before we start making the level We decide something where platforming can be then we look how we can theme this in a way that looks good with nice colors But the rig itself here and just looks terrible So if we reframe this instead of see this was the original concept obviously this doesn't work like not even close Yes Yes, that could be really cool pipes here between areas, oh wait that could be the heck Okay, that could be the heck see we have the issue here that if we make this area like this there's gonna be a shit ton of geometry and There's like no way to visually make areas Transition into one another but if we have long pipes over here They'll reach into the background and you go into one and you come out on like another part of the oil rig that will work Brickle Harbor is an inspiration for this. That's already like my on my list. I want those steel beams I'm just thinking about how we can make this work without making it so many polygons. That's gonna like on the n64 Tree level two Yeah, yeah, this is it's a very similar situation to the tree level But like what else are we gonna do We Have all this content and we need Mario to somehow be able to access all of it without the game going to shit Lots are not good. I The tree level is It's three giant trees and you can go between the trees with flying ships, which is fine, you know doing that for one levels No issue Doing something similar for two levels. It gets kind of It starts being a pattern Yeah If We do this should there be four areas for different parts of the soil Rick I Think we need to restructure our level then and I think maybe we wanna Rethink the title and I think maybe we don't want this to be so themed after bozos minions I Was gonna make four of these areas, right Put one here one here one here one here and then each area has one pipe that goes to one neighboring area So that before areas in total No, they're not all themed after Bowser I Know David Christopher I Don't really care what I say to that that's none of our concern Just because they have a lot of poppin doesn't mean that we have an excuse to have a lot of poppin Man if they have four different oil rigs like this though, the strike thing doesn't really work anymore I Think that was a platform objects that fit this theme Generators ship just like metal platforms into the floor cranes I Know I'm just worried about how we can make this level look good Without going so over good on polygons that the game is just gonna like and for that We probably need to make distinct areas, right? That's that's a given. We need to make distinct areas The question is how to make these areas distinct Without doesn't turning bad And so what we could do we keep This general structure and Then we say there's like an underground area And there's one pipe that leads to balls us private thing So what we initially had we had like just to show you this we had this and There was gonna be an entrance right here. That would lead to Bowser's Office that was gonna be an unfinished building here, which I guess we can turn this into like Inside a power generator and there was a sewer area which we can be like under the water area Maybe there's could pop in and out of the water What kind of animation would we use for that We could make this level end up feeling a lot bigger than like the 32,000 coordinate limit If we wanted to program that and I can Banjo's Rusty Bucket Bay, but it looks hideous and it's very small and I don't like it It no, it's like a There's oil in it, but it's like a haven Yes, we can do that Frank that's going to be benji to a sized I Don't remember how big benji to me is Look you can't tell me rusty bucket Bay doesn't look hideous. I'll get it Okay, this looks good on the screenshot but like hey, I Don't know It's just kind of unpleasant to look at And so don't get it for ideas no none of these ideas work at all I Mean This isn't really like an oil rig though, is it? Industrialism isn't meant to be pretty so Do you think I'm trying to like? Send a message about society in this room. I can know I'm just trying to make a game that looks cool Yes, you are Holly in this game you are It's society Yeah, so if you rerent that until And this one has mission one where you troll the minions mission two where the minions striking Mission three where the buzzer sends the boss enemy to break the strike Mission four with the power generator this can be somewhere else this can be just like an area off to like fuck you land Mission five at the red coins works here and the 8-bit pipe in the underground, okay, so we have the main hall There's no excavation pit anymore Train tracks leading to area one. We have metal pipe leading to area two Definitely breakable boxes train tracks some metal pipe leading to area one Sewer entry. Nope. We don't want that here. And then we have to sue us and the sewers are not a thing this is The water area Maybe some parts are flooded question mark. I Think this works So instead of one big oil rig like this with many small platforms that you can individually stand on and one main platform that leads to the Bowser pipes And There's gonna be one plaza where the strike happens that's gonna be like around here And then after that that's where Was that a crazy tall tower in the water and there's animation of you taking a pipe that spirals around the building all the way to the top That would look really cool, but I want you to climb Bowser's tower yourself Let me look at peaches fury real quick Because I have the exact platform I wanted and peaches fury maybe I have the model for it actually Let me just make sure I don't show anything I'm not allowed to show because I can work Hmm What the fuck is peaches fury on my PC is it going I think it's gone Yeah, this is oh my god, they look ugly wait what what did I do here this is not how I remember these at all Oh Was I thinking of the Ricoh Harbour platforms? I was. I just figured it did not look very good. And those platforms specifically are kind of a pain in the ass, but it is what it is, so it does not bother me. SM64, Player 3 Yoshi, Player 4 Wario. So true. I love getting those messages, my favourites. Oh god, someone scaled this Takucha down before sending it to me. Oh my god, they completely Ricoh Harbour. The skybox in Peach's Fury is pretty cool. It's very cute. Mario Sunshine, A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Where is it? No way, it's on the S. Super Mario Sunshine. Can we imagine a game that's still being ugly and industrial? Explain. Pay for your WinRAR subscription? What? Is anyone paying for WinRAR right now? Anyone in chat? Which one of these is the metal construction one? This one? No. Which one is it? What? Oh, this one. Yes, this is what I wanted. I'll burn every WinRAR fail. Honestly, I wonder if really rich people, like imagine Bill Gates or Elon Musk, do you This text is weird. I'm sure it loops somewhere, right? It has to loop. There's no way they modelled or they drew all this like individually. And if they did, then fucking why? Why would you do that? Oh, I see. Let's cut it here. And horizontally, we can kind of like. Not there. Okay. I think this kind of works for the platforms. The epic emoji button. Dude, I love the emoji I am a blender god. Very, very fast. Me as a speedrunner. Oh, so this is what they do with the sides. Interesting. So wait, this was the idea. Hmm. I need to see some Rico Harbor gameplay. I mean, UVs are just math, right? So that's why I'm good at it. I have no special talent for like 3D modelling. I just have special talent for math. Okay, I saw some interesting ideas here. Like this, this type of platform looks cool. Let's give What about Odyssey though? I actually did play part of this in time. Yes. Usually when people ask me if I played a game, the answer is no, but that one, yes. I remember I was like 12 years old at a sleepover. And I wanted nothing to do with these fuckers. Okay, this texture is cool. I just need to scan it down a little. Oh, this is gonna look terrible in Photoshop. Okay, Odyssey does not have Brodian wards. No way. No, no, no, no. Brodian wards. The textures have to be way more repetitive. If you told me Pokemon Scarlet Violet has Brodian wards, I would agree. Odyssey though, come on. That is a bit too mean. You're doing Odyssey dirty. What the fuck? What the fuck? That doesn't feel like half. That feels like Come on. There we go. Cut to selection. Where are you? There we go. Eastman plus Photoshop is the best combo. Breath of the Wild has Brodian wards. What? No, I don't make new textures. I can't make new textures. The texture is called DK fence. Okay. That's not so bad. Might want to change the color, but the overall idea. What's the in game? First, we need to actually texture this and then we can look at it in game. I think SimpleFlips makes a few videos again. Yeah. He had to wait until the whole drama blew over, I guess. Very smart business move. This looks kind of cool. I guess this kind of works. Something about falling out with this axe. The game meme is how everyone makes the shader maps the same resolution as the detail texture. Yeah. Yeah. I can see how that's maybe a meme. Oh God, this looks awful. Well, I mean, that technically is a mental health break. Dude, my workplace gets some breakfast. They are so penetrant about mental health too. It's like you have to make sure that no one can notify you of anything while you're not working so that you have work-life balance. It's like, I don't want that. And you can actually just ask to take a mental health break. I feel so baby that work, which I guess it is. Four-day workweek moment. I mean, there are 35-hour workweeks, right? That's basically a four-day workweek. And we get holidays paid off. This month, I have like three holiday days that I just get paid time off. All right. I think I like this platform here. I didn't really threaten to heavily hint that they were going to fire me if I mentioned mental health. But I'm technically still self-employed, so I should not have any workers' rights at all. But for some reason, they still give me rights. Bad businessman. If that was me, you're not getting your mental health day. You're fucking working. Hell, your child was just born, but when can you come in on work? Well, I'm glad I'm not my own boss. I mean, I technically am, but you know what I mean. If it was you hiring children, I would. I don't know if you guys ever seen my LinkedIn profile, but I do shitpost a lot. And I do talk about how hiring children or how child labor is like the best business strategy. Because I mean, okay, look, child labor is the best business strategy. If you look at games like Fortnite, Minecraft, or Roblox, most of the content in that game is produced by child labor. And those are like the three most popular games of all time. The most successful games ever. All thrive on child labor. I'm just saying it's not a coincidence Honestly, if I could go back to being a child and I was given the choice to either work or go to school, I would pick work. Child labor is still better than going to school. Fortnite does not thrive on child labor. Have you ever played the creative mode? All child labor. Why can I not refer what the fuck did my thing break What's going on with case today nothing Okay, why did my thing break what I'm gonna just gonna restart blender that is so weird Okay, there's definitely not the biggest part of the game. It's the only part of the game I play Okay, but even if you don't take that one into account There's still two game modes that are just or two popular games that are just child labor Okay, they are actually just hiring children as contractors that is even worse than I thought holy shit Child labor This live stream is weird true. Oh That explains it All Right, let's check out if this is any better visually now, that's not what I wanted 16 tons and when they get another day older and deeper in depth what He's here we had blocked another no What's the dictionary definition of evil wait what hiring children contractor? Yeah. Yeah, I could see it I Said it before and I'll cling on to this forever But if you want to finish a March 64 major hack you need to be mentally ill You cannot do it if you are not mentally ill What kind of normal person would just make an entire hack like that for free Yeah, the meringue broke, but it's fixed now Like right here, that's what you mean I'm guessing it's not cut out my oh shit, it's not Yeah, that looks a lot yeah It does not look good and a lot of this is way oversized I Didn't loop house mirroring is bad. Okay, fine. Let's take a look at this That better I Didn't live on beans on cock you left on beans and Cody I Don't think he ever had the money for coke I Still live mostly on chicken and rice I I Need a metal border texture here, this looks weird without it And we just didn't put vertex colors yet, I'm not baking the lighting like before even start making the level that'd be a bit insane I think people do speedruns because they're perfectionist. I think you are crazy. That's not true. It's fun to do speedruns, I guess Did they end up making a pizza Zeina made a pizza? Yes And the pizza was good I Know in the blue path Okay. Oh, oh you mean in the texture? Yes. Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. I see what you mean Hmm yeah, that is a real issue I Something we definitely should think about You may just make sure I don't miss anything Because then I was saying we might eat over at the parents, but I have not gotten the message since so I I Don't know how much longer I can stream I Okay, what do we do about the lights in different directions I Let's actually Try something here. Let's try to make the level with this in mind from the beginning Shit which one is it? Am I fucking blind? There we go Hello Zeina, oh, this is not a lava level You need to stay tuned for a bit to get what this is I I'm gonna play the new Zelda. Yes Since when do I have a debug level? You made the cake nice Weren't you supposed to write the cards? Why do you make it I Do you like the idea of baked lights I Ain't saying I know you can see what we've been working on Instead of on a volcano. We just decided it's gonna be on an oil rig Oh those light beams are way too dark it's because this is blocking it so make sense Look at the cool oil effect here. I Can't Where is my thing here? Oh God my recording setup now is complete ass. So I hope it's fine This might look very very bad Increase the amount of speculators. I don't wanna I Think also do some trickery with nice to get the oil to portray a range of color highlights Isn't that exactly what we're doing? Or what do you mean by noise? I mean there are colorful highlights, right? What kind of difference are you looking for Oh God this audio might be awful guys. If this is too loud, let me know This has so much input like oh my god This is like barely playable Well, it's 60 FPS, all right, oh my god, what the fuck What is going on I Don't even know how to do this on purpose I mean, I'm glad to see that the oil specs render I Guess I'll run us just fine My controller has like a right drift, it's really weird Hello Cheryl It's not the way the effect is supposed to be did look at the FPS here Remember when you said this was 25 FPS later, remember? Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. No Oh Right when the game drops below 25 at 20 FPS right now, I have below 30 FPS The interpolation for it is wrong That's why it looked like that Okay, well Well, I guess some of this is 25 FPS but I bet that's just because of the bark Oh God, what the fuck Okay, something's really wrong in the game right now don't worry about it though, we'll figure this out we'll figure it out I Think this is a more appropriate size here Nice braver frame rate I'm pretty sure it's just the back This seems like a decent size for like a generic platform, although my sunshine it's a lot smaller So I think I want to use smaller. I Anymore as a platform Damn you are a noob you didn't finish lost impact. I don't know So Zayn I am I gonna be over today or not, what is it I never got the message Okay This works, I just need to pull these down and give it the proper texture When I need time 5.30 or 6 okay okay what kind of voice is this going to be? so this is going to be where bowser's fleet resides you enter this after you beat the second bowser level where you destroy bowser's fleet this is on top of an oil rig and like bowser's minions work here and they all obviously love bowser but not their job I think this looks fairly good yeah I like it okay now we need to decide which color do we actually go with the blue or the red I still haven't really decided on the colors for this level let me let me look at this one more time in game so we can make a better informed decision about the colors people saying red I'm still kind of thinking maybe purple is to play  what if I went with purple red and yellow that looks bad I know why wrong layer there we go yeah half of the speculars are green it's just a rainbow texture like it's just a random rainbow blob you see you don't really see the red blob because it's like red zones from starbucks 64 I don't get it I should definitely be warmer colors yeah I can't see an argument for warmer colors but I just really really like this here  which is purple and yellow  let's try purple and yellow see if that works out so I hate camp  let me do this in photoshop I can't do this in game I have a pretty cool idea if this works then you guys will love this so so I want the white parts to be turned yellow and the blue parts to be turned purple I'm just thinking of the best way to do that I'm sure there's some color math I can do here so so all right that's not yellow enough oh god this is terrible this is terrible wait this is a 32x32 this is a 64x64 what what the fuck okay but how do i make the white yellow so so surely there's some photoshop trick i can do mask and addition layer i don't think so i mean this already looks better to me than the blue yeah it's a bit difficult to tell what this level looks like from the blender view because the floor is so different in game i think purple looks better too but it's time to add the yellow to this so disgusting so  i'm just trying to get a nice purple where the white would be a nice yellow where the white would be multiply blend multiply blend doesn't really work because it also multiplies the purple areas i want it so that the more white it is the more yellow it becomes so oh god all right so this kind of works but it's not great just draw pixel by pixel you want me to it wouldn't be consistent all over the place because i'm not going to do it perfectly right away yeah it's not terrible i guess of course so there's something more on the orange side i don't want it to blend into the floor of course the other one is the skin issue i was hoping that when i just changed the colors mathematically like that this wouldn't happen but it did oh well yeah we're losing a lot of colors on these images here which kind of sucks and this is the first 64 but that is very annoying that it defaults to rgba when it shouldn't well this is level 4 maru 64 remake oh this looks kind of royal of course the texture should be mirrored but other than that i think this has a lot more charm than this one here a lot more personality a black line pattern on the yellow part not sure what kind of pattern is called i'm not sure what you mean oh a nice trim would look i really like the yellow oh you want the stripes to be black instead of yellow basically  let me see nova's image first and then i'll make the decision whatever blue from bowser platform you fight them on to go with the other black stripes from boss battle arena you don't fight bowser here okay i'm not even really sure what you guys mean by stripes yet it's both from a distance the one on the right is like way easier to see and read i much prefer it now i think this other platform here the red one is kind of stinky i think i don't want to make the whole level purple and yellow bowser does not follow usher rules he has a theme park too and there's a very funny sign about the usher rules on there like it has a tape oh no no no that would be bad you guys mean something like sonic adventure here this this stuff is now i don't want those they can be around somewhere in the level but not on this platform now they can be somewhere else just not here these are supposed to be generic platforms that are like all over the level anyway it is almost five o'clock here i gotta get ready to go out and get dinner with zaina and her family i'm liking where this level is going we just have to make a few more adjustments and we're gonna get somewhere i will see you guys in the next stream until then bye bye
