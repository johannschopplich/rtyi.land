Hello Paul. Yeah. Hello, Louie. Japanese man. In Mario 64, there's not a secret room. There's the secret castle roof, technically. Yeah. Business day job. Is it a business day for you, Lila? It sucks to be human. You didn't speak at the day. Hi, kids. Today I will explain to you how to build a bomb. Especially for you, Lila. You didn't hear anything. I was just greeting your family, Lila. Bye, bye. Bye, bye. Hello, hunts. Do you guys remember that Swankybox video about the secret 121st star? God, if only I could make content like that. It's time to extend a change for you. I think time changes for me soon as well. Hello, soybean. What's up? You added that HD cam box? I did. Is this live? Yes. I'm fine with that. Everyone's on YouTube. You're all alone on Twitch. What's going on? It's almost nine hours long? What? Wait, there's like a hundred songs in here. I had no idea. Oh, it's a lot of variations. Never mind. Let me say bad words. Only if the bad wants any group that you are part of. You can do whatever you want, Reggie. It is programming. You're free. How do you find out your mental age? I would probably get like 14 or 15. I did like, what's my mental age test? I do a test. What are you going to do to me?  You're actually faced with a big decision. Okay. Three and four are the same thing. I think it's more like four. If I like candy, I'm a baby. I don't know what horse tomorrow is. You could probably tell me. But definitely can your ice cream. David, unless you go. I definitely search. Okay. Budgeting is for poor people. I'm sorry to say it, but budgeting is really for poor people. You can't measure someone's mental age based on that. I'm not even rich. Okay. Think about this. If you have to budget, you definitely have a spending problem. Right? Like in order to be in a position where you have to budget, you have to be making barely more money than you spent. So it's like, why are you spending that much? Surely not. Everyone who has to budget is on the verge of starving from not having enough money, like just spend less. Posting personal goals or interest engaging playful creative activities. While my personal interests are creative activities. This. Oh God. I'm going to be 17 years old. I guess this. I definitely don't create seek expert advice. It's going to be so disappointed. I'm going to be either dude. I'm going to be either like five or 50. There's no other way. It's none of these, huh? I guess quick breakfast is the closest. I usually work before breakfast because they don't need stronger to get out of bed. So Zeina takes so long out of bed that after we get up, I go down and I start working and then we eat because she's out of bed now. These all sound awful. I guess I'll take the fun. These are all awful. I guess I'm playing video games. Working on a hobby for sure. Well, not one for compromises. I'd rather just work towards a resolution. Get a new plan. None of these are all awful. I guess this is the closest. What's working? I guess this one. I'm 54 years. You're too acoustic for this, Mr. Emmanuel. I would have been 90, but I like ice cream too bad. Like see you at this great. I want to make this a little bit easier or rather make the matches still more. Doing this right now kind of sucks and I don't like it. Then you got the locked in 24 seven hours when I get the starting next episode of the TV show is stressing me out. So. Where is the cardboard? The gameplay new jump strat. Oh, what is it? How does it work? I didn't export the level. The fuck. But every time I say, say, am I going to clarify? I'm neurotypical. Really? I don't think you are. Not the vibes I'm getting. What the fuck? You see, I'm going to see in a long jump to force a front flip. Oh, that's fucking cool. I like this. It's because when you press out. It's like. He stops like that, right? That's kind of cool. Honestly, we should give it. Yeah. I'm always getting the shit. No, I know why it happens. It's because I made it. So if you're breaking and holding forward, you get a forward flip like this. Because of. I wanted to make the side flips more consistent. So I don't even need to press out. I can do it by just tapping forward, which is interesting. So I'm thinking we're going to have a bunch of colored platforms like this. And this is going to be the abyss. Oh. I did not fix this back. Just you know, there's no robot yet. Let's think about the texture for the floor. Today is a texture picking stream. Are y'all looking forward to it? I know Leela loves those. Hello John John. It will. I actually had an idea for the hot on N64. You had on emulator today. So a lot of people were complaining that that part looks too crusty on emulator. What if on emulator? We use the exact same texture, but make the hat half the size. Ever thought about that? How would it look? You have to see to judge. Yeah, this is perfect. Anyway, let's do this. Let's go. Is this work? He said you're 40. Yeah, makes sense. No, I was just saying, what if the hat was just half the size on emulator to make it look more crisp. But it looks too tiny. It looks stupid. Actually, it kind of looks cool, but it also looks stupid. Well, this would only be on emulator. Right, I programmed it so that on emulator it shows like this and on N64 it shows like this on N64. This is only for emulator. Like totally left through the screen somehow. Because I'm not adding options for every little baby thing. Less options is better, don't you ask me. I think it looks like shit by the way, so I'm not adding this. Trying to rigify rig to work. So I intuitively go modify bonzer to make my own sim rig and it works way better. Nice. I have to mention for the old bugs this ain't true. We need options. Can I get an option for... There's a pixel on the Goomba's eyelids that I don't like. Can I get an option for that please? How come I get a million errors every time I do anything here, Lina? You see that? I'm getting so many errors on first N64 I'm just ignoring them at this point. Like what is this? These occlusion planes? Don't know what that means. Oh, it's our fault? Gotcha. If it's Sauron's fault then I won't even mention them. Because pointing out Sauron's fault feels mean. If it was Lina's fault I would point it out because it would be funny. Is this going to be an option for cinematic 24fps? I'm so used to playing Mario 64 with full framerates. Lina, you have pointed out so many of these that your remap looks kind of messy. I am allowed to do it back to you, alright? Just because I'm the streamer doesn't mean I have to be the butt of the joke every single time. Alright? This time you're the butt. Nothing you can do about it because I have the microphone. And when you're arguing the person with the microphone always wins. You are the butt. Objectify. I'm not objectifying you. I did not disable prim color. Cool. Have you guys ever watched the TV show I Think You Should Leave? It is the funniest show ever. It is hilarious, dude. I'm getting underflow. Eww, nasty. I wonder if this underflow is real or a bug in the emulator. Because I have no idea. I feel like this is a bug in the emulator. Actually, maybe it's not. Over clamping. Oh, they're supposed to be cardboard. This is going to be the secret room you find in level. And I think I want this to be lava. And then the cardboards are just going to fall into the lava while you platform across this. Mama, mama. Thank you for this banger, GrandCircrop. A non-beaking solar volcano. I mean... That could work. I had not planned a sequel to Doki Doki Mario 64, to be honest. Wait, that's the wrong one. 1, 2, 9, 2. Fuck. 9, 7, 0. Is this the level entrance? I know exactly what you mean, but... I don't think I want random stuff like that lying around. I do want it to be crud materials. Oh, you mean in the overworld. Doki Doki Banjo-Kazooie would be way more fitting than Doki Doki Mario 64. I have a week of work, and I don't have work hours. I just have hours to work. Leela, you don't have a job. Come on. I was thinking of playing the Banjo-Kazooie games, or Banjo-Kazooie game, on NSO. But then I decided that I don't want to deal with the game. The updates have been terrible.   Oh, right, I set the B Berms too high. That's going to fix the overflow. OK, so I can't think of a good way to fix the overflow. I don't understand. Nice, Maui. Give me recently, I don't understand. What's the idea here? So the idea is I have these two platform designs and I can place these platforms as I want around the level. And there's going to be saws between the platforms. And when you get close enough to a saw, the saw starts going. So you do have to constantly move pretty fast to not die in this level. And eventually there will be a star somewhere. So really, this is all just platforming on floating platforms. That was my concept for this. I think it's easier to just do this. Then I'm going to scale the object and place them without guessing. Oh, no, no, no, no. That's not what's going on. I have B Berms on the actor and I can change to B Berms to change the scale of the platforms. I did that to allow for more variety here. And I set the platform scales to 1.2 instead of 1. So I couldn't do that so easily. It's not really an autoscroller. It's more like a race. And I should move the warp to the sub area. What the hell? Did I not export the level? I did not. Let's move the warp to the sub area. Right, so I measured them out before and now they will perfectly fit. I guess there's one coordinate of rounding error. And now they can also take all random colors without overflow. So this is the plan. Although maybe it is easier to additionally have them in here. And I do want them to be like connected here. And then I'm thinking the next one will be like the walking section. Okay, and this is significantly faster. And then I can set this B Berm here on the empty to be... If I set this one to F, then it will scale up by 10. By 2. Like so. But I think I only want this on one axis. Domino? I don't know what that is. Do you mean like the domino blocks? I've definitely played with those as a kid at some point. I'm not sure if I'm sold on the random colors yet. I'm not actually sure how the domino game works. Is this the one where you have like blocks with numbers on it and you have to match the numbers to like attach them? The scaling didn't affect the UVs. Yes. I mean, yeah, it is programmable, but oh my god, do I have to? Alright, well, this is also a pretty good idea. Okay. I can place invisible walls, but not a programming function for that now. I think we should also start thinking about the real world. Do we want this to just... Actually, I do kind of want it to be just in a black and white. This is like an arbitrary place. But I do need to think about something for the floor, because obviously what we have right now is awful. And I do like the idea that it's all just painted, but painted is probably going to also look kind of bad because of all the repetitions. Yeah, I hit the wrong axis here. Now I have to of course program all the physics myself. Nah. Horizontal wallkicks like this are already pretty difficult, honestly. But it's 15x15. The stretching is very off. Can't do it. And of course it's possible to dynamically generate the vertices and have the UV scale the actual model. That might actually be what I have to do then. Yeah, I want the plane to always be slightly behind the source. So you're saying multiple smaller platforms instead of one big one Yeah, I guess these two here could be just together like two small ones each Hello Arthur, hi All right, we can do that and then we can make the scaling less of a factor maybe like so So these two platforms would still be the same and then I need to delete all of this basically Please be a better person To add one of your mods twice I have no idea Hotel Well, that's breaking the self-arm rule Band of Tim simpleflips discord I'm sending him the screenshots It's a wonderful offense Ordnungswidrigkeit for sure Have you guys seen the meme where it's like pigments carry him back to the onion That one's kind of peak I'm thinking for Halloween I'm gonna dress my baby up as a Pikmin And then I'm gonna throw her and have her carry my things She does have Mario 64 Mario proportions But how do you dress someone up like that? You put like a beard on her big knobby nose Give her the cap That would be very funny to put a beard on her We've seen the video when there's the kids and he's like tapping a superstar glued to the wall And then he thinks the Mario Starman theme and runs into a wall Where his beard is like right below his nose How is that not a beard, huh? Okay, question, do we have to solve just go along here and then this falls down Like, do we just not care? Let's call the mustache I must ask you to leave me alone What kind of fucked up transformation that I just have open in blender Is that sideburns? I don't like having hair at all I wish I could just not have hair Huge sideburns with no beards Why are they called mutton chops? That sounds like an offensive word somehow The game with that ad called car and would you make a mod related to it? I have never heard of it And I also don't know the DK64 song covers, unfortunately That does sound like a cool thing, though Let me just make sure that these are actually all working What are your opinions on this Donald Trump guy? I haven't heard much about him He's the guy that got shot in the ear and then shot again somewhere Wait, he's the guy from the Instagram reels that always talks to Obama, right? About like video games And they make tea lists together Man, these are so far apart that it's hard to climb Plays Minecraft with Obama and Biden Yeah, I've heard of him I'm actually hyped for the presidential election I might actually watch that live Let me put you on real quick The DK64 covers Oh, I see, it's just a sound font I don't care about Celeste, so I won't get the reference I'm guessing those are a lot more pleasurable if you understand what they're talking about Malwarebytes? Spooky sales, 45% off Nope, not buying it See, I have a strategy with Malwarebytes I always have it installed And then I never pay for it unless it's like 100% off and then I activate it for a little bit Wait, that was a song request? Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, if it was a song request, I'll listen to it I thought you just wanted to show me the song I didn't see that was a song request Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories is a banger Gamers always say Dark Souls is such a hard video game, Dark Souls is so difficult and unfair Play Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories, you little bitch And then tell me what game is hard and unfair I've beaten Forbidden Memories, alright? No cheating, no save states, just raw playing the game That's difficult, fuck you Dark Souls There's a lot of black in here Are the conveyors of a bug at work? Should they be actors? I think they are actors, but their visuals are part of the level geometry So there's an actor that's like, if you're in this radius and you're in this collision type, then just push Mario back So they shouldn't be actors in the level model This definitely sounds like Celeste You know what I really wanna play? I wanna play UFO 50, and then I wanna play House Party in UFO 50 But there's no way I'm paying for a video game Do the bombs on them actually follow the faces, or do they have to re-create a path? I want to make them take a turn, but I don't know if that will work Let me check, which level did we import the bomb cap into? It looks like it's this one here That's for the fight Bunch of war gears, bomb troops, that sounds about right What the hell? Is there only one bomb producer? YouTube autoplay Okay, so they're just moving forward on the treadmill by a mic If you want the treadmill to take a turn, I can do that, no problem Oh, but wouldn't they move here and be stuck on this edge here? That would look bad too You'd have to make this lower so that they drop onto it and then it goes this way Or, you know, make this a rounded corner If you make this a rounded corner, yeah, we can do that I have definitely paid for video games before, but I don't like doing it Then you'll have to make the drop-down thing so that they actually end up in the middle Yeah, I would like to do an open-world Mario 64 at some point But whether I'll have time to do that is a completely separate issue Probably not I saw some Mario 4, it's like a cardboard art craft level Huh? How do you exactly turn the rounds? It looks kind of nice though Would be technically interesting Wait, what are you talking about, Pants? I missed a message from you, Pants Or maybe YouTube ain't or Twitch ain't But there's a message missing, I don't know what you're talking about Oh, open-world Mario 64, right No, I think I can make an open-world Mario 64 interesting game design-wise If you think about it, like Tears of the Kingdom, people like that one Mario 64 has even more tools to make things fun This song is 47.11 from Engine 3, full OST, on Anthony2112's channel Yes, the Chorus 1 demo is still planned I'm probably also gonna just randomly throw in Delfino Plaza on the N64 into the demo So you can play Delfino Plaza on the N64 If you unlock it, I'm gonna hide that really well in the demo Yeah Bowser's Furry would be an easy way to do open world and have it be fun I guess. Although I'm not a big fan of Bowser's Furry either. Or if you have played the Mystic Stars that's like a fun open world R6 Superhack. Although it's not loadless, right, so it's eh. Same old or exciting again? Has it ever stopped being exciting? Um, there was one thing I wanted to do and I don't remember what it was, cool. Do we want a slidey section? Right, yes, I wanted to look at the floor. I can't stand this floor existing anymore. Can't do it any longer. It looks kind of bad. But it looks a little more painted at least. Speedruns of this game are going to be crazy. This game has insane speedrunning potential. What other interesting thing can we do here? Like a triangle jump maybe? I could see that working out. Yeah, how do invisible walls contribute to speedruns being fun? And BLJs too. Most of the time BLJs in speedruns aren't that fun. It's like if there's one or two BLJs in a speedrun, that's pretty hype. If there's 20 BLJs in a speedrun, it no longer is hype. As soon as the game becomes unrecognizable from how the casual gameplay of the game goes, then the speedrun is not fun anymore. If you've ever looked at a Sonic game speedrun, you know exactly what I mean. Sonic games are just so broken that they're not fun anymore. A speedrun. I want to make sure this looks right. Have you ever seen me on the stream not working on Return to Yoshi's Island? Be honest. Lila? What is going on? I'm just getting a red triangle. Beating this game in under one hour is going to be very difficult. This looks to be the error. I think realistically, once this game is done, any% speedruns, if there's no major skips, are probably going to be around 80-85 minutes. And 100 runs are probably more like 3 hours, 3 and a half hours. Just throwing out a random gas. Yeah, this is fun. Although I only am able to do that because I know what's going to come here. This part is probably going to be really difficult for a lot of people. Actually, there's this move, so maybe not. I will never switch to barrel launcher, no matter how many people bark me about it. You want to see how well parallel launcher does? Oh, updates? I pressed A on this controller, so now I'm supposed to be able to control this game with this controller, but the game doesn't even boot. But then if I switch to Moopin with Glide, then the game does actually boot. I think. Yeah, but I can't control the game still. Also, the graphic plugin they bundle it with can't render my coins. Wait, so I'm the only setup with parallel launcher that works that can't render the coins? Dude, this is so shit. What a garbage ass I'm going to play. And everyone's telling me to use this, and it's just... I hate it. It's not actually garbage, there's just some quirks in it. And I don't know what's going on, man. It sucks. What do you mean you agree that parallel has bugs? I just showed you that it has bugs live on stream. This is not a matter of you agreeing or disagreeing. As soon as you start agreeing or disagreeing over facts, I'm getting politics vibes. What's this level for? The game I'm making. I can't... I can't scale it. That was weird. I don't know why that option keeps turning on. That's... weird. I didn't say that. Okay, but that's where it goes wrong. Yeah, that's the Arts and Crafts stage. This is a little bit of an arbitrary sub area compared to the entire rest of this game. This area stands out against the entire rest of this game, I think. But I don't know if it's good or bad, but oh well. It's a girl, Rose, on her Twitch account. Hello, Rose. Okay, I changed the wrong beeper. Other than that, I like it. I need to think of more creative jumps here. Song requests? Okay, thank you for letting me know. Oh, that's nice. Dude, Forbidden Memory is so insane. They made like 600 3D models for every monster for a feature no one uses, because the feature is annoying as fuck and optional. But they made so many 3D models. The entire game's, like, at least 90% of the game's budget must have gone into the 3D models. And no one uses them. It's true, the stress of the source exists, and it will be fun regardless. But if I can think of a creative thing on top of that, I suppose. Oh shit, we got a Biobak fan in chat. DONG, DONG. They added DONG to the song. I have an idea. I don't always do that, just most of the time. No, I'm kidding. I would never. I would never do that. As soon as Most Critical talks about me, I just give up. Let me see if this actually works. No, I'm not gonna do that scream. People didn't even really watch the BLJ video. The BLJ video was half, like, an attempt to see if people are interested in this stuff. And apparently they're not. I might try to make a video, like, about the mirror. I think that could be interesting. But really, I'm just testing out what content works and what doesn't on YouTube. On the YouTubes. This went awfully wrong. I think I changed the wrong variable.  The BLJ video, that's good. But I need views. Look, there's two things I care about in life right now. Professionally. The first is making my video game and the second is making money. Making YouTube videos, for me, that's just a way to make money. I have very little passion for creating those. So if a YouTube video of mine doesn't do well, that's like... Alright, well, that sucks. Even if I liked the video and others liked it, it still didn't do what it's supposed to do. Does that make sense? Okay, well, I did not change the correct variable then. I It's just important to me that's like it's understood my passion is not making YouTube videos it is making the video Yeah, it makes sense blend I do like talking about those And there's definitely there is one I want to make about all the new optimizations I found I think that will be very interesting Oh, what happened to the scale 1.562 that's absolutely not the scale I wanted This is 5a 1.262 0.5 I Say accidentally squared with scaling before makes sense though I Also want to make a video about the missing actually, you know what the one video I'm looking forward to making the most It's the mr. Beast video for April fools next year That will be so funny Who Too big The diagonal fine plates are fine Yes, there's probably gonna be one or two coordinates where you can't Way you have no floor, but should you ever touch those coordinates the wall down there? It's just gonna push you onto the coordinate So it's it's not actually gonna be a problem No, let me guy making an object so they can move If They can move then we have a lot of options here making them objects is actually a lot more expensive Okay, how come it's not scale 1.25 I Very clearly looks like scale 1.25 to me here The hell Something wrong here How is this one at scale 1.25 the exact same as this one at scale 1 Except it's offset something went extremely wrong here I don't know how I did it, but I really messed this up somehow Looks like somewhere just a bloody scale once and the translation. Hello Clemen First you can make spinning objects on our 64 And program whatever you want you can program a Giant car that eats hazelnuts Cake New level, um, this is a sub area in the cardboard level I Don't understand Well, at least those platforms are right now Nutella yay or nay I do like Nutella Okay, you know what I'm just gonna remake these platforms just clean it just didn't work Yeah, it's almost like the blender father telling me exactly what I'm working on Right, you're allergic When you're allergic, but you know, you don't like it So did you just like risk your life to try it because the other kids are talking about how great it is I Like objects waiting on the exit when we're glitching out and I was waiting in the photographs on the OG game There is the bowser elevator that one rotates horizontally But You're right that horizontal rotation like that is a little bit of our 64 because sometimes it's not even possible to rotate along some axis Due to the way the rotation orders are applied But other than that, there's no bark with it Dude how is this so fucked there's clearly a large difference Between how all of this is applied in blender versus in Mario 64 That is so weird We did this exactly I think this might just be too much people often. We can't do this And You can't eat Nutella because there's too many stimulants in it, that's funny How about in big staircase No, nine seven zero Fuck it. Let's see how this place Oh Oh, yeah, do you guys think it would be a fun video to make It would just be titled Not a single staircase in Mario 64 works correctly, and I'm just talking about why not a single staircase in Mario 64 works correctly Oh Yeah, this is actually really nice I like this a lot especially with the colors here the colors fit very well Yeah It's me what's how it's course 14 Mr. Beat arc Didn't I catch you talking about how the game is too easy before? What's all this too many was like this is a baby easy. I can do this with my eyes closed right I did it with my eyes closed. You can't say it's too many walking so if I can do it with my eyes closed I Don't think it's annoying I Could be a roofed section here somehow  May I please ask a question You just did You just asked me a question without permission, oh my god, how could you You Okay, how do we make harder platforming With just these two types of platforms that fall down once you get close we can make them time a tighter I Did it once three or four years ago still comes up this jet Asking a question without permission There's a lot of people that go like can I ask a question and it's like you're you did ask a question Why do you ask that? I don't understand We did the guy just give up you can ask a question Don't answer said time you want us about the expert because I haven't written again We like which emulator do you recommend now that is safe to use? So every emulator The exploits to get hacked you need a ROM that actually has the virus in it, right? So you don't emulator with the invulnerability and the ROM that is specifically programmed to exploit the vulnerability You randomly getting a ROM like that is incredibly rare especially if you just don't look like Mario 64 Right if you go on Romaking.com and you download like a hack with two downloads made by someone who really knows what they're doing Then you might be in trouble, but it's very unlikely. Anything's gonna happen to you And if you go with a parallel launcher nowadays or the new version of project 64, you're probably fine Like it's very unlikely anything's gonna happen. In fact, I don't think there's a single person Right now that anything has happened to except for simple flips Because he plays hex before anyone else does That is absolutely unhinged behavior claimant Yeah, project 64 had had some dodgy installers before Sister pizza song. What is this? What's house? That's the pizza song Well Surely if someone wants to make a virus, they're also gonna make the hash fit. So that's that's not really a Safe way to get around it in my opinion I Will launch that that's a pretty safe emulator. It's being actively maintained by someone who is known in the community I Need insane amounts of computing power to make two facets to smash really Can't you like reverse engineer how the ash is computed I Know that for most n64 games is a simple checksum. So you increase one byte by one and then decrease another by one and you're good Surely you can do something like that with an Or is md5 hash a lot more complicated than that I Guess there is functions where computing the inverse of the function would be a lot harder than computing it for what? fair enough Oh Yeah, if you're only planning to play like a bunch of popular remix then nothing's gonna happen to you I fear that they won't be touched. I have no idea what that looks like, but don't they have like 15,000 polygon models? It's not gonna run fine. I can probably get a Mario model that looks exactly like the Render96 model to run fine in vanilla levels on my engine. I think that's doable. Yeah, it makes sense, Boris, I get the concept. Yes, Shrippy, we make N64 games here. What if it's the same bytes but in a different order, do you get the same value out? Probably not. Actually, no, you would want that to not be the case. And it would be difficult to make that be the case, so that's for sure not the case. Why are they so off-center? Shinzo! You know how 3D Marios have an easier output angle and you are allowed a bigger variety of input angles and you get the wild side? So yeah, it is a lot more difficult here. But most likely what happens is you respawn at the beginning of the area anyway. And by the time you reach Chris-15, I'm sure you guys have gotten a lot better at Mario 64 movement. There is also the fact that if you want you can just do this. Which might be easier, depending on who you ask. How many continents is this off? 1, 2, 9, 2. 1, 2, 9, 2. Okay. I think this will be fine. You can recount that we are actually falling by the time Mario gets to the end of them.  Okay, but this is extremely difficult here. Maybe if they were less far apart this would be easier. But I don't think I want to put this on the player. So let's make this a little bit skinnier here. Like so. Okay. That was like what Tears of the Kingdom was going for, right? In Tears of the Kingdom, what I heard is they wanted to make the play-up feel like they were tricking the system. But in Tears of the Kingdom they didn't go so far into that. That I always just felt like every puzzle is way too easily cheesable with the same strategy over and over. So there wasn't really much of a puzzle at all anymore. Okay. Yeah, this is easy enough now. I am liking this. If Monkey Ball is allowed to do it, I'm allowed to. Okay. Dude, this would be an insane hot take for Twitter. When I played Tears of the Kingdom I felt like it was mentally abusive towards me. And I will not elaborate on this. You just have to sit with that. Okay. I lost the plus FPS abusive. I don't understand. Explain. Come to think of it, what speedrunners are probably going to do is something like this. Realistically. Well, okay, in Tears of the Kingdom people are saying that Tears of the Kingdom is quicker and better than Breath of the Wild. And I see why. There's a lot more content to it. And it's a lot more geared towards giving you tools to solve problems with. The problem I have with Tears of the Kingdom is that the problems you're solving, they always work with the same solution. You look at it and you see, okay, this is what the intended solution is. But I have these 15 other solutions that I could be using. And through having a few solutions that are so overpowered that it obsoletes the other solutions, that kind of ruined that point for me. In Breath of the Wild, whenever you got to one of the shrines, every shrine felt like it gave you a new insight in some way into your toolkit. And I didn't have that feeling in Tears of the Kingdom at all. Just because the tools I already have were just capable of solving every problem I would run into. There's something wrong with the FPS. I did not notice that. I had no FPS issues as far as I remember. Yeah, they're a very different style of game. If you're just in Zelda for like the 8 dungeons and whatever, then there's no point in you playing that game. I still thought Breath of the Wild was really fun though. Ranking them compared to other 3D Zelda? They're completely different types of games. That's like... That's entirely objective, right? For me though, I think Majora's Mask, Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess will be like the peak. I think we have enough stage here to just put the star here and no one will complain. I think the final star should be on a stable platform though, one that doesn't fall. Yeah, that's kind of the point. Same with Majora's Mask, right? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, you want the floor to scroll. The floor is painted, at least that's the idea. It obviously looks like shit right now, so I have to make up a solution for that issue. But that separates. I'm gonna platform through this once to make sure I like the platforming. And then after that, we have to add the sauce. And the sauce will make the level fall. That bird with the human head? Where is that? I don't remember a bird with a human head. Oh, Tante Uku. I thought you famously couldn't complete your own levels. Wait, who said that? I'm really good at Mario 64. You might be thinking of Brodude. Okay, this section is too difficult. You see those speedkicks? Those frontflips? Is this the movement of a noob? Alright, I like it. That's brutal. What? That's crazy. You see how I can speedkick, man? There, two speedkicks in a row. I'm guilted at this game. I think this is Star 4? Well, it's Star 5. No? I don't think so. I don't think this is Star 5. But that means I will be seeing you guys in the next stream. Maybe tomorrow, maybe not. Bye bye.
