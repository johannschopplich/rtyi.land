you you Hello x-linx hello memos key I Learn Nintendo for life I Never can you get some social right? No, I don't Benjamin Damn all the YouTube people are here so early You We were working on the scent mom What did I do this week shit, I don't even know we do be working Hello claim in guten tag, you mean guten tag I don't made us The trillian German word for a toilet is poop and fartin No If you want you can say shy sauce It's equally funny is it not White chocolate brownies sounds amazing Oh Y'all be turk thank you for the sub I Sauce is funnier because it is an actual word. Yeah, that's something people actually say shy sauce I Listen to your process. I mean you're stamping the Yoshitomo level. It helps everything. Hello Selton Today's stream episode, uh, all the world programming Should someone drop to like 25 FPS. Uh, I think there were some places like that then we can check again real quick Let's see. How well of course two is doing right now. Oh I can't do that here. I have to do it in OBS Can you hear the game I'm not actually sure I Know that our worst setting in the scene was like this It's gonna take like 12 seconds to lock in Wait, actually longer takes like almost 20 seconds to lock the FPS and give it a little bit Doesn't look particularly lucky though, does it? Let's keep in mind we're still missing the occlusion plans once those are in this is like instant like 20 30 percent performance boost 25.7 yo, thank you for Shit I couldn't read it. I'm sorry. I don't know who donated or subscribed but thank you for doing that Welcome to the stream I Miss Rihanna, thank you, Rihanna Zip well the real Riolu, please stand up And your daughter doing I think they're still alive pretext You Okay, he works he's just gonna tell you to bust off basically The transfer is a volunteer month of data or margins are small amounts of data You can give me numbers and then I can tell you which one Their question is to open and it's to say yes or no Yes, the doctor Mario function and that's all the object dialogue stuff including making Mario face them and stuff like that Yes This is generally what you do in programming. You make complex functionality into a single thing if you have to reuse it everywhere No, they're not from 64 DS You know if I could pick a real-life stand I think It would be golden experience Requiem, but like if I couldn't pick that one stop platinum sounds pretty good For my money, I think I think star platinum is pretty good We Had a cool thing happening on the YouTube comments someone offered their help and they made these swings The name is Graham, how cool is that? Look how good they look Submitted by a YouTube commenter I Did simplify the geometry a bit, but this is like all their ideas You know, it does not work on music this is just random music I Am using The 3660 TI I Have a really good computer because I use it for Unreal Engine 5 development One of those were so far can bites a fortress over 400 kilobytes doesn't matter I Guess you would have to define what the transfer is but like both of those would just be many many small transfers of like 16 bytes I guess it depends on where in memory you put them and stuff like that Questions too complex basically All right, anyway, so He needs to be mean to you in the beginning I Have these the wrong way around I Was off lest you desire to feel the might of my stony mass What if he just speaks like that What's a different word for peep squeak like an old word it's weak That It's off net unless you desire I Healed the mind of my rocky mess my rocky behind all the best I Know I want him to talk weird. I think it will be funny if he talks weird That's my reasoning He said he's a special kind of bump. He he stands out by the way because he talks weird It's a g7 isn't that it's all I think all right I Think Morgan, there's just another day. I'm excited. Dude. I tried so much. I tried every single setting I have spoken to so many people I've been on the OBS help discord to try and get recording settings that work and No matter what I tried for the longest time it would randomly freeze my entire screen or skip frames Even now I don't get 60 FPS and I don't know what to do to get 60 FPS Something is seriously fucked and I'm glad I at least don't get random freezes anymore So unless you know exactly what the issue is, I am I'm not going to invest against further I'm just glad it kind of works now, and I don't want to touch it. I've generally put way too much time into it I This is weird It should be nice after the sandcastle like being nice And the sandcastle should be at the same moment. You should be nicer to you after he's gotten the sandcastle I Still like that Yeah, Nvidia software is pretty bad I use Nvidia broadcast like a really old version because it's the only one that works semi-decently When you webcam No, anything. I record a no BS. Maybe it looks 60 FPS, but it's only like 50 I Tried I went frame by frame What's a synonym for shape outline form physique bigger I Considered Linux. I can't I need Windows for work How's he gonna help Mario how's he gonna ask for help with the sandcastles? Well, I need Windows for work so I can't just use Dynux I do use double moon cell for this one though. Let's see right here Let's see if he asked for help it has to be in like a tsundere way he has to be like Don't even try to help me I can't help myself Myself Me touch my fourth stone not only us First I think that works There's synonym for stone it may touch this monument What's this Yes, this is a I'm saying it and he speaks weird He's trying to get help with the sandcastle someone built on top of me. I'm not the top of him It's atrocity Something other than the file use the filing I'm disrespecting my shape blaspheming Desecrating Desecrating my dome You're gonna be using the nomads from they will work on real hardware, yes, of course They have defiled me my beautiful cuboid form Fine, you shall touch this monument as far as it serves to get rid of this atrocity desecrating my dome It sounds weird. Ship it As it serves to get I Don't like this I start like an aristocrat. I thought it was good to make him start different. I Think you should talk different to like immediately make clear. Here's a different kind of form You fuck off links true Hey, bye-bye. Good luck. We got some 3d modeling help from the YouTube chatter. They made the swing. Isn't that nice? They made the textures, too I High swings, I think that's on you and not on the swing You got the stripes, I guess All right, and then once you save him He's like he's a friend. He's becoming nicer, but he's not like super nice Cloud kept a night cloud kept a night Queen. Wait, it's cloud kept done. No way already No way already That gives me done for am I stupid did I forget about that? Wait what I have like zero recollection of this I Didn't stream last week. Oh I didn't stream on on Tuesday. I know why I forgot to put in my time of requests. I'd work for Tuesday So I couldn't stream Oops I Can do that, I just want to finish that one texts god, it's so warm today So there's some really exciting things happening on n64 right now The publisher has contacted me they wanted me to port a game to n64 and it was pretty easy to do So we might get some new n64 releases in 2025 Hmm Nice What is perch Meaning All right to a light or rest on something I've got no mind Then at 91 he becomes nicer The horror project 64 is a great I don't know why people hate it so much it doesn't make any sense It's legit like the best emulator for casual playing that there is right now Like by a big margin Iris is kind of a banger to it. Oh, look at this. Just click the button. I'm not pressing anything Um, ah, there we go took a bit Iris is kind of a banger emulator, too This is for if you need like super and 64 accurate graphics, oh Yeah, what do you think of the camera sound I'm slowly getting used to it, but it felt really weird at first Oh Damn the audio is so much crisper on Alice You Like it Yep, there's a white screen toggle here doesn't work You guys like it awesome Okay, fine you guys think it should be quite up Let's see if we can make it quick. Oh I Doesn't seem right Hell I Think it's this value here Yeah, I saw all Dude, the YouTube drama recently went crazy There were so many people like rich review pirate software's code and even the fucking grifters were in on it And they're all being like he needs to put more or his code needs to be more Variable names instead of magic numbers. It's like shut the fuck up YouTube drama went crazy Hello Eden, is this volume better? Oh Yeah, that's the thing like their code legit is pretty fucking bad But then people dogpile on it and like they're just making shit up I Think is he hasn't finished the game after I'm a decade Well, of course, of course. He has a high ego. Of course. He's insufferable He's that I'm a person that like you watch once and then you just hate him for rational reasons and then you learn about them and then you hate him for rational reasons, but Now the grifters are out there just making shit up about him Still too loud. Let's just make sure I'm actually getting the right variable Several volumes in real life. You're not getting an option for the volume of one sound the fact live with it I'm not changing the right variable. I'm not but this was a good change. Anyway And this is like 10% quieter now I Don't know why I'm not changing the right variable Even I know nothing about the drama and they wrote really bad codes. That is true, but it is people are making stuff up they're like Yeah, they're calling things out that How about that Hello UED I Guess it could be slightly quieter, but we'll do a hundred All right sense bump nicer hmm now he's becoming a friend I Think it sounds off because this is like the first time you hear it Yeah, the original sounds like wow, it's like super long But I think it's a good thing I Stand from being nicer These are difficult change please to happy now, he sounds like a Like a snob like an aristocrat. He has to say pleased I Don't mind people being picky. I want people to be nitpicky and then I can decide to go with the nitpicks or not What's what's higher than acquaintance but less than friends It's not comrades that sounds like they're working together, but he's not working class Buddy That doesn't sound very I request our ocratic Associates chum mate Companion Fellow fellow sounds like a stranger to me I Adversary that's an enemy. Maybe he shouldn't say hello at all Hmm Maybe it's kind of bad that there's so many texts, especially if nothing changes with him I think maybe we should remove one and instead just like 70 and then 115 You Hello friends, oops In What if he confesses that he's actually stuck I Missed mistruth. That's what he would say. There's a piece on a mistruth. It's no time I've been Pretending he'll be resting But in reality But reality is cruel I'm stuck I Don't know He missed truth, I love that word it's like such a stupid way to avoid saying I've been lying I Mean what I've been building on myself recently. Oh, that's a good one I Okay, this is a text that you don't really There's a 90% chance. You would miss this if you were just playing the game. So this text is almost like an easter egg Desecrating What's wrong here How he's fun with an a And then in the end he no longer speaks like an aristocrat Oh Buddy Hmm so in the end he got married to like a sandbucket That's the idea here or like it just a sandcastle Because he's a stupid rock Oh What's that made out of silicium That's damn right silicium atoms Well, I have no idea nor a barrel I just use whatever VS code does Or you mean what's in game because then the answer is none of that it's a custom format You range with me like position chemical composition Silicon dioxide You What is rock made out of It's also silly Syndicates Or is it just silicate instead of the role you know, he should say something that was swift and efficient I am sure you'll be an excellent and cleanly beaches if that were to be required of you someday No, that's a good one I like that It's so dumb Are you sending me the thing? Let me zip them up and zip them to the cloud Hello on Rika Don't need to figure out what's going on with the camera Oh, yeah, of course tool is now almost done with the back fixing and off for beta testing But it's an email so many duplicates what enum I I Did not see an enum You mean this there's no duplicates and it's also it is really should be an enum, but it's just not Which is pretty fucking stupid How do you define an enum again just make this an enum real quick I Didn't make creme You There and should make this a little easier a little less stupid And it still works nice You Right on form sent. Yes, you are correct fine we can turn it down Would look a little better maybe. Oh Yeah, I finally looked through up every submissions today We got some pretty good ones You Really tough to get the brightness just right that seems maybe right Oh, wow, that's just a four megabyte file Oh Yes, you know what it doesn't matter It's gonna blend correctly in the end because we're gonna add up this island's color in the end. Anyway, it doesn't matter. It's fine Into my zip course. Thank you I Got me what you got me with what I got your nose What now You So you don't have peach in the beginning Sun bathing isn't having on the beach, nope, I Am on Windows 11 now and it fucking sucks. It's just worse than Windows 10 Ah We're missing some textures this button was not checked Let's try that again Hello case, I love you. Thank you Nicholas crippling. Thank you for loving me One of these liners because I need windows for work You Now to he added 140 kilobytes to the file Hey, all right, let's see what we got here 5,500 trying this that's a fair bit but fair enough Ooh, this is a nice stairs Now that's when the red coin star spawns now you see no longer in the middle I guess it was kind of junk in the middle fair enough The clouds look so fluffy now very nice Okay, this is a little weird I'm guessing something went wrong here Right What is going on here I'm confused. How's this possible? Oh What the fuck Okay Now it's missing vertex colors, it's this button non-deterministic somehow What the fuck I Am not sure what I'm doing, but that was not the right move It's Like it's missing vertex colors It's all lit Oh Why is the color so different Okay Okay, you know what let's just go through the changelog and then figure out what's been Different than expected here I've been glad to be my cloud like in shape with a flat bottom and more Asian bowl size and also they are pink Okay, that's very good I like it a lot Oh you're sick, oh I see but wait then why is this pink Okay, gotcha gotcha So I'm gonna have to untick lighting on everything here Mm-hmm RGBA 32, are you sure? That's what I get the RGBA 32 Actually, you know what if that one's okay fair enough if one's RGBA 2 Yeah, the one should be 2. Clouds that were sloped are now flat at the bottom with bigger cloud bubbles to compensate. Okay Sounds good. I actually had to add a bunch of polygons to make the lighting smooth plus 2,000 polygons But I'm also minus 7 mats. That should be fine because this level already ran pretty fucking well So I think the cell should have camera based lighting like banana or 64. I think this is the option that looks the best Okay can do I mean to do Change lights to match Pink lights and camera based lighting Ambient light color should be BCA 9 B7 except for clouds if possible for them. It should be. Oh, um, I Can't really just change it for one Well, I mean, I guess I can but like It wouldn't be very pleasant for anyone if I did What I did in the other level was I made it match And combiner wise which I might just have to do that This one has no lighting are you sure it's desired Oh God, maybe she does not like this I guess that looks better Without first now, there's not much I can do to make the clouds look better. Well, I think they already look pretty good. I Think we're fine. We need to circle rainbows extra smooth and basically no extra cost You know, I see We're just everyone doesn't want the boat check because they felt a bit cluttery and the boats kept playing for them You can read them if you like them. That's all good Do you think you're maybe narcissistic? No We designed the buildings to be consistent and color and look nice I like them a lot Yes, push this round apart I was all the building textures are handmade. Nice. We like to hear that Starting bowling now, it's a little step instead of being snoped and a cool fence Okay, I see okay, so you probably have to walk over here Such a nice is a thing you're saying that a narcissist I Don't know I think a lot of the time people Mistake like someone who believes in their ability for a narcissist which those are like maybe like egomaniac and narcissists, right? That's like a distinction to make there's also egocentric which a lot of people mistake for a narcissist Which like every narcissist is egocentric, but not every egocentric person is a narcissist Maybe I'm a little egocentric maybe have Strokes of egomaniac, but I think I'm extremely rational about my abilities and my limit of my abilities Defense is messed up also. Oh Let me recreate those shader nodes. Hey If I've had VS code now I've been having a blast with cobalt agent modding a pretty clever with making edits across files for tedious tasks I don't trust AI to edit my code base directly And if I were to first start in a building the rainbow kiss with that start, oh I see Don't narcissists typically don't think they're perfect and they have a strong desire for other people to call them perfect. Oh I see me Turk That does sound a little better Yeah, I could make this platform disappear with the star but I kind of like it should this maybe be billboarded by a back What do you think? Just billboard this one thing. So it's always looking at the camera I think that could look good You bought it or kill bought it Sounds like such a fake word, but I know what you mean Will be interesting to see if that works but alright is now a bit worm like and has new platforms for the coin Who nice worm? That's in the middle I've been moved around a little Yeah, that's fine remember those around and have some moon design for fun Sun and Moon Dabbling has a new fence and new look All right Doesn't to attach to this building anyway, but that's good The rainbows response to vertex color alpha. I was thinking that could be almost transparent and get Benzer when Mario walks in them. Oh Oh you want Mario to walk on these Initially they're non-solids. Oh You mean these Okay, I like that Take the rainbow platform Vertex alpha Oh This doesn't work This is that rgba 32 thing we were talking about in fast 64 discord a couple days ago This is a bit of a problem That's okay, that's okay, I think We can just do that right it's not gonna change anything I I Right, we just do that and make this one full solid Yeah, it should basically be equivalent Use out to Someone pinged me who dares That's not the button I wanted It's not the button I wanted. Where's the duplicate button? It's not an either I Why is this so tall I There we go You Know what? With this size we can actually use an rgba 32, but I don't think fast 64 supports this So we just have to deal with it That sucks The thing is you can you you quarter your team and instead of having it when you use an rgba a Sick 32, but no. Well, it is what it is. We have to live with it um Color right is now a bit warmer. Okay, where that permits them But it's awful a lot with the palace now is actual pillows Very nice pillows Since we're doing the palace is my best guess probably will need some adjustment Yeah, this looks pretty difficult to move across for an early level. I Probably will just make them thicker I designed the temple a little bit. It looks pretty nice Made the switch area look bigger so the pyramid will be less cramped. Yeah, very good call the pyramid was initially very stupid Added ramp to the pyramid and some more space for the switch Added big rainbows to the level background. Not too sure about the size. Ooh Yeah, these are gonna be extremely extremely big You have no idea how big these are they're gonna look like the size of planets Since this is a background that needs a really specific render mode I'll be fine. Actually finished in the on science. Nice All right, hmm now we need to import this somehow Yeah, true true Big-scale would be fine. How do you kill a window like this? Like that I remember from my first blender tutorial How you left the old geometry around oh wait, no, this is the collision map We don't need that we don't need that sure What a billboard bow Hey, this is fine, that's fine That's fine It's fine, if only we had convex hole calling it would make this level run a lot faster And these two oh wait, no it's with the middle Okay, and there's no calling here good Well, this shouldn't need cutting either. I'll just use this in here Mmm burger Okay, we cannot have a 5600 triangle collision mode Or 850 not bad To be separate How much should you sink into the clouds maybe like 10 coordinates By Zainab So We also clearly don't need the underside of these to be solid How about we do that Forget to delete all of it I Got I love ruining biomex models That is for sure a good call But I don't like the implications of that for the collision map I Will see what I can do I See I don't see any issues here The little east egg area under the starting cloud, I don't know what to put there if you have any concept on left. Oh Oh, oh, I see Yeah, we need to put something here So we're just because I was worried that there would be holes in the geometry if I move the cloud down But there does not seem to be anything like that, so we're all good Down to 2,000 triangles. Very nice. Wait, no. Shit. 3,000 triangles. There's definitely some collision triangles in here we can save if we really want. Yeah, I'll add that to my to-do list. Put something in there. What a beautifully awful song. Alright, how about we test this level? Oh nice, it made short exports too. Very good. Is that punishing for something with the music thing? No, I just felt like it. Nice skybox. You haven't even seen the skybox. What are you on about? No collision data to export. Oops. Let's actually listen to decent music please. You're gonna get so copyright struck. If I had the cannon open I would shoot with the cannon. Okay, so I would say the level works, but the background doesn't. I know why. I think I know why. Why is the billboard so small? What happened there? Kinda funky. Ah, yeah, here. This is what I'm talking about. I think those were the only spots. Is the play wall the way we want it? I think so, yes. Alright, this will now look infinitely better. Man, this level exports so fast. Where's my Mario at? Ooh, okay, what do you think? Still needs the lighting set. The billboard bone clearly does not work right. Oh, that's sick, Biomech. Okay, there's a minor issue with this one here. And the switch note's not fine either. Oh, something's weird in the background. Oh, I see the rainbows in the background. Honestly, the background is kind of hideous. The background really feels like a dragstone this whole stage. Anyway, let's figure this one out. I think if we want a shot at fixing this, we need Fast64Renderer. Oh, there we go. Minus 4 and minus 2. What's going on here? I don't know. I understand the mission. I don't understand the problem. Wait, what the hell is going on here? Oh, you cut it out, I see. Woodwings slipping into the clouds? I don't know about that yet. Is the vertex kind of just white here? I think it is. Let's just do this for simplicity. I think this is the idea. Let's just get rid of a few of these. Wait, what? I'm on ignore render. This is the idea, right? Then we also need to make it so that at the brightest point, it gets fully solid. How do I make that work? Probably like this? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Like this? What if instead of that, we use ShadeColorAlpha to learn between... Doesn't make any sense, nevermind. Where is CombineColorAlpha? Am I fucking blind? Is there no CombineColorAlpha here? What the fuck? Oh my god. This feels so possible. Alright. And then for the dark parts, we can just set it to zero. Alright! Where's your combiner, Matt? It didn't work for what we were going to do. Should be a little visible. We can do that, yeah. We can make it fade between something like that. Not that. Like that? We can do that. And we're done with setting the level. Once again, get the little stars while keeping them fairly visible. Did I accidentally make this invisible too? Oh no, that's just a FF64 renderer thing, I think. Your broke ass finally got the switch too? Nice, congratulations. Now you can play Mario Kart. Alright, next let's do the light. Aim. It's not perfect yet. Oh, guess we didn't set this in the... Let's set the light. Okay, for that we have to go through a little bit of pain now. Not a single one of these is allowed to have lighting set here. Which material is that? Yeah, I guess that makes sense, because they're all facing the same direction. Although that means they won't be affected by the camera light. Which maybe is going to look a little inconsistent. I could have just written a script for this. I guess we have to add a new one. Oh, you had exact values you wanted. Straight from above sounds correct to me. 49 in the cut them. Which level ID is that? I think this one is 1-6. 5-4-3-2-1-2. Yeah, and this one is 0-1-0, I remember. Okay, now we should have our lights here. Okay, now we should have our lights here. Okay, now we should have our lights here. Is this to your liking? That's about what we expected here. I do feel this slight pink glow. Oh wait, we need the light coming from the camera. They really do not follow the rainbow right now. And you wanted it from the camera. Okay. Doesn't really work that way. I don't have a setup like that for me and my engine. But we need it from the camera, otherwise it looks wrong. I think I need to add a new function here. I wish that I had that, I would soon come up with Mupen. You want to ask the Mupen devs, not me. The emulator can't play my game, it's kind of their fault, I think. Okay, I think we're good. Okay, I think we're good. Okay, I think we're good. Okay, I think we're good. Okay, I think we're good. This feels like it's not what you wanted. I mean, it looks very interesting, but also kind of not great. And this really looks like it's glowing. What happened, what did I do wrong? What happened, what did I do wrong? That looks more like it. Not really, though. I'm not sure what's going on right now. Oh, I know what's going on, actually. It's using the ambient light from the level color and not the camera. Okay, wait. Is it this way around? Is it having it the wrong way around the whole time and it didn't notice? That looks terrible now. What the hell? This is now just a stupid white light. Oh, shit. Yo, thank you for the 50 Noc. I don't know what that is. I don't know if that's a lot of money or very little money. I'm sorry. But I appreciate the sentiment regardless. Dude, I'm so confused. What is going on here? How is the light supposed to be working? Wait, light and then ambient. So the first is the directional light and the second is the ambient. So this should be working. Is this a Project64 bug? We should look at this in the other emulator just to be safe. What about the effects similar to the eyes, nose and walls? Is it supposed to go with the structures? Sure. 5 bucks means proportional to how long I could stay? Don't worry, you're not obligated to donate. I appreciate it either way. See, imagine if everyone did that. I would be fucking rich instantly. I want that. I want that. I want that. It was fully black for some reason. When it's supposed to be pink. Wait. You said pink ambient. First is directional and the second is the ambient, right? So it should be this. Do I have it right now? I may have confused myself a little. There we go. Okay, finally. I did confuse myself. Now we have pink light coming from not on the camera. And it's very visible that this is glowing. And I don't like it. I'm gonna change that. I hope that's okay. Is it not glowing? Am I stupid? It looks like it's glowing to me. Does it not look like that to you? Like it doesn't actually go darker with the thing? Yeah, look, it doesn't multiply with light. There we go. Anything else? Dude, this ugly line in the background is pissing me off so much. I'm going crazy. Why is that there? That needs to be fixed. Can I really live with that though? Look at this. Man, how? How am I supposed to live if that's right there? Oh my god, it's in the texture. It's just heart baked into the texture. You can't be serious. How did I fuck this up that bad? Yeah, I guess I have to live with that. Alright, airship time. Alright, this might be important. I'm writing a program to optimize Fast64Xbox. Okay, he found like an 8% reduction in vertices. Oh my god. Look at this. From 29,288 to 27,500 triangles. That is crazy. That's going to optimize our level so much more. Anyway, we have this to work on now. Didn't make the animations though. All good. Looks great to me. Found a question. Updated the shape and look to fit the level? Yes, you did. What's this bone? What does this bone want to be? Spark bone. Is it all parented correctly? No. There we go. Average is done. Actually, I don't like that this is centered around here. This is going to have bad implications for the collision radius. Because it has to be solid in a much bigger radius if we do it like that. So I am going to edit this slightly. Should be maybe like this. 860. Now, Biobank is remaking old levels. And we are reimporting those remakes. But also, yes, we have to port old levels back to the new engine. Because some things are no longer compatible. Would go through the hue stages with the sunset. It is way too late for that. Should have brought that up before Biobank started the rework. Not going to rework again. Ornaments on the sides and front should be cut out in decals. Oh, and we are on FBX normal. And we are on FBX normal. Thank you for the 500 CLP. I have no idea how much that is. Am I rich now? Did you just give me like 50 cents? I don't know. But thank you for the money. I don't think we need to cut out decals yet. I think they are going to look better as transparent decals. It is 50 cents. Let's fucking go, dude. We are balling. This is kind of a high poly collision model. I kind of have to reduce the tricot. I think what we should be doing here already is... Do that. This is going to make it so you can actually grab these statues here. It is going to make it slightly less like currents. But it is going to improve playability, so I am fine with that. We can get rid of these here. At least the lengths I went to in order to get these fucking wing textures. Where are they from? Is this the vanilla one? What happened here? Good cruise ship, Hana. Did you rip this from Smash Bros. Brawl? I don't know. These are Parasocial's friends. True. We should invest in this Parasocial relationship. Hello, L-Ultra. Not L-Ultra. That is probably why I thought you did that, because I would have done that. Ain't that crazy how I am consistent like that, is it not? Yeah. Yeah, crazy how I can make things look this good with so little triangles. How I can do that. It is all me. It is awesome that I can do this. No one else can do this. It is just me. It is just me. Alright, 116 triangles on that should be fine. Where the fuck did it export to? What? Without a name? It just exported as armature. What is this one? Polygon? I don't know. What is this? What is this? Okay, exciting things happening. We might have a huge vertex load reduction. If we do that to course 1, I think that puts it from 56 to 58 FPS. Okay. 0, 8 and 9. Okay. Actually, I am not going to make an animation for this. But I will export a 0 animation. What is the tiniest bone in the world doing here? Okay. Alright. Loud underscore collision is missing. I don't know why. I don't know why. Alright, we should have ships in-game now. No animation. I really need to fix that camera issue. Oh, okay. So, there is more issues here. But it does not look like anything. I see why. Boat-less? It did not want to be a stark bone. It wanted to be a geodesplenished bone. What the fuck did I just hit? Okay. That is a fast 64 bug. I don't know exactly what the bug is. It is like with Pucci too. Okay. Do all the materials have the light on? Okay, a little bit of this going on here. Not used in CC. Okay, we probably want to add the light here, right? Otherwise this is going to look inconsistent. Okay. I went through the ship that was not even there. Okay. Oh, these look like they should be decals actually. Okay. Culling back here is actually a huge optimization. And we really want that. Oh wait, nevermind. It is not what I thought it was. Okay. Okay, that one is culling back. Man, there is plenty of materials on this one. Okay. It looks good, so it is good. Okay. I definitely need to make the ships follow the path better. Is it just me or does it not look like we have camera light anymore? Okay. Am I crazy? Camera light is black now? Yeah. Okay. I guess the light was set mid-level, I think. Okay. Look at this shit, what the fuck? Why is there so much of that here? We disabled lighting on everything, did we not? Why does it set this here? Huh? White slabs? Oh. How did that happen? Okay, I fixed that. And that is why you cannot have the light checkbox checked. Because that will happen. Okay. There we go, much better. We are going to program these. Okay. That is a fucked up level, though. What is fucked up? Is it because they did not give them the color that you wanted? Because I can change the color of my drawing, but it would be a huge pain in the ass. They are gray shaded? Oh? There is no longer any influence of light on here. Everything is gray shaded? Wait, what? I thought I did a route. Okay. Was it always wrong, or is it just now starting to be wrong? Let me see if this is better. Is that it? Is that what we wanted? Did I fix it? Okay. The difference is too minor for me to perceive it, unfortunately. Is it gray right now? What the hell? Okay. I am all clueless as to what to do right now. So how about we do it later? We do it later. Still dark gray instead of dark pink. Really? This looks pink to me. Like, now it is whitish, and now it is starting to be pink. Okay. Am I wrong? Oh wait. I think now I know what she wants. I got it. It is going to be this. Oh, that is pink as fuck. That is going to be it, right? That is what you are thinking of? Nice! Okay, we got it. It looks pretty cool. Alright. Next asset. Cloud spawn. Wait, cloud spawn? Doesn't feel like a cloud cap asset. Let's do the catch cloud first. Because this is actually in the cloud cap level. Oh, okay, I see. Nevermind, this seems like a lot of work. Fine, we will do the cloud spawn first. Oh yeah, this also has custom light. We can't do that, it is just not possible. Unfortunately, it is just going to be this. It looks nice though. It is going to be another color, in this case pink. Yes, exactly. So it will look pink in this level, but not in others. I think we can at least jump through the clouds. We need to change the brim color per level that is in it. Oh, I see. Okay, we can't do that, but that is going to be a little annoying. Can I just copy it from the ambient color of the camera? That is so dumb. Okay, let's do that. This is going to sound like snow. Okay. Okay. A little bit of a problem. I see the problem. I have no idea how this guy works. I snapped too close or whatever. It makes no sense to me. It seems so unworkable. Wait, what? This collision makes no sense. I am just making a new one. Okay. That is why it should be more pink to match. I imagined a movie. But we will see. Okay. This almost works. The only problem is Mario falls through the clouds after spawning them. Because of timing issues. Looks good too. It snaps to whatever the fuck it feels like. It snaps to what you hover over. This has to be when Y and Z are swapped on your keyboard. Some people have to be like this. Others are swapped. I can't do anything. Okay. What's next? Catch clouds. Now a wing cloud from Yoshi's Island. This is going to require a bit of work to import. Okay. One material. Very nice. Selected. Except I am objectively correct. Americans when they start counting on 12. And the first day of the week is Sunday. An art that was planned by me. This is going to take a while. Okay, the size seems fine. Cute endgame. Catch clouds. It's called just clouds underscore zero. That's a terrible name for an art. We gotta work with what we have. You're not going to compare me to an American? Fair enough. I'm sorry. Anyway, I would need to animate this. So I will send this for animations to Zena before I import this. And I think we're done for today. And... I can definitely stream again on Tuesday, I think. So we'll see. In the meantime, I'll get Course 2 stuff finished. I'll spend the week maybe making a few more optimizations. I have a couple ideas. I want to finalize the engine already. We're basically done with the engine now. Maybe BVH collision and small revrun improvements. And Sauron wanted to do something with the music. And then after that, we're finally free from working on the engine. Check the caps? Okay, fine. He's too excited. Cloud hat. Nice, very glowy. Looks good. What's the other one? Bomb flower? Also looks great. Very cartoony. And the bomb cab. Alright. I think this is going to look amazing in the end. Especially the reflection here. But yes, we will continue this on Tuesday. Until then, bye bye!
