Hello. Oh, no, I'm probably Howdy, Lamington. The desert song is a banger. True. I like it a lot. Oh, wait, wrong audio output. What's up? Thank you for the sub, Brojinxie. Everything Banduke makes a banger, true. I'm thinking maybe there's a new tech that was revealed today where you can decompress songs at runtime on the N64. I'm thinking maybe it would be cool if we made a cartridge with all the RTYI songs and sold that separately. How have you been? Pretty well. Life's going well. Nothing to complain about. Zayna! Welcome back to the Yoshi gang. I feel like you were never gone. Meowdy, partner. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm suggesting. Not a random. Songs. Howdy, Biobak. I'm sure we've all been hearing the song all over the Internet the past two weeks. Do you guys hear the things in the song? Because I do. And I think they're perfect. We need the chippy chippy cat, true. Maybe a mod can add that somehow. I don't know how it works. I feel like you could add that to the channel, Zayna. What are you talking about? What do you mean, what am I talking about? You don't know the wow wow thing? I don't know what it's called. I feel like at least one person knows the name for that. It goes well, well. That must sound like the most insane, unhinged thing you've ever heard if you don't know what I'm talking about. Grown tube. It is a grown tube. You are now watching a lucky penny shop product feature. You know what that is? It's got an open end. Yeah, that one. Today, we're going to be working on the saloon, the milk bar. I have some pretty cool ideas for it. I'll tell you in a second. I just wanted to make sure this works fine. Hell yeah, the dry bones guy will be so fucking happy. We still need to do the animations, but like them. The other day, I are in a fucking cowboy themed restaurant. Perfect, dude. You know exactly what we have to do here now. You're getting into the mood? Howdy, partner. All right, I will just let you know, this will be a cowboy bar. Oh, fuck. It will be a milk bar. Lachlan is right. Dude, Lachlan is going to fucking lose his mind. Okay, let me let me get into the bar again. Where's the glass of milk? I don't have one on me right now. All right, so this will be the bar. On the right side here, there's going to be like a whole bar section. There's going to be some tables over there. I'm thinking two offering tables. Maybe there's a little bit of a stage here. And everyone here is going to be drinking milk. And there's going to be a secret room here, because there's going to be some guys, they're not satisfied with milk. They need something a little stronger, a little illegal. They're actually not going for milk, they want chalky milk. So there's going to be a secret room where a bunch of bad guys sit around the table drinking chalky milk. And you're going to be in here. You're going to be going to tables and you're going to be overhearing their conversations. And the conversations are going to be stuff like, oh, I heard there's a secret door. If you want something a little stronger, you just need to find it. And then somewhere along the walls, there's just going to be a doorknob. And if you walk next to the doorknob, Mario is just going to open a door in the wall. It's going to blend in perfectly. And then you entered in the room. And there's going to be the bad guys. I'm thinking two snifits and a shy guy. And what are they going to say? We got caught chalky handed. Let's get out of boys or something like that. Hello, Asuku. And that's the idea. When y'all think, where does the milk come from? I don't know. The Moomoo's give them a slight physical change. So they are a new species and technically not Dry Bones. Well, I'm guessing they do look a little different from all the other incarnations of Dry Bones, don't they? Dude, I like these barrels so much. They ended up looking so good. The way they come out of here. Yeah, the Dry Bones actually look pretty good to me. Oh, that's a bug. Yeah, and if you ever been to Moomoo Meadows. Of course, there's cowboys in the Mario universe. Oh shit, what if the Dry Bones are harder to beat in the space because of all the milk they drank when they were alive? Oh, that's dude, that's the lore is going deep. I like that idea a lot. How do we convey that though? Also, let's listen to Westworld OST. Yeah, but why are you doing this in the first place? And for what? I guess it's to make things more funny in the course. What do you mean to make things more funny? It's for the mission. Ground point to defeat instead of a single jump? Well, we need to visually convey it somehow. And we also need something to happen when you jump on them. To have Mario and Cowboy friends run the Mario Party together. It's possible, but I'm not 100% sold on the idea. It's actually making Dry Bones harder, you could just have the milk be the reason Dry Bones exist in the first place. Yeah, we could have some lore drop about that. Something like the milk makes our bones so strong that even if we die, our skeletons are still alive. Toad's head is canonically his head. Hello, Sayo. Dude, Biobak, we need to use your window technique here. Look at this. It's so perfect, dude. The setup is here. The fucking universe aligned to make this happen. No lie. The entire universe came together just to make the combiner happen. Is this a song request? Oh. Okay. I like that. Fuck it. We're doing that. I'm going to make them bigger and slower. You should put a picture of me as an easter egg on the wall. No. Actually, if you pay me $20,000, I will do it. But it will be very small. That's 85, so 256. What is the reason we're using CNN object-oriented languages or any other one? There's like no difference between C++ and C. They're like the same thing. The hell? What's the difference between C++ and C and like functionally? Yeah. Being object-oriented is not a property of the language. It's a property of your code. I can do object-oriented programming in C. Who's going to stop me? Just object-oriented. Does C have class? We have structs. This is basically classes. What's the difference between the class and the struct? I guess you need like a class to call a function, but you can also just cast it. C is just C++ with less casting required, I think. And my main job, like my full-time job is being a C++ programmer for Unreal Engine and I'm saying this. Love at Mario's feeble attempt to jump on him. Yeah, it's templates, but you can do most of a template still with defines, I think. Yeah, I'll make my own game someday. Macros like compile-time checking and stuff? What? Templates too, right? No? Actually, yeah. Compile-time. Fair. Fair, actually. Wait, no. How do macros like compile-time checking? If it doesn't, you're going to get an error if it doesn't compile. So I'm going to see if C++ is better than C and some of you will have this mindset that every C program should be rewritten in C++. But they are the same. They are the same thing. You can have templates. Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. I guess C++ has a few more features, but I don't need any of them. I think we're fine. Okay. I also find C++ very, very annoying to use, to be honest. All right. Now you can no longer kill them with a ground pound. Without a ground pound. I'm going to make a note for the NPC. Um... One guy that tells you the lore that the Dry Bones here are really strong because of all the milk they drink at the saloon. Hey partner, just a word of advice. The Dry Bones in them hills, they got real strong bones. They spent their whole life drinking milk, so your little jumps ain't gonna do much. Just thought I'd warn ya, since you've helped the town. Okay, well this might happen before you help the town. So we're just gonna... Also instead of, hey partner, it should say, howdy partner. Howdy partner, just a word of... What'd they say? Word of advice? What's the cowboy version of word of advice? Dude, this song is amazing. I love it. Just a word of advice. They would say something else. Quick little tip. Nah, that's not the cowboy. That's not cowboy slang. C'mon. How often do you use RGBHC attacks versus Intensity Attacks? I find myself using it 99% of the time these days. Mmm... 90% is maybe a little much. But... Yeah, 75% maybe. Although, I guess this level specifically, it's more like 100%. Yeah, I guess in this level it's 100%. It happens a lot. English to cow by Google Translate. I think those are really Lila. See, for the dialogue, I think... This account here is very good inspiration. I mean... Right, we're gonna do stuff like that. But where's the text? Zed Partner, I hope you're ready for a duel. Yeah, this is pretty great. But what do they say for words of advice? Hmm... I just thought it might work. Darn dude, you're right. You are. Listen closely, partner. Well... Listen closely, yeah? Let me show you the ropes around here. Oh... Well, he's not showing you anything though. Word to the wise? Yeah, I was thinking something with wise too. Word to the wise... Hmm... You better wise up, partner. Something like that. Okay, ask CGPT. Make this sentence sound more like a cowboy said it. Howdy partner just a bit of cowboy wisdom for you them dry bones up on them hills they're tough as all leather spent their days guzzling milk so wrecking your little hops ain't gonna make a dent figured i'd tip my hat and give you a i like this they should have some mighty dev bones they've been sipping on milk their whole darn life so them little jumps of yours won't do any good yeah yeah the damn little jumps of yours reckon i give you a little friendly tip all right i like that i reckon i give you a friendly tip them dry bones up in them hills they're tough as all leather spend their days guzzling milk so wrecking your little hops ain't gonna make a dent yeah okay this is perfect so yeah ai is a very good tool case american ark anyway let's plan the layout for the little tavern here well most of the layout is already planned but we gotta make sure it actually plays well as well i don't want the camera to be too claustrophobic let's see what size the entrance should be we should add saloon doors here i'll make a note for that swinging saloon doors and saloon doors let's swing he's messed with my blood.c code and i can't forgive him for that the fuck is blood.c khaki dev want to know what's even worse i also changed your your change from code i added new action states to him he can do more things now i feel like the gray makes it too really you think we should not use gray mud as the floor do you think maybe also we should give uh the saloon walls i don't know i feel like that's a crazy concept that might work oh yeah guys twitch gave me the recap of who chatted the most in my chat on twitch actually streamlabs did who do you think won what do you think the winner is Lilaa Lilaa we got Lilaa votes whoever spams the most all right the winner is Lilaa free tv and second is zaina and third is skyloft damn khaki dev really changed his ways he fell off to be honest with you i read a few messages but they are it sounds like a reddit comment so yeah i'm also a big chat gpt user i feel like people that saying it's useless are just coping maybe because they're useless  hey i use okay but if you want to know how you combine two arrays together in unreal engine 5 and you don't want to type out the whole code you can just put that into chat gpt and it will give you the exact code isn't that nice or if you want to know how minerals behave when they're ready to breathe you can just put that into chat gbd so yes but yeah that's true i used to try to recording albio but that takes so fucking long have you ever watched a coding tutorial it's miserable i'd rather just google the answer and instead of googling i can just use chat gbd that's basically what i'm doing it's just a better google you need to for game maker you don't need to that's the point you can use chat gpt that's what i do i know a bit of drinks babe when they're wanting to read because everything is doing it's oh no kakita i'm sorry that happened to you well i feel like ai is just gonna become more prominent in the future so there's no reason not to and yeah i mean obviously it doesn't always work and you shouldn't over rely on it you still have to be able to do all these things by yourself i'm just saying it does these a lot faster than you would be able to so why wouldn't you take advantage of a great tool i feel like this level needs a staircase the inside of this needs a staircase to get to the second layer here what is it bitch from it's probably just a rum i just amuse hello tanya retro gaming this cat is gonna be the next chippy chippy chapachapa yeah okay we want the bar to be like from here to here we want there to be tables here and i want there to be like almost a little stage here maybe the staircases should be next to the stage like from here to here i feel like that would be a good place for a staircase to be that would make sense would you allow people to implement it because i'm sure if it's open source it's open source i don't know i feel like the morality of just hacking games is already questionable to begin with and i feel like if someone makes a hack then everyone should just be allowed to use that guy's hack and there's nothing he can do because he did it against nintendo's consent so if you complain about people using your hack for something you're just being a little bitch that's my view on this so will you add the alcohol no there will not be an alcoholic how do we best make the staircase look i'm not sure morality nah wait what what am i missing okay the left wants you not to inhale asbestos you need to inhale asbestos no no i'm talking about hacking someone else's hack like that's like okay i feel like if you hack someone else's game without their consent you should also be fine with someone hacking your hack against your consent that seems logical to me so so so yeah that is a bit of a weird situation i agree but i think the reason companies discourage modding is not because they think it's gonna harm their brand it's probably because they need to protect their ip otherwise they're gonna lose their ip privileges the giga leak had nothing to do with the open source mario 64 code those are 100 unrelated people just keep correlating them but they actually have nothing to do with each other we don't use any of the neat code in the decomp at all in fact it would be completely incompatible they use different systems there what about motors true actually none of yours leaked used leaked code except for arthur chile he is the only bad person arthur chile is the devil arthur chile is the antichrist you didn't notice the music before dude listen to this yeah this level has not always had music this one's such a banger so if the whole um decompressing in mp3 on n64 in real time and playing a thing works out the one that libdragon is working on right now i'm probably gonna make a separate cartridge and gonna release this with a box where it's just the rty iost we're gonna sell it for like a hundred dollars or something with a box and like a custom cartridge and like an instruction booklet and stuff like that how fucking cool would that be how many need opus for that so the entire ost fits on there in high quality and there's a flash drive with the bps you have to load it up with your rom and i'm good to go forcing you to buy and use the console no no you will be able to listen to it on soundcloud obviously it's gonna be like a cool souvenir you know it's like theoretically useless but very cool that's what a souvenir is supposed to be you love me i have never heard of you how do you love me when did you fall in love with me and why what did i do yeah and what have been the soundtrack cards being sold obviously the normal rom you can just get for free and the soundtrack you can also just get for free but it would be really cool to have a physical thing from the game dude those tumbleweeds are so annoying why are they so loud something's wrong with the tumbleweeds oh i see okay they need a minimum velocity here i saw the new smash remakes update i left a comment there telling them that they need to improve their performance i played smash remakes on n64 with four people it's a really cool game but god damn i want decent frame rate please the game is so slow i don't want to meet herk i really want to fuck with the dry ones guy would be so funny if you disable the comments only on that's not a Lilaa type of comment the game genuinely runs like 30 percent with four people if you do that maybe just to make sure nothing goes wrong you could use yeah yeah definitely will Lilaa so what are you running it on an n64 beat arc what do you mean what are you running the n64 game on yes an n64 mod the smash 64 remix no it's an n64 mod not a wii mod  pme i would never ever play project them i think that is absolutely awful i don't like it at all hmm how do stairs look like in a saloon it has all your favorite rare characters oh gee i love my rare characters case with the hot tanks yep that's how we know i love him so i feel like pm kind of removes character identity every character kind of feels like it plays the same and everyone just says combos for nothing that's why i don't like it it's like they looked at me and were like this character has a flaw let's fix it like i don't know if this is a hot take but giving mr game and watch like a decent sized shield that's just removing the entire character identity that's like the one thing he was known for you can't just take every character and remove their weaknesses and expect the game to be fun because now it's just like the so i want to make sure okay okay that sounds more fun the only way k's can have a hot tank is by conforming them that's true actually all my tanks are so unpopular and bad but yeah so i just came in when king said thank you so much sad music This breathing almost sounded like he's crying. I'm already making my saloon here. I'm happy with what I got so far. Paycase more, huh? Surely wouldn't mind if I was paid more, but where's this coming from? He needs to fund RTYI? Oh, I need to fund RTYI, that's true actually. I would like to pay a lot of artists that help with this game. I'm definitely gonna pay Barduke for the OST if we do end up making that cartridge. How do we best make this work? Do we just have this be slanted as well? Actually I think that might work best. Let's try that. That doesn't feel real. That feels more real. I mean, that makes sense for James Lambert to do that. Who's gonna stop him? Actually, legally I guess Valve could stop him. I'm not interested in ever using more than 8MB just because the original N64 games didn't do it. And going beyond the original limitations is just kinda against the spirit of the challenge. At that point, why not just make a game for emulator? Yes, I'm working on Return to New Zealand. This is for a milk bar saloon. I'm working on the outline right now. Dude, I posted something about Mario 64 on Twitter yesterday. And someone said you have no source for this. And I replied I am the source and they deleted their comment. That's power. I think this works. The question is where do we put the secret door? Here feels a little bit cliche. We gotta put a table here. We gotta put a little stage there. This is gonna be the bartender. We're gonna have chairs here with guys on it. I have not played Gex now. I don't know what's gonna be up here. This is all too tight to put tables actually. Oh, what the hell? Dude, we have finished the whole level since then. And reworked some old stuff. You've been here in the stone ages. Dancing cow with a secret warp. No. What the fuck? No, I have no straw. Hello, stick figures man. No. We have plants here. Yes, there will definitely be pokies. There will also be cactuses. We still need those. Someone offered to make the cactuses but they didn't get back to me in three weeks. So it's probably that. I don't like the top part. The top part makes no fucking sense. It needs to be bigger. There needs to be more space to just walk on. What if we do something like that? And that. Is that gonna work camera wise? I hope so. Oh, yeah. Actually, I have more things to talk about. So I was watching someone speedrun Lost Impact yesterday during the winter speedrun marathon. And I realized, dude, there are so many cool ideas in Lost Impact actually. Like it's crazy how packed with ideas that game is. And I was looking at RTYI and I think we have a similar idea density. So that's good. But I am noticing, I find that the Ulrich theme is a little uninspired. And I find that some of the other themes I had planned for course 13, 14, 14 and the side level. Maybe they're also a little bit uninspired compared to how they were in Lost Impact. So we probably want different themes. And I thought back to how I came up with the Lost Impact themes. And usually all the themes in Lost Impact were just things that literally came to me in a dream. That's probably why they feel so inspired to me. And I think we should use that approach for the level themes. No, not ShedGBD and Twitch chat time. More like just like, you know, cool shit time. Just like things that I look at them and they make me go like, yo, this shit's cool. Let's look at more of the ancient natural shit. I mean, course one is natural. Course two, the Dino Dino Domain. Kind of natural. It's kind of like an overgrown temple. Course three is natural. Course four is still kind of human made. Course five is a ghost ship. Eh. Course six is an ancient dino land. Course seven is the Kuba. Yeah, I mean, it's not really industrial. It's still like medieval tech. No, but I was thinking. Um. We should just go with crazy themes or just like random things that come to me in my dreams. And one neat idea I had that I think would maybe work is instead of. OK, I'll just show you my notes that I have written down. So for course 13, 14 and 15, I'm very unsure. Course 15 was going to be like a city. It's kind of like a comic book and you're the hero. Course 14, I was thinking maybe an oversized casino, but I don't like this. Course 13, I had first written the music level. Which I also don't like. Then I was thinking maybe a dream level where it's like you go into someone's dreams and it's like a bunch of relatable childhood things. I was thinking the desk level from Lost Impact. But I also recognize that childhood experiences like that are not super universal. So it would be kind of a confusing level. And the last idea I had was that it would be like a space station, like a space shuttle. Maybe you can do some gravity fuckery in here and you would help like friendly NPCs in the space station fight against space pirates or whatever. I don't know who Radiohead is, Mr. Comet. I wouldn't know. And dream about a giant rat. I feel like you can get the ideas from Yak from the MIPSOL wiki. Wiki is all about documents of MMOs. It's a video of the Iceberg Race. Just putting my two cents. That's an interesting idea. Yep, Jinxing. All of that is actually planned. Like literally all of that. Comic book level especially is weird. Yeah. I thought the exact same thing, by the way. You heard my stomach growl? Damn. Was it that loud? You heard it all the way upstairs? Well, there's one in Sunshine. Yeah, but overall, all the ideas you mentioned are already planned. So I think those are good ideas. We can have more tables up here now. I think this is a better size here. Yeah, so the space station is probably a go. The other two, not so much. Drink water? Fine. We also have... Three more side levels. One bowser level. Two normal side levels. For the side levels, the first one was going to be like a mushroom-type forest. The second was going to be an arctic with a little toy train and like ice cream everywhere. I think that works very well. It's like a big toy city and there could be a giant Shanghai. That sounds so dumb. That's a monstrously bad idea. Sorry, Mr. Comet. I forgot my manners. You're missing the all-important snow level. Actually, true. But how do we make a good spin on the snow level? Dude, snow levels are so overdone. Mario 64 had fucking two of them. I don't want another bowser level, you know. Yeah, One Piece has a lot of cool ideas for worlds as well. Hike and mountain climbing level? I don't like hiking and mountain climbing. What's wrong with Blender? Isn't Blender perfect? How long do you think it would take to just remake Blender? Like goddamn. Can you show the new stuff I made? The merch stuff? Right, so I have Pixel Empire now as my merch store thing. And we were thinking of making stickers. So that would be like a skill issue sticker you can put on something. Zayna thought the I hate video game thing is good. We had to make one for Peach's Fury because this is a very popular hack. The HA sticker. This one's my favorite. Just program well. And maybe a Mario 64 one. But I don't know if anyone would actually buy these. But I think they're cool stickers. Huh? Well, I say, huh? That's what I say. Huh? There is a Rambo sticker actually. It's the most popular piece of merch right now actually on my merch shop. I don't know about either. Over time, if you fall in a hole, ice melts and becomes a Jurassic level. We already have a Jurassic level. And that sounds like really painful to implement. But I'm making this saloon. Well, it would be Pixel Empire that gets into trouble, I think. I always ask them, are you sure this is fine? And they say yes. With those stickers, I also asked them like, do you guys think it would be fine? Maybe I should trust them less actually, now that I think about it. Yeah, actually. Maybe they're just fucking with me. Maybe I am actually the one taking on the legal responsibilities here and just fucking myself over. Hmm. Well, okay. Deer antlers don't fit Mario. But if we have a Mario version of deer antlers. Remember when he said there's a level where a mirror plays something? Why not have the outside of it be snowy? Hmm. Right. That was an idea for like a mirror world where there would be like a snowy area. And like you'd go in there and you'd go from like the bright side to the dark side. I think that is something that can still work. As a course. But I think we need the idea to like tie it all together. And I just haven't had that. Hello, Retroboy. Just be the Bullyhorns. Yeah, I guess that could kind of work. Modding stuff is going well. We are modding right now. I'm gonna put some fencing up here. And then maybe two tables on each side. Then maybe a table here. Probably a table here. Some barstools. And then we're good. I think that works. My fucking legs hurt so bad. Holy fuck. I was doing squats today. And I'm on my cut again. So I'm losing weight. But I increased the weight for my squats. And that's a bad combination. No, there's not a hidden gambling room. There's a hidden Chalky Milk room. They're secretly drinking Chalky Milk in one of the rooms. What is MiniOMG property exporter and how do I get it? It's a special plugin made by the Cozys. It's in the first 64. Let's get somewhere. You won't need it. How about an ice cavern level? We already have a little ice cavern in the cave level. So I think we got that idea covered. I don't know if there's any additional benefit to making a whole course on that theme. I think games like this really are about conveying ideas. More different areas one day. Like an Egyptian palace, a real museum.  Yeah. Yeah. You can just put in Mount Silver for 1 gold. I'm not just putting a Pokemon level. The hell? I don't know. Alright, let's put some fencing up here. The fencing should go all the way down here I think. Deep sea level? We have a deep sea level. Have you not seen deep sea level? All alone bubbledome? Dude, the deep sea level we have is so good. Why is YouTube so active today? It's because they know what's good. They have a good taste in electronic entertainment. So will you last tank? I don't know. Hard to predict what's gonna happen. I can't imagine that I will ever just stop creating. That doesn't sound like me at all. What would be the point of an existence where you don't create? That's like the whole purpose of the human soul. And you're gonna go without it? Damn. Are you even alive anymore at that point? Is it very dark? Lots of hidden danger. Then again, it might be too dark. We already have a deep sea level. Just making the level darker doesn't help. Yep, we're making the level work. We're also already gonna do a few textures here. Oh, you're at 360p, yeah, well, no wonder you are not gonna enjoy the YouTube chat. You can't even read it. Thinking of how it's moving also, or motor engines, a level or a collection of levels on the move. That's kind of the idea behind the space station level. The level is gonna be like a relatively small space station, like a space shuttle with just things happening to it as you go. I think that's a really cool fantasy play. I think that's at the heart of Mario Galaxy 1, kinda. It has a very cool vibe to it. What do you call placeness? It has placeness. Maybe that's the correct word here. Yes, placeness. That is a good word. This looks terrible. Awesome. I don't know what to do with this.    That looks less terrible. How do you find placeness? Hmm. When something... Feels like a place. There's like a discernible idea you get and you feel like you are living in that idea. Star Road has no space station idea? What? Why does Star Road have a space station? I don't think there's one. There's a space level. I wonder if it's a frozen place like Yoshi's Island. The area features could be frozen hats, ancient mark places, a palm tree and the snow. Huh. Well, they already have a prehistoric level though. Having two of them? Okay, but that's like a stationary space, right? I was thinking like a moving space shuttle or something like that. Immersion? Immersion doesn't quite fit it. What? Wait, where are the windows? Shit. Is that level made yet? Which one? If I had to remake an old hack... The smallest one, so I have to do the least amount of work. Yeah, the prehistoric level is made. It's course 6. We made it a longer time ago. Okay. What's with these Yoshi Valley wall textures? They are... Hoshi, are you being a Lila? I see what you're doing. Shit. New Lilaa DLC dropped. Why is this a thing? Actually, I guess it kind of works. Yeah, we have a few slides. But actually, I want more slides and I want more cool platforming sections. That is one thing I noticed lacking in this game. Actually. I don't know why I'm doing this. That's actually why we are going to... You're gonna hate this. We're gonna rework part of course 2. The Divine Dino Domain. There's an inside section where it's just like a water raft going around and you collect red coins. It's lame as fuck. Instead, it's gonna be mostly a platforming section. I think we can do something cool. We even already have like fling vines that you can use to get over gaps. We just need to properly introduce them, which is gonna be difficult. We need to think about something for the windows though. Because you see how there's two windows here. And then you come. And there's like the whole wall being blocked. We're gonna do something. We can just add the window here. It's gonna look very good. Oh, the floor actually looks really good.      I like the floor a lot. This whole cabinet though is kinda in the way here. I could just shorten it. Yeah, I think if I just shorten it, it's gonna be fine. Or I rotate it a little bit. Or I move it to the other side actually. Yeah, yeah, actually that's a better layout. Let's move this to the side here. Maybe we can align this here. Remove that here. Maybe we can align this here. And then this is where the bartender is. That's exactly what I just did to the thing for barbeque. Don't worry. Oh, actually I don't know if I can use that combiner. Because it would make the floor look so different. Yeah, I'm sorry.        Sorry, I feel like I'm just gonna cut out the floor. Because this is such a low poly area. It wouldn't matter here. Just send them. Alright, I'll import them in a bit. So there will be tables here. Yeah, you have to make sure not to have too many data transfers. And polygons cause data transfers. There's not a strict limit I have in mind when I make that. But I am very afraid of putting too many polygons. But the cowboy level already has like 14.000 polygons right now. Although it's split over three areas. So the main one has like 10.000. And that's fine. Alright. Alright Zeina, I will give them a go in a bit. Once I am working on that part. Are you also doing the drybones animations? In the shambler I have one smaller room that's like 2.5k. Wow. But that's no problem because it's all rooms. Same as here. Doesn't matter. Oh, okay Zeina. Skel sounds good. Should this floor be the same as the floor on the bottom? Probably not. I feel like there should be a different texture.   Why are we talking about trout?  What is tout? Frozen caveman area or a restaurant area? I am not making a whole restaurant. Actually a whole restaurant level. I don't have many ideas for that. And french. Why do people do that? I don't know.  N something something. It will need to use the expansion pack. Okay, following plan. We are giving this one a texture. And then we are trying the combiner here. Or a combiner here. Unfortunately I can't use biomex combiner. It's not gonna work in this situation. Because I do want the multi textured floor. I'm gonna cry. But I'm gonna use the additive blending. It's gonna look sick. A whole restaurant. But what would be in a restaurant level? Would it be like a small restaurant? Would it be like a hotel? Hotel level? Would a hotel level be fun? But what are you gonna do for platforming in a hotel? Hello Piedra Richard. A manor. Like Nick Booth Hunt.  Cruises are just floating hotels. That's true. Okay. What? Bro just put together all the memes he knew. And formed a sentence out of it. Okay. I feel like that's not what a saloon looks like. And I know why. One second. This is solvable. We need support beams. That's what we need. We're gonna have support beams around here. We're gonna have support beams at the top. We're gonna have support beams down here. How do they look like? And these are gonna be floor tiles basically. Okay. Okay. Heh. Why is this not working? That's weird. But now it works. Okay. 62.5. Okay. Oh. This is more.  Okay. That looks good to me. The lore of this area is just cowboys. It's just a bunch of people being cowboys. No there are still Yoshi NPCs scattered throughout. Hello CXLinx. I feel like we have to overhaul the story of this game a little bit too. It's a good thing we barely even put a story in the game so far. The whole slavery plot is a little bit dark for a Mario game. Actually, we can just reuse this texture now. Yeah, I think I like this. I do not know the give me a drink bartender meme. Never heard of it. But generally, I do not reference memes. All right, let's give this a wall texture so Leela can stop complaining. Leela and Hoshi actually. Hello, Clayman. Welcome to the stream. What is a good wall? I'd like to be able to do the additive combining that Biobak likes to do now. Which is actually very easy to do in this context. My favorite color Yoshi. I do not have one. Never thought about it. Fun fact as a kid, I never had a favorite color. In fact, I feel like most kids do not have a favorite color. I feel like what happens is that someone asked them what their favorite color is and they just make something up and now that's the personality they're stuck with. How do you read this hot take? That's kind of how it happened to you. What am I saying, huh? Fucking called it. I'm going to make the take even hotter. That's also what happens with most people and their favorite sports club. Deciding your favorite Sonic also depends on your personality. Actually I don't think so. I think favorite Sonic, they're at least somewhat distinguishable because there's like, there's like 4 types of Sonic games. There's the good ones, Sonic Adventure 1 and 2. There's like the arguably decent ones, Sonic Heroes. There's the super edgy ones, Sonic the Hedgehog and then there's the dog shit ones. So you have to pick one of those. Sports club is usually inherited from parents. True, true. Wow, this texture looks terrible. Sonic Riders. Okay, that one just makes you hipsters. What if I just take this one and rotate it? Actually it happened to me too. Someone like my cousin asked me what my favorite football club is when I was a kid and I said I don't know any and then he told me just pick Bayern. Wait. Huh? Kanban was already flipped? Oh. Game is just whatever you enjoyed as a kid and the other game equals bad? No, I don't think so. The game I enjoyed the most as a kid is definitely like Sonic 2 and I know it's a terrible game. Makes sense, person. I didn't mean to doubt that you like the game. I was just like messing around. What the heck is the music on today? It's the Westworld OST. Hopefully it sounds like Cowboy. Oh yeah, I'm also releasing a video rating all my alt text next Saturday. Probably. If you all want to see that type of stuff. Yeah. I can't get a lot of them. Yeah. Yeah. Sonic Adventure 2, though, and Sonic Adventure 1. Man, those are good games. Why would the terminal sound music to be a cowboy? I don't know. It's Westworld OST. I didn't make it cowboy. Terminator sounding. Now, what was the texture for these? With which texture to my XPM? Dude, XPM is going to be so happy about this level because we're using his texture so much. This is a really good texture, though. Yeah. Are fuzzies going to appear in this game? Wait, which type of fuzzy are we talking about here? Because there's two different types of fuzzies. The trippy ones and the weird spiky ones. If you guys want a movie recommendation or a series recommendation. Westworld is actually a really good series. The first season. The second season is entirely unwatchable. No human being ever should be subjected to that. But the first one, holy shit, is good. Sure. That's such a weird thing, though. Why would the first season be good and then the second season is just so garbage? Crazy shit. What are the chances that you optimize the game so much that it actually runs 360 or 480p on extra hardware? Some games have already started using it with the expansion pack.  At least I think it's zero. I'm just not aiming for that. Do you have a brown teddy bear plush? Just saying. Nope. Case doesn't know what it's like to watch anime. That's why he asked that. Wait, what? What's anime have to do with this? What am I missing? I don't know. Anime starting okay and falling off is so common. They're trying to trick me into watching anime. It is startling. Fucked up Yoshi of the week. We got POV, you are a Yoshi. You're also going to apply support beams from the main floor to the overhanging floor, right? Yes. Actually, I'm going to make this a bit darker here. Oh, I kind of went off rhythm. Dude, what the fucking optical illusion is this? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Dude, stop going into vertex plane mode, please. There we go. Faster RAM and RDP. Am I supposed to hack the N64 itself? It's cheating. At that point, why are you even doing this? Just use Unreal Engine to make a game. Unless you have skill issues. Oh, that's nice. Oh, God, what is this copypasta about Coochie? I'm not reading that. Pigman carrying to the onion. Oh. Hello, Holly. So I need to project these windows into the world. So I'm thinking we're just going to move them up to here. And then do that. Is that a good enough projection? I feel like it would be bigger. So I'm going to make this bigger like so. I feel like that projects the window into the world pretty well. I'm going to delete this. No, I don't want to delete that, actually. Now that I think about it. I'm going to slide this along. OK. I'm going to slide this one along.  And then we're going to intersect these with the world geometry and UV map onto that. I don't think you would do that, Bellsmoke. Because even if you had my skills, you still wouldn't be wanting to spend thousands of hours on something you will not get paid for. OK. Hello, Hedgehog Gamer. All right. And now we can do the thing. This is what my idea was, Biobak. We do this and then use this as a decal and it will be additive combining. How do you back up your progress? Git. You fix the walls. Yippee. Where is this texture? Oh. Yippee brained I don't know I feel like I'm more like America maxed and parking lot pilled can you talk and we speak for the next 60 seconds I'll just be silent for 60 seconds so I don't have to do that wait there's an easier way to do this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 what's the best way to approach this I want this to be further in large what if I just delete that and duplicate this Gaussian blur 2 and I make this one completely black this didn't blur as I wanted the fuck why does this look so terrible hey this time it worked okay works for me wait actually this way around that's kitty behavior what's kitty behavior was I streaming on twitch last month damn has it been that long since I came back this is not how I wanted I need more of a gaussian blur I think maybe like that can I am and then we do take zero multiplied by shade and zero and then we said shade to something medium high oh it doesn't preview right okay we need to look at that in game and then we can do the additive stuff oh someone's yes my stream is very nice ASMR if you like keyboard sounds case can you speak with an American accent for the next 60 no stop asking me to do random things a dark alternative to New York with dinosaur people rule and there's fungus growing all over it that's a fucking wild idea I can't hate on that one but that's a little bit too out there can you get unmet from this front I don't know can you how should I know what points Lilaa did you put a song request this is your song request my McMansion okay guys if you want me to speak a certain way for the rest of the stream I'm gonna charge $200 for for $200 I will try and speak the stress of the stream like a cowboy okay it's doing something is it too much oh no this is just all the multiple ones all right let's try and make this additive so it looks good right now it looks bad ain't no way I do not know how to terminate a speaks if you were a good method actor you would do it for free true did I've been method acting cowboys already I don't think anyone can diss me here I was a cowboy for two whole weeks I know what it is to be a cowboy all right I've been a cowboy how do I do a transparent decals emote wait I don't actually know this faker I think you're the fake Hedgehog around here you're comparing yourself to me huh you're not even good enough to be my fake fuck how do you do transparent decal 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 what does what makes us a decal I don't actually oh wait still serve decal there we go CZ compare courage destination rep call on courage force blending Z mode decal Z mod decal okay is that it fuck it let's look at it in this case pretending that it's easy to fake him what I was quoting Sonic Adventure and said was saying it's easy it's difficult to fake him how do I do additive blending this makes no you're still a baby do what are we thinking of this one I actually feel like the dots are too small now and it's still not editing completely that looks better just saying yeah yeah the disadvantage with yours is that the floor is gonna be one cycle effectively but you know what I haven't even made it additive yet now it's additive now let's see it the lesson like you're side rolling for no reason maybe it's just me but quite honestly never really liked the way oh shit she got roasted look great hello thank you for the rate we're working on windows this is a cowboy level in Mario 64 we're making this is gonna be a saloon you like this one buy a bike I think this one's good now it actually looks additive wait where's the warp the fuck all right since a bunch of people just rated I will just show you real quick what we are working on we're making a Mario 64 sequel this all god fuck I can't show you because the warp is over here okay hold on for a few seconds I will show you the coolest thing you've ever seen on the n64 okay we're switching the OST everyone's talking about Radiohead I don't know who that is it's getting silly Zelda music Zelda music is music in cowboy music here no stream is not ending all right so this is a little cowboy tone we're making you should hear the music to get some tumbleweed this is gonna be a mole tunnel we got tumbleweeds we got sick music some dead trees a bunch of cowboys around some old grass this is not a finished cactus don't worry about that I know it looks bad barrels and the skeleton there and some sick color composition the color palette here is gorgeous true I like it a lot I've had people tell me case you need to follow the color we are more no I don't fuck the color it it's so arbitrary who decided that the color wheel was like the colors that go well together it makes no fucking sense it's just it grabbed out of the air with no reasoning someone just invented that I was like yep this is the truth it's not what's your setup here how are you getting this changes made a blender to show up in the Amita without explaining more whatever I'm exporting the model right here it's a blender plugin that allows me to export it directly into decomp we need a good fortnight butter barn OST all right let's do it fortnight and butter barn OST I don't know what that is case a year ago I love color theory I would never have said that no no no no no no never okay actually maybe I do like color theory but not the popular one fuck that one it makes no sense it's invented it's not deduced it's invented there I think that's the perfect wording for it it's fiction it's like you read Harry Potter and then tried to do spells and they didn't work that's kind of theory You said you love color science. That is what I would have said. Yes, that is what I would do I didn't lie. What do you mean? I was gaslit at worst I Science is theoretical you silly goose Yes, but the association is completely different. That's a calling Harry Potter magic theory Is not it's just made up Just like popular color theory is just made up I'm gonna come down to the bottom burn Look at how hideous this plush is. I find it's only two thousand three hundred dollars Can I clear a music theory throw them both out You Learned it while you use it. If you don't use it like language, you don't read without reading now I Imagine dragons playing. No, we're not doing this. All right, let's do Zelda Wild West OST or music rather Well just music Oh, well, whatever happens happens Okay, this is okay this is gonna be another one of those Pixel art moments, but I Don't like music theory cuz Why the fuck is it 12 notes I Get it. I get that the ratios when you have a 12 tone scale Kinda line up nicely with actual ratios, but why the fuck can't we use the actual ratios? That would be so much better Why are we limiting music so much Don't like it I Didn't like it so much that I just refused to get into music And like dude Holly we already had this argument and I feel like you literally just don't get me So I feel like there's no point in explaining this to you again We Actually use the actual ratio, but no you don't that's the thing He's a bad boy nobody will ever understand them now a few people understand them Why They're only 0 1s and 0s why we're limiting computers, but that's what to be That's half a charge makes sense. No, it doesn't In music it's different And I know this because what I've done is I have Made a chord with the actual perfect harmonies and I've shown this to musicians and they all agreed that sounded nicer in Isolation to one chord, of course working with all Different Frequencies would be very hard and painful and I get them it's difficult, but I want to be able to do it I Mean I guess there's macro tunnels, but that's not what I'm looking for at all either I'm saying I want non-quantized notes It will literally be impossible to have names for that. Did you know? This is a fucked-up thing, but did you know? That it is impossible to name every number Because the amount of names we can make is countably infinite, but the amount of numbers uncountably infinite This means you cannot possibly Mathematically provable. You cannot possibly have a name for everything. I just mentioned it is not possible You Can't mention it. Yes, you know Talking but What about pigs that I didn't talk about her? About pics art. I say that it doesn't make any sense to me because there's no Strict definition it blurs into normal art pretty quickly You Can have infinitely long name yes, but it's gonna be countably infinite not in countably infinite Can every number Japanese actually they have an infinite naming system for numbers it doesn't matter There is uncountably infinite things, okay think about this Let's say you can make a name as long as you want and you can Let's even say you have an infinite amount of words But if it's still countably infinite, you can't recreate it uncountably infinite numbers And doesn't if you read the definition What is the definition We're doing this again It would be in kind of well But that's still countable like the natural numbers are also countably infinite because you can assign a natural number to everything Think about this Let's say you take every word in the language and you give them a number from one to like the amount of words in the language and now the word you just created it's just The first words number multiplied by the number of words in the language and Then the second words number multiplied by the amount of words on the language squared Now you have assigned a number to The word you just generated Which means this way we can enumerate all possible words you can make in this language, which means it is countably infinite Here we'll do a simple math When it's over it's told to  -, what I just said is the closest you'll get to it Yes, but it's still gonna be countably infinite once You can also assign a number to every number Yes, there's countably infinite natural numbers, but there's not countably infinite rational numbers like you can't assign a number to pi Countably infinite is a math term. I feel like if you're not a mathematician then whatever I just said just sounds like schizophrenic rambling Exactly, you're just gonna have to trust me That level seems bigger than you could even expect It's not that big I think, like most of what you're saying I'll admit a lot of what I say sounds really weird but sometimes I say something and you get it and it just hits you right and you agree with it and that's the moment that I'm waiting for Maybe 90% of what I say sounds like insane rambling but then 10% it's like holy shit he said the exact thing I was thinking that I could never get anyone else to see the same way And that makes it worth it You can write basically an infinite amount of music with 12 notes. I don't think it's a limitation. Of course you can write an infinite amount but you cannot write every music with it Hello Tiberius, yes we all missed you Yeah but I am. I wanna do it. I'm a numbers guy You need a very high IQ to understand. You need a very high IQ to not go insane watching Case Emanuel A fretless guitar and learn how to play it? I think that's how you play them. No, I wanna input them on a computer and make music And I write down the numbers I wanna be like give me a 200 Hz, 250 Hz, 300 Hz chord He's saying difficult programming things to me. I don't really know what he's saying in this room. Oh, I get it Is there shooting due on this course? Kinda. There's gonna be bad rumors with cork guns that are gonna try and cork you Alright, I think we're ready to add some tables to this. By multiples of 50. And not multiples of 50, just multiples of the bass note Alright, so it will be 1.25 times the bass note and 1.5 times the bass note, which is gonna sound nice They cork you with their cork gun My brain runs on 1 Hz thoughts. No, no thoughts at that point Now, what do the tables look like? These are kinda nice tables Can you see me down the mark searching? It's hardly turned down a lot from the last time you saw another video, I think But Sylar said he wanted to make a new function for that So I'm waiting for that. I'm not working on it right now I mean, it's just frequencies and timing though. There's a lot of expression that doesn't seem to be in the notation too Like volume I mean, I'm not arguing against having more stuff to denote stuff. I just don't like that instead of You know, a continuous spectrum of frequencies, we have a distinct spectrum of Notes Do you go to refs a lot when making lesson plan notes too? No I kinda just made stuff up Music and naming What if you want to play the note that is 25% of the way between C and C sharp though? So hold on It's lucky. No, I actually hadn't thought about that at all. Maybe I should have looked at lucky look Just pitch bend the note That seems very inconvenient C.25. What's the frequency number? Do I have to compute that every time? I don't want to make music like that I don't know about that I feel like it'd be convenient to me Yeah, I get that, Ox. I know why it's the way it is I just don't want it to be that way if I'm gonna make music I don't know I don't want to do an instrument I have zero interest in instruments at all I would just want to make a song Like on a computer And even then on the instrument you're still limited by how many buttons there are Bits? Thank you for the 10 bits Hello Thank you for the bits You should sing us a song Chippy Chippy Chapa Chapa Dubi Dubi Luba Luba Yeah, but I want a continuous spectrum, Ox. I don't want microtones Just put the notes on the piano and we're all done And it's notes, it's not frequencies That's the whole point That's my whole issue I want frequencies I feel like it'd be convenient to me I feel like in a few years, sometime in the future We will have, maybe we will be making music Off of frequencies You should name your files Deutschland über Buber? What does that mean? Write a synthesizer encode? That honestly might be my best option Drink water? Fine Yeah, I've seen a Tyramine That seems like a one thing with a continuous note spectrum Well I agree it's gonna be a lot harder, Ox Just because the 12 tone thing is very close To having good relations between notes They just so happen to mostly line up Although I do wonder if there's gonna be like a 13 or 14 Or maybe even an 11 thing where they line up better Yeah, I feel like maybe The crossover between math skill And music skill that you need to actually write with frequencies Is gonna be huge, so I feel like that's not something Musicians would ever want But like imagine if we had some Da Vinci But instead of picking up notes We would be painting With music and math. I feel like a person like that would be able to pull it off. Da Vinci! The song is nice. Don't call him the stinky, that was rude. So that just ended. I don't know. Maybe... Oh, there's a tracklist. Rigor Mortis Rack, Death Road to Canada. Okay. That's not what the song sounded like at all. Definitely did not get Death Road to Canada vibes from it. Zelda, again, I want nothing to do with a real instrument. I have zero interest in that. Yeah, I don't know why it has such a weird metal Death Road to Canada, Kill Death 5000 name anyway. Did not seem like that name belongs to that song. Hmm, I kind of like the texture, I kind of like this, but the middle looks bad. I don't want to use this one again. I feel like maybe I just need something what I have as an outline with a normal tree bark thing instead. That might work better, or, oh, I kind of like this. I think this one might be decent. Ooh, banana. Stream is not down now. Not for me. I hope not. Is my stream down? Is Hoshi down? Okay. I don't think it's down. I think I'm being gaslighted. It's still on? Okay. Hoshi is just gaslighting me. Yeah, it might just be the Twitch stream that's down. It is what it is. Unlucky. Hidden hamster genes, what? I would never chew on a cable. Oh, fuck. I feel like if anyone chewed at the cable, then it was at Twitch and not at KSs. Boss of this level, well, first of all, not every level has a boss, but this level has a bunch of outboss that you have to catch. So while there isn't one boss, there's going to be multiple small fights you're going to engaging with. Dude, okay, funny story. So sometimes I refer to women as females, right? And someone told me, KS, when you do that, that sounds weird. It sounds like you're treating women as lesser. And then they looked up at how many times I did that. And they looked up how many times I said males instead of men. And it turns out that I just refer to men as males and women as females, like almost all the time. And I did it more to men. So you cannot blame me for being sexist here. But the reason I like doing that is because it kind of underscores that humans are still animals when you call them females and males. It's um, I just like it. Puts humans from the pedestal down to the world. Do you go to the zoo and say hi, grandpa? Yes. If I am there with my grandpa, I do that. If my grandpa is not there, I do not greet him. Atheist when Charles Devon and Rose Dunn chimed in and said it was true. Hi, male case. Thank you, Lila. I didn't realize there was going to be a religious argument that humans are also animals. That's interesting. That's interesting. Charles Devon has a Twitter. What's he saying on there? Well, that's kind of very boring to look at. But it still sounds creepy like insults. Yeah, but if I am also doing that to men. But yes, that's how I even found out about that. Someone said, case, you're sounding like an insult when you call women females. And that was so confusing. How? How can this be? Although I will say in high school, I had an autistic friend who would refer to women as weibchen. Which in German, that's the word for female. But it sounds so much weirder. That's usually exclusively how you would refer to animals. That's like calling them femoids or something. I don't know why he did it. But he was like, yeah, he was not like Asperger autistic. He was like, like needing a guy to come to school with him autistic, you know. He might have just not realized that's a weird language or he did it on purpose. He has to be on his own. Oh, I see. I don't know, I feel like there's still a big distinction between Asperger's and like the other type of autism where it's so much more severe. You should have been working on a night. Yeah, that would have been fun. Unfortunately, I was not even born at that point. So there is that. I think they should be taller. Oh, they're literally in the floor. Oh no wonder. Are these on the floor too? No. Yeah, the spectrum is too big to, you know, just have one name and have it adequately explain that person's personality. What the fuck? There we go. So I was just having a touch of autism. That's the only way to put it. I don't know. I don't want to say anything offensive here. I feel like some people are going to tie their identity to that label. And if you say that there's a distinction, they might get mad at you. I think this works now as the tables, although the colors in here are pretty samey. Although we have the window effect down. But yeah, now we still need to add the secret door. I'm not sure what a secret door should be. Under the bar. It's got to be like just a knob in the wall. I hate this for a song request. All right. All right. The title already seems good. There's no fireplace. I mean, under the stairs seems like a very obvious spot. I think that's probably it. I don't know if it makes you any of that. I feel like it just makes it more apparent if you are any of that to begin with. I heard that with autism, the intelligence distributions like flatter. As in there are some more really intelligible ones and also more stupid ones. But I don't know if that's true. That's just what I had heard once. Do not take this as fact. This is just me saying I heard this shit once and I don't know if it's true. Wait. Okay. I thought this was going to be a mashup, but it's just. It's just a video. Okay. Okay. I don't know if that's true. That seems like speculation to me. I haven't heard of that one before. Okay. I think we've made good progress for today. The saloon is mostly finished designing. We just need to actually make it look good. Now it's very, very samey looking. And we got cool windows. Yeah. Next, we need to add the door, but that's going to be it for today. And I'll see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye.
