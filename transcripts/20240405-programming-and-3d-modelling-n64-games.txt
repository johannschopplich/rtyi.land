Finally touched its home The curing process started immediately. In fact, the growth was so immense that from that moment on he was known as the three-leg Hello I Love better hello CX links. I know what the hell it is a bonus stream because I'm off work for this week I Was working on the bandits just now We got a sub Thank you for the sub I Gotta turn this down a little bit Never mind, what should I not mind about? Meowty partner. Hello sicko I'm gonna set myself. I asked if I couldn't be a mod. Oh, oh That's what that was I thought I heard a voice I Streaming today. I have a week of work and I decided to just do a bonus stream Hello Aaron hello tea time I    Do bullets in his teeth look fucked up why what's wrong with them?  Think so. Here we can choose the because we selected all of them    a friendly guy better. He just wants to give you a hug. Let's get off. The teeth should be almost metallic. I mean, yeah, I know. I see what you mean, but it is good the way it is. Let me just fix both versions of him real quick. Mario and Luigi dream team. Let's do it. And to deal with small Earthquake earlier, holy shit. He's parched. What does parched mean? You think you'll one step closer to struggle to marry you? How many steps are there in your plan in total? Before I can tell you whether you're right or not. Parched means super thirsty. Oh, I'm parched. 7 million. Okay, well, one step closer seems pretty reasonable then. Yeah, I think if your plan is 7 billion steps, you generally are one step closer. There we go. Oh yeah, I haven't shown you guys what I did with the trains yet, did I? Hello Ganondorf. We did some really cool effects here. They now have VFX, they have SFX, they have the camera shake and they do that to you. It's fine Lilaa, we don't want the exact Mario 64 look. It still looks very Mario 64. I don't think the ones in Mario 64 go for the metallic look actually. I'll get this clickbait thumbnail. There's clearly a shadow here. Oh my god, this looks so terrible. What even is this? What is this supposed to be? But look, it's like this. It's random chain jumps for an example. Yes, but like what even was that on his teeth? Ganondorf's uncanny? No, I like him. I disagree. I think he looks very canny. For instance, listen to the next soundtracks on Badem Soundcloud. It's freaking amazing like how different from the default Mario 64 sound. Most of it is still the default Mario 64 sound font. I would guess like 70% of the instruments, but they're used in really creative ways. So it sounds like a completely new soundtrack with like a similar vibe to me. That's what I want anyway. Tumbleweed salesman. He should be upset that there's a guy running around with his tumbleweeds. I didn't tell you guys this. There's like a head store here and there's a tumbleweed store here and there's two bandits and they're going to run around and the sellers are like, oh, he stole all my stuff. And this is a trick we do so we don't actually have to 3D model the stuff here because we are getting pretty close to running out of RAM. Although maybe we do fill it out with some stuff. I don't know. I would not know yet. And a bandit came by and stole them. Oh, shit. You are Twitch again. I just realized I'm going to wait. Does that mean you're back? So I'm Italian and so excited for it to work as a solid color and then not receive an even worse address myself. Why, Biobak? Why? Why would you do this to us? I wonder what even is the texture here. Because they're not receiving lighting is kind of an issue. Oh, it is the same texture. Wait, it does receive lighting. Wait, it doesn't. What the hell? Oh, this doesn't receive lighting either. Oh. Oh, I see. There is three Yoshi coins in this course now, and so it does actually not receive lighting like the whole thing. And that is a tiny bit of an issue, I would say. But we can fix this pretty easily. What have I just? The Alpha is just white. So what if we remove this, turn this into Alpha? Make the shade color multiplied by shade color Alpha. How is that, Lilaa? Did you turn music donations off? No, they're still there. Oh, but that ruins the middle part. I see. How is this, Lilaa? Will you stop crying if I let's try him real quick. What the fuck? What is this error? He tried to donate and it didn't play. Let me check Streamlabs. Actually, this might be PayPal actually just having closed my donations because I had some issues with PayPal recently again. Nope, it doesn't show up at all. Sure, I won't report this issue. It will seem to suck major ass. Yep. They asked me to verify my identity three months ago and I did and they said it will take two days and they still haven't verified it and now they just closed my account basically. That's a TLDR. Oh, Sierra again. White drop collection index range. Send him the turnout output. This one. Good call. Did you use the limit that I have to donate to play music? It was always $1, I think. Ayo, this ain't Saturday. Yep, it's a bonus stream. He tried again and nothing happened. Let me check my email to see if I got any donations. Oh, wait, do they go to the wrong email address? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where do my Twitch donations go to? How are you donating here? My Twitch donations might be set up wrong. Wait, let me fix this. Great. How is this going to the wrong email address? Give money to Casey Emanuel. Yeah, that's my old email address. Casey Emanuel and gmail.com. It's associated with my German PayPal account, but because of taxes, I needed to make a Canadian one. So now I'm just kinda fucked. My old PayPal address is not connected. How is it just sending it to the wrong email address? This makes no sense. You also don't show up in my tips here. Wait. Streamnets.com. This makes no sense. It just goes to the wrong email address. Yeah, I don't know what to do about this right now. I'm not remaking it, I'm just trying to fix part of it. Let me actually look at the system console here. Is it because it's trying to read the wrong layer of information here? What if I do that? Oh, if I remove the color layer, it works. Is it saying something about safety from the crazy bus theme? Yep, I guess so. Let's see if it made this any better. Well, he's definitely multiplied with the yellow now. Most of him anyway. It doesn't look like his mouth is multiplied with the yellow. Why is his mouth looking so bad? His mouth looks like it's glowing. Do you even mind the theme for the next level? I'm not 100% yet. I also need to stretch my bicep because of strength training. I was stuck at trying to strengthen and get past 60 lbs when now I'm up to 85. Nice, nice. That's good. Why is this glowing? It looks good. No, we're not doing that. I'm just going to multiply this with a little bit of blue. No, just use lighting and leave it be. What? What do you mean just use lighting and leave it be? It looks terrible. Why do you want it to look like this? How about a music theme? I don't want to do a music theme. Music theme kind of sucks. It's already been done. So, oh shit. There's a bunch of stuff open here that shouldn't be. Oh, it's just my PSN card. He's still very much going for this. Lila, what does that have to do with just leaving it glowing radioactive? Huh? Why do you want to do that? I don't understand your motive here. It's weird you want it to be weird? Are you trying to sabotage me? Hello, Rionu. Rare to see you here. Yeah, this looks way better to me now. Way better than the glowing. Yeah, I'm still using 1.6. I do read the YouTube chat, Rionu. I just missed that message. I read both. Oh, you sent the chump off the chains. I was just busy talking to Lilaa with her panic attack then. I kind of missed the message. Oh, let me check the text of the little goomba here. Oh, we didn't add him yet. Cool. I gotta ask Zeina to make a tumbleweed store here. Lilaa and her panic attack. That's an eventful day for you. That's every day for me. Yes, you can fix the ace back in 1.6, but I simply do not give a shit. It does not matter. I don't play anyone's hex anyway. I don't want to learn how to compile 1.6. It's gonna take forever. So okay, what's else on the list? We did the bandits. We have the tumbleweed guy. We need to finish a sign here. We need a sign for the Koopa bank here. Let me add that as well. Tumbleweed store, Koopa bank. Hello Hoshi. Yep, it's a bonus stream today. Will they just be visual or will they give you a card or something? The tumbleweeds are purely visual. Pokis. Okay, so we have the cowboy Yoshis, we have the Pokis, we have the cowboy toad sheriff. I had one idea for a shifty guy that's just moving whenever Maru isn't looking at him. I want to make a Yoshi coin with him somehow. I want one guy to be at the hat store here talking about how the hats are always sold out. I want one guy at the train station here and I want one guy at the tumbleweed store complaining about how they're always sold out. And not this year, Rionu. That's not going to happen. What I just did at the exchange, I don't know. If one exciting don't feed the pet, there's this guy here. He's really funny. Yeah, we're almost done with first of all, Rionu, but after that, it's still like three Okay, let's do the guy at the train station. I think I want him to be a shy guy. I don't know that, Chris. I don't know the law. I'm just a dude that makes Mario games. Not a lawyer. So this guy should complain about being unable to hop on the trains because they just race by him or something. I think that would be funny. I don't know, it's not very funny or creative, but it is what it is for now. But no, and then that Chris asked something, not Rionu. What's cool slicing is under the pretense that you're using the adjective entirely or substitute a portion of it. I don't understand. Oh, he's asking about how much of my part of the engine I can use minty, right? Like the graph render codes. Is that my own code or is it still Nintendo's codes? That's kind of like an arbitrary line at some point, right? It's the ship of the size meme. I'll show you guys to jump NPC here. He's very funny. This is the change from sauna. He says, howdy partner, your mother went to step around here. My critters as friendly as they come, but bless aside, he ain't got no sense of his own weakness. He starts playing a bit too rough on the are you're liable to end up with more than just a scratch here, here. I think that's very fitting. But I'm trying to make this that will look a little more alive because right now it feels like there isn't too many NPCs here. Yeah, exactly minty. This is indeed difficult to catch a train. I guess that's kind of a nice hint that you're not supposed to jump on the train, but rather that they're obstacles. The train was fixed. Oh, you guys, I never showed you guys that's that I look at the train wheels. Isn't that cool? At some point. Oh yeah, we do need to add a lot of coins to this level. Is Clapton going to be in this level if it's really well, maybe at the hat store? I wasn't planning on it, but he would kind of fit into this area here next to it. We do have to do Pokies next, I think, or at some point. Like right here, Clapton would fit really well. I was watching a speedrunner today and they couldn't do speedkicks. I can't believe this generation. Did you add more translation support to armatures? No, this is actually just me cheating, but it works. There's supposed to be translation support in armatures, but Lilaa. But Lilaa. How does it work? You can represent any translation as a combination of two rotations. Right, that's how quaternions work, right? Or well, that's how matrices work. Instead of like matrices, sure, they look like you're doing translation, but really you're just rotating around the fourth dimension, right? If you think about it. Oh no, Hoshi, I will hack myself. What will I do now? Well, let's do a Pokies. So what kind of Pokie do we want? We definitely do not want to use the original one. Oh God, this is an interesting look. We can add this to the second area, which has a lot of performance left over, so it doesn't matter. Bing and Bing is starting to backfire, isn't it? It's just annoying, people ask me. No, we cannot, Hoshi, you're getting baited by chat. They're making things up. Actually let me add coins first. I will add coins. Lilaa had a good idea here. That will make this level look a lot more alive really, really quickly. Can you also make a Pokie model for the Bowser's amusement park level? You're right. You are right. I will just reuse that one. Very very good point. How did you remember that and I didn't? What the hell? That would be a really cool design, Minty, but it's going to be hard to make it look good, I think. Wait. Why is there a white outline on this? It's kind of terrible. Well, I guess we can just use this Pokie here. What do you think of the Dying Ascension accompaniment, isn't it super weird? You know, it's actually, the funny, okay, actually, I'm kind of fine with it, but only because it means I was more right than I thought I would be, because when I sat, when I saw the comp, I said, yes, but they're going to extend the deadline anyway, even though they say they won't and they will allow late submissions, even though they say they won't and the hack that goes 30 minutes will win, even though they say they want a 10 minute hack because we all know that what they say doesn't matter. I've always said the comps, you don't win it by making good hacks. You win it by playing to the audience and stuff like that. Yeah, an hour before it ends really is more terrible than I thought it would be. I think we have every right to be cynical about this. Oops. Where are the object combos? Oh no, no, no, no. I can't open this on stream. Nope. We're not opening Visual Studio. One second. I did not think that would open Visual Studio. Cool.  I didn't leak anything. I guess I just have to guess the bperms. Actually I can just look up what the bperms are. Sorry about that, because I stayed up until 4.30am to submit unnecessarily. Holy shit. That's extra bad for you. I don't think even if I had let Visual Studio be opened, I would have broken NBA because I opened like a random JSON file in it, but I didn't want to risk it. Hello Squealin. Poki that's trying to camouflage. It's already kind of camouflaging by having the same color. A stream on the day of the fry? Yep, it's a bonus stream because I got a week off work and I felt like it. Okay, that should work then if it's just bperm1721. You're still salty. That's fair. See, now the thing is the worse your time management, the better your hack is going to be up to a certain degree. That sucks, right? Oh, I'm your calendar Skyloft, dang. I'm to Skyloft when a rooster is to a medieval peasant, except I tell the Saturday. Okay, that works. Gonna ask Zeno to make animations for this guy here. I haven't really shown you guys how it works. Basically he has a spline and he just follows the spline, but he can also turn around on the spline and then go the other way. Like if I go here, he's going to be like, well, okay, nevermind. He walked into me, but let's show him. Let me show you on the other one. We have the mic turned on, by the way, I didn't have to cut anything, but I could have achieved the same result that I stressed and had been announced in advance. Yeah. For me, it's like, I think it's a little shady because you are committing to a four-week project, but then the deadline extends by two weeks. Now your choice is like, okay, either I put in an additional two weeks of work to try and get a better placement, or I accept that I submitted a four-week project to a six-week competition. Right. And at that point you're already like committed. It's like you altering the deal after you've made the deal, you know, like what Unity did where they were like, yeah, we want like 1% of your sales now up to 10%. It kind of feels like that to me. Oh, what the fuck? Why did Bro drop so many of these? I see why. We need this. Infinite money glitch, true. I could fail my capstone class, even though my professor said my project is one of the best he's seen. It's only being sent to a presentation where he's just like making a bad presentation. That would stink. Second presenting, that's fair. I also did not do well in presentations in Uni, but I also did not care. It was actually bizarre. My presentation in Uni for a project, I forgot I had it, but it was like a group project. So the other three just did it. And like they emailed me, but it was to my university email, which I didn't check. It still passed though, but like I did nothing. They must have been so upset at me. Maybe he's salty you made a good game without his teaching being required. Think about it. Who would go to a school to teach game design? It would have to be someone who wasn't as successful as a game designer, right? Because if they had been successful as a game designer and they liked game design, they would be a game designer. Is that offensive? Does that not apply to every teaching position? No, if you look at stuff like math class or like German classes, English classes, it's usually people that generally want to teach, right? They specifically study teaching and they teach at schools. Teaching at school and teaching at the university are two completely different things, I think. When I was in uni, one of my teachers had the scores of the question wrong, so I had up to 4 out of 10 that I was able to point it out to him. And she hid the exam away from me and refused to teach the scores, so I had to complain to the university that the score had changed and they sent me supersonic, which I never applied to, fun times. Get a lot of features. People with an ego that just are undeserving of that ego are the worst. Nice. I actually didn't have any issues with university teachers. There was one teacher who was super hard on the students, but he was my favorite teacher. He'd be like, yeah, you better be able to recite this proof from... Actually, no, not recite this proof. I want you to be able to derive this proof from memory. And I liked that. He was actually pushing people. The closest I got to being in trouble with a teacher was... We had a programming class and I did 90% of the group project. We did this at uni, I did 90% of the project and I said, well, my train's coming, but you guys can finish this up in five minutes, I'm going to leave out early. And then the teacher was like, you just left your group without them. They couldn't finish it because you left. I'm going to give you a bad grade and everyone else gets a good grade. And then, okay, well, whatever. Do not care. And I didn't even speak to the teacher, but she just changed my grade afterwards to like full grade. And I don't know why. Hello, Ruth. It is going well. Let me make sure this doesn't crash because of our memory constraints. And then we start programming the Poki. What's a capstone? That sounds like an item in like Xenoblade or something. Are we actually this much out of RAM that we can't even add the OpenGL layout? It's truly close to 64 megabytes. I'm around 49 right now. Yes, a lot of it is due to placeholder songs. If you look at my ROM size right now, it actually says, what does it say? 62.7. But that's because there's like 15 minutes of code. Slumps in here that aren't actually part of the game. Oh, I see. Yeah, we're actually this much out of RAM. That is insane, actually. When we were having RAM issues, that's just this level here. It's because in D-Comp, it's so hard to just have data per area, you know? The police should say pokey dokey at some point. Do you think he should be speaking at all? Be honest. That would be really funny to follow, but if you're actually out of RAM, we're gonna have to make budget cuts. We're definitely gonna have to cut to Yoshi Ranch, which is sad, but it is what it is. Let me actually slap an ignore render on here and see if we can now enter the level. Honestly, I'm fine with cutting out the Yoshi Ranch. I think that was unnecessary fluff anyway. Can you link to new engine RAMs by moving between them? Yes, in ROM Manager, this is super easy to do, but in D-Comp, there's a lot of stupid C things you need to do that I don't know what to do right now. Yeah, just removing the area fixes it. We are out of memory. Cool, cool, cool. I mean, that makes sense. This level is 40,000 triangles. So I'm not too upset at that. All right, let's cut the Yoshi Ranch then, I guess. Pokey Pokey Literature Club. I have edited a new video this week. It was my main project this week. And I have a Dan Salvato quote in it. So you will get your Pokey Pokey Literature Club. It's a really bad quote, though. I'm gonna hate it. I'm thinking instead of this, we're just gonna make a wall here and then this is all just walled off. Maybe we just have to shed here, just like this part. Also, I'm very surprised we actually ran into RAM issues. I did not expect that to happen. I thought RAM on the N64 was infinite. Updated on Remake. It's going well, but I promise very soon, probably because of ADHD or some shit, but it's looking good. And also you're gonna hate me because I think it's gonna do a wave with the node-based lightning. Okay. You don't even want to use it as a base layer. You could just apply it into the lightning layer and then we added the lightning layer if you want. Yeah, this is Mario Luigi OST. Okay, that's fine. I'm not that keen on the manual on the automatic thing anyway. For me, it's just I have it there because it's so easy to just get a good feel for how it's gonna look. And it lets you experiment with the lighting so quickly. Shit, just the sound of this level sounds a bit weird to have a point source. Yeah, kind of. Yeah, I can kind of see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, fair. Oh, that's what it is. Okay, we're just gonna move the shed like here. Make a level a little bit smaller here. I think it was really fun. Just the stick controls weren't broken. So sad. Yeah. I take no complaints for this one. I wasn't working at years when that happened. They were still working on an update to the game. Will you harass them into fixing the stick controls? Yes. Well, I will try not to harass them, but I will let them know that something's wrong with the stick controls. I mean, I already did. They probably will fix it. Although they only published it, right? So they didn't actually have that much of a direct influence on it, I think. I wouldn't actually know. Damn Deimos. Did you learn German just to become a simp? Why is that the only one you know? How many stars are you going to have in this level? 6 stars, 5 Yoshi coins for a total of 7. So good starting sentence to get awkward with German strangers. True. Is it true that you're not supposed to look people in the eye? At least it's like here in Germany. Because in Germany, when you talk to people, you're supposed to look them into the eyes. You're supposed to just fucking stand up down, basically. But I've heard people say that's weird. Yeah, Vasa, you can use Parallel Launcher or Rolls-Royce, Mupen, GUI or just Mupen or Simple64 or whatever. Know your German colors? Do you think I know German colors? Think about it. Oh, oh, right. I didn't fix the collision map. It looks like it loads though. So that's good. That wasn't a question for you. Do you guys understand country flags? Because they don't. They just seem random. What do they actually have to do with the country? Red is the blood of the soldiers that died in combat. That actually kind of makes sense. Did you just make that up or is that real? It's like when an explanation makes that much sense, it's usually made up, right? Oh, the whole house is here still. Hello, Arthur. Who are you calling Gaze? Arthritis Willy. Can explain. That's not a name I made up for him and someone else called him Arthritis Willy. I would never be so childish to call him Arthritis Willy. Conjecture, I see. Yeah, okay. We might as well just make a new is this is fucked up. You know what? At least I'm being honest. I'm glad you like this stuff. Yeah, so I need to save a bit of memory in this level. I'll need to think about something. What were the colors? Oh, the colors on the window logo. Weren't they just like red, green, blue, yellow? Oh, the four nations, the four nations, Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft. Sure. Fuck. Why would it crash? That's actually genuinely a bizarre crash. I don't understand. I guess we can reduce the try count a little bit, but I just can't imagine that that crash just there was from try count. Is it's less than in the main area. Oh, wait, this dry bones here. And this dry bones here. There was an issue. The dry bones were no longer above legal floor. And that's why. What's with the bratwurst speak on my twitch TV? He read the German article. No, I wasn't planning on a day night cycle. What did I think about P vs. NP? Explain what the problem is and I'll tell you what I'm thinking about. Right, but just because it's unsolved doesn't mean that I'm not going to have an opinion on it. I have very strong opinions about the randomest things. Okay. When I hear a very strong, very random opinion, I'll give you one right now. I'll prove myself. You can check that something is true. Always takes the same amount of time as getting the solution. It's about if you can check that something is true. That's not a full sentence. Wait, I don't know what that means. Is it is the question whether it always is possible to determine the answer to a question in the same time that it takes to figure out whether there is an answer to the question? Is it something like that? Yeah, well, this works now. Let's look over the level and see if we can budget cut the triangle somewhere so we have less memory usage. I'm actually glad we cut the last area here because that would be even more of an issue. Had we not cut the last area. So that's good. I don't think we need this one here. We can just hit the player into an invisible wall. We also don't need this or this. Actually, those things were probably actively harmful. Speaking from a collision perspective. I'm not going to be able to remake this thing. No, it's just a memory thing and you'll be fine. I'm pretty sure. Don't worry about it too much. There's a lot of memory I can still free. It's mostly gonna mean for me, like, I need to start making the collision map already before I fully finish the level. I should start clipping the result parts into one of the grounds. Where was that? I've sent one of the dry bones, like here. Oh, this? That would indeed need to be fixed. When you pass one of the other keepers, for a combination of keepers, stun bot merge a specific location and a given ghost could save a lot of time avoiding running. I could just change where the warp goes, but just doing that probably takes longer than just walking there for the time being. Right, we also have the vertices below these here that can probably just go in the collision map. Right, so that was, like, 400 collision triangles. That's gonna be almost enough space for, like, a full texture. It is better than nothing. Shit, I just realized there's supposed to be train tracks here. Oh, that's gonna need so much more memory again. We're in trouble, guys. We might need to be able to load data per area here. Let me see what else there is here that maybe can be removed. I don't think we need the effect bank. We could theoretically also remove the command bank here. Yeah, there's still many options available to us. I wish we had data per area, though. Dang. Why is it just this one level that's so expensive? What makes this level so much more expensive than the other ones? Hello, Michi. Right, so I just realized another thing that we can save a lot of memory on. I don't think we need this much here. We have data per area. Maybe. I mean, it'd be easier to only have certain actors per area instead of programming the whole game to be, like, data per area. You know what? We have a memory overlay. Let's try that. Let's see what it says. That's so much free data. Wait, how are we running into issues? 0 and F for 0. And now... It should be reduced when I go away from the chomp. Let me try that again. Oh, I see.  Hello, Jan. 4, 1, F, F, 0. Well, this is a shit ton of space. This is like a quarter of a megabyte. That's 66 textures worth of space. How do we run out? Wait, you see this node? 1, 5, 3, 4, 0. And serve 5, 1, 8, 0. Hmm. Let me see something here. Nope, they're both slightly above. Interesting. I don't think the Minecraft and Minecraft executes works anymore. Dangerous game you're playing. If we have this much free memory, how can it be that we crashed before? Does it not factor in the surface nodes? I can't imagine that. What if I go somewhere with a dynamic object? Will it change? Wait, no, they are already allocated. It shouldn't change. Hmm. Hello, Asko. Okay, well, if you have this much free space, let's just ignore whatever happens and keep going. There must be a bug somewhere then. It's likely the Goddard star. Hmm. Never understand the word I'm saying. It's fascinating. I do say a lot of words. Okay, what does the Pokédex do in our game? Is it just gonna be a power? That wobbles back and forth. Hmm. We're not adding status effects. Oh yeah, it's like 8pm for real now. That's a little late to be drilling walls. I'm going towards Mario. Why don't we just use the vanilla Pokébehavior here? I also should add more coins. I forgot about that. Let me add coins and then we do the Poké. Can I assign a designer concept for it? Yeah, I think we're just gonna use the vanilla Pokébehavior. Like, why wouldn't we? Hmm. Hello, Aurasphere. Isn't the vanilla Pokébehavior basically perfect here? Hmm. Oh, it's just gonna be a random enemy we just slap on there. There isn't much deep design to it. We should, however, have coins on the track here to encourage the player to explore this. Yeah, drop money on the train tracks. That's a waste choice. Let me just make sure it's not too many coins, because too many coins could crash the game too here. What is the program with Ubuntu's logo? That's my compiler. Ah. You had an earthquake too. I guess you live somewhere next to Skyloft. Oh, there's also the dry bone animation that I can still remove. And real-time clock. How does that help? The empties actually get exported in-engine. See, they're right there now. The Blender script exports them. Oh no, I accidentally gave them the object layout. They're all gonna be snifits now. And there's an invisible coin in there. Let's remove those. That's the one I removed, the invisible coin here. Let's see if this is better. Let's crash the game on April 1st. God, my body feels so fucked up today. I feel like I haven't been able to recover from my bench in a while. I feel like because I increased the weight so much, I need to take more rest days. Leaving even one impossible coin will cause a swanky box video to be made. That's rude. Do you think this game will be relevant enough for a bunch of stupid swanky box theories? You know what swanky box theories? Sorry. We have to- What if- Do you guys know that Hello Neighbor game that just kept pinging MatPat? I was like, I wonder if MatPat will show up. What if I do that, but I do that with like swanky box, Nathaniel Bandy, Tetra Bin Gaming, SimpleFlips. Like I'm just- Oh, I wonder if SimpleFlips will make a theory video about this one. I just start doing that. That would be funny. I max bench. The most I've done is 315, but it honestly felt pretty easy. Could probably do more. But I never bother trying. Just because it's scary to try. I don't want to fucking die. Or injure my chest. Can't even do it a bit with the actual MatPat now. True. How sad. Not 350 kilograms. Ounce. If I could do 350 kilograms, I would be probably pretty good.    One of the top 10 strongest men in the world. Pine&Coke crew! But Pine&Coke wouldn't do stuff like that, I don't think. The coin needs to be fixed. The one inside the bridge, I already fixed that. Do not worry. I'll fix it. Alright, let's try the Pokey. I will be very surprised if the Pokey behavior was still working as intended. But let's give it a try. Global Tumbleweed Rotation. You joke, but that genuinely... This is actually crazy. Okay, fun fact. In our game, there's still the random table from Mario 64, but there's one that's significantly different. In Mario 64, if you had a random rotation that was generated, every rotation, like 16 rotations out of the 65,000 possibilities, would look the same. So if someone generated a random rotation for the Tumbleweed and it was off, like it was just an impossible rotation, you would be able to see that. Like if someone cheated the speedrun, you would be able to see that. But in this game, every rotation is unique, because we actually use a signed approximation algorithm instead of a rounded lot. So actually, you could catch a cheater pretty easily in this game, if their RNG table was off, because every rotation is going to be unique. They need to be on the exact same RNG value to not be caught. Fun fact. Every Tumbleweed is personalized. It's not quite personalized, but it's at least unique enough, 1 in 65,000. Wouldn't you feel special knowing you're 1 in 65,000? I would feel like such a special little cookie. Yeah, the blinking one is pretty obvious, to be fair. I'm surprised that's a tech that only they started doing like so recently, because that's something that we've known for years. This is the funniest one. I've seen a TAS of Paper Mario 64, crashing windows. You can crash windows by playing Paper Mario. Isn't that beautiful? This is garbage. I can't really hear the audio, so I won't hear your response. I don't know how to do automatic subtitles. Otherwise, I would. Yep, that's exactly what it does, cat. There is a bug like that in Bizarre Cosmo. It's not just in Project 64. Remember when I said that I wouldn't be surprised? If the pokey just worked This is what we got this is pokey peak performance Let's see what is wrong with the pokey Oh Let's compare to a normal pokey from vanilla Mario 64, maybe there's changes here Looks great ship it We Can't theory bait the youtubers with every little thing. Well, this is a buggy piece of shit in the end You have to spawn the body segments manually It spawns them in a loop Okay, so they look pretty similar First thing that I'm noticing that should be different I Actually, it should be here and they shouldn't be billboarded any part of it should be billboarded This should do the trick I think this one is Not one with collision at all, but so what was this one here again? John actors most normal enemies are actors on this list Hey, this is such a useless list who made this this is fucking stupid. That's not that's not how you come in code Can in fact with Mario and destructive that's what I wanted to know Well, I'm actually with Mario, you know I Actually, this is the best list then Why aren't they commented like this? This is a way better. Like what what is this? Why are you describing what they're used for instead of describing what they do? You Hello Zelda Did you move to it I moved half a year ago I've been living here for quite a while I Okay, let's Debug this by just printing stuff. I Feel like Pocky is just using outdated API calls if you can call this an API It's not even been a full half year yet hardly I've only been here for like five months and a week That's when I moved into the wood dimension So you see how I popped up and then instantly just disappeared again interesting You Seems that the pokey body parts just instantly die You How the skelly Koopas called again dry bones You casual How do I like big I'm not into that Hmm  Hello innovator So it's a 32 pointer what a stupid function You Yeah changing this You DKC free. All right. Let me look at them. Oh This game I don't like 2d platformers. So that's no I don't like it. I would never play it So the platformers are just unplayable for me You Yeah, we're just gonna do a debug thing here see if the parts extra spawn You just haven't played in the right 2d platformers. I Haven't played one 3d platformer that I like other than Yoshi's Island when I was a little kid But maybe there's something I would like but like it's gonna be difficult to find He says every game that is also true, I'm very I very much hate most games Certain points to plan efficient. Oh, no, my debug prints are inefficient. No, what now? Also, that's not printer Okay, so the parts spawn But they're invisible Oh No, we're doing a buzzfeed cuz please nothing to cringe Yeah, the problem with 2d platformers for me is like you actually just can't see the level and games like Sonic or like even if you can't see the level, it's just Boring don't like it. I Just lose all motivation to play after dying once cuz it's just like Singing get me out actually smash trust me. He has a fun 2d platformer. I forgot that I'm also the number one boss fight hater. I don't like boss fights and video games You Guys need to realize I hate games When you say you would love this game, I always thinking where this guy doesn't know me at all It's a platform-based fighter Well But now we're back to language archetypes, right I think melee and fit into the archetype of a platformer. It just might be closer to the archetype of a platform-based fighter You know what? I mean? I Mean something bizarre is going on in the party This is just a vanilla behavior, by the way It just somehow broke while we were just making the rest of the game, which makes sense You don't need to see the right of me you don't control me I can't see the right of me. Oh look there's fishes I Don't remember what the fight was, but I probably wouldn't have hated it though. I Think boss fights work for the spectacle. It's just that the gameplay in boss fights most of the time doesn't Okay Okay, so they spawn in and they scale up to three I Wonder if this just kills them down to zero again I Think of these ones  Nope that didn't fix anything. Also, why is the head rendering like this? And really shouldn't be looking like this I also don't think that these need angle to Mario do they? They do not this is an unnecessarily intense operation Just make a new pokey, I don't want to make a whole new pokey if I could prevent that Recompile your product Linux you want to I just have this thing here. Press L barrel and then enter it does that Oh Just do everything again, why aren't you case? You The seal is fine though, isn't it? This looks good to me The head is also just on the floor There's probably like a million different issues here and not just one let's print this one as well Yes, my intelligence is never working I don't know why I don't know how to fix it All right, see I still mean I Just installed vs. Alec I Don't use any special tools Okay, so all five body parts are alive And if they all scaled at zero or something You You have to pretend you're doing work alongside this thing that's unlucky Wait This should be a valid Geo layout. Yeah What if we just use a different model just for testing what if we just use The warp pipe or both what happens now Yeah, they may be beneath the ground Interesting It's still just a hat here That is good to know very good to know So what spawns here is only the pokey spawner and not the pokey itself All the pokey parts themselves are invisible So every behavior pokey parts is not existing So  We do not want to scale them up, right, so that's why we see them spawn and really big So Something in behave pokey body parts must be murdering them This doesn't seem to do anything other than Come update flags here Okay, and the one with no beep herm should update its face to be The same as the parent object And And Then we also don't need to update this Yeah Let's just delete the base decomp comments So the base head seems to not be computed And we also don't need to update the meeting here It's also not update this yeah, let's see how this goes I Spawned in for one frame. Oh Uh-huh, he's up there I found him And all the body parts are here too interesting Now the other segments were inside of him so things are definitely going on I Just Gonna make it so that the others you know if it's not I wish I had auto complete so I would know if this is correct refrenda billboard cool but really help if I had any kind of how to complete here GFX.load.flex yeah he must use AI I wish AI was trained on Mario 64 code that would help so much okay next question is why are so many of them just up in the air can you guys still hear the oven or is it gone now music is playing oh so you can't hear the oven that's good there used to be just a really really loud oven in the background that turns on sometimes but it is not here right now all right let's see why it's getting the height so wrong do you do for work I just program I think it's pretty easy to get a programming job but I don't know I just hear it's so easy all the time they're all so high the fuck yep I work at Gears for Breakfast but anything I say is not officially endorsed by Gears for Breakfast do not take anything I say serious I am NOT the official ambassador music is playing I just felt the need to say that because I don't want to get the company in trouble over me saying some dumb shit yeah exactly can't believe Gears for Breakfast hates 2d games why are they employing this guy get him fired fuck it this guy sucks Oh Gears for Breakfast is modding Mario 64 uh-oh now they're really in our waters with Nintendo 0.1 how is this going on wait do they maybe just not have gravity like they would usually do and that's why this happens yeah i wonder what they're developing right now nobody knows so so but then they want uh people to not even comment about what we're developing and i don't want to anything hmm so it's contested on everything but it still doesn't seem to actually cause the thing to be intactable so they shouldn't be getting their elevation from there they should be getting their elevation from just falling down but here they do spawn it like yeah what if we run j in it and spawn this is a function that is only required on my game because um of race conditions between the graphics threads and render threads at the render thread on the game thread but this should just remove the pop-in yeah exactly daily that is how it's supposed to be he was there for one frame and then he just said no i saw him i saw you you little bitch you pokey  let's try something else it's like they instantly snap to the sides what if i remove this just as a test it's like the bay side is just set to zero or something even though it really shouldn't be nope it's not this piece of code that's setting them up what's there's nothing else directly acting on that though not good times well i didn't set any heights at all it's the crazy thing it's like they just snap up there wait wait wait wait what if the main pokey update behavior here the 1.1 busters what if the code is not even in the pokey part but rather in the wandering here no that seems all good okay let's start stopping code until it works until it stops happening rather no i was thinking maybe the pokey wandering thing which is the pokey spawner doing it was forcibly setting the position to something nope it's in the actual pokey part that this happens interesting let's try doing it right here so i don't even know why the behavior i got broken in the first place it's kind of a thing that always happens i just like optimize my stuff and then really old vanilla stuff just breaks when's the waterway coming along you snake it's my video to make i'm not making a water video have you spoken before not in this sec hmm it's still fine so interesting what did you change i'm just stubbing out vanilla codes there must be something in the normal pokey behavior that's just causing the segments to go up like that oh what the fuck is it seriously orobin name move standard what oh and it's the mario getting hit noise yep it's literally just the standard pokey movements causing that how how is currently j move standard doing this they should not spawn in with velocity so is there water or something here well it worked fine mario 64 to be fair it's just the interaction with my engine stopped breaking it stopped working this is the mario and luigi green team osc hello beta long time no see no i've never heard anyone having issues with pokies it must be an interaction with my engine here so check this out see if it still breaks give me some bonus show me up no that's what it must be though daily dolphin delphox another dolphin here in delphox still doesn't explain why his face is like that but i guess it'll work  where's currently j will fly here so it legit just looks like water it looks like it's water but there's no way it's actually in water is it the surface actions speak louder than words like actions can't speak at all do you not understand idioms better unbelievable though unironically i think idioms are really dumb i don't like them because like why are people making idioms like just say the words you want to say bro so i think idioms are fine but only if you want to use your words metaphorically idioms are easy to remember oh idioms are easier to remember than the words you literally want to say that's not true so let me try to find a precise way to describe a thought sometimes i'm trying to think of an idea of my hate especially right so instead of saying rare some people say few and far between just say rare dude what's what's your problem so no it's color to your words and that's noise to your words if you want to be artistic with your words you still need to be like clear on what your intent is that's how you paint the picture with words it allows essay weapons to be easier to rule and countermeasures more interesting and saying it makes my word more interesting to read no does that different when you say it adds color to my words you want to evoke a specific emotion you want to evoke the emotion of something artistic right that's why i instantly went to if you want to be artistic with your words because saying it adds color to your words you're using the implication of color with the arts when you say i want it to be more interesting to read you're not necessarily saying that you want it to be more expression heavy you're just saying you want it to be more interesting which doesn't have to be more expression heavy it could be more interesting information so   what if is because they're not updating the floor height okay something that flourished i think you just understand the meaning of it maybe but it's still a different intention it's not the same thing okay i think this was the reason it broke is because um when the thing had no velocity i was forbidding it from updating its floor as an optimization but they needed to be updating the floor everything anyway because they are being moved by something else now it kind of works yeah the segments of individual floor heights really shouldn't be the case though so i value language that is concise and precise so if you just add on the Things tend to just make it worse for me. I don't know Pochu. There was something with scale going on in here, right? This was an issue. Let's find the right scale here. Wait, actually no. There was a thing where if you squish them the scale changes. We gotta experiment more with this, right? Let's figure out what's going wrong with the scale on the Poki. There's all sorts of things going wrong with the collision boxes I find. What are snowmen hiding? Parrots. Indiums cause too many bites, that's also true. Signals are too far apart from one another, there are gaps in between. I think their scale is too small. I think there's some weird scaling code going on here. Because you saw me when I ground pounded it. Like I did some weird scale thing. Yeah, you see that? You see what I mean? I'm gonna restart vsc. I got whupped. Dude that was impossible to bait! And it's blacked. Looks fine to me though. I got whupped. We scale it to 0 and that makes it scale up. Up. Off. Looks like there's code to scale it up to 3 times as big. But this code is not running. I know why. I'm pretty sure this was supposed to be here. There's still something weird about the hitbox. But I think with this we'll have it mostly done. We do need to scale it down a bit though. Probably 0.7. I just noticed I asked a stupid question. It's very good isn't it? Whenever someone asks something really dumb I can tell them to just redeem channel points. Or to just not answer the question. Isn't that perfect? Thick. He's thick. How do I hit him? It seems just jumping on him doesn't work. Do we need to ground pound him always? That's not how it works on R64. Shit what is that beta? Yeah you can normally jump on the Pokey. So this is still a bit weird. I have not played Portal for the N64. Why wouldn't I want to play a worse version of Portal? Oh I would definitely be a Dino Nugget beta. That's barely even a question. Come on. I don't know.    Come on. I haven't had Chicken Nuggets in so long. God damn. That seems to be an appropriate size for the body parts. I think I'm liking this. I don't know. Does Will want to play Sona? Nope. I'm pretty sure for these to work I need to do this. Because there's some pretty stupid optimization in my engine that doesn't work without this. One fish, two fish, red fish or blue fish? I'll take two fish. Nope. The top part still doesn't work. I can Pikmin but I don't know if I want to.  It's painting on the egg. That's actually just real lighting in game. The game is doing that at runtime. Which is the beautiful part. What the fuck? I'm not sure FunGuy.  Wait, I played against a guy called FunGuy on Smash Mini today. He was really good. Is that you? He played Fox. Does the billboard cannon just not work? I'm gonna look at the other Poké. Let me see if that still works. He'll take credit anyway. The guy was insanely good too. How did we do this? That's the same thing and it works. Why does it not work here? Works here, doesn't work here. Yeah, I've released multiple hacks this week before. My first big hack was called Mario 64 Madness. I made that one in two weeks. It was really, really bad but it has 122 stars. It's technically a big hack. Then my next one, I don't know, maybe Ocarina of Time Mario 64 thing. It was like 170. It was made by a guy called It was made in like 6 or 7 months. Then there was Mario 64 Lost Impact which has 130 stars. That one took 2 years full-time work. That was definitely the most I've ever spent working on a hack. Then I made Mario 64 Land which has 132 stars I think. That one took like a year. The last time I tried to make something super polished was Lost Impact but it's nowhere near like this in quality so you can't really compare. Wait. Wait a second. I bet there was a reason that's why this was the wrong way around and I just ignored that. I bet that's the reason. Remember when we started working on it I was like, huh, why is this the wrong way around? I bet it was the wrong way around because it had to be. Sometimes it's hard to guess if it's multiple projects or one big one. I can kind of see that, yeah. I don't really label my videos. Yep, we just had to turn him around. And then something's really weird with the scale as well. Oh, right. The billboard matrix does not take a scale. So we have to scale it up by 3.333333333 Because our billboard matrix cannot take a scale. I forgot about that. Working on a fake N64 game in Godot. Nice, nice. Fake N64 games are doing really well nowadays. This proves that just after GameCube we were done with graphics. We didn't need anything anymore. Just like increase the FPS to a stable 60, maybe 120. Maybe give us a few more lighting effects and a few more polygons and then just re-graphics. That's too much. It should have been just 3. But it works now. We got the Pokey to work. The vanilla Mario 64 Pokey. Pokey has a hat. Unbelievable. And now I'm putting him everywhere. We finally fixed it. I finally fixed it. Took forever because some random Mario 64 functions broke because they needed really specific requirements. Because for some reason a Pokey needs 6 Raycasts. Actually, no. A Pokey was doing 36 Raycasts every tick. Think about this. 36 Raycasts. 37. Why was a Pokey doing 37 Raycasts every tick? To find the same floor over and over. I could not have anticipated that they needed like even 6 more. Because I knew they were gonna do 25. I didn't know they were gonna do 36. Yep, everybody was running the same code. But they all were running their own Raycasts. And my engine made it so that if an object doesn't move it doesn't Raycast the floor every tick. But they needed the floor to be Raycasted every tick. So I just removed that requirement basically. I also like that they now look the direction they move. That's very cute. One last fix. And that's to do with this one here. Floor pointer equals parent object dot floor pointer. Now they should have a proper shadow as well. Although the shadow might be a little bit too big   Let's scale the shadow down to like half again. Save more than 2 pokies in each event anyway. Yeah, that's probably just like 2 or 3. While we're at it let's increase their spawn distance a little bit. Because the distance, you see they had a distance of 2000. That's about as long as Mario's long jump. That was their view distance. Because of their fucking 37 Raycasts I'm sure they had to do that. Fucking shadow.c guy strikes again. The worst part of Mario 64 is gold. Yep, they have a shadow now. Very nice. I also like that the shadow becomes less opaque as they lose body parts. That looks so cool. Let's spawn distance 5000 Then we have a despawn distance of maybe like 5500 6000 This is fun. My doctors keep trying to tell me pokies don't exist. They're lying. Big pokie is out to get you. Hello, Zeina. Have you done anything new with shadows recently? I'm always doing new stuff with shadows. Did I mention that I'm a big fan of Yeah, you missed so many reference optimizations while you were gone. It's really sad actually. Yeah, I like how they look. I'm just worried that their hitbox is a bit weird. Like that just shouldn't happen. Yeah, the shadows aren't raytraced. Explain this case. I don't understand the hitbox. Is there just no more bouncing on them? No, you can bounce on them. I think the hitbox is just an unrelated bug that's like a general object thing and not a pokie thing. It's still crisp, but it's much more important to look at. I think it would be cool to be able to use the shadow as like this is who I am rather than this is what looks good. It would be cool to do that while walking though, I agree. That's true with Delphox actually. You can do something kinda like that. It's what they do in Banjo-Kazooie where they just render the 3D model flattened out. Wouldn't even be that hard, but you'd have to do all of Mario's animation calculation twice and render his polygons twice or at least a low poly model of him. It is actually pretty feasible. I imagine it's like half a millisecond of cost at most for Mario. Maybe even just like 300 realistically. But we are done for today. We finally got the pokies to work, we got some coins around, we got the bandits, we got some Chain Chomp action going and I'll see you guys next stream. Bye bye!
