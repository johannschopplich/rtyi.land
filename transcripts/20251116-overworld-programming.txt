Hello Twitch.tv, it is I, Ace Emunar, working on the overhaul today, not on this level. Hello FlyingMusicNotes, you're first. Hey Bay, KK, I see, KK. Hey SillySM64 and RaidLover, hello. Hello CynicalMax. Today we're working on the crabs, I hope. That'll be savory. This guy right here, saying I made some animations. Yikes, that's actually a lot of animation frames, or a lot of bones. Very, very many bones. Seeing this, it makes me wonder if I can maybe remove this bone here. Isn't that very animated? What if I remove these two bones? We should try it. Let's try it. See, KK said my SM64 will tell you 64. True. Does being able to keep your animations consistent on the N64? No, but having a lot of bones does. That looks nice, doesn't it? Yep, I think this is what we do. Two bones gone. Nice. Any OST wishes for today? You're gonna listen to your programmer? There's no path laid out for you. Okay. Idle. Idle local launch. Attack. Defense curl. Threatening dance. And beach curl walk. Let's see this in-game. What happened this time? No rule to make targets. Is it Arthur's stupid quaternion program again? No way. Is it because it has the name crap in it? And also it cares about case sensitivity? I think I need to rename all of these. Sure, let's do that. I remember playing this game. This works better. Are you working on Return to Your Silence? Yes, always. Anim Idle Threatening Dance. Looted by... Is that the question mark that's breaking it? Okay, let's actually just redo this. It wasn't me who broke it. It must have been Arthur Tilly. Who wrote the quaternion conversion tool. You're casing off? CASE THAT ARTHUR! Sometimes when I export an animation it says that... You see this? It's from your quaternion conversion tool. Conflicting types. What's it conflicting with? I can't put beachcrab in the title, because then the Python tool you wrote kind of spits the name wrong. If I don't put beachcrab in the title, then there's a different animation that has the same name. Do I just need to put random characters here? Make clean again. This seems to include modern AI controlling the Goombas. I actually wrote an AI to control Mario, and it actually did pretty well. There's a crash somewhere in RTY I have found, which is why I couldn't actually just put it on my N64 on the train yet. But once I can actually do that, I will do that. You can just add numbers. This is very annoying to deal with, and it kind of needs to be fixed. But that wasn't the only animation that broke before. So idle attack works as well. Idle defense grow. Let's see if this works. It works. Idle look around. This was the animation that wasn't working before. Okay, now it works. I couldn't have the name crab in the name, and also I needed to rename the idle animation. I'm not sure what the issue is still. It's because I can't put the word crab in the title. Because if I put the word crab in the title, it matches the actor name, and then it splits the file wrong somehow. Right? Right here it would say anim idle values. Wait, this is actually a stupid Fast64 thing. Why would it not say crab underscore anim underscore values? Okay, I do think we should blame Fast64 for this one. This is obviously going to conflict the name eventually. I do stream once a week usually. I added some prints that I need to remove. Anyway, you need to put crab animation in, because of the Fast64 thing I just pointed out. But it's also an issue where if your name is in the title, it doesn't work. Is that the issue? No, I can do that, I think. But the thing is, if one actor has an animation called idle, then another actor can't also have an animation named idle, because of Fast64. Because it externs anim underscore idle underscore values. But then also, on top of that, if you put the word crab in the title, it doesn't work. But then also, on top of that, there is a tool issue in your thing. Where if I name an animation crab anim idle, it's going to export crab underscore crab underscore idle. And the crab is being split. So it's splitting the toys somehow. I don't know. The hack will be finished tomorrow. Okay. Ooh, they look so nice. Now they just need some walk animations and turning around and stuff like that. And they need to be on the floor. Oh, you stripped the static keyword, so this wouldn't be an issue in Fast64. This would be an issue with the tool. Oh yeah, do you guys like this change to the long jump? Do you see what's different? Arthur saw this earlier, he cannot participate. Alright. I just want it to work, I don't care if they're static. Yep, I also edited the ground pound. Programming is very useful. People tell you that programming is difficult. They're stupid. Okay, wait. This is weird. Usually when you tell someone of someone else's opinion they're stupid, it means they have the wrong way of the world. But in programming, it's like if they think it's hard, they probably just don't know how to do it. I don't know. Usually when you tell someone of someone else's opinion they're stupid, it means they have the wrong way of the world. But in programming, it's like if they think it's hard, they probably just don't have the mental facilities for it. Or they do have the mental facilities for it, and they recognize that other people may not. But programming is just like a stat check. And it's like if you ask someone, is surviving a fall from two meters difficult? And a baby would have to answer yes, because they die. But an adult would have to answer no, because they're just going to break their legs. Hello Theodoros, I'm glad you like it. I'm glad you like it. It'll be easy for you to do right now. Go to my description, it just says, by the way, it says Align Consta 16 or whatever, you check the static in there. Alright, well, we'll test if that works, and if it doesn't work, we'll undo that. Yes, you're either going to do so or not. Well, there is things you can do to practice it, but it's a hard skill check, yeah. You know, I saw, I saw something amazing on Twitter. Yesterday, and it was someone saying, you're not bad at chess, you're bad at everything. It just so happens that chess is a good rhythm system, and I love that. It's so true. Yeah. The baby would bounce? Oh. Yeah, that's fair. I didn't know it was doing that either until just now. I think that's a new change. You know, it's just so that chess has a rating system that actually evaluates your skill. It actually just tells you, yeah, you kind of suck. Like other things. You looking around? Could you move, please? No. Okay, we got the moving, we need the graph y offsets. I think the graph y offset needs to match the size of the move I'm doing. And it's 156, but also we have the scale, basically. Cool. What is this? 116? Or 10? I think that would just be safe. Yeah, I will remove those eventually. They're easy to replace. I'm gonna do them per actor and put them above the actor itself instead of the object fields. It's just I have been too lazy to do that for the longest time. You know what? We'll start with this. Okay. Oh, I already have a new goal. That's cool. There you go. Fixed the code. Two seconds of work. I don't think I want the ball. Let's reuse that, I guess. It doesn't expect to target until it's scaled anyway. Okay. Yeah, I think so, too. But it doesn't really matter. I mean, if I put them above here, it wouldn't be a big deal, I guess, unless I wanted to rearrange them. I guess I should have defined for all first three OBJ fields. Zero, X, O, B or some shit like that. That's probably the ultimate way of doing this. They are not on the floor like I want them to be. Is the graph y offset scaled with the scale of the actor? I don't know. Huh? Modern processor. Is it? Why is it being used? Let me check this. Okay, this isn't being used. Cool. Cool. I'm thinking maybe this is scaled with the actor's scale. Actually, I should put this here. Oh! Fucking, no. That's why it didn't work. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, well. You're very quiet, by the way. I can turn up my microphone a little bit, but when I tried this, it was way too loud. How is this? I blame OBS. Okay, now they're in the ground. Only a little bit. Oh, that looks nice. Okay. They're sliding too much. Compute run on the elf. No, I want step-off collision. Okay. This anymore? So, step-off collision is my new step function in R2D2 that I use for everything. Let's make them stop in front of the goal by just a little bit. And this can be symmetric. It's an old behavior, so there's a lot of oddities like this. Okay, so what actually they were doing is they were going to the goal and then they were sliding a little more because they were not fully reaching the goal before they started slowing down. This is an uncompressed music, so you can turn the music down or yourself up, either way. Alright, I can turn the music slightly down as well. Level you made in the sky? I made a few levels in the sky. Doesn't really narrow it down too much. Okay. Let's do... So they work sideways. I think that's all we need. They should look nice now. Actually, they were slightly in the ground. Let's fix that too. I forgot to ja... JA! I bet you call them Yoshi instead of Joshi. Oops, I gave them buoyancy. Oops, I forgot to give them gravity. Joshi the Boshi. No. Look, man, I'm German. I don't want them to have any buoyancy. I don't want them to have any buoyancy. Or drag or friction. I still don't know what drag is. I think I removed the concept of drag. There we go! What do you think of my crabs? Lastly, I want to scale their animation speeds by their forward velocity. Let's scale their forward walking speed here. Let's get them slightly off the ground again. The walk animation needs to be elongated by around 5. Let's export this again. I'll do it by 8. And then... Does that make sense? The highest we can go is 16. So, it does make sense. But... I also made it 5 times faster. Still, let's multiply this by 5 as well. And put brackets, because I don't have enough brackets. Can you ask me a question? He's been itching to ask me a question all day. He's been itching to ask me a question all day. Now I have to relentlessly attack Mario? No! They're NPCs. They don't care about you. Crabs don't care about your feelings. Oh, that looks perfect! Look at that! Oh, why are you sliding? I don't like the sliding. The sliding has to stop. We'll use 100 even. I think this will stop the sliding. I just want to know if I can... Oh, wait! Wouldn't you then have one question to ask me? And the question would be whether you can ask me a question. The answer is no. Oh, okay. Mario's water knockback action states look so brutal. Oh! Okay. We also want the crabs to be able to be jumped on, I think. So they go into their shell. With... This defense card animation. And we have our function here for that. This song is driving me nuts! How long does this go for? I'm so sick of this. Guys, give me anything else to listen to. Let's just... Do nothing. Do nothing. Do nothing. Jumped on response. Let's just scroll up. Scroll up. Fast attack response is also... Do nothing. Button is nothing. Attack Mario response is... Play. And that's all you have to do in this repository. Isn't that nice? Attack damage is also wrong. Let's... Actually, it's not. It's something else. Can be jumped on and can be punched. Direct punchable. Can be punched and can be punched? No. You know what? I'm just making shit up. Why not just this? Fuck it. We don't need to make an indirect type. BLJ is still intact. I haven't changed anything. Yeah. I can just make shit up like this. And it doesn't exist yet. Isn't that cool? Let's do something else here. This. This. If you have no pointers and references, then you have no good delay in your life. This will be anim1. Anim2. And this will be anim2. Reset the animations here. This will be a rough outline of this, just to make sure this works. Will it be over-exploited in Mario 64? Hopefully. Wait. Right, this is not how it works anymore. Note how no one here is asking if they can ask a question before asking a question. True. How rude. That's a joke. Please never ask me if you can ask a question. I will murder you. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. It... It just works. It just works. I need an OST. Any wishes? Can you ask me a question? Yes. My freshman dive jump camera vid? What a cool piece of trivia. The DS version doesn't have it? Wouldn't think Mario 64 does, right? And the DS doesn't have it? That is fucking insane. Actually, you know what? That's a great idea. What's the best way to find it? I'm on your SoundCloud. Albums. Cosmic Cruise. Funk League. Hmm. How do I find the bonus track playlists? Oh, playlists. Ah. Alright, let's listen to this. 62 songs. These are RTYI songs that couldn't quite make it into the game for one reason or another. Usually because we don't have that much space. Or because we went with another song that's more fitting. You know, half the time that we have to not go with a song, it's like, this song is too complicated for me, I don't get it. Or it's like, Badoop just felt like making a song, cos he had some divine inspiration to just put out a banger, but there's no fit for it. Okay, and when I run into them, they should do an attack animation. He didn't attack at all. Are you kidding me? Okay. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. Okay, that's also not good. It needs to be... This. Well, he's not attacking me. Oh, can we punch? Just wrong, it's not damage Mario. Okay. Yes. Well, there's 62 tracks in this bonus playlist right now. And that's just right now. There's also like 100 songs in the game. That's actually crazy that there's like almost 200 songs for this game and we're not even done. I don't see an animation being played here. Bro has had enough. Okay. I really like the voices in this. It makes the song... It pulls the song together. Okay, so it seems player-attacked enemies are not being called. That's not right. The hitbox seems really small. It is. You're not really supposed to hurt these guys. It doesn't do anything. Okay, yeah, the attack Mario response is not playing. How? Why? 1, 2, 3, 4... Are they in the wrong order? 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4... Okay, wait. That looks correct, actually. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4... That's true, but... If you put lyrics in just some songs, it's going to feel really weird. If you put lyrics in just some songs, it's going to feel really weird. Let's see what attack type we get here. Oops. That's bad. That could be why... The Mario 64 AI is crashing. That could be why... The Mario 64 AI is crashing. No floor during camera action. Actually, no, nevermind. That would have been something. Wait, I bet it's because of my neural output or something. A000? A000? A000? What? What? Okay. Okay. Let me think about the best way to do this. So here we just write the interaction. Here we just write the interaction. Its status wasn't... Its status wasn't... It's attacked. Is that good? Yes, that is good. That is also fine. That is also fine. Okay. I think we need this. Well, I use print format to text, which is just... And text at the ends for the skin, basically. They're not doing what I need. Wait. This is what I need. How's the crab working? The crab is working amazingly. New song? No, we're just listening to the RTYI bonus track album. This song is called... Empire of the Plumber. There are 62 songs in the bonus track album. There we go. Look at that. You run into it and the crab is like... You fucking idiot. You jump on the crab and it's like... Nope, I'm outta here. The crabs look so clean. He is beautiful. Now we can go on to work on the big crabs. I need to set the shadow radius. Where do I need this? Oh, there we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. Where do I need this? 2,000?! Okay, maybe I don't need to set the shadow value. This does it automatically. All good. Time to make the big mean crabs. SuperMira64, true. Yeah, I just had to make them work sidewards and then that worked fine. Isn't that well known that crabs walk side to side? It was well known when I grew up, where I knew there was a common meme. I think it's like... Cats meow, crabs walk sidewards, dogs go woof. Basic crab knowledge. They don't learn that walks go woof until they're old? I believe it, dude. But it's because of COVID. Not their fault. You know, without COVID, American children wouldn't be so far behind. They'd learn about woof way earlier. So now if you would, sound dogs make any frills for 10 seconds and broke down crying. Yeah, understandable. Do you know if anyone's done normal voice acting for the N64? Do you minimize register spilling and such? Do you mind something like... Wait. What the fuck? Something like this? What do you mean in the compiler? I think they're working on something kinda like that on the homebrew side. But I'm kinda not really involved with compilers. I only know how to beat them into submission. A little bit. What's this? Oh yeah, alarm song? Oh, what's this for? An alarm song for the Bob-omb factory? I don't know. Can you use global and not spill it? But nothing more fancy than that. Yeah. Yeah, I've never seen anyone do that. Let's throw the siren in, this is pretty good. Oh yeah. Made it around the same time. Ah, I see. You know, if we ever produce a cartridge with all the RTY songs and all the bonus songs, that's going to be so hype. That's going to be like a must-have. For any serious RTY fans. The crabs are still fitting to the song. Oh, we won? I hope so, man. The homebrew community has a song format called Opus, which is a much more compressed format. And that means it will be a lot easier to put in all the songs we want. They're like, I think, 9x compression or something like that. So it should theoretically be possible to fit all the bonus songs onto an N64 cartridge. Is the song Deltarune? I'm pretty sure the song's older than Deltarune. Actually, maybe it's not older than Deltarune. I don't know. Does decompressing Opus work? Do you just do it on a secret installer because memband has everything? No, it would be like a separate cartridge just for the OST. We don't use Opus in this game. Specifically because you use more memory bandwidth with Opus. I don't know. Do we need a save flag for this or do you just get a star? Can we write down a star for this? No, you can ask those questions. They're good questions. Does it tie into how you unlock the underwater cave? No, but it ties into how you unlock Marty's level. Marty, are you in chat? Maybe I can show you how it works real quick if you want. Maybe it gives you inspiration for your level. That's very good to hear, Badoop. Dang, that's great that everyone's enjoying the work on this. The crazy thing for me is I've been working on this for like 5 years now and I'm not suffering completely. Which is weird. When I was working on Last Impact, the entire last 18 months of the process was suffering. Out of 24 months. With RTYI, I don't have it. Generational game, true. Okay, this has to get a star, I think. Just so we can hit the 200. How did I write that down? It's an event. Oh yeah, we had this written down. Makes sense. The crazy part is we don't even know it's really good yet. We know it's charming, but I am behind the scenes running playtests every 1 or 2 weeks right now. And I'm getting good feedback and I think it will all be fun. I think it just needs to be charming to be fun even. But then it's also fun on top of being charming. We just have to make sure that the game won't be frustrating. That is my biggest worry. That the design we use is too archaic. If you are fine making slop. But we don't want to make slop. If we wanted to make slop, I'd add a double jump to this game. And then it would be easy as hell. You can just take any 3D platformer, add a double jump and turn it into slop. And it will be digestible. I am getting some random testers as well. But of course I am also mostly having fans at my fingertips available to test for me. Do you think Quest 1 was too easy? I don't think easy is ever a problem in game design. You can say it's unengaging maybe. But that's a separate problem. I don't think it's unengaging though. I missed it to add custom stuff that didn't make the game better. I tried to take 2000 hours to play with an assembly. Well yeah, around half of Lost Effect's time was spent on just doing it in an assembly. Because we couldn't program in C back then. There's an extra gameplay to it. I see. There's an extra gameplay to it. I see. Well, testers enjoyed that, so... Alright, so I don't think we need to do anything in this regard. Let me just figure out how to do deep collision here. Yeah. But okay, my plan right now, design-wise for the game, is we test everything, make sure it's not super frustrating, and then we try to get as many random testers as we can. And then, if something is bad, we can still figure it out. But so far I don't think that's a real issue we have. I'm still doing it on best friends, do you agree? I'm still doing it on best friends, do you agree? Mmm... Culling radius is not scaled correctly. Mmm... I don't know, I don't think we need to constantly blast the player with audiovisual stimuli, like they're some kind of brainwashed tiktok scroller. Why are we doing massive crabs? They are here and they're bothering the fish, they're telling the fish you can't get in. You can beat the boss without noticing. Oh, I've much improved that since. It's not like that anymore. There's a lot more subtle hints as to what's going on. So, during the demo, the last demo, there was probably only like a 60% chance players would even notice how to beat the Goomba before they beat him. Now it's like 99%. There's plenty of people in the Mario 64 community that are willing to test the game for you. Especially if you're good in games, so someone wouldn't complain about beating the game a little more. It's a dangerous ingredient, it's like salt in food. If you have none, it sucks, but you can very easily add too much. Hello, XPN. Yeah, don't worry, those things are addressed. It's not like you can't beat the Goomba. Crab stream, true. I don't send people the whole game when I make them beta test. I only send them the part that they need to test. I have had whole game beta tests, but those were like the person coming to my house. So they were never given the actual ROM. There are other things to watch. The new show by the guy behind Breaking Bad is very good. I feel like you'd be arguing in favor of the villain. There's a new show by the Breaking Bad guys. First of all, it's fucking hype. What is it? What's it about? And why would I agree with the villain? Okay, tell me what the villain does. Before I take a guess at it. Oh yeah, Marky, are you here? I should send this to Marky. I will send it to him right now. He's making this level, so... Marky is almost done with this level. He keeps sending me progress updates. Look at it, it looks so spiral. Isn't that cool? This looks so spiral to me. He's a big spiral fan. I wish they made a good release of the spiral games. Just one. I would love to play them. But somehow spiral has been shafted. Wait, what? Oh. Makes sense. Such detail and such poor specs still amaze me. Maybe even more when I was in the mid 90s. No! Don't bring up R34! Did I change it from Climbable to Climbable? Was that me? Or was it always like that? Oh. Why no collision? Because I swapped the function names. That will do it. The racist version of the video you posted 11 years ago? Dude, that was the OG clickbait. To put cropped hentai into your YouTube thumbnails. Okay. I gotta lower this collision a little bit. I'll desmask the ninja like that. You think they should be a little smaller? Fine. 45. Dude, guys, can you believe I'm sponsored by Raycon now? I gotta make the video for Raycon soon. The Raycon earbuds. I went on Reddit and people on Reddit fucking hate them. But then I tried them and they're actually good. Do you think the problems with Redditors are with me? Don't say with me. Okay. You think the good thing is you haven't had better stuff? That's also true, I have not had better stuff. What about the collision engine where you say Raycon instead of Raycast? I'm sure Raycon would like that a lot. Dude, the ad brief is funny. In the ad brief they say I cannot talk about Kim Kardashian or Ray J. I don't know who these people are. Well, I've heard of Kim Kardashian, but I don't know exactly why. That's against the rules. Still funny. Three months after the video is out, I think I'm not allowed to talk about Kim Kardashian on my YouTube channel, which is going to be a serious hit to my content, but I think we'll deal with it just this once. Who made a porn movie that started her career? That's how her career started? Wasn't she with Kanye West? Wait, so are you telling me Kanye West, basically his whole career, he was like married to a porn star? Last comment was when he refused to answer and just called you stupid. Is that a reddit answer or is that more like a stack overflow answer? I feel like the reddit answer would be like, he doesn't know, or something like, I guess you'll just have to find out for yourself. You fool, you should take my advice. You will not like this, yet anything else. This is YouTube sponsorship stuff, fucking obviously. Yeah, I know he's like the founder. I hate function names. I wish we just had numbers. Numbers are so much easier to remember than the name. He's still a shareholder, well, being a shareholder doesn't mean anything. I'm probably a Raycon shareholder, realistically, right? Dude, 2CA144, that's the play sound function in Mario 64. What's it in my engine? Cool, underscore VG, underscore play sound, okay, I can remember that. Play sound is 8031EB00. It's play sound in my engine. Okay, 8029DB48 is, I don't know what it is in my function engine, 8029DB48. I think GeoSwitchAnimState, but I have to look it up. Okay, I got it right, still. Mario's loop is, shit, what is it in vanilla Mario 64? 802CB1C0 is the debug menu. Can you design a lid for a fingerprint box? I have to probably remember that my lid isn't solid, I tried solving the modifier, but it just makes the lid explode in all directions, so I don't know how to fix it. You probably have bad backface cutting. Try to select everything and hit Alt-N or Shift-N. That's just the autism speaking. No, numbers are just easier for me. I don't think I have the autism. Which one's the function that does this one? You have the autism, wow! I don't! Unbelievable. Just because I'm good with maths and spend all my time programming... you sound like you're doing... ...shut up! ...That's... no. The diet comes to mind before your programming? My diet is perfectly fine! Hello Rikimaru! Is it to add to the tuna shake? Nothing wrong with a little disgusting tuna shake. Sometimes you just have to lock in like that. We will not do it right away since I have to prepare it first, but yes, we will have a tuna shake on stream. You're having special pipes when you go down and there's a Mario Party game coming later from the beacon when you get a star if you win? Oh, so it's like, you play Mario 64 and then the game's just like, fuck you, play Mario Party! And then you play Mario Party and then you get to play Mario 64? No, no, no, you have to combine it to a million to get the shake. No, no, no, you can't just make me... It's one tenth of a shake each one, okay? You have to combine it. I guess I should advertise it more, it would be funnier. Pussy, you're the pussy. It does not say that? I think it does. Does it not? I'm checking this out. Infinite channel points. Tuna shake. It says that ten people need to redeem this. Current progress, two out of ten. Okay. We'll do this, this, and this. Ooh, I remember this one. I think this one's my favourite. You just asked me a stupid question, did you just redeem that? Dude, yes, you can ask me a stupid question if you redeem that. Small print, what? Oh, right, the small print of my Twitch rewards. True. This is not what I want. Where did I copy this from? Oh my god, where is the function to find everything by bperm2? You know what? I'm gonna restart. And then, if you're not here... And then action three, they just run away. The move angle chart needs to approach 0x88. Okay. Okay. One star with bonus perm, that's not fine. You know what? It should be right about this. One star. Ah! Why is this so rarely used? Good function, though. We should probably spawn this elsewhere. Like, maybe off to the side? Ah, for now it's fine. Okay, let's see if it works. And then we need to add the hitboxes for the claws. Oh no, politics? Okay, here is my thought. Everyone's joking and clowning on him for apparently doing gay shit. But, I don't believe it. Listen. If he was into gay shit, there would be sexual assault allegations against him from men. And there aren't. Maybe just selectively assaults women only? I don't believe it. This function obviously doesn't work. But why? Wait. I'm just not gay, he's just lost a man. I don't think so. One selection is a guilty guy. It's more likely the new thing. I don't think it happened. Oh, I forgot to set the animation here. That would certainly do something. Idols do woke him up. Are there people that actually still have a muscle idol? I thought at this point, except for Twitter engagement forums, no one really was into that. It's actually crazy how Twitter warps people's perception of reality. It's so good at that. Can you imagine how much chat GPT is going to do that? Oh my god, it's going to be the best propaganda tool of all time. It's going to go crazy. I guess you guys joke about that all the time. Oh, I see. Makes sense. That is fucked up, Biomech. That is fucked up, Biomech. That is fucked up, Biomech. That was also quite nice. It's funny, people just accept being completely wrong and sometimes in trade-off for the convenience of just having to ask the question to their hallucination bot. But then again, people also accept just being completely wrong at times for the convenience of being able to drop certain qualifiers, like the word probably. Okay. Yeah, but the Mario Sunshine modems may be a bit too much. People accept being completely wrong with no justification too. Wait, this is Doki Doki Literature Club. This one. Reality, right? Let me pull this up real quick. Yeah, it's that one. Sure, Zena, but the game is not even that close to release yet. You've never heard this before? That's crazy. Wait, you know what? We can do this easier. One is walk, one is attack. One, two, three, four, five. Five is attack. Walk. Well, this is Creative Cardboards, right? We have a slightly improved version of this in the real game. So it was focusing something weird before as well. Eh, let's just see what happens now. Bro, this is complete nonsense. What the fuck is going on? So clearly, all crabs and shell is not working. House is not working. Oh, that's a good idea by Omeg. Where are the heavy crabs? They're gonna be bullying the fish. So they're gonna be evil and happy. If someone is evil and you make them unhappy, did you do something good? That's a good topic for chat. Yeah. It's always, you need to be compassionate with criminals and try to rehabilitate them into society. Unless you can tell me the specific crime they did, in which case they need to be dead. It's always like that. Can you bring well-being of good and evil to a simple animal such as the crab? That's also a fair point. The crab does not know what it's doing. Hello, Markiplier. Okay, seriously though, what the fuck is this? We don't speak of this again. The pipe is in general. I guess it's a general actor. Okay, that's not the animation I'm looking for. I know what's going on. I don't know what I did here or why I did this here, but this is what I know. Okay, I think now we've got it. I'm half asleep at the wheel, what the fuck? Do you need my opinion on something? This is still asking me to ask a question. But okay, go ahead. They need to be a bit slower with this animation. That's fine, that's easy to do. Yikes, this is difficult. You know what, I'm gonna fix this. I assume it's not just random, it is just random. Well, the snake case ones are vanilla Mario 64 functions. The Pascal ones are mine. So this way I can tell which code I still have to refactor. Because all the vanilla codes suck ass. Dude, Oily Boily Bay is honestly my favorite song in RTYI right now. It's like the most groovy one we have, I think. What about you guys? I mean, he is treating Euroboss 1 thing here, but he's very specifically taking the average. But he's also wrong. The dance at the end of this one was also good. There must be a single function that doesn't suck ass though. I can't think of one. Including the ZoomVSL, what else? Need extra delay frames. We'll just leave this for 20 extra frames. You know what, I need more. It has something of Mario Kart DS' tic-toc-toc now. This crab is extremely grateful for what I did for him. Alright. Wait, what did I fuck up this time? There's a broken log somewhere? There's a break here somewhere that I... Interesting. I don't give a fuck about it. What does it do? I think I've seen it, but I don't know what's the point of it. I don't know what's the point of it. I don't know what's the point of it. I don't know what's the point of it. You know what? We can just do this always. And then rotate them like 45 degrees. And then rotate them like 45 degrees. Uh, 90 degrees. This is fine. The point is that it's a lot cheaper than I actually see with equivalent specs. Oh. I see. Because of reasons that you can play your Steam games on the TV. Oh, that's cool. Has a lot of potential. It's cheaper than, like, a Switch or a PlayStation or an Xbox or something. I can see a lot of potential. As a game developer, I see a lot of potential in that. Because if we can unify hardware specs and have the machine we're designing for, it is going to be a lot easier to make sure that the game works for everyone and that it performs well. Any more expensive than a console? Then what's the point? I don't know. We'll just delay the star spawn so Mario has time to launch. We'll have the same kind of variation as for the Steam Deck. It's going to be $400. $400 doesn't sound too expensive. $1000 to $1200? That's more expensive than my PC. Why would it be that expensive? What does it do? Let's just believe it's $1000. $1000 is shit? That's an expensive computer. Oh, sorry, I'm not rich like you. I'm just a streamer, man. I don't get paid. I'm just a streamer. If it isn't irresponsible, it could be pretty good. Yeah. No way, you sit and write C on your spare time and don't have a decent salary. I'm just a streamer, I'm cool. Yeah. Yeah, that's more stars than I wanted. Oops, that makes sense. You know what, I don't want it to roll over. I know it's not going to roll over, but I don't want it to be possible for it to roll over. So... We'll do this. Fuck it, I don't care. It also happened too early. I don't like that. I did like how they moved, but I think they were inverted from what I wanted them to be. I think that's about it. I also think they should maybe be in that tile for a little bit longer. Let's do an under 50. Now we should have quite a bit of time to ground pound them. Okay, perfect. The stars still too early. How is this possible? Wait, what? Huh? How did it spawn multiple stars? I actually don't see it. I should have did this as well. I'll make it define. That's my rule. Any number more than one is to define. Is this important? Good enough. Ow. That's what I did wrong. Makes sense. Double promotion. Does this function then? It does. Now the crabs should have a scale-out animation so they don't just instantly pop out of existence. And then after that we only need to add hitboxes for the claws. And then do the fish thing. Perfect. Missing warp. Okay, it's trying to warp me out. Also makes sense. Because I did not set the B parameter on the star to make it a non-warping star. That's all that's needed. I don't think we have an animation for getting a star that doesn't fall out of the level in water. So I might have to do something there. But this should be fine for now. I might want to reduce the angle slightly at which they warp. Because if you look at this, it's more like slightly in this direction. Minus 20. So let's do 7 inch. Let's actually start working on the hitboxes right away. How is today? I'm good. I think we have a collision child. Hitbox. That's for solids. Hitbox. Wave hitbox. That's what I need. And then we need to make it claw-sized. We're gonna mark these with goombas for now. Actually, wrinkable box. Just because it's a little bigger. We don't null pointer check stuff if we don't have to. And we don't have to because this is never invalid. How does the pipe look in DMs? Let's see. Oh, this looks so Mario Galaxy. I like it. I think this is a fair hitbox for this. Let's see. Where is that here? We are scaled to 45%. So 724 multiplied by 0.45 is 2835315324? 324? Is that right? Someone fact check me. Forward offset is 351. Like 170, I guess. You know what, I'm typing this into Google. Oh, it's only 160. That goes against my expectation. The second parameter. And the up offset is... 483. I'm also typing this into Google, but I'm being lazy. No, where's my Google? 17. Now we need the radius and size. 200, so that's 180. Pipe is 719 instead of 360. This is a nice song. They have like a Christmas market or something. One damage is enough, actually. Is this where doing a sequel with what? What's the question? Wait. Right. Because they're rotated 45 degrees, this is going to happen. Okay. That was not what I wanted. It sounds like the song we're doing a sequel. Oh! It looks like I inverted the forward offset here. The radius is way too big. Something happened here. Did I not multiply by 0.5? Recorded the typewriter for this? That's sick. The listening to it, I thought, like, oh man, this would go hard in Patchmaker's Workshop. The location of the hitbox seems completely disjointed with where I'm hitting the hitbox. What the fuck? Huh? Something bizarre is going on here. The location seemed right, but where I'm hitting the hitboxes is random. It's like only one of them actually has hitboxes. Nope, that one has hitboxes too. But only on one floor. Oh, now it's there too. What? Now it's there too? And they're also doing 3 damage points instead of 2. Oh, wait. It's because they get initialized after I spawn them. Is there actually a 3D hitbox with another match? I don't know. Probably. Okay, that seems a lot better. Nice. That feels about right. The way they take their boxes with them. Alright. Okay, that should work. And with that, we have the crabs working. Next, we need to make the koi fish react to the crab problem appearing. So, basically the idea is, these crabs appear at the overworld randomly. I was thinking around 65 stars. So this is far into the game. And they chase out the fish and they're like, this is our river. And the fish are very sad about it. So the fish are going to just... What the fuck? Okay, that's a bad fish. That's a separate thing I need to fix. Anyway, that means the fish are not going to be here. And after you save the fish, the fish are going to give you a hint on how to get to the secret level. That's like a separate star. And to get to that secret level, you just need to follow the fish. And the fish just happen to be swimming in circles. Around this building here. I bet it's not... Oh, nevermind. There you go. That's the star. I should probably reduce that to two turns. Three feels like a lot. Which means that it's not a crab problem. Let's see if I can get... Oh, it's probably actually... There we go. There we go. That should still be big enough that no one does it accidentally. That's really the main thing. Anyway, I think we're done for today. We got the crabs in. Next time we'll have to program the koi to react to this. And that's the whole of the star done. And then we can... We can do the Yoshi hearts. Which I am very excited to do. The Yoshi hearts have been something I've been looking forward to for a while. Here's the hearts. They look very nice. Once the hearts are in, we can start putting Yoshis into the village and make this feel like a Yoshi village. There's definitely a way to do that, Severic, but I don't know how. Anyway, I will see you guys in the next stream. Not sure when, but hopefully.
