Hello, do you get water real quick? I got to change my title to birthday stream, there we go, happy birthday, thank you, thank you, thank you, everyone knows it is my birthday today, my 30th, I am now officially extremely old, I'm so exhausted today, I think I have not been getting enough vitamin D, you're mine, you're mine, any LST wishes today? You know what, Nintendo birthday music, let's see what I got, Nintendo music for a birthday party, you won't be here for another hour, oh shit, dang, okay, well, I guess we have to spend the first hour without the ice cream right then, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, we are almost done setting up our Lupon now, and then it's going to be so cool for all the fishes. I'm so glad that's finally done, I have no idea. Divorce sucks? You've been divorced, Sarah? Or are you just theorizing that divorce is bad? Fishpond, yes. We dug out like a 3000 gallon fishpond in our yard. I like having fish a lot. Hello, Leela, thank you for the happy birthday. Look at this guy, Leela. You're going through with the voice right now. Okay, that's not funny, it is kind of funny. How do you like that? I'm just going to update the text now. Am I the good friend? Leela, do you see this effect here? Can you believe I made that effect? Can you believe it? Can you believe it? Can you believe it? Can you believe I did that? Can you believe it? You can't believe it? No way, I can't believe this. Hey, where are they going? It's going fine so far. Recently I found out there's a lot of lead in a lot of protein powders. And I asked the people providing our protein powder, can I have the independent lab report that you guys claim you have? And they basically said no. Great. Someone's with blue on your phone? Dang, okay, sorry, that's unlucky. I guess you have to go and let his brain rot. So many athletes, really? A lot of athletes have colon cancer? I didn't know that. That is news to me. But it's actually quite a sweet show. So it's not brain rot? Nevermind, I take it back then. Put Bluey in the corner of the screen, I'm going to get DMCA'd. Oh, really? Oh, really? Is it this? Well, that's kind of saying that healthy people have less colon cancer. Hello, Garnard. This is such a birthday song. Nice, Lila. Lila, I managed to find a way to get your new Fast64 exports to compile, so I no longer need to cry about this one. Even though it looks stupid and inconsistent now. Okay, but is it only American athletes that are getting higher rates of colon cancer, or is it all athletes? Because that's a big difference. Thank you, Finity. Okay, what's the star count? Let's define the star count. Let's make it 30. You're waiting to start a formation? You plan to grow more? You start a formation? What is a formation? You want to- You're talking about self-improvement and about your puppy life at the same time, I'm a little concerned. It's an internship or training. Oh shit, nice! We got a Prime gift sub? Why did not show up? Either way, thank you for the Prime, if you actually need a Prime, and I somewhat didn't see it. For some reason, my brain has been feeling so slow and rotted the last few minutes, I felt like I could barely even talk yesterday. Did I get you a birthday cake? No, but Zaina's mom did. She made me one. Because you're 30? I think so too. But I also think it might be because I have too little vitamin D right now. And also, because I stopped eating protein shake, I don't have creatine. So, kind of two bad things at once. Riri said, fuck my stupid puppy life and you start insulting me because you're rude? There's no way I started insulting- Actually, maybe I would insult you for that. I don't know, calling yourself a puppy is just... I don't know. How do I put this without it sounding transphobic? That's true, I have seen you call yourself a slur first. See, that's what I mean. I can barely even talk anymore. Fuck you, Kees. Fine. Say whatever and if it gets clipped, then you're fucked. What a way to live. You will puppy and you will call me bald. Thank you, Marty. Marty, did you see the idea we had for where we're gonna put your level? Okay, I'll show it to you in a bit. Oh, have you started bringing in the extra levels from other people? Not yet, but soon. Did you wish her happy birthday? No. She doesn't even know it's my birthday. What does the bomb say after you pick him? Are you 38 now? I'm 17 now. No, I just turned 30. The fourth decade of my life has just started. Fuck, I know. Fuck, I'm old. I can't just give him an engineering way of talking. He's a big fucking brick. I just told him he bumped me. Alright, let's see this. What the fuck? Where's the text? None of the text I put in was here. Senna's DMing me. Old Master Yoshi, nice. He also has animations, oh nice. How is none of the code I wrote compiled? Am I completely crazy? I also have the same birthday as my uncle, so when my uncle writes me happy birthday, I have to write happy birthday back. What? What? I can't remember ever being this confused by code. BPM2 is 1. I haven't put in all the stuff for it yet. Honestly, I feel like it sometimes. Okay, I think I saved it. Glücklichen Weihnachtsbaumkartoffel. Oh, close enough, I guess. Okay, nice, that works. How do you open the debug menu again? That way. I just need to give myself a bunch of stars so I can actually... That should be 30. He's ICANing for your job. No, we're actually not allowed to use AI. We have a no AI policy at our company. The exception, of course, is if you're not using it to code, but rather to just look something up. You're allowed to use it as a Google substitute, but you're not actually allowed to write any code. Yeah, what is it doing? 30. I do work at Yes For Breakfast. Bro, it's so hard to find the star. Yes, correct. It is simply not allowed. I've tried almost every single one at this point. There we go. Okay, we have 45 stars, good. The bomb should be awake now. He is awake. Why did you make it like that? Because it's funny. I love it. That's so funny. If you just tell me to think of any Paper Mario inspired things in the game, I can't really think of anything. But I'm sure there are some. So here are 10 pieces of advice I could give you. Did he actually do that? Did he be like, oh my god, my fucking idiot son just asked me for advice? Actually, he probably didn't even do that. He probably just said, oh my god, my fucking idiot son just sent me a message. I'm not reading this shit. Go handle it. I don't think I would be in the credits of A Hand of Time because I didn't do anything for that game as far as I'm aware. Maybe I did and I don't just don't know about it. Maybe some of the code I wrote was just randomly used for the game too. I don't know. I don't think it was. He's an AI agent on my inbox constantly, so he doesn't have to answer me. Yeah, exactly. And then five years down the road after you've written to him daily and he wrote back daily, he's like, son, why do you never text me? I haven't seen a single one of your emails in five years. Do you miss Germany? What do you think of it? Yesterday I was looking at Instagram and there was a story of a guy in Germany who was sent a tax bill for $1,000 for dogs. He was like, you need to pay the dog tax, but he didn't have any dogs. So he asked, why do I have to pay the dog tax? And he said, we saw pictures of you posting pictures of dogs on your Facebook. So you have to pay the dog tax. And he didn't have any dogs. So they sued him. And in court they were like, yeah, this guy obviously doesn't have any fucking dogs. Like we checked his apartment. So he doesn't have to pay the tax, right? And he's like, no, you have to pay the tax. But going forward, you no longer have to pay the dog tax. But we still want those thousand euros from you for the dogs, for the dog tax that you didn't pay. All that is to say that I do not miss Germany. Because that pretty much sums up the German bureaucracy experience. No, he was sued for having to pay the dog tax and not paying it. And I've paid the dog tax a little more. That's what you get. Dog, not dog, dog. If you have a dog, like, woof, woof, then you have to pay for it. Yes, they thought he had dogs because he posted a picture with a dog on Facebook. And they just decided, well, it's a thousand euros now. And see, the reason he actually had to pay a thousand euros was because he replied by email. No, I don't have them. But he should have replied by the proper legal channels with signed electronic mail to say, no, I don't have any dogs to refute the tax. So that's why he still owed the thousand euros for the dogs he didn't have. Actually, I think they went even further after that. And they finally went to the decision that, yes, you still owe us the dog tax, but just for you, we'll give you 100% off. Which is just ridiculous. Remember the guy who had no license plate and had to pay a huge amount of traffic because of that? Yeah, I've heard of that. If you missed cases like that, like that one time Gates had to try to get taxes from a supermarket because they argued that the checkout was fair to be able to receive TV signals. Yeah, if you don't know, in Germany, if you have an apartment, you have to pay state TV. You have to pay, I think 19 euros a month to state TV. So that they can produce propaganda for you. And you have to pay that even if you don't own the TV, I'm pretty sure. When you're doing iScap, as soon as Biobank is off work. Because he needs to send it to me. Now we need to do the event flag here. Now we need to do the event flag here. Now we need to do the event flag here. Now we need to do the event flag here. Now we need to do the event flag here. Now we need to do the event flag here. Now we need to do the event flag here. Now we need to do the event flag here. This is fun. Genius code. Now we need to do the event flag here. Now we need to do the event flag here. Now we need to do the event flag here. Now we need to do the event flag here. Now we need to do the event flag here. I've heard that there is a whole movement of Nazi fanboys. There doesn't seem to be a skyrocketing. Really? I thought that was kind of like a shithole. I barely eat poutine. I barely eat poutine. I barely eat poutine. By 2040, there is no way you can make predictions about 2040 like that. I wonder if true Canadians do say sorry a lot. The worst thing Canadians do is say hello, how are you for everything. Hello, how are you? Oh shit, I forgot to tell you where the Love Lanterns would be. Oh shit, I forgot to tell you where the Love Lanterns would be. Oh shit, I forgot to tell you where the Love Lanterns would be. I'll show you what the idea was. So we have the idea that there would be fish here, swimming in the lake in the middle. This is like a major Yoshi town, where they have all the big fruit trees. And a bunch of Yoshis are going to live here. And there is a dojo there with an old man Yoshi. So anyway, there would be this fish here and it would be hinted that if you follow the fishes, you might find a secret. The idea would be that you have to find the secret entrance, there is going to be stuff in front of it. That will lead to a separate part of the overworld, but the gate, that leads to your level. So physically the location would be somewhere behind this forest here. So physically the location would be somewhere behind this forest here. Look at old master Yoshi, shooting. Yellow! Yellow! Yellow! Yellow! Yellow! You gotta make it doobly enough to get it once you figure out the design. He has a lot of triangles. But he looks pretty nice. I gotta figure out a way to reduce the triangles though. Not much. I like him. Oh, I see. That's his idol. Let's just talk. Do you know that we also wanted there to be a little fight with him? So basically he wants to be like, I only give my knowledge to the strong or something like that. And you start a fight with him, and he very slowly approaches you with the cane. And his attack is like, he goes like this with the cane, and that's like 1 damage. And you just have to hit him to beat him. And there's a very good chance that a lot of people here die before 2040. Actually, 86 people. We're probably all young, relatively speaking. 15 years? I think there's probably like a 2 or 3% chance that we all survive until 2040. Thank you, Kevin. I'm not too worried about it. Did anything actually happen on Y2K? Why would the year 2000 be special? I'm not too worried about it. I'm not too worried about it. Did anything actually happen on Y2K? Why would the year 2000 be special for computers? I don't think I ever understood that. Check the progress doc, Crunchy the Clown. I don't know. No! He's a joke fight. He must have no taste. What do you think of the light effect here, by the way? You see how the light is like, colliding with the walls and stuff? Is full darkness maybe too much? What if we keep like 10% brightness instead of 0? There's that one spot with the weird... ...brake and lights that I don't like. Hmm. Maybe I'm just crazy. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

Raises started renaming all the mats in my blender files double clarity, check that it doesn't mess with code stuff. It is for sure going to mess with code stuff, but it's probably fine. Made a quick collision map, okay. I probably have to remake the collision map from scratch just because of how specific it is and because I need like walk sounds and terrain particles and stuff. Looks completely fucked up on fastxml render for some reason, uh oh. Oh I see, that's a little concerning. Probably fine, I hope. Added a new start area with a big decorative starfish, sand and grass, okay so this is where you start. I feel like it's not really going to make a lot of sense, it's just going to be more like a place, okay yeah. So while separating the spawn from the main area you get this cool reveal when you turn the camera and see the whales, let's see. Start here, come around and it's like oh my god, yep that looks very cool. Coral rocks are now unified into a big coral floor, yep that's a lot nicer. I think I might need to audit this material too, yep that should look fine. The blue spiral conch now has water flowing out at the base, you need ice cap to climb it. Blue spiral conch, this one, aha, okay. The blue fake shell, teach me new names, I was forced to research this shit. Very right and loyal game chasers, but damn look at this thing, it's this one here, okay Add the sand dollar platform for an ice cap block between the two blue shells. Sand dollar platform for an ice cap block between the blue shells, this one. Need a bit of the sharp rip and drill, 12x spiral with the switch on it. Okay so the switch is still on here, got it. And two auger shells, 12x spiral, that's for platforming. One of the holes facing the center should spit Mario out if he gets swallowed by the whirlpool because instant death is not fun. Oh I see, we can do that, yeah. Let me edit to do this tier again, oh I can't just add this tier. What do I do? Whirlpool spit Mario out with the blue shell. And this is where he comes out of it again. Small clamshell under the auger shells with an ice cap block on it, this way the player is spit out right in front of the solution if they get caught in the jet stream, okay fair. Did the other pink conch, now it's a real hole instead of a texture, still doesn't lead anywhere though, yeah. This is something I'm a little iffy about, because people are gonna swim in here. I guess we can just put a red coin here. Very yummy like candy in my tummy on the whales, I agree, true. So from the end map, evil sneaky octagon behind the ice, unfortunately needed for this effect to work. Okay this octagon is not needed for this effect to work, but I see why you'd think it is needed. There's a solution around it, but applying that solution sucks, so I'll just keep it here for now. And it fins on the side, oh I see, cute. Rainbow pearl like mouth, yep that's very cool. Here's the marrow shell spiky stuff behind the whale with a queen scallop. Okay yeah, that looks more playable anyway. I suppose the shell should burst out of the pearl when the player gets the 8 red coins. Okay we can do that. Make that pearl explode into the red coin star, from the red coin star. I will place the design a bit above the water so you can see it better, but you'll need to lower it. Yeah I see. Oh. I'm guessing we need a bit flush with the water here. That looks like it's being dragged in by the whirlpool, oh by the UV map, I see. Lots of materials that don't have to render mod set. Another red coin star, one of the red coins is near the spawn area above the water, shouldn't be able to get it from swimming state, but it should be easy to reach with the ice cap. One of the 3rd coins is between the 2 blue shells, you need to be ice marrow in the whale's jet to reach it. Ice marrow on the whale's jet? What? I don't get that one. Make the angler shot with Mario, make the star burst out of the pearl, make the whale's jet only be solid by the ice cap, make the floating cockle shell hide the water inside of it. What? Make the floating cockle shell hide the water inside of it? Okay I'm confused on that one. This? I don't know what a cockle shell is. Oh! Okay that's a different one. Okay that's a difficult one but should be possible. You're still under the impression I'm working on ahead in time too. Do I see it correctly though that you removed all the level actors so I need to copy them over again? Is there a coin left somewhere for the reactor? Huh? Not in here though right? Huh? Not in here though right? Make the triangle detected. I think. Make the filter broken. Okay. Make the filter button in the outlier. Aha! There we go. Yeah that's not what I meant to do. Oh! That's better. So I'm gonna use a script to rename all the actors here. To make my life a little easier. There we go. Okay map switch still in the same position. Oh! I see a remapping error! Look at me improving Biobank's model. Hopefully. I see why this was difficult to edit. What the fuck? Huh? What am I even looking at? Oh! I think I can fix it. What the fuck? I was so sure I would fix it. Okay maybe it's not that easy. Fuck it! It's fine. You want the renaming script? I'll give it to you. It's not fine. Oh it's because it's only mirrored on one axis. Okay it actually is not possible to fix. Yeah this is the best we can do. Um... Are these animated textures? They are. I probably want to put them at 60fps instead of this though right? But for now I'd say this is fine. Let's export this and see how it looks. You think I would even fix it when you use it in your model? I mean you might miss one. You never know. He's going to be in... I think part 13 of the overworld. He shoots you into the sky. So he is very late to the game. It's going to be a while before we get there. Trying to enable extended RAM. Interesting. Where is extended RAM even set? What the hell? Will it read my repo settings if I do this? I think it did. Cool. Sand. Sand has an issue. Okay. These need to be I4s. And I bet... Oh we're not missing a lot. Nice. Water. Water. Also needs to be I4s. Coral 3. Okay. This is probably supposed to be an IA8. Okay. This one has the primitive color multiplication again. That we don't want. Not a big deal. Just slightly wasteful to do. Unless the prim alpha is not set to 1. But it is. I'm wondering how often this happens. I wonder if there is a bug in UFS64 that just puts the primitive multiplication in there or requires it to render correctly. Okay. Check that 001. What am I looking at here? There's a waterbox here that I'm not seeing being rendered. Why is it not being rendered? Oh I see. That will be why that is. I'm just going to make... Oh wait. I think they're just not enabled in the viewport. Oh what the fuck? Okay. Okay. Makes sense that it would be the animation. Can it have non-zero world rotation? Well good thing the world rotation is zero. Unless... Oh my god the area is rotated. The entire area is rotated. Oh no. I guess I can rotate the water by minus 90 degrees. No I can't. Idea. Okay. What the fuck? I sure hope nothing moved. It exported! Just apply transforms. That's a funny idea. And probably a terrible idea. PSSDL38RGB undeclared. PSSDL38RGB undeclared. Okay. Real spot finder. I see. I see. Well it exported. We did it. We have waterfall loop. Right. Okay. I'm getting a ton of ads. I'm getting a ton of ads. What the fuck? How even? How even? How even? That's slightly moved. At least that's moved a lot. Yeah let's move to start mark 2. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. It looks like... Okay, your base does have an old version with the skull, I just realize. Okay, your base does have an old version with the skull, I just realize. Okay, your base does have an old version with the skull, I just realize. Okay, your base does have an old version with the skull, I just realize. Okay, your base does have an old version with the skull, I just realize. Okay, your base does have an old version with the skull, I just realize. Okay, your base does have an old version with the skull, I just realize. Okay, your base does have an old version with the skull, I just realize. Okay, your base does have an old version with the skull, I just realize. There are rotated. There are rotated. Yup. You see how the color changed? Yeah, quite a few bugs here. But we can fix it. That was huge compared to Mario. Yeah. Is it supposed to not be? Also it looks like... Also it looks like... The first 64 preview was the one where you actually get it in the game. The first 64 preview was the one where you actually get it in the game. I guess it was because there wasn't any color being used here. I guess it was because there wasn't any color being used here. That's why the colors went crazy. That's why the colors went crazy. This is why we don't put nth color in the combiner. This is why we don't put nth color in the combiner. It looks really cool still. It looks really cool still. Yeah. But we gotta fix the bugs. But we gotta fix the bugs. Another one. I think I'm just gonna switch to I think I'm just gonna switch to much more accurate and it saves time. Yeah. This one uses end color too. I guess I already fixed it. I guess I already fixed it. Stop doing that Fast64. That whole thing here is black. Let's see. Let's fix. Is it just the UV issue here? I think it's a multi texture scale issue. Because that's the one thing that the normal Fast64 renderer does very wrong. It's the multi texture scale. Oh, I see. Wait, is that it? Did I fix it? Or is this still wrong? Jumpstitch is too large. I suppose that's this one here. What size stripes do we want? I've been pressing too many buttons. Okay, I'll wait here until I have the verdict. This one, okay. Yeah, this is also what looks correct to me. Yeah, so Fast64 renderer is the more accurate one, unless it's about transparency, I guess. And the pipe. Oh, that's powerful. Okay, that still looks wrong. And the inside of the whale bar still looks wrong. And that texture still scales with inf color. Yeah, you need to actually install the plugin too, otherwise it's not going to appear. Okay. Like, on your end, it messes up all of them, instead of just none of them, like on my end. So some are worse for you. Getting zero, unbelievable. Well, unfortunately, if they're messed up like that, it means I need to fix them. That red coin at the beginning seems really easy to miss. Oh, I'm pretty sure I shortened this part by a lot before I sent the file off. Shit. I think this is an issue of you having worked off a slightly old version. Because it's not supposed to be that long. I do like the new red coin collection effect, you see how I changed it? What's wrong with this climatic? Yes. But you know what players kept doing? It looked like this. And it's like, I can't stand this, I can't do that. Am I supposed to walk on this one? We can test it! Like, I don't have to reset it, we'll test it. Well, that shot has some issues too. Oh my god. Okay, I just kept falling into the floor, it's slightly problematic. Okay, this is just for the star at the end then. I see. That looks so low FPS to me. I still don't know when I'm gonna do that. I'm a bit worried that this red coin at the beginning is too easy to miss, so I think we should do something slightly different here. I still think the concept of comeback once you have the ice cap is good. But not higher than intended. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. What is this? You put the ice cube over here? Hello Xericlum, thank you for the happy birthday. What is this part? This is the ice cap. Let's just make a separate layer for all the animated water. It will waste a little bit of performance, but it's fine. What are these two textures? Okay. Let's see how this looks animation wise. I speak a little bit of Latin. It means happy with the many years case. Greetings out of Venezuela. Am I right or am I right? Alright, that sounds good by the way. That's probably the easiest way of doing it. The wave material probably has to be a lot faster. But how does this look? Is this closer to what we want? I'm going to put these into 60 FPS because right now they're 30. I'm also going to scroll a bit faster. Like I said, I'm going to make them 60 FPS so they're going to be twice as fast. Still need to rework that whirlpool there. Do you know of the UV distortion tech for waterfalls? Are you using that here? Well, like the further along the waterfall you are, the more you stretch the UVs. Was that factored in here? Not at all. Maybe I am stupid. But this one here especially could use some of that. Ah! Maybe like so? Wait, isn't that the opposite of what I'm supposed to do? Yeah, this is the way. I think you did it the wrong way around. You did it the wrong way around. Thank you for the birthday wishes. You have to think about the shorter your UVs, the faster it will go through them, right? Who the fuck's calling me? Oh, it's my mom. One second. Hello? Thanks, I'm streaming right now. Yeah, people can hear you right now, so don't say anything stupid. Yeah, now I'm really old. Yeah, there was chocolate cake and... Yesterday! They always celebrate... If it's Sunday, they celebrate the day before, that's what they do here. Yesterday? Who was on the road yesterday? Yeah, after that we celebrated. I don't want to disturb you. Yeah. Have a nice day. Alright. Bye! Alright, let's just finish this up then. We need animated water. Let's just name this AnimatedWater. We're gonna give this a new function. GeoAnimateScapWater. Hmm... Why don't we have this behavior here? Here. This one is 80.57. How did you compute that? It's your mom's favorite assembler. I fear she does not know assembly. That's embarrassing as it is. As long as she knows C. Of course she knows C. Why wouldn't she know C? Come on. Everyone knows C. Okay, I said it was Jesus. He was in Carpenter. Bro is scoring big points right now. Okay, there should only be three materials on this, right? Two materials! Oh my god, my life is so good and awesome. Meow meow meow. Okay. You know how sometimes the music in RTYI sounds god awful? Well, Sauron figured out why and it looks like he has a bugfix for it, which is great. Does she have xpoint of storage? That's not known. Okay. So we need to look for the set tile size comments. I'm so glad they're different. There's only one here? There's only one texture here? Okay, well, that's even easier for me. Nice. Wait, why isn't this bleeding? This should be bleeding. Weird. Concerning. Tempo is gfx3. This is gfx4. This is gfx5. Oh, I know why it exists. It's because we have the tile scroll here. Oh, this is problematic. As soon as we remove it, that will be gone. Okay, we might just have to accept the bleed. Well, I don't want to just accept the bleed. We'll do this. That should preserve it. I actually don't know. I haven't decided that yet. I forgot what we had them set to. One is S, the other is T. This should be S, and I think we had S set to 0 in the first material. So we want this to be... Oh my god, why didn't I remember those? Fuck. This material is only T scroll, so we only need to do scroll with vector tool. Let's just do them in order. Everything will be okay. We had it set to 4. No T scroll, no S scroll. We have S scroll on this. We had it, I think, set to 1. T scroll, I think, was set to 2. And then this one, I think, was set to minus 1. But only on the S axis. That sounds like it makes sense to me. Okay, we should have beautiful 60 fps animated water now. That is the completely wrong level. Okay, most of this is animated now. I would say this is maybe a little too fast. But as I know it in the middle looks mostly fine. Maybe slow it down a little bit. But yeah, those are too fast. The tornado is set to 4. Let's set it to 3. Maybe 2, actually. I see. I'm just gonna extend it this way to slow it down a bit. And this one doesn't seem to do anything at all, actually. Oh my gosh. That's why. Okay, okay, okay. We're almost there. I'm gonna have an Mario game. No idea. That's an emulator bug. The emulators restarted itself and that's not sometimes. Why is the fish so angry? There we go. That's a fucking screenshot. Alright, I think this is a good place to take a break. Since we didn't have a game original, this is original. I just made this up and then Biobank made it better. I will see you guys in the next stream, whenever that is. Bye bye!
