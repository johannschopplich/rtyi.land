Oh Hello Where are my fellas Oh Hello Selton congrats on being the first person in chat Hello bio back congrats on being the second. Hello. Sam was found or Kim I Think jumping between these is gonna be pretty easy. You can even just walk between these Meowty And Video and then Nivelle Delbarco, okay, whatever, bro Looks like it does look like Mario So I kind of spent the last two weeks Working on this level here importing biomex things Wait, what's it the last two weeks on the last week? I don't actually know And I think it looks pretty good I Said the people that made us we're supposed to rooms can be playable. No How would my roms ever be playable on X co-op like unless they bundled with a fucking emulator Yeah, dude, I love this the fucking moon up there. Oh my god, this is so sexy I'm gonna be cheaper to use police instead of a texture for lighting. Yes. I think so. I actually tried it But I couldn't make it look good I Also made it so that red coin stars don't put you out of the stage anymore, I think that was a necessary change What's up? Lily Lila, are you calling me Casey? Casey is crazy true Oh Look at this. Okay. Are you guys all ready for like the most amazing scene ever? Boom? I Fucked it up. What happened? Because it's using in color god damn it I fucked it up You're just gonna have to trust me that this looks really good It would look really good if I didn't fuck it up Okay, any OST wishes for today Think this actually doesn't have to correct or have its handle the other way for death audio off players. I See the point you're making yeah You know what since we're working on a cowboy level I feel like this song is very fitting The crazy part is the game doesn't look like it can run on an N64 but it does There's no way yeah, I know what you mean by a bank Wait, don't deaf people also feel vibration still I feel like deaf people can figure it out just from the vibrations I I Don't you can feel vibrations from the headset Okay, it's difficult with headphones you're right Hmm Yeah, I don't know what Beethoven did I feel like Beethoven might be an exaggerated story because it just seems so unrealistic Mark could look at the right door, but not the other ones Yeah, yeah that kind of works but how would a blind person figure a deaf person figure that one out Like how would they get the hint Okay, so what we're gonna do is there's gonna be the shy guys here they're gonna run off and then oh, yeah Zena Then you make milk bottles. I need them We need milk bottles So The shy guys are gonna jump in here and then new track minecarts are gonna fall down and you're gonna jump with those It's a very challenging, okay. No, no, no, of course, it's not a challenging game it is Kirby Odyssey did it for one of those puzzles and then approved I see I see I Do we have any OST wishes today my mom is not Kirby It is mr. Comet this whole thing is a homage to your work Your work on the game Mario party I Mean to us T. Let's do it When I think of marijuana haven't played it I don't like to the game store, so Okay We got that next we need the shy guys that run around I think I want all of these to be the same species Actually, I want them all to be snifits. I Think this guy that wants to sniff it. Yeah I Came ugly life you consider that I simply do not care about having a clean house Maybe that's why I shouldn't clean because I do teachers don't care. I think it is a waste of time When I lived in Germany, I just had like a cleaning lady that would come by and I wouldn't clean myself It is a lot cheaper to just do that The Most amazing thing we made is dino dino lens. That's an interesting favorite, but I do like it a lot Lila I think you should give me 600 euros Or that reminds me I'm I'm getting PayPal cocked they refused to let me use my PayPal money Anyone got an idea? I'm well, I mean I can use it I just can't send it to anyone can only use it on eBay and steam as far as I know Maybe other websites too, but I can't send it to myself So anyone got an idea on what I should do with that I was thinking buying CS go skins but The steam workshop has like a 15% markup, so I don't want to waste all the money Treat up one and Cooper Carnival interesting At them in public on Twitter that honestly might work Sending my I don't have a landlord. Mr. Comet. I Have a fucking house It's my well, it's not technically mine yet, but Yes, you do, okay All right, I like how shady these guys look What lighting conditions do we want here we probably want this to be a pretty dark cave, right I I am NOT a ransom. That's true. I do not have a lunch Dude I actually looked into Twitter monetization today It looks like if I could monetize my Twitter account, that'd be like $200 a month Just for posting stupid shit on there The problem is I only have a million impressions in the last three months and you need five million So I'm thinking we need to go all out on Twitter I'm thinking I should hire a social media manager Okay, Lila the incel belief is that girls cannot be in cells so you cannot be a girl cell, I'm sorry Hi, are you Interesting idea I Think we should just post like updates of the video game We can even just like what if we just made like a hundred videos and we posted one of them every day and then we Just cycled through them Here's your resume you have one like bro 71 views They say that ants can survive being margaret's by my aunt it didn't okay, I get it It's not funny, but I get It's better if you pronounce it aunt and well, but it's pronounced aunt no, I Ever gonna team up column with then GP TV. I Mean I know dance very good at what he's doing, but I don't see a reason for us to call up There's a really anything we can contribute to each other other than sharing knowledge, which is what we do already So you have to make $1,000 a month after getting five my impression service you assuming and get five times the money You would probably still be losing money Honestly, wait, why would I pay them better? Twitter blue is like $5 a month. So we would be making $995 a month Or do you mean the social media manager? Well Social media manager is not a full-time position. It would just be someone who posts once a day. I Would hire them like based on a revenue sharing thing. That's what I like to do I Plan to do more of those videos I have a video planned about like unused features on the n64 that would have made retail games a lot better There's very tough you could watch with the screen off that's like a podcast I Could you schedule a tweet I don't have my youtube. Yeah, you can schedule tweets You Reverse necromancy you kill people But isn't necromancy just like temporary when you have to also revive them when you just turn people into Jesus basically No, I haven't played and then I don't plan to play it I don't really see a reason to play it First necromancer is just a paladin. What does a paladin do? You Can't tell people that what you're gonna do is a spoiler because then they won't click on it Making level previews on YouTube is just not a good business model. I have to make technical videos, unfortunately They Smite the undead what? Oh On Twitter She smites was already dying. Oh, so you just kick someone while they're already on the floor I see Maybe you do the deserve to be bullied Leila Engine technology licensing the license your engine pitches for thousands of dollars It wouldn't buy that Hello Rionna, bro Bro is coding. Hello, Nata The only thing I wrote a written in a minor how much longer are you a minor I Will scan you all my bullying tweet for eight months from now It said that the policy story make wasn't DMC 8 he just cancelled it himself People pretend like there was some sort of an overcomable obstacle But no, they just told them that they can't encourage his work And he lost motivation because of that don't make it sound like valve came after him And Everyone younger than me as a kid and everyone older than me is too old I'll be real if you weren't born the same day as me. He's just over for you Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna have them run to what's a point here and then to what's their minecart Each One's gonna go into a different minecart So we need that be param one to decide which minecart they're going to this one's gonna go to minecart one this one's gonna go to a minecart one and he's the one that talks and This one's gonna go to minecarts zero Next time you see GM in life, you should go wish him a happy 20th birthday Isn't this birthday in December Yo, thank you for the sub reorder brah He's not 20 30 holy shit He's 19 Oh god, the area center is here. Okay, this will be hard to estimate. What if we just take this guy and be like, this is a good 792 coordinates. So if you take the snippet Shoki location, we should get it, we just have to wait for it to happen. We don't need Z. Wait, we don't need Y, because this is the fucked up coordinate system R64 uses, I forgot. I'm actually a Z-up guy, because Z-up is more optimal. Fun fact. So we take this minus 792. To get a magnificent 7, what is that? Okay, what B-primes did I give these guys? Oh, nice captaining bot, glad you like it. And yeah, I think it's not good that they boot you out. I actually feel like, okay, the thing is, I think it'd be nice to have a Mario game where stuff like that doesn't boot you out at all. But that is a very limiting design thing, because that means we can't have linear section that end in something without having like a weird warp back, which I don't want to do. So, I only make it so that some stars don't boot you out, and the red coin stars were just a really easy one, because they were easy to mark. No we can't, so for the reason I literally just explained, were you listening to me? That's true Leela, it's very sad for you. You can't do anything, because you're a miner. I usually get red, so I'm getting 100 coins, there's no 100 coin stars in this game. So, it's still two. I don't think 100 coin stars should be in this game. Red coins don't boot you out? Well, if they existed in the game, they wouldn't boot you out, that is correct. What the fuck are you guys talking about? Dude, what the fuck is going on with my hands today? Is it because I was out in a cold earlier? I can't fucking type anymore. Am I offset from a keyboard? There we go. How are regular coins going to work then? There will be a global coin counter basically. Wait Leela, you smoke weed? Like actually? Damn. I don't think that's good for you. You don't? Okay, good. There needs to be an action for hopping into minecarts. Medically prescribed ones I see. I kind of just gave up on doctors. I feel like doctors nowadays are just so bad that going to them is not really worth it anymore. Every time I went to a doctor recently, it's just been worse for me. Or they have given me advice that it's just stupid. I had a problem with my elbow and the doctor told me to just take cortisol or something. And that would have been terrible. It's much better to actually do a proper physiotherapy and fix the underlying problem instead of just injecting a fucking medicine into your elbow. How do I get girls to give you the bank details? I feel like if you're a really good looking guy, you might be able to be a romance scammer. Maybe you can use a fake profile of a guy. You just find someone who will fall for that. I also had to wait three hours at the doctor's. And then he just prescribed me cortisol instead of physiotherapy, which would have solved the problem. Which I then did, which solved the problem. I went to a Canadian doctor. Well, I also went to German doctors before. They're not any better. Dude, I had an injury with my wrist. My German doctor told me, yeah, just take painkillers and keep working out. That didn't work. Why would that work? That's such a stupid idea. I don't know. Hello, user. Hello, user. Ex-user. Yeah, exactly. Simpson fan. The worst part is I listened to her for two weeks and it fucked up my wrist. I actually can't bend my wrist fully anymore without it just being in pain always now. Okay, right. We need to set the physics. Actually, I like some bounciness on here. Trust me, I'm a doctor. Yep. Yeah, all of this is working as intended, I think.  One thing I really don't like about this is that the door is letting the camera through. I feel like doors should never let the camera through. This is what I'm looking for. No safety. Okay. Surely there's a third way. Keep in. Why is the hexagonal mesh collision? What the fuck? Why is the hexagonal mesh collision in segment three? It makes no sense there. That's a really weird decision. Probably an accident if I had to guess. Oh, what is that ungodly noise? What the fuck is Xena doing up there? Okay. Their jumps kinda work. Oh my god, Xena, shut up. This is so annoying. Why is she doing this to me? I was like a lawnmower. Yeah. We don't have a lawnmower, though. Hello, Micron online. Yeah, we are working on making impressive shit happen. Oh god, it finally stopped. No, it kept going. Oh, okay. That's nice. That's nice. We're getting there. Okay, that looks really cool. We do need that camera setting. There's actually a cool feature in my engine here that allows you to set the camera angle on level entry. So we can just always have the camera be there like this. Oh god, she finally stopped. We're safe, guys. Not 192, but probably like 180 for left. We're safe. And then we just make it so that the minecart follows the track. What does Mario look like? He spawns in a void. He doesn't. Don't worry. Why no compiler? Approach F32 symmetric. Oh, whoops. Okay. What should I say? What's wrong with being a grown-ass man? No compiler. That's Latin for I don't compile. I'm sorry. I'm so old. I spoke Latin. I believe you. Thank you. That's Italian, not Latin. I'm not sure how to respond to that. How did I call this? Minecraft spline. Yo, thank you for the sub. Never around. Do I not have TTM included here? That's crazy. You have cat memes, Remnant? Huh? Maybe you do. I just say, hey, and you think of a cat meme? Unbelievable. I didn't even know there was a cat meme that goes, huh? Gaslighting what does that mean you're making up words again? Hello Aras here, please don't speak other languages in this chat Not because I don't understand them but just because I find it really fucking annoying and I can't understand them Did you just respond to the Spanish guy Leela not beating the Spanish allegations Idiot why does the stream have the gargoyle tech gargoyle on these and that's So to go for German I find that less annoying but it's still annoying Let's see how this goes I should just go till the end and then do random stuff I don't know Pablo they're being really annoying oh I got the rotation wrong I think Let me try 0x80 So this part works well and they also oh god yes this is still the wild west C is super easy this is like the easiest language ever actually that's probably easier ones but still Like this is almost plain English right you just say oh move angle jaw approaches something symmetrically it approaches goal angle from this by 0x800 that's that's it like you can just this is a sentence and this is a sentence too Now why did I go into such a weird pattern I'm just gonna ignore chat until it's good again Hmm Is a hundred too little don't think so well that wouldn't even make a difference Does subh not need to zero also not true Hello pizza meat Is the path not correct I guess it's getting the wrong value What if I do this because it might have been like that that's a void pointer and somehow that's being interpreted as like a u8 size thing Pickle Okay interesting They are following the path they are following the same path that's to be expected We can still increase the speed if we want that's no big deal Deja vu I've been in this place before And now they're gonna go crazy Why did you start meowing because I didn't know the words What do you do when you don't know the words to a track You go la la la la la that sounds stupid I'd rather go meow meow meow meow You bark that works too So we're gonna mark at the end of the track like this So Yeah that is also fitting I am singing in yogurt Where the french the real yogurt meals all along Is it no longer the rarest kind of meal You guys gotta get on that quark shit zero percent fat no flavoring just quark That's not crypto that's food No quark Yeah this is so disgusting but it's pure protein So I'm gonna take 8.5 The new background sounds I don't know I don't know what you're talking about Are you hearing zayna upstairs? Is she being loud?  Guys do you believe in the probability waves that quantum mechanics suggests or do you think they're hidden variables Then we can still find theoretically Yes and interesting Eh I think this should probably be like the end of the track How much to the side do they go? 375 units I would say Track width 375 As long as it gets your first computer you do not care I don't think quantum computing will be real for the next 100 years Oh well it's gonna be real but it's not gonna be useful And these tracks were trained on minecart So a minecart you should add a bunch of warning signs at the end of it Yeah it's for minecart Hello Yoshi party Oh there's an issue here Because this is not how it works I was thinking we would just offset this to the left and the right and then it's gonna work But there's a problem here We need to offset it by the angle to the next track piece KZ made quark would I become big and strong like my idiot KZ manual and would I vomit? You wouldn't become big and strong but you might vomit Goddammit Lila I forgot these So Kog is nasty Zeyna doesn't know what's good Dude can you believe it? Zeyna eats tomato soup Would you listen to someone like that? Oh god You know what? It works I just didn't do the thing Oh It's their floor that doesn't update So do you buy yogurt or make it yourself? I don't do it either Eating handfuls of netherrack for the protein I don't know what that is but it sounds like I would As soon as I get 50 Dude That's just quark with milk That's gonna be so nasty Fun fact I got kicked out of my old apartment Because of the cumshank Or my landlord was very upset I used to make the cumshank every night And then I got kicked out of my old apartment   At like 12 at midnight And I just drink it And she would get upset Because I was eating my cumshank at 12 She was my downstairs neighbor Can you make It's a very easy recipe You just take quark 250 grams You put it in with like 150 ml of milk Or maybe 200 You shake it in the mixer and you just drink it up It's not bad Honestly It's a very filling Dish So instead of track width We want multiple way We want this There are also 180 degrees rotated Right? That's fucked up Didn't I rotate All of these at the same time I did this I did this I did ctrl.rz180 Why is it saying it's rotating Them and then Why are they not rotating Huh Why does this turn on Ctrl. Ctrl. turns this on How Ctrl. Is supposed to Turn this on Individual elements Why does Ctrl. Not work anymore When did that break Okay We can't all Redeem cumshank at the same time At least wait until I'm back on the bulk Okay It looks a little Jumpy But it seems to work I kinda like how they split up like this From the tracks being different lengths It is pretty fun looking And then They come back together Nice I know Oh yeah I didn't tell you guys I changed a few sounds Listen to this I just realized Here are the new sounds I want your opinion on these First of all We got a new ground pound jump sound It's from Mario Kart 64 I know it's a bit weird at first But you get used to it And you suddenly like it Sounds out of place The stomp is too short I agree on the high pitch To high pitch that's a good point uh sound mario press i do like the new sounds but i think they are a little bit improvable then we got the spin jump here i think this is very fitting because this is like the voice user to melee which is with the mario 64 voices i'm also going to give him the melee spin jump animation here and then one change i made just because i thought it was funny is the falling sound listen to mario's falling sound now wait that's not it why did it not play wow god damn it playing in its entirety it's a bit longer it's good but it needs to start a bit early it looks like i agree it sounds like it's cut off at the beginning but this is actually the sound in melee oh that's too low so it does sound a bit weird wait that's the eeha no one that sounds weird i was supposed to pitch down the okidoki so let's try this it's still high pitched oh yeah maybe the furnace needs an emote should use the crisp red one no dude zana you were so loud earlier you were at the furnace earlier okay what can we do about these jittery motions what if we decoupled the face angle from the move angle a little bit so yeah zana let's sort out that's very bothersome that's true it is theoretically possible to cancel it but i mean most ways to cancel the fall damage are just gonna make a sound anyway oh that looks way better look how much smoother that is it doesn't look weird at all anymore to me i think we actually should just be like move angle draw equals goal angle no turning so he stays properly in the lane hello salamiero oh yeah look how nice they stay on the rails now kind of it is kind of rough actually oh but i guess that will be fixed once we actually move the roll to the surface terrain should add warning signs at the end of the track yeah probably okay this is still we're just programming it for now we're not even doing the visuals yet i don't think it's that jank i think it's just because we need the rotation to be smooth we can't have it be instant  right next is the roll and pitch this should probably be a function i'm gonna make this a function so i am actually even gonna no point to check this i know rarely i do that but this time i think it makes sense because objects having no floor pointer is valid behavior  align to fine fine i'll fix the typo yeah what the fuck is going on to mario what the hell what is going on with mario something's very wrong with mario the hell what did i do to mario yeah i can move normally again i'm holding forward here i'm not doing anything how can this be this is very worrisome oh yeah biomeg you're like the first person is this what you wanted i think it's good check the code i don't think that this is bizarre like this shouldn't be a code thing hmm show me again sure let me just get in here so yeah i think doing it like this is perfect right it actually looks like you're going into mario's hat this way okay somehow the align to surface function is doing this oh what the fuck i see what i did wrong i accidentally left the line about the camera in here so so so yeah but i would have to make a copy of ryan's shield layout that can actually be transparent which i don't have so we have to go with the cutoff i don't think the cutoff looks bad so it's fine there we go no z is the long jump button all right i think we should make them a little bit faster let's go with 60. one first person now you have a stick you can look if you want to go slower this is actually an amazing thing they invented this in 1996 and there are still games out in 2023-2024 that don't use this but there's this crazy invention they did it's the joystick if you press the joystick slightly your character or your camera in this case moves slowly and if you press it fully it moves fast many people even game developers do not know of this trick but it is something that you can use to make your game feel a lot better so so the analog stick doesn't actually always have analog movement you actually need to program that into your game as well no ramoback support now i don't have a ramoback so i don't have a way to test it so so what is a vos that's a good question actually  what is a vos where's the guy called scott the boss so it was inspired by a strategy game that fucked up the stick movement yep they didn't add stick movement i was the one that complained about this you probably heard this here first no people actually didn't complain about that at all on kevboard as far as i could find which is crazy to me the thing is i think people are just such bad gamers that they can't tell when their analog 3d platformers don't have analog controls it's like serving a soup full of piss to people that just have never had good food in their life they're not gonna notice it's full of piss i don't know if that analog holds what's in the manual it's usually just a word i made up it doesn't mean anything um says the guy who asked for the tuna shake hey the tuna shake very good for your muscles hello mayo sunshine so are you sure it's the joy-con stick and not just games on the switch because okay the thing about the joy-con is it doesn't have notches so when you make a game that is designed to run on joy-cons you need to software emulate a big notch so people can actually consistently hit at least the eight directions on the sides so i don't blame the joy-con controller itself i actually blame the lack of notches for the lack of analog you got an ost request claimant pay soup as much protein to yeah it would have more if it was without the piss like you just said i'm not sure why i'm speaking yeah i think that's the issue i'm sure people have requested never gonna let you down before yeah you don't need notches at consistent angles if your stick is good i don't think so because even the way you're gonna hold it is gonna mess up your positioning it's gonna be a lot harder to hit the directions consistently without notches this is definitely a cowboy song fuck it's hard to keep up with them now that they're faster they're supposed to just fly forward at the end they just bounce why are they not slowing down all right good cowboy music oh i know why well this is certainly an issue this should do it now um we also want there to be minecarts for mario to jump on i just don't think records are very creative i i can't find the joy in them isn't the point of the human experience to have creative expression isn't that what makes us unique then you choose Mr. Rickroll, does your life serve any purpose? Mustache man is his third name. Funny yahoo man is going to come on screen again in a bit. By the way, what's the update on it? What do you mean by the way? What's the thing we've been working on all stream? We need new minecarts to drop in from above here. I guess we can just place them down here and they drop in after these run off. I think that should work. That's yep. How does that work long ways? I can't what? Struct object has no member platform it does. I guess it's stored in the Mario state now. Chaos thing. Have dryable lighter type no. Can they jump in what the fuck? Interesting. Right, I can't run these functions here. I have to do it differently. Metal bonk? No. I'll try metal pound. That is, by the way, not the actual text they have. What the fuck? They came back? What was that? They just came back. Why did they come back? I need to see this again. I've got a few issues here. Did they just fall off? Hmm. This should probably be 8 instead, because we subtract 4 here. Oh. I see what happened. They were turning each other into cards that fell from the top over and over. Things were fucky. Hello, Hedgehog Gamer. It's going to be a bit difficult to switch between minecarts like this. I just want to die when he gets hit by falling minecarts. Nope. But he probably should. Where did the other two go? What? I feel like they're going to be here. Nope. Oh, yes. Game over. I feel like the second cards should be faster. I think every variable should be global, right? Let the children write to memory. They yearn for it. I'm just going to use a BPM4 to make these go a little bit faster than the other ones. Because if you make these a little bit faster, what's going to happen is that they will catch up slowly. Which I think will look very nice. Also, fuck it. If you get squished, you get squished. It is what it is. Actually, now that I think about it, I don't think this is good. We wanted to program this at first because we wanted to see how this would go. We're going to probably have to pivot into a different Minecraft section. Because right now it's going to be very difficult to actually invade the Shy Guys. Nope, I have no news. I'm FedEx-free. Yeah, I already have Glass Textures in. Don't worry about that. Okay, so they wait for Mario. Nice, nice. How and why did I fall off? Mario falling off? Very, very bad. Might be related to these. That should be a little bit better. What the fuck? This is better. Okay. I made a Moomoo Label and used a London Mill Label from the media because it's the only one I could find. Oh, that's fine. Why not make Minecarts flat? Having walls just makes things awkward. I'm not sure how making them flat helps. I don't see the difference here, August. Oh, you mean the top flat. Yes, the top is flat. Nice, Mario didn't fly off. Okay, but swapping between Minecarts is really, really difficult. Holy shit. I can't expect players to do that. How do we make this better? Oh, actually, it's not that bad. Oh no, they caught up too quick. I'm just going to make up random bullshit numbers here. The track could be straighter. What if you had the minesweeper tomorrow when you jump? Well, there's inertia. We don't want that to be just one weird special mechanic here. I actually kind of like that at the beginning you don't have to jump. Because they're going to be too far away. But then after a little bit, it does make sense to jump. So in that sense, this already works. The problem is here. We could make it so that they only shoot at you on the straights. The issue is the corners mess everything up. Hmm. Hello, Hoshi. No, you're late. And Lila isn't here. Damn. What are you going to do without your favorite chat? Marfa has all the animations. Nice. I mean, I'm just going up and I don't know what you mean by up and down. Let me figure out why they crash to. Oh, that should be actual for not five. That's one thing. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, I see. Hmm. We have the same issue if it's with slopes, I think. Is it me setting this to know that can't be? It should be just fine. The fuck? I think I have a better solution, and that is we're going to make them more close to each other. And we're going to do that by making the ones on the outside fast in the beginning and slow in the end. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Did I do it on all of them? Five, five. Wait, this one has a 10 here. Five, five. Okay, that should work. But are you? It's the stupid oven. It is so loud. Did I not close my bracket somewhere? God damn it. This is going to take forever to find. Oh, wait, I found it. Do you live in a submarine? Yeah. Yep, it's the heater. The heat that it's going to stop during the winter and after the winter. Soon, we no longer have to deal with it. Dude, are you like cooking something? Is that what's going on? Okay, putting them closer together kind of worked. It worked better for the ones in front. Oh, actually. Okay. Okay, now they're kind of running away. It's still crashing. Yeah, we are planning to switch to electric. It's finally stopped. I have an issue with this and that is that it is possible to jump into this too early. So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to forcibly make these late. Like so. I think this also should go in here. Actually this shouldn't go anywhere at all, actually. We should maybe also stun Mario for longer, so that the Shy Guys have more time to jump into this. Because I really want to prevent the player from jumping onto this. Also we had this one run away at the end. That's not good. Maybe 5 was too high a value here. Or maybe 5 was too high a value here. No, I think it's this one here. Wait, I should have added the 5 here, not here. That's the issue. Does that make sense? No it doesn't. Goddammit. I just need to reduce the 5 to something lower. We got 5 and we got 5 and then this one needs to be like 3. Okay, there we go. And basically what these variables do is, they make the minecart go faster or slower at the beginning, so that they stay more in line with each other, so that it's easier to jump between them. If you have to live in a crossover right till the end of your life, what world will it be? What's a nice world to live in in RTBA? I guess Bunny Brushwoods isn't so bad. It's a pretty nice town. What the hell? Why did it kick me off? Let's also come out a bit too early. Oh, but now I'm worried that the player will just jump onto this track piece. Yeah, I think this idea for the minecarts is just not good. I think we need something else entirely. What if instead of three small ones, there's just one big one that you can walk around on? Like the Shy Guys are in their little minecarts and you're in one big one. Kind of works. No? You seem really bothered by this. Why does the minecart clip into the other minecart? That doesn't make any sense. Yes, it does not. We are working on it. 110 is also not enough. Let's do 120. I like one a lot more. It reminds me of the Bone Anointing Shadow Temple. Oh yeah, it kind of is like that. The problem is it's going to look bad. Unless it's one in the middle that's really big. Yeah, that could kind of work. We should try that. Let's try it. So we just kind of... It won't look something like that. That looks terrible. It's a thick minecart. It's not a minecart, that's a dinner plate. Well no one said it can't look goofy. Maybe it's a little too big. Honestly that's enough to dodge the attacks. I want to give this a try. You have an analog stick Captain Dink but that's all you will get. You should be able to do it with an analog stick. I'm a big analog stick fan actually. I'm a big analog stick fan. Goofy YouTube. Oh, the oven turned on again. No! Oven sounds like an industrial furnace, yep. There's nothing wrong with the cumshank. It is a perfectly nutritious protein shake. You guys knew how cold it was down here. Where's my minecart? Where the fuck is my minecart? Oh, it's here. Nice. I know what I did. Yeah, I just made a silly mistake of forgetting to put the behavior here. We need to find the culling radius. 5 on 4. 5 on 1 actually. Let's do 5 on 1. Yeah, it's just part of the game. We're going to ship this with moon jump, you know. For people that just aren't that good, you know, it's an accessibility feature. I'm going to build in a mechanic where if you fail a start twice, the game is going to take over for you and Mario is going to be controlled by an AI that will just beat the level for you. I want to make sure no one gets stuck ever. Luigi mode. We call it little brother mode, but you know, you are the little brother. Whoa. Okay, I see. What if we made the entire game just like not controllable? We just made a task that just beats the game. All you get to do is watch. Like instead of releasing the game, I'll just do a playthrough of the game and then the game comes with that built in and no other way to control Mario. And then I'll release it with a video just called I can play this cool game and you can't. Hey. Okay, I want the minecart to catch up quicker. So I'm going to turn this into 20 and then this is like the slowdown value at the end. So let's turn it into eight. How do we make sure the player doesn't just jump on the tracks and get squished here? That's the one thing I'm worried about with this idea that the player is just going to walk out and be on the tracks, which they shouldn't be. I guess we can have this be a cutscene. Now that I think about it, what if them jumping into the carts was just a cutscene? Disabled squishing, that's a terrible solution. Then get killed and learn a valuable lesson. No, that's an unfair death. We don't want that. And this distance is good so far. Okay, we need to close the distance faster. Otherwise, this is going to be lame. Yeah, okay. We definitely need to close the distance faster. Do you like to walk on the edge of a knife or making monster? Sure. I do that all the time. How do you guess? No, the only solution here is a cutscene. I'm pretty sure. It's very easy to make a cutscene. We'll just have a cutscene of the Shy Guys running away. Okay. This should do it. So what will happen now is that there will be a cutscene of them jumping into the mine carts. We can't move right now. That's good. I was able to move for one frame. That's not good. And now we're stuck here. Okay. Interesting.  Oh, I ended the other way around. Oops. I need this piece of code here. Okay. Do you guys think people said Yahoo before Mario did it? Miyamoto might legitimately have invented those. Oh, what the hell? Makes sense, too. I guess we need a sub action here. Wait, that's not what I want. This is what I want. Now? I'm pretty sure the Mario noise was first. Okay. The timing is good, but the cutscene sucked balls. Also, we're too fast now on this platform. Yahoo was made in 1994. When did Mario start saying Yahoo?  Wait, it needs to be 0xD0. There we go. No, it's turned on again. We live in agony today. It's usually not this bad. And the reason the card is white is so Mario can dodge the sniffing bullets. And the Hey-Ho guys would fall to their deaths. That's brutal. We want to arrest them, not kill them. Hey-ho! Oh, yeah. Makes sense. I wasn't looking. What happened? Why do I only fall off when I'm not looking? That is making this hard to debug. Okay, okay, okay. No, no, no, run! No! Okay, we're just a little bit too fast. And the middle one could use a bit of a speed boost. Okay, we need to fix the cutscene. The cutscene needs a different camera setting.   What if you just make the big minecart speed up function and distance from the shy guy minecarts? No. The splines are predetermined. The movement is predetermined. We can just change these values and then it will just work. We just need to find the correct values. Doesn't make sense to do anything else than that, I think. Okay, I feel like a good camera during this cutscene would be like... Here. And then you would just... Oh god, what? What did Blender do? Oh, okay. Do you work on low-level related stuff? What does it mean, low-level related stuff? Do you mean like assembly coding? C-assembly. I mean, I work on C all the time on my stream. And I program literally over a million lines of assembly code for my last ROM hack. Last Impact. But in my day job, I just use C++. You know what I hate? I hate when people be like, Uh, assembly? That's kind of high-level compared to machine code. And it's like, no, it's not. That's the same thing. There's a bijection between those two spaces. They are literally the same thing. Why do you pretend like there's a distinction? That's the case rant for the day. People say that just to be different. I don't even know why they would say that. No one is just programming in zeros and ones when assembly is literally just the same but readable. Oh, you're using paint to draw? Oh, you're just such a modern artist. I still type my numbers in the comments. Into a hex editor. Right, I know why. It's because I kept this object exported. Whoops. What you're suggesting doesn't solve any issue and is completely unrelated to what we're doing. Okay, actually, though, this is one thing that used to annoy me with the manual. It would just say, Oh, you need to set your status register. And I was like, the fuck? Just tell me the memory address. That's a weird cutscene still. I think we need to change the shape of the room here just to make the cutscene nicer. I feel like that is the correct player. We also need to change the voice line so Hoshi can stop typing. I'm making video games in Unreal Engine 5 Arc. I'm making the video game. Okay, nice. They're very aligned now. And I like that they kind of disalign at the end. Looks very cool. Hmm. It's only so low so you can go, is it not? Yes, but some people are like, No, there's even lower. You can type in zeros and ones, but they are the same thing. That's like... I don't know, it's pointless. You're still eating? Were you sleeping? Are you like an actual baby? Do you take afternoon naps? Oh, you were eating, okay. I don't know, dude. See, I haven't been a kid for a while. I don't know when kids stop taking afternoon naps. Maybe it's with 16, maybe with 15. When did they learn to speak? Like with six or seven? Lila has been conscious for like three months. She's wearing one of those propeller caps and she's eating a lollipop. That's what I imagine. Oh, okay. This is why my arc flew off. True, if you don't change the bytes on your hard drive with a magnet, what are you even doing? Okay, this one still crashes when it reaches the end, which is worrisome, because it really shouldn't.  Okay. Do you guys think that maybe with the advent of such easy AI voice training, a lot of people are just going to have fake exposes done on them? Someone's just going to fake voice messages from them? Oh, it's just a currently processed object, my claim. Yes, it's very easy to train an AI voice nowadays, Lila. A friend's done that to my voice yesterday. He just recorded 10 seconds of my audio and he had basically a one-to-one replica. Wait a minute, Lila. You already sound like a baby. I heard you. That's weird. He is weird. Yes. I heard your voice, Lila. Lila sounds like one of those anime girls. One gigabyte is going easy. I don't think you can do it in a week. Yeah, I got to hear Lila in a voice chat. Hmm. Okay, wait. First, let's fix the cutscene and then let's look at this. I think the cutscene could be better if maybe we move the camera over here. So it wouldn't go through walls anymore. So this one would need to be more like E0. And then maybe we reduce these. These by like 500. How's this 364? That seems very much centered. Maybe let's try this. Okay. Can you Nenzeh just showcase it with the ghost ship level? I can. I don't know what I'm gonna. Because we reworked it all now. I don't know if I want to showcase everything. Now Lila is absolutely a voice. Oh. Oh, it's because these walls have came back. Okay. Okay. That is easy to fix. It's gonna be so much better. All right. All right. All right. This has potential. Who's Technoblade? Is this one of those Minecraft YouTubers you guys like? I don't know why I said that. Okay. Wait, so he actually was a Minecraft YouTuber? Okay. That's sad. I thought it was just gonna be a random guy. Because people seem to not like him. But I guess. That is not what's going on here. Okay. How is it still moving for the camera? For the walls here? Do I also need no surf pack? I think I do. Okay. I indeed do believe I have a wife. Okay. 9000 plus lock? What is lock? This far? Okay. We have to move Mario a bit further forward. So that when he speaks to these in the cutscene. Dude, it's still doing that. What the fuck? Ow. Lines of code. Oh, I have some thoughts on that. What the fuck is going on with the camera? Why is this not working? I swear this used to work. Okay. I don't know real number. Probably like a few hundred thousand. Okay. Okay. I think we need to change the way this room looks. For the sake of the cutscene not clipping into this. To something like this. Okay. Okay. Take your stuff. Take it where? Your name is pronounced Casey. I thought it was Casa. Oh, you can pronounce it either way. Okay. I feel like there is a bug with the camera code. That makes it so that when you used to keep the camera in flag. It actually does the opposite. This is not used anywhere in code. Oh, these are. Okay. These are not. They are not flags. They're indices. So when we have both on, they actually turn into free. And free means it can always go through. So this is what we need. And then we need to change the door condition again. All right. So the basic chase works. We still need to make them shoot at Mario. And then at the end, we need to make them land on the platform. When they then fall down. Into this cave here. Not sure what to do with the cave yet. I feel like this is just going to be there for the visual. And that's it. I want to just check once more that the cutscene now works. That the camera is not going to look weird. And that they fall into the pit at the end. These are the things we need. Okay. The camera no longer goes through the wall. Perfect. Mario doesn't fall off. That's also very good. And then these are just going to shoot at you with you. Like walking left and right. You can even jump if you want. And they all fell in. I want them to fall a bit further forward. Yeah. But it works. Very nice. And we need more sounds. Either way. I think this is all for today. And I will see you guys next Saturday. Bye bye. Bye bye.
