See you two thumbs up.    Hello, B-Tark. Yep, it's a bonus stream. And we had a great Christmas. Christmas was fine. Hello Zena. Hello Tiger Jones. Nintendo Wild West songs. Hello Raishan. Hello Overlord. They are very different people today. Hello Cobalt Death. These two songs don't mix well. Hello Samguy. Yep, today is a bonus stream. It's what I decided. Hmm, I wonder if this is too difficult. I mean any half-decent player should just be able to jump over there. No, maybe not. I mean that's pretty easy to do. You could even do this. Or that. Oh, you can still Silly Kick in this game. I didn't know that. Who made the music for this level? Bad00p. He always makes the music for my levels. Nowadays at least. How many courses? 15. I like the animation of Mario that seems to be like a balloon that compresses and decompresses when it jumps. You mean the squash and stretch? I just made a- I don't know what are you asking specifically. I'll need to know more specifically what you want before I can answer the question. Struggle is here? Oh shit, Struggle! Yeah, Struggle. I stream on Twitch and YouTube at the same time now, because Twitch allowed that. Sweetie! Mario 64 had 15 courses, but they're all very small. So this is our plan for this level. We have no time today? No! Wait, Struggle! Before you leave!  I want to show you the level. No, you can't leave now! Don't you want to see what I made? Look, this is what we have so far. We have a milk bar, we have dolls that are shaped like a train, we have some windmills, tumbleweeds. We have the Koopa bank. We got a random house. The green boxes are going to be cactuses. We got the sheriff's office with a little jail. If you are a criminal, you're going to be outside like a zoo animal, unfortunately. This is a bit difficult to get up, I think. But you don't need to get up here. I might still just make a collision map there to make this easy. How cool is that? Look at the train! I love the train. Are you still streaming to Twitch? Yes. Can you rate my kill? Your gold kill? Your gold kill is... It's a bit small, so I'm going to give it a 9.8 out of 10. Family arguments on Christmas, damn. Mine was pretty fine, honestly. We played Smash Remix on Christmas. It was... Honestly, it's very charming, but it runs like dog shit and the music parts are bad. But it was still very fun. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Is Christmas paint open? Oh, no. Well, we used this as a guide. No, no, no. I didn't have family arguments. Someone else did. No family arguments at all. See you, Struggle. Bye-bye. Good luck. Hi, Mara. Thank you for the sub, Beta. You're welcome. It's because your nieces are annoying your parents so much. Oh, that's not a bad argument. That's a tame argument to have on Christmas. About nieces being annoying. Oh, come on. Unless your parents are all baby men. Hoshi!  Hoshi-loof. You're Jewish, so you didn't celebrate Christmas? Don't you celebrate Hanukkah? Wait, so do Jewish people not get Christmas presents? Damn, that's a good question. That sucks. Imagine you are like a Jewish kid at school and everyone tells you about their sick Christmas presents. And you're just sitting there like, hmm, I got none. What did you get for Christmas? I got a Mewtwo model kit and that's about it. Got some candy and shampoo from Zeno's mom. I'm an old man. Old men don't get Christmas gifts anymore. It is what it is. You also got a new jacket. Yeah, but clothing doesn't count. Clothing doesn't count as gifts. Guys, do you agree? 21, and you get Christmas as well? 27. They can't. What? No way. We got one agree. Can we get another one? Gifts are overrated. Okay. Oh, hello, Alter Gamer. Yeah, I was looking for playthroughs too. Clothing can, it depends. I don't know. I never cared about clothing. So for me, it's just... It's strange to see you in a shirt. I am only streaming shirtless during summer when it's way too warm. Stop talking like I'm always streaming shirtless. God damn it. You stream shirtless once for six months in a row and suddenly everyone branded you like that. My game of the year. I would like to give the game of the year award to no one. All of your games sucked. You found out about Kaze thanks to Skalox? Why? What did he do? Did he tell you not to check out me? Was it because my name is censored in his Discord? Is it the Streisand effect? The more you try to hide Kaze's existence, the more people find out about it. Look what you did, Zeyna. They're making fun of me. It didn't take 10 years to make a demo. It took 12. It's way better. Okay, but I don't want this to turn into a Skalox shit-talking stream. Honestly, I think it is best if me and Skalox just do not acknowledge each other's existence anymore. I think we both fare off better like that. 10 years is optimistic. Hmm. Dude, my streams are getting so many viewers recently. Holy shit. What happened, guys? Is it just because I started dual streaming? Oh, true. We got an air fryer. That's sick, actually. Oh. Best schnitzel in the province.  Zeyna schnitzel. You should talk to our people. How small are you? Oh. Oh, that's crazy. Well, I guess I don't really advertise my streams much, so it makes sense. Okay. I don't know what's going to be in F3 2024. So I had this idea for a ROM hack. This concept. I have this theory, and this is because I played Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom, I have this theory that games are just so goddamn bad that if you make a game that is just not offensive to the player, just like an inoffensive easy platformer with no frustration, no friction, just like easily solvable everything, people will fucking love it. So I'm thinking we should make a ROM hack. We'll have 10 levels, 20 stars on each. Stars don't boot you out. There will be some basic-ass stars. There will be a few creative ideas in there. And I think that would be the most popular game of all time. Or the most popular ROM hack of all time, rather. I think it would be that easy. And now that I've described the game, that sounds like Mario Odyssey. Hello, Leela. If your hands are cold, why don't you just warm them? So we want a big hoof iron here, a wheel, a shotgun, and a skull here. Odyssey is amazing, bro. Exactly my point. What do you consider? What do you consider? What do I consider of what? Whenever you ask a wood question, you need to provide the thing that changed. Because if I'm not doing it, then without anything changing, obviously I wouldn't do it. Just because I'm not doing it right now. I cannot understand your question right now. Your hands are always cold? Dude. That's such a woman moment. Looking spiffy as ever. Spiffy. Are you getting path tracing? What the fuck is that? So we got Wild West Valley because another name I had was Western Wilds. I think both of those names are terrible. If you guys have a name suggestion, I'm up to hear it. Also,   I just realized this is probably something we should do. We haven't made the star names or the intro cutscene for Oily Boily Bay. Maybe we should do that. We're doing that. Fuck it. We're pausing this level. We're doing the intro cutscene for Oily Boily Bay. Okay. I don't know what NFG D23 is. Remember Oily Boily Bay? This is how it looks. We got a few culling issues, but don't worry about those. Mighty Mesa? What the fuck is a Mesa? Cowboy Country. Ah. Yeah, that's more like it. The good, the bad, and the Yoshi. Let's do the star names in this one. That's what we should do. I'm going to listen to the level music while we do that. Oily Boily Mesa. Oily Boily Bay. What's the stars here? Troll the Bozo Troops. Right. Troubling the Troops? Trouble the Troops? Trouble the Troops. I think that I like that. Or something I can mess with the goons. Gooning on the goons. Goofing the goons? The first star is where you mess with everyone here in the level. Like you do this. And then he gets upset. Hmm. Is it in the Cowboy Country? Well, Cowboy Country is still a little too simple. The second star is the Minions are Striking. Which moves on Thwomp Workers and lets you use the cannon right here. Cannon shot to the crane. Something like that. Well, you demolish the statue. So you behead Bowser. Behead Bowser is a fucking wild mission name. Wild West Rango. That's not a Rango. That's the thing. It could also be a play on Outlaw. Outlaw Outlands. Oh. Outlaw Outback. High Noon Hills. It's a canyon. Cowboy Canyon.  This mission is about demolishing, right? Or well, you support the strike. Maybe. Oh, to support the strike is not really. I think the mission name should reference the crane. If it doesn't reference the crane, it's going to be too hard to figure out. Sea of Tiger Jones. Calamari Town because there's a train. Nah. Isn't it also Calamari? Vargin Vorman Valley. I don't know two of these three words. The crane and the cannon. Just because we need this to be a hint. Bowser sends his boss enemy to break this. Okay, the next mission here is the boss fight with the oil lark. Yeah. But it's about the strike breaker. So. I think just the strike breaker is a good name. Just because we also need this to be a hint. Some of these are a little cryptic. Next is platforming through the power generator here. Which is over there. Wanderer Wilds. Oh. Hmm. Not really a fan of that either. It's not really about wandering. Biobak said he would finish this area. So this is a little unfinished right now. We also still need a song. And some collision map here. And that's it.  Power plant platforming power plant platforming should work I think the next is the red coins on the air faults which is over here cowboy country is like to non-specific did you eight reds on scaffolds that's such a boring name I'll ignore that it says 0 these work by bitflex now that we haven't said so what's wrong with Walrus Wrangler we're just making up the finish for good level names because it's not a wrangle there's no wrangling going on here but this is bae vibes you know what I mean we're not about strict definitions we are about vibes no it's about pipes Lila one day you will understand scarlet scaffold scaffold I don't know about scaffold but scarlet scaffold something what's the word for a coin that starts with an s scarlet scaffolds gold no eight scarlets on scaffolds these are pretty quick names we might still change them later on oh then last is the 80 bit pipe that leads to the smash 64 level the 8-bit pipe is in the underground so we should probably reference the underground here whoops wrong game thing shackles isn't no shackles this is this bad I think that has a bad connotations this area is also unfinished and by the wants to finish it up yep it's a bonus stream it's kind of so fucking pretentious I just want the alliteration this is the level by the way I don't know if I ever showed this off I just noticed an issue here I forgot this wall we just added back see already in case you are a bit pretentious I am NOT I would never be pretentious that's actually an effect whenever you say something smart people call you pretentious for it fuck him anti-intellectuals go watch spider-man yeah this is bad the platforms so hmm what would be a fitting name I actually love this area and the platforming here is so cool it's the best insult all year dude and only a few days left but might actually win the insult of the year contest yes I can import directly from blender we have a plug-in for that code fast 64 it converts blender models to n64 models the pipe under the rig no bit pipe in the bay no a bit pipe underground I don't know it's gonna be fuck something's I'm actually based on either are you just making it look similar I'm just making them look similar playing the same level again doesn't smash 64 but in my 64 it would just fucking suck everyone would hate that making cool retro stage I already made this right now we're just thinking of a name for what the mission should be called where you actually have to do this this is one of the more difficult stars in this game oh there's another issue here I noticed two of them three of them holy shit smashing through the grates no it's gonna be hinting at the 8-bit pipe honestly not really at what you're doing here it's in the underground where you find that up here and definitely a pass leader what is more I have a t-pose double jump move he doesn't that's that's just my press L to levitate cheat code looking like that the other ones were called retro riddle second retro prime bird towns retro pipe the ancient arcades retro pipe the mountain retro pipe yeah how do you actually find this one I actually forgot where you find this fair horsey that's funny yeah you shouldn't take Leela serious ever elusive wall entrance you have to know single-circuit Mars movements yes not actually this is the engine room so maybe the engine room spit pipe okay these are just polymer names there's no guarantee that these will be in the final game now before we can move on to the western level we actually also need the intro cutscene and we need to sync it to the music so let's think about what would be good cuts for this that's the wrong level again it's hard to cut on this beat I think we should definitely like show the oil pump here I think this isn't actually maybe the camera being that way so I just run them at the moment what's the learning curve for making answer gives me too steep nah you can just make them I will add one and buy a bike did not make a new one yet I'm not sure what my my custom working on from is I want to pay biomic with paper money but people is not letting me use PayPal right now I don't know if he's actually working on stuff or not no hecka he just got it back up and there's no consequences to it Nintendo didn't actually sue him unfortunately what if the intro cutscene is like a pen like from here so maybe the pension start here and then actually I feel like the pen should show the bows are cutscene first like the bows are model the big bows are and then like go over here or no it should start at the building and then pan over to the buzzer cutscene that's we're gonna do then it's a voice chat or voice I don't know he does have kind of a high-pitched voice I think maybe I'm in but kind of why would I do that what kind of swearing I should be fast yeah exactly I agree so seen one show buildings move to statue okay I still need to buy fucking crypto pay crypto fees just to pay Biobak and then he has to pay crypto fees too and I can't properly do this like away from my taxes because now I paid on fucking crypto why not just fix the situation what like I'd literally just rather send them a bank transfer that'd be a million times more useful so that's hard to cut on any of this how long is this you would cut after the first two drums here I wait here hmm actually no it shows and okay I see what you mean show building 200 hearts is extremely high I can't be true so if the second scene just showed bozos face here did it did it did it did it and went like this then the third scene could just be like a pen over here the scaffolds and I think that would set the mood pretty well it's a short scene but it works let's try it yeah but you can't have a 200 Hertz voice I think I think that's just not I don't wanna I just want to make my games not interested in hacking some railway game that I don't even like so we need three cutscene splines in total oh what is this this one is a banger I'm pretty sure I know the song too oh my god I love this song what is this don't tell me it's fucking sky what sort I can't like a sky what's up it's deep in the ocean there's no seagulls here I do not care about perfect dark at all how can I obtain giga chat voice you're just gonna start talking like this you know the people on tick-tock to just pretend that that's their voice I'm Batman so stupid why does he talk like that okay I might actually I know why because he doesn't want to be recognized but it's still fucking stupid what's the complaint game completion code in this mud probably one of the boss fights with Welser okay we should have two garbage cutscene parts now but the first one should look fine I'm sure it's possible wrong level again right I forgot to make the cutscene play haven't played Mario Responder probably won't like it Oh, I forgot to link it up, god dammit. Oh, I forgot to link it up, god dammit! My dry world is level 11, which should be here. How do I know these things? The universe just tells me. Hmm, maybe this is a good card, actually. No, I think it's a bit earlier. Maybe at 30. Let's already get some splines for the second one ready, so we have two things to test at the same time. Below the oil, that's just gonna look buggy. No, no, it goes too slow. I'm thinking it should be like this. We have one very fast one first, then we have a slower one, and then we have another slower one. How am I gonna preview at a blender? How is that possible? Hello douche? Oh yeah, I recorded a video rating all my old romhacks, if you guys wanna watch that. I don't know when it's gonna release. The second one feels so slow. And I need it with the Bowser hat. Yes, it is one of my conditions that it fits on a normal N64 cartridge. I'm not gonna go above 64 megabytes. Technically, you can make your N64 cartridge more than 64 megabytes, but I'm not sure if I still consider cheating to go beyond that. The processing is too fast though, it cuts so fast you don't actually see what the camera is looking at. I'm not sure. Can I make a single rubble and animate that to visualize the timing you want before coding it in? It may be easier to set up the math that way. I didn't have to set up any math. I just need to set up splines. Okay, the first cut was too fast. I feel like what you're telling me to do would take longer than just doing it like this. That's nice timing. I think this one happened a bit too soon, maybe like three frames. This one happened, I think, also slightly too soon, but maybe just one frame compared to what it was before. And this one seemed perfect to me, but let's see it. What are the tweaks? Don't just tell me something's bad without telling me what's bad. There's like, you might as well just send me a message, I will kill you in your sleep. That's like the same vibe. Okay, the cutscene ends too early. And the second part, the third part is a bit weird, like this part is good, I think. This part should not skip the crane. This cut seems short, but I haven't seen the rest of the game, so just trust your gut. Okay, well, you have to think about the music. The most important part of the cutscene for me is that it's fitting to the music. So, which beat do we cut it on? That's the question. 50 frames on the first, but then that's cut to nothing. It needs to be on the beat. I'm gonna turn the music up so you guys know what the beat is. Wait, I want the first star so we see the bows ahead. So, all I want to change is that the last one is a bit later, so that when we cut back to Mario, it's on beat. And then I'm happy with it. Okay, the last part of this needs to be slowed down. Four and a half beats? I don't understand. I can't just cut it at any point, or I don't want to just cut it at any point in the beat. I cut it as soon as the music changes. Actually, I guess it's more like that. Wait, I'm gonna remove the first section. Nah, I like it. Hello, Papa Kappa. Case, do you think this is true? Study shows that playing Mario C might reduce depression and increase motivation. Unlikely. Maybe. When you read something like that, you also need to think about how much do people want it to be true. Because the more people want something to be true, the more likely it is they're gonna retweet that. I like this. Alright, we can go back to the cowboy level. What am I doing now? Homework. I'm doing homework live on stream, as you can see. That was on my to-do list. It is gone now. I'm gonna play Odyssey to fix some stuff. It's probably not even working, though. Selective settling is so easy to leave on accident. Maybe for some people in retro games, it helps because they play something toxic, like League of Legends. Yeah, League of Legends will definitely increase your depression, actually. I'm like 100% certain on that. Purely anecdotal, but... Did you guys know that Xi Jinping recently saved video gaming? They are banning a bunch of predatory techniques in China. So if you wanna make a video game that is gonna be published in China, you will have to adhere to a lot of things that video game companies will not enjoy. Is Ergon going to be that small? This one here? Yes, it will be that small. You could do what? What's wrong with it, Leela? What's wrong with having a small town? Does that mean no Cryptomining? There might be Cryptomining games. But no daily login rewards? I think there's some stuff against Pay2Win. I was on YouTube the whole time, but I can have access to better emotes? I do not know. I mean, if you are also an ad hater, you might prefer YouTube, because ads on Twitch are a lot worse. Games where they pay you to play and mines for them. Oh, that is kind of cool that that exists, honestly. Like, you are extracting money from Cryptobros with that. Keep that in mind. If you have a game that mines Crypto and you can play the player from that, you are making Cryptobros lose money. Just making sure you know that. So there is going to be a shotgun here, which I am just going to symbolize. Basically, this area here is going to be just some platforms to run around on. Then there is going to be a scavenger hunt. And there is a bunch of Wild West aesthetic things that are just lodged on the mountains. Are you involved in the development of Monster Hunter 64? I made the whole thing all by myself. You can ask Mr. Comet. First-time Purchase Discount Rewards, Chain Purchase Discount Rewards, Gacha Mechanics for Miners. Damn, that is good. I am not sure what a gacha mechanic is, to be honest. Because, like, are skins gacha mechanics? It seems like a blurry line. There will be a skull here that Zena is working on right now. So I am just going to mark it like that. Holy shit, China did something good. I also need colorful pipes here, and the pipes will lead to each other. Let me check what my normal pipe model actually looks like. Gachas, if you pay for something, you don't know exactly what you are getting. Oh, that sounds like gambling. But I guess you get nothing back, so that is why it is gacha instead of gambling. I am not sure what this is. Skins are only gachas, I don't know which one you get. Fucking lovely. I love that I don't have to attack just on here. Awesome. That is kind of awful. Doge. Do I not have a proper pipe model? Please tell me it is not true. Let me see. This might be in my conversation with Pyro J. Your pipes suck anyway. That is good to know. Let me check. Let me check. He sent me the pipe model a while ago. Oh, that looks really good, Zainer. I like that a lot. This is the skeleton, Zainer. The question is, how do we make pipes that look good and are high on poly? What did you miss? Nothing. There is no way this is the model. Nope, you will be shocked, Hoshi. I am sorry. Dude, I fucking lost the texture again. Again? After everything? I just realized I need to undo this. Time to give it lighting. It looks good, yeah. We can do this, I guess. If I have to. Let me get the texture first. How do my pipes look like? Look at them. Okay, so they have no explicit top shine. There is a set lights comment. That is disgusting. So this is CIA texture. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 32, 33, 34. 36 pixels. How is it 36 pixels? I am just gonna steal PowerJay's texture. I can't be bothered. What the hell? Okay, let's do this. Okay, file, external data, automatically pack resources. Please. I will literally just take the model you sent me and make that work. I think. I actually kind of like it. I think you might be right on this one. I think that Lila would be right on that. Bye Leela. No the pipes are all the same Pablo. Yes, the game will be open source. Yeah, I don't like that. What the hell? That looks bad too. How do we make this look decent? Texture-wise. I think that looks decent. And then we shade this flat. Yeah, yeah. Oh, hello full corn. It needs to be on the bottom part, I agree. Like so. No, it's actually native on N64. This runs all on N64, the whole thing. I have a bunch of video up on my YouTube channel about this too, if you're actually interested in the project. It's actually very cool what we're doing. And getting this to run on N64 is not an easy feat. That's kind of a sick looking pipe, I think. There's one problem here. It is bigger than the original because I messed something up. Why is it so small here? How do I get it back to normal size? I don't want to just estimate, but I guess I can use this as a measure. 322, 322, 322. Biggest is 205. Oh, that's the Z-axis. 154, 153. So 308, 308 is what we want. Circle 8, 154. FP, take this. Okay, that should be fine. Our new pipe. Let's see if it looks decent. I do still work for Gifts for Breakfast, actually. I didn't just used to work there, I still do work there. Why are these going to the side they shouldn't be? There's some flat shading on here when it shouldn't be. And there's some smooth shading on here when it should be flat shading. This is the 3D platformer, it's Mario 64, man. Yeah, those are some sexy pipes. Oh, wow. I do want the shine from the material that's inside on the outside as well. But I guess I can, actually I can have that. I need to edit the texture for that, the UV map. Does it really have to be like this? I guess that's fine. Wait, what the hell? Why is it not like this? That makes a lot more sense to me. And the inner part should probably be less UVs, honestly. Like so. Does that not make sense? Do you think the upper part is too big? Yep, it is actually, you're right. That's too short. That seems just right for me. Smart attitudes for Leela isn't even true. We dodged Leela. See, this is a common mistake in N64 games. The people that made N64 games thought if they just made their stuff low-poly it would run better. And they never actually addressed the real issues that they had in their games. So all the N64 games are way too low-poly for their own good. Okay, this is the baked pipe, so it doesn't count. I do actually have to unbake this. Like that. I use a Gamecube controller. Yep, this looks fine to me. It looks a little bit like it's made out of plastic, to be honest. Something about it just looks like plastic. The rim is too wide? Really? You think that's why it looks like it's made out of plastic? Yeah, maybe this is better. It's not the right green, this is actually the original RE64 pipe screen. I think if anything the issue is that it has too much white. It's still white at the top. I don't like parallel launcher, that's why I don't use it. It's like the most annoying emulator ever. I think I should edit the texture to... Wait, what the hell? Yeah, let's just make the green more intense here. It should be darker, so the shadow is true. But I actually do need the black color for that. And I don't have it yet, so... We gotta edit the texture for that. I don't like that. It doesn't even work on my computer. There's my first alliance with it, it literally doesn't work. People keep telling me to use it, no, it doesn't work. I can literally not boot up Romex with it. Skill issue, bad PC. Okay, let me open parallel launcher, I'll show you what happens. No thank you, no thank you, no thank you. No thank you for updates. Alright, let's just try to open. Multiple controllers are connected, press any button. I can't control Mario! Everything is blinking. The fuck is going on? I'm not updating it. I tried that before. Your controller mapping is broken. No, stop coping. I'm so sick of this. How many times do I have to do this song and dance? Where I try and use the emulator and it doesn't work. No, you are coping. It really looks like user error. No, it doesn't work. I've had people in the discord with me. The people, literally the person that programmed parallel launcher. In the discord with me. And he couldn't figure out what's wrong. Stop trying to tell me. No. You're coping. Fuck this. I am so done dude. I fucking hate this emulator. Because you guys keep bringing it up. Every time it's brought up, I hate this more. I'm just gonna become the number one parallel launcher hater. Just because you guys keep telling me to use it. That's what happens when you ban people. They start hating it. Even if they have no good reason for it. See, skill issue. That's exactly what you're saying now. And that's the problem. Dude. Parallel launcher tarts can't just let me not use parallel launcher in peace. All I wanna do is emulate fucking Mario 64. How hard can this be? That's the name I just chose for you guys. Parallel launcher tarts. How does it feel? Parallel launcher tarts. Parallel launcher cells. What's parallel launcher for? Parallel launcher was made because there's a plugin called Parallel. Which is mostly accurate to N64. A lot more accurate than Gliden and stuff. But it only worked in Retroarch. And Retroarch is the most dogshit, unusable emulator ever. And no one wants to interface with it. So they made Parallel launcher as a way to interface indirectly with Retroarch. So that you can use the Parallel plugin without touching Retroarch. That is the entire purpose of Parallel launcher. It's a package for Parallel plugin. Well, I mean, that's what it was originally. By now it's like a more proper emulation. Alternative. That has integration with rawmaking.com and stuff. But it's literally useless to me. Why would I ever use it? Okay, that transition is a bit too harsh. I'm gonna make some changes to it. Okay, I think the section is starting to work. Just gonna make some changes to it. Do you use PjxrDebug and Breakpoint as much? Yeah, I use it a bunch. Actually no, I use NEMU64. Which is much better than Project64 Debugger. I get bad drawing with every drawing. I would have to use my old computer otherwise. No, there's nothing wrong with using Parallel launcher. If it works for you, it just doesn't work for me. Why is everyone battering me with that? Just leave me alone, man. I don't know what they are. Never used them. I used emulators to emulate the Nintendo 64. If that wasn't obvious. I just needed to emulate my game. So I have an idea of what it's gonna look like on the N64. Does that sound crazy? That is the only purpose emulators have in my life. And Project64 can do that. So why would I now go out of my way and look at another emulator? Unless it was more accurate or better in any way. There would be no point to it. Now if I had issues with Project64 and I wanted a more accurate but slightly less convenient emulator I would use NEMU64. Because it does that. I would still not use Parallel Launcher. If I wanted accurate I would use my N64 first of all. That's my first option for accuracy. My second option would be NEMU. And then after that maybe Ares or Simple64. Parallel Launcher is very far away. It's like my fifth or sixth option. That's easy. This should... Let me close this one because I keep opening it. If they can't save state... Okay, that's easy. You actually can save state. That's how you're gonna test it. Okay, the pixel is not actually black. Okay. Dude, you have no idea. You guys know that Spongebob episode where Squidward is like Dude, what day is it? Is it Squidward Annoyday? That's how I feel right now. Is it Case Annoyday today? Is that why you're bringing up Paralox? And asking me to use it and claiming it's a skill issue when it doesn't work Even though I wrote to create that and it doesn't work and he couldn't help me figure out help He couldn't help me figure out why it doesn't work Why is it not like they are like I Feel like the pipe is okay, but something's missing it's not giving me the vibe, you know I Think the shine looks like garbage still I Yeah, I can make the safe in there Find a better texture. I can't find one. I made this or pyro made this and I helped make this just now He's a lot of safe You Should just redex off of this and use an end of map Give me make this like a two-cycle material thing How do Mario pipes usually look like The same pipe They don't really look and map to me but the top has quite a shine Take zero shit. Well, if I made a shine, it would be text zero plus prim multiplied by shade alpha But we also have to multiply the shade somehow hey, I Think even the sunshine man, yeah Hmm What if we do something crazy actually I Have a crazy idea that might just work I Think this might look awesome. I Just need to find the right texture for it and this one is not itch You know And here's something it's special Let's see how this looks I Definitely looks very shiny I should probably shape the smooth down to shine And maybe make the shine less intense Oh, yeah, I think I like this No, I don't want to know I'll shine it just a job. Oh Yeah, this is what I like I Okay, now we have the next issue actually the reason we made the pipes in the first place is because we need the pipes here And because we want there to be differently colored pipes So I probably have to make eight textures not a textures I have one two three four pipes We need four pipes there's gonna be a bunch of pipes that lead to each other actually Should we maybe do this without the pipes? Let me just tell you my plan for this area And then you guys that you can tell me what you think. So there's a wild west town here And there's a train run and then there's the next area that you can enter here This next area is gonna be a little more surreal This area is gonna have mostly just canyons but inside the canyons there's gonna be Wild West references Just things that are symbolic for it So I'm thinking We're gonna have a giant shotgun that you can walk on we're gonna have an old wheel that is just stuck in a canyon We're gonna have an old shed. We're gonna have a giant skull and we are gonna have a big hoof iron They're gonna be around here Mario's goal in this area is gonna be to find the treasure. There's a guy that stands here and He's talking about how there's a treasure hidden and he gives you the first hint So the first hint might be something like inside the big skull so you go into the big skull you do a ground point here and then there's a sign and the sign will tell you something like Between the shed and the main building of the Yoshi Ranch, right? So you would go over here ground point here and that would be another sign So the sign sent you all over the area and you're gonna Platform between them. I'm thinking either we may get sort of play actually has to plan from everywhere or We may get so that there's pipes that you can take that go from one area to another area as a shortcut. I Think that might be more fun because it has more discovery to it is you're gonna look around fight the pipes fight the shortcuts We're not giving the player both options. That makes no sense Who I mean putting the pipes is giving the player both options We can't have an option in the menu that lets you turn on or off the hot pipes Is what I'm saying Still need a brighter shade of green honestly, yeah, maybe This is the most saturated shade of green possible That actually no, I can make it slightly more saturated. All right, we'll do that There you go All right, I see literally zero opinions in chat, so I'm just gonna go with the pipe Wait, how do we have 180 viewers? Who are you guys? How are so many people watching me? That's crazy Additive color game I Just eat like a sandwich    So I need to make a separate geo layout But I also need to set the pipe color somehow and I don't want to have to redo this So what's the best way of doing this? Scallops are in it. Yeah true It's probably why everyone's just off after Christmas I Know the easy solution would be to make this a two cycle material and to just reuse the geo layout with that But that would make our pipes to cycle which is kind of not good Am I willing to make what's in the future? Huh Huh, what's that mean? Okay, I think what we have to do is we take the pipe we make it a separate model It's the only way to do this, unfortunately Switch what's Every stream I make automatically becomes a VOD I'm not sure. I understand Like what what are you asking of me here? I Christmas was good. We played smash remix Oh, no, did I export this as a ci8? You see our T for Christmas dude, you got scammed people are trying to get rid of those People would pay you to pick up their CRT actually He was switching your blender scenes to SRGB instead of filmic I'm pretty sure I'm using filmic on purpose Either way, I know there's one right option and one wrong option and I'm using the right option It does make a difference And There's nothing wrong with CRT stand just a bit big and impractical I Don't know if they still have less input like than modern TVs But I know that they used to be a lot better And Okay, so we're gonna add a GeoESM to this And this GeoESM will just set the pipe color We're gonna get it from the bparam2 up a bit I think I Okay, but melee on CRT is complete shit because vanilla melees input like is awful and it's not even consistent That's why I don't like CRT melee Unless they fix that by now, but I remember back when I was playing melee They did not and playing on CRT just sucked Because there was a literal randomness and whether your inputs would work or not I Gonna comment this out for now just so we can make sure it compiles Still got an externet I Mean it's run very well in there something like 15 flaws in a way that we might try to input something Yeah, I actually know about all these flaws. I was a very serious media player a long time ago And I knew of all these mechanics because I'm very technical I I Mean dash back and getting out of tumble were definitely the most egregious one and I guess dash back out of crouch maybe Honestly, I feel like even if a smash game came out today and was as quick as melee people wouldn't jump on it Because modern smash games have way too many fucking characters. How are you gonna play the game? You have to spend so much time on every matchup to actually get decent at it Like literally in melee you need to spend like Hundreds of hours in a matchup before you are really decent at it Before you know the combos well enough And even then you're not done. You can keep going I Miss America's because of its celebrating gaming. I Mean, yeah, maybe it is about that. That is just not a thing that I or melee players would be interested in One I'm just gonna name them like this Thanks, man keeps trying to really spend everything he made too many claims to know about it every far and now it's like the feathers Yeah No, I know I know what hex is doing Like I know it's stuff It is very sunny to try to fix all of that Because that will always be stupid input barrier things and that shouldn't be there Especially since the controller they're using has so many restrictions in my opinion Just fuck the restrictions just like unlimited controllers free mealy Don't serve saves anymore and your friends who's got a gun or whatever characters. That's also true. That's tragic Hello dawn, let's have a yellow pipe I guess You should unlock the speed or not you why I true sure My first romhack is very rushed and very bad I Don't think there's much of an argument here. I literally made it in two weeks while running romhacking You See that I made this correct I did the hell There's been that's been out of crunch She'll not shit rubs aren't that bad. I can't do them consistently on GCC or used to And one point all being consistent is not that important either Tumble is much more important than those and I think that's my god of crutch can be consistent. It's just really difficult and annoying Yes, this is all console compatible I Guess this actually we can have a great one great. It's a cool color I Remember his first romhack and I'm sure they all hated them because they also gonna bet you anything But come on, it's the first eggs. Of course gonna miss things about running Well back when I made my first tech UV mapping your Mars for it wasn't even possible so I don't blame myself for that one But also I didn't try to make a good tank as my first tank I just tried to make a heck just anything Some vanilla controllers can do them a lot that's false every controller can do the straight down method Maybe some of them can't do the notch shield drop. I mean, yeah a lot of them can't but you don't need that You can just do the straight down method So Nope, I don't know psx dev. I only care about my stupid n64 games really Hmm How do I best do this maybe like Can I just put this here Ah, they have a feature to unlock all characters at once oh, that's so cringe Undefined reference to pipe textures. Ha how? Oh, they might not including textures I think Might not be Rain location truncated. Okay There we go That's such a dumb hack I have to do It still has the lights one no way All right, if I did everything right we should be able to have four pipe colors now Undefined With some custom behavior from r6100kubish I am writing one this one if you're not gonna well, but I never think about making levels Making levels is a lot easier than making a hack like you described I Hope the next smash game has a lot less characters I wanted to just be my nintendo guys the ones I know. I don't want to play a bunch of guys that I don't know Ultimate doesn't have the charm for me personally Undefined Why didn't this work What's the crash here, I don't think it's the model But what else would it be Is that a mario remake yes, we're working on it Undefined Yeah, god damn it Do I need to I don't think I need to add those worms But I have to add them later anyway, so might as well do it now Undefined Smash normal is just anime war is a game. Yeah, kind of We're not launching the debugger for this Launching the debugger is a little annoying and debugging codes. It's even more annoying because you have to do it in assembly Undefined So I try to do this as late as possible as a last resort Yeah, I guess this is kind of difficult to call this a ROM hack since it's just like editing the source code so much This is also a problem This is the ROM texture from it Undefined That wouldn't cause a crash but I still want to see what happens now There are no debug symbols The emulator and the compiler are two completely separate instances Undefined They have no connection whatsoever I think there's an experimental thing that would let you debug C code, but I do not have that set up Hello Yoshi party Hello gooey gooey It seems to be crashing ever since I entered these warp pipes, so let's just see what happens when I remove them I don't see anything here that would cause a crash. That's the concerning part Yeah, just adding the warp pipe somehow causes the crash Undefined I also gotta add like a skeleton or something here. I'm just gonna mark the spot as something still needs to be done I'm thinking I will just add like three ribs here Undefined Wait a second. Am I using the B params for the warp wrong? Oh No, actually this looks fine There's plenty of these You can combine the debug symbols in this material, I suppose I'm doing Undefined I have no idea what you're talking about I just know assembly and programming. You're talking about weird tech I have never heard of in my life Does the warp pipe do something with its model ID maybe Sec3 condition should be here No, this should all be fine I might have to pull out NEMU64. I think it would give me a breakpoint or like a PC program counter for where the crash is Because like what the hell this is such a weird point for it to crash I do have to connect my controller to do this and I'm not sure if I can Just to prove PS1 superiority, I think the PS1 has like a 35 megahertz Thing CPU And my optimized source code actually runs on 25 megahertz if you really want So the PS1 should be capable of running it Unless the numbers I just said are wrong So I don't think programming a game entirely in the assembly would improve the performance. I actually think it would make it worse because If you compile a lot if you make a lot of code most of it is gonna be worse because the compiler Does optimize better than a lazy human? so Why is there a skinned part the fuck but also this told me the exact pc of the crash so we can just look at this now d974 geoset pipe color the crash is in my code here and you don't really need debug symbols if you're just really really fucking good at assembling so oh so see who needs debug symbols the simulator isn't publicly released now yet but i like it a lot there we go just as i was doing leela i am so glad that you said armless and not parallel i fucking hate parallel that they won't leave me alone ever they just keep talking about it i am not sold on the colors i think maybe we need different colors we want distinct colors but we want coherent colors i think so the optimization for both consoles should be the same yeah these are colorful pipes there are four pipes in this region and the yellow one leads to the yellow one and the gray one leads to the gray one and so on um oh yoshikana yoshis are more colors than this they could all be shades of red orange gray and orange give a lilac one why lilac  i think the gray one looks good and i think the yellow one looks good bring back red pipes yeah whatever it was just shades between red and yellow so the first one would be like this shade of yellow and then we'd have like this shade of yellow and then we'd have this shade of yellow and then we'd have just of red  minus no this is yeah it's minus 38 and the lowest one we want is this minus 127 minus minus 127 so we have 89 divided by 330 so we have 88 next surely hsv values mean something clueless so okay maybe that's too much actually let's do 63 next actually that's the second one and then we do 88 it's such a little bit maybe it is okay and then we do one two three case do you need to record yes yes yes it's very important that you are able to tell them apart from afar that's the point of them you can change i could but i don't want to i think these are easy to tell apart colorblindness moment i think i think we take those if you're colorblind i'm sorry you can still tell them apart by brightness actually no that's bullshit wait i'm pretty sure a colorblind person can tell these apart do we have a colorblind person in chat right now yeah they are reasonable to tell apart just from brightness so you don't think it's possible the left arm or not yeah i guess this one and this one here is kind of difficult to tell apart well you will see them almost next to each other you're saying that's not how it works you think colorblind people do not perceive brightness the same way that color seeing people do i don't know if that's actually true or false i think it's false so the pipes most interesting well these are this is just the grayscale image okay guys it's not important enough to tell them apart to the point where we need to put symbols on them so these are just going to be shortcuts in the level that you can use like the worst thing that happens when you enter a pipe you didn't mean to is that you have to enter the pipe again it's gonna take like five seconds out of your life colorblindness simulator try it if you want i didn't even read that i just said no oh that's so easy to tell apart the hell oh these are all super monochrome maybe not i mean it's still possible okay these two are kind of difficult although this one arguably okay these two are very difficult and these yeah it's i guess it's just the red one the red and the orange one five seconds is a crazy amount of time for you don't lie it's true five seconds for me is an eternity okay so i agree on the red and the orange one i will shift this slightly further into orange then there you go i think i made it worse i made it worse i know i made it worse back to red the reason i think i made it worse is because we shifted it into a color that is brighter so yeah the pipes really aren't that deep they're just shortcuts you can use together at the level faster you're entirely free not to interact with these or to do whatever else you want so maybe label the pipes no i'm not putting text boxes on everything sometimes you just have to have a sleek design that doesn't over explain itself braille yeah fuck why didn't i think of that i need to add braille to my game  okay i have a color blindness story here by myself and maybe it's not a color blindness story but it is a story And I'm going to use a colorblindness while I tell the story so there was someone in my comments explaining to me that maybe instead of casting the function signature to avoid casting of the return value I should use a union and the union would have an s32 and an s16 value and I should just access the s16 value and in that moment I felt like a colorblind person was explaining color to me just because what this person said was so insane like insanely nonsensical that it could only make sense to a person that is unable to perceive the world of programming in the same way that the colorblind person can perceive some of the colors like this person just lived in an alternate version of reality that's so legal well it doesn't work that's the point it's not about whether that's a legal code or whatever and like a literally just doesn't work and it's just nonsense no I got a wrong casting just what this person explained wouldn't get a wrong casting yeah we have unions that's not the issue dude these pipes look so good now what the fuck that's what you meant huh wait maybe I'm missing something I'm saying I managed to get around casting by like doing some cursed stuff or memcopy instead of cast but it's still gonna cast the demo had HD textures the demo is kind of a mess well GCC optimizes out memcopies if it can predict the result of a memcopy and it will just turn it into a cast so we got a hoof iron so the skull is here the shotguns here we need a wheel a hoof iron and the shed is here so the wheel is gonna be here and the hoof iron is gonna be here and then we have most of the area done and we can do the scavenger hunt casting voice actors or something damn that's funny that is definitely one way to understand what I am saying this is like the most random geometry I can think of really this is just like oh okay you want to run around all right here you go leave me alone that's what this area is I don't remember any partners from pm1 or 2 really I know Goombario and Koopario but other than that I can't think of any right now oh there's also the fat lady that can blow I think there's a cheap cheap there's also Yoshi actually okay I remember a few but I don't have a favorite dude I hate when programming languages are making things more tedious to do just because they want to be safe like dude just let me do my things like come on just leave me alone why do I have to type like reinterpret cast when I literally just wanna fucking cast the hell what kind of fucked up language makes its grandma longer all the time grandma not grandma that's just not how natural languages work almost every language on the planet right now is getting simpler and simpler to speak except for fucking C and programming languages because people are fucking it up we get money from it I want to pay for that game I know I unfortunately cannot monetize this I have to release it for free or I will get murdered the restrictions help to combine optimized code I feel like you don't need the restrictions for that I feel like if you just program well you can do that even without all the restrictions okay I want more bones here because I think the bones will look really cool what was the Christmas gift the chocolate is the best so I do want a giant wheel from like an old Western carriage I'm thinking maybe we can turn this into a platforming object somehow maybe I can make it spin somehow the question is what do we attach it to I will never understand how people like eating mint like what do you do after you're done brushing your teeth swallow you know what do we know an axle stuck in the ground hmm actually yeah if we have a big enough axle that would actually just work the problem is the player would be able to jump on the floor that the axle is standing on unless we made this a really tiny thing chewing mint gum right now okay but do you swallow your toothpaste after you're done it's refreshing answer the question Lila do you eat your toothpaste you do damn okay valid keep eating mint then you just said I do yum you just admitted to it you can't back out now what a waste dude can you believe it this loser doesn't need his toothpaste what a wimp okay let me just ensure that this is actually fun let me just see that this works fine why are you like this I'm sorry I am right all the time that bar just scared me I thought I was in my game I was like where does the bars in the game come from I think walking down the shotgun is gonna be a cool set piece this area needs some rocks maybe some enemies the axle works honestly if I have one axle we should probably have two all right lastly we only need the roof iron and then I don't like how inaccessible the next area here is let's make it a lot easier to reach and then there's a hoop iron in the middle let's answer in the three or four sided polygons three sided ones obviously no it's not gonna lead anywhere I was thinking of making it like a bullet bill cannon but there isn't really a place for it to shoot at yeah I have a normal job at a game dev and it's gears for breakfast so the hoof iron could actually be big and like go from here to here oh that would look cool let's do that really I think the idea behind this area really should be like the reason this area would be fun it's just your sick movement there's gonna be some cool ideas thrown in to look at and that's it literally that's all I think that's all we need for this to be fun I just need to approximate the hoof iron shape here this is not actually gonna be what the roof iron looks like I just want the shape so we can know that the platforming works all right let's disperse the warp pipes we have one go from up here to the Yoshi area then we have one go from this part here so it goes that way to the wheel area and then the last one is planned from the end of the area to where the X is okay it is a dumb question but since you take parts of other game engines could you take objects clothes from other games and doesn't Mars 64 you'd have to change a lot of things on how objects interface with the game engine for that but of course it's possible to remake them kind of but it's never gonna be one-to-one I hope it went 4% is asking for a lot but actually every dx3 came out recently and it looks to be almost 10% even which would be crazy so these are gonna be turning wheels they will not be like this okay let's say we wanted to go to the Yoshi ranch the fastest way to get there what would that be I guess that wasn't very fast oh wait I can just go no no where can I go there's one mob there there's these I'm gonna rotate when you walk and I'm like unrealistic man I think this would be very fitting for a lot of objects oh what the fuck why did that well to Bob a battlefield 0x2 to cut them in bro is still talking about eating toothpaste dude there's 200 people watching if what I just said makes at least 2% of you guys curious about how toothpaste actually tastes when you eat it four people are going to eat toothpaste today keep that in mind we might have four people eating toothpaste today we call this this is called stochastic terrorism where you say something to a large group of people and then at least a few people of those are going to do the thing make it five that's how fortune works maybe kinda I think the mobs work you tried eating toothpaste as a kid and it was ass okay maybe I just dropped from five back down to four this man is not believing that he's having none of it like he's like yeah dude if you think toothpaste tastes bad maybe you just ate the wrong toothpaste you know maybe you should have eaten good one not the bad ones toothpaste doesn't taste well I guess we all have to find out for ourselves next stream you guys come back and tell me our toothpaste tasted all right I think I am done for today we got the area roughly mapped out next we need to put the special set pieces in and then we can do the scavenger mission and then we'd already have the first star of the level done that'd be insane we actually have so much progress already either way I'll see you next time bye bye
