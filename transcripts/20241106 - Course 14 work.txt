You you Hello Sony Hello X links Welcome to the stream I I Didn't vote I would never vote but also I can't vote And on the official ham You Do we have any OST pics for the day? You All right 3d, well, you know what that sounds decent You Hellooo  Hello Hello    Hello I think I never heard that one, I think Cad Morny True I scripted a banger video with the Mario 64 GBA guy We're gonna make a video about that We have a bunch of really cool stuff to talk about Let's go Hello, Velza I love this guy, look at him, dude He's such a derpy I like him a lot Who's Vega So I'm mostly finished UV mapping this area here And I have some decent platforming everywhere I'm pretty happy with how this looks I mean, obviously this isn't gonna be the final look But this is what we're gonna send off to Biobak And he was gonna make the colors pretty and everything Yeah, they're googly eyes I also made this whole area a little bit bigger You can no longer do the triple jump thing here Looks kinda grey, true I'm hoping you can fix that Yeah, I'm a bit sad about the ground pound jump skip too But I think it's fine The area needed to be bigger for the sake of the camera That's one issue I hate in Mario 64 when that happens No one got a Twitch notification? That would suck Which one am I the most proud of? I think that's not really the terms in which I think about these things It's supposed to be a pencil shaving So that's perfect Well, the area's not fully playable yet Because we need instant warps And to make instant warps we need a collision map And to make a collision map we need the first full level Unless we wanna waste a lot of time So I'm not gonna make the area fully playable until the rework is done But I am going to fix a few bugs that we run into here One of them being the fact that this guy's being a little shit They also snap back when they move in the end Which I really hate But I don't know why They shouldn't be Hello, Selton Have you guys ever seen the Mario 64 Game Boy Advance thing? Let me just... He sent me the ROM actually Looks like this He has like a newer version too, whether it's an actual 3D Mario But this running on the Game Boy Advance is so cool He also has text just now and everything I'm more proficient in software than hardware in the N64 at the moment Oh, it's because of the eye gravity thing here Well, we don't need that There we go Perfect And I like the way he pushes you off this Shoe It's perfect I Like him. What do you guys think of the bump? He'll will of course be a little more visible once the colors are in The eyes are very funny you get a place a few more of these guys around this area Probably want to make them playable to cut bump. I think that's a good name. Yeah I Think up the rats like I just did no problem at all Being close 15 this area is a little more difficult. I press C there. It's I Wait, how did I do that? That shouldn't be possible. Should it? Hello? Can I conquer Honka? I There's one other place I'm looking for with bumps But the maze like structure of this makes us pretty difficult I think this area would be a lot more navigable if the directions had a lot more difference in how they look Hello, boo-boo We Also gotta add spikes to this area here I want this to be like spikes that you jump over Now, this is the other bump area Cart bumps Super game by color goes pretty hard. What's that? Ah Little crayon spikes. Yeah, that could look nice or pencil rather Don't under oh shit But rama is about to make such use of your optimizer. So let's extend the real console doesn't require the expansion pack anymore Romics never needed the expansion pack The reason romex used the expansion pack is convenience For the older tools, it was just easier to be like, all right instead of properly managing my memory I'm just gonna use the expansion pack and that's what all the old text is. That's why they require the expansion pack So you don't even need my optimized source codes to make romex run without the expansion pack I I See biomech You just made me involuntarily learn French I Will not forgive you So I got an email today and that said that I'd play roblox for two hours they will pay me $135 So expected to our roblox stream sometime this week Chris like four hundred thirty-five dollars. I'm gonna play roblox. That's like almost $70 an hour to play roblox So So when I say they required when I start apparently Yeah, it requires it because it was the tools to make it work. We're just kind of programmed lazily basically You could absolutely make star road work on the n64 without an expansion pack It's Pretty impressive dude, that's so crazy. You mentioned that Yes, you know what? There's this brief. I have no idea what dress to impress us, but let me let me show this to you Wait you brief Bonuses play murder mystery to or dress to impress with your community Look if you play dress to impress with me, I don't know what that is But if you play that with me I get money for that So, yes, I will absolutely play dress to impress with you I don't know what that is though They also say I can spend I think $10 on here and they will give me the money back I Kind of sucks. Oh spend ten to six dollars in game. I get reimbursed plus an additional $30 It's a fashion game But yes, I will absolutely be playing roblox with you guys most likely on Sunday No, you don't have to pay them the 135 is the base rates I will be paid that no matter what Hey, so play it That's the guy that's fat where it's like there's a bunch of videos where people say ha ha ha he's fat I Really have to have multiplayer co-op work on my console multiplayer co-op. Oh Does multiplayer co-op require the expansion pack? Are you sure stratosphere? I'm not sure if I made that require the expansion pack or not because it can definitely work without the expansion pack I Either way I need to find the place where I just put the bumps. It's below the pillars Yeah, I don't see you why the model is from the player mod shotgun Mario 64 should also not require The memory pack That should all work without it I don't know what you're doing But it's dysfunctional, okay I Don't know what you're doing. I don't know what you're doing. I don't know what you're doing To the right side of the pillars So here Dude I had the weirdest sales pitch today or yesterday There was someone that wanted to sell us internet. They had it for like $25 cheaper than what we have right now And obviously I say well, that's a good deal I would take it and then he didn't have a contract or anything for me to sign So like I didn't agree to it yet It's cuz like there was no contact or anything, right? So I have no idea what I'm getting And then Today 12 hours later a guy came by and placed this new router and this guy basically told us Yeah, our internet is dogshit. I Don't use it. I just work for this company. I don't actually use their services right and And now I don't know what to do now we have the router that by their own admittance is dogshit and It is what it is Hello so much. Oh true today is the election Guys, does anyone know if there's like a life tracker of the election? The eyes look at you the eyes to look at you I said like a life checker of the election where we can like look at a fun Show me biggest panda start after polls close. Oh Buddy left in Germany. No, I moved to Canada in 2021 I Guess one if you're using some my optimization for improving the audio quality in case No, we can't really improve the audio quality because we are already using the maximum that the n6 was capable of quality wise We do use some stream music which sounds a lot higher quality But it eats up a lot of room space and there's a much we can do about that Life tracker election, but I want like I Want like the talking people at CNN going like oh my god, the election is so close. This is so exciting Remember, you know, that's what I want. I don't want to just have like a number go up. I want the full like WWE Excitements bullshit experience No, I can't team I just can do two hours If I could exploit it I would do not worry By the way, bye, thank you saw that that deal in our VMs with the topaz AI I'm pretty sure they just want to send me a virus Don't click on anything. They sent I'm just wasting their time I Do German though, yeah, I am from Germany And I moved to Canada because I needed to flee Germany Germany fucking sucks Who's Steve Austin, oh wait, that's a wrestling guy No, when I was watching wrestling, I liked Eddie Guerrero. He was the heel. I thought he was cool I Never looked at my DMS. Oh, there's nothing private going on there All right, so I think the inside of the permit is fine now next we need the 8-bit section So for the 8-bit section, we will need a small bit of brainstorming Latino I didn't even know he was Latino when I was watching WWE. It was just a guy I was like six or seven. I stopped wrestling. I stopped watching wrestling when I found out it's fake Like that's how young I was when I was watching wrestling I Okay, so we have a pipe here And you can reach it with the wing cap or you can do some weird stuff like this And I think this might be a bit too weird Like I don't want to make players do that Right, I know it's Chris 14 and we can have a bit of difficulty but that's too much difficulty But also, I don't know if I like it being in this spot at all I feel like there's better spots for it Oh That's a weird line of coins flying over there That's nasty I Can always keep a little fridge He really really wants the rollable bridge at this point. I'm almost willing to add it just for him All right, where would we want this voluble bridge But wait, you just kick the bridge and you're at the pipe isn't that a little bit boring And how do you figure out to kick it? You Hello Zena Zena have you made sure to shave your balls Now that you've watched the twitch chat I heard they stop as soon as you shave your balls I Make a bridge original you don't steal You have no internet in your PC the guy fucked it up. Oh my god Well after the stream we're just gonna set the internet back no problem I Trying to find the perfect location for this of course what you could also have as a rollable bridge and then We remove the coin that's on here And I guess the easiest place to put a rollable bridge would be over here That would be a nice place for a Yoshi coin. Oh But you could also just fly over there Anything we do with a roll of rubric is weird because you unlock it the wing cap anyway You And look how nice the box looks now Isn't that sweet Ever seen such a nice-looking block Oh We also have this whole place here, there's not really much going on here This is all just a path to one of the coins And what maybe makes sense to make this feel more like something that is mid-level I also still need to turn this bridge into a real thing Still waiting for the cardboard Donkey Kong and cardboard peach from Yuki I Doesn't work scarf cats. No, it's it's fine that people skip it. That won't even be the issue I just noticed a buck Bucks The egg points when it should move the points Because we move the coins into the top corner here Look, if Mario takes damage, you see how the egg coins move to the left. Oh You don't You see how they move to the right of a heel That's supposed to be the coin counter doing that I have no idea about German politics and I don't care about them German politics is all corruption, but there's no point in actually doing anything voting vice The only thing your vote changes is like what the politicians saying to like get your vote They're still just stuck in it to steal tax money Yeah, but it's a lot worse in Germany I think compared to like the US At least in US it's like they take bribes from big corporations in Germany, I think you'll see just take all the tax money I mean our current setup is fine. Maybe we don't need to change it Maybe it's fine that you need the wing cap to get there basically But people are definitely gonna try to go there without the wing cap people are definitely gonna just Yahoo Which you know that then reaches but it's too difficult to move I Still thinking about this We could make a mid map for the side of the cardboard here, I think that maybe makes sense I Say something more we can do maybe with exclamation boxes. I think very much underutilized exclamation boxes in this game I Love Sonic the Hedgehog Not much is going on tonight, I think So If we use exclamation boxes like you can break them to get somewhere We could use breakable boxes Like, you know the Mario Bros breakable boxes, I feel like they would be kind of cool to use We use that effect with falling leaves blah blah that's actually the original effect we added the snow later You can lemon guy but that's way too awkward to do platforming wise I Could of course also just place the retro pipe on one of these Or Actually, I might just like might like this better What if we move to Yoshikane from there on to here and then you just collect that with the wing cap? And we move the 8-bit pipe on to here. I Don't know why x-links fired you I Didn't know you worked for him I Think the bit pipe would be perfect on here This is an easily visible location. That's kind of hard to get to I Will try that and remove this whole spot here Oh Trees have been random it is what You Yes, the retro section for this is going to be Mario painted spot Switch to a new workout routine Yeah, it's difficult to pick games to suggest But we are going to have this be Mario paint themed and then the last retro section is gonna be Mario 64 themed Yeah, awesomely stratosphere I have no idea I Don't know why smash remixed me eight megabytes in the first place I It's the saw from workouts pain pain But that's still not a good pain And of course also be here but that's way too late into the game Mmm Could we do something here Cut the retro pipe be hidden in the pyramid here Maybe like on the back of the pyramids or in the middle of the pyramids Possibly something No, you need chest to cream teamer I Could have like a little hole on the sides with the pipe. Let me just Get a feeling for what the vibe is like You Traps and arms does not include shoulder. For example, you could do biceps curls and Shrugs and there would be no shoulder in there I'm not doing gold and I I Think golden is a terrible concept Okay, look hear me out when you make Game you need to be aware of the restrictions you have and aiming with a stick fucking sucks so that's a restriction you need to keep in mind when you make goldeneye actually goldeneye was so messed up they had to use two controller modes to like play the game it's crazy isn't it okay so putting it in the back here no one's gonna find it too difficult to find I could put it in the tent unless we added like a spring here that puts you on top of the pyramid or maybe we put like an exclamation box on the top of the pyramid and then from there you will see the pyramid pipe I think that actually is viable I kind of like exclamation boxes we should be using exclamation boxes more across the whole game exclamation box is not awesome banyo kaiyui sorry I have a brain defect that makes me say that I grew up on pal ocarina of time 2 in 16fps it was a prime there has to be some kind of cruelty law against making children play ocarina of time in 16fps imagine you only get one chance to experience ocarina of time for the first time in your life and it's in 16fps finger bork what is that can tell me what the other members of the game bomb gear are sure and so we turn to scale value of your beeper I'm free is a flag one means turn the other way to means turn on the pitch axis instead of your axis and oh wait that's it it only has no it also has a two more people at one beeper and four is the scale value and a param one and two rotation speeds right there you go we have one on two is rotation speed beeper and three controls how it rotates so if it's one and rotates the other way around if it's two and rotates on the pitch axis and beeper and four is for the scale does that make sense let's say this is the one it spins like this you you you you you you set beeper one to one it goes the other way you set it to two and it rotates this way doesn't really mean anything wait what what did I miss finger bork oh I see yes one and two are speed one in two um basically the first one controls most of the speed and the second one is like very very granular fine control I don't remember why I needed it but I did it that way I don't even remember if we really need it but it's not like there's a disadvantage to using both so unless you want to add a new parameter then I can of course remove beeper and two I can definitely fit a param for prim alpha we could easily do something like um something like beep param three and zero x seven no f c and alpha there you go brightness per height yep let me just um opacity equals beep param three and zero xrc there you go it's implemented all right I think this looks kind of neat yep I I like the pipe here do you know what we still haven't thought about the lava in this area I feel like this is one area I will have to keep making easier and easier interesting I didn't expect many changes either but that's good that's great you have ideas all right perfect dude this section is so cool I kind of love this section like gameplay-wise this is probably one of my favorite parts of the game and now it's all gone coins are messed enemies nope that's not more sunshine inspired oh you're answering something yeah but you were just randomly typing that in chat can the sauce deal damage um I think I actually forgot to make them deal damage I think I just want them to be solid though because we don't need it to be any more difficult but it already is um so next area and this is actually the last area for course 14 can you imagine we're almost done with course 14 and course 15 is also already halfway done then it's all courses done and then we just need three more side levels and three overall parts I feel like we're definitely gonna finish all the main content in 2025 and then we have a lot of time to polish the game so we have a retro section mario paint it's mario paint based oh well of course this one is 50% of steam no don't say that no I don't want to shop um wait like f koopa karnal cool echo or koopa karnal gotten reworks yet no um what's gotten reworked is course one course three course four course five um I think there's more course 11 for sure right so it's like one two come on we've go for course two that doesn't take out one two three four five six seven seven wait we never give we never gave names to these never settled on a name for the ice castle I just realized shit let's make it on up real quick cool wave course reworked already oh right right right yeah that's halfway done true you mean the wrong course 15 um no this is this is fine right now it actually is course 15 right now can we see the ice girl sure ice castle's not done either though there's still the outside area that zena wanted to work on that's what it looks like right now nice ice castle perfect name icey fort price below zero barricades you know what I kind of like using the word nold in here because nold sounds mysterious and it also can mean like zero because like it's like below zero  mold no yes n-u-l-l so right this is the one where we need a minty level but that's fucking difficult minty mysteries this castle kind of feels like a labyrinth I feel like that can be used here somehow frozen fortress that's the most boring name ever no front oh polar peak mysterious minty manor this room can look so cool in the end we will definitely have a mirror on the floor here interesting cool this is our question I don't see some requests if there's a song request you guys have to like verbally tell me or something what song did you request I see this somehow I will check this out um what for you maybe I don't want to watch tutorial um I don't see it Minnesota or some cold U.S. states they're definitely not referencing U.S. states below zero bastion no that that's not an alliteration castles and  chateau I like palace piercing palace fortification froze fortress bitter bitter bastion bitter doesn't sound very minty but piercing palace polar palace kind of like poland palace saying large enough I can use in the name um basically it's you're at the peak on a mountain and on this mountain there is a village full of penguins and they're all scared of the big bad monster inside the castle that took over the castle and that's basically the backstory here forgotten frosty fortress forgotten fortress is kind of nice I like forgotten that's a nice word it it fits the psychological like weirdness of this what's a synonym for forgotten surely there's a nicer word for this wait maybe there's like a word that's similar to forgotten that we can use and then put it together amnestic fortress or something surely exists bygone bastion tomorrow movie is based on this level we're on frozen forest the frozen just doesn't flow well I think  Richard is kind of nice wait none of these are synonyms for forgotten very erased erased sorry no lost I like Forgotten Fortress more than Forgotten Frosty Fortress. Forgotten already feels cold to me, you know what I mean? Forgotten as a word is like dark blue, transparent, you know, especially when you put fortress behind it. Some of you guys lost this one, alright, we'll listen to it. Forgotten is a dark grey blue definitely. See you say grey blue and I say transparent blue, I think we're almost like on the exact same vibe here. Some ways of your mind, what? Oh, the AP, yeah, someone requested this. Forgotten Frostlands, I don't know. Oh, I see, Miramic. Abandoned, I don't think that works. I feel like this is not all the words for Forgotten though. There has to be more... Abandoned arctic, I don't know if abandoned is the word. Abandoned arctic, I don't know if abandoned is the word. Passed away castle, it's from Forgotten, it doesn't, I mean, it's kind of nice but I don't know if I like fortress along with it. Desolate is a nice word. Forsaken, Gill etc. Yeah, it's not really abandoned. Alright, we're just going with Forgotten Fortress for now. I think that works. Also, I just realized I forgot to put the pencils. Let's put the pencils. I bet when I make the game as public, people are going to look at this and be like, wow, I'm so glad this is not in the final game. He forgot to put textures on it. But it sucked to have a whole thing without textures in the entire game. We went with Forgotten Fortress. That's what you missed during the whole achieving it. So why did people try to find this? Just because they couldn't? Or is this somehow special and I'm not understanding it? Because I'm a cretin. Yeah, this seems like a very standard song to me. So much anime, sometimes. Is this close enough to a pencil shape? I think it works. So there was this insane mystery song that everyone thought was amazing and they found it after moving us that it was the background track to a mid-porn movie. I think I've heard of that. I don't know. I don't know. A month or two ago, it was that short ago. I thought this was almost a year ago at this point. I can't imagine if there was an easy way to do this. Why does this have to suck so much? I don't know. I have no concept of time. Fair enough. Wouldn't the spikes be too many polygons? Nope. If they were, I wouldn't be doing this. That's all you know. Pencil art? In the beginning of the bomb camp level, is there a risk that they desync because of delay in their spawns to do this in Mario? No, they spawn instantly. Just their drawing distance might pop them in at different times. So they're always perfectly in sync. Yeah, I mean, that's something that would have been a serious issue if it hadn't been like that. This looks like it has a nice texture. What the fuck? I don't know. I don't know. This one has a nice texture. What the fuck? What the fuck? Website as model resource. What? You know pencil numbers? The hell? Why does he know pencil numbers? I don't. What? Definitely looks like spikes. What? Wasn't there also like a Spongebob Lost Media thing? Or was that just a Spongebob episode where they pretended that a Spongebob episode was a Lost Media thing? I feel like I remember the pirate guy just saying that there's Lost Spongebob Media. Oh, I didn't think any of the songs are worse than the others. I think they're all kind of just boring. I kind of saw there was a different spot with spikes, but I guess not. I think that is all the spikes. Unless I am stupid. Nice. What? It's crazy how obsessed humanity collectively is over never losing any information. It's like we just love to have all the information. So on a Mario Paint Retro level, how do we do this? That's the question. Because this isn't really a level. So my original idea was to do like a 3D version of this music and you see the Mario jumping at the top. You would be controlling him basically. Humanity has had this mentality for a long time. Different areas? Areas are different scenes. Anything about 2000 BC? We know a lot. But I imagine that's probably not true. Probably related to the script or just not having been invented before then. So I think the music scene is the most likely candidate for Mario Paint to work in. What else is there in Mario Paint? Is it just painting and music? Yeah. A 3D level that's like an empty canvas. And then as you move around, a cursor appears and places platforms that you have to climb on. Works too. But I think that's not really interesting platforming wise. Like it would look cool, but I don't think it's interesting. There's a flyswatter game. Coloring? Alright, we're done here. Shit, how do we make anything interesting out of this? Yeah, there's many things we can do, but most of these are kind of like... It's just a lot of stuff. It's nothing very fun. Hmm. Maybe we should just look at pictures of Mario Paint. Could find something. Maybe there's something like on the Wikipedia? Or Mariowiki? Relate to form syntax? Relate to preserve art and information? Relate to invent Red Bull? Syntax, really? I don't think that's unique to humans. I think there's many things that aren't really unique to humans, that just appear unique, that are kind of like the product of our human culture, because we're able to live long enough to gather a lot of knowledge, and we're also social enough to carry this knowledge forward. Although then again, I guess elephants are too, or dolphins, I don't know man, it's weird. Art mode, sound mode, music mode, animation mode, net tech. Did you see that IGN hated the new Mario and Luigi game? I wonder if it's really bad, or if IGN is just rage painting. Yeah, I think our only options here is to sound mode, adapt sticker mode, or music mode. And I think music mode is the most likely. IGN gave it a 9? I thought they gave it like a 5, and people got upset. That's the funniest, people got upset over IGN giving it a bad review without having played it before. They're just upset because it's a series they like. That's crazy, right? Or did they play it yet? I don't actually know. Okay but imagine we have this layout here, with these colors, and then we have like dotted lines for the instruments, and you have to jump between notes, and whenever you land on a note, it makes a sound. Oh, SP means Spanish. Not especially. Maybe Mario Paint just sucks as a retro section. Ever thought about that? These aren't even 3D worlds. Maybe we say fuck Mario Paint, it doesn't work, and do something else. What other retro game is there? JGBT. Give me a list of the top 15 most sold Mario games before Mario 64 released. Super Mario Bros, we have that, Super Mario Land, we have that, Super Mario Bros 3, we have that, Super Mario World, we have that, Super Mario Bros 2, we have that, Dr. Mario, Super Mario Land 2, we have that, Mario Kart, we have that, Mario Bros, we have that, Donkey Kong, we have that, Mario's Timetrain, we do not, Yoshi's Cookie, Yoshi, Mario's Woods, and Mario's Missing. Hmm. We don't have Dr. Mario. Mario's Missing though? What is that? Oh god. No, we're not doing this. Hotel Mario, it's possible, that's the crazy part. But I don't think Nintendo would want to reference Hotel Mario. Dr. Mario has the best chance of working, I agree. It'd be like a treasure section. You'd be in a place, maybe it's like an 8x8 grid, and blocks fall from the sky, and you have to jump on the blocks as they fall. Waluigi's taco stand, you mean? We're not doing that. I'm sure it's kind of insane in a sense, but I also make a mess, because you can shoot what early on, because a lot of the most well-remembered are also the best. Eh. I don't know, we use Mario Land in Quest 13. We use Mario Kart 64 in Quest 12. Harder than most media. Ugh. No, that doesn't exist. This one? Waluigi's toenail clipping party. Paper Mario. Not Paper Mario 64. Toenail clipping idea? Yeah, it's a good fallback idea. I'm about to act up. I mean, this is the most obvious one, but it's also kind of boring. Is this Paper Mario 64 or is this CTYD? Paper Mario 64 came out after Mario 64? Well, Mario Kart 64 did too, technically. I don't think many people would understand that reference. Whereas if we did Paper Mario, this would be pretty understandable. Chugga-Kun, right? Who is that? Does he have a foot fetish and it's public or something? I mean, a level like this would look decent, right? And if we use the Yoshi Village, it fits the theme of Return to Yoshi's Island really well. I never used Mario Kart 64. Oh, you're right. There's a gas leak in my house. Royal Antil, have you done that already? Yes. Is this like a Galaxy 2 and a Galaxy 1 retro section? Kind of. But is it really so bad if it's like course 14? You know what I mean? It's like the history of Mario games at that point and not really retro sections. So, Mari, what's that? Mario Woods? That's a game that GPD spat out here. Mario's Woods. What does that look like? Oh, God. That does not look good. Senior Scarf? Mario 10 is from the Virtual Boy, if you're real. I see what you mean. But is Paper Mario 64 really actually Paper Mario from 2000? I am... I'm putting this into Google. It's not real. Wait, what? What the fuck? What the fuck? Imagine dropping a knitting tutorial on the NES. That's fucking crazy. So Mario is a bootleg Smurfs video game with Mario combined as the main character. The problem is a lot of these aren't platformers. What if I tell GPD it excludes all non-platformers? Okay. Mario Bros, Mario Land, Bros 3, World Bros 2, Land 2, Bros Dollars Level, Bros Special. And then Mario Bros. There were not 15 unique platforming titles at the time. What is Super Mario Bros. Special? Okay, but there's no way there were only 9 platformers, right? Bros, Bros 2, Bros 3, okay. Land, Land 2. Worlds. Am I stupid? What? Maybe there were only 9. BuzzFeed's request? Shit, what is this? Mario game or not? Can you pick the really good ones or the fake ones? Play quiz. Yes, yes, yes. What? How do you click no? Yoshi's Cookie. Mario Pinball Land, wait. This is a good thing. This is very good. Mario's Missing, Super Mario Bros. This is real, this is real, this is real, this is real. This is real. This is real, real. Nope, I didn't mean to click that. Oops. Yep, yep. Yep, yep. Yep. Yep, yep. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. Sure, sure. Hungry Hungry Mario. Super Picross, yes, there we go. Mario's Game Gallery, surely. Mario's Picross, yep. 88%. What did I miss? I missed a game called Zerst Yoshi. I missed Super Mario Sunshine. Wait. Oh, I was out of time, I see. I got 88%, I don't think that's too bad. Mario Pinball Land, this could be interesting. From when is this? 2004, nevermind. Doesn't work. Hmm. But I got Mario Sunshine too. VarioLand, Donkey Kong. Mario Bros, Donkey Kong Jr. I don't want two Donkey Kong games in here. Wrecking Crew. Oh god, I don't want Wrecking Crew. Do we bite the bullet and go with Paper Mario? I'm not doing Metroid. I hate Metroid. I mean, this level is pretty, right? I have done Donkey Kong, yes. I think the lame stages are mostly concentrated in the middle. There's also a factor if a paper level just fits so well. You know what I mean? I guess they're just naming random games. They're not even in the Mario universe. F-Zero, Chrono Trigger, Bam Majera. Fortnite. This is such a difficult decision. I feel like there's just a game somewhere that I'm thinking of. Mario like this. Yeah, I had that idea too. I was thinking we put this on an 8x8 and do this. That might be our best option. And Dr. Mario is relatively famous, right? One, two, three, four. Oh, it is an 8x8. Yeah, we do this and then just have the pills fall from the top. How do we make it look like this? Dino, Dino Domains, Freighter Pipe. I forgot what it was. Oh, yes, Mario RPG.  What's the problem with Mario Paint? There's just nothing in there that I feel like I can base the platforming on. The closest we have is like the music. But even the music section just wouldn't look quite good. Unless I like hard-coded the camera position, which I really want to avoid. I want this to still be a 3D platform. It's Jurassic Jungle. Oh, yeah. The canvas and you make them draw Mario like in the song. With a rating based on accuracy. But that's just a random minigame, is it not? I don't know. I mean, this is a random minigame, but do we want that on our AI? How do you make this not feel completely stupid I turn on some more engulf. I don't see the platforming potential there I don't think people would want to color in an image with crayons like in Mario 64 like that's funny for one star but like doing it this much I think dr. Mario might be our best bet here or paper Mario and I'm actually thinking it's dr. Mario I'm building minigame and obviously it was funny all right how do we make this good then you it could have like a switch you stand on and then while you're on the switch you control a pen that just draws onto the canvas that works and then you just draw the Mario you which game are you talking about Sonic the course 15 register is gonna be Mario 64 now we can definitely just like make make there's no problem making the player able to draw to a canvas but make it so I give a pen and while you're holding down a you're scribbling and then you can just trace Mario or something if we did that we would need to probably put an outline of Mario's face and then you have to go around the outline okay you're thinking Mario's face so maybe that would be paint puddles and you step in the paint and it's gonna draw in or something like that and then while you work with your feet painted you'd like draw this line of paint or something and you have to walk across Mario's face to draw him and then maybe with a ground pound you can color in the whole thing said what you're thinking GBM or appears after Mario 64 I think that would work then we let the player draw Mario with the wrong colors I think we should okay well let's make a few notes here so what walk into canvas and get the color there is red, black, white, blue what colors do we need for the Mario face blue beige so these are the ones we need and then let's also just randomly add like green, yellow, purple so that's all the colors you can do it part by part like the flip note part by part do you mean like you first have the mission draw the big mushroom and then you draw that you know and that's something the galaxy cap and Dorian's mystery of the caps with demo you create new platforms by jumping or walking you know like strong dimensions out of those star platforms no no no no I think that's too much okay so how do we handle this we first draw an outline and then maybe like a text prompt appears like finish the outline or something and then after they've done that moves on they have to detect whether the outline is done somehow  it's not like the outline of a mushroom yeah or we could have like the way the player tells the game next step and it just moves on and then we only read the final Mario or you could just tell the player all right like we give the player we give the player a full outline of this it's a dotted lines and then we just tell the player bro Mario I think I prefer that if it's just an outline of Mario and it says draw Mario and then you draw Mario without really referencing the way the song does it that would be easier for me to program as well we can just tell the player you know get get those colors ground point to fill we also need brown kept to the fun and put in my grass we don't have that much space in the safe game but yes this is possible so outline of Mario and the grounds sign on it says Mario um when Mario walks he leaves this space to let us on that floor once we've drawn Mario is close enough you'll get a new star um sign in front of the canvas with the color it will a or a jump jump into a color ground pound to fill the big spots progado         So... Restore it perfectly from memory Compare pixel RGB values between both scenarios If they match Or rather The further away from matching they are The higher your score Once points go below thresholds, you get a star Somebody said something fun, I agree And I think this will work One issue I am going to have with this is Programming the filling is going to be difficult That's going to be something But it should be possible No, I think we're fine with Mario Paint Sonic How does the Mario Paint canvas look like? Let's try it out This guy isn't even painting This guy isn't even painting This guy isn't even painting When do you get to the painting part? Is there going to be a paint in this game? Where's the color picker? Oh, I guess the colors are picked like this That's kinda nice Don't fill that, no fill is kinda... Or well, instead of fill what we could... Okay, well I can't possibly program the fill any worse than what MarioPaint just did Hello Maui So how do you pick a color? You just go up there and pick a color? Alright, that's good I mean it should look like this, scroll Yeah, I think with that it will work The area will be a white void There will be white all around you Then there will be a small grey latch With the colors on it and the sign in front And then there will be a Mario drawn on the floor with the sign in front again And then you can just draw on the floor So do you have a Mario detection algorithm? Yes, I will make one Which won't be too difficult The way it will work is All of Mario's face will have like pixel matching The question is how big do we have to make this? One face or both? Alright I want dotted lines And I need this to be symmetrical Well, actually Okay, this one is awesome I like this one a lot But we need this one painted in And we need this one dotted out lines I have to figure out a way to make this dotted line so we have the base picture The smaller I can make this, the happier I am A bunch of 32x32 RGBA32 would make this easiest to work with So if we could make this a 6x6 grid Which would be 186 pixels That would be great I think this is detailed enough to work Time to penis for this minigame Just a few seconds Yeah, I think 186x186 works But that's 36x36, holy shit Can I make this smaller? 124x124? That is also fine Yeah 124x124 canvas RGBA32 Can I use my restoration based on Nintendo 64 era artwork? Yep, that's likely what I'll do What am I missing? Nothing, I think we're good We just need a good artwork now that we can turn into dotted lines I think this face would be perfect I'm going to smudge some of the paintbrush Nah Do you want to do the Mario Odyssey? Where it fades away everything but the outline when you start drawing Oh, so you show the finished picture But then once you start drawing it goes back to the outline? No, I think I want the outline right away I don't think we want the player to see what we had envisioned it to look like I don't know Not that that is actually what I'm looking at right now None of these face darkly at the camera though That's how you look like in early art Oh, this face would be great If we could get this with a closed mouth Hmm Actually, one issue here is the colors are too complicated But if we had this with simpler colors Let's see This with red colors From the canvas to Mario's facial lines There we go Hmm Okay, I think our plot is solid We just need to make Mario's face now And I'm not doing that right now
