Hello? Oh shit, I need to update the title. Oh my god, they've changed this whole website. Hello puppy Prinny. Not what we're supposed to be working on today. We are on... Panin's video just ended? What? Panin uploaded a video and no one told me? Hello Azif, hello Selton. Hello GameDavid. Any OSD wishes for the day? There's an HD version of it? Guten tag! I know I butchered that. Yep, you did. You put all the dots for no reason. We might be on call a little bit with Zorin today. Zorin helped a lot fixing up the audio engine, so the sounds are a lot better now. Me only partner. Animal Crossing? No. We're on DK64 already. We gotta start putting this coin in, right? Actually we gotta get a decent texture for this coin. Instead of deciding on what the design for this will be. I feel the camera is uncomfortably high at the minimum distance. Like, I wanna put it lower than this. I'll change that. I'm trying to make sure it's not too close to the wall. Hello Hans and Maja, you made white chocolate brownies today. And you used a special ingredient. But did the ingredient is wheat? Is that what I'm getting here? If you guys ever looked into Sly Cooper, I'm really surprised by that video game franchise. We started playing part 1 recently and now we're playing part 2. And the game is actually really good. I feel like the only reason it's not popular is because it's a mascot platform I stuck with on Playstation. And the Playstation is for big adult gamers that like shooty-shooty bang-bang games. Not mascot platformers. I genuinely think it could've been up there with Mario. Well, Mario, but... You know, at least bigger than Crash Bandicoot and maybe Sonic and... Spyro? Fucking Spyro, come on. Okay, that... I like that camera. That's not what we got today. Yoshi House's Zena is working on those. We got Yoshis, but not the houses first. We don't do the bonus stuff, we don't do the camera event yet. Uh, Zena is not finished the old man, so we can't do that yet. Part 1, part 2... Ah, part 8. That is what we got last. Bitch. Did he put them in the leg up after some model starts? I don't remember, but let's check it out. What are you doing? What is that, though? Oh, wait. We do have this. 30 stars. Seems good. 9 entrance, okay. 6 entrance, so... I like that. Okay. Let's do that, the super happy tree seedling. I'm sure an AI could literally do it. I think if you just set up a bot to feed snippets of the codebase into the AI, and you did it in the right order, then you would have a full functional Rust codebase, with maybe a couple bugs, but you can iron those out. Does it claim I have never programmed Rust? I don't know if you actually need to make anything different, because, you know, it's just translating the syntax. I know for C++, you can literally just translate the syntax, and it will just work. Maybe you can even literally just CTRL-C, CTRL-V. Actually, I think Xena started on the super happy tree, so we'll wait for that, too. Dino- Divine Dino Domain. Very secret back entrance. I was thinking there would be an entrance here, and the idea is that it gets you out of here, to the back of Dino Domain. At the same time, this doesn't feel very secret. We need some kind of super secret interaction. Something like a fading warp. We could use literally a fading warp. Like what if standing still between the bamboos here warped you to the back side of Divine Dino Domain? It's very random, though. It feels like people would perceive that as a bug, rather than a feature. Hmm. I don't think that's the play, then. Hello, Kakariko. What the fuck, I don't know what that name is. Welcome to the stream. Okay. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. That's a complicated name. The audio mixing sounds weird. What is wrong? Does my microphone not sound correct? Do I need to pull closer? Is this better? I actually think... we are just going to remove the secret entrance, maybe. When you test the axe on CRT, do you play on a CRT? Yes or no? No, I just play via capture card most of the time. But I will give it a run-through on CRT at the end. No, it's... If it exists, it's going to be a super-secret entrance. Something no player is supposed to do. Can you fix your R2-D2 for Android? No, fix the Android emulator. That's not up to me. Okay. I'm going to fix the Android emulator. I'm going to fix the Android emulator. I'm going to fix the Android emulator. See, what if there is a secret wall behind here that you have to clip through the wall for somehow? You know, that's the kind of secret I'm thinking about. Something like that. Something players realistically will not find. And I just want it to exist so the overworld feels more connected. I don't want people to actually do it. I want people to learn about this in a video essay after the game releases. I want people to tell each other about this on the playground. You know what I mean? That is the idea. Can you make it so you can only crawl from here? Let me get so you could only just crawl from here. But it's not going to work. They might, I'm shaken. I honestly never really perceived a big difference. But I also, for me CRTs are not like this retro device that makes me relive my childhood. They're just like an everyday item to me. So for me the vibe is completely different. I think this idea might just not work. Alright, SurferKoopaDude on Iron Chalice here. Let's see. Let's see, we already stopped here. Let's import the SurferKoopaDude. So, he's going to be chilling here, telling you that he's not like the other Koopas that want to hurt Mauro. He just wants to chill and go to the Shooting Star Festival. But he lost his right. And then after you do the Shooting Star Festival Star, he's like, Ah dang, I chilled so hard, I missed the festival. That's all he does. He just gives you a hint that somewhere around here the Star Festival might happen. Classic NPC, true, classic. We might just have to copy the Chiller, the KoopaChiller. Never had a CRT before? Well, there are a lot of people that say that CRTs don't work. Let's try to duplicate his data. Let's see. Making his eyes bloodshot. That makes him look like he's a fan of Mario. That's a nice beach outfit. What do you guys like to wear on the beach? White? White looks stupid. What if he has two different colors? He's one of the few with two different ones. You know what? It should be green like a Koopa shell. How about that? Maybe this one is less bright. What if he has a slightly pink tank top? Yeah, just like the normal Koopa in Mario 64. He weighs 68 pounds and took up a ton of space. Black, blue. Dark pink. Does he wear black rash shirts? Nah, all the surfers have colorful outfits in this game. This one is just slightly special. I don't like the pink happy hair. Yeah, that's better. Hello, what do you use to convert binary scene into maps for the N64? I use a program called Fast64. Oh, he's omega chilling. He doesn't wear anything. Blue hat, I'm happy with this hat color. What if he has two different colors? He's one of the few with two different ones. How about that? Maybe this one is less bright. Black, blue. Dark pink. Does he wear black rash shirts? Nah, all the surfers have colorful outfits in this game. Black, blue. Dark pink. Does he wear black rash shirts? Nah, all the surfers have colorful outfits in this game. Black, blue. Dark pink. Does he wear black rash shirts? Nah, all the surfers have colorful outfits in this game. Black, blue. Dark pink. No, all the surfers have colorful outfits in this game. Black, blue. Dark pink. Is this music for the second date? What are you doing on the second date? Going to the races? Are you watching horse racing? No, all the surfers have colorful outfits in this game. Black, blue. Dark pink. Is this music for the second date? Are you watching horse racing? No, all the surfers have colorful outfits in this game. Black, blue. Dark pink. No, all the surfers have colorful outfits in this game. Black, blue. Dark pink. Dark pink. Dark pink. Dark pink. Dark pink. Dark pink. Dark pink. I don't say any words, actually. I don't say any words, actually. I would never speak. I would never speak. He doesn't need physics, but he does need this stuff. Ouch, is that the chat meme? Ouch, is that the chat meme? Ouch, is that the chat meme? Oh. What does shot mean? What do you mean by should? What do you mean by new? What do you mean by work? What do you mean by Nintendo? I don't know what to do. Jordan Peterson. Okay, we're gonna have a quick conversation. Hello, one second. Let me change my Discord settings. I have to change the way I'm streaming. One second, I gotta fix my video. I'll be back in one second. Okay. We both have fucked up Discord settings. Okay, is that better? Yes. Do you want me to pull you on stream? Uh, up to you. I'm gonna show this stuff on your end if that's easier for you. I'm just popping you out. Okay. YouTube and Twitch. Yeah, so I have to have you open on YouTube and Twitch and Discord. Because YouTube is so laggy, but that's where I have chat and Twitch. Anyway. Yeah, so the U16 thing, that's just easy fix, no issue. The envelopes, at first I thought it was broken, but I don't actually think it's broken. The white flashing is an OBS issue on my end, I'm sorry about that. There's some Linux compositor issue, because of course there is. You know, things are a lot more stable on Linux than they were 10 years ago, but it's not perfect. So anyway, so a channel has an envelope, a layer has an envelope, and a note has an envelope. And the question is how you get from one to the other. So, when you initialize a channel, you set the channel's envelope to this default envelope. And then that can change when you do channel set envelope, or it can also change well, I'll get to that in a minute, but it can change when you do channel set envelope. Then a layer we're not actually changing the envelope, but we're setting release rate to zero. And you'll see that that later is what triggers using the channel envelope instead. So that should be, like, this is initialized. Even though it's not initializing the envelope to zero, well, I mean, that's not going to help us get a non-null envelope to null the envelope. So, yeah. So then, when does the layer envelope get set? Well, let me get there in a minute. So, yeah. So, first of all, if you play a drum note, it sets the layer envelope to the drum envelope. Right? If you play an instrument note, what it does is where is it? Oh, sorry, it's not if you play an instrument note. If you call layer set instrument, then it's calling get instrument and it's writing the instrument envelope and instrument release rate into this output ADSR, which is the layer ADSR, which is so that's setting layer envelope. So, basically, layer envelope was initially unset and, like, zero as the release rate. If you play a drum note, it sets the envelope every drum note. If you set layer instrument, it changes the envelope. If you don't set layer instrument, which is the normal case, that it's just the channel has an instrument, the layer doesn't have an instrument, then what happens is So, when you call init note for layer, it checks if the layer's release rate was zero, and if it is, then it uses the channel's ADSR setting, which includes envelope and release, and otherwise use the layer's one. So, this would be the normal path for a normal instrument where you can get the envelope from the channel's instrument because there is no layer instrument. So, in all cases, there should be an envelope at this point, and so I move the assert here because this is actually where it should be set to not null, and this is called for every time a note is getting initialized. So, this is coming from either layer envelope or channel envelope. Channel envelope is always initialized to something. Layer envelope could be uninitialized, but if it's uninitialized, then the release rate should also be zero. And then... Okay, so the envelope never gets set without the release rate also being set? Uh... It would be the other way around. The bug would be if you set the release rate and you don't set the envelope. Exactly. Um... But, yeah, release rate, there is no layer set release rate command. There is only a channel set release rate command. So, I think this is a real bug, like memory corruption or something like that rather than a logic issue. Hmm. It's very unfortunate it only happens in Project64, otherwise I could just debug it. Does it happen... Sorry, I'm clipping probably. Um... Okay. It looked like it was on my end. Yeah, so it happens every time on Project64 and it never happens on N64? Exactly. Great. Yeah. Have you tried any other emulators, like Ares or anything? We can try that real quick. Yes, RayMarch, it is Sennheiser HD600. I'll show this to you. Wait, I need to pull you back up. They're fine. Here it is on Project64. And it crashes when you go to the nostalgia level. It crashes no matter where I go. Oh, every level. Yeah, select. Okay. Well, I mean, if it's on Project64 you can just debug it, right? No, this one doesn't have a debugger. Wait, does it? You don't have an emulator? You don't use an emulator that has a debugger? Yes. We're testing. Wait. Does this actually work? I bet as soon as I turn on the debugger it's going to stop crashing. Nevermind. It actually works then, of course. We can just solve it that way. I genuinely did not know this one had a debugger. That's crazy. Okay, yeah. We can just solve it this way. Nevermind. I guess the issue is going to easily be solved. Do you want to do this right now? Up to you. I mean, if you want to do it off-stream you can do it off-stream. Just let me know if there's actually a code bug here that needs to be fixed. It hides the registers by default. This is god-awful. Do you want to move that assertion up to in it note for layer? That's the moment when it's actually you know that it's wrong. Someone in chat says, Kaze, you're really quiet compared to the other person on the call. Hi, everyone. I'm Sorin. I am the programmer for F3Dx3 which is the graphics microcode that Kaze uses, and also been working on the Nostalgia Dynamic music for the Nostalgia level. It turned it down a little bit. Yeah. That's not where this happens. Now we just get a crash. I guess we can just put this everywhere. So, I don't know why Yeah, I don't know why that would be how it would be set there and not be set. Yeah, I guess you can do that. That's not going to be wrong. Yeah. I think you copied a little too much there, but that's all right. Yeah. I guess we can also... The other one too, but that's all right. Did I tell him that his PBR coin colors are clipping in RGB space? Clipping is when you're clipping in RGB space. Clipping in RGB space is the best case scenario on N64. What you don't want is wrapping in RGB space, which the N64 will do sometimes. So, no problem. Or it's not going to look shiny at all. That's like, if I could go back in time and tell SGI to add one tiny five-minute fix to the hardware, that would be it. Please make the... Yeah, so if it's just crashing, can you find out where it's crashing then? Because those should be... I don't know how you would get... Unless it's memory corruption, you shouldn't be able to get the envelope to be null after it has been set. I don't think this is audio code anymore. This is some random other place Oh, never mind, it is audio code. I have just gotten an ad on Twitch, so I can't see what you're doing anymore. Okay, this is the envelope rate where we first were. Okay, I can see YouTube, but it's like a while behind. ... If you don't think this is interesting for your watchers, you can do this later, up to you. It's your stream. I don't think I can deal with it. ... Did you hear that, folks? Kaze says, deal with it. It's something new for them. Yeah, it's only happening in the answer state 1. It doesn't happen anywhere else when we assign this. Well, then, something is getting data corruption. Because, I mean, you looked through the code for where is the word envelope getting set. Yeah, well, unless the release rate is being set without the envelope ever being set. But wouldn't that mean that we never set envelopes? It should hit the assertion where you added the assertion right after that check, where it's line 544 or whatever. Memory corruptions seems somewhat unlikely to me, but it could be in the end. But it would be very unfortunate timing. I think it's best I just look at this off-stream. I don't think we're going to figure this out right now. Okay, so, yeah, the other thing in terms of future work. So, what I really refactored here was note handling. But there is still the script reading, which I had talked about, hey, maybe I can make the code size smaller. Part of that being because layers, channels, and sequences all have the same handling for end, call, loop, jump, all those things. So, maybe I can hack something together that actually uses the same code for them. I was talking about doing stuff like a microcode decoder. So, instead of having a case statement, which is loading one word for every jumping to it, you would load let's say a byte or 16 bits for each command, and then you have just the same code that executes that says if bit one is set, do this. If bit two is set, do this. If bit three is set, do this. And then some of the things would be read the next value from the sequence and push this on the stack and whatever, and then you can build each command by combining those individual operations. I'll have to figure out how to do that for the more complicated ones like this. I'll be able to express that as some microcode that you have to actually jump to the code for that. I'm hoping that this will help both with your goal of getting rid of all the decomp code here, as well as reducing the code size because a lot of this is the same thing over and over. Do you predict any issues with converting old sequences to the new format that way? Well, what I was talking about was just I would parse the exact same sequence. The command definitions would all be the same. Oh. I thought you had to change the bits of the commands then. Oh, you mean actually have the command itself be the microcode. I meant you look up the command ID in a table and then you pull out the 16 bits and then you iterate through those bits. Okay, I see. The command itself being the bits would be better, I think. I mean, that would be kind of sick, but if we're going for hey, let's just totally rewrite the, you know, make a new similar but new actually scripting language, with Seq64 that's kind of possible because you just use the GUI and you edit all the command definitions and then you can just reimport everything. You could even import binary sequences, save them as MusicMacroAssembly with Seq64, then change the definition, then import the MusicMacroAssembly and export it as binary again. Yeah, I'm already kind of... So you can just make an automatic converter between them, use it without having to write any new code. That's what I thought your plan was. Okay, I mean, that's not something I can just say I want to do that this weekend or whatever. Right, of course not. But maybe, that would really be like, okay, we're getting rid of all the code. But let's assume for one second you implement your plan. Wouldn't it then be a very simple next step that I can just do to replace all the command definitions with the microcode table that you were suggesting? But there's a lot more design to be done there. We want to, if you're making all of those changes, we want to optimize what command, put all the command IDs next to each other and decide, oh, we have a command that does this and this, why don't we just break that up into being two commands. It's not just like a rote translation. Okay, I see. Yeah, that sounds like more work if you wanted to do that too. Right, I mean, it's not like, because it's more work, I want to do it. It's like, because we have the opportunity to fix this. If we're totally rewriting it, we can do other things. First of all, this whole play percentage thing, this is just like decomp named things wrong. What they're calling play percentage is the total length, and what they're calling duration is the percentage length. So they've just swapped the names. So there's a bunch of trash in here that needs to be cleaned up. But yeah, we could do, okay, we have this command encoding space. We want to maximize the encoding space. We can change things so that, for example, it has, I was thinking about this in the shower two months ago. I don't remember all the details, but something like, hey, you have one byte for your note lengths, and it's a more quantized length, because most commands are going to actually be in that, most notes are a nice round number of beats or quarter notes or whatever, and so you can have your first command basically assigning the space of bytes to the data in a better way. You can have things like what is play percentage, but not actually play percentage. Well, gate time have just one encoding that just has a few options that's shorter, and you end up having the sequences' sizes actually being smaller. Okay. So if we're rewriting it, we should actually just rewrite the whole thing and redesign the whole thing, which is fun, right? For me, it's also about backwards compatibility at this point. I mean, yeah, you gotta make your decision on that. That's, you know, your whole thing was sort of throwing out Nintendo backwards compatibility, but now you have your own corpus of intellectual property that you have to retain backwards compatibility with. Yeah. I mean, at least for the sequences stuff, hopefully you have the MIDI file versions of everything, and so it is just a matter of, like, have a script that iterates over all of them and calls 664 on all of them and produces the binaries. Well, we do have MIDI files, but they still need to be edited after being imported into 664 to convert in a way that sounds satisfactory. You do the editing of that at the music macro language level? For music sequences? I don't have an ear for music. I can't do this. But I know ZeroVault does. ZeroVault does, okay. Is he using the Mario64 toolchain, or is he using 664? He's using 664. I think that is the Mario64 toolchain at this point. No, the Mario64 toolchain is, well, for MIDI import, people use it, but people use it to just convert to binary, and then the Mario64 toolchain, they have their own assembler-disassembler. Really? There's just GNU assembler with a crap ton of macros being defined, and the disassembler is a Python script, but they have some limitations of that. As long as you have either the MIDI or the music macro assembler source for each of these files, we can then script things. But if we want to make substantial changes to what defines a note and what things go in that note definition, then you have to do the MIDI import step again. You can't just, at least for that music stuff, you can't just convert over. Anyway, maybe I'll start with the simple version, and we'll see how many weeks it takes me to do that. It will be awesome either way. I didn't expect it to all that work. Well, I mean, it's a really great opportunity to get to work on this. I did Triforce% I got to make the Ocarina of Time. It's making its full complete version, and you're sort of making the true version of Mario 64 here. It's a privilege to be able to work on that. Whenever people talk about arbitrary code execution or ask what it is, I still send them the Triforce% run. I mean, it was one of the most fun I've had in my life. Again, I apologize for the viewers for all of the white flashing. I have some OBS problems on Linux. Okay, I mean, that's really what I wanted to talk about here. I've been working on a video about the sequence, and I'm actually trying to do high effort with editing and everything, so that's been also taking some of my time. Soren, when do we get your two-hour programming lecture? I mean, you've just gotten like 20 minutes of it, and if you go to my channel, you can get another half hour of RSP programming lecture. Yeah, so anyway, I got to get back to that video. I wanted to ask, how do you do it for your videos? Because you have a very good editor, but a very good editor does not automatically generate content. You still have to create all of the graphics. You have to create all the game captures. Anything you actually want to be on screen, you have to make it yourself. So isn't the editor only doing 20% of the work and you're still doing 80% of the work? I'm not sure if I would say 80-20. It depends on how much effort the editor is really putting into it. I do grab all the footage and the graphics, but they put them together and they add the animations between the footage. Sometimes I don't know what to put, and they add a funny video or something in the meantime to fill the empty air. It's kind of how it works. I script the video, and then after I scripted the video, I plan out all the footage. I start again to see if maybe I can improve something, and then I just record the footage, record the voice, and send it over. Okay, but when you have animated graphics and stuff, are you making each of the individual graphical elements in the animated graphics and sending those over, and the editor is just doing, like, okay, have this thing fly in? Or is the editor making all of the content also? No, they're not making any content. They're just having the animations. Okay. Yeah, I mean, to me that sounds... Right. I mean, yes. You also have the skill with that, so I did a bunch of this stuff for this video in Google Slides. Just like, okay, have something move over or click to advance the slides, but oh well. I mean, I'm trying to do this with minimal effort, right? Like, I'm trying to... Yeah, I'm trying to... It's... Viewers always love to hear, hey, I spent a month on this video and it was so much fun, but actually I'd rather have been spending the time on actually, like, making a new thing, but this is too good of an opportunity to pass up on explaining how this was done. Yeah, that's exactly why I have an editor. I hate editing too. Yeah, alright. So, let me know where you get on the envelope and I'll let you know where I get on the sequence parsing stuff. Yeah, I probably don't have time tomorrow, but maybe I can finish it by Monday evening. No rush. It's your bug. It's not affecting me on real N64 here, so. Yes, fair enough. But I mean, maybe it's related to your code, so I'm sure you'd like to know. Yeah, I want to know in case it was actually my fault. Okay, yeah. Good to chat. Alright. Anything else we need to talk about? We're all done? Not right now, I guess. Alright. I'll see you around then and I'll get back to you in a new moment. Bye-bye. Yeah, thank you. Bye. Here we go. So, if this idea comes true and we end up having a whole custom code for the sound engine, that would be so cool. That would mean that if we ever had a proper commercial release of RTYI as like a custom CD, we would not have to remake all the music, basically. Because as it stands right now, the sound engine is still, I would say, 75% Mario 64. So, we can't use the sound engine. I'm not very good with computer history claiming. Hmm. It's gonna be something like this. It's this B-part one. Oh, actually, dude, we are now beyond 512 texts. I forgot. Now that I think about it, I should make a new one. It's silly, but it works. Yeah. Yeah, you can tell me. 5.5, okay. Wir werden spielen. Und das darauf. And then this is out. I also changed how the dialogues work. Do you see this? Now we can just define the sound here. Just do this. It saves a lot of time. Hmm. What's the text? Hmm. It's not like this. Hmm. I don't know. How do you say my like a cool guy? Hmm. I lost my wimp for real for real. No, that sounds wrong. This is a 90s game. Nevermind. You have to justify whatever sentence you want to put here to a 1996 Nintendo executive. Should we still put that in there? But I lost my whip. My whip? Wasn't there like an MTV show called Whip My Ride or something? Ride My Whip? That feels very fitting. Oh my god, have you guys ever seen the ending of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater? The ending credits? That is such like strong 90s MTV energy. That is the completely wrong text. I didn't change this. Pimp my ride. Oh, that's what it was. But then it's just ride and not whip. Why didn't I set it as else instead of else if? Why here? Because it literally doesn't fucking matter. It's the same thing. It's just the same thought. It just happens to not ride it that way. No, you're overthinking it. The reason is that it doesn't matter and I just ended up typing it that way. I probably typed this line first and then I typed an else and opened the brackets and then I noticed that I actually only did it in the else condition. This is definitely more laggy than I thought. This is often... Dude, oh my god, we need to talk about programming discourse on Twitter. It's the worst. People that talk about programming on Twitter just... crucify them. This reminds me of that. That's the wrong text. Is this just a little longer? Oh, I forgot the promise function. Okay, here we go. What's the story? Here's my story. In 2006, I was in middle school. This kid was looking for off-brand Google websites. The last website he went to was the website Goggle. It ended up screwing up the entire school's computer system. We had to get all the micro-data and everything. I don't believe it. That sounds like it got screwed anyway. And you just thought that was the reason. Let me just go on Twitter. And we'll find the first programming discourse on here. I'll let you show my Twitter. This is what my Twitter looks like. This is all awful. Where's the programming Twitter posts? Nevermind, there's no programming on here. I wanted to show you guys cringe, but it's just random stuff. Who's that? You don't need to apologize. That was a good question. Generally, I have no idea who that is. I don't follow anyone on Twitter. But no, half the time on Twitter, it's people talking about what the best programming language is. I went on to Twitter once. I check my Twitter once a day to see my notifications. And every time, it opens up to the homepage. The thing I saw today was someone posting C is the best programming language 20 times, and it got shorter and shorter. And then it started saying C++ is the best programming language, and it got longer and longer. It's like, what the fuck are we doing here? Is this a mantra you shout to yourself? What are you trying to achieve? Are you trying to convince yourself of something? What? It's like Bart Simpson writing shit during the Simpsons intro. I will not misbehave. It doesn't work. That's the vibe I get. That's the vibe of someone desperately trying to convince themselves of something they believe not to be true. You shouldn't start a new computer. Why? Can't you just start a C++ project and then program in C the whole time? Who cares? I mean, who cares? What do you lose from doing that? Nothing. No, I think I don't like how far away the island is. Seems like another strict superset of C. Not strictly, but, I mean, come on. It's like saying a Nintendo Wii is not a strict superset of a Nintendo GameCube. Like, yeah, you can't use the Game Boy attachment, but, like, who cares? Are you gonna play Game Boy games on your Nintendo GameCube? Wait, did did did Did Did Did Did oh wait, that's part of the language? I thought the compiler we use at work was just being a bitch. That's annoying. I think I've always seen NPF as the densest area in the world, when we use our special brain. I'm not too deep into it. NPF? Is that something that is like a spray can? I guess. Yeah, I guess the language is still evolving. I mean, just an updated compiler would be fine. That happens in C too. There was an update in GCC that made it so you're not allowed to declare variables in switch cases anymore. Annoying as hell. NPF is generally move-constructable, so I guess that's obvious. What kind of program is this? That sounds like you're just moving data from one place to another. Hm. I'm not entirely happy with this. No, but is it a compiler that doesn't detect it? I guess I'll take that. That doesn't sound like ADHD or something. That sounds like the concept of happiness. The ability to form habits. Oh, I see. That's crazy, then, actually. That's like a thing that can happen. You can infect your entire thing? That link could be gargled. Yeah, that's good. Do you guys believe in one-click exploits? As in, websites where the only thing you do is click on them can get you hacked? I used to be a non-believer, but I'm a believer nowadays. Do you also believe they exist? I have always been of the opinion that people that think that the language to program in, maybe they're a little bit losers. And this belief is founded. It's not unfounded. It's because every time I have to program in a different language, it's just googling syntax a little bit more, and everything else is the same. I remember someone commissioned me to write a program that would take a Mario 64 ROM, like a ROM hack, and it would tell you how many stars are there in it, and what the stars are called and stuff. And I had to write it in PHP. And this was my first day of writing in PHP, and it was very easy. I just had to google the file read functions, and then I was basically done. The rest was just logic. My school had all the computers taken over by some virus for like two weeks. I think it was the entire school just to get infected. Wow. Some of them are imperative languages. I had to write in Haskell before. I don't know whether Haskell is an imperative language or not, but I know Haskell is different. I could tell Haskell felt very different. It felt more like I had to write a math formula that returns the desired value rather than writing in a normal program. Okay, I will admit Haskell is very different, and it's not the same as like PHP and C and Java and C++. Hello Brad Cronove, I'm glad you think that. I'm putting a lot of work into this. This feels wrong, but apparently they really are still that far apart. Huh. Oh, it's because of this vertex here. There's a really bad accent when I'm doing the performance over something here. Even for performance, it's just like, you know, compile languages basically all have the same performance, and scripted languages all have worse performance. Or, not scripted, uh, integrated, that's the word. At least, unless the compiler is bad. I mean, obviously if the compiler is bad, then that's a different issue. Like, formal proof solvers, purely function stuff. Oh, like a formal proof solver makes sense in Haskell, so, gee, I suppose so. He wrote something in a language like Python or Lua, which I didn't really understand, but if you switch your computer performance, yeah. Rock or cock. You can't tell me rock and cock, I'll be able to look up the languages. See, Meem talked about it a lot, yeah, me too. Kids these days love that stuff. Yeah, that's a common fucking Twitter IT topic too. I compared programming languages to see how they differ in speed, and it's like, why are C and C++ different speeds? Bro, what are you doing? You're hiding something here. The greatest language I've ever used? Probably EI84Basic, or whatever the fuck it's called. C++7 on Restrict? That's crazy. Surely, though, you can write any program that needs Restrict without using Restrict, right? Or any program that would benefit from Restrict, you can write in a way where it doesn't need Restrict to get the same benefits. Yeah, but, no, I mean, you can do the optimization yourself. Without needing the Restrict keywords. Oh, I've done it before in C before I knew the Restrict keyword existed. I just can't prove it, you can do it every time, that's why I'm asking. I didn't do that, I cheated. Just a little bit of pointer manipulation. Angry AI, you guys are just fucking putting together four letters at this point and pretending it's a programming language. I'm not falling for it. You're just copying the data in a specific way and the idea is to point those keywords. Yeah, I don't need to see it. It was in one of my really old videos. Copying pointer on the stack doesn't actually happen, as long as you copy the pointer in the code. It's fake, it's not real when you do that, officially. Unless the compiler fucks up. Right, well, not entirely. You could do something like, assume pointer 1 plus 0x100 less than pointer 2. And then, you know, like this stuff you could do. I actually do have the assume keyword. You see this? Wait a second, wait a second. What if... Wait. I have my allow assert thing. What if we change this to be... If allow asserts, then we do this and otherwise, we use the assume macro. This is the assume macro. That should work. Okay, so the seal here is going to be stuck in the sand at first. And you just cancel the pointer until you get to the view and then it doesn't matter what the types are. What do you mean? We can use this as a struggle animation. He uses this to struggle while he's in. And then you grab the tail and he gets stuck in this animation and you mash the A button a little bit. And then he flips. And then he flips again to shoot into the island. So we need all three animations. Who wrote the DK64 OST? Please tell me it was Dave Weiss. Please tell me it was Dave Weiss. It was Dave Weiss, right? Okay, come on. It was Frank Urquhart. Who am I? He also did Donkey Kong's voice? Oh my god. I need to delete this animation. I don't know if this animation is possible. I mean, I suppose that would depend on the program, right? I mean, if you really wanted, you could write your C++ in a way where it almost 1-to-1 matches the assembly instructions. I mean, I suppose that would depend on the program, right? I don't know. I don't know. Yes, that's true. Yes, that's true. So whenever someone posts one of these comparisons of programming languages where C or C++ have different speeds, can we just respond that they would be the same speed if you were a better programmer? Nah, I think yes. If it's something like iterating a for loop, I think yes. What is should? I can't answer this question because I don't know what should means. I can't answer this question because I don't know what should means. I can't answer this question because I don't know what should means. I can't answer this question because I don't know what should means. From a development standpoint, almost certainly yes. Unless you're actually dealing with a very performance critical section, which I imagine is very very rare. So I would say in 99.9% of the cases, yes. If it's an optimization GCC miss, that probably is a micro optimization. Or maybe it's not even an optimization and you just don't know that well about the target architecture. I think that's vastly more likely than you found in optimization GCC miss in a simulation or something. Especially when you're developing for multiple architectures. Is the answer that you set which parts of the RAM are cached and which parts are not? No. Or, well, kind of. You can use the ncache pointer by setting the 2000000 bit. So if you read or write from that, it still goes to RAM, but it never gets cached. But it doesn't change the ability of that part of RAM to go into cache. You can actually just decide which parts of memory are mapped into the cache. That's crazy. That would be kind of fun, but we're fine for now. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That would be extremely useful, actually, for this. Because sometimes we have places that are just rarely used flags. I want to just say you can never be in cache. That would be pretty helpful. Have you guys ever played the Hitman games? Are they good? I'm thinking of playing one. I think we'll either play that or 100% Ocarina of Time next. I'm a bit worried that it's just gonna be shit again. A lot of these Playstation franchises that are famous franchises turned out to be just awful when I tried them. I have a hatred for Rockstar games that one could only have after playing a Rockstar game. I need to change its pitch. Oh, there's also some code there for 64. Let me think. I kind of need them to be like this. 135. Okay, that's easy. That's... every child knows this is 06060. Will non-copyrighted assets also be public by chance? There's a chance even the copyrighted ones will be public. But we will have to see. This is one thing I'm worried about. I do want people to be able to contribute to this project. And to look at it and maybe even suggest improvements for performance or code or to fix bugs. But I also know how these community projects go. I know people are going to try to add 10 million different options. I know people are going to add random bloat to the game. This is a thing people routinely do with the video games. They're turning this into a video game that you can only like if you have already liked the video game. Where you need to be familiar with the base game to appreciate the new additions. And a new player would be completely distraught by those. And I want to prevent that from happening. But I'm not sure I can if this is a public project. I think it's going to work for a while. And I'm going to keep saying no when the content is to the game. And then people are going to make branches of the game. And there's going to be so many branches. And then people are going to tell people to play this branch instead of the vanilla game. You wouldn't be the power request reviewer? Why not? I think we're going to have a problem here. Yeah. I think there's just no way to stop that. I'm not asking mods to branch far beyond the base game. I'm saying what people will do is they will add improvements to the game that are not improvements for new players. I'm just telling the improvements for people that already have played the game. Yes, I would be the reviewer. But people would still make branches for me regardless. And they'd be like, fuck this tyranny from the people that gave us the game. Here is our real beta version of Casuino Beta. Well, yes. Then it's definitely one of R6 Wonder's final battles. Aspect ratio 4 to 3, press L to switch. I get it. I would feel that way too. Yeah. Yeah. The big problem with the thing I mentioned is that the people that would be into the game wouldn't maybe even like this version more. I would recommend this to new people. They would have a worse experience with it. If, for example, you ask Mario 64 modding fans whether to play the original or remake before, a lot of them might tell you to play one of the Star Revenge games before. And I just don't think that would be as enjoyable as the original game. I might have to go for 0x1800. Who's a cuck, what? Is someone calling me a cuck? What the hell is going on in the chat right now? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hmm. Hmm. Honestly, I don't see why this is not working right now. Oh, we might just not be able to get close enough. That's probably what's going on. Let's see how close we can get. Yep, exactly, SLX. That's what I'm talking about. You understand. 244. Hey Zelda. I can't believe it's only 340. It felt like we already did the whole day of work on here. I found recently that there's people out there that play Sonic Adventure 2 that play Sonic Adventure 1. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's a good one. Hmm. Hmm. I see, that makes sense. YXCAL. And I kinda see it. The problem is, I don't have a playlist. So, what can I do? Maybe we should make a stream playlist. Okay, that was closer to what we needed. You know how to program on the N64? I'm trying to get into Sega Saturn PS1. It just kinda came to me. Honestly, it didn't do anything. It just worked with the decomp. I had the craziest conversation while I was streaming. I want to show this to you. This is me showing off. Do you see this? This guy is just like, here's 24 numbers. And I'm telling him exactly what he did wrong with those 24 numbers. That's crazy. Maybe doing numbers. You guys didn't even notice. No. It is not. Most of LibUltra is removed. Some of LibUltra is likely rewritten. A lot of LibUltra is literally still there. But DeathWizard is planning to rewrite LibUltra. Or not even LibUltra. Like make an entirely new library that's compatible with 3D microcodes. So we will use that. LibUltra is awfully optimized. The functions that I have written so far are like 75% wasteful. Hello boy. You know what, we should do this differently. Give it a little bit of this. What the fuck am I doing? This is what I wanted. This approaches zero. You know what, let's save that for later. NintendoSwift, I don't want to be happy. What else did she do? Okay, so after you spend so much time on radar maximum, can you explain what is the next bar? It's probably high gravity compared to many other games that help a lot. It's also that a lot of moves have weight. If I want to turn around, you see how long it takes. A lot of games nowadays have a lot of double jump moves and stuff. I call them double jump slop. Any game you have, you can just add a double jump to it and it becomes so much more digestible. It's so easy to minimize the frustration. Oh, I can't make it by the double jump. I agree, but it's appropriate. Interesting. That's the RageBeta account. That's not a woman, that's a guy. You got mad at King Joffrey and started writing angry tweets at the actor. So when is she using Windows 10 or 11? I had to. But yeah, it's not real. I don't like that it's updating the actor's position. I don't like this. There we go. Hey! Oh, that looks awesome. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I can't believe you have this much text now. It can be the same. Yeah, it's frustration minimization. You can't risk frustrating the player. It's lowest common denominator bullshit. It's like chicken nuggets. Nevermind, it's someone's favorite. I accidentally made clean. Chicken nuggets are your favorite, I knew it. You don't need more studios like Devolver Digital, because you're not gonna starve for thought time. You're not gonna die, it's not gonna end humanity. It's a rhetorical technique called lying. Ah, slop! Okay, that works. And now we just need to be able to jump on her and then she will shoot us to the level. Mario wasn't as spooky as this. I actually like instant ramen, but only uncooked. Like you don't cook it, you just put the spices and the noodles together and eat them like chips. You're not a real gamer? Good. You want to play good games, not just slop? I doubt it. Your words are not consistent with your actions, assuming you are the one speaking for all the gamers right now. Is that the horrifying thing Mario has to deal with every time he goes into a pipe? Yeah, every time you go into the pipe you have to confront Mario's inner world and his trauma related to pipes. Is this a quirky indie game about depression? What did you think it was? I don't know. Hmm. Hmm. I'm going nuts, what is this song? It's the tech barrel. I missed it, shit. Did it not play a sound? I'm sorry if I missed it. How many did you gift? Oh, I'm on restream, it doesn't show me things happening in Twitch chat. I thought that would be a notification. How many things did I miss if I don't hear notifications? Thank you for the gift subs, very appreciated, even if I didn't see it right away. Damn, I'm the worst streamer. Gifted 5 again, yo, thank you. Gifted 5 again, yo, thank you. I know this is a lot of copycat, but it's fine. The feet text? Honestly, my feet are no secret, I'm always barefoot. Oh my god, do you think people ever saw me outside barefoot and just snap pictures of my feet? I actually go to Sandman's Sandbox in the grocery store, but I have gone to the grocery store barefoot a lot of times before. I'm kind of giving up. There we go, this is what I want, and I want the game server. I need to send this thing's IParam to the web ID for Cooper812, which I think I already mentioned is 0x109? Maybe? Let's see if it works. There's a menu on wikifeet, what? The fact you guys know that a website called wikifeet exists is sus. It didn't come back to me sending feet pics, it came back to me being asked for feet pics. Very, very different scenario. Okay, that's kind of good. Not even interfering in either end of it? You're sacrificing yourself to defend your comrades? That's admirable. Okay, that's good. This didn't seem to work at all though. Oh my god, this seems like he's not actually rotating to Mario, and I don't know why. Slower? I'm not sure, maybe a slight bit. Let's play around with it a little bit. Was there something else? He seemed to not rotate, why would that be? Yeah, he's not facing Mario. I definitely do not want Mario to land in the water. Does he rotate now? No. Still need him to be higher. When you use define over const variables, because define puts them in code and const variables can be variables instead of hardcoded. This is better performance-wise. I don't see why it would ever not rotate to Mario. Unless I've cached the position? Maybe not. Okay. Maybe it's not all move angles that I need, right? Unless make talkable somehow... Oh, make talkable does set the flag to copy the move jaw to the face jaw, because talking to a talkable actor changes the move jaw to the face jaw. He should rotate now. Not what I want. Do I need more? The offset is set to 0. I don't think it needs an offset. Wait. No, it's set to 0. Nevermind, it should be fine. I think it would be more comedic if you went fast as fuck, but also just instantly warped. Something like this. Let's see if this works this time around. I never actually tested talking to this. Okay, that's good. I like it. But you can't even see the animation. That's funny, but you can't see the animation. So that's not good. Maybe I can speed up the animation with this guy. I don't know. I don't know. We'll do that. Actually, let's hook him up better. Okay, that looks terrible now. I ruined the animation. I can make it a little faster, but not that fast. What if you know the vision mode? We don't shot Mario this time, so that's... We can't have a deal in this instance. Buh-bye! Not setting its animation earlier. That's not... No. Now! My project's name used to be Mario 64. I played a video game called Games Online and became a 1-4-1 in Germany. That's where I learned to play Mario 64. And before that, I made games on my computer that didn't score. Okay, that's almost perfect. It doesn't need to be that extreme speeds. Maybe we can turn it on a little bit. It's so funny. I don't like that speed. I think it's the right speed. I think I should close it. Okay, perfect. So now, the shield should no longer be stuck on the side. Because we've been in trouble once. Let's see if it's true. Well, we have to enter this level at least six times. Five times. So... Give enough shots to seal it. You know, I never checked that the quick attacks was actually the correct one. Let's do that this time. Wait. It's not stuck. Oh no, it's not stuck. It's just inanimate. Good. That's all we need. Well, that should be enough. All right, we finished the entire seal today. The entire level entrance. There we go, dudes. Change the side. There's the seal. All right. Next would be another psych level. And that would be Aza's level. If we're still doing that. The VVC emulator won't work with this hack, right? Yes, it's not going to work. And even if it did work, I don't think the Wii is powerful enough to play this game. Oh, Badoob sent me a new version of the Freedom Tree for the course. I just want to love the number of these. Hmm. You know, this is a strange song. I've never listened to it. I don't know what it is, but let's see. It could be number 8. The vibe here is pretty good, I think. But there was a color thing about the previous song, I think. I can tell you what that is. Yeah, it sounds much better. I didn't know this tune could be great. It's coming from all around the place. The music's all over my voice. Oh. Well, I turned it down a little bit. This would be for this entire level here. I have a tough time with this. This wasn't really present in the previous version either, but a melody you can hum would be awesome in this. And it sounds a little thin. I feel like maybe we could have one stream drumline to solve that. But I feel like it's just a single stream drumline, just like in the overworld song, I think. It wouldn't sound thin to me anymore. But the vibe is so perfect. It feels like autumn, right? Does this song feel like autumn to you guys too? A kalimba full of wood feeling. I don't know what a kalimba is. But maybe. Let me finish Crusade before I get back to this. I always need to listen to songs like two or three times. Is this fun for you guys too? Like the first time you watch a movie, it's always not that good. But then the second time, it's way better. Or is that just a me thing? I feel the same thing with songs. The second time I listen to a song is the real time. That's when it actually counts. No? I'm the only one like that? Thank you for watching! XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD I have never watched a minecraft movie with a modern galaxy movie. There's a modern galaxy movie? Is that like the second mario movie? Is that what you're talking about? I really should make this so that there's just one level up for things. But, oh well. Now I have to deal with this. I guess it's fine. That's the first song. This is another song that Luke makes. Except I don't like this one before. Ah, missing warp. Did we not export this? I don't think we exported this. Hey, it works! We finished this level entrance fully. Nice. That's another part of the overworld done. Alright. Thank you for the 10 bits. Thank you for your money. Kiddo. That was an idea? A possibility? I'm not sure why we're doing that. Hmm. Then after that, the rainbow slide with the athlete Yoshi. At that point we kinda need the huts. And then Marty's side level. Which we also cannot do yet. Actually we don't need the Yoshi for the huts. Yeah, we can do the rainbow slide then. We can look into Asa's side level. Anyway. That will be it. And I will see you guys in the next stream whenever that may be. I might be streaming more next week because I have a week off work. So, until then. Bye bye!
