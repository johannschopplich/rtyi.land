Video games hello sorry what happened someone donated wow i love video games thank you for the sub oh sorry i didn't see who it was so i was kind of working on this off stream because this doesn't work right right now me hello stone to barkman  i think i've seen you being mentioned on threatened activator from today nice we do like cloud in here cool fun bro thank you yeah look how the penguins are lagging behind for one frame that's an issue so i want to fix that and then we'll go back to overall do stuff okay i think i'm gonna write a nice on ai art after seeing so much low effort business use i'd rather breath and wind with the most grotesque stitch ever it's like three layers of front teeth i don't know who stitches but that sounds pretty bad dude lila i actually have something a million times worse what you're describing doesn't sound like business use you know what i saw i went to a barber and the barber had the sign in front of his shop that said like baroubra and it was clearly like an ai generated plaque so i went to the baroubra and got my hair cut i should have taken a picture dude dude that would have been such a banger tweet i should have just taken a picture of that and been like dude i'm gonna get the most fucked up haircut of all time yeah they didn't even get the correct text yeah exactly or maybe they tried to get the correct text and it was just not possible oh hello ghana genuinely i do not see why this is being an issue right now and that's pretty bad shit unless the issue is that one of these is not being factored in that could be it dude i like behind if i go up and down no it looks like roll is not factored in and that's the issue or factored in wrong what if i disable roll so this is whatever this idiotic yep it was an old person okay no the issue is still there what if it's jaw then okay guess what chicken butt so are you doing a rework right now yeah we are reworking this area here because it sucked hey there we go oh that's sick yeah i think this is gonna be a lot more fun than what we had before that's what we had before kind of sucked and then we're gonna make it so that you take damage from the stuff so the goal will be to get to the end without taking as much damage instead of the time limit  yeah you're not gonna be walking around as mario anymore this guy has also been changed he no longer just talks to you you guys know you guys want to see peak game design peak game design is this guy i throw you maybe you hit the star there's no reason for this to exist it's just there because fun and you know people are gonna try this you know simpleflips is gonna play this and be like i can't i can't quit until i get this right so kinda lame well it's not one-off though this is the exact same physics as the super mario land retro section has so this exists twice now it's the exact same plane physics yep that's exactly what it is shadow boy it is literally the same code just different visuals it's very nice and fun well the unfortunate facts of the situation is that we need something and now we have something so what you're gonna do also dude have you guys seen this video oh my god it's doing so well we're getting so much fame okayo has wanted an 800 000 view video since the day we started working together and i think he's finally getting it i'm gonna fight you you would lose you realize that right there's like no shot on hell you would win the fight so welcome back lila you've been gone for a bit how dare you  we were all missing you every day you weren't here after till he came and he was like i miss lila i want to bully lila he wants you so bad so there's only lies always here and it pissed me off this is true trust me oh and then when you weren't here he missed you you know in german there's a saying like uh something something lois like to squabble with each other i don't know how it goes  you guys are secretly each other's biggest fan the video is great and i'm now going to not read the timers unless i need to see what happens interesting hello salami so hey if i remember correctly you prefer to be called arrow instead of salami but salami is a much funnier name especially with the cat profile picture there's no way lila can you hold salami do we make these 3d bridges i think we do i think 2d bridges are gonna look poopy you can even use the same material as here sorry brain worm one two three four five six should bark next time it would be so funny and i totally wouldn't clip it we're not barking here this music classic even better when cats sing it so how is 10 sized indents too small yes if you're gonna name yourself salami people will call you salami that is what's going to happen dude this is also a very malleable song so maybe i should start a real podcast all by myself i love saying stupid stuff on the internet with no one stopping me i would be a great podcaster so let me get a vibe check on this oh yeah beta test 1 of course 4 is done it happened this weekend the level overall seems decent except the bugs sucked and the plane mission sucked so i think we can make a good game out of quest 4 which surprised me i thought quest 4 was kind of bad he said i'm growing an addiction to your content so i don't even want to hear it i shiver every day until a new video is posted once the side of your donation happens i shed tears of joy well you better pray that squarespace keeps paying up because as long as squarespace pays i'm probably gonna make a video every two weeks i was not making fun of it i just asked you to fix it how is everything making fun of you lila can't have a normal conversation without people going like oh they're making fun of me come on man okay this wood looks really nice but i don't like the way this works which one is quest 4? the zoo because of my ego it's just a joke your ego is a joke i think i need a curve here because i remember about someone come about me speak good english hello how are you hello why can i not snap to this piece of shit okay alright for the rich and zen enough to have this technology we could have had stairs and L&T true is salami a regular? salami was a regular like a long time ago but he no longer is do you have much more rdp bonds than rsp bonds? you could have done that yeah probably  so we're just going to make a new bridge because the old one sucked balls where's my curve so you See how steppy this bridge is? I don't like it. This new bridge will be so much smoother. Eugh. Yeah, I'm going to be figuring out when they told me storm engineers are using textures for stairs from a thing where you see a two-stair texture. I don't know why I'm doing this. Okay, uh, something's very wrong with this curve. I think I was supposed to use a Beziert's curve. That is already a million times better. This is difficult. I think this should do it. What do you think of my bridge? Much better, right? Do you fuck with Blady? Who's Blady? Yep, that was my experience too. Swedish rapper? How would I have heard of Blady? I don't know anything about Swedish rap, obviously. He was really popular a few years ago. Well, I am just not very familiar with culture, so. All right, what do you think of my bridge now? How's that? Smooth as hell. As a rapper yourself, you should. I should know every rapper. You're my favorite rapper, thank you. Missing railings, of course, of course. That's the word I mean. The railings are missing on purpose, just so we can leave a friendly love bridge. I don't buy her back. Thank you for the bridge compliment, buy her back. Wait, you actually can't swim, Lina? Wow. No, I can't. We talked about your ability to swim before. Why would I remember that someone is able to swim? That is so unnoteworthy. Who cares if you're able to swim? I would only care if you were unable to swim. You call me a baby and stuff. I call you a baby all the time. Yo, it's Mario 64 and music. Okay, I want that to be properly spaced. So I am going to increase this by one percent. Another one percent. There we go. You cried when I called you a baby. I believe you. We still have ideas for overworld buildings. I had a cool idea that would streamline some things a little. We could definitely use a few more overworld building ideas, I think. I don't think there's a desperate need for them, but we don't have like many building ideas right now. But if there's something cool, I'll definitely take note of it. Hit the Trump Tower. I realized today that I should write the art of the deal part 2 because I bought $80 of Yu-Gi-Oh cards because we wanted to play Yu-Gi-Oh. Then I took out the cards I wanted and I sold the rest for $230. Dude, like just like five or six more Yu-Gi-Oh flips and I'm a billionaire. One meter in Blender is one unit of R64. Well, it's not meter. One unit in Blender is one unit of R64. It was really stunning what you can do with R64. I mean, imagine trying to suppress it 15 years ago. True. You got 50 Giga. Exactly. I made 150 bucks and I got like, I still have like 2,000 cards left over. What are you doing? 3D modeling? Alright, that's just with manga and he makes insane money. Does he have a pawn shop? That sounds like a pawn shop. Will I buy a mod retro N64? I have a feeling I won't need to buy one. I have a feeling they will just send me one so I can make a video about it. Just think about it. If you actually made a good product and I asked you, hey, can you send me a copy so I can review it? Wouldn't you send it to me before release? So I can like tell people, hey, this is actually good. I firmly believe if someone does not send me a free copy of the N64 FPGA, they're doing some shady shit and their FPGA is probably garbage. That's a bad railing. Remembers collectible by the boxed out from deceased estate auctions and sells them individually. Yeah, I imagine that's a lot of work, but also good money. I don't have a big ego, Leela. I have no ego at all. In fact, I can entirely objectively evaluate anyone's criticism of me. Room modded Switch's storage is going to be self-destruct for Nintendo. Yeah, so my uncle actually works at Nintendo and he told me what they do is they put enriched uranium into like a part of the Switch 2 graphics card. And when it detects that you modded the game, just like a special 3D model file they have and once they send that to the graphics card, that is just like a nuclear blast that goes off in your living room. Do I misremember you once commenting that Everdrive can't run your mod or something? The X7 had an issue where it couldn't run my mod, but that might as well also be an issue in my mod and not of the X7. So that is something I need to fix, but it's not an issue with the Everdrive. I love how everyone is getting worked up about the new German conditions clause. They've literally been doing that for three years. Interesting. You're lucky they didn't do the uranium thing on the 3DS, because you would be dead. Well, personally, and this comes from me being a human being that thought about it and also from me talking to an embedded engineer. It sounds like FPGAs are kind of, they're like cool research projects and they're like cool novelty, but as a consumer product, I think they are a hundred percent worthless. Just set up an emulator. You get Chernobyl Syndrome by Nintendo if you modify your Switch 2. Yeah, if you survive. HDR. I don't know what HDR means, but I know what the N64 people called HDR and we already use stuff like that. And if the normals will buy the Switch 2, they then buy the Wii U. Yeah, I don't know. That's too bad, man. All those like craters Nintendo leaves behind all over Europe and America because people modding the 3DS. I don't know. I feel like we should retaliate. HDR means high dynamic range. So basically it's going to have a higher range and are dynamic. Okay, also like in a brightly lit scene, things like, okay, I see, I think. More colors outside the default RGBA standard? That sounds like nonsense. How are you ever going to have more than like... 32,768 to the power of three colors. That doesn't make sense to me. When did Switch 2 graphic update is on par with the GTX 1050? I'm not sure. Bro, is there no fence texture here that I don't fucking despise? What is going on? I'm just going to use this one. Ugh, it's too high res. Little trophy building. Basically, a few empty shelves that got populated with trophies to prevent achievement. Two birds going to the thing in the main game. Beat the first boss in under two seconds. Fence and ease text. We can assume in this stage, I think, from the zooping in level and allow more flexibility. We can build special way to get a star. For example, we can add a little trophy front. Also boosts player retention. And that would be like... There would be no star in there. Aren't we a little worried that players will think this has to do something? That's my worry, hearing you talk about that. It's also my first instinct to think a person making the game to be like, okay, what does the player get for filling this? But it sounds explicitly like something you would not want to fill. When NPC telling you there's no star at all. Okay. Yeah, actually, that does kind of solve the issue. Yeah, I'm kind of on board with that biomech. Thank you for your Blackbeard BL-7000. This phone seems like no other phone. I will make sure to use code CASE to purchase the device when the time comes to replace my smartphone. Will you actually? I am under no obligation to endorse anything I sponsor. In fact, all they wanted was a genuine review. I could have said this phone is dogshit. It fucking sucks. But I genuinely like the phone. Just for the record. Like, I actually think it's a decent phone. Okay, I will add your idea to it, biomech. But not 100% guarantee that there will be anything here. Trophy building is a bunch of small trophies you unlock for doing easter egg stuff or other secrets. Wait, what if... Biomech, I have an idea. Let's say you go into the trophy room and all the trophies are like empty except for the ones you collected. They are all lined up in a two-story building. The trophies are empty except for the ones you collected. And around the trophy you collected, there is a blacked out trophy. And if you read it, it tells you a hint for how to get the trophy. But you have to actually do the thing to get the trophy fully. So it's like Super Smash Bros. Brawl Milestones. And you can try to do all the secret things. Do you read the uncollected trophies to know how to get them? I think we should just make the next two readable. Because otherwise it's too much reading. And also it's more fun that way. Because you have to keep coming back in a way, I guess. Yeah, exactly. So you collect one trophy and you get two hints for the next two trophies. Monsters vs. Plants, that's cool. Well, it's not 100% planned. It's just a random idea Biomech had that we're probably gonna do. Because random ideas like that... I have a way of just... we just make them. Yeah, definitely wouldn't count at 100%. Do you think the phone was a ruse to set you up for modifying the game? Yes. Well, there wouldn't be a point in telling you a percentage if you can just count the amount of empty trophies. And I also really wouldn't want to encourage players to get all of them, it would just be like a for-fun thing for the people that do want to do it. Oh look at this man, this looks so smooth. Wee. Speaking of wee, I started getting like French cat memes on my Instagram algorithm. You guys got those too? I don't understand them, but they're fucking great. You know, it's a lot nicer to like scroll through Instagram and it's like a cat going to like see the 15th Nazi wheel in a row. What's your take on unity? Uh, poopy. You're talking about tralalero tralala type shit? No, it's just cats speaking French to me. Maybe they're doing something similar to what I did to Hezbollah? What you did? Hello Citra. I don't know how you'd insert this, I've got a terrible website. I don't know how you'd insert this, I've got a terrible website. There is a Twitch player without ads by the way and I use it. But it does kind of fuck the rest of the websites, so like you can't look at channel descriptions anymore. It's called opening an alternative player for Twitch. I was not using Twitch at all anymore until I found that extension. I don't know, seeing what's going on in Instagram just makes me think like, like why? Why did they design the algorithm to do this? They have to be planning something, right? They're not turning people into Nazis for no reason. But I don't know what that thing is. Because it sounds insane, but that could be it, man. Maybe it's like, yeah, Nazis spend more time online, so let's turn people into Nazis to get them to spend more time on the app. Maybe that makes sense, because like you can't really be a Nazi in real life very well without a lot of backlash. So maybe they all just like slowly become more and more online and that's like the goal here. It's just so popular. You think that's it? I don't know. I feel like algorithms like that typically don't make a lot of money of just having users on there. They make the real money of like paid for propaganda. So I think someone is on purpose doing this, but I don't know who. I don't really follow the news that much. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe a PvP server? How do the special relishes look during gameplay? Also, maybe a benches like that would look nice in variety brushwoods. They are fairly expensive, so I don't think we want that in variety brushwoods. You only get your cat, fanboy and brain rot posts when you're helping? Fair enough. Simple man has simple needs. Let's check these britches out in game. Where are my britches at? I've gone red at Atheist with the new Pope. Why? What's wrong with the Pope? Taking back your agnostic beliefs to come to your senses once more. I have beef with agnostics. With people that call themselves agnostics. I believe like 99% of people that call themselves agnostic are actually just atheists. They just call themselves agnostics because they're like, Well, but technically there's no proof God doesn't exist. But like, okay, you're not living like that may be true. Now agnostic is just like Atheist, but with even more red and actually spice on top, if anything. Okay, I think the britches are very nice. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Lila. That was a rendering bug here. Even though I am on your new FOSS64. Did we all see that? Let's try write all, see if that works. Agnostics have never heard of Pascal. Pascal's wage is stupid. Think about this. What if I claimed that there was like another God that would also send you to hell if you don't believe in him. And he will send you to heaven forever if you donate 100 bucks right now. Pascal's wager, the same logic you could use to be like, Oh, come on, I guess I have to donate $100 now. Oh, I guess write all fixes it. So it's only broken if write all is not fixed, or not on. We need controversial topics, bingo card for the stream, true. Did the Lighthouse color get fixed? I don't know, let's take a look. There was a black background below this. Below all decals. Hey, this is fixed still. But what's not fixed is the Lighthouse. It's yellow, but it shouldn't be. I have a bug report for this. Also, yes, my write all is off. All my decals have a black background. From a time when the existence of the Lighthouse was unquestioned, opposition to its foundation is a modern phenomenon. Uh-huh. Well, that doesn't change it being stupid in 2025. I don't think the game can drop below 30. Actually, the game can probably drop below 30 somewhere. That would suck. Pascal Smugging? That's a great name. Can you confirm that I sold out Bleat? Nope. I will not. I got stuff to do right now. Wait, that was just a character that actually just did Pascal Smugging a job for every religion in a TV show? That is kind of hilarious, if true. Is it like a joke show or is it supposed to be serious? Because it sounds like a joke. Is this true? I have actually read the bible. Or huge parts of it. Brendan Fraser? Yeah, never watched it. I think you could talk about almost any movie and my response would be, yeah, never watched it. But I've played The Binding of Isaac, basically the same thing. You read the bible, which is true. That is a very good question. Okay, guys, but no, no, please don't just trash talk someone else's religion. We don't want that here. We don't need all the people to gang up on one group of people. That's a little nasty. If there was at least a couple people pushing back, I'd be fine with you guys talking like this. But this is like trash talking someone while they're not in the room. That's nasty. Is gun violence or is politics a brand new stream topic? I don't know. That's true. This is something good we have to say about every religion. There is a reason that every major society is or used to be very religious, I think. And that is because there is almost an evolution-like effect where culture is passed down to your children. And this leads to the culture that creates a more stable society to be the one that makes it to the modern age. So by virtue of the religion having survived for so long, I believe we can conclude that believing in it leads to a more stable society. Let's see. Do you see my idea? The eruption of a volcano being caused by sneezing black living there? Nope. Someone cancels that? True. Something which is better than most people give it credit for. I have yet to play that one. That's the one where he turns into a werewolf. Pope case to 64. How many popes do we have right now? Actually no, wouldn't that mean that there were 63 pope cases before me? It's gonna be a while before then, man. What would be your pope name? What would be your pope name? Sans Undertale. Someone introduced the best in the game? True! Stangelicious Masterpiece and its flaws are only likely to affect impatient players if you accept the game what it is. It's an unrivaled experience. Okay, I have maybe to play it once. I wanna play Sonic 06 once they release the fixed port of it. Of course Mario 64 is the 64th Mario game. What kind of question is that? Why do you think it's called Mario 64? Why do you think it's called Mario 64? I don't know. Oh yeah, that's actually 64. Are you aware of the whole dinosaur planet thing? I have heard about dinosaur planets, but I have not really looked into it because I wasn't that interested in it. I think Star Fox Adventure kind of sucks. I'm sorry guys, but the first level is fucking cryptic and then you get put into a fucking maze. Nope, I'm out. Rodeo Classic already has all the levels in it and only has one more up than adding hard ones and bosses. I think it's the best game to have any Sonic game, optional or otherwise. Well, once it's done, I might play it. But please keep in mind that I hate Sonic games. So, you saying it has the best Sonic gameplay kind of makes me want to not play it. I only like Sonic Adventure 1, Sonic Adventure 2 and a little bit of Sonic Heroes. Sonic Heroes would be great if it wasn't so fucking buggy. You have a 274 streak in Schizoscrap? That is crazy. The idea I had was that a sneezing block would cause the eruption and the Yoshi and Wario friend would think, oh the volcano got us angry at us. You're giving it too much story is the problem. It was just going to be a thing that happens. You're like trying to make explanations for it and stuff and there's just, that's just too much. You don't want to interrupt the player to tell them a lore that they might not care about, right? Just because you as the game designer cares about the lore, doesn't mean that the player is going to care. I mean, it'd be nice of him to care, but you know, not the reality we live in. I've been saying it's cringely that Avengers are discriminated by the atheists are criminally underrepresented in prisons. It's also a moral test. Ha, that's a weird conclusion. So it's really amazing that the Falcon Dinosaur looks so good in a virtual world game and gives off an almost volumetric look. That sounds like a very expensive technique. Or is it still too hard? Okay, wait. Oh my god. There is so much text. I'm sorry. I can't read all of that. Well, it wasn't finished. So obviously it would be buggy. You can't look at an unfinished game and be like, wow, this is so buggy. Glad it's not finished. Like, come on, come on, man. That's just unfair. Okay. Whatever. This is good for now. I added so much text to Course 4. In Course 4, there's like a lot of stupid little things you can do that should affect text and I added text for everything. But like, you want to know the most fucked up thing about the beta test for Course 4 that happened? So in that one area where you sneak past the guards, the player did not see that there was glass blocking it. So they just ran into the glass and died. I'm not sure if that's something we should fix or if it's like, well, it's kind of a skill issue. These are decisions you have to make as a game designer. What's the textbox storage situation? Oh, there is no shortage of storage. Textboxes are pretty small. So, fun fact, we have 480 dialogs in this game right now, which is around three times what vanilla Mario 64 had, which kind of implies we have three times the content. Since this is your favorite Sonic game, what do you think of Mad Space? Personally, I hate it. I like it. Just three times the yapping. Now it's actually much more content. Defeat connoisseur. In the phone earlier, I saw that you forgot to cut your toenails. Watch out for toe infections. They can get pretty nasty, especially in the weightlifting community. Interesting. I did actually cut my toenails recently. So, I guess I get that I'm not at all. Let me take a look at this area. I think most Sonic games are good, just flawed. I think most Sonic games, game design wise, are just fundamentally terrible. The first Sonic game is good in 1980. Back then, you had one game and you had to play it for five months. That made sense, that it was so memorization-based. But then they do that again in a modern game, where you do make progress and where you're not expected to play the same stage a hundred times, and you just fucking run into walls over and over, and it's like, why? This game design does not work. That's how I felt about it. And the boost games, it's all just like, quick time events to me. I don't know what two seconds is. Anyway, so, we have to make something good for the trees. And this is gonna be difficult. Oh yeah, the Sonic music is 10 out of 10 for sure. Okay, the question is, how can we make the trees work? The easiest thing would probably be to have a backdrop of trees that is like a 2D plane with some 3D ones in front. Well, Spectacle is pretty much lost on me, game design-wise, so that just wouldn't work. Funny how they usually say that you like running into walls and you like just glorified quick time events. Well, I guess I can see people liking the quick time events. I can absolutely see how that would be fun. Right, there's people liking rhythm games. A lot of Sonic games are very similar to rhythm games, but instead of just having a button come down, you have a 3D landscape come at you, and there's a visual representation of what your buttons do, other than it's hard playing. So in that sense, yeah, they're just good rhythm games. Um, room system doesn't mean anything to me. I am the size of Dolphin, so we can explore faster. That's what we're thinking about right now, Shadowboy. What? I'm talking to chat too much. Right now, we are trying to make the whole game look good. So, or well, just the level look good. That works by taking all the flat geometry involved and adding shaders and visuals to it. So we're in this area right now. If you look at the next area, it's all just going to be flat garbage like this. It's not going to look like anything. So right now, we're still working in this area, and the last thing remaining in this area is the trees. So I definitely need to do something with that mountain to look less poopy. I don't like how it cuts off. And then the trees. This one is kind of a banger in how it does the forest. Are you going to add clouds? Maybe. Not my concern right now. Well, the water is just a flat plane with no texture. Of course, it's only there. Ah, we're working on it. But now we're doing the trees. Please, the only allowed topic right now is trees. Yeah, so you see how this is a flat plane in the background with some 3D trees in the foreground? I think we can pull off something like that. See how this is all actually flat? The problem is that they eventually end, so... Move layers of 2D trees that are comparatively smaller towards the back to simulate a distance. That's a hella overdraw. Oh, it's a 3D model. What do you think? Can we do parallax in 3D? There we go. Let's see what a mangrove is. Hmm, wait. Oh my god! Oh my god! Okay, well. This is maybe not the right decision. Can it slap a couple bubbly trees down and call it a day? Hmm. Bubblegloops spawn? Yeah, I think that's gonna be a mix too. Are there trees in Bubblegloops spawn? I don't remember that. I don't remember seeing any. And I only looked at the 3D model, so... Yeah, it's just walls. It's just walls. Send some 3D trees and darker shades of the 2D tree walls so it can blend well together. Yes, I'm thinking too that there's just going to be a background of 3D trees that you can't get to. A background of 2D walls of trees. Just like drawn on trees. And then in front of it there's gonna be some 3D trees. Oh, is the other one click-clack? What? I don't see anything here. Hmm.  The blood of Lain with 3D trunks? I was imagining half 3D trunks and plain brush. I'm not sure what you mean by plain brush. Let's first look at the textures we have here, because we have a few... Wait, forest tiles? Oh god, the gates of hell have opened. Someone's using the heat upstairs. Canopy, canopy, what's that again? Oh, like the tree crown? Hmm. Yeah, we could definitely have just like the front face of a tree. Just like six triangles, like chook, chook, chook. And then a tree crown that's just like two triangles, or maybe even three triangles. That is the cheapest option for sure. But is it gonna look good? Do we just have a ton of those with like a 3D tree background behind it? I think that could work. We had something like this in I think the Vine Dino domain. Let's look at the Vine Dino domain. Hmm. Oh, call site, the lion. Biobak, gathering fucking anxiety, seeing this level in its old state. Get me out of here! I've played these games before! Hmm. Hmm. Oh, I see, because some of them are transparent. We have a line of altering tree model half-trees, but they're in branch models, so you can place them occasionally. Those are like micro-details we can go play with. For now, we just need like a decent base. Hmm. So this is 2,900 in height. Hmm. Ah! Hmm. Yeah, I definitely need to edit the texture somewhat. What if a line of altering... Oh, wait. So I'm thinking we're gonna have a tree background like this, with normal trees in front. And that should hopefully look good. It will be a little bit expensive, but that's fine. Oh, I didn't. Sorry. No. Okay, thank you. That's the noise I make when follow active quad is not working as I want it to. If not, I should not do a Raspberry Pi. Why would I really have this rust? What the fuck? You want to know a secret about programming languages? The only people that care about which programming language you use are people that are not very good at programming. This is the dirty secret they don't want you to know. I can read on optimizing the engine or still some areas have to improve. All the big stuff is done. There's just some like small things like the operating system that I still want to do. You sounded like a little kid after drinking a glass of water. I do kind of try to like invoke my inner child after breaking his iPad when I get upset at Blender. Did you used to learn game developing when you first started? No, I just started doing it. Probably should have used some sources to start learning about anything before I did stuff, but I did not. Okay, I think there's not so much. I think it's a lot better as a base layer. And then we can still improve it. So the next step would be to add 3D models in front of it. And I'm going to try that in a second. Rusty Yoshi's Island. Can I run into the second one? Yeah, he asked me if I'm up for second one, so I agreed to it. I'm surprised how many people watched it. Okay, let's have a large enough area so that we have a base that looks good like a volcano. Yeah, oops. I fucked up. Okay. Wait, there's overhead to rust? Okay, if your programming language has any overhead at all, it's already garbage. You're basically saying the programmer doesn't have full control over the system. Let's see, what's your pitch? 364 likes. Wait, who did... Where is this on? That has to be like... Mark Kirko? Is that on Mark Kirko's channel? Where is this? Who would receive such a comment? Mario Nova. Oh. You know what, that actually makes sense, what the content Mario Nova is making. Nope, I won't set a bar. Okay. I kind of want to make this go more into jungle. You know what, let's just first make a tree, see what happens. I don't even know what that means. I have no idea what you're talking about. It's all schizophrenic to me. I don't think windy is really what I'm going for here. I want this to mostly feel like a summer island. I don't know, retro gaming is awesome. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What the hell? It looks like a fun show. Yes, they will not be able to collect those walls. They will. Okay, so my plan is that there's actually just going to be a large invisible wall in front of the actual 3D model forest. And you cannot walk kick off it. Okay, and it's just a landscape of my own project. I've been using my Nestle, but notice you have a very different workflows. They don't just bring us plugins. Those are plugins to be viable for modeling. Yes, you can use these. You even see the actual shaders they create. You will almost get a one-to-one visual output of the N64 if you use FOSS64. Oh, this looks very tree-barky. I kind of like this texture here. This is a sick texture. Yep, it's FOSS64. I guess it creates fast 3D displacements, which is what the N64 uses. What if one of those mid-completion cycles of the living world of Yrsa Alland is a tropical storm and NPCs are complaining about it? To be able to support the entire island looking windy, we will need to be able to make all these vertices here movable. And it is going to be a huge issue to do that, I think. Oh, isn't there a book about that too? What was that book called? It was not called Castaway, right? I don't mean the Wilson-Wilson one, I mean the other one. I don't know if you have to be an Eevee runner to see it, but FOSS64 definitely shows you where it goes. I'm pretty sure FOSS64 also has its own work-in-progress renderer. Not a footpress, no. It's just one guy getting stranded and surviving on an island. Actually, that book has to be really old. God, I haven't had McDonald's in like 5 years. Is it good? Is McDonald's any good? I've heard it got worse. Well, how you tile your textures is entirely up to you. You don't have to project textures. That's Lost, 2004. Yeah? Robinson Crusoe, yes, that sounds right. I think that's what I read. Oh no, this is the song where that one guy on the guitar in your left ear just will not shut up. I can't listen to this. I have to skip this song. I'm going to have lost what place you're working on with the trees? Nope. Entirely unfounded assumption. So I assume I'm going to have a good spend of the election in Poland. It might be super popular, though. Yeah, this is how trees look like. Yeah, it looks good to me. I feel like I remember that. I feel like you've shown that to me before. Oh. Hmm. Yeah, I'm not very convinced on this tree here. I'm going to get your hutch. What the fuck is a hutch? Is this tree going to be bombarded? No. You're just going to be unable to go behind it. At least that's the plan. Right now we're still experimenting with how to make the forest here look not completely flat. And I was thinking maybe an army of 3D trees like this would work. Yeah, it looks kind of terrible to me. We probably also want some lower plants here. Well, there is the forest in Madras Mosque in Drusene, which looks pretty good, I think. So I don't think that it has to look terrible. I believe that there is a solution to the problem. We just have to find it. I don't know. I suppose I was relying on very specific extents, that was a cutscene only, right? Yeah, it is a cutscene. That makes it a lot easier because you control the camera angle. Why not do trees like how Portal 1 did? Even then I didn't think that would go very well. I don't remember any Portal 1 trees. Why don't we try to build water trees between the 3D trees also? No, build water trees are going to clip into everything. That would look pretty terrible. I think this idea has potential. Yeah, exactly. There is a flat wall behind it and then a lot of 3D trees in front of it and that kind of works. Maybe just adjust the chunks a bit to make it blend well with the background? Yeah, that would be for later though. First I need to actually feel like this can work before I try to make small adjustments like that. Because why would we spend all the effort on making all the trees look unique before we don't have confirmation that this can look good? Okay, well, these trees are funky. I want a bush. While there is a lazy way out and that is to just add like a sphere and that's your entire leaf thing. There is some Mario 64 guess to do that and I don't like it. I hate it. Here another row of 2D trees behind the front of this one would be good. Second row of trees being a little higher to make it more three-dimensional. I see what you mean. Definitely has potential. There is also this texture here which is what Madross Mask uses. Vengacusa could work. Remember that. Ah, the arrow assets are just way nicer. Um... I definitely want it darker at the bottom. And then this needs to be multiplied by a value here. 0.75 And then one minus texture zero. I think something like this has potential. Madross, can I have more grey dot? Yes, of course. But that's all for later. We need to get like a base of the visuals first. Oops. So I am in agreement with the idea of scaling all of these down here a little bit. And then let's say we do this. And then the second layer here. Let me move it back a little bit. Actually it should be the upper two layers here. That's too much. There we go. Let me remove this one here. Okay, that looks a little foresty. I think we made a little bit of a forest. Monoprotections is not working. Is that the dojo in the background where the Shy Guys will play hide and seek with the player? No. I don't remember hide and seek in the overworld. But that dojo is something else. But I forgot exactly what it was. Okay, it looks a little bit like a forest, yeah? I don't 100% completely hate this. Can you make the billboard? Why would I want to do that? Why do I want a billboard tree? They're gonna look like shit. I think the biggest issue here is that the foreground trees look so different from the background trees. That's what makes this not work. It's the fact that the tree colors are so different. Let me look at this forest again. Yeah, I think if I apply vertex color to the main trees, it's gonna look a lot more reasonable. People love talking about billboards. Look at that forest, man. That's a nice forest. This used to have a forest all around. You guys want to hear something cool? Listen very closely. What do you hear? What are you hearing right now? I added that recently. With the sound composer I made, Badoop is able to make sound effects. I like the bridge in the middle here. I think it adds so much. It makes the environment instantly feel like two times as alive. Yeah, the rotors. Now you can hear them again. I love them. Yeah, the coins are not going to be flying at you in the end, I'm pretty sure. It seems to me, a mechanic, that everyone seeing it universally thinks it's gonna suck. I just needed to test it in-game. So far, none of the testers had issues with it. Maybe I don't need to remove it. We'll see. Okay. I don't think the final players are even going to notice it. Because they never heard the previous version. YouTube does have a long delay, unfortunately. Hmm. Let's look at it one more time. Who me, DMing me? Oh, Kyle just started on the next video, called Why was the N64 so blurry? I hate Tongo. I don't want to listen to Tongo. Tongo is bad. Unless you literally pay to play Tongo. So, I have heard complaints about triple overdraw fuckery in chat. Which is why we are going to boot up the N64 real quick. Low output resolution next video? Nah, that's not all. Yo, can we blame Lila for this? Okay. We're gonna blame Lila for this. Yeah, whenever you get an RDP trash, you will need to completely unplug the summer card. Put it back in. Do this. And then it works. Is there any way to fix the Leica's bug or not? Yes, the way to fix it is to go into Lila's DMs and ask her can you please fix the yellow lighters bug. And if you do it often enough, she might fix it. We have 32 FPS here, with the fucked up water bug. I think we're fine. 50? Come on. We can check the triple overdraw fuckery. And honestly, on N64 this looks even more like a real forest. Kinda like it. Ow! Haha. Man, that line looks really bad. We definitely need to fix that. Yeah, that's pretty much it. That's something similar to that. Ooh, why do the leaves look like that? Oh, the leaves are not good. We need to do something for the leaves. We need a different texture here, I think. What is actually going to be? I don't know. Ah! Stop! I will bite. Okay, so if you make a transition area inside the lighthouse, the first now lances of lighthouse are quite beautiful pieces of geometry. Yeah? I'm not sure what you mean exactly. Do you mean like the lens that look at the top? Yeah. That's definitely going to exist. Yeah. Is this texture saveable? What if we do threshold? Would that work? I mean, the release itself wasn't a very wrong ride. Let's try threshold. I'm sure we'll figure it out when we get there, Alan, we're definitely going to put some kind of title on some items. It allows texture to obscure the preceding layers. I'm not really a react content creator. I don't have many reactions on me. Oh, that didn't work at all. So, on Saturday, on Sunday, I finally got done with all my tasks, and I felt like making a neuroevolution Mario 64 machine learning thing. And I kind of did that in Mario 64, so now I have like a thing that can train an AI inside Mario 64 to play Mario 64, and I think it can be really cool at some point. I know I already did something similar to that a long time ago, but it sucked, so this one's better, I think. So, it looks fine from afar. And from up front, I think it's passable. I think this passes as like a forest. I think I'm okay with this being a forest. I might need a different tree crown texture here, but other than that, I think we're good. I think it's just the top of the tree that I don't like. The treetops can actually be two textures to double the resolution. It would be relatively cheap, and I think it would be worth it. Something like this, maybe? Would that look good? What do you think? Does it look good? I think it has potential. It's not a puzzle from the perspective of someone who isn't making it right now. Hmm. The problem is that I've seen what you guys cheer for, so you cheers mean nothing to me. Sorry, that was a little mean. But you get the idea, right? Is that the same because of all the color mismatch? Color mismatch. So, there's still a color mismatch issue. I get that the front row here is a different color, but I thought that was fine. But maybe it's better if it's not. Should it be blue? Maybe the top could be bluer and then the bottom greener. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hard to say. Very critical is nothing that's more than good. Alright. Well, I know it's still very improvable, so I'm going to improve it. But knowing that people like it is good intel. Hmm. Well, we want something higher resolution that preserves the cartoonish feel, of course. Hmm. Yeah, we didn't align the grass with the floor yet. That's no concern for now. Of course, I know that grass shouldn't be flying. I have been alive for an orbit, and I have not seen flying grass yet. Hmm. This is an interesting texture. Same with this one. Kinda like that one. And this one. And this one. Okay, that one's poopy. Yeah, it has the acorns on it. Eh. I can't believe this is the best one I found. This texture is disgusting. I can't use this. This looks awful. Let's go cry. Okay. I don't know, but I still don't want it. I don't think the colors are very good. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. What the fuck? Okay. I can't select anything. What the fuck was that? No. No, move away. There we go. Okay, this needs 128 by 63. And then we can do this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. 32 by 32s. And 32 by 126s. Okay. There we go. Kind of goated. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I see. I don't know what kind of a ribbon is. A continuous ribbon. I see. Yeah, that could work. Oh. Okay. Not exactly sure how a continuous ribbon would look like, but... That sounds potentially promising. Okay. It looks kind of bad, though, to be honest. What I did here. I wish it looked better.  Okay. Yeah, I don't think this is good. No, it's not the outlines, it's the texture itself that doesn't look good. Stretching the texture more horizontally. Oh. Yeah, I don't think so. Yeah, I don't think the texture is good. We need a different texture. Is this some looping? It might be looping. Yes, it is. Rouge's levels. Fuck it. It's like too shadowy everywhere. Yeah, and it's not very cartoony. I think we need to look at tree canopy textures. Maybe there's something on texture resource. It looks like the thing you'd say was great and who's from what you say sucks. Wait, there's plenty. The ribbon of foliage out front. Well, there needs to be something here so we can limit the gameplay area. No, I think it's the texture itself. We had a better looking texture before, but the texture was very low resolution. Interesting concept. Yes. It's going to be close. Do be what she says. This one looks potentially promising. What the fuck? Man, tree modeling is like an art. Maybe Zayna still has HD versions of her textures, then we could use those, because the one we used earlier, this one here, is an HD type, it's a texture Zayna made, and I think she draws them in 640x640. What if this one works? I can honestly see potential. Um, it should be more tropical than this, what's that? Shedding its leaves annually? Yeah, definitely tropically. Something that looks pretty random. That's fine. It just clashes a lot with the tree behind it. Well, it is higher resolution than it will actually be in-game, so. Let's actually get this to the correct scale. Yay! There should be like a law mandating that every program, more like editing, makes it so that when you hover the menu in the options, in the HUD, it automatically tells you the But I don't. Yeah, I think this looks fine. This engine actually matches basically all modern engines too. Not sure what you mean by triangulate. It does render triangles, if that's what you're asking. But the definition of triangle is, uh, it's weird. There is hexagons that are triangles. Yeah, I think the foliage model is necessary for gameplay reasons. Hello, Mario Luigi SM64. Okay, you definitely need to get rid of the fuzziness and the blank outline. But once that's taken care of, I think this works. Ugh, but the fuzziness is so bad. Holy shit. Wow, that is bad. What does this do? Yeah, why is there so much dithering and fuzziness going on? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  There's an unusually remnant of grass alternating between each tree. That's not as bad as this. No, I think it needs to be in front for the wall. Yeah, what's with all these holes? You see that? No hole, hole. No hole, hole. No hole, hole. Bullshit. Let's try this on Photoshop. Now I'm using Photoshop. That looks a million times better right away. Okay. And this one we need to do in camp. Because stupid stuff. So this is already indexed to 16 colors. Alright, well this is a good reference for my future self. What the fuck is going on? I can't select anything.  I fucking hate this program. Wait, this is not the scanned version. Oh, shit. Using a program you don't understand is so frustrating. Okay, that's what I thought. This is what I thought Photoshop would produce. I can't select anything. I need to select everything first before I can select anything at all. And then I need to invert the selection. It's so stupid that you can't do this part in Photoshop. Why did Photoshop decide that whenever you save an image, it just overwrites the other one? There's the alpha layer. Also, I just killed the other one. Great. Fucking great. This Sonic song does absolutely not describe how I feel right now. Oh my god, that looks like so much better. I'm never indexing colors in GIMP again. Wow. If you want to select all pixels on a layer, you can right-click layer with a leaf and then resolve just to do that. Nope. No, you're wrong. I couldn't select anything. I just select everything first. Somehow it was in negative selection mode or something. That would only let me unselect things. No, Photoshop shouldn't just add that automatically. Photoshop should just make it so that it doesn't overwrite the alpha layer with full black. Because the fact that it overwrites the alpha layer with full black means that I can't use texture filtering. Which would ruin the visuals of my video game. Anyway, this is better. Way better. There we go. All right. I'm done for now. I love that none of the three layers are the same alternatively. Yes, that's an issue. We definitely need to do something for the background. I don't like that it's the same 3D map. And also this one in the background doesn't exist. So there really is just two types of tree. But yes, it sucks. It's not good. Anyway, I'll see you guys next stream. Bye.
