Hello, Yoy. Hello, Mimosky. Oh, my tum-tum hurts today. Hello, Selton. Wrong audio output. Oh, my gosh. This is kind of beautiful, to be honest. I think today is finally the day we move on to the second area. Nice ROG. I wish I got paid to watch a game stream. I kind of want lava coming down that thing. I think it would look very cool if you had a combiner with lava veins at the top. It's kind of weird how one side of this is completely black and the other one isn't, right? Something about this feels wrong. That's way better. Anyhow, it's the first day. The lighthouse is supposed to look neat, too, but there's a Frost64 bug that makes it so I can't make it look neat. I know, it sucks. I think Ride All might fix it, but I really don't want to check because of other issues. I don't know if this is well-read, but it appears that you're streaming. Okay. Hello, JM. Let's see what we can do with the volcano. We also need something. Well, actually, we had someone point out that these mountains don't look very good, and I think that's fair enough. We can maybe try a different texture. Something about this pattern seems wrong, and I think it's because of this texture here. Okay. You're a cool creator. I'm glad you like it. Hello, Verze. I wonder if something like this would be better. Let's try it. Wait.  Oh, this is a CI16 already. CI4. Oh, that sucks that I have the CI4 version of it. I wish I had the high-res version of it. I kind of need the high-res version of it. Hello, Liliana. Maybe we can find the high-res version of it and then properly make it grayscale. I think I found the high-res version of it. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Do you guys like this a little better than the other one? I think it looks more like a real mountain this way. So I do kind of like it. Hello, dashboard. Okay. I'm thinking maybe this whole thing should be higher. But also I can just do that. And that's kind of practical. Like, this is a possibility. Any OST wishes, guys? Guys, we need to listen to something. I need someone to give me a music list. Or we're going to be sitting here in awkward silence, which, by the way, is perfectly fine with me. I used to not listen to music at all and just work in silence. Like a fucking psychopath. Diddy Kong Racing?  Oh, no. Diddy Kong Racing has the band messes up OST at the end. And I hate it. I hope we don't get that. I learned recently that the Diddy Kong Racing OST was not made by Grant Kirkhope. And ever since knowing that, I'm a little bit of a Grant Kirkhope hater. Most overrated music artist. This is an interesting texture. Let's try it out. Yeah, it's crazy. Grant Kirkhope gets all the credits when David Weiss did this song, this whole OST. Dude, how is that even possible? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Something like this was my idea. I had a brain far. Brain far. Dude, are you guys ready for the agnostic rant? Oh, my God. I have such a good agnostic rant. Just assume it's another Grant Kirkhope or any other minigame composer. I mean, I already said I'm kind of a Grant Kirkhope hater now. I know this one wasn't made by him. There's a few tracks by someone else and the S version is utterly broken. It must have fucked up the MIDI playback.  Would not be too surprising, would it? What do you think of my volcano idea? Wait, this needs to be take zero. Hello, fear of darkness. I am doing well. So this makes it appear where otherwise it would be black. So this is not really what I want. I think this way around makes more sense. This sounds like Mario Kart Wii to me somehow. I think the idea works, but it's not great. Please tell me that we'll get around to something during the game's progression. That would be cool. There should be an event. Yeah, I'm going to note this down. What would happen though? What would happen? How is this going to turn into a star? The volcano randomly erupting is really cool. Yeah. And someone creating a path, maybe. Hmm. Yeah, it looks wrong right now, but I think the idea is good. I will have to be using different textures, but I think the idea for the combiner works very well. Yeah, but let's think about what the volcano would do, because I think that's a very good idea. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I want to have a column of smoke prior to erupting to denote that it's a volcano. A column with the heart since wind would cause it to bend. Now we can definitely have some stuff come out of there. That's not the issue. I'm thinking more about the gameplay that we would have with this. Do I have to pick a specific part of the map to open a secret stage? Yes. Oh, I'm going to strike the earth, not to invoke Dwarf Fortress. Don't get the references here. But yeah. So there is this area here where you generally go into the volcano and then beat the rising lava. So the volcano erupting event should definitely come after that. I'm thinking the volcano erupting event happens after you beat this stage and got a star in Grand Sand Badland. So this will happen when you're already very familiar with the area. I guess if we had the lava go here, then there would be a whole lava stream going down here. Unless we made it go up like we already did. The consequence of it could be that this whole area here is flooded with lava. Something like this. And maybe that does something. I don't know. In the passage while we don't have... Have really any more secret levels, so I am not 100% sold on that. The volcano could also erupt here and fill this with lava. Maybe there would be a huge rock formation afterwards. Is this gonna be permanent change? Yes! The island goes through permanent change as you're on it. So there could be a whole island here made out of something. We could do something very simple and have there be a bully here. And then it's just a bully boss fight. And you have to send the bully to water. Sorry, someone is gonna come by today and drop off some aquarium plants, so I have Facebook open, so you might hear that. I like the idea of turning the presser when you visit it. Me too! Bully boss fight is cool, but why does he die when you throw him in water? Maybe he can't swim. Maybe it's something simpler. It doesn't have to be a bully, it could just be someone that lived in a volcano during the stage. Let's try that out. Volcano erupts and lava enters the first area. This creates a big stone platform. A guy on it. The guy on the platform was previously an enemy in the lava rising site level and is now an NPC. Maybe something like that. I think it would be very cool if you first had to beat the boss fight in the rising lava level and then afterwards this boss fight came back in the first area. That would be so cool. Imagine you beat the guy and then the lava erupts and the guy is just there on the island. I don't know if you want him to die to water. Honestly, if he is a boss fight first, I don't want to kill him again. Unless the guy is like a real asshole. I hope you are taking the uppercut to spring or what? As far as we want. Yo, thank you for the subscription retard and thank you for the free 5 pounds to give to Kaze. I appreciate the 5 pounds. He is some sort of lava guy and when he starts on the volcano here and then becomes stone changing his fight. Now, I like the idea of it just being a bully from R64. Just imagine a normal bully boss fight at the end of the rising lava level, which is fine because the rising lava is already cool as fuck. I think the bully is fine. We could even have a special boss fight where... I don't know. But we can make a special bully boss fight. Now there is a large area in place used for alienation identification. Cool. And then after you beat him, maybe he becomes a normal NPC. He is like, man, you beating me really was a wake up call. God, that looks terrible. I bought this shirt for my birthday. The black version. You can't see the smoke of the Vroom Vroom Rambos. Dang, that sucks. I guess black is not the best color for that one. What would this guy do in the overworld once he's chilled out a little bit? Chilling out? Chill bully? Is there a connection here? He could just be a punching bag for fun. Hmm. Nah. I told you that I was making a run mic. Cool, you're making a run mic. That's good. These already look a lot better. And this one too. What if in the overworld he became less black and had more of a blue tone? And he had one of those floaty swimming rings. And he said, I'm done being a bully. I'm being a chill bully now. Nah, that still sounds like bully. Maybe there's a bully who likes that? Like a masochist? No. He would be a boss fighter and then an NPC. Should have a top hat covering his spike and plank, but he's good now. That's funny. One second, I saw one of those spikes. Maybe I had the wrong idea. I don't get it. Yeah, him wearing something. He could just have put a cork on his things. I think that's the funny idea. He just has a cork on his horns and he's wearing a floaty. And he's like, yeah, I'm one of the good guys now. Hopefully he helps you break that rock. Hmm. Hmm. He wouldn't be a lifeguard. He'd just be like a tourist on Yoshi's Island. You could make a joke about how his floaty ring is not enough for a metal body or something. Both Abdullah. Okay. Put a bully in it. Boss fight. He has corks blocking his horns and he's wearing a floaty ring. But he still can't swim because he's made of metal. He says he's chilled out and wants to make an honest living now. I think that works. Hello, Biobak. We are just now planning a banger idea. Maybe you have ideas too. So I was working on the volcano. Someone said the volcano should erupt. And I said, that's a great idea. And then the idea is you first beat the secret level with the rising volcano. And then on top of that, there is a boss fight. I'm thinking just a normal bully boss fight. Just the standard Mario 64 bully boss fight. You don't think much about it. Kick him in the lava. You get a star. It's fine. I don't think it's too disappointing at the end of a rising lava level. All good. But then at some star count, the volcano erupts. And you see a cut scene of like the first level being here. You see the volcano erupt some lava that goes down here. The lava forms a big stone platform here. And on the stone platform, there's a bully. And this bully was previously in the boss fight in here. But he has corks on top of his horns. And he's wearing a floaty swimming ring. And he says he's chilled out. He's done being a bad guy. And then how does he give you a star? That's what we're thinking right now. Hello, Sonic the Hedgehog. Thank you for the subscription. I didn't read the text. I'm very sorry. Is there a cheap way to make dark colors of text to be affected more than the light does? Sure. I'd have to just multiply this by text to show one color. But I don't think that's a good idea. Maybe it is. I like it too. Sorry guys, that's my Facebook marketplace. I'm sorry. I shouldn't really do a video seeing subs from X or something. Sure, maybe. But I think it could be made of ice because it's a bully now. Yeah, I thought that too. We need some kind of twist on the bully fight. Something minor, but vanilla boss fights suck. Yeah, I'm fine with that. Yeah, I'm definitely fine with some boss fight. I definitely want some kind of twist to it. Not too much, just a very slight twist. But yeah. Some compact areas, the Diddy Kong Racing OST. Can really kill him in lava. No, he would sink in the lava. And then when the volcano erupts, he flies out of it again. Another subscription. I can't read that. I'm sorry. But thank you for the sub. I'm getting these plants. You read my suggestion? Nope. What was it? Oh, I see. I'm thinking there should be a lot of really random triggers like that. Where people don't even know why it happened. It just seems like it randomly happens. And the island feels alive. Well, it looked terrible in Lost Impact, but that kind of works. No. I don't want anything too complicated, guys. Just for the fun.  Decision for the boss fight? Shit, I might have missed that too. Sorry, guys. There's so much going on. Oh, him walking in circles. Of course. Yeah, I've read that. I don't think that really matters. I think what matters more is that we have the star in the overworld be fun. I think the actual gameplay of the boss fight. Not something I even want to think about right now. Just the star in the overworld. Unless we want to think of a boss fight that we can then reference in the overworld. Then I'm fine with that. Like, if you have a boss fight idea, that would make sense as an overworld interaction afterwards. Like, maybe he, in the boss fight, shoots some kind of item at you. And then in the overworld he's like, yeah, I'm selling this item to the Yoshis now. You know, using my talents for good. Let's see. Mirror Cataclysm. Mirror Cataclysm. Oh, I see. These guys. Hmm. A wobbly platform would for sure shake up the fight a lot. And then you could be like, oh, my stone platform doesn't wiggle as nice as my old one. Yeah, that makes sense. I'm not entirely sure how this would work, but it's an idea, yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Plungello. He's in water, there should be bubbles all around him. Like, the water is boiling. I was thinking that he has a floaty, but he still can't go in water, because he's too heavy, because he's made out of metal. Hmm.  Are there any other bully boss fights where they maybe do something? He could be just, you know, helping clean up the island. I don't know. Hmm. You could say that the reason his horns are covered is to not pop his floaty. That could be, I mean, that's a fun explanation. I'm just worried that his text box is growing too big right now. We don't want him to be a Yappa, you know. We don't want him to be a standard comedian. We want him to be a part of the world. You can have a giant enemy like baby bosses fighting for him in the background, and you shoot cannons at him. What? What's that got to do with anything? A bully boss fight with Watermark at the end? Let's see that. Watermark at the end of the bully fight. Gosh. He looks so much better than the Mario 64 one. Holy shit. Oh, I see. Hmm. CML? Hmm. What does Bro do? What if when you defeat him, you somehow break his Sierra Java volcano, causing it to explode, shooting the bully somewhere on the island, and you have to find him then? I think I prefer the explosion as a random event. It also makes more sense that way with him becoming good, because there's more time than past. He will have character development. Was the Fresnel 3D World bully fight on the Miyazawa level? Let's see. Fresnel 3D World bully. Cool, there's one here. I don't think I'm going to find him. Are we catching the screen check? Of course. Well, we only want to think about the fight if the idea for the fight is going to enhance his overworld appearance right now. That's all I care about. We could just do something stupid like, yeah, we're all good now, I'm going to have my goons clean up the island, you know. It could be something like that. Just be a retort until you push him into the water and he becomes explaining why he's angry all the time. Hmm. That could be it, yeah. Like he's just red hot, he comes here, he sees you, he runs at you, he falls in the water, he cools down. Or maybe he's just red hot and him landing in the water is what makes him good.  Prompts in this game. Bombcat? Cloud cap, wing cap and ice cap. My sunshine dog thing. Oh, the chain chomps. Yeah, it's kind of like that. But then we just have two fights with him, that's lame. Let's trust that he wasn't evil, just trust it when we need him or whatever. Maybe. He wouldn't have a float on the boss fights. No top hat, no. I don't think so. Unless you can somehow make a good argument for a top hat.  yes, the fight being lame is not the point. The point is that it's cool that the world develops and characters appear and the dwarves and the world feels alive. That's the goal here. We don't try to make a good boss fight, we try to make a good overworld right now. No, you don't pop shit, he's in the volcano, he doesn't have a floatie, he's in a volcano. He hates you for no reason. So I don't really see it to be honest. So Yeah, I'm fine with that. Also yeah, it is just a minor boss, that is also true. I mean, I'm fine with a good boss fight if it doesn't take too much scolding basically. We chill bully somewhere and they become friends in the water. If we have another idea for a chill bully, maybe. Lovers? I don't know about that. Although it would be funny. You're in his float when you enter his arena. Why does he have a float in the arena? How do you land there? You go up, not down. He's an asshole to you, why are you buying a boat? No, I don't like this. I just want him to be cooled down. I just want him to be like, I was bad and now I'm good. I'm coming to your neighborhood. Anyway, I think we can settle on him just coming to the overworld. Can we resolve the bully fight? He's assuming you charge towards him and moves out of the way and you've figured out how to counter him. Maybe. I've read that before, Adriano. That's the plan for today. Finish Chachendas in part one. We are basically done with that, just gonna do a volcano and then we got sidetracked with the bully idea. No, the bully has to be begging for forgiveness for his misdeeds. What if the bully, after his escapades, offers demolition services and there's a breakable wall here and you pay him money and he opens it and he's like, I want to make an honest living now, I'm done being a thug, here's my demolition services, I can open walls for you. And you pay him and he opens a wall and then you get a czar. Something like that is what I'm thinking. Yes, part two is next up. Tiki bar, let's see what that is. Another NPC that breaks the wall. Yes, I think it's lame too. I'm just saying like, that is kind of how it should be. A tiki bar is fun, this gives him a lot of personality. This was always my dream actually, I didn't want to be... Okay, I have a stupid idea. What if, on the long, his dream was to become a singer and he's like, I'm done being bad, I'm gonna pursue my dreams now and I'm gonna become a singer. And then there's a singing minigame. Hear me out, the singing minigame would be... Singing minigame would be, you're standing there and he goes Right? And then you as Mario, you have to press B, A or Z to go at different pitches and it like makes a song together when you both do it right. Is that a banger idea or what? Rhythm Heaven, but Rhythm Hell. It would be a very simple minigame, you would just have like buttons scroll across the bottom of the screen and there's like one thing like this and then as soon as the button is around that, plus minus like five six frames. Yeah. Amazing idea, good, good. And his dream was always to be a singer, he asked you to do it, he goes Errk, errk, errk for the song. Mario goes yahoo, wah, yah or other sounds. I'm undecided for the song. When you play this song well enough, he thanks you with a star. For the rhythm minigame that gives you a top hat when you beat it. No! Do you have any idea how annoying a top hat from Mario would be to program? Oh god. There we go, that's another overwhelmed event star. Um 8, 14, 21, 30. 8, 14, 21, 30. How? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Okay, well that solves that. Making fnf? That's not fnf. That has existed before in other games. I'm not sure how good an idea this is, but let's not start like an easy-to-code minigame. It is pretty easy to code. It's gonna take me like an hour or two at most. What about a cycling end credits scene showing Mario, Albany, Albany? That's already planned, yeah. Anyway, let's get back to making the volcano. Metal lava land? This isn't bad. Yeah, metal lava land. It kind of works, yeah. I think music player got right in the first area of the body too, is a good idea. What do you mean by a music player specifically? Okay. That's kind of a sick texture. I don't like it a lot. It means that the top has cracks with lava visible in it and have the lava glow. That's the idea. That's what I'm working on right now. What did he already furnished? I don't think it will be a tiki bar. It's just going to be him singing. Hello, retro gaming is awesome. Yeah, there is a bar somewhere. Although the bar only exists because I have to put something. Hello, Esco. Oh, the vine diner. Let's see. I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this area. So, I probably need much more contrast here. For that to work at all. It might be best to just go with a decal. You know, just saying, fuck it, this isn't gonna work. So, it sucks. Yo, thank you for the 100 bits, Angelus. I'm glad you're enjoying my games. Sorry, I missed something. Something about lava, smoke, smoke as plant, yes. Yeah, definitely. So, I'm part that's like wonderfully moving barplanes and it looks a bit awkward. Oh, okay, yeah. That part, I had a lot of trouble making that part semi work. So, if you think it sucks, you might be right on the money. So, I think the red has potential, but it's like kind of poopy right now. I'll try that. So, if you want to just completely change the section Biobak, I'm fine with that. I'm not 100% that set on that area. It hasn't been gameplay tested yet, so there is a chance that like it will change anyway. I like the texture too. So, let's see if I have any good lava textures here. Honestly, I think you're right that they're basically placed at random. So, I'm not 100% sure what you mean by that. So, oh, you're parodying someone. Never mind. So, we're gonna have to be darkened on and kind of you could kind of throw out the glowy lava later. Oh, yeah, I'm not too worried about that. Okay, this is a Fast64 bug. And this is also a Fast64 bug. And that is also a Fast64 bug. And this is also a Fast64 bug. Well, it's hard to tell what it looks in-game. In Fast64, the opacity is usually a lot higher than it is in-game. So, you might just, you know, be seeing the blender thing and thinking about it in terms of blender instead of in-game. So, well, we still need to import this new cap over the falling cap, but I will only do that near the end of the project because we've been reworking Mario so much. Yeah, but they have been saying that they don't really like the flower entrance here too much. I think it's fine, but you know, you definitely need to upgrade it. I think this should have a darker shade at the front, that's actually kind of bothering me now. This looks so boneless, chicken wings. Yeah, that's what I've been saying too the whole time. That I'm just throwing out ideas and making decent shaders. And that Biobak will polish it up and make it look better. But chat, you know how chat is. That's way better. What's the advantage of adding brushlets? Yes! Tint us with the hard R, like that's true. Ramps or goats? What? I guess goats can sometimes be called ramps, you know? But this is a programming stream and a game development stream. I would imagine when someone was a ramp, they did not mean a goat. I don't know. Well, if you like the idea and you like the shaders I used, then I did my job good. That's fine, if you think it's too noisy, then that's also fine. Like, we don't need to worry about that right now. Would a mission map work well with Macro and the Volcano if it's possible? I don't know what that is. Hmm. Now the question is, how do we continue the worlds here? We could just use this wall again, paste it on here. Also, I definitely need to separate this decal here. Whenever I don't separate decals, I break them. Hello, John John. I want to show you guys something cool. How consistent Return to Yoshi's Island movement feels. I might first try this, but there's like six frame-perfect inputs in the sequence I'm trying to do. Last time I did this, I failed first try it. And this is not... Okay, nevermind, I broke it. I won't be showing it to you, too bad. I can show you a video. Look how cool this feels. I'm currently working on making the zoo gameplay work. The movement is so fun. Sunflowers at the entrance? Maybe. I don't really care too much about that right now. I think this part looks awkward, and it should change. Is that a plane? Yes, it is. Yeah, the sparkles work very well. Okay, now the question is, how long do we continue these mountainous walls? We could just continue them along the outside wall. Along here, along here, along here, along here, along here, you know. And then we have them around the entire island. And then here as well. And it's like, you know, doing the entire island in this wall texture. But I think that would be a little lame. So where should this wall texture end? The mission is to make things glow, but requires an extra texture black and white. But honestly, I'm just not good at explaining things. Sounds like that's not a thing on the N64. Would you guys like to see a video of me recreating the coins from Mario Odyssey perfectly on the N64? And then have it run well on the N64? Should this go to B1 at least? Yeah, it is built into there. The question is maybe if the walls outside the island should look different. You know, maybe it transitions into a different texture. I kind of like the idea of every mountain looking the same. I think this would look better if it was taller like so. Being forced to make every wall look the same would be a little bit of a curse, I think. And the B1 entrance originally used this texture here. I don't know. Hmm. This shouldn't feel so complicated. Hmm. Hmm. It's fine. Should I make coast-to-coast matches? What's the response going to do? Oh. Yeah, I see what you mean. I think we could significantly improve the UV map if we just make it a little splitsy here. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Whatever. Not for us right now to worry about. Hmm. So I could just alpha transition to a different texture in here. And I think that would be fine. Because I think what we should have is another texture that looks similar. Or that has a similar shade of color, but looks different. Does it make sense for a mountain to have two very different visuals like that? I don't know. To me it kind of makes sense, because one part of the mountain is near the water and the other one is not. Surely that makes a difference, right? Hmm. Is Minecraft 2? No. Hmm. This also in all, I think it does not need crazy good transitions. It for sure does. This also feels like one of those corners where we should just say, um, bots instead of tris. Hmm. This is going to make our lives so much easier. Yeah, that's what I like to see. So I think it's not going to work, because the tool doesn't like holes in geometry like that. That's what I thought. Hmm. Someone should tell the developer that that's silly. But I get that it's not so easy to fix like that. Hmm. Let's add some saturation. A little more saturation. Maybe? Hmm. Okay, that looks like the same color to me. And then we would have the texture transition here. Does that make any sense? No, like, I kind of don't think it makes any sense. Hmm. Hmm. Maybe I should just make it and see what happens. Maybe it looks completely fine. Hmm. Hmm. What the hell? Huh? Hmm. I'm chugging away at this. I stopped in a few days and the work completed now compared to then is huge. People always complain in the moment like, oh, this is so slow. And then they come back a few days and they're like, holy shit, we did so much done. That is funny.  Does this look fine? I think maybe not. Like it's smooth, but the textures don't work well together. The music you're hearing is Diddy Kong racing.  Yeah. The text just don't work well together. No matter how often I look at this. Oh, the music silver. Need an OST. Let's see what else David Rice made. David Rice relaxing music compilation. He made the Yooka-Laylee music. Really? I thought he was a good guy. What's up when you transition? You don't see shit when you transition. I keep saying Yooka-Laylee is the definition of a mid game. There's nothing egregiously bad about it, but there's also nothing to enjoy about it. It's like, it feels like someone really really wanted to make a game, but they had no game they wanted to make. This year, are all the rock types producing the same on the island? Like this is an islanded game from a hotspot in the crust. Checks out. You didn't find it mid, you thought it kinda sucked. I mean, I guess that's the consequence of that. Of it being mid, of it like being nothing to enjoy, but there also really wasn't anything you could complain about, right? That's the thing. Or, well, evidently there was something you could complain about. Physical lead waste of time. Portfolio plan to developers? Yes! I mean, yeah, I don't disagree with that. I'm just saying there's like nothing that stands out as bad. Is there a beautiful OST playing? Donkey Kong Country, Simeon Segue. Mid can be enjoyed, anything below mid can't. So it's below mid. I see. If it wasn't on Retirement Island, it would be more interesting. That's true. I think it's fair to say that it's an extremely deeply uninteresting game. This basically just looks like the same dog. This must be one of the issues that make the OG game, right? No. Okay, we have a very different view on games, I think. The purpose of any art piece really is to make you feel something, right? And you kind of have to take all the elements and turn them in a way where the feeling you want the player to experience becomes real. Yooka-Laylee didn't feel to me like it had any feeling it was going for. It felt like it was taking all the audiovisual language that makes games as a medium and just threw it together, aimlessly, like random doodles, almost like AI generated poems, you know, completely pointless. Soulless, you could say. Polishing it up is still going to make it that. It might be a very polished piece of feel-nothing, but it's still gonna be that. That's my analysis of it. This texture is kind of different, yeah? I kind of like it. Do you hate the banjo games? To be honest, I haven't beaten the banjo games. This is a German view of art. What? And the Yooka-Laylee reboot is supposed to fix level design and layout, dialogue and collectibles. Yeah, that sounds like it's just polishing it up. But you could fake glowing insects and emissions around the time in the early 2000s. You can definitely make things look like they're glowing, yeah? I think this shader looks fine. And it does look visibly more grungy than the other one. Especially the transition here feels very noisy. But I think then once you come around the corner, it should be fine. Maybe? This is so banjo-kazooie-coded. I don't know the definition of art. If it says something about the human condition, that doesn't necessarily come still. I'm trying to think of an example of something that would commonly be considered art that by definition wouldn't be art. I'm sure there is an example. Something that doesn't say anything but makes you feel something. I guess a Marvel movie would fit under that. Something that just exists to make you feel the idea of cool, but it doesn't really say anything about the human condition. Which I guess if you want to exclude Marvel movies from your definition of art, then I'm perfectly fine with that. I hate them. Hehe. Oh, and these textures look significantly worse in-game. So when you make the weapon after Nado, would you prefer the OG game to be what we're getting now? But I've lost confidence in the team just yet. Interesting. Favorite animal? Uh, hard question because I really like cats, but I also really like plecos. Yeah, these textures look like garbage because they are not detailed enough and they're so up-close-to-the-view. The second animal, pleco. An old banana-coloring art made out of that brick base and wooden ramparts complete with a cannon. Um, something like that exists, kinda. I can show you the area for it, one second. So this is supposed to be the area with a bunch of broken castles in the background. I guess you can kind of see them. And the idea is that during the events of Mario World 2, all these castles have been destroyed, and this is kind of like the area where all of Bowser's minions hang out. A lot of frogs. Not a big fan of frogs. That says things using feelings. If I just want to talk about the recognition, I'm not feeling that would be an essay. Yeah? And if you notice, I don't consider games art by classifications. Games are art as elements. Textures are art by gameplay itself. I don't always consider it art. It's also a very stupid view, in my opinion. It seems like a view that, like, you had the idea to exclude games from your definition of art, and then you came up with the definition of art afterwards, specifically to exclude games. What if you could pick up cannonballs from a hermit's deck, load the cannon, and blast some more? I don't really like that, because you can get the bomb cap. It seems to interfere with that element of the game. Oh, I actually have a banger idea for a combiner. Just now, fresh off the oven. Let me try that. I call this the rescale combined alpha combiner. I don't know who Rogar Ebert is. I'll be honest, I know very little about pop culture or philosophy or something like that. I think it is all stupid. All the ideas I present is just stuff I thought of. Oh, this gives it like a Chocomountain vibe. I kind of like it. Berserk is pretty good. He's an old film reviewer. Dude, I remember there was a YouTube video called something like why philosophy is difficult to bring to the people, and I commented something like it's because it's fucking stupid, and then someone somehow from that comment found my discord and told me, oh, so you think his philosophy is stupid? I hope you get raped. This is your champion? Is the guy sending fucking random rape threats to me? Bro is so stupid he became his own straw man. So let's increase the color precision. We can take one of these and increase its color precision, and judging by this, I think it makes sense to go with this one here. When did that happen? Oh, that happened a while ago. Jeez, that's brutal. I mean, obviously I don't care because one, I am a man, two, I can bench 315 pounds, and three, that guy was probably 14 years old, so I wasn't very scared. So put a lot of fallen rocks onto the path. If I remember, something like this was even planned for part two. It was kind of supposed to be like a jungle foresty path type thing. So I kind of wanted it to run the other way. Oh, but that looks worse actually. Okay guys, do not lose your shit just yet. So now we have a rescale combiner. We can change primitive color to change the range of the texture. Isn't that cool? So we can do something like this. Actually, we could invert this too. Make shade color the dark one, and primitive color the white one. This makes more sense. So now primitive color is this, and we can change shade color like so to get more or less detail. So now I want a lot of detail here, and I can reduce the detail up here. So and with that, I can also make the transition here less jarring. So I bet you saw that. You think my rescale combiner is cool? Sorry, I wasn't paying attention for a bit. We can never put him on the side of the mountain, I thought. Yeah, kinda. Shit that is not less true. Why stay a triangle next to the first level entrance? Just like in-game. Fast 64 bug. In the state of playtonic, the first game set high expectations, but it came out super mid. The last game impossible air was pretty good. I hated it. I hated the platformers. I thought it was the publishing games or the cocoon. I didn't know they were publishing games. Okay, I think I disagreed with pretty much everything you said. I don't know if it's gonna come out before GTA 6. Oh yeah, that looks cool. That kind of makes the texel density by screen space pixels even better, because it becomes less dense at the top. Almost like a level of detail. Yeah, I think it's pretty nice. I don't know if you're unable. The heart. Is it just your real name? I was thinking for the final game we'll leave it untextured, just so people can appreciate the hard work we put into texturing the rest of the game. What if this faded into pure red at the bottom? Biron is such an old name. I was in class with a guy named Biron. Actually Biron was a pretty common name. No, I don't think Biron is an old name. That's crazy. What? Maybe it's a regional difference. Bro, no one can play the isometric place in Yooka-Laylee and tell me that that's fine. No, I know at least like two or three Birons for sure, or rather I knew. I do not know That looks extremely intense right now, but I bet it's not that intense in-game. I don't know if ideas need an expansion or if they're just for no-word-while ideas. It's not a scary displacement map, plus regenerated gravel by the way, but something that gives it more sense of surrounding moving around you, like ground textures. No no no no, we're going with full, single color. People should appreciate what they have. That's what people get for not being thankful for the little things, you know? Maybe now they'll learn. I don't know what an SDK is. I can make it solid color, isn't it? True, they would still be glazing. Dude, there has been so much more glazing recently. Have you guys noticed? Not just here, I mean like in the entire world. Solid color! Unthankful for Caleb White's VRM for you. Yeah, I'm gonna reduce the resolution of the screen to 64x32 next time you ask for anything. Well, I think it means software development kit, but what is a software development kit? Is it like a physical thing people send to you? Have you seen the ChenGPT glaze kit? Yes, I did! Dude, we actually had a discussion about this in RomShack. So, in case you guys don't know, you can ask ChenGPT, estimate my IQ, and ChenGPT will never say anything below like 130. He always tells you that you're a genius level, basically. And the theory is that ChenGPT starts glazing people, telling people like, oh, you're so smart, in order to increase user retention, to make people feel good about using it. And this is actually very scary, because I think it's working, because people like compliments even from a fucking bot, and I also think that most real interactions are going to unwillingly be replaced with bot interactions, and people are going to be manipulated hard. I think five years from now, we'll have whole real life catastrophes that don't actually exist. People will just believe they exist, because the internet tells them about it. And that's going to start so much more stuff. People will not believe anything anymore. You know, I keep saying like, I'm 99% sure that the continent of Australia exists. People are going to be like 50% sure about that. 8x8? You drive a hard bargain, dude. I think maybe I can give you an 8x8 floor. That already happens. It's going to get worse. Could you pull up a video of ShyGuySaysMark about a minigame, both on Minion? Wait, why? Still getting the insane conspiracy theory validated Yeah. Why are we looking at this? Ireland. Ireland. Xenix is in the same studio as the I don't get it. Is this ShyGuy? What about... Okay, the plant man said he was going to be here in one minute. So I might have to go meet the plant man at the door. I hope Zeina doesn't knock the plant man out. He doesn't really want those plants, man. Belt bundle here. Let me google that. Wait, why? Why is he a wild west guy? What is the goal right now? I'm so confused. Could this be the mythical cobblestone use case? That honestly looks kind of nice. He's pretty tropical, with a fat fella in a fort setting. See him when he turns around. What about the ammo? Oh, you want him to be in the area with the Bowser minions. Oh. I was going to have mostly Bob-ombs running around here. No special guys, except for the entrance guy that won't let you in until you have enough stars. I should save this combiner. I'm going to scale... multitex. I don't scale with sword. I don't think we did that with the Goombos. I think Biobak just remade them. You might also not be familiar with the fact that we literally have a ghost Shy Guy that plays Shy Guy Sass with you. So he already kind of exists, but like as a dead pirate. One second. I heard Zayna talk to someone. Is that my plants? Nope. Nope. This looks so much better than this. What the hell? There we go. I guess it's also the scale of the texture. Oh well. When you paint these kind of stuff, isn't this something that could be automated when they're using metrics like ambient optimization? Maybe? I'm not sure. But I'm sure it wouldn't be as good as I want it to be. How do you get the contactless? Online. Right, I have to rescale the grass. Almost forgot. Did Davis Weiss make this? That's crazy. Does one or two really dark pixels kind of piss me off in this texture? Okay, my plants are there. Guys, I'll be back in maybe 5-10 minutes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hello? I am back. I got a huge package of plants. That is just what I wanted. So, one second, what did I miss? Why in the geography region is the valley there? IRL would either be from a river or tectonics, there should probably be grass and not have which a sharp 90 degree connection to the walls. We need the sharp 90 degree connection, without it, gameplay-wise, it just wouldn't work. Is he taking a shit? No, I was getting plants, guys. It's very mixing, but what about adding sparse tufts of stringy green grass along the wall in order to get rid of the choco mountain for you? Yeah, yeah, probably. And don't worry about backseating, backseating is explicitly encouraged. That is not at all the color I took from there. What the hell? That looks more like it. What the fuck? What the fuck? It's a little better, oh well. Even along the cracks of rocks in the middle of the flooring. That could look cool, but man, that would be so annoying to deal with for a while back. We can't do that right now. That would be like an end of game thing. Oh, is it a rocky floor here and grass floor elsewhere? Then we can have more story-telling, let's see. No, you're right. I would say the reason is that there is a volcano here. And I think here we can transition it into a more grassy area. So there's a little rocky path and then all grass again. Also your suggestion was that this path here would be grass, this part? I think that might also work. Although I think it's cool if this is still... Wait, that's a problem that you can do that. We don't want the player doing that. We'll find a solution though, don't worry. I can't fix the light pass, it's a bug in the exporting tool. I have to fix pass 64. Yeah, the idea is that this is a very volcano area, right? So there can't really be grass here. And then this is still a volcano area. But then over here it becomes friendly again and grass can grow. I think I might have to put this at a higher elevation. Like so. Okay. Okay.  I'm just doing this to import the shadows in case you're wondering what the fuck I'm doing. Okay. How? How, how, how, how, how? Oh.  I think this is too far down. Somewhere like this. And this. And this. Use this as an extra curve.  Like that. Fully transparent. Take the color. Fully green. Some dark edges. Oh. Maybe this one should be a little yellowish. To show that we've been fighting the lava. Like that.  Does the rock have a black button? Should it become transparent? Yes, it's an export bug. Can't really do anything about it right now. No, I know exactly what you mean, Alan. And I agree that that's a good idea. Yeah, this is kind of sweet. I kind of like it. Okay. We're supposed to look in it and it should be obsidian. Let me see what obsidian is. Okay. So it'd be black, like that. That would look, like, color-wise it would look good. I don't know. I like the idea that, like, it's been a couple months since the last volcano eruption destroyed this.  Also, one thing important for if we want the lava to go down this way, is that this part is a little lower than the rest of the volcano. Yep, that makes the volcano look even more menacing.  Yeah, and then I agree with, like, sheets of grass that go out of the cracks. Not sheets, like, individual bushes. Let's try that. Just so we don't forget. Okay. He made a button for the cutscene. The cutscene skip button. That looks like Diddy Kong Racing. And it's not centered. No, no, what I need is just the inside part. And I think it needs to be a grayscale one. I don't think this quite works for what I'm trying to do. I don't know. I've never experienced obsidian. Many types of obsidian. Some are glassy, and others are tiny. Yeah, I'm not familiar with what you're talking about, to be honest. Yeah, I'm just trying to find a good flat plane image for that right now. I mean, this Mario Odyssey grass is pretty simple and kind of works. Of course, this flower here also kind of works. I think this is way too much grass. Way too much grass. This is kind of what we're looking for.  I wish it was just one of these. That one looks fine. Do I not have just a single bush of grass? A single tuft? Yeah, I think this is basically exactly what you're thinking of. And I like it. Let's take a look at our two bushels of grass. Man, there's so much delay. It really makes it difficult to talk to chat. I feel like you guys hear what I say like two minutes after. Oh, thanks. Let's see what we've got. Ah, yes! This is what I was looking for. That works. That's a good fast-forward button. Yeah, I think... Hehe. Have you guys ever played N64 Wheel of Fortune? It's fucking hilarious. With its outdated questions from like 1996. And then the characters are 2D sheets. And they go, I'll spin! And they all have like two voice lines each. Peek.  Oh, yes. They don't have vertex colors yet. But I know vertex colors, so you're happy. First he asked for like a rock path, and now he wants vertex colors? God, this guy is so greedy. What the hell? How is this not affecting them? What? Oh, well. It is what it is. I guess the colors just don't interpolate very well. Oh, now it works. Oh, I see. Alright. Anyway, I wanna go do my plans now. So I will see you guys next stream, which I don't know when that is yet. So, bye bye!
