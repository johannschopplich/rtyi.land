Oh, there we go. You can now hear my voice. Hello fun guy. Hello Leela. You made the train track lower at the start? Yes, yes I did. Hello Clayman. Hello 2S2W. Hello Sonic the Hedgehog. Heck yeah, case N64 devstream. Let's fucking go. So where we gonna program this guy here? He steals your coins. Loud alert. Yo, thank you for the $5 donation, MPG. Yo, what up? So this guy basically he steals your coins and if you catch him stealing your coins, he basically says no and then he will run off. This is gonna be the last Yoshi coin in this level and after that it is time to make the collision work. Hello Luke. Hello Selton, hello Neovim. Run off to where? The distance. He will run the direction of the bridge here, I'm thinking. And then just disappear like the wiglet does. Uh, any OST wishes for the day? Any wishes? Can we kill him? Yes, actually, but I'm not gonna tell you how, it's a bit of an easter egg. Mario Party 2, sounds like a good one. Hello pretty cool crocodile. Why don't you add in Luigi as an unlockable character? Why don't you get some bitches? I don't know. Hello Scareduft. Racing Lagoon OST. Okay, fine, we do Racing Lagoon. I wanna add a visual here when he steals your coins. It should spawn a little bit of a coin thing and then it just moves. Can we do MP2 OST after this one? Sure. We streamed yesterday and I thought you wouldn't and then I panicked and would have to wait another week. Nope, it was just a bonus stream. Hello Tiberius. So, this should be a LURB, I think. Just copy this. Guys, I asked a question on Snake Overflow, biggest mistake of my life. I posted this and they're just asking me for more and more information, that doesn't do anything. They want me to make a minimal reproducible example. Do you want me to write you a code that starts two threads on the N64 and adds the register thing? That's a little bit unreasonable. If you don't know how to get rid of the warning, shut up. I don't know if you ever worked with emissive maps, but have you ever faced a situation where some of the emissives are too strong for no reason? Nope. Never had that issue. I have worked with those before in Unreal Engine. Yeah, and AI said it's not fixable, so it is what it is. If you consider targeting a different platform, yep, that's what they would say. If you consider writing your own compiler, true, true. If you consider just not doing the thing that is optimal, if you consider just doing this differently so that it's worse, why aren't you just making this worse? I think that's a bit of an issue. Where's my lerp function? It's right here. Weird. How do you feel about AI being teachless? That would be great, actually. There's a bit of a shortage. Being able to do that faster, or better, would be great, I think. Have fun? Oh no, buzzfeed time? Oh no, this Nintendo Hot or Not character quiz will reveal what percent kink you are. Alright guys, we're doing this thing. Link? Not. Zelda? Twilight Princess? Not really. It's not really my type. Fox? No. Boo? No. Samus? Fine. Luigi? No. No. Not really. Maybe a little bit. I'm in a Mario Kart Wii, yes. In Mario Galaxy? No. No. No. No. In Mario Kart Wii, yes. Here? No. No. No. No. No. No. 75%? How did I get 75%? I said yes once. May I have done random? Yeah, I think so too. Damn, I guess I'm a pervert for thinking Zero Suit Samus is hot. You know what? Let's actually test this out with random answers. What do I get now? Surely this would be 50%, right? Because I'm saying hot to half of them. 100%. Okay. Sure. Hello, Nicolas. Once again, I come and say hi, come out, and then you read it, I think. True. This is disgusting. I'm out of here. Sorry. True. How do you make a parabola with around 20? It has to be like X minus 20 point F, multiply by X minus 20 point F, something like that. Then the high point would be at zero. And this is minus. And the lowest point is at 20, where it's 400. So we add 400. But then it goes up to 400, which is too high. So we multiply by 0.25 F. Shout out if you passed 8th grade math, you would have learned what I just did. Hello, Arthur. You tried all nodes and got 50%. Dang. Well, Arthur, you see, this is not my fault. We have an incentive where if you have enough channel points, you can make me do a Buzzfeed quiz. This guy is so chill. Wait, what? What? What the fuck? Okay, there's a bug here. We needed this line of code. If you say no a bunch, that means you're very specific with your sexual preference, which means you have more chance to be kinky. Yeah, that makes total sense. I mean, if you're not into Yoshi, you have to be real kinky, right? This guy's trying to rob you, so when you look away, he sneaks up on you. There was supposed to be a coin spawned here. Right now, I have 213 coins. 212. So he steals coins out of my inventory. That's the idea. And then when you catch him stealing from you, he should say something like, oh, I wasn't doing anything and then run off and spawn a Yoshi coin. Leela, have you ever gotten a name from Mario? Wait, you got the Roach one, I remember. Dude, I love the Marios, these names. We need more of them. It would be fun if you removed 5-10% of your obtained stars at random.  And then you just have to get them again. We just removed them from the P-ROM. You know what? If you have no coins here, he should say something like, wow, you're broke. Okay, this is an Easter Egg. Easter Egg, wow, you're broke. I take pity on you. At zero, he's like, dude, you have no money. You really need some. I take pity on you. Here's a Yoshi coin for you. Oh, you're broke and he gives you a Yoshi coin out of pity. Does Blayton TTYD? What? I wasn't even thinking of TTYD. He called you a slur. No, that was the Sans guy. He called you a slur. Well, he does give you money if you're broke. He gives you the Yoshi coin, which is five coins. Now, why does the coin not do the coin things that I want it to do? This is not why. That robs you and you have to catch him to get your shit back. Oh, well, that's not what we do here. We just turn around. Because you're broke if you have no coins. That is funny. But I just thought of that without even knowing of TTYD. So it's clearly not plagiarism. Well, typical case, ripping off the one good game in the world, TTYD. Can you believe not every game is TTYD? Why would they do this? It would be funny to have to catch him. Kind of. But there's already two bandits you have to catch. So I don't want to overdo it, you know. There are two good games. The other one is 64. Oh, TTYD HD. Is that one already released? Let's just take this out here. Maybe I did my function wrong. Hello, UED. Welcome to the Devstream. We're currently making this bandit here. If you look away, he's...        Trying to steal coins from you. And if you look at them, he's all surprised. Currently, we're making it so that he actually takes coins out of your inventory. But the coins that he takes don't render. Oh, I know why. I know why. It's missing something. This is gonna sound crazy, but... header.gfx.node.flex IsCoin. Yes, there is a flag for if you are a coin. No, this is not primarily an e-circ. Primarily, this is the way to get a Yoshi coin. I crashed? I didn't crash. You crashed. All right, steal my money, boy. It's still not showing up. Imagine just going AFK here and having all your coins be stolen. That would be so funny if it happened to someone. Oh, that's something in here that's just doing it. Let's see if the coin spawns at all now. If he steals all your money, does he give you a fight back when you're broke? He does. Probably gonna be at least 1 billion. Person who thinks you get the coin by having him steal all your coins no it still doesn't spawn the Yoshi coin also didn't spawn it was there but it was invisible wait some bizarre things are going on here I'm just gonna 100 coin star run no there's a 100 coin star in this how would even you to turn your back on him it's because okay I'll show you how even if you just normally play the game and you're like walk past him you're eventually gonna turn around and he makes a noise and he like jumps back right so even if you don't if he doesn't steal from you and then he also is like really weird text it's just I I nothing hmm so he's a really sassy guy and then he follows you like you can tell something's up with this guy and you probably get curious what happens if you don't do anything and then he steals your coins and you're probably gonna turn around you're not just gonna walk away I think it's pretty likely that something's gonna happen here maybe I also need the billboard here yeah most viewers are on Twitch and currently have 64 viewers but I have to say I'm noticing though true there's some Yoshi coins that don't imagine people will find just like that that I mentioned they will need the radar for right we do have the radar in the end so you will see all the special actions should get closer to Mario's short arms that's really easy to do we can do that why is this behavior ever used really shouldn't be let's see if this does something well there be 100% reroll for Yoshi coins you will get a star for every five you get like we find all of them in a level you get a star basically that's my idea yeah we just started to stream more people are gonna pour in I'm sure after this by the way we're done with the level all that will be missing is some animations then Zayna's currently working on and the sign okay now the coin appears all right all right all right we just need to make some change now what do we want for 100% in general probably like a champion's route after this you will be done with the note true Biobak still has some work to do after but Doop is also currently making a song for the Western dual scene I believe so that's gonna be very fun yes the Yoshi coins are our replacement for the 100 coin stars the thing about the 100 coin stars is I think the way 100 coin stars are done in Mario Sunshine is great and I know people hate them but hear me out I think people would hate them less if you didn't have to get them in one go and the thing about the Mario Sunshine 100 coin stars is that you get them by interacting with the environment in like creative ways and that's how I want the Yoshi coins to work as well we have a lot of places where you can be creatively with the environment and we before you did the Yoshi coins so tying reward to that hopefully fuels that like sense of exploration they are like lesser rewards we can put on the world because if you just hit coins like you're not gonna care right what are you gonna do with 10 coins if you're not going for the 100 coin star the duel music is not gonna be anything specific but it is gonna be similar to the cave music I can show you that too in a second let me just leave stolen coin take this out take this out do not make it static I'll be real with you I don't like the racing Lagoon OST let's listen to Mario Party 2 unfortunately the music is a little too annoying and I'll show you the hideout music it is pretty hype man this level is so fun to run around in I think we did a good job of the geometry it was a good thing I showed this to people before I started making this because people had a lot of really good feedback on it to make the platforming better I also had a few good ideas watching my clip videos is not a prerequisite to watching the streams whoops I thought that jump was possible but you know what you're right that one song is really annoying in Mario Party it's gonna be like this but without the HMC and without the reverb but yeah let's check if the coin works now and then we can do the text for him oh yeah I wanna I wanna go over the entire game at the end and make sure that the ambient everywhere is perfect I wanna be in every level turn off the background music and just take in the ambient noise and make sure it's like there to direct my friends to good the bad and the ugly oh that's fitting all right let's see what he steals that's funny it should just be a bit faster I love I'm not subtle it is he's suspiciously non suspicious you know what I mean it looks like the math here is wrong can you have a desire supermark count the beans best possible game ever more stories essential that is we realized the beans are metaphor for his own most of existing is chilling what would what be funny hangout spot this kind of is a hangout spot there this is true oh I see why it should be like this and then this should be yes this is readable code first I'm getting to watch life well I'm sure you've gotten this question before what are your future products if you have any more custom series from the Amazon so in the future I would like to put some of the optimizations back to the base game but that's not a very interesting project I would like to make another ocarina of time heck but that's not a very lucrative project like I would want to make like a former ocarina of time major heck for also some optimizations most likely it will be my own game made in Unreal Engine just cuz I have to think about the financial aspects as well dude where is this going going this is 10 and where's this X coming from it was just the exposition whoops you like the train CD they're even cooler than you think let me show you something they have a sound render radius this was not something that the original r64 could do where it's like they have a different sound fall off and then when they come nearby you hear them and they absolutely murder you there we go he's stealing all your pocket money it should spawn sparkles at the end and then I think we've got it I could maybe make it a little bit faster too let's try 16 no I would actually just do it from modern computers unfortunately in my engine we call on the unit after spawn after spawning something because of threat race conditions next let's do the text here hello George 409 and 410 yes we have 410 text boxes in this game now that's almost three times vanilla Mario 64 two and a half times right now but there's still three levels missing so we probably have three times as much content as vanilla mario 64 as well which is kind of insane the race conditions and competing against each other to see is faster it's when you have two different threads of code running at the same time and you need to guarantee that one code finishes before the other that's a race condition hello Michi what does he say when you spot him I was goodbye uh I don't need their partner something like that maybe not what did you you it's gonna rob your pockets empty but it appears you have more need for the coins than I do you drop these partner goodbye oh I like that you drop these partner goodbye I'm gonna ask such a pity to translate this to cowboy making this sounds more like all boys said this let's see for now I was fixing to light your pockets on but it looks like you're in more need of them pennies than I am I like it you're watching this life in the bus holy shit real bus I'm not sure justice that is honestly my main use for chachi PT at the moment as a cowboy translation machine well let's have him drop our coins while we're sleeping he does jump when when you look at them and we still gonna have to give him an animation I don't think I make him shaky because he's a bandit he's not nervous right that doesn't fit the personality good I mean come on it's again if it's any relevant other script setting and getting them so it's not good for composition or bad I have no idea bro just stole everything from me but I was six and died in your pocket some but it looks like you're in more need of some coins than I am okay well you should say that after stealing all your coins you know what I still have to do there's one clip I still need to upload I haven't done this yet I was looking I was being smart about this I'm looking for a YouTube sponsor and then as soon as I have to sponsor I'll upload this I don't know where it is awesome but I had a really cool idea it was just like the chain jump in the zoo for ten minutes and I was just gonna put the sponsor in now Mario 220 coins the coins are gonna be just in the pause menu and maybe they appear when you connect the coin or lose one I think change jump in the zoo is like a perfect clip to just rip a YouTube sponsor off with and let's make the escape route for him and of course I would never rip off a YouTube sponsor if you are watching I make very serious sponsorships you should sponsor my videos yeah exactly it's not a rip-off it's actually a banger video I need to get this one to the video video you show the zoo for 30 seconds then you do the sponsorship then you show the zoo for another 10 minutes Nope, you will never get through the ages on real hardware. You're not gonna get most techs on real hardware, unfortunately. Usually when someone makes a hack, at the very beginning they decide whether they wanna target real hardware or not. And then most of the time people say no. So, it is what it is. I forgot to make this part of the level, oops. Guys can you believe that after one and a half years of being unable to get payments from Patreon, they finally made it so that my account works again? And now finally Patreon works again, just in time for tech season. Only took them one and a fucking half years. And Paypal still doesn't work. Fun fact, any money you send me on Paypal, I can't use it. It's all just frozen in time. For some reason. Literally the two worst services. Guys if you ever wanna make a Patreon, do not use Patreon, use Ko-fi or something. They take a smaller cut and they're not as dogshit to work with. Yeah, I like being able to refer any variable from anywhere. Of course that might cost you more RAM or have a really long compile time, so there's that risk associated with it. Nope, I don't know what subscribe star is. I think we should make the account small here. Sick Patreon, but I've heard it doesn't suck as bad, unless it's an ad on some section so I can then correct them. What are you talking about? Oh, subscribe star, I see. Yeah, the thing about Patreon is that it has like a higher amount of customer trust because it's like more official, whereas if I use subscribe star or something, people might be reluctant to be a member of that. Thank you Osvaldo Hjulz, I will make sure to buy viewers there next time I wanna buy Cheapest viewer, sign me up. Don't worry, you are my cheapest viewer. And where does the cutscene end? Oh, right here. There is a follow path function we have. Oh, this is a banger. We can just use this. Oh, that's so good. I don't know if cheapest viewer is a compliment or an insult. Is there a restriction on some requests? Yeah, if it's annoying, I'll just remove it. There is also kind of a time limit, so depending on how much you donate the time limit is longer. It costs a lot of money to look this cheap. Alright, let's see how this works out. We look away. Uh, you're not the spartaner, goodbye. What the fuck? Wow, that looks really good. Thank you. Thank you. Doing my best here. The progress is a U32 variable? Oh, that's not good. It's clearly a U16. I don't like that this is in two different places. We gotta move to somewhere else. Maybe here. Object help us. Get me object helpers. U16, no dude, I'm 32. Why is Poki's face sprite so scary in Mario 64? That's a good question. Mario 64 has a lot of really weird and really early art, doesn't it? Yeah, this would also be an issue. Well, we don't really need this. All right, let's try this again. My brain doesn't use itself. Can someone convince my wife that it's okay for men to just have a buzzcut? My hair is very annoying. You are annoying. What the hell, Lila? Hello, Divas. Hello, Asco. Why is he so goddamn fast? Oh, because he moves twice. That's why. You know what? We can mitigate this. It's not an issue. The rumors from Momos. Clementa buzzcuts? Why? Dude, this goes hard. Fucking he looks like Duke Nukem. That's not a buzzcut, I think. Doesn't look good on a resume. To do it the longer case. It's so annoying, though. Insert Dan voice. Dan's Mario voice would fit him. Have you heard Dan's Mario voice? We need him to jump at this point. Of course. Oh, OK. I didn't know you were that deep into the lore of Mr. Dan. What have we been doing this, like, a few years now? Maybe like three? The broccoli hair? No, I don't want the broccoli hair. All right, this should do it now. I forgot the semicolon. If you have a bit on medication on accident. No. I bit on a caffeine pill once or twice on accident and it tastes like ass. Whoa, he froze me in time. Whoa. Are you sure it wasn't an ass pill? No? Maybe it was just ass and a pill. I'm settling. Dude, going outside is fucking wild. You meet people there. It's crazy. My life is not adventurous to actually meet people and be weird to them. I wish it was. It would be very funny to just see me interact with normal people. It would actually make for a good TV show. I'm going to change the train SFX. I wasn't planning to. Why does it freeze me? I feel like this code would have the answer to get unfrozen. Nope. Let's try it again, though. Today, my E got like behind my teeth and while trying to get it back, my tongue and eye on accident bit into it. Oh, you astrogen. Thing. This weird-ass guy at the realtor's workshop kept telling me how the rollingness of his wheels was off and I explained micro-adaptation to my assistant for 45 minutes. True. The rollingness of my wheels is probably pretty off. Our car sucks. I wish I didn't get frozen in time. Yeah, ethanol. Why are you taking ethanol? I know exactly what I'm doing. I'm making good progress on this cutscene. There's just a few weird things left. Also, I don't want this to stop. Why is this animation stopping? Because the timer of this thing doesn't keep increasing. Easy fix. I don't know what that means. But that's what I mean by E. Oh. We tripped while running away. True. It'd be easy to implement, but we would need the animation. Okay. Okay, guys. New rule. Stop badgering me with stupid-ass questions. C and C++ is basically the same thing. If you know C, you know C++. And if you know C++, you actually really well know C. That's stupid. Why won't the cutscene still end? I guess it ends because there is a star cutscene. What about the arrow gates? Do I just need to set this to 1? Is this a bug I introduced at some point? If this fixes it, then we also need to do this. Sorry for asking stupid questions. I don't remember you asking any questions. I don't know Kaki, I think 10 cents. Actually no, that would be a zero donation, maybe like a dollar, I don't know. The duplicate gravity is kinda cringe, that didn't fix it, cool, oh cool, I'll just turn the gravity into zoom, answer the question Mila, can you shut the fuck up, when you say C sharp is more like Java than C++ or C, everyone has a different opinion on the comparison, I don't know, never programmed C sharp, and I don't remember Java, I did Java in university and I passed the course like pretty easily, but I didn't go a single time to the classes, it literally just worked, I remember nothing about the syntax, I just derived the syntax from the tasks, see what they did in the exam is they gave us questions and then they also gave us pre-written tests and we had to pass the tests, so I could just go look at the test which was written in Java and from there derive the syntax and so I could just pass the exam without studying, oh you redeemed ask a stupid question, oh that's not on my screen, well then you're perfectly justified in asking that question, the answer is no, what language does the N6Y use, MIPS assembly, it's maybe more about the university and programming skills maybe, redeemed for could I, oh the answer is yes, you could, at least I think you could, I think you're capable, there, thank you Leela, thank you very much for the stupid question, oh wait, that genuinely wasn't a weird thing going on, that was actually just my code doing that, cool, why bladder window, are you eating sharp metals by chance, do you think gravity code for margiela is going to be implemented on r64, yes it is touring complete, hey Leela, wanna know something funny, guess how many raycasts one pokey takes, just throw out a random number guess, 24, 24, any other guesses, one pokey, 69, 41, why are you guys guessing such high numbers, it should be one raycast, that would be the correct thing, if it was one raycast per tick, yes one pokey object, man you guys guessed such high numbers, now if I say the real number you're just gonna be not impressed, I don't wanna say it anymore, like 6, well turns out it's more like 31, what, yeah, it's fucking insane, you made it seem like it was higher, higher than 24, dude 24 is a fucking massive amount, what do you mean, your first guess was for like 6 pokies, nope, there's one raycast per piece for some reason, then there's one raycast for the main body and then there's extra raycasts for every single body parts shadow, seems kind of excessive, yeah, I reduced it to one, I think that's a little more reasonable, yeah he has 2000 units of draw which is as much as a long jump, okay, there was something about this that I didn't like and I forgot what it was, the time when he jumped, we fixed that, maybe this is good as this, but I suck at video games, maybe you just have coordination issues, that's usually the main reason people suck at video games, they just didn't grow up, either they didn't rob playing sports very well or maybe you were just born unlucky, maybe it's just not in your genetics to be good at craft stuff like that, all right the way the coins move, oh and I didn't spawn the Yoshi coin on screen, that's kind of an issue, you can spawn the Yoshi coin when he trips, oh that's a good idea, yeah, if you go with the tripping, you know what, fuck it, let's make him trip, fine, I'll make him trip, yeah, this code is kind of starting to burn out and I cringe, but that's fine, okay, if the donation TTS doesn't work, then how can I recreate the add Friday Night Funkin video, what, wait, did you just donate, oh you donated to the wrong email address, it's still bugged, great, awesome, you missed my typing sounds and video broadcasts ruined us, right, so let's figure out why this doesn't work, also I feel like, yeah, this was missing, so finish oh wow why isn't doing this um okay this is one thing that i did wrong for sure let's see if he trips at least he does trip in midair with these fucking people on stack overflow i swear to god they want me to give them a minimum reproducible example for this fucking gcc error what do you have an n64 so i can give that to you i told them this is not possible for me that's an unreasonable person like nope you need to do it okay well do you have an n64 do you have the MIPS compiler set up how are you gonna do this you can't do this on a computer because i'm using the fucking fp register and that's the whole issue i have three monitors even yeah clown music very fitting how do i tell this guy to fuck off kindly i mean an example okay how do you want me to do that like that i need the register thing that's like the whole issue that look look at my gcc output here this issue here every time i compile the game i get this issue it's not a real bug it's just a note it gives me i don't know what's this is then kaki i i can look into it later but not right now so something like what i see yeah i'm not programming that so what else you can put yeah i'm not doing that give them the code anyway i need to set up a whole n64 project for them so now the rom doesn't break from that it just gives me a gcc issue but i can name something that doesn't break now they're complaining that they want the code in their hands to like look at the arrow so just disable warnings it doesn't work it's not a warning even if you disable every warning the arrow still shows up or the note just a running code segment how can i do that yoshi i need to set up a project that they can compile right and for that they need a multi-threaded environment because it doesn't work without multi-threading and they need the n64 because they need the fp register in the code so i need to set up a project that compiles an n64 rom that is multi-threaded and that is minimal for that i need to include lib ultra am i supposed to send these guys a lib ultra with like a new n64 project i made how is that gonna fit in here that's completely unreasonable section effect combination results no no no it compiles exactly what i want the issue is that i use the fp register differently in multiple threads and because on one thread it's one value and another it's another it's giving me this note it works perfectly fine but gcc is saying careful but why do you care then because i'm getting this error over and over if i compile my game i get like a hundred of these okay i also want him to turn fast at the beginning um yeah and this still isn't fixed why did this work with o timer but not with all those why i have a sub action that is bizarre isn't it pragma ignore warnings and errors for that specific line it doesn't work it's even worse look i already tried this for the pragma i added the fucking pragma system header and it's still through that it's not a warning right even if i disable every warning it still shows up it is not a warning it's a note which is like a different category apparently so yeah i feel like these guys have no idea what the warning or error or not even means and they just want to waste my time so they don't have to answer my question i'm using the same thing and using different fp for them what vg rep paste message here is that you're saying i should do this  wait does this work uh no it doesn't work it's still there so i don't know what g-ram does i just tried to do what someone in chat told me to do i don't know if i actually did what they asked me to do maybe i can turn this into an f32 like this properly hello buzzer i am doing well that pragma is strict what does that mean so now it works i guess i just can't cast it to the thing in line that's kind of silly so he fell but he didn't fall the way i want i guess if i make him jump less high it kind of work oh also his velocity is doubled i forgot i forgot that makes a lot of sense now yep this might do what we want you're gonna make him tumble over yeah we just need the animation for it so the way it's supposed to work is like okay i'll show you you turn around there's a little jump here then that's him dropping and then just drops the coin and leaves and then you can go collect the coin i think this works we just need the animations now so f compare debug seconds does i'm googling this second time adding ops and i'm gonna do uh compiles twice huh i'll add it to it just because you're telling me to but i don't think this will fix anything no such parlor directory so i need that to my flex here that got rid of this warning does it get rid Of our warnings oh but that's the stumble make me done okay you know what I have a really funny stock overflow post here I will reply thanks all of you for your very kind and helpful words I couldn't ask for better support the issue has been resolved by soft skills guys soft skills soft skills is when you just roll all right I think the stealing guy is finished um considering he's finished now we finished all the five Yoshi coins in this level except the one on top of the Yoshi shit let me look at that one what does blotchy mean is it good or bad there was a dust over there oh I just realized the bug the particles don't de-spawn binaries it's not very nice that's a bad word he called me something bad no way what a rude twitch oh the vertex color oh the vertex colors on this are really dirty and bad oh we gotta fix that as soon as there's so many words when you're trying to reply and say go like if you can make it look good sure but I have serious doubts about that also what about all the animated little hairs you don't like them how do you want to keep those I'm the superstar let's fucking go right the hairs would stay okay yeah I kind of like that if you can make it look good but pretty sure the reason I didn't do that is because I couldn't make it look good so I mean I think Geosphere is a look out of place on Rhystic Survival I haven't tried it yet but I think it would look a little better you are probably right so okay that's so weird from it being a sprite you don't like it oh I made the pokey look so much more pretty I see yeah it's just putting some lighting into the texture can you write the trains throughout the level you can actually I didn't test that you can let's let's test if you actually we should have tested them up at least once dude I really hate that the camera is going the wrong direction when you start the level oh my god that is so annoying let me fix that okay let's try that again it's much better but is the pokey supposed to be clipping through the ceiling and hurting mario what clipping through the ceiling he's clipping through the ceiling so oh I just realized one thing I forgot I forgot to add the trains here huh there is an issue here so I'm pretty sure you can ride the train here and then it will take you to this train station so this is intended but we are missing the train wow oh okay yeah biomech if you look at this level you will see a few issues like this around don't worry about it I'll fix those at the end did the trains add much lag no this area runs really well actually at least I think so um I think the trains should be coming from here going this way uh can i not turn this into a nerf skirt god damn it will the train tracks get any support i don't know can you see all of them while in game they are not all in the same map otherwise depends on your drawing distance it's actually two different kinds of drawing distance the drawing distance on objects for culling and the drawing distance on the rsp for geometry and we're gonna make sure both are right what's canon the protection matrix so because everyone builds this tower in the all level based on a very cool looking very and you send me an image underrepresented architecture style huh is it a toilet better not be a toilet you better not have put the toilet on there the architecture that blade where where is this it wasn't a concept art the toilet it's actually a crime that mario kart 64 did better than diddy kong racing hear me out not because diddy kong racing is a better game but because it was more well made you know what I mean like yeah it's not better it's it's not more fun but like the music's fucking jamming they have their own custom microcode which fucking sucks ass but like they at least tried you know and like you know you know what I mean there's clearly a lot of care put into the game this was the concept yep I remember this yeah I had a lot of cool ideas just a shame the game kinda eh no one wants to play a super skill-based couch multiplayer game I'll be real with you guys no one wants to get smoked by the same friend 50,000 times in a row such a single-player game kinda yeah unless you are that friend even then do you really want to smoke your friends over and over don't you feel like an asshole if you are that much better than your friends at diddy kong racing wouldn't you feel like an asshole asking them to play diddy kong racing with you yeah that's a bad claim and of course music should loop smoothly oh it's too bad biomech we have our triangle would help them get good but why would you want to like put that to an effort getting good at a party game play minecraft with me I will cook you come on okay I'm okay at minecraft when you want to compete in freaking building a tower no I don't want to turn it wait I just realized I forgot to fix the bug I found just now okay guys remind me to fix the bug we just found do not forget very important which is that particles do not despawn when you area transition are you badly luba meeting yeah article despawn timers there we go there is a thing to lock the graphics it's a 2025 title I don't know lock in graphics that's what we are looking for oh in a level is not what we want this does not block between area transitions doesn't need to lock between area transitions I guess it's not that's crazy there we go next time cost 13 yes next stream is definitely gonna be something related to 13 or just a bunch of bug fixes but it's probably not gonna be Chris 12 anymore I'm gonna enter the warp when train appears and then we see if the bug was fixed okay let's fix ah I destroyed this on accident I did it again no fucking way dude this happened before sucks oh well I was gonna have to re-uv map this anyway so it's not that big a deal the reason this is easy to mess up is because I have decals here And when the decals are in the same spot and when you merge by distance in Blender It's just gonna delete the decals and do that to it But the bug was fixed so that's good Next we want to make sure that The train here works fine So Not what we want we want this spline here Nerbs it's just called nerbs quest which Zero and that's 48 or it's 52 48 I Let's see if the trains follow the track as we want Are you sure about this notes thing because there's a lot of messages I'm no longer getting I Mean I could just undo it, but I'm doing it would take longer than just doing it again It wasn't a big change. Just an annoying one to redo Yeah Yeah, I like that in a claim and more levels with the tiny giant mechanic or tight mechanic In my first romech mark 64 madness. I also have stuff that uses the tiny giant mechanic kinda Where are all the trains Still an area to everyone Also, I noticed that some of these are missing the thing here underneath Wait, what sign is this a celebrating good times? Come on Is that the song Did you make it such an order when you get close to the station, nope, the trains are permanently just going Pretty sure someone already made a playable Pepino in Mario 64. I Don't need to team up with anyone and they don't need anyone to team up with them Oh 16 20 24 We have my addiction my six are looking for to bring you roaming sometime anyway, when are you gonna do overwatch porn I'm not Overwatch, you know, I'm not into overwatch. So it's gonna be a while What were your thoughts on James so much like on portal I think he did all the fun parts of building the engine and Then kind of got a setback from valve on top of now having to do all the miserable parts of recreating the content So for him, it was probably just like well This is just an additional kick on my already low morale. Let's just end it Not into overwatch, what is this? I Bet look the only times I ever talk about overwatch is I'm talking if I'm talking about Cheap shaders that people use in their games, you know the shader, you know exactly the shade I'm talking about the sheep glossy one The overwatch porn trainer I See a train on the floor, let's see two trains on the floor Why are they just on the floor Oh But you should paint you to train this on the floor for some reason Oh I see You see this it just spawns over flip over nothing collision my voice so if we do this True to train should arrive Let's see if to Japan arrives I Also also also Wait Wait, where was this DM? This was the funniest thing ever Donna just reminded me of this I Donna sent me this Roblox studio boss children making money on the platform is an exploitation. It's a gift What have I said about child labor and roblox I've been saying this forever Oh My predictions are coming true Roblox makes the big bucks. Yes child labor. That's the winning formula and always has been Okay, there's one train on the tracks now Well, it's kind of off track there, isn't it Yeah It's on track on track and now it goes off track the spline you must be wrong What is that animation you haven't seen that before It's a very fun animation And It seems that this is an issue Gonna buy it for the n64. I wish I could sell n64 games It's too bad I can't if only the law wasn't there to meddle with my affairs I Mean if I move this a little bit inside of the work fun But like that's not this game are gonna go out in five years there's gonna be so many bootleg pads of this I Mean what they should give me an exception. I wish Not playing Mario maker one before it shuts down I haven't even played Mario maker one when it released I Do not like Mario maker Why would I want to play a bunch of bad levels if I haven't even played the good ones yet I Can't be attending them. No, I simply do not care Different gravity and it's a simulation when the train would fall to the ground where strangers follow a path wouldn't make it run faster It is following the path But it also always snaps to the floor I Let me land on the train, please. Thank you Let's see if this follows the tracks better. Oh, that's that's much better There we go I Think we've got it How do you get them mr. Q we're getting ragdolled I tried to recreate the D animation from Mario Kart 64 All right, next question is why are the trains that we plop down just falling down For 8 12 16 20 24 24, this is cool Hmm Yeah, you know the animation Mario Kart 64 where it's just going Yeah, you just cannot fucking flips around that's what I tried to do there I Spent might have to be 52 May I see the jump I can show you the jump and attack on Karonka There's three ways to take lunar parts There are lots of ways that I put like cards. The problem is that a lot of these ways also detect real effort drives I do wanna put some copy protection on against would like hearts on this There is the idea of having a new IPL thing which I'm not even entirely sure what it is But rusky the death of the dragon said that it's gonna help detect a lot of the false cartridges Miss Dono was it sent to my wrong email? It was yeah, something's wrong with my donation thing, but thank you for the free dollars if that was you Yeah, my stream lives is a bit marked because of my PayPal email being a bit messy right now Well, the ethics are doesn't have an SD card But you can get like a cottage that has SD card support and you can like target the cartridge Or something like that Oh beep I'm for multiband by four. Well, I guess we have to the fight the same At the pepper pepper You Yeah, Mario builder uses it hello Arashi Does he want to release an hour? Um, will you show us? Will you show us at least show us getting at one at least serum has been coming huge like a star Can you beat every case of maniac in 14 days, yes That should be pretty doable if you're good on our 64 Something have you hired to play I will hide right Actually a pretty poggy idea Oh There's one star I should be trying anyway, let's get this one star Let's have the proper music on here while we do that Now we're developing true Hey the trains work now Did I just see the dry bones walk off there Well him walking off the sphere because he attacked me but the other one I Guess he just walked off there The lighting looks so good I didn't even do the lighting yet Oh The X here disappeared too because of the Much my distance protected by the dragon I Don't know what you call this in Germany called the schnitzel yacht But the family of cacti Family of cacti the fuck I don't think the sin is up-to-date anymore Where is that the hell I Feel like the cacti don't exist I Wanted to trigger, okay, so this one says with a family of cacti But the cacti don't exist anymore. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add a bunch of pokies there Just because that's the only way we're gonna get cacti here Because you know issues I Don't this might be a little bit cryptic Actors family. I mean it's shit. I'll do that This mission here is very platforming, but you also get to do shortcuts with the pipes, which I think is pretty cool And closed by steel I Like these things these things are fun, but this might be one of the longer missions in the game And It's yet on his face screw real sad that he's only got one rakers right now, it's missing us over 30 I like the stars to the little rainbow. It's so much I All right, all that's missing on the level here now It's a few animations that I'm not making the science that's in us making and then the condition of that I have to make Like the wood needs to make what sounds and stuff like that and some things need to be climbable But I think other than that we're all done Which means I will be seeing you guys next week See ya, bye-bye
