Huuh, come on. Hello, Sleevin. Okay, I see an issue. Hello, Memoski. Papa's Balloon, you're evil. Hello, Sleevin. Who's the real evil one here? You. I programmed it in as a test of morality. Alright. Hello, Dead Ads. Look how happy he is. And he's done. Hello, Matthew Hamill. Alright, this is working as I wanted it to. Whee! It works perfectly. Except for that part. Any OST wishes today before we move on to the overworld? A bug like that is completely irrelevant. Shouldn't you try well, you don't want to try to include bugs on purpose, right? I don't know, it depends on what you mean by bad, really, like, it is a bug for sure, right? And it is arguable that you should not have bugs in your video game. The blue coin incentivizes you even more to pop the balloon. Okay, well, if you steal money from an old grandma, you also get money, but like, do you feel that the government incentivizes you to do those things? Paper Mario ST, let's do it. How about Super Paper Mario ST? I don't think it's a bad thing that you can crash Mario in 39 days when you're playing it. It does help the game's popularity even now. It just feels wrong to on purpose produce bugs. And it also feels wrong to have there be a bug and be like, we want this bug to be there. I imagine had this been caught before the game released, then Nintendo would have patched it out basically. Hello Seymour, it is 2 p.m. of 14.00. Oh, this is the time I stream at every single time I stream. There's some serious lag going on here, holy crap. Holy crap, my game is lagging like crazy. What, what is this lag? This is not normal, what? This is genuinely so uncomfortable to work with, holy shit. I'm not crazy, right? This is like three frames a second. Maybe more than three, but like less than 12. Oh, now it's back to normal, hey. Oh, there's the enemy. Oh, it's pixel blah blah. We have new animations. Oh, and he's making a roller coaster animation, looks very nice.  pixelblahblah has been making a lot of animations for Mario in this game. Man, I kind of really want a new Paper Mario. And I want it with Super Paper Mario gameplay. Because I am not a TTYD fanboy. I always tell people start with a small mod, make something you can finish in like a month at most, maybe like the 10 stars, and then go from there. I'm thinking of making a video about the Missing Links new version, which it does have a new version. Do you guys think it would be interesting for me to talk about the game's design a little bit? Because this game was pretty successful, so I feel like I can talk about the game's design without it being weird. If you make a bad game and then talk about your game's design, that always feels super weird to me. It's like, I don't know, making a pile of trash and then justifying why you made trash, that's what it feels like. But if you made the banger, and then you're like, yeah, this is how I made a banger, that feels good. You know what I mean? Does that make sense? What else is there? I've been feeling super dizzy all day, I think something might be really wrong with me. All right, let's attach Insecto Sheep. Let me see that. I don't see it. Oh, here. Let's see. These are cute ideas, but also, I have to do so much shit to make this work. And I don't know if I want to go through all the pain to do this, especially if you're also at Luigi. That would be like 32 models extra I have to do, and oh my god, that's a lot of work. What's the difference in shader offer? It seems to be. That's kind of nice, I like it. Okay, we have to kind of close the mountains here. Or it's not going to look right. Challenge? As in a 3D modeling challenge for me? Or as in a design challenge for you? Because I am most certainly not looking for a 3D modeling challenge. Okay, good. See, this might be an importance. Okay, challenge. Hmm, I kind of have to close off the background here. Before we can move on with this. I think something like this could look fine. Maybe even like so. That looks cool, I think. I think this will come out very cool. Nice. Then I just marked this forest and then I was like yep, that's good. Dang, okay, this is going to be weird. Especially this section here. But it's unique and that's good, I think. So there's just going to be forest here. And then here it's going to go up into mountains. Damn, is my chat fucking dead today? Did I miss something? Y'all just watching? Is something happening today that I'm missing? Hello LennyLP. I think this would work a bit better if I just put up a wall here. And then the forest can block all that. Like so. Yeah, I wasn't sure if Restream just genuinely stopped showing me in the chat or if just no one was here. So as soon as I make my rounds we have Shantae, Super Paper Mario. It's probably the other way around that Shantae is kind of like Super Paper Mario, cause that's such a big popular franchise. Maybe I should play a Shantae game sometime. Hello Asuko. I think we mostly got this working now. Those are nice rock walls. So I want some weird rainbow cave spirals going inside here, cause I feel like that fits the vibe of Dino Domain super well. Like it goes magical. You know what I mean? It's like, oh magic, we're entering the past. What the hell? Okay, I actually think at this point it's easier to just say fuck it than really doing any of these. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Does it work? It does, and it looks pretty good too. Hello Kenneth, you want to edit videos? Why don't you? Who's stopping you? Hello, Aki Ray. Hello, Dwarf. Welcome to the stream, everyone. I would say this looks pretty nice now. It looks amazing. It's pretty early. The early parts look a lot better than what I'm doing right now. I hope in the end it does look to a point where I'm satisfied with it though. Did I do something really stupid here again? No way, right? No way. I killed this. God damn it. All right, let's do it again. All right. Okay. Hmm. Material 0 to 9. Material 0 to 9? How? I didn't even add a material. Jungle planks. Is it this? Aha. 3D material. Oh, also.  I feel like something should be more colorful to match Yoshi's Island. Hmm. Which trees are we talking about? Are you talking about the flat plane of trees? Because those are definitely going to disappear. They'll just place all up. I'm just autopiloting to go there. Yeah. See, now that the whole world has existed for a little bit, I'm kind of starting to like it. At first I thought it was an open farm, but I think it's only getting decent. It's definitely going to be a lot better once all this stuff is there. I need to do something about this forest though. This forest is really, really bad. I don't like the forest at all. Okay.  This also feels decent. Okay. Let's add the rainbow scroll effect to the cave here. Huh. Okay. I want like this pattern here, but fully rainbow. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.  This could work. I kind of want it going inside. I import them via blender. I have something called the decompilation. Blender lets you add any Python script you want. What you can do is you just model your level and then you export the file with all your stuff. That goes into Mario 64. The fact that blender has scripting capabilities enables all of this.  I can't tell if I'm being stupid right now. There's no way this is going to be seamless if I just take a piece, right?  Yes, this is definitely not seamless. I need to combine two textures for this effect. I have an idea. I have a great idea actually. Hmm. We take this. Flatten it. Rotate it. Scale it to something like 128 by 8. Actually by 1. Why not? So now we can have the rainbow move like this. But then I also want a secondary pattern on it. I wouldn't start with blender tutorials. I would start on page 1 of the blender documentation and just keep going. Until you know everything about my house. Um. I find tutorials to be quite annoying and cumbersome. So, ideally, I would have been jacked a line that goes at an angle. You see the white line here? Surely I can... yeah, okay, it was that simple. Okay, so when this releases, will we come up with more emulators? More than what? We can do a mirroring thing here. Maybe we can't, because we have to rotate this 45 degrees. 27... 83... It's too much, right? Way too much, even. 71... 84... So that's 19... 19... 6 pixels less. Something like that is what we want. We can do something like that, for example, if it's any decent, it should, yeah. 168, so 356. Let's do that. I want exactly 45. There we go. Now this should work, right? Am I wrong about this? I can pick any 64 or 168x68 pattern of this in the Vultures tile. That's what my intuition says. That doesn't look like a tile at all. Fuck. Does it need to be bigger? What do I need for it to tile? These two can tile, no problem. And up and down can tile, no problem, if I go a bit further. Do I just need to repeat the pattern more? What's going on? Here's what I'm making. I'm making a little rainbowish animation. I did not try a 4x4 technique, I don't know what that is. The problem is, I need this 45 degrees rotated before it tiles. And I don't know why this would work. I just have a feeling it would. Hello Newton. I'm live all the time. This is the first time being here. Okay, okay, okay. What should the size be? Shouldn't it be like the square root of 2 multiplied by 64? Is that it? What's that, 90? 90.5? This looks like it will tile, right? Yeah, okay, my intuition was right. Can I make this sharper though? Doesn't this feel wrong kinda? Could it be half of this? Doesn't look right, like it could be half of this. Could it be two thirds of it? Definitely not, no, I think we need this, okay. Cool. This is kind of what I was trying to do. That's not fully there. Why can't 64 on paper Mario come to mind? I'm analyzing Mario 64 to make my Mario 64 mods. I'm not really that interested in analyzing for the sake of analyzing. Hmm. I think the zigzag pattern doesn't look very great. But maybe if we add some transparency to it. I wanted this to be more of a subtle effect anyway.  This sounds like great bake holes from Majora's Mask. And the decon for those games, there is a decon for Mario Kart that just got done. Just recently. But I feel like it's not really published very much about. I actually filed, like I wanted to make a video about it, but then I never ended up doing it. There is a decon for... I don't know if there is one for Mario. Background view, pattern preview. What? That's a thing you can do? Select. There is no background. Hmm. Maybe view? Then pattern preview. That's also not a thing. Man, that sucks. Show extra options? No. Hmm. The Paper Mario one got done like two weeks ago. Hmm. And I was planning to make a video about it. One of the people that worked on it wanted to like help me make a video. Hmm. That doesn't look right. Hmm. Why? Oh, I see. Hmm. I think this is gonna look awesome. Hmm. And I got surprised because I said I still don't understand even after decon. Well, personally, I think I understand all the code now, except like I never read the microcode. But I know Saurin understands the microcode and the audio microcode should be very straightforward. But it's not that everyone understands everything about the codebase. Hmm. But there's no more mysteries left either, I think. Oh, the Paper Mario one was done a while back. Sorry, I misread that. I thought you said the Mario Kart one. Hmm. Yeah, this is what I wanted. Oh, that's cool. Hmm. I'm gonna get to help you more. If you want to help more, for sure. I'm a dominator. Do you think you could make trees later? Trees that fit Yoshi's Island? That would be super cool. Hmm. Abuse me? Alright, I won't abuse you. Do you see these trees? I hate them. These trees suck. Yeah. See, I need trees and I need a forest. And these are actually super important. They need to be really well done. And the thing is, the textures can have a really high resolution. So, for the background trees here, they are actually 128x128, the whole plane of trees here. And the trees in the foreground are 64x64. It should fit into Yoshi's Island, so let's look at Yoshi's Island. I'll do the jungle stuff like... Okay, that's maybe a bit too crazy. Yeah, just think normal trees, I guess. Oh, this is very pretty. Let me get back to admiring my cave, though. I'm really happy with the cave, actually. It really looks like a miracle cave, doesn't it? Beauty. It sucks you right in. Do you have any textures I can reference? I can send you what I used before. I guess there's a problem with the background trees, because the background trees are super curved. And the foreground trees are very flat. Let's see, I used this. I think I can send you that. Um... That file had been sent. We also have stuff like this for the tree trunks, but eh. We got... Honestly, coming up with the tree design is half the work here. Let's see. I think I used something like this before. But those trees just don't look very good. You heard Zayna? Did her voice shine through my microphone? Was she standing behind me and I didn't notice? Hello, Klai? Let's see. That's just Paper Mario. Let's see. I sent them to you, what do you mean? I sent them to you on discord all of them Don't tell me I sent them what do you mean oops You made me think I sent them to the wrong person by accident Oops it's in the word oops I I I don't get it but okay you have fun Man I gotta figure out why the overworld gets so much praise from people I didn't think it looked like especially good but everyone comes in here it's like wow that looks so good Yes yes yes definitely that's what I did right if you look at this there is kind of a low poly tree here I plastered all over the foreground So it needs to be a mix of 2d and 3d trees for sure that's the only way this is gonna look good So What the hell So It's not letting me extrude oh there we go So I think I'll start off mario worlds they haven't really had a proper one since sunshine yeah you know what we also start off zelda dungeons do you remember when the last zelda dungeon was So Sounds about right So Well rmg right now actually can't seem to play my romhack so I can't really recommend rmg And retroarch is kind of always dark shit so I can't recommend retroarch either Um yeah n64 emulation currently is in a pretty terrible state What does mario background pillars with faces called sometimes they go up and down Background pillars penis cells that's what I call them I still have on my list to maybe add a few of those penis cells So Wait mad mario productions is in here mad mario productions dude you're in the game did you know Look at this Yes, we can do two textures at once but they have to be a lower resolution you have to basically share the resolution then You got a plan there mad mario movie We also have season desist and we got wanted yoshi for tax fraud What do you think of this mission that i'm gonna add now you Hit the switch and then you go into this and with the a button you can jump with the roller coaster And you can eject with c I think it does this magic show assault dinosaur Oh, definitely lara that could look very good Honestly, i'm very desperate for this to look good. So any idea you can have like add it The assault dinosaur poster is great Oh that one's missing Dude I love this level. This is probably like thematically my favorite level So Thank you, oh the craft world is basically done And there are some parts left unfinished because we're waiting for Biobak to get to it But so far it's looking pretty good So They actually already finished the world that comes after that which is um space civilization world So The game is actually like pretty close to completion at this point And then I will have my freedom Hmm How many tries are you aiming for the tree well this one is um Six plus six twelve So, yeah, but you can go a bit more than 12, but I think you should try to stay below 18 It's baby yoshi in the sack and baby yoshi is in the sack So Actually, he has a tongue you can use as a grappling hook Why is the sensitivity so all over the place and the directionality too So How It's the next game I don't know I'm making this one, let's maybe So Right, so We we it looks pretty nice Should this just Do this maybe And how does how is this ever going to look fine, I don't know Oh, how do we do this transition? It feels like it doesn't matter what I do it can't be fine Unless I pull the wall way up Or We say fuck it there is mountain here instead of forest You'll develop a non-mario game you're playing the title and playing game you worked on how it looks on steam, uh, yes definitely There's a chance I will turn this into a non-mario game like replace all the mario ip and put it on steam as well Would have some extra features new character new story just like the same levels and objectives mostly It should be legally possible because of the recompilation So Six players honestly, that's probably fine too Depending on how much space they take like if they take up more space then yeah It's just gonna be like that I don't have a heart limit on the try count But also there's a good chance that you'll send it to me and i'll be like, oh, yeah I can see one or two more triangles I can save You Yes, I would be yoshi Just imagine the promotional power of being like Yeah in 2025. No one optimizes their games anymore, but we actually optimized our game so much. It literally runs on a nintendo 64 That's what you sent me Oh Yes, that is nice That's like a foreground tree I think that works pretty well But how's the 16 triangles One count them that's not 16. Oh something's weird's going on here One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve that's 12 triangles She's trying to sneak hidden triangles into my game I knew it Anyway Oh, I have an idea on how this could work What if we do like that move this one over here So You know, you can show the transverse from here since it's been like yes I did But I don't need to they already showed down here Do So Like right away So Foreign These are all the lists for the fresh and absurd talents and we will optimize No, I don't think that's how it works I work in the video game industry I know why games aren't optimized The warrior card thing what's that So So But i'm also not someone who complains that video games are not optimized Just just for information the reason I pointed it out as an our marketing angle is because I know that a lot of people care Give me a plane in the last 10 years. I've been impressed with this optimization. I don't play very many games I have to think about games I played in the last 10 years to begin with I Mean piece of the kingdom's physics engine is pretty cool. That's one thing I can point out that impress me programming wise, I guess When you're trying to make a low poly bar real car a long time ago I wanted to help but I was not sure how to make it back then. All right I remember the bar your car They won't squeeze out all the wrong one Okay, there's a I think there's multiple reasons. So obviously it is uneconomic to optimize a game like you could just Instead of developing one optimized game. You can just develop two games And pretty much everyone is better off for it Um, that's kind of the point of having like stronger machines That you are able to squeeze out games with like less performance optimization That's probably the point of the switch tool because it means devs can make games faster At least that's how I see it um There is the fact that Optimizing is actually like kind of difficult compared to programming in unoptimized ways It is a lot harder to make an optimized game work. Well than it is to make an Optimized game work well because if you want to optimize the game you actually need to be like good at programming whereas if you just want to make a game fucking anyone can do it it's super easy to just make a game so now to make an optimized game you need to hire way more expensive people that are actually like really good at programming unless of course you don't super optimized but just a little bit optimized in my case yeah almost everyone can do it but once you start optimizing there's a lot of crazy things you can do that are not very maintainable that are like you need to really 100% understand the code to be able to touch this so i can't see hello woofoo what kind of floor should we be using here i feel that volcanic rock does not fit at all because we're so far away so let's get a new type of rock here some gravelly type path oh also one big reason for unoptimized games is uh the base engine you're using writing an engine from scratch is very unusual for most people one it's very difficult to do and two it takes really long so they use off-the-shelf engines that are not really tailored to what you want in a game so just through that you're already throwing away like half your performance so what you're going to try to optimize the rest like you can release a game that has 40% of its theoretical best frame rate or you can spend an extra like 10 000 developer hours and get it to 48% but like your engine is so dog shit that the most you can get out of it is like 50% unless you rewrite the whole engine. Is that worth it? Not really. Where's the high I was rushing at? I tried to maintain at least a bit of technician but I couldn't well crunch is definitely also something that will reduce code quality right i'm just saying like even if you work at a relaxed pace you would be made to release multiple games at a relaxed pace instead of one game very fast you worked at a company where they rushed you and they didn't use git I think they're dead jobs over here bro. What? There's no way there is a professional company working without git and if you learn that what no do you not hear what i'm saying even if they gave you enough time to work at the relaxed pace they would not tell you hey spend this little time that we need you to spend on making the game better they would tell you like make more look what you sent me you're over imagining okay no i like this um you can probably remove some of the back tries here but the four triangles is pretty good what I don't know a company that's like programming without git is completely unimaginable is it 55? Yeah it's way too much are you sure this is 55? oh i guess 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 where's the other 25? I guess there could be like two here and some here. Yeah you might have to rotate these slightly that place sounds like it was bound to go down is that place out of business now? How can you be that like inefficiently and terribly managed? I suppose mismanagement could be a real cause for games being kooky too. I actually feel like that's what's going on at Game Freak like extreme mismanagement because the reason i'm saying this is because a lot of Game Freak stuff leaked and they had a lot of really cool animations that leaked that were never implemented in any game that has to be mismanagement like clearly they are people capable of producing cool stuff but it just never makes it into the games so maybe we really should be hating managers more and the people working there less which honestly to me that's unexpected i know everyone's been saying that but you know people say stupid shit like that all the time because that's what feels good to say and not because that's what seems to be true but i think you were right that time oh that looks terrible it was 10 years ago i was pretty dumb i was paid for five hours a day five days on paypal but the workouts was for a two-hour lunch pause that was weird right more beginners or less capitalized mostly so they don't have to pay that much yeah so i know of companies where what they'll do is um um they hire you and then in the contract that says something like you are paid only if our product made this much profit so like you take on a hundred percent of the risk which first off i feel like that should be illegal but also like if you do something like that i'm sure you would have no qualms about hiring complete beginners yeah it sounds like you got completely scammed there so what were you making there with something like that i have to imagine and see we're making a video game because no way else would they find people like to work there right okay so at least you were paid normally right you're on youtube you have a lot of delay shit everything i say you will hear like two minutes later do you know any other developers that went to make their own indie games till that comes to mind art doctor m61 of course toby fox many do i think even brody did i think the game is done now or actually no i don't think the game is done but the demo is out and uh i mean it's pretty normal especially if you've been in the time i definitely think starting with ROM hack is a good idea though because you can get more practice because you get feedback faster and that makes you improve faster so a few people just start out great as a game designer you know i don't know if toby fox made ROM hack first or like how long he's made ROM hack for i would say he's definitely like an exception so send a visual yeah it's a pretty nice tree i like it so are you trying to make trees that fit with the background trees here and then that's what we do it's an automating machine attached to my videos so i have to pay attention for a lot of small things from when you have to use them to database interesting surprising too yeah the tree is nice i like the tree i think we also need a texture with different colors because the colors i use here are terrible they don't fit yoshi's island at all mentions internet seem very good at making sure the game gets enough of their own time and resources but they also make sure everything's really safe slash planned i think that's a curse of there being so much money put into these games the more money you put in the more you have to be absolutely certain that the game will throw a profit no chance for any more dragonflies please i don't understand what are you making that face for tell me when the ad is over well i guess you can't hear me should hire more indie developers like they did with cadence of hyrule did nintendo hire anyone there yo you got a sub and i missed it and anyway i was saying that i don't like the colors of the current backgrounds like this looks poopy and it doesn't look like it fits yoshi's island at all it should be more like caramel chocolate pudding you know what i mean it's like cotton candy it's like sweet the words i'm saying do not make sense for graphics but you understand me right was i missing oh you were not missing anything i'm just saying for if you text chats like that's what i'm looking for  warmer colors maybe that might be a correct word to use so it's just more like walking in cinema popcorn the one's called in yellow yeah just changing the heel no anyway i'm sure laura knows what i mean she draws textures too so i'm not worried i'm not worried at all so there we go i think it's everything he said because i was stuck on an ad so i wasn't sure if i said it looks fine i just said that when you make the colors i don't like the colors we have right now on the reference texture i think they look very bad they need to be sweeter to fit into yoshi's islands so so so mie Oh sorry sometimes they can't on me let's see oh yeah from the sky yeah just a very default one you can kind of see the Yoshi head I feel really really squint what is the image size that really depends on what you do if you want to 16 colors then you can do 64 by 64 if you're fine with if you want gray scale 64 by 64 if you're fine with 16 different colors 64 by 64 the transparent color is part of this if you want more than that 32 by 64 Yeah, I don't think it really matters whether the island is smooshy or from above or not. This is a cute idea, but in the end, who cares. I mean, I'm still trying to get it to be that shape, but only as long as it doesn't impact the gameplay negatively. Alright, let's take a look at what this looks like now. Get a little bit of a feeling for it. Yeah, I kinda like it. And the transition to volcanic rocky looks good too, I think. Nice. Okay. We still need that side of the underground tunnels. Alright, to be honest, I'm feeling pretty exhausted for today. This is the Yoshi huts. Yoshis are gonna be living here. But I'm feeling pretty exhausted for today and I think I'm gonna call it quits early today. I'd like to work a little more in course 7. So, I had hoped we could finish this today, but I don't think we can. Gonna finish this next time and then also start on the underground tunnels. So, until then, bye bye!
