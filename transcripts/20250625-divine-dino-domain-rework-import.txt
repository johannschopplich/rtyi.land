Hello. Okay, there we go. Microphone is working. Hello Nintendo for life. Hello Benjamin Savory. Hello Nicole. Wow, that was bad. Not quite sure why that's happening. Hello SLX. There might be a bad allocate in this playlist comment. Bonjour tout le monde. Whatever that means. Finished importing this area and everything for this area. The coins are funky. Yeah, there's some random loot bleeding somewhere. Look how I made the lighting work on this. And it's working as intended now. It's only the yellow coins for some reason. Those flames are way offset. So I have finished importing all the Divine Dino domain assets, except for this one here, because I was confused on what this does. The Divine is not the right color, but the lighting works. Now, let me check that out. I mentioned what exciting, do you bake it manually or paint it in? Me? I bake it and then I paint over it. What's in game is mostly Biomex work right now. So I wouldn't know. Okay, I clearly did not look at this material because there's a couple of things I don't like here. Oh, you want the light to come from underneath. I can do that. Any OST wishes today? Now the lighting is coming from underneath as intended. The cyan color on this. And I do not like the Benjitori OST. Did he count racing? Honestly, that's a really good one, but it's so short. I've listened to it so many times. There's an issue with these blocks that they come out of the wall sometimes. I think you've shortened them a little bit. Like you've made them the length of the thing in game almost. Happens in the first part of the area too. The Yoshi statue is great. So I actually want to collect all the red coins here once just to make sure it all works fine. Actually, no, I don't because I haven't done the collision map yet. Tropical Freeze? We can do Tropical Freeze OST. Yoshi has a scratch mark on him at all, is that what you're saying? You're moving Pella in the middle now, I see. Well, I see multiple scratch marks. Was it supposed to be one? Oh yeah, I changed the layout. Just having this army of moving bricks is sucky. So I figured if we just reduce it to a couple and put the red coin in the middle, that would be way more fun. I'm still a bit worried about falling into here and then the camera sucks. But I think you can just get out like that. You're supposed to be at the edges. Okay, well, that might be a fast 64 buck. Yep, looks very different in the preview. Hello, son of the Hedge God. Have you seen Biobank's Reworked SSL yet? No, I'm only missing one actor in part, and that's the disco ball. Looks like it was off by two. I mean, it looked like that in-game already, but I just couldn't imagine that being true. Did you do the fat Yoshi? The fat Yoshi? The fat Shy Guy, you mean. Yeah, I did do the fat guy. He is in-game. He does need new animations though, so he's not gonna look correctly right now. Yeah, okay, that's nice. You know, minus the coming out of the wall part. I also really like that you can just go under the bottom now. It's a lot nicer. I need to make sure this plant doesn't clip into the geometry. I'm gonna design him into the Shy Guy. They're really nice, I like them a lot. I actually have one question about one asset that I was working on. It's this one here. What is going on here? Why are there two pillars? There's a short one for the beginning of the backstage area and a short one for the area at the end. Can I just use the same one both times, or will this clip into level geometry? I'm asking because that way I can import less data, which is always nice. Imagine a reference on the bottom. Oh, fine. Do you have the stickers that act as grass overhangs? Oh, you just said that, that's a question. Hello, hello, ultra vibes. Welcome to the stream. What are you working on? The Shy Guy, that's cool. I'm gonna have to program the effect too. Are all the areas in game? I don't think I've seen most of them. Uh, sure. So, we have seen this one here. I don't know if they have been selected. So, I run maybe one beta test a month right now. Usually, whenever I'm working on a level, I run more. I have to currently wait for the last Koopa Carnival tester to be done. And once they are done, I will select a new tester. You will be notified the second you have been selected. But it is very rare that I can actually select someone. Oh, right, this is a bit fresh right now. Oh, they are tongs? That makes a lot of sense, they look like tongs. I just never really thought about it. I've definitely had this work before. Oh, okay, so they only work if you do it right. No, okay, they don't work right now. That's fine. That area isn't finished anyway. Hello, Asko. Protect me, Poochie. Thank you. Protect me, Poochie. Yeah, Mario needs to shift with the animation here. Oh, Poochie, don't go without me. What went wrong with the Big Dose reading? Poochie's path isn't perfect, I realised just now. Did you remove the backface culling on the spikes? I made them so that if you rotate one of them around you, the spikes interlock. I might have removed the backface culling on something? Let me see. No, I have not removed it. Huh. Wait. Was backface culling supposed to be there and I removed it? Or was it not supposed to be there and I added it? Which way around is this wrong? Oh, I see. Yep, I fixed it, I understand now. Okay, the flowers are not a decal. Yeah, so I haven't actually tried to fix every area yet. I'm only trying to get the first of them going. Looks pretty sweet though, doesn't it? Ooh, those are not decals either. Wait, aren't they a two cycle? They need to be two cycle. Come on. Yes! Good thing you mentioned it today. So, just today is the first day that my new merch store is live. I was going to announce this probably on my first channel as well, but there have been some issues. You can only link it to one channel at a time, apparently, so I have to make a second shirt store. But I have partnered with Teespring. They offer much cheaper merch and better margins compared to Spreadshirt. And there's new merch, there's new course icons. So if you guys could check that out. Tell me if anything is wrong with the merch store. Let's see this actually. Pal? Skip ad? No, don't skip ad. Where is it? TPublic, my account, shit, where's my store? Here we go. So we have a few new icons. This one here is obviously very cool. I also like the Wildlife World one. It's cheaper than it was at my old thing. So hopefully it's great. The quality is great too. I like it. So if you could check it out. The thing is, if there's something wrong with it, I want to fix it before I launch this properly on my main account. Might get a few nice. So if you have ideas on how to improve my store, let me know. Because then I can prove it before I link this to my main account. I think they call it a big bone face too. Oh yeah. That's a cutout. Weird. I thought that would have rendered. Can someone link it? I can link it. I should be linking it. Here you go. Yeah, that cutscene is improvable. Can you make it a cutout decal? I'd use Primavera to cut out some unwanted parts. I feel like that's somehow possible. But I'm not sure how. It was possible a while ago, but you can leave it like that and make it a cutout decal pass. I think it is possible. I don't remember how though. Do I need to use text edge? Where's text edge? I mean text edge is right here. Why is it not here? Oops. It is for sure somehow possible. Can I not even get high texture keys on a low poly sphere? Nope. But you should check out the merch. Shockingly, I do not remember how to do it. Do you skip alpha depth sorting or something? There is no alpha depth sorting. It simply renders all the decals after all the transparent things. Alpha depth sorting is way too expensive for such an ancient game. That big apple has no shade, but it has shade alpha. And we compute shade alpha at runtime. We did that on stream. It's stupid, but we needed that for Vertex Colors. I mean, is it really Koopa and Bowser? Are you sure it's not just the turtle? What happens when you look at the fire too closely? Fire? What am I supposed to be seeing wrong? Oops, I got angles. Yes, okay, so if I angle myself like this and I look at that fire, you see how that fire renders in front? So yes, that does break. And then if I go to this fire here. Let's see. This way around renders correctly. And this way around should break. Come on. Yeah. But that is such a minor issue, I don't think people will notice that. I don't think it's a realistic worry we have. What other area do we need to see by the way? Oh, I guess the inside of the temple. So we got this all working as intended. This too. Yeah, I've tried to enter the rave cave, but it wouldn't let me because of a bug. But the rave cave is what we work on next anyway, so it's plenty of that to stream. Move them around. I haven't moved the pillars now. Wait, did you put the pillar objects in here and then I moved them to the side? I might have attached them to the wall. They were in the center. Oh. They make a lot more sense in the center. While I was doing that just now, I was thinking, man, those pillars have an awkward jump at the end. I should put them down. Of course we have this section here, which you've already seen I think. I'll leave it moral. All that's missing now is the rave cave. And then basically this level here has the second pass done. And then I have a huge list of bug fixes to do. Obviously. Meow meow meow meow. Sorry. No, I'm not sorry. I enjoy going meow meow meow. What are you gonna do about it? I think if we had the exact same game but we were allowed to literally just double the entire game's resolution, we would have the same costs. But doubling the resolution is very, very, very expensive. Yeah. So this area, I have not touched it yet. So there are going to be a lot of issues. This looks very cool though. Right, and then we had the whole idea about destroying this thing here. I mean, how much graphics you can elevate regardless of what you can run on the Voodoo 2. Yes. I think we'd be able to have a 480p Mario 64 mech. Well, the N64 cannot output 480p, but we can output 480i. And that's pretty feasible, yes. So we have 442 triangles here. 894. Okay, so this is going to be the new condition we have here. This is swell. 174. Okay, good reduction. You got a Bubble Dome shirt and a Goa'kov mug and hat. Nice! Very, very cool. Let me know what you think once you receive them. Can I see this in my store that someone bought it, actually? I can. Three items were sold. So that was you. Dox me? Okay. Let's find out. No, I'm kidding. You have to remember, there is a chance that we are going to edit things like that. Like the course logos. So you might genuinely get a pre-release shirt. Like, if the course icon changes, then we will never sell the shirt with that icon again. And you would have an exclusive shirt. Wait, this is set to exactly the same. Fuck! I didn't mean to kill that. You already have a pre-release shirt? Dang! That's cool. I don't actually. They like it? That's very good to hear. Oh, you just baked it into the map. Okay, well, I guess we don't need to bake it anymore. Thundercracker redeemed? Oops. You will know our names from Xenoblade 2. That's pretty cool. Yeah, I don't think I need to be a Nazi about the collusion trying to count here. There's a few more we can reduce, but really, who cares. You are really feeling it? Are you feeling it now? Oh, you're feeling the merch? Let's go. The people that make the merch website, they were nice enough to just send me all the stuff for free to test it on. So I do want them to do well, especially because their shop is so much cheaper than Spreadshirt. Can you believe it? The first YouTuber merch that actually looks good? No way. It's a shirt you can actually wear out in public? Holy shit. I do plan on putting the OST for this game on a cartridge and then making a box for the cartridge and then selling the OST with the box. I think that could be really cool. You could have it even with the unreleased bonus songs or unused bonus songs from the game. So you would have bonus songs that no one else can listen to. My YouTube editor keeps telling me, dude, you should get the merch. Look at other tech channels. They make most of their money off merch. You could buy a Lambo soon. And I'm like, I don't want the Lambo. I just want the big automatic lawnmower. I'm an old man, man. I don't need a Lambo. Okay, this is what happens when you use environment color in your materials. How are they not grounded? What? Did I not move them all to the ground just now? What the fuck? Did you advertise my YouTube channel? Did you advertise my YouTube channel? Someone wrote me. Got it. Oh, I see. I don't think it's... Well, look at this. Offload equals minus 800. That would do it. Probably. No. Their shadows are missing. They've never had shadows. And the line of fire, they still need shadows, unfortunately. It looks so bald when they don't have shadows. The shadow's too small. Which is not surprising, because I just guessed it last time. But I can make it very transparent. I think that would look good. Some lighting from the bottom. Yeah, so for lighting in this level, I think what we'll have to do is we have to one, make it from the bottom, and two, change it every frame. Something's wrong with that door. I bet it's using environment color. Let's do it. The actors are not quite positioned right anymore. So, the way it's gonna work is we're gonna have the disco ball attached to this, and Mario's gonna jump on it, and when he jumps on it, the whole disco ball is gonna come crashing to the ground, and everyone's going to look fucking sad. It's gonna be hilarious. I wasn't listening. Am I sad? Oh, never mind. The scaling's completely messed up on the type chest. Which one? Is this what we want? Or this? That looks a lot better. This looks exactly matching now. But is this too small? Are they supposed to be bigger? I think not. Very nice. I feel like I killed all the decals. Did I somehow kill all the decals? Wait, maybe because of the render option. Goddamn! Is it not? Where's all the transparent stuff? Oh, fuck. One is twice too small. This one here? Oh, I see. Okay. I am not sure I understand. Like so? Well, I'm guessing you would want me to move this one here. Is that the intention? Where did all the decals go, though? Hello, Pappy Prinny. They're in a separate model. I think I deleted them, though. On accident, somehow. But I don't know how I would have done that. It's not this. It's not this. It's not this. It's not this, right? Where are they? Decals, no. Okay, so they are gone. Okay, so people were always talking about these Wiseguy decals. So what are they? I think that's the one you want, but what do you need to do for that? Everyone's just saying it, but no one's saying what it is. Like, they've obfuscated the functionality behind the name. Neons and Wonder Transparent Decals, Spotlights, yeah. One of the Spotlights and the Polar Stars is gone, it seems. Now it's messed up in-game. Oh, where? I reported that bug, like, yesterday, I think. No, not yesterday, like, two weeks ago. Let's understand what these two textures are and see if we can fix it. We have two 64x64. No, one 32x32, the other one 64x64. One is twice mirrored. So this should just work. Should it not? It looks like it's slightly offset now, actually. Why is this one mirrored? Is this one supposed to be mirrored? I guess it is. The tiles on this one are supposed to be smaller, so this seems like it should just be correct. Except for the fact that the mirror axis on this one might be wrong. Yeah, look for Daladanzi on fucking Bing. Thank you, Windows 11. Very interesting, but if Luigi was playing with character, how different would your mind Luigi's powers to be? Um, no idea. I still don't exactly know what I want to do with Luigi. So, one thing we could do is just have Luigi run around, and he can interact with things, but things don't really interact with him. The other idea is have Luigi run around, all enemies interact with the plumber closer to them. That should mostly work. But there are going to be some annoying edge cases that are going to be awful to deal with. And then there's also, um, how do you deal with other annoying things. Like, uh, you know, the Raven, but what the fuck is going on? Why is Gimp doing that? Huh? Gimp is here! Oh, Gimp is not fullscreen, that's why. There we go, that looks correct. Uh, well, we have imported Luigi into the game, but we don't really know what to do with him yet. I didn't know I had to add paths to be indexed. Uh, by the way, can you send me the model again, so I can extract the decals and the rays here? Otherwise, I have to get it from the PSR, which actually wouldn't be that much work. Luigi runs like how the Trunks and the Hedge Gimps, but no, he has to be related to Control. Okay, that's a move set for him, but why does he exist? The issue happens before that. I should download the file again, we're just gonna get this from the GitHub. Is this something you're considering? Yes, but there's a lot of considerations for that. If we add split-screen, how do we make split-screen work without being very annoying? Like, how do you deal with the plane section with the Raven boss? With dialogues? How do you deal with dialogues in multiplayer? Like, that's the best question right now. How do you deal with dialogues in two-player mode? We're using Gamecube, then the Boss Fighters module, but the game cuts the use of Gamecube, turning Mario back into a baby, and Luigi pinching him while he's protecting his baby Mario. That's a very random idea. Do you make split-screen before adopt? Yes, and in that split-screen mode, I just removed dialogue. Which was viable, because Mario 64 does not need dialogue to function. This game's different. This game has characters and stuff. That's the problem, it stops the game. Yeah, dialogue has to stop the game, otherwise a bunch of bad things can happen to the talking player. I guess we can just let those things happen. In normal Mario 64 split-screen, every dialogue is instantly skipped and answered with yes. What's this? What's this secret? What's this? What's this? Can I teleport to the other player? I mean, we can do that. We can just stop the entire game, but I feel like that wouldn't be very fun. Also yes, whenever an area transition happens, the other player needs to be teleported. I'm sure he didn't know that I was好. Well, at least it'sgorgeous enough as it is. Oh, this is... it's the same material as my sheet. You're dead. All right, let's take a look. I'm very conscious of how the other controls the camera. True. I think all you need is to be fully experimentative, keeping the Kirby and the forgotten land types multiple as a key, I think. Like, you have to be nearby each other. What would the camera do? It would be split-screen. We're not doing one camera-only player. That just sucks. Yes, the virus game will definitely make a modification for Recomp. We're planning to make, like, a video together or something to get more eyes on Recomp. Whatever. We have DivariOperation, we have FollowEG, we have all your favorites, bro. Do I have a companion on-screen? Yes. Or we could be evil and do it like Donkey Kong 64 where there's a multiplayer mode, but it's like a separate mode and you can't play the game like that. That was fucked up to do to people. Be honest. It should be transparent. Which one? The light blasters? Yeah, that's just a render bug in Blender. Spotlight slash dauntrons. Well, the spotlight has to be transparent and dauntrons needs to be transparent decal. If it's not transparent decal, it's not gonna render. I guess it's matching the coordinates. That's why I duplicated the material. So I could have one transparent and one transparent decal. But it's not fucking rendering at all right now. I'm not sure why. The disco ball is right there, condition-wise. Yeah, but what if there was a Vario operation and you had to fight in the Vario operation and then Freddy Fazbear came out and you had to fight Freddy Fazbear and then Freddy Fazbear came out with the golden Freddy and you had to fight the golden Freddy but you can't look him in the eye because when you look the golden Freddy in the eye, the golden Freddy gets mad and eats you. And Haki Waki is there too, I don't know what that means. Haki Waki from Puppy Playtime? I do not know Puppy Playtime. Period. That's where the sentence ends. And the lame of you, what? I think players would suck it up if multiplayer had some weird jank to it. Otherwise if they were going to play this game multiplayer and just modded themselves to Mario 64 online or something. Yeah, sure, I'm sure that would be super easy. But no, it's not about sucking it up, it's like, if you put stuff in the game you better make sure it's polished. Clean your damn room! It's okay. Don't repeat this exercise. You need to clean your room! I'm bugging out. Why do you want stuff from the game to be from Poland? True. Like the look of this room? Thank you. Violet made it? Thank you too, Nina. Oh, I know the issue. 1000... 105... Super Mario Bros. Mario 64 is the first game in the series to not have a boss that starts with W. Guigla? Pumpkin? No! He knew what he was doing. So now that we have the multiplayer stuff, just have a hard time thinking of the multiplayer you want. Luigi being in one area, Mario being in another. Can't really be written or drawn exactly in the same game. Well, they wouldn't be able to be in separate areas due to RAM constraints, so they would always be in the same area. When one player enters a world, the other player enters it too. But yeah, just having two people play separate halves of the game is not fun at all. Bro, the texture is still fucked up. I can't believe it. Some stuff's recollectable in multiplayer? That sounds like it sucks. Wait, the decal is there, is it not? I see the stars. The stars are here. But the light isn't there. Did I apply the light the wrong way around, maybe? I don't know. Nope, this one's layer 5. Oh, but I didn't apply the layer 6 one. Fucking weird. Wait, did you force no engine into the instant warps and split-screen? Yes. Leela, how else would it work? You think I just keep two areas loaded at the same time? Try doing the opposite UV offset so it looks random, I don't know what I'm doing with my materials. Well, I'm in a completely different render right now, which has a different bug with UVs, so it's different. Yes. Leela, there's no way I'm just gonna add that for no reason. Leela, how would it be fun to just play the game together, but you do completely different stuff? What's the point of playing the game together? You might as well just play the game separately at that point, huh? Okay, so it looks like one of these textures needs to be offset, and it's this one here. What do you think about the main area, what about the little town area, and you could just cover the other layer? I don't know, is that funny? True. What do you think it actually entails? I can select two in three. That could kind of work, yeah. Okay, something is just going wrong here. Why is my material not rendering at all? Let's export this one more time and actually look at the exported data. I don't like New Super Mario Bros. by the way, it's just a mod where you kick the shit out of your friends and nothing else. I'm looking at you Mario 64 DS. Mario 64 DS was a banger though. The multiplayers were the only good part. Do we need the primitive color alpha here? I know that it has a different functionality here compared to the transparent decal layout. Okay, it removed the off... no it didn't. It removed something. Something weird is going on here. Something weird is going on for sure. I think it's worth brainstorming a few more ideas for a multiplayer. Because just running around with two people playing the game separately seems very boring. You don't even interact with each other really if you do that. Unless you force yourself to. Which... eh. People like it, I know. But there has to be something better we can do, right? Some way people help each other. Some way they are maybe forced to be with each other. Maybe a way they compete with each other. Unnecessary sex scenes? Not quite what I was thinking. Compete for coins? That wouldn't be very fun considering you're likely only beating the loud ones. Or you would be getting the same coins over and over. What went wrong here? Why is this removable? Lila, I feel like this might be your fault. Aww. I'm programming something and you're not. No! But you see the issue right now, right? Transparent stuff is not appearing in-game. You can do it right now. You can do it right now. It seems to me like half the object is not rendering. What do you mean? Where do you see objects not rendering? Oh, the floor works now. They no longer feel aligned with the tiles today. They used to be so beautifully aligned with the tiles. I don't like that they're no longer aligned with the tiles. I think this used to be an 8x8 and you made it a 9x9. Let's see if we only render the transparent stuff. Because they don't have a culling area yet, so when they're not directly in-camera, they're not gonna render. I don't know. I feel like I saw a little bit of something. I'm not gonna be able to tell it's from just from the display list. What the hell? I saw a little bit of the thing. Where is it? It's right there, right? It's right there, right? It's right there, right? It exists for one frame and then disappears? Looks like it shows for one frame and then disappears. Huh. You should change the tile pattern on the floor. That's not helpful at all. Unfortunately. I don't know. What's the name of the music playlist? Okay, I need some water. I'll be right back. Maybe I can ask Zena to make me a milkshake and then I can drink a milkshake? Holy fuck, I'll try that. Okay. I'm back. Hi, chat. I just need a bathroom break. Because this child just doesn't nap in her own bed. Here. Here, go back. Go type something to the chat. Hello, baby. Hello. Hello. Hi, chat. It's not a Fast64 bug, Zena? She's grown stronger? She has grown a lot bigger. Hello, da baby. Yeah. I only speak German to her. Please don't type. He said it's not a Fast64 bug. Hmm. Hello? Let's try to render this with full opacity and see what happens. Maybe it's a texture. She's becoming emotive? Yep. She's so cute. Yes. Booba. I think it is anyway. Yeah, if it appears for one frame, it's probably not a Fast64 bug. Let the baby make a level? Sure. Once she's older, she can make a level. Let's test this. No, right now? I don't think she can. She needs a lot more practice. Booba is someone very different in France. Oh no, what does it mean? What is that? Do you like her? Isn't she cool? She's mesmerized by these guys, I think. I think. I should make it so that when you're on the dance floor, the light around Mario lights up. And Mario gets lights on him. I'll put that on my notes. Oh no, oh no. Do you want to play Mario? She's holding the controller. Do you like Mario? She's playing. What are you going to do, Booba? I think she just likes the colorful buttons on the controller. I think so too. Oh, these Shy Guys look cool. I think she likes them. You know what, it's not like all the colors are on screen right now. Like all the disco colors are missing. Yeah, it still needs the flashing. But it looks great. I need to see more of Biobec's rework. I was just busy being stuck because this child was asleep. Oh, she's running. You get the bendy gay straw for gay month today. All right, come here. Come here. Let's let Papa work. Bye, chat. Bye-bye. Booba, say bye-bye. Bye-bye. Can you wave bye-bye? Bye-bye. Bye-bye. All right, I'll go back upstairs and hop on the screen for a bit. Bye, Mimi. Lord, I got a milkshake. Oh yeah, she loves her remote. She has her own remote that she can play with. You know what, this texture being i8 makes no sense anyway. This should be an i8. So I think it's an issue with the texture. Let's fix that up. Don't give batteries to baby. Yeah, we take the batteries out of the remote and give the batteries to the baby. You are exactly right. Don't use the gay straw. Don't do it. It's June. I can use the gay straw. Give the baby Reina. Yeah, we thought it would be funny to do some Luigi, Waluigi bullshit here. Mario, Wario. How do you add a layer like that? Nope, that's a rule. Baby's in love, battery's true. I'm on it. Oh, I see a name Reina too. Baby loves having a remote and I would have done the fucking rounds in 2012 if it's true. Are we going to give up? We have gay baby jail upstairs. There once was a guy. Created something special. He worked so hard. Found a way to get us to the inside. Inside of the virtual. A success for everyone. Until we tried to get out. He wouldn't talk about it. He didn't speak about it. And I was torn about it. I couldn't see another thing about it. I'd say myself about it. He was a thief about it. He swam close to me. And that's all you see. It wasn't me. I wish you were here. So talk, talk, back to the other side. Before I knew about this world. And talk, talk, so dumb when I said it out loud. Babies all look the same until they don't. I say that too, but I'm not allowed to say that actually. It's like the baby looks just like you. Her profile is the same as yours. It's like all babies look the same, man. What are you talking about? Yeah, the baby sometimes just fucking locks in on her Lego. And then she just goes crazy. There once was a guy. There once was a guy. It's still fucked. What the hell? Uh-uh. He found a way to get us to the inside. Uh-uh. Inside of the virtual. A success for everyone. Until we tried to get out. Uh-oh. He wouldn't talk about it. And he didn't speak about it. And I was torn about it. I couldn't see another thing about it. I couldn't see another thing about it. I couldn't see myself about it. It was a thief about it. So I'm close to me. And so you see. It wasn't me. I wish you were me. So talk, talk back to the other side. Let's see what happens now. I don't know about this world. And talk, talk so dumb when I say it. I want to feel like you. We were in the baby pic of Google Images. And right off the bat, you say that's just like you to prove the point. True. So who was all right? Who was all right? Who was all right with you? Yeah, a lot of people tell me she looks just like me. Bro, what the hell is going on? Something with the texture. Somehow the texture is just reading as pure black. I don't know. I don't know. I have very distinctive features that you can get in early. True. True. True. Lila is just a nerd girl phenotype. It's not just your teeth, man. It's not your teeth. I'm just saying you look like the nerd emoji. Wait, isn't there this song? Last Friday Night. Okay, never mind. Never mind. You don't look like that. It's been a year, woman. Where's the nerd girl? Lila. Is Lila. What the fuck is going on here? Why? Why? What did I do? I'm just saying you look like the nerds. Isn't that a good thing to look like a nerd? People told me I look like a jock. And that was worse. Because I googled jock and it was just naked dudes. Thank you, Gemma. Very sick of you. I used to come here more often. You never had a shirt. That's true. Now I have a basement so I can be short for more often. Do you think maybe it's the alpha devil thing? I googled hungover jock, broke pinup and all I got were niggas. Look, I didn't know what a jock was so I googled jock. I'm still not sure what it is. Jock is just like a sports player guy. Okay, why do I get naked dudes when I google sports player guy? Let's compare. Sports player guy. Pictures. We get sports player guy. Jock. Pictures. I can't even show this. The way it starts is already terrible. Something broke. For some reason my combination didn't work just now. That was weird. At least I learned how. People being weird about weird. Okay, the fucking texture doesn't work. I don't understand. Let's check a more accurate graphic plugin. You kinda look like meat spin. Okay, I know what that is. I don't know what that is. There are certain random acts. I don't know what that is. Thank you for updating me on the meat spin lore. I appreciate it. I don't know what that is. I have never heard of Guam though. Wait, isn't that... I feel like I have heard of that actually. Wasn't there a story about bad poop that they found in a country? And the country is named after that? Or the poop is named after that? Because the bad poop was really useful. No, it's not a UV mapping issue. Or maybe it is actually. It doesn't look like it could be one here. What if I check said random act and see what happens. What if I check said random act and see what happens. I get knocked on my door, dressed as a Native American. I would film him. And while I am filming say that this is cultural appropriation. You should take that off. It is very offensive to some people. And then post it on Twitter. Because I am a good person. I am a good person. What if it is like an American military base. And they just give you like a secret address of the American military base. And once you post send it there. They just arrest you for like knowing too much. And it is like a prank. This is still missing. For some reason. Yeah that is not the only thing I am wondering. I don't know. I am finding everything inside of me. I am coming home. I am coming home. Okay nevermind that is not what I am wondering actually. I am coming home. I am coming home. I am coming home. Yeah I can't figure it out. I am coming home. I am coming home. I thought I was tied to something younger. The lies they taught us. But I won't cry so fast now. The darkness never lasts now. And I can't feel change rumbling. So I am coming home. I am finding everything inside of me. I am coming home. I am coming home. I am coming home. I am finding everything inside of me. It is being attached to the average filter is kind of funny. But it shouldn't make a difference. Dude what the fuck? How is this possible? I am coming home. I am coming home. I am coming home. Dude maybe what is going on is like. They just kind of got bored. Yeah right now America is almost at war with Iran. They are sitting on the military base all day. Waiting for like. Do I push the button? Do I push the button? And they are like you know what? Let's just get some Twilight Princess. I am so bored. I can wait for the button to be pressed while I play Twilight Princess. That might just be it. I have heard that like pizza places around the White House can predict crisis early. Because more pizzas are being ordered to the White House. Because people are staying there longer. It might just be that. Bro. Bro I am so out of ideas. How is this possible? What if I just delete all the objects out of this area? What if this is. An actor in the level. Just fucking render modes. Because we didn't reimport over it yet. Nope. Still not it. There is no code running in the game. It has to be a FAST64 bug. I can't take it. I'm drowning and I'll go right back. Out of my head. When angels lie. In the heart of my every time. I'll be burning for you every time. And you'll keep lying. Every time. I was looking at the speedrunning leaderboard. For a game I am playing right now. Need for Speed. And. Fucking on the leaderboard is my co-worker. That's funny. Or my old co-worker. I only work with nerds. I'm not doing this correctly again. And the second time around it just works. Okay. Okay. Doing that proved absolutely nothing. Prime time. Thank you for the prime. When I'm naked in bed with someone else. Nope. This texture looks fine here. But I changed my mind when you wanted that too. Oh no. Not again. I'm sitting in your bed. Looking at your body. Oh no. Here we are. I know that I said it. But boy you must say it. What if we turn the front off. Just see what happens. Do you really want your school to be represented at a Yu-Gi-Oh tournament? I'm kind of a modern Yu-Gi-Oh hater. Not because I think it's repressive that it exists. But because it existing means that old school Yu-Gi-Oh has best players. I think gold from it is fucking awesome. And I hate modern Yu-Gi-Oh. Yeah. Yeah. It's tabling me right all of a sudden. There's just too many rules. And by rules I mean cards. Multiplied by the amount of rules on each card. And by rules I also mean effects. Too much stuff that you have to learn before you can play the game. Yeah I don't like Yu-Gi-Oh rulings either. Like the fact that Pete and the clown can miss timings so easily. Do it. It's stupid. Okay. Okay at this point I don't know what to do. I am baffled by this not working. Nothing here looks wrong to me. What if I said disable clamp team? Just to see what happens. Just for the fun of it. Just to entertain the possibility. Hello Gabonbon. Godzilla exists? I know. I know. But imagine if anything after it didn't exist. The people that play that would be forced to play GOAT. And that would be fucking sick. Basically I wanted to take away your choice of thing so you go back to my choice of thing. But not just that. Because the modern format feels more official. People are biased to play that instead of GOAT. If GOAT format felt like the official format then people would play that one way more. I don't know. Don't play GOAT games because you're not fucking gay. Oh I see the issue. This was the issue all along? Are you fucking kidding me? The texture was scrolling? The texture was scrolling. This whole time. That is so dumb. That is so fucking dumb. Holy shit that is so dumb. The Animal Crossing game will release soon? I don't believe you. Did you pre-order one? Yes I did. Just so I can review it. I think it will be shit. Because they haven't talked to me. I asked can you send me one so I can review it. I can make a review for when it's done. And they didn't do it. The only reason they would not send me one early is because they think their product is dog shit. You're gonna let it go. You're gonna. Up and down, side to side. My body's moving in the need sometimes. To clear my head and let this go. On my back I let it roll. Up and down, side to side. My body's moving in the need this time. To clear my head and let this go. You're gonna let it go. Let this go. What? You're gonna test it with the original console and blue, red or blue tooth adapter? Ah. You're gonna let it go. You're gonna test it with the original console and blue, red or blue tooth adapter? Ah. You're gonna test it with the original console and blue, red or blue tooth adapter? Well we'll see when it comes out. I'm gonna actually check the accuracy and if it truly is 100% compatible like they claim. I feel like I will have a very easy time making stuff not work on it. Let's test it. Why do you want one? I actually don't understand this. Why would anyone want one? Something I never understood. What's the point of having one? Let's test it. Let's test it. You're only gonna always swap out the cams for the hover fail fail one day. Having one replacement would be good for the future. You have emulators. You have emulators. What's the difference between an emulator and a build replacement? Feeling? Yeah, that's my suspicion too. It's purely a feeling difference. What if you got a laptop that automatically boots into an emulator? And then the laptop is only capable of playing that emulator? What if you got a laptop that automatically boots into an emulator? Materialism hardware will always be stuck with its rendering decisions. Emulators won't. Yeah, it's a lot easier to integrate emulators. What do you think about FPGAs? I'm not sure. What was the jump before? I'm not sure. Let's just turn it down until it works. Wait no, we wanna turn it up actually. They're way off set. There's no way the analog 3D should be allowed on the N64 Linux. Unless we literally get to a point where playing without the analog 3D is no longer possible. It has to be banned, yeah. Although you have to think of the comedy potential of not banning it. We will accomplish the end. You remember Siglamick's run on VVC? Like, if you ban it, you're not getting that. I'm not sure. Have you ever switched to NTSC? No. Basically, this was a long time ago. People were speedrunning Mario 64 on N64 and it had like a minute of lag over VVC. And some people were speedrunning it on VVC. And eventually, someone beat the best N64 time with VVC. Which obviously means they were like almost two minutes behind that time. But they became the official world record holder because they played on the faster version. So at the time, the world record holder, what he did is he fucked up the colors on his recording. And he listened to like really annoying boy band music during the entire run. And he basically just first try beat the world record on VVC with like the lowest quality run possible. Just to fuck with everyone. Okay, we reached the left edge. We reached the top edge. Okay. One of the left side. Okay, what if we just make them jump a little further? Yes, I thought it was really funny. Okay. Right, but he became the official world record holder again. And of course he forced the world change that way too. Because, you know, no one wanted to deal with that. Okay, I think we've got the dance going. Wait, they just jumped off the left edge. Did they not? They did. Shit. And they jump off the top edge. Okay. You know, 25% was fine. I think. Okay. But is it fine? Okay. Oh, it has to. Unless we add an upper row of these. Biobank is forcing me to do this. There is no other way. I have to adjust either one. I don't have to adjust both. Well, adjusting the jump length alone wouldn't be enough. Because then they would jump two squares more in each direction. And we needed one extra square. Okay. Do you need one? No? One does two, the other does one. And I need one, so I can just do one. I mean, I could do both if I wanted to reduce the amount of shy guys. Or increase it. Even more. But it's not what I want. Which, it will be perfect. Right after I compile. Okay. See, it's perfect. Disco disco. Now we need to import new versions of deseer. And then we need to program the disco disco. Oh, that's not good that you can do that. I don't like that at all. It's probably a collision radius thing. It's probably not a big deal. Can you skip to the top? I think you can. Dude, it looks so possible. Hello, Samuel. Oh, right, you can't triple jump on stuff like that in this game. It looks so close to being possible. Dang. I'm actually not sure if it's possible now. Damn. And, does my stream look better in VR? Okay. I think I'm just gonna go with one to make my life easier. Okay. Okay. Okay. 201. Okay. The death pit. And this area should be mostly done now. Oh, we still need to program the new disco ball thing. Shit, let me actually get the disco ball collision radius. That looks good at least. 3218. Alright. The cartel changed once to the shiny guy's jump. Possibly. We're still working on figuring that part out. It took so long to get it working? Yeah, because of the stupid light scrolling. We're still missing all the disco lights. Okay, I definitely need to increase the collision radius on this. Alright. So in the end we're gonna have to star in here, and you're gonna just destroy those to ruin their day. Okay. Alright, I think that is all we'll do for today. I'm gonna finish all the lighting and effects in this, probably off stream. And I imagine next stream we'll be back with more overworld streams. So, until next stream. Bye bye!
