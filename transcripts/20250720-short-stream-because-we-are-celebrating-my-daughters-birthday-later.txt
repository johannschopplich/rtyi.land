What kind of answer are you looking for? Whomessicme Well, actually, we will not be overtaking anything from this behavior But actually, we will The coloring area I didn't realize he had an interaction But I guess that makes sense So I found almost half a megabyte of ROM space today Which is very good I did that by deleting all the unused Mario 64 assets that were left in the ROM So That's good Hello, somewaffle So That's okay, it is fantastic I'm very happy about the half a megabyte we found Hello, Timmy We're celebrating her birthday two days before her actual birthday So it's a little early to say happy birthday But it is what the rest of the family wanted So that was from Base Mario 64 Some of Mario's behavior And obviously the Mario model is still based on the Mario model Other than that, I can't think of anything I've been running so many beta tests lately Oh, beta finished this Very nice I gotta watch this later Uh, shit Well, I guess it's fine if you see it It's been on stream anyway Is ASM anywhere in this project? Yeah, there's a little bit of assembly coding in this So I had this level beta tested and stuff There were a lot of little improvements we made all over the game These plants here are one thing They used to be really annoying Now they just come down to your level And the main changes were in the underwater area It's still mostly the same But a lot of it is just easier Like if you look at that, the wooden plank is thicker There's now like coin icons on the walls to help you find the coins Oop, there is more platforms on the ground so you can get out of the water faster This is a lot thicker and slower There's sticks things here Stuff like that There's stuff here to help you get out of the water And I forgot to put this entirely against the wall Let me fix that right now I messed that up Hello Biobank Biobank I think course 2 is almost perfect now I have one beta test video still to watch And then we know it all VS Codium vs VS Code I don't even know if VS Codium is a real thing It sounds like it just made that up Her birthday is on the 21st But they wanted to celebrate it today Hello Michael Angel Alright, why is he not solid? So today, this morning, I spent a good chunk of time deleting all the unused assets from the Mario 64 base game, which saved half a megabyte, and EggLab actually notified me about a decompression algorithm made that's about twice as fast as the standard one. If you look at the standard one right now, it actually takes quite a bit to load. One, two, three. Three seconds of load time, which I think is a little unacceptable. So hopefully with EggLab's decompression, that should go down to about half, which is very exciting. Are you basically deleting that load times? I thought so too, but on Project 64, this is actually fucked up. Let me show this to you. Look at this, Unreal N64 vs. Project 64. N64 is done, Project 64 is done. I think some of my graph render optimizations also kind of slowed down loading time, which makes sense. VS Codium is a FOSS VS Code fork without the Microsoft stuff, like Telemetry, and there's an Aldrith plug-in marketplace. Okay, so you're telling me VS Codium is just VS Code, but without being spied on and more plug-ins. And then you're asking me what I think about the comparison. I mean, it sounds like you pretty much summed it up. Oh, because Submachine is default. 67 stars, sure, whatever, they want 67 stars. All right, next we need to give him a lot of fishing rod, and then make him say, like, ah, this is so relaxing, I'm so glad I'm no longer the king of the Goombas or something. I'll probably just get a fishing pole. Angry, this is my job. Well, actually, this is my... I fucking have three jobs. The first job is programming at Gears for Breakfast, the second job is making YouTube videos, and the third job is, like, making our QAI, I guess. Oh, nice, Biobank. Well, Biobank, once I can finally pay you, which, by the way, we really should be setting that up with Wwise, you can use that to get a whole new computer. Wouldn't that be fucking sick? Actually, if you have such a poverty computer, you might end up with a better PC than me. Here's the parts. Oh, I see. Nice, though. What will be your plan with your custom engine once your mod is done? How about you still use your engine? I'm probably making a whole game with my engine, but also if in the future I make any romhacks, I would probably just space them with my engine. Like, if I was making a Zelda romhack, I would just make a Zelda game in my engine. It would genuinely be easier than dealing with the actual Zelda engine. What should I eat? I don't fucking know, what? Okay. How does a fishing pole look like? Well, I guess we don't need anything too special. Just, like, a hilt? Okay. Give this a little bit of a bench. Okay. I think I'm pretty close to a fishing pole. You cannot talk shit on me on this one. Okay. You're begging for me to block you, but I don't know who you are. Whoops. Eh, well, honestly, my voice is so loud. Well, that's why sometimes you just gotta take the blunt to the face. It's like, I'm gonna fly! Hey, hey, hey, could we get on a flight? Okay. Thank you, D-Time. Are you sure that's a fishing rod? Come on, man! I mean, we could just use this, but this isn't even bent. A fishing rod needs a little bend, right? Okay. That's too low for me. Dang, that looks amazing. Oh, this is perfect. Oh, it's slightly bent on its own, wait. Maybe not as much as this. Okay, fine, I'll just... We'll just restart and we'll actually, like, stay in the plane here to actually do a decent job at it. Yeah, I just need to check, ay, I just want some yen, ay. Thank you guys for tuning in to the sounds of Pinky, a.k.a. NataliaNation, a.k.a. BubblegumFat. How about this, huh? Is that a fishing rod? Can't talk shit now. I think. You thought that was a palm tree? No! Is that a melon? What the fuck is this song? It was better at first. What? I think it's better now. Come on. Sounds like a Goonabane VTuber song. This is what it reminds me of. Hmm. Fair enough, though. Pinky is funny like that. Yo, thank you! I'm sorry, the message hasn't shown up yet, I will thank whoever this was by name in a second. It takes like 5 seconds, 15 seconds, 30 seconds to show up. Yo, ZitaZita! There we go. Dude, I love Pinky's music, though. It's all stupid, but I like it. Oh. Is that Juan? Oh. Same song again. Okay, fine. Let's skip it. Dude, I saw this one Goona VTuber made song on Twitter, and like holy shit it was funny. Speaking of Goonabane, did you guys see Twitter's AI companions? Fucking hilarious. Ah. Ah. Hmm. Hmm. It's boring talking now after 10-15 hours, fair enough. How long would you do it for? Like 3 hours? Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, Elon has really been losing it, you know, recently. After he bought Twitter, like first that video gaming thing, and now he's believing into the Epstein hoax. It's kinda crazy. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, you haven't heard about it? Turns out the Epstein thing was just a hoax. There's so much I'm missing, so much that I'll never say. Somethin' ain't right, I just don't belong here. They look at me crazy, with black clothes and neon hair. I've always felt like I've stood out too much. I'm really tired of this city. Stuck inside this white picket fence. Watching my own life be free. Can't wait no more, so don't look back. Oh wait, is your birthday today, Biobank? No way! Happy birthday, Biobank. Itsu ka, itsu ka yaru wa. Like I'm in an anime. That's on the same move everyday. Will someone take my place? It'd be crazy if it was the exact same thing though. So I'll fly away. Somethin' ain't right, I just can't sit around. In front of the TV, livin' like there's someone else. Kochi ga dame datto, omotte shimau no. Mawari to onaji kodo yaru nai to, nani ga warui no. Stuck inside this white picket fence. Watching my own life be free. Can't wait no more, so don't look back. Oh wait, no more, I won't look back. I'ma make it out this town, one day. I won't be the I want out, one day. Took you to LA, I'm a hero. Did anyone know the music or something? No, you don't like Pinky? Pinky is great. You know what, I'm gonna prove it. Let's find a good Pinky song. How about this one? It runs around where the rot bends. Not sure I understand. It's like my brain, it will never stop. It's okay guys, firebacks will save us. I see you, my cat, shout out 109. You don't hear my line, I just don't have the time. I think I heard a seagull when I hit him with a vine. And she asked if I was on the night shift. I was sleepin' in the back and doin' this shit. The only thing that'll catch me shinin' now is this wrist. If I catch you talkin' funny, I'll be dismissed. I am that kawaii bitch. I'm done with this anime shit. One night and he won't forget. Sugary bubble gum kiss. I'm an American, but I'm also a Colombian. People say I don't speak Japanese. That's too much. And I've been on that Tokyo Drift. All the bitches can't top this shit. This face and this ass. There's no one else like me. There's someone I like. I'll go back to Japan tomorrow. I'm gonna spend so much money in Tokyo this time. My dark wings. Does this sound sad? Why? Okay, now I don't even feel sorry for you anymore. Catch a blue face with a flight. I'm headin' back home. Wake up in the 8 and a little shorty bacon. Roll it up and get the dough. Always hungry, need some mo-to-mo-to. Anata ni nainai. Catch a blue face with a flight. I'm headin' back to Tokyo. Creamy like mommy. Yeah, I keep it poppin'. That soda is so sweet. Mix it with the codeine mix. Okay, if you guys hate this music so much, I am offering you that instead We could listen to GPF. I'm just saying. That's the other option. We could listen to GPF. I'm just saying. That's the other option. What? What? Oh, it's the E button. They're all talking shit about my music. Hello, xDude, awesome. Hello, migolitos. What? Okay, wait. What about... I don't know all these songs. I know this one's famous. The beat's catchy though. The curvy music. Awesome. Just say you hate me. Just say it's personal. What? This should be good, I think. What? Dude, can you believe next week it's F3? It's inching closer and closer. We have, so far, 74 submissions to F3. We have, so far, 74 submissions to F3. Which is fucking crazy. What? Yo, Formula 3 or whatever, dude. Is the song that bad? What's wrong about the song? What's wrong with Pinky? I'm about to put on real VTuber goonabait music. Give you something to cry about. Every year people are like imagine if you put one of your own games into F3, but it's like what would be the point of that? Like why wouldn't I just upload the trailer to my own channel with no context? I would get more views on the trailer that way. Wouldn't that make a lot more sense? Wouldn't that make a lot more sense? Hype moments on Aura? I don't really see it. Oh. Fucking awesome, dude. Love it. Some songs sound better when you kinda listen to them. It's true. Hey! Yeah, this is fun. Being grandpa in like 17 years? True. If I get unlucky even in like 14 years. I take prescriptions to make me feel A-OK I know it's all in my head I have these lucid dreams where I can't feel a thing Thinking of you It's fishing here with the Goomba King. He's done with his minions and just decides to go fishing. Thoughts of a wedding ring Now I'm just better with me I'll do it over again I didn't want it to end I watched it blow in the wind I should've listened to my friends They're shooting the best But I wanted to last You were made out of glass You gave me a heart That was full of mistakes I gave you my heart And you made your heart break Heart break I want to see you I don't want to see you I want to see you Does this make sense? I don't know. Maybe it does make sense. Maybe I'm being stupid You made my heart break You made my heart ache You made my heart break You broke my heart I remember you I remember you How did that happen? How did that happen? Oh, of course that would happen 640 and 192 832 Why is this not I think I'm being stupid This is just not how it works, right? Yeah, that's just not how it works Cool It'll just be It'll just be this for now When fishing on the deck, make more sense Maybe, but he's stupid He's the Goomba King, man Okay We need a hook Okay Actually, what if we just put like a pole there? Might be easier to do Oh You think she'll be into peach? She I think I want a texture of part red and part just white Teardrops could be funneled There'd be swimming pools Filled by models Told that dangerous Is what makes you A whore Don't you have a boy? Nope Was your promise Would you break it If you're honest Told the mirror Would you know she's hurt Before I Don't Wanna Be Young I Don't Wanna Be Young Though She said I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't Wanna Be Young Though I Don't What Do you mean like if I go here Oh Oh Oh, yeah, the clouds catch just didn't have that noise visuals for the longest time It's because I keep reworking the engine. Oh, that's a bug Oh I see. Yes, I think it wasn't resetting Mars by velocity. So maybe that has been an issue. I Don't remember No pen and coke in one minute porkies Anyway moving on to part two Actually before I move on to part two, I want to set the exit pops for this level Because we don't have any right now Behave that for that what goes here looking This way and I think this should be the next thing And then it's been airborne where I'm also goes to your heels at that You know, what wouldn't it be fucking cool if after this level you exited from like really high up Like so And then you're like, oh, yeah, that's cool. That's cool. That's cool. That's cool. Yeah, that's cool That's cool. That's cool. That's cool. That's cool. That's cool Like so Oh my son The song of it didn't show up. All right, let's do it. Oh no Fucking skrillex Can you make the ship Neck not bob through the rainbow as it looks weird along with the shipping skipping into the clouds It could keep it permanently above and move the rainbow down Thank you your ext Be nice and formed up a bit than waves Does it not already do that with the foam layer here Did it fucking crash when I opened the cloud cap So Um That's concerning What the hell Oh What I don't think it could just corrupt the file So Um, i'm not sure what to do I mean obviously I can just Get a backup version of the file but that is still not good Oh, I use eff So This song is such a shit post What an awful song 340 million views Who was listening to this People actually like this No, I I back it up with git Like a normal person Maybe benjamin certified classic. Oh, I see I can't say nothing. Pinky is good. Fuck you. We're listening to more pinky Anytime now Baby People are like oh you need to you need to support independent artists and then you listen to an independent artist and everyone's like Case what the fuck is this? This is not the slop. I usually eat out of my throat What do you mean she makes music that sounds a little different than what i'm used to I I'm not interested key time. I have a backup system. I can just get a backup So Besides I like i'd rather find out why it's not working Thank you dirt star Oh All right, let's see how this works whoops Right, so if we want to exit this level I think our best shot is just collecting the eight reds real quick Because dying takes a while This game Because he saw this meme and look to areas. Alright, let's look at the Skrillex meme. Every ultimate combo looks like this. True! True! Fuck Smash Bros. Ultimate. I actually recently became a Nintendo 3DS hater. The Nintendo 3DS screen looks worse than the Nintendo DS's screen and the 3DS's battery goes for like two hours while the DS goes for like eight or nine hours. So like what the fuck are we doing? How are we going backwards as a society? Oh that's kind of ugly how he clips into the pop-on. That works. We're talking about 10-year-old consoles? True. The old 3DS looks like that last one I know. Well I probably have shit shitty 3DS. But I might also have an old DS so you know, it should balance out. Anyway, we're done with this. Let's move on to part two. So part two. We have the Bowser mech. Okay, we still need to fix the blazing barrel sign. Let's make a little to-do list here. Booetrous. Okay. Have the Bowser mech outside of Bowser's Burst be destroyed and smoking after you beat the first Bowser level. Okay. Okay, start on minecart. Okay, okay. So Booetrous, this, we need the level entrances, the destructing Bowser mech. What else do we need? There's also, there's a Dory chain to a wall in the lake after beating the first Bowser. Yoshi is a Dory spec. When you talk to him, he says you can ride Dory to get up. Ah, okay. Let's make progress here. Okay, we need to think of a marking system here to actually... Hello! So Zayna just came back. So Zayna just came back. What else do we need to do? What else do we need to do? Let's see what's done. The Manta randomly shows up. Yeah, we don't want to do that right now. It was Noroboro. Wait, was it not? Oh, you can see graphs here. Okay, we got that. We don't have that. We have this. Okay, we don't have the Dory. Okay, so we're gonna start on part two next time. But Zayna just came back and I gotta go to the baby's birthday party. That means I will see you guys in the next stream and hopefully by then I will have figured out why the cloud cap stage crashes. Bye-bye!
