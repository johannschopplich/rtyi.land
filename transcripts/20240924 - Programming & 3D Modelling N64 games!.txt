________________________________________________________________________________  Hello Mr.Kamen, did not take you far, a hawk to offend. Hello Leela, I am sorry that it is a work day for you. Hello MinusMario Leela is a wangy truth, your profile picture is literally SubwayKoopa So when I serve my body hit with the heat of the sun, I don't understand. Those are the penis hills from Mario, you often see in Mario games. I think you did learn everything about m64? I mean, I am still learning things, so until last week I guess. What have you been working on? I can show you a few things. So I've changed this area quite a bit, we got a full castle here now, then that castle is gonna be where the toilet is chilling. I changed the starting area a little bit, I still wanna change this, I want this to be less random and more purposeful. Then I started working on thinking about more props for here, I'm thinking the penis hills work well here. Yeah that's fine Lila, as long as the vertex colors match it should not make a difference. Hello douche. I also fixed the styrofoam, what do you think of my new styrofoam? Looks better than before, what do you think? Another thing I really wanna work on today is figuring out a way to make the spin jump less oppressive on the whole game's design as a whole. I think the spin jump is cool, but it's way too strong. Yeah I haven't run Excalibur yet Lila, definitely planned. I also started making some changes in the Egypt area here, I think this is a little more fun platforming-wise, this is gonna be one of those tilting things. Hello Lila BBs. Then there's a waxed cardboard here, which I think that works. Are you using a lot of cardboard right now? I am. But is there an alternative? Cardboard cutout clouds stacking in the background sounds cool. I have puffballs here Zeyna, like fuzzy little cotton balls. Hello Welfare Ninja, I'm glad you like it. Could be made in paper crayon drawings too, true. That would be a bit cheaper and might look better. I was thinking the drawings from Peach's Fury would be nice, but looking at them I don't know about that. Hello Sarah. But yeah one thing I seriously want to think about is a way to make the spin jump not suck. The way it is right now, it is way too broken, like you can climb way too high with it. You can almost climb walls vertically. I noticed that making this tree here, like you can actually just climb the tree, which I don't like, that's too high. Like if you look at this, this is just too powerful I think, or not. It's a little impressive on the rest of the game's design. Cotton, there, cotton clouds. Yeah, I already nerfed it a little bit. I made it so that the initial velocity is less, but mashing A gives you more height. I think it's kind of nice that the impact of each individual A button is more emphasized. Cotton's molecule. Yeah, I'm not really sold on it either. So our mission for today is maybe think about a way to make the spin jump better, which I actually think there's a pretty easy way to do that. Right, I also made it so that the spin jump less, less turning in the air. So I was thinking maybe something like this could be a good decision. Should have missed that comment. Scratches from Super Paper Mario? I don't remember what they look like, but Paper Mario is an apt comparison for this. Like that was almost a high speed stall kick. Oh no, I want it to work like the down B in Smash Bros for sure. Because flicking the control stick, we tried this in enough games, it never works well. Oh, that actually feels a lot nicer. Yeah, now it doesn't really gain you height, but it lets you stall in the air a lot better. I kind of like that. I don't think you can still beat the tutorial in Brawny Bros with this, but oh well. So I also want to think about more things to add to this level here to make the Yoshi Coins work. The first thing, the first way you'll be able to get a Yoshi Coin is like by here. This is going to turn into a trampoline. I removed that piece of geometry there, because I didn't like it. I was thinking another Yoshi Coin. We have to maybe be a little bit cheap with the Yoshi Coins here. Another Yoshi Coin could be here. Hello people, but homemade and by people. Okay, whatever you say. Vincent seems a big uncreative. Yes, I will not disagree with that. Is Marcelo's breakdance move? He does. Did I fix the bug with it? Nope, I did not fix the bug with it. That one I have to actually use this. Double sound when Mario's breakdance happens. Did you guys know that Mario can, you don't know the bug? Look, the bug is when you press B at the last frame of the breakdance animation, he says who, but he doesn't do the animation. I didn't get the bug here, but try again. There. There's also a bug where if you pause right after a long jump and then unpause, you get a high-pitched who or a low-pitched yahoo. But that bug doesn't exist in RTYI, because you can't pause and unpause that fast, because you can always exit course, and I don't want to be able to accidentally do that. Right like that. Right, so maybe I don't need to edit the spin jump, like maybe this is fine. Sure it's a little bit of extra height, but oh well. It's also kind of supposed to be there for like, if you make a mistake, like you can recover it, and like it gives you a little bit of security during jumps, whereas otherwise you might have to just commit to a jump. Not after my changes. Huh? You can't unpause with that? You can. You see that? Tiny bit more horizontal movement. I actually reduced the horizontal movement a good bit, and that's why it's like this right now. I don't know if I wanted to have more horizontal movements. I want this to be a very slow thing, that you kind of like do not want to use, but that gives you a feeling of security when it's available to you. And holding down. Oh, you mean like. Yeah, that's a bit of a problem. You're not wrong. Nope, I don't even like Benjikazooie Eric. Yes, the source will be public. Either way, we have to think about more stuff here. I think the spin jump is fine the way it is. The timing looks different to bounce by, but yeah, because there's a small lock on windows, you don't accidentally exit course. What happened to my toolbar? Where did this go? Wait, what the hell? My vertex painting thing doesn't work anymore. Oh, there we go. Could you make the possible noise cancel out of me, maybe, and you have to use the A button second option? Nope. I don't want to do that. I'm not making changes specifically just so you can back amuse. If you can back amuse, that's a great. I enjoyed it as well, but I'm not going to cater to that. Too gray, almost like dusty cobwebs. They're literally entirely white. They're 100% pure white. Now I don't want her and I don't want them. I'm sorry, maybe, but Zeyna wants to draw in clouds anyway, so I'm attaching them right now. What I am thinking about, though, is more ways to put Yoshi coins in here that are not boring. I'm thinking there could be a Yoshi coin here, maybe. They should probably be on around here. And this is kind of already on the path to the castle, so I don't like that. We don't have much area for the Yoshi coins. One cool idea I had is kind of like a slide through the main mountain here. Put one in the pyramid. That's too far off the main islands to put something there. I kind of like to keep the Yoshi coins in the main area. Although actually on top of here, I would be fine with it. But then I would need to add a way to climb up there. Knock down a wall and a cardboard wall together. I don't know about that. There could be a secret entrance, like a cutout that you can walk into. And then once you walk into it, it just kind of flaps over. I would be fine with that. That is actually kind of a cool idea. Questions, where do we go with that? I also need props to put on here. Really, I need to think about more props that fit Mario's style and can be placed here. And a paper waterfall. A waterfall. We could turn the oasis into a waterfall. Wait, that might be a sick idea. Do we turn the oasis into a waterfall? It's unrealistic and kind of stupid, but I kind of like it. But then what do we fill the oasis with? Because obviously we can't use real water. It has to be like paper somehow. How do we make paper water? Tinsel? What's tinsel? That's way too high poly. Paper waves may eat? True. Blue cellophane. But then you wouldn't be able to go through it. Waterfall. Let's see what people usually do. It's just like glue. Oh, wait. So just like long strips of reflective material. That would be kind of cool. But then if you interact with it, it would feel weird if it didn't move out of the way. I think that's going to be a bit of a problem for me. Hello, Yuri Fairy. The problem with those is that we have to program interaction for those, because without interaction, those are going to look really wrong. Say that name again. Yuri Fairy. No problem. T-shirt material. Now, I think no matter what we do, we're going to run into the issue that either we have to program something that moves out of the way or it's going to be solid. And neither one of those would solve the issue. I also kind of want a different energy. Me. I think a scissor enemy is lame. Scissor enemies don't fit. There should be a different enemy made out of craft stuff. Probably a scissor enemy is that a scissor is not a craft stuff. It's a tool. I think it's not the way I envisioned this to go. Hello, AD Voltec. I am glad you like this. Um, no, we're not referencing anything Nintendo made up for like 1996 or after 2001, whenever the last N64 game released. What are you trying to do? I'm trying to think of more places to put these Yoshi coins. Basically, the Yoshi coins are special interactions that we have in each level. And usually we have a lot of special interactions with like little NPC stuff. The problem is this level doesn't have many NPCs that we can program interactions with. So we need to be creative and come up with things. Push pin? Let's see. No, I want like a creature, not just a thing. For example, we have these thwomps and womps made out of cardboard and we have spindles as well. That's very good. Um, that's how I want this to go. Dust bunny. Oh, I see. If a guy wants a crease and your ground pounces crease. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're thinking the right direction. We can definitely just add as many NPCs made out of paper as we want and have you do very small tasks for them. For example, we don't have a paper peach yet. We have a Yoshi doodle, but you don't really do anything for him. We do have a Toad doodle and he already has a star and we have a Luigi doodle and he already has a star. So I think more doodles wouldn't be so bad. Yeah, Leela, they're called dust bunnies. I think Leela is the right one when she's in a good mood and the left one when she's in a bad mood. I know what you had in mind, Mr. Comet. It was like the pure dirt that builds up. Hello Shane. I'm surprised people are saying the paper level looks good because on my last few videos, people seem to really dislike it. So what other Mario characters are there? There's also Bowser. We can do something with Bowser. We can put a paper Bowser somewhere guarding something. Yes, I have not colored it yet. Obviously, this is a very early version of the level. We started on this like a week or two ago. Shy Guys. Oh yeah, Shy Guys would be perfect. Yeah, we definitely need Shy Guys. Now that I think about this, this is Yoshi's Island. We need Shy Guys. Let's note down ideas here. So Shy Guys. Bowser. And then. Peach. Maybe more. The fuck, yes. I don't want the fuck, I think. Yoshi. Hello, Skyloft. Wii training. Nice. That's good. Shy Guys with stilts. Stilts would be easy to do here. Randall from Yoshi. Sorry, he would also be very cute. But I don't see what he would do with you. Oh. So if we add Bowser to this, I'm thinking Bowser would just be on a long stretch of land and he would just be guarding some Yoshi coin. Kind of like the bridge fight in Super Mario Bros. And it would also just be a cutout that shoots fire at you. So I'm thinking instead of the random ruler here, Bowser would be out in this way or something. Plate Mushroom is great. You know, I'm really glad you recognize that it's a plate. Being able to recognize this is already like half the battle. Yeah, this is what the bridges look. We can make those out of cardboard. And the blocks as well. Actually, this castle here would be perfect. Now that I think about it, there's already a castle that is like a toad captive at the top. What if we have the Bowser fight be like in this direction, in the castle biome? Do you send pictures for character idea? You can send them in this chat if you upload them to anger, I think. I don't think Twitch will stop you or YouTube. No, we don't want this to be a full-on fight. We just want this to be a small interaction. So we're not going to program the whole collapsing thing. Just going to be something like this with a Bowser doodle here. And then a few boxes in between. And the boxes symbolize the bridge. Hello Christian, saw the Styrofoam video, looked awesome. It looks a lot better now than in the video. I have also taken notes that I think we have our first real hater, which is news for me. There's one person disliking every video I upload like two minutes after I upload it. So this is exciting. And after my last video reviewing ChatGPT, we're basically like chat on it the whole time. This person was saying, or there was someone saying, he's just destroying the environment with ChatGPT. And I have a feeling it's this person. And that would be hilarious. Can you stretch violas and reflections from shadows too? Sure. Skelogs. I don't know about Skelogs. I feel like he doesn't care about raw making anymore. I don't know who it was. I just been told about it. It just seems like something a small child would do. The guy also posted a tweet from Ed666slut, which says stop using AI as evidence for the claim. Dude, if 666slut tells me to stop using AI, I would also be very convinced. You do not want to mess with 666slut. Honestly, this first coin here is so uninspired and boring that I do not want that. But I also do not know what to do about it. So this is probably what we'll do for now. I got it to be uploaded. Wait, what the hell is this? I don't know if I want this now. I want something that's like properly craft material stuff. Yeah, that's all I've ever seen those. How much do you have already at the end? I'm keeping any of this in the distance. Yeah, the matrix thing is good. I'm caching the matrix. I'm surprised the compiler didn't do that itself already, because I don't think I used any non-const functions in between. So it should be able to have cached that, but it did not, so it is what it is. Do you like crunching on cardboard? You mean like eating it? The answer is no. I don't like can and big cardboard. I have seen those videos, they are pretty great. I can't say I've done it myself though. Yeah, like that. That's how I want the spin jump to work. Just one of them fall goodnight. I know what you mean. But they are supposed to be like the Bowser boss fight and those don't fall. But it's kind of a big cardboard cutouts. You know those hills with ice in the Mario games? That's what they're supposed to be. I don't know if you're gonna get this before GTA 6. You might. Maybe I should give them eyes too, just so it's more clear what they are. Because if one person is confused, I'm sure more people are going to be confused. And I wanted to avoid having to put a whole decal on top of them, but it is what it is, I guess. So like so. What's that ending? I don't like item carrying missions. Opposite too? No. That's a star request. Oh, okay. Sorry, I didn't see that. Item carrying is just not fun. That's the issue. So maybe don't add white dots to them. No, the eyes are supposed to be what you put on them. I wanted to avoid having to add those triangles. Normal mode for N64? Yep, I can show you real quick. What does it take for me to make Christmas 2013? No idea. I do not think about those things. I just make my game. Coins into paper mining this level? Yes. I have to health more of them. I'll probably add more of them while adding the Yoshi coins. Here's the normal mountain. It's even got a little reflection going. The light is up there if you're wondering. Hello, excellent gamer. Oh yeah, the mushrooms look much better. Can I have the original Mario 64 movement? Mostly. I mean, you can see that there's the spin jump here added, which is the down B from Smash Bros. And there's the dive jump added, which is... Yeah, and there's like 100 old bug fixes with it and all quality of life things. So for example, when you long jump, you can jump still. Normal Mario 64, you cannot jump after a long jump. You get a more consistent speed falloff when you wall kick, like that. In vanilla, you would lose all your speed. Or you have stuff like when you do a frame perfect movement, it spawns little sparkles. So everything just feels a little more consistent and works better. Ideally, as a casual player, you would not notice the difference. Where will be the retro pipe? Right here. And the retro pipe, you will see it when you fly. Because right here, there's going to be a plane launcher here. And there's going to be a paper airplane. And it shoots you off and then you collect silver stars in the air. Will the light ever move? Shouldn't you bake it if it doesn't? The light does not move. And I know what you mean. And I know what you mean by shouldn't you bake it. And after talking to people about what a normal map actually is, because I had the completely wrong impression of what a normal map is. I think I confused it with a bump map or something like that. I found out that what I wanted wasn't actually a normal map. It was... I have no idea what I wanted was. But it is the thing I have now. You guys need to tell me the name of this. So what I'm doing here is... You see how when I turn the camera, the brightness of the pixel changes. And it's trying to change so that when the light angle in matches the light angle out, it is the brightest. The idea is that this is kind of like reflective. And via the normal data, I can compute how much of the light reflection would go into the camera. That's what I'm doing. I don't know the name of it, but I know how to program it. Specular map. I don't know if that's the right word. I never heard specular map before. The wing cam gets used in some places, yes. Let me google specular map. I thought the specular map just computed how reflective each pixel is. Not what the angle of the reflection should be at each pixel. Yeah, I have no idea. Bump mapping. Some kind of weird manual specular slash roughness map. But every roughness and every specular value is the same in everything. I'm doing bump mapping. But this also functions as a normal map. Like it would work with a moving light source. That's the thing. Hello, Divas. You would say that's a normal map? Just a hacky approach to it. I mean, we need a normal map to compute this. Can you show the texture? The texture is a normal map texture. Either way, I want to think about more Yoshi coins. So a peach NPC would work. Having a wrinkle in it? What's your opinion on EPCAT? Pretty nice. You're definitely giving it a good rating. What's TNL? Yes, it will release for free. I never charge for my games. I wouldn't be allowed to. If I was allowed to, maybe I would. Actually, what would I do if I was allowed to charge for this game? Probably release the base game for free and then you could buy a skin or something. If we normal map bump mapping, is bump mapping a bit stronger? Oh, I see, well, we definitely use a normal map then and not bump map. Is a dummy going on? Biobank is almost done, I think. I can't sell cards, MadDog. Okay, so if we do add Peach, we could add like a Peach Rescue Mission, where you get a thing for killing a bunch of Shy Guys. So for that, we would need the Shy Guys. We need the Shy Guys plant. How do paper Shy Guys look like? I definitely do not want to rip the game, the paper Mario enemy. And I also do not want this. I don't know what Anaglyph 3D is. It doesn't replace the star, it's a Yoshi coin. Yeah, that would be the easiest MadDog and I think something like that is what I want to do. Probably just add a platform like here or so, where there's going to be a Peach on it and then a bunch of Shy Guys are just harassing her. Oh, I don't see why it wouldn't be possible to do that. Couldn't you just render two frames of us? Yeah, yeah, I would want the Papercraft enemy. A painted cube like this would obviously be the easiest. No we're not doing the scissor enemy. I said no to that, I changed my mind. Do it on the pyramid platform right now, there's nothing to do here, where? There's all platforming here. Although I guess we could put it here if we want. It'd be fine putting it here. It's also a little bit away from the middle. We want to avoid putting things in the middle as much as possible, because putting things in the middle is going to cause a lot of lag. Okay, but everyone told me the effect I'm doing is not a normal map. Who's wrong now? Oh, this is the remake OST? Let's listen to the original, I want to hear Rogueport. Okay that is a lot better. The original is better Xeroclum, I agree. They're all just remaking the one from Origami King. What the fuck? Bro forgot to drink his milk? The classic ground scene from Super Mario 74? I forgot about that. Hello Steven. I actually think the first award in 74 is not Castle Grounds, because I remember Lackmullod's first YouTube tutorial about how to hack Mario 64. He said you cannot import a custom level over Castle Grounds, because it will bug out. And I don't think he was right, I don't think it was right at the time. But I'm pretty sure he had issues importing over Castle Grounds, making Mario 74. Yeah, that's exactly what we have, Wetnipple. But everyone told me that what I'm doing is not a normal map effect, because I was using it to calculate the light bounce and not anything else. Maybe people thought it wasn't a normal map, because at that point every surface was computed as though the light was coming from directly from the front of the surface. So it just didn't look like a normal map. It's an all-in-one for transform, clipping, and lighting. Didn't give a name on the specific hardware feature. Lighting does reflectivity in the highlights depending on angle. So that's what I'm doing. Some unknown effect that, or some effect that used to be standard but now is completely unknown and I just kind of reinvented that, is that what I did? Well it's not specular, specular sounds like it's determining the specular of each pixel. And diffuse with a big white blob. I can't, actually I can, but I don't want to. I'm trying a new stock tape to popsicle stick and attach to the side. Nope. It's weird without it though, I think it's fine. Can't make out the shape, what? You can easily make out the shape. Do you remember what this looks like, Ava? I can make out the shape pretty well. I don't think you have to focus. It's a natural out of place. Hmm. I don't know, maybe I just have to get back to this in a week or so. Because right now I'm so used to this that it doesn't look weird to me. Maybe I just need to give it a break, you know what I mean? Robot ass level what? And we do 60 on emulator, 30 on N64. It's a target. Okay, what if the crafts, I guess, are just gonna be... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Eh? What the fuck? Isn't that like a finger protector you can wear? That's what I was thinking for the Shy Guys. What if we use one of those with like eyes drawn on? That would be perfect for a Shy Guy. I do not care about the FPGA one bit. I have emulators on a real Nintendo 64. There's no use case for an FPGA. Dimble? The fuck? Yeah, isn't there one made out of pelt here? Hmm. It's usually metal. It could work though, right? It's a Styrofoam look on the N64. I can see if the game boots right now. I can't promise that it will boot this whole level. Let's see. Oh, they're actually using boots. And the framerate is not completely atrocious. This is the 8000 polygon level that we did not optimize yet. Oh, the grass normal mode works. That's good. I thought this was going to run a lot worse. Felt finger puppets? Yeah, yeah, something like that. Oh. That's pretty much the same. Also, the side facing away is darker. You can see that pretty clearly. Shine white blob? Well, when it was not fully white, people were like Case, the Styrofoam is white. You need to make this white. Hello, Nova. Side facing away should be a bit darker. That would be very easy to do. But everyone was saying,   Case, the contrast is too high. I guess I could make this... Well, I mean, I don't have vertex cast yet, so obviously the sides facing away are going to be darker. I don't think I need to change my math for this here. What about the skybox? It's warping because the clip ratio is too small, I think. I think this might need to be subdivided, so it's not as high. I'm surprised how well this runs right now. It really should run as well. A lot of people... Well, I got a few comments on my videos saying that this video and this level looks way too blocky, boring and gaudy. But I think it has to look blocky for the effect to work. And it has to have pretty bright colors. Should I see the vertex coloring? Yeah, of course. It still needs vertex coloring. Well, those might also be the same people that complained about the UV mapping when I haven't UV mapped the level yet. So maybe once it has vertex colored, they will know? I could probably make it less cubical, but the craft would have to change, like the way it's crafted. Right now it's also just like cardboard boxes that I cut out. And I like that. So do we make a thimble, Shiger? Will people even know what a thimble is? Some platform shape variety. Yeah, I could change that. I think most people do. I don't know. I don't think it's a... Well, it's very early on. Alright, so how do we make a thimble then? Probably what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a thimble, I'm going to draw black eyes on it, and I'm going to add brown feet to it, and then hopefully it looks like a Shy Guy. I don't think anyone made a thimble Shy Guy. Huh. Alright, let's try to make one. You might assume they're cops. Yeah, that's honestly good enough for me. Thimble Shy Guy.  Any tips on setting black and white relative to models, overloads, and objects? Nope. Just match QB. That's the only one I use. I expect I would have one way better, and would surprise you more with the actual 0.1 model, not the mini one like last time. But everyone told me that the 0.1 mini model is a lot better. That's why I used that one. I don't think anyone made a thimble Shy Guy.          Thanks for watching! Don't forget to like and subscribe! See you next time! I See Ramona is way better. That's why the use Kevin is a little also like 50 messages a week. Oh Honestly, I have yeah, maybe I should have tried that Finger castle. Yeah, it's called finger hoods in German, which is just the finger hat I Will this be enough to convincingly look like a shy guy If I make this red draw on the mask, well if I put the mask on for sure it will look like one I Don't want to ask that Nicholas, I'll just believe you I think the best thing to do is I just draw a shy guy Stout short you want longer like this I Mean the best I could get a good representation of what this would look like had someone drawn this is probably me drawing it, right? I Don't want them to be symmetrical so I will be drawing both sides separately I There's a yellow part to his belt, too I Think this will look enough like a shy guy Okay, what's the diffuse door tell me what the diffuses Hello Lera, but I'm with anything the shy guy to paint it on shy guy I Didn't mean that you need to it's just one set of phasing away from the light source or darker You only have it on the carpet boxes So you want me to vertex color it which I haven't done yet, yes, I agree I have to vertex color it Obviously, I'm not going to just not vertex color it Well, when you said diffuse I thought you meant like and another texture to it And like multiply the textures or something Which is like no if anything I would make that directly into the normal map or into the palette of the normal map Diffuses baked vertex color. No way I Looks like a cup. Oh It's not supposed to be a cup It's like a beach bucket on sentence Yeah, there I was wrong No, I didn't mirror it on purpose I wanted the sides to look different so it looks more like it's roughly drawn on Hold on case do you know what this is supposed to be? I Think it looks too bad. It's a paper cup shy. I was supposed to be a thimble shy guy I Don't know what this is supposed to be  Don't know what this is supposed to be. I was supposed to be a cardboard one But yeah, I might work person love it it's brilliant Symbols don't have flat tops they don't Right that makes sense I Gotta make it look metallic. Yeah making it metallic is a little bit of a problem Okay, stop I can't I can't just sit here and do nothing I Guess I can think about where the mission would go Well, it's gonna go here I think we know that 10 cushion weights That does sound kind of cute, but I don't want to add the Goomba I'd rather stick to shy guy here I think all shy guys on this level. I'll just shine a set of worms and worms is better All right, let me know when you sent me your message so I can evaluate that He's a really pretty I'm not saying it's good I don't like it either All right. I had to do something though. I can't just sit here and like not try it The problem with some of these ideas is that they're way too high poorly to actually look decent I Case workout anyone want to see me bench 263 pounds Brown feet to make a little bit and brown feet would be the next step But I don't think we've been going there cuz it's not gonna work Five dollar haircut true. I Will probably putting the pitch to little here fuck it Peach noodle rescue that's one guy. Oh, what is this? How he's cute And you for What if the bases were made out of mobile different sized boxes and then the cart layer on top of them was more probably gonna Hang over the saddle and well Yeah, I'm not sure I understand I Mean something we're thinking something like this here Don't need you don't I haven't imported Luigi yet, but it looks pretty nice The base was made out of boxes Hmm I mean, I think this is fun. This is like do I have cardboard anywhere one second I Put it in bones for just so I know where you can move and where you can't All right, so you see how there's like the capital part here the idea is that this is just like a piece of cardboard wrapped around like this and Then on top of the cardboard. There's just held or something put on top And I think we can do that with this And I'm fine with it I'm just not 100% sure wanted yet. And I think before I commit to making any change. I should think about how the Yoshi coins go I mean, I guess I can just make the change fuck it. I guess who cares I will need to review a map that's to get but who cares Something like this is what you want, correct I Should think of it. I know what you mean, but I want this to be pelt. I don't want the top part to be cardboard I So I'm just trying to do something that satisfies less square without changing what the material is You And then the I don't know what you have ideas I only understood one idea I Mean these were different rectangles glued together. There's some variety here Okay, I think I think some upstream is a little bit confused because this is already you've been met some of you seem to think that like Some of the stuff is already like in final state So I guess we can do some of the looks now because the gameplay here is fine. So I'm fine making these changes but I think we're getting a little bit of an overreaction as you always get when you make any changes. Well for the water I don't really have a much better idea right now. I just know I'm gonna cut the water here before the mountains. I don't think having a level being blocky is bad at all. Still would still be very blocky. What the fuck? So this actually reduces the total area of this platform which I think is a good thing. So yeah they were the same because I copy pasted them from blocking it off. I also don't like this thing or these two things. I think they're stupid. Mr. Mouse is your theme. I'm gonna see what music Badoob is gonna come up. Ideally I'm gonna have a music that changes depending on which biome of the level you're in. No, this was before I played Minecraft I have like two and a half hours into Minecraft now Alright, chill I think this jump is too difficult Well, I don't actually know if it's too difficult Like melting molten mountains? Yeah, kinda This won't be where the Petrus mission is I could just put another one of the hills here and then you climb over the hill I think that would look good actually I'm gonna do that Gives you a bit of different sized hills too I don't like that colour Yellow is nice That's 100% the plan, I just haven't done it yet That's the purpose of the sticks, so that you can tilt on it Alright, so we're gonna do Shy Guys We're gonna have a safe beach from Shy Guys The safe was spelled wrong Two more, so ideally this would be with more paper doodles, because the paper doodles are really cute No, we have four times the size And it still performs well There's 88,000 triangles in this level, but it's because of the text Without the text it's 7,500 right now It can't be less square unless we remove the normal map And then I don't know how to make it look good What other NPCs are there? Mario friendly NPC list The most helpful NPCs in Mario games Ghost Poochie, oh Poochie would be great How can we put Poochie in this? Do we want to put Poochie in this? No? Why can't I do? I really do not care about G-spin and I don't know what he's doing Wait, Poochie was in Monstrous Manor Did G-spin even make a hack yet? Which hack did G-spin make? The rhythm one? Why does CTF not exist? Boards Flats, Plessies, Penguins Piñatas? Who autocorrected this one? There are still called Piñatas here Piñatas might be good, bro What game are Galaxy? Who's that? Oh, fuck no We're also not adding anything that was invented after Nintendo 64 unless we invented it ourselves, basically Can't put a robot? I mean, it can be done, but I don't see how that leads to anything What if you added a giant bear? That's just as useful Who else is in Mario 64? Who else is a friend in Mario 64? Dory? Ukiki? Oh, we can definitely have a Ukiki Piñata Dory? Like a Dory you ground pound and it explodes into candy I don't want to add a random Piñata to the game Balloon animals? Oh yeah, pink Bob-ombs! We could definitely add a pink Bob-omb to this We could add a pink Bob-omb that opens a cannon for you and then you can get a Yoshi coin that way somehow There are pictures of newer enemies? I'm pretty sure we swapped those out Because I know exactly what you're talking about and I know I don't want that And I'm pretty sure Biobank swapped those out Yeah, look, they're gone It's these guys now This level is sexy, isn't it? Oh, that's definitely off-center That's also off-center That's also off-center That's also off-center That's also off-center The first mission in this course is to infiltrate the jail and save the other bird Dude, Arthar, 90% of gamblers went right before they went back Alright, I was just part of the 10% today, I couldn't have known Dude, this aquarium is so cool I put so much work into random shit like this, you see how the bubbles sometimes chase each other? Okay, do they ever stop? Please stop chasing each other, thank you How cool is that, the whole thing? Oh my god Make Luber and Sunshine as new? That's fine, that's still like 2001 You could conceive that they were made before, actually no, wasn't there Big Blooper in Paper Mario? Is this TTYD or 64? No, it's 64 Can you send this card protection, all of them? No, that's not a lot of work Can send to the level Oh, but I can't   I'll just upload it Nope, that still exists, I agree, it's a bit awkward though I guess I can try and find the textures real quick Let me see Yeah, this one here is what I use I use this one, I use this There you go Can you send this card protection, all of them? No, that's fine, I agree, it's a bit awkward though My engine is awesome Okay, yeah, I agree, a Bob-omb would be a cool idea The question is, how do we implement that idea without breaking the entire level? A Bob-omb would have to open a cannon, and the cannon would have to shoot somewhere where it can't break the level Yeah, I agree A Bob-omb could also just hide somewhere here, it wouldn't be a big deal for a Yoshi-Kun to be very hidden The cannon should be in the castle section Well, there already is a cannon in the castle section right here But it's not related to a Yoshi-Kun We can also just do another toad that just gifts you a star if you find him Oh, and there's still the cardboard door idea that I like a lot Just a door that you can walk into and it just flips over What do you mean a star? Star? Why are you saying that? Keep in mind, whatever I say, if I don't think it's important, I forget about it within 10 seconds So the toad gives you a star, yep That's a thing in this level I guess here would be a good place for just like a flap It is about a Yoshi-Kun, but there's also a toad that gives you a star So with that we would have two toads What an awful song My left ear is not enjoying this Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-Yoshi What? Flap Cardboard flap So you're just going to flip over the flap and then you can walk through there What is mid-topology? We saved the comedy concept from Paper Mario's Kingdom of Otus How you like, head-butt the toad  Get the switch and send it to the first level somehow Yeah, I don't want to do that All right, yeah, I think if they have a flap here that is like slightly bent you'll easily get the idea of just jumping into it It would be a cool idea, but it's not already planned into the level That we are way too far along So I don't see how that would work out Well, actually It would make sense for the Bowser fight if there was a button here and there was a castle behind him that just kind of dies How does the castle die in the Paper Mario Koopa fight? This one here? Let's look at it real quick That is pretty funny But it doesn't fit the level theme anyway All right, let's see what this is, Layra I don't know what this is   That looks basically the same It's not as cup shaped Yeah, but it doesn't solve the issue of it looking kind of cheap It doesn't really look like a record That's a pretty recognizable thing to me It's a craft one, yeah, but I can't tell what it's made out of If it's symbol it needs to be reflective somehow, I think The cup would be too big in relation to the other items here A cup would be relatively big  I've seen a shot glass If he's made out of glass he would look different too Think we're missing the idea. Paper shot glass. We're getting too specific here. Banana Cat is also pretty good. I hope she's doing well. Look what I sent you. You want him to be made like this. This is like one of those sausage boxes. Wait. Sausage container. No. Sausage container. Did you not have a penguins? Yeah, like this. Should he just be a tomato sauce container with ice drawn on and a mask? It's getting too wild. That's excellent. No, it's not. You missed some bits. What did I miss? Like a bid donation? Let me check stream labs. Do with it what you will. I sent it to you. Yeah, I'm still not 100% sure. Yo, wait. Saburo buy 1,500 bits. Thank you very much. I did miss that. Let me just repeat that alert. How did I miss that? Oh, thank you for letting me know. I almost made a stupid mistake here. There's no sound. Why is there no sound for that? I gotta fix that. What the hell? There's a sound set for it. I don't know why it didn't play. I don't know. That was weird. Trash can shagga that messes on Mrs. Trash can is way too big. What else could you really make a shagga out of though? Headstone. Cause like there aren't many things shaped like them. Yeah. It's not easy being a shy guy. Hello Maggie. Yes, it's the same R64 mod. It's just my own engine. Whether you want to say it's no longer like that's what we're thinking. Bit King symbol. All right. I have an idea with your model you keep. It's a bit of a problem here. I don't think I need detection. Maybe I do. Well, okay. Well, I actually have to make a different text from yours anyway. Cause your text was doing a few things that I wouldn't Oh, what the hell happened here? Oh, that is the thing. Good. Am I blind? Where's Prim? Primitive color. There we go. Transphobia theme song. How is this the theme when they bully the witch girl? He doesn't know the meme. I see. Maybe I shouldn't mirror this after all. Just cause otherwise the resolution is too I like the text on this. They're very cute to me. What the hell? What the hell? How did it only fix one side? Oh, I see. Zero brain cells on the shy guy. What the hell? What the hell? You can make it look thinner. I can, but I don't think that's what I want. Now the second question is, can we somehow make him look more metallic? Is it because 13? Zena is working on it right now. It's not finished. Yes, that's likely what we will have to do, unfortunately. Two sneaky triangles that Layra tried to sneak in here. Can you believe it? I'm also wondering if maybe we should do that. Just to get rid of this row of triangles here. That's 14 triangles down. Sorry, remove this. I think we should just so we can more reasonable and give him that metallic shine. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Maybe the template crayon would also work for a small one. Maybe just more distinct shape and less shiny shape I guess. Yeah. After fluting, what is the fluting? Can I send you a picture? You can send me a picture. You can send it on my Discord. I don't know what kind of picture you would want to send me, though. Okay, wait, I need to check Michi's art on here. Let's check that real quick. This guy's been trying to optimize this function for so long. Okay. Still ain't instruction slower. 15 main courses are planned. Oh my gosh. Does it gonna be from PRing? Wait what? We see a card but you see the holes on an axis. Just a cardboard filing on the other axis. The filling is the folded paper filing. You mean like this part here? How do you think it should work? I mean that's how it would look if you just took a cardboard. Oh I know what you mean. You mean like sometimes it's gonna be like this. If one side has this look and then cut it in half, this side doesn't have that look. I see, I see, I see. You're absolutely right. Making that axis dependent is going to be quite a bit of a challenge though and I don't think I wanna deal with that. Not just because it's a challenge but also because that's just not reasonable to do from like different angles. It's just not gonna look right. I think it's best if the player can just completely avoid thinking about it. You're the first person to think about that so I think that's a very good sign. Yes, of course, I align my stuff to Kerrsteins when I need to. That's a pretty basic trick. Doesn't look very metallic yet if you ask me. Just go for the cup aesthetic. Why not this? Why not have him be a little bit metallic? Wait, what the fuck? That looks crazy. How does it look like this? That's not at all what I had planned. That looks like there's a little guy inside. That is not the effect I expected to see. Caps are too big so... I don't know, something about the shine is off to me still. I don't really like it yet. I think I need a more bumpy shine. What if I had a shine texture and like a bumpy texture on top? I don't like this texture. You have made a cloud? Cloud.plant? Let's see what you got. I see, I see, I see. That is pretty nice, albeit high poly. Is the black part you're supposed to be something? Oh, I think it's because he used an old version of 64. And that's why it didn't show up correct. Ah. It's 69 triangles, which wouldn't be too much. That cloud does look really nice. And I think it might be less polygons, 69 triangles here. How much is one of these clouds? 15. 30. My clouds are 45, yours is 69 here. But I think I can reduce this a little bit. Actually, I don't really see much to reduce. Because it doesn't need a face on the back side. Well, also where it doesn't need a face is the top side. I think about it. Oh, yeah, we're going to see those. No, it would be 49 like this. I think we can go for something like that. Yeah, I like it. I think it's better than the clouds I had. I think I'm going to switch over to these then. But first, I'm going to finish my Shy Guy here. When you take the first thing material here, I think you can use like 16 if you want. But your textures only have to fit into four kilobytes. And every texture would have seven, eight levels. Realistically, what you would use at most is like two textures. Anything more than that would require bitmaps. Yes, they are cotton, but they are going to go. Because they are poopy looking. I didn't even know those bombs are clouds. Exactly my point. That's the issue. Metal grade height map. Or not metal. Metal link. That's not a height map, is it? These are not height maps. There might be a height map in here. Height. There we go. That's what I wanted. There are spindles plants, kind of like that. Did you post that picture on my discord or something? Someone posted a low poly Shy Guy. Not what we want to do, though. You know what? I'm going to do this. This is because I wanted to reduce the amount of repeats, but I didn't want to actually change the texture. Yeah, that was one too much. Oops. Actually, ideally, I would be able to just cut this out completely, but I don't think it's possible. Yeah, that's what I have to do with this pattern. Oh, that looks terrible. Yeah, it's both textures move. It doesn't look like an actual shine on it. It just looks terrible. Cool. Oh, no, it looks a little bit shiny. Why don't you snap good old metal Mario texture onto it? It looks terrible. The question is, does he look enough like a thimble now? Or does it just look like trash? Don't you have a golf ball picture? It's not going to look good either. No. Yes, it will look like this in game. The direction of the highlight is probably going to be a bit different because it's going to depend on the real world sun. But other than that, yes. Golfball texture also wouldn't work because it's also going to move around with everything. Yes, but I wouldn't move with the real world light. Yes, I can make it a sharper transition. But I don't think that solves the issue. We're not doing a bump map on this. They just get the UV map from the camera vector. That's all they do. Hmm. The specular shine isn't small enough. That's fair, yeah. What makes the material have color in that shine? Like how is it colored? It's just set to one. It's just white. But I can set it to shade color or whatever I want. The more metallic, the smaller it is. I see. I mean, I do have smaller shines like this. It still doesn't look like a thimble to me. I'm looking at pictures of thimbles again. Red thimble. Yeah, they have these. I think that's the big deal. These look like they have a lot of friction. And he just doesn't look like he has any friction at all. So what I can do is I can have this be a UV map texture. Where I have one material be the dots and the other material moves around. Or a two cycle texture. Let me see how that works out. How do I find the exact offset without having to go through all the pain again? Can I just count the pixels here? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Looks good to me. What's wrong on both axes or just one of them? Okay. Easy fix. Hey, we did it. Okay. Can you manage somehow? I'm going to do that now. Would multi-tactile do that? Nope. Can you just slice the canvas instead of counting? I don't know how to do that. So all novelty you can use are in camera space? Yes. Oh, it is exactly 64 by 64.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, where this is going on, we don't want the shine to be. And then we want combine color multiplied by text one alpha. Okay, this is, this doesn't look black enough, you know what I mean? Yeah, I'm working on it. I'm actually not sure why they're not black right now. No, it's the opposite of that. I think they should be black right now. They just aren't for some reason. Oh, they are darker, but the transparency is not so high that it would look like that. So, we need the transparency to be bigger when this texture is black. So, maybe we do want this minus texture zero. But with shades, then this plus combines. Doesn't look good either. The good thing about the, oh wait, that's the wrong texture. The good thing about this is that we could move to shine like this. And then now the shine only affects the parts without the bumps. Oh wait, we wanted it like this. Minus texture one alpha. I mean, why is this texture not moving? What the hell? Yeah, I'm just going to assume that some kind of bucket blender, because this should be Yeah, I'm trying to give it a gold, actually maybe a gold texture would be better here. Gold texture. Height map. None of these are height maps. That's not a height map. Maybe this is a height map on the website. Nope. It's just called balls. Maybe if I go for bump map. That kind of looks like what I want. Interesting how this looks. Either way, we don't even need to think about this until we've got this to look right. Oh, it's because we're adding texture one alpha now. Of course, because we're adding combine now. Now we can probably move the highlights around. Yeah, but it still doesn't keep the dark parts dark. Another ball texture with color looks like some kind of brown thing. Don't know what you mean. Too much delay. Unlucky. Yeah, the only way to make these dimples look like they are always there is to have them be a part of the texture below. And that's just UV mapping-wise not possible. Unless we want triple overdraw and we have a whole decal that is just dimples. Why would I randomly want to add more polygons to this Marini? What problem would that solve? I think this is the best we're going to get. I mean, it's not that bad, right? You can tell it's a rough texture from here. Not fun. I don't understand. Making the eyeshade separately was the idea. Oh, the eyes are supposed to be just drawn on. Yeah, I think bumps made out of dots would be the next step if we think the effect is good. I think the effect is good to go then. I'm thinking of trying to use this texture here. See how that works. Because this looks like it has some kind of sphere projection baked in. Which I would like a lot. I don't know. Wait, why are they so big? Yeah, we can't do one that has the projection baked in. Could you add holes on the model where the holes would be? That would be millions of polygons. Any reason not to just use the texture as a bump map instead of laying it over top? We're in the N64, how are you going to make a bump map? Maybe texture can do something here. Nope, texture can does nothing. Maybe textures.com? Nope. This is your texture? Like the texture is the ball? Stupid danger here. A big magnifying glass to concentrate the light in one spot and if you get hit you burn? Well, it's inside a room. If it was outside, yes. Help with golf ball bump map. Golf ball modeling. Bump map, sphere, texture, cool. Golf ball v3. This is version 3? You made 3 versions and it's still not a real texture? What if I just take a hexagonal tile and I make my own texture out of it? Something like this. This is the worst tiling thing I've ever seen. Alright. I like it to be a little bit smooth. Just render and blend. We're not doing this again. It's such a silly thing to do.   Simple texture. I will be able to find something in my folders, I'm very confident. Yes, Imgur links are allowed. Oh, I think YouTube chat might filter that out. YouTube chat has a bit of a stricter rule than Twitch chat. That's unfortunate. I wish I could let people post Imgur links in here, but I guess it doesn't work. Shit. Either way, I was thinking something like this for the texture. Wait, did I do something stupid here? Why does the pattern look so poopy? Reyna knows I'm streaming? That's kinda cute. I don't want to see your Spyro back. Oh, it's because this is... Who made this texture? Hitler? Sorry. Got a little upset. That's better. Yo, thank you for the 10 Euros! Send you a discount. Toilet paper roll? Ah, yes. Like I said, we were planning to... This is a spindle, by the way. I have a no-no. For... I can make it out of a toilet paper roll. I think it's a good idea. I was gonna make it out of cardboard, but toilet paper sounds very fun too. Golf ball texture? That's nice, yes. But I'm gonna go with this one for now. If this doesn't work, I will use your texture. But I think this one will work. I have no clue what this is. Will he make Billy? Oh. That's a real guy in my chat. Willy McBilly. I thought someone was teaching me how to pronounce Willi McBilly. But no, that's just a guy in chat. There, that's perfect, dude. Look at that. Now he's a nice bumpy little fella. Alright, I think we've got our simple guy. Why is this stored under course 1? It should be. It should be course 14. I'm going to delete him from my course 1 files. That's scary. Like his cat foot flip-flops. He'll just be jumping at you, I'm pretty sure. So he's going to be moving around. We've got some hard edges here, which is good. We want all that flat shaded. Alright, I think we got the guy. I think we're good for today. These guys will be harassing the princess peach doodle. And when you beat them, you get a star. Or not a star, you get a Yoshi coin. We still have one more Yoshi coin to plan in this level. But I think for now, we should focus on making the platforming elements. Importing the doodles, getting the stars done. And while we do that, I'm pretty sure we will find another Yoshi coin idea. I think maybe I want some more stuff here, here, here, wherever. But for now, that's good. And I also want to do the clouds. Actually, we don't have any ideas for the level name yet. So if you want to brainstorm that, you can do that too. But you will have to tell me next time we stream. Because for now, I'm going to go offline. Bye!
