Hello? Look who's in chat already, so many people. Isn't that neat? It's a new ROM, heck, half the water level manipulation from World Dry World. Maybe, I mean, I'm not excluding that idea. There's a good chance that would be in the overworld, because the overworld is an island that you like rescue, so it makes sense if water returned over time. It does have water level manipulation in All Alone Bubble Dome, but it's not really looking like the one in World Dry World. Yeah, I'm not authorizing it, nope. That would take a long time to port back, so I have not done it yet. I might do that one day, but that's gonna be far in the future. Arthur simping for me again? Why? What's he doing? Smiley, oh my god, that smiley looks bad. I was thinking of doing that at this game actually, maybe somewhere, I just don't know where. So, we're gonna have a soul bar here, and you can stand on the soul bar and ride it kinda like a Koopa, like a Koopa shell. What the fuck was that? I think the normals are inverted on this or something. What the hell? Why does blood randomly get red when near the screen edge? Blood? Do you mean the Wiggler here? Who's blood? Anonymous Moose came up with this idea already? Well, too bad. See, I have never seen Anon's idea, so that doesn't matter, because that means I didn't steal it. Get him. That is, because that's a test. I was just testing my material to see if my setup of making it redder to make him go angry works. So you're just like in a constant cycle of going red and yellow. The sparkles are weird. Well, you have to somehow know that this is a collectible, and that's usually what Koopa shells do. But yeah, I'm not 100% sold on the sparkles either. Any OST wishes for today? What kind of music are you all in the mood for? It's not Backface Culling. Well, this also has to be moved up a few coordinates, so it's not that big a deal. And actually, I think I would prefer the collision like this, so that if you touch the sides of it, you also get on. So let's try this. Bipolar representation. Make the cellbar a bit bigger to make the player think it's important. No. No, no, no. It's still gonna look like a random asset. Oh yeah, we're also trying to make a new star select screen. Biobak had some pretty cool ideas. I've already experimented a bit with it, but I really don't like what I have so far. Yeah, it looks like Mario's landing on it now. That's all we need. All those dreamy, epic, and well done by an Italian farmer. So this is the new idea for the star select. Basically, each level is gonna have a very small panorama that shows the vibe of the level. This is pretty ugly right now, what I have, but Biobak had a pretty good one. Let me show you what Biobak's idea was. Biobak had this here, which I think works a lot better already. We have Fast64, which is an extension that kind of just exports into Mario64 format. It is pretty helpful here. Can we listen to the Gravity Rush 2 OST? Or Pokemon Delphi? I'm fine with Pokemon Delphi. I don't know Gravity Rush. So I don't want to listen to that. Let's do this. Guess what? What? I don't know.    I like the simple drawings in Biobak's content a lot. I tried a simple drawings version too. Wait, let me show you. Honestly, this is such a vibe, but it just looks terrible. But the vibe is there, you know what I mean? Why not make a 3D rendered background? That's what we're planning to do. It might be better with anti-alias textures instead of hard geo, but that would be a lot of textures. You mean like just an image of textures? The thing is, okay, we have an image of textures. It's going to be 320x240 for each course. That's going to take around 0.3 MB of ROM space, which is a lot. Actually, maybe even more. Maybe like 0.5 MB. I don't like that. That's a lot of space. Plus, it would look as on emulator. Because it's not going to be upscaled. It's just going to look like a blurry lowest JPEG. So if we have a pre-rendered 3D scene, it's going to be cheaper ROM-wise. And it's going to look better on emulator. Just compress it. I'm talking about Compress Lila. Pre-render a higher draw distance background for the stars. Why would I pre-render it? That's just worse than having the 3D model. See, I removed the original mk64 backgrounds. And it saved around 0.3 MB of ROM space. Just for the grass. Two different grass planes. Let's go with a plane. Let's do a parallax effect. I can do that, yeah. That sounds crazy. Compress with image compression. Oh. Yeah. Which one do you use? What's it called? DX4? It's like a 1.8 compression. That wouldn't be so bad. But it still would look terrible. I use Project64. The best emulator on the market. Dude, actually. Wait, let me see if I can talk about this real quick. Okay. I don't know if I'm allowed to say anything. But there is a guy that made a really, really useful tool 20 years ago. And he just wrote me telling me that he's making a new one. And that is super cool. What? What tool? I'm not saying anything. Is Toadstool 20 years old? I thought Toadstool was like 16, 17 years old. I don't know. I think he's older than Yoshi Electron too. What? What does this 0 do here? It's past the city. Okay, that's what I thought. It's Guile's Goddard. Okay. So we have... Do I still have ActWritingShell in here? ActWritingShell. Yep, we do. Okay. Let me just see if this works. If it does, we're all good. Galore. Galore, galore. Why am I lost when I speak French on stream? How do I enable links on stream? Community moderation maybe? Automatic filters. I don't have links disabled. That was an option that said ban links and I did not have it enabled. Okay. So this still works. So we can just reuse this action state. They are disabled. How? I didn't do anything. Okay. That's definitely something we have to fix before release. What's a cell buffer? Washing. You should do that every now and then. No. I'm not going to read that. I scanned the message and it said personalized and I don't want to read it. I'm sorry. Zeyna is actually at work right now and yes, I'm being held hostage. I use 1.6 as in the best Project64 version. The orange fog actually makes this run a lot worse. So we could just remove that. But I think it would look worse without it. What's usually making the shell stick to Mario? Ridden OBJ? There's a Ridden OBJ pointer? What? There's a whole interaction type for this? No way, dude. What? Alright, I guess we use this. How did I not know that? What is this? Is this... Okay, it's a hybrid one. Sigh. How dare you lump in motors with the iceberg? See, Arthur? It's not just me who thinks that. What? Oh, I know what. I know what I did wrong. Having Arthur generate at Mario 64 levels honestly could be very fun. Just stuff like this infinite world. It's still not following Mario. Probably because it's missing the Koopa shell behavior. You guys think we could teach an AI to just make Mario levels forever so you can play an infinite level? Do you think we could teach it to make Brody levels? Because Brody has a very specific style. I feel like AI could emulate that pretty well. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Wait, what? It marks itself for deletion and then sets its action to zero in the original game? That is kinda not good. What are IM thoughts on parallel launcher? I hate using it. Every time I open it there's so many updates. It's so annoying and I can't tell what my ROMs are. I used it like only just two weeks ago to try and make only up work. Or maybe just a week. You guys think there's a new update? In case this is a new issue. If I open parallel launcher right now and there's an update I'm gonna be pissed. Oh! There's two! There's three! It's been a week! It's Okay, it's objectively a good thing that software is being maintained well but it's so annoying. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I  I I I I I I I I I I  I I  I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Putting defines inside functions is evil, well I mean that's why you're gonna use them. See my rule of thumb is usually that any constant that is used more than once is gonna be a define but I also like to put the define like as close as possible to where it's used. Oh no! The big inverted soap. Wait, is backface culling off in this level or something? No it's not. This doesn't look like there's backface culling on this, does it? Hello MarioLuigiSM64. No, it went negative and then it kept growing. Who's hosting F3 this year? Me. He's not gonna be able to ride on you always, Lina. Call it soapiness? It's not soapiness though. Yeah, so you can ride them for a little bit and then they disappear. Okay, maybe not this much time. Oh, it's because we didn't make Mario stop riding. When do you think E3 will return? I don't care. I don't give a shit. Not even a little bit. What should Mario be after what's just running? Bad frog, what? So we got this and then anytime now? There we go. The falling forwards animation when thrown by an enemy, that would also be really funny. I like that. Let's do that. I just realized that you could have gone backwards to make the soap grow and I don't want that. You can't time travel yourself. I'm sorry. This year's F3 will be the best F3 yet. You guys will enjoy it, I think. How many prizes have been submitted for F3? Probably like a hundred. Almost, but I could only take a few. No one submitted SM64 the green comment, unfortunately. How about if you go fast on the soap, you fall forward, otherwise you start walking. I think I like that. I'm a little worried that you can do like star dance cancels with this, but I don't think you can. What is LZ for? Is that better than what I use? I know that there's technically something I could be doing better with compression wise, but I haven't found the N64 source for it. Oh, this is cool. I like this. I'm gonna go slow. Oh, it still happened because I was going too fast. I guess the threshold is pretty low. Yeah. Is that true? Yeah, I'm gonna make the soap smaller, don't worry. Like the threshold has to be smaller than this. I'm wondering if maybe we should just make it compress this way or just like a little bit this way. Like. Does this have to be zero? No, this is two. This is zero. And this is two. It's gonna be 1.5 minus. This. This is what I want. Shouldn't get smaller from the bottom. Yeah. That is also true. That would look funnier. Okay, let's make it smaller from the bottom. But then we also need to offset Mario. Mario does have a variable to offset them. Num keys, of course. What else would it be? I think it should actually be something like this. What? Mem copy is not fast. Decompression is faster than mem copy sometimes. I just fucked up. Oh, now we're getting negative soap. Yeah. Okay, it's not going down the way I want though. Okay. No, it should go down more and more. Let's try this. Negative soap makes it only true. Yeah, better. There is a new donation link in the description of the stream that I think should work. I tried to fix it again. True, a define totally would have saved me. It's now in the floor. Okay, that mostly works. Yeah. It's a bit too far down. And Mario's vertical offset does not really seem to work. Probably because it's being reset somewhere. This is also divided by two.  There is a reason for the monkeys thing. Don't worry about it. Yeah, submarine. I just have to make sure it's being reset to zero afterwards. Yeah, if you have a bathroom in one of your games, you have the perfect item. True. Guys, do you actually use like a bar of soap? Fire L. This doesn't make any sense. It should go further and further down. The graph was that why not be done the way I think it should be. A big girly type of strawberry body gel for me. Did I just use the three and one that you use in the shower? Better donated. Thank you for the gingers. That's so bad for you. Oh no, my hair. No song. Why is there no song? Are you gaslighting me? You're gaslighting me. There's no way there's no song with this. He's gaslighting me, guys. I'm pretty sure. But I am going to log in just to make sure. Where would you see this? Tipping in the media share. No, there was a song. What? How can I not see it? Dude, I suck at using stream maps. Is it in the recent events? I'm playing it. It even said that you shared the song. I don't know why it's not playing. Oh, I need to accept it. I just accepted it. Does it not play? I don't know what. Okay, we're going to go back to figuring this out after the stream. I expected this again. So the thing is, the soap bar is like in the middle. So when you squeeze it to zero, the graph offset should go to zero from 15. But it didn't seem to move at all. And also Mario doesn't seem to move. Let's just try M keys equals 200. Just like as a broad statement, see what happens. Might be getting reset again. So I'm playing it manually. Okay. Oh, by the way, over the week, I fixed all the bugs we found in OnlyUp64. Some people are making fun of me for not being able to ledge grab. Look at that. You can ledge grab. What a fucking technology. Insane. Oh, wait, it's like minus 127. Also, also, and this is actually cool. This is something that you couldn't do in Mario 64. In Mario 64 on a wall like this, you can't jump on it. You will get rejected from it. But I fixed that. So now walls like this consistently just work. That is super cool, isn't it? But that also means you can kick up those walls. Okay. I still have some stuff to do. Okay. I think there is a tech instruction somewhere being hit. Didn't even make a note of the crash. L will happen again. I can just remember. No, I'm not recreating OnlyUp64. I don't like going back and updating shit. Hmm. Could it be that the numkeys variable doesn't work anymore? That's not too unlikely, actually. Or it could be that the act writing shell just doesn't take that param in. Yeah, it just updates Mario's GFX while I perform ground step. That would make sense. And I think numkeys, where is this being done? Oh, it's an Xignore action. Never mind. Hmm. Hmm. I can just get on X and Y during the last 10 times so you can tell when it's about to disappear. Seems reasonable, yeah? Hmm. Adding location movements to my bones in the future? No. Hmm. Hmm. I don't think there's anything else updating the numkeys variable, but just to be safe. I also don't like this. The down offset needs to get more as the thing gets bigger, so let's try this, I guess. The big shy guy? It has a big shy guy. Are they only in the Game Boy Advance remake? I did not know that. Dude, people were like, oh, okay, so you need console printing, it's so useful. Bitch, have you ever heard of print text FMT in 2020? Okay, that seems to work. I think the starting offset is a bit too high, but this is good. So yeah, the numkeys variable clearly doesn't work. And I'll be honest, I think it's not a very good variable anyway. Is it just that this doesn't work at all, like the entire concept is just not great? Yeah, look, if I just increase Mario's position, nothing happens. Interesting. Oh, I know why, I know why. Oh, it's because I synced the camera movement to Mario's update. Let me just find the function. Oh, it was right here. Yeah, right here is where Mario gets updated. But... Let me remove my debug thing here. Hello, migolito. Okay, this seems to work pretty well. I am inside your walls. Okay. Okay, I have one fear with this and that is if you exit course while you're on it, it's just going to carry over. If you could invent a new unit of measurement, what would it measure and what would it be called? Can it just be like a magical unit that measures something that's not really measurable? Sure, okay, then the unit, I'm naming it, I'm naming it goodness and it measures how good the thing is. It's called goodness? Yeah, but there's like no way to actually measure goodness. See, he gave me a magical unit that can do that. Like you gave me that option, Beta, you only have yourself to blame here. Goodness would be such a good measurement. It would have like a goodness of like a hundred to just have the goodness as a measurement. Goodness is already used by British people when they say, my goodness, copyright strike on you. I'm just going to be copyright striked by the UK into milli goodness and kilo goodness. But like, what's a bad thing? Would a bad thing have a goodness of zero or would it be like negative goodness? I think it would have negative goodness. Actually, I'm the one inventing the unit, so I get to decide that. Oh, okay. Keys are being reset, so we're all good. Like temperature? Okay, but no, no, no, no, no, no. Like temperature? Temperature doesn't, okay, temperature doesn't really go negative, right? Temperature just stops existing. There's not really negative temperature. Like if you go by Kelvins, it starts at zero because that's where matter stops moving. You can't go just negative and negative. And you actually model which program I do this VS code and blender mostly. Okay, let's make up a soap trail. What could it look like? We could make bubbles that just kind of go up. I think that would look really good. We should have some of those. Let's make a bubble particle. We already have some bubble materials here. Where's your soap? Typical gamer moment. Dude, guys, I have to show you something. I found a new achievement today. This is the first time this happened to me. I as a male have gotten a rape threat. That's insane. That's never happened to me before. This is like so rare to get that. Like death threats? Shoot, everyone's gotten some of those. But rape threats as a guy? What the fuck? I don't know this guy. This was the first message this guy ever sent me. And then he blocked me. Bubble particles are such a huge shiny particle that a soap goes because it is clean. True shiny particles. That's a good idea. Maybe you should read some philosophy, true. I think I'm making my own bubble particle, so it works with my render settings. Right here. You can hear what Alec Rigg's philosophy case is. Eat sea urchins. I don't think that guy even knows about the PC port. He was talking about philosophy. I don't even know what I said about philosophy to prompt that response. Is this how philosophy people think? I think model pebble is pretty good as a base here. Okay, so we probably have a bubble texture somewhere. Maybe he said it was a fake science. No, I mean, I probably said I think it's stupid. Philosophy is kind of stupid. I don't think even the worst philosopher deserves this response. I mean, I don't know. Maybe the man's just very passionate. He does type like a 12 year old though. I feel like the vibe I'm getting from that message is that it's like, it's just like a little kid. Maybe it's like 14 or 15 even, and he thinks he's like super special because he's into philosophy and like he really identifies with the idea of being a philosopher and like a smart dude and better than his classmates. Even though they're probably, you know, they don't like him because he's being the weird dude that's just trying to make himself look better than the others. And then when he hears someone's shit on philosophy, he just loses it. He goes off the rails. Although I don't even know what I said. Maybe I just disagreed with him on something. Maybe he watched the stream and was like, man, fuck this guy. I feel like there's not going to be any bubbles in here. Yeah. What if we look into the Mario 64 HD textures and see if we find a bubble texture in there? I think the kind of person who lives in a cave and watches shadows of the real world on the wall to be honest. Me? Okay. Who can speak? I was going to call this French, but I can't go with the bit. I can't pretend this is French. Sure. Yeah, that's what I'm hoping to just make it sparkle a little bit.  You know what? These textures are going to be awful. No matter what. Why am I even looking at those? I feel like my best bet is to just look at the actual Mario 64 bubble textures here. I think this is going to work.  Fucking Netzwerk? What's wrong with Netzwerk? Why is my man hating on Netzwerk? Give it a pinkie. Agreed. Yeah, let's just give it a pinkie right now in GIMP. German has to be made up. What's wrong with Netzwerk? Netz as in net? And Werk as in work? Network? I mean. Sir, if the phone stunk and blew up, your navigation wasn't thinking about that when I added you. Oh, I didn't even notice. Hello, Clayman. It's been a while. No, my stories don't connect when I make remakes. Making your story connected to your other fan games that probably a lot of people that play this new fan game haven't played. It's just kind of bad if you ask me. Rache shows up with this one. No. Oh. What are the law implications? Both are wanting to capture the Yoshis. There aren't any? What do you mean? He just likes free labor. Is there a robot cinematic universe? Are you serious? No way. He wouldn't do that. Robot's a goofy dude, but like that's too far. He wouldn't do that. It does sound like a robot thing. Actually, yeah. You mean you don't want to play Star Wars 1 through 17.5 to understand why giant brother the second inverted dogs Easter well with reverse gamma. This is too accurate. Bro has played all the Star Revenge games. That's all he knows. Same ones, but the main ones aren't even the ones you would want to play. Isn't there also like important lore in like the 6.9 and 15.7 games? Actually, he doesn't go above nine. That's what he said. How do I patch the ROM? Where should I put this? Where did I put like the other ones? Actress water wave modeling. Model the thing. Missed. You know what? There's no way I can ever overwrite this file anyway. So let's just put this here. Wait, this is exclusive to one level. It should be in that level. It's false. I changed my mind. I'm genuinely shocked that people are still laughing at 426. It's like the bottom of the barrel of comedy. I've been hating on these for a while. Yes. This is the most you'll ever get out of comments from me. I probably have particles that are already more accurate to what I want. Can I contribute to your code base? How do you want to do that? Actually, I think your mom jokes are fine. Your mom jokes is like a different brand of comedy. Like Ligma jokes. I think we can all agree that Ligma jokes are kind of funny. Your mom jokes is like that, but like it's older than that. Maybe right now people are hating on it a bit because it seems like a boomer thing. But I think a few years from now people will be having fond memories of your mom jokes. I would add comments. Oh, I don't need comments. When you say these nuts jokes are in the Ligma family or in their own family. They are adjacent to Ligma. Yes, yes, yes. Please don't call it pull requests. The bubbles don't grow. I don't think they would. Why would I think you're German? That's what she said. Jokes are currently unfunny, though. They were conceived to be unfunny. That's the thing. I genuinely think I don't really think in German or English as much. I think my thinking patterns are more closely to action. Just a bunch of logical contractions. And then I have to translate it to English if I want to talk to people. Fucked up Yoshi of the week. That's a Yoshi. Oh, yeah, that does look like it's supposed to be a Yoshi. They just forgot to paint them. That is fucked up. Hmm. Let's try something. I think this could be working pretty well. I think the forward we want, like, minus 20.5, 0.5, 0.5. Let's see how this works out. So particle, so particle doesn't exist. Oh, that's why. I wrote a dot instead of a comma. Mara will offer any Yoshi you send her. Okay, have you ever used a microwave in America? Do you guys know how fucked up microwaves in America are? If you type in 61 on a microwave in America. Your food goes shorter, it goes longer than if you type in 100. Isn't that fucked up? How is 100 less than 61 on a microwave? What's the idea for the final puzzle level? Will it be a gauntlet of everything you learned in the rocket world? Nope. It's not going to be anything too difficult because people need to be able to beat it. It's going to feel epic, but it's not going to be super difficult. What do you do, new girlfriend? Case, 100 is a minute. No, no, no, no. 100 seconds is a minute and 40. If I type 100 into the microwave, I want it to go for a minute and 40 seconds, not 60 seconds. That's why I typed 100 and not 60. Type in 140 because 140. That's fucked up. When I type in 140, I want two minutes and 20 seconds. But I've been a minute. A minute is a minute.        A minute is 60 seconds. Guys. Yes, I want this to be microwaved for 2700 seconds instead of 45 minutes. Those are not the same thing. Wait, they are. Shit. Okay, but who wants to microwave them? Foot 40 45 minutes it doesn't count i think if you type in 612 you have for six hours and one minute yeah just completely fuck it up on micros you just have to imagine a colon okay but this means if i as a human want to save time and i want my foot to be heated for a minute and 30 seconds i should type in 90 to save the amount of time on the last keystroke that's what i would do i would type in 90 didn't yes that would be the correct solution you could be saving time by not discussing this what did the mean what did the guy mean by saying i don't discuss philosophy what are we doing right now i think when it goes into the display do you want it to jump from 9 to 130 instantly now i wanted to just be in seconds if you can't do the math you deserve your food to be cold or burned fuck you that's my view personally why would 99 be 99 seconds and 100 be 60 seconds exactly that's what i mean 99 is less than 100 on a microwave see that guy gets it dude my particles aren't spawning did i set the flex wrong billboard i definitely want to billboard it random angles yes spawned circle don't care it's not animated forced to layer 1.8 is perfect okay maybe 70 is a bit much for a test let's try a higher level right here three times in stuff on the microwave real office press the plus value at seven times that works too so dude what is going on why can we not see the soap bubbles maybe i'm not spotting them maybe my idea didn't work what if that's it why would this idea not work oh wait that's why dude the best microwaves are the ones with a knob you just turn it up it completely avoids grave problem altogether okay it's definitely spawning something now that's 70 little bubbles i think no seven and it's also little bubbles or so particles instead of the bubble that we wanted so does that mean that my sparkle effect is more than i wanted how many is this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 0 2 1 2 2 3 2 4 and it's here twice so 5 0 2 7 3 and this is 0 7 3 2 7 7 and no 2 9 7 so this should be 9 8 should it not so hello zena we're making soap and discussing microwaves we should just make a minute 100 seconds then everything should be solved true but actually i wanna one of you we should switch to the hexadecimal or the 12 system instead of the shit we have right now hey it's spawning bubbles metric minutes how much is a metric minute so time is already in 12s kinda yeah 12 is a common divisor what are the numbers called 11 and 12 12 d1 12 d2 12 d3 i mean okay but you have to draw a new symbol for them too yeah yeah maybe we can do something smart there so let's be 10 and 11 not 11 12 true actually yeah yeah i mean 10 is fine right because like 10 we replace 10 with 1t right so you get 1t which is our new 12 1t1 which is 13 1t2 which is 14 and then we have 10t10 10t10 which is 120 hello joseph i don't like just fusing the composite numbers together i feel like there is a pattern to the numbers that we can analyze okay i like these soap bubbles i kind of want them to be on layer 5 though okay let me get me a list of all the numbers here numbers 1 to 10 i feel okay let's see what do they have in common ah the 9 really ruins this because like the even numbers are all like nice and round and the odd numbers are a little angular so like we can already conduct that our 11 will be a little more angular what if 11 was like the 7 with this the strike through that's our new 11 and the 10 has to be nice and round so it's gonna be like what if the 10 was like an 8 on its side let's see 100 instead of a thousand i mean technically true so and if i got the seven seconds display case don't do it graphic numeral ocs yeah that is what we're doing into seven segment displays oh oh but my 7 idea would work yeah my 7 would look like an inverted f on those and then that's like our new 11. what do we do for the 10? i guess it can be like a 6 with the head missing or like an 8 with the top missing that's our new 10. yeah this works let me let me draw you my new numbers so our new 10 is gonna be this and our new 11 is gonna be this and on an 8 segment one it would or 7 segment one it would look like this is our 10 and this is our 11 bootleg 7 and 8 all the numbers are bootlegs of other versions what the 3 is a bootleg 8 if you look at it that way the 0 is a bootleg 8 no no no no you guys are being unfair here so all the numbers are just bootlegs of other numbers so they're slandering you on the gleam strips and what what does 7 segment display have to do with mario 64? it's complicated oh it's getting dark too i don't like that that's probably just a stupid mistake in in this file yep so i have heard of bingus a lot and based off of super mario 54 yeah that is also true what it doesn't actually multiply with the alpha why not oh i know why wrong layer now bingus is okay with typing 100 for 60 seconds on the microwave fuck them what was what you came up with this 11 isn't it's everything else i mean it says it's a danger to seven it's often written from one and messy handwriting that is a legitimate argument yes i agree okay we got soap bubbles i feel like we need more though we need like a slimy trail behind it how does the soap trail look like in cartoons so  it does like this it was also transparent bubbles you want me to make the bubbles more transparent they are already transparent but i can make them more transparent and i can also spawn a lot more bubbles let's try this like the mario 64 bubbles i that that is the mario 64 bubble texture that i just took yeah this amount of bubbles looks a lot better already did i take a bad mario 64 texture base 6 is nicer than base 12 but you'd have to type so many digits super mario 104 doesn't really have the same ring to it that that's not even right is it that's that's not no that's not 64 in basics keep the particles on the floor also an idea yeah what if we make them just very slightly floaty and only some of them like so and size and variation size and variation is very easy to achieve with this tons of bubbles you're saying okay tons of bubbles it's a good thing we have a good particle engine otherwise this would be awful dude if you count on if you count numbers on your hands then you don't deserve to use my new number system i'm sorry that's a lot more we we can just define a bubble frequency it's not actually frequency well i mean it is frequency but it's just a fucked up unit yeah i have my own particle system the original particle system is really bad because it overloads the texture every time so rendering 10 bubbles like this would load the bubble texture 10 times child labor is like one of the most lucrative things in the business if you look at minecraft roblox you know all the games that have like a creative aspect to them child labor is what carries those games children make custom game modes that other children play and that's how the game like gets all the content and an empty center you want that even more i just doubled it too okay let me see if i can find tomorrow 64 ball somewhere so i think it's my child labor so if children choose to work then it's not child labor is that what you're saying i don't think that's true at all i think a lot of children would choose to work just because their family is so poor that they can't afford not to work that's why child labor is so widespread dude mario 64 modding also lives on child labor in a way yeah somehow this texture doesn't have to transfer an aspect to it i don't know why there's not labor because i'm making it for fun and not to earn money roblox has v bucks you can donate to the creator of the map so they are earning money and you can't prove that they're not doing it because of that i feel like a lot of them are doing it because of that or like fortnite creative modes too okay where's the bubble texture though it wasn't in here what if it's in here oh is this the one you want i don't think i need this let me just verify i didn't need that it's labor as entertainment ah okay i guess i'm working for an adult who takes all the bros for themselves people make games no no roblox aren't you proving it oh so there's actual proof that roblox is child labor are you saying i'm right damn whoops i don't know how to open this in gimp what is wrong with me there oh that looks cool How do we improve the texture? I don't like this. I'm not putting your face on it. This just looks fucked up, doesn't it? Make a fit from pastel pink to white as time goes on. I'm thinking about whether that's possible right now. I think it is. Let's make this pinkish. You have to be a bit brighter. That's gonna be our bubble texture. Let me see if I can make biobacks wish to have this fade to white come true. Shit, it'll actually start here. So it starts here and would go to this. That's not good enough. What if we add texture zero color? Go here and then we get more white. Now if you make this texture a bit darker. Trust the process, guys. Shit. I think this is hopeless because it always does that. We can make it an eye texture. That might be the better choice. Although that would kind of get rid of the pinkish outline, which I'm a bit sad about. Also, I want the fade to white to happen first because the fade to white is not really there yet and I kind of want that. I can't do it to psycho material, unfortunately. Well, actually, I can, but I really don't want to. We can't software in that because it exists more than once, at least not without some serious pain. I mean, if you really wanted, we could multiply by nth color and then an nth color to this. And then we can make this the opposite of pink. And then we make the other one more pink. Okay. Now we need to multiply this by pink. Guys, if you don't want to watch me make a fucking bubble texture, you came to the wrong stream. Like, what were you expecting from the stream?  Actual progress. Wait. This is progress. That is not a multiply layer. That is... What? How is this a multiply layer? How is zero alpha multiplied by pink a hundred alpha? Hey? This is almost as bad as microwaves.  Definitely a hair moment. Okay, I need some even pinker.  Adding visual flare is important to the game. You can't just not add visual flare to the game. Your game would just look like a shadow of a game and not a real game. Wait, this is the opposite of what we want. Oh wait, that's the nth color. Oops. Okay, now it goes from normal to white. This is what Biomech has asked for. So okay so funny thing nthcolor is disabled on my repo because of fuzz64 so i do need to edit this a little bit to make this work correctly instead of gsp.add.setnthcolor there's a different color i have to use  all right let's see the house detection not defined did i delete that on accident i did all right here we go can n64 do author to non-products though obviously okay that mostly looked like what we wanted i think let me let me take a look again okay it looks like the alpha is not set right they pop in like right before they disappear oh i see i think the computation just works out to 255 on accident i think they might be staying a little too long no that doesn't make any sense i might be setting the alpha wrong to like that of the next particle or something he added a popping frame instead of just fading out oh man it's like the alpha is applied to the wrong one so i think it's applied to the next particle instead of this particle all right i'm not sure if what i did just now was the right decision well no i would have to also keep track of the state of all the bubbles and add the popping to them okay this looks really good now i like this a lot i think the alpha is maybe a bit too dark still but other than that it's more on the y-axis yep i'm thinking of just doubling the primitive color nowhere near enough bubbles i think they're just so dark that you can barely see them okay that is a truly awful idea  i think the alpha needs to be higher so are some of them going into the floor is that the issue because sometimes it feels like there's way more bubbles than other times so sometimes there's so few and sometimes there's so many i think that is the issue here how does well right range actually get processed here maybe some of them stay in the floor and that's the issue so hello lc they're still so wait a second what if now the index is moving so quickly that not all the bubbles are spawning because this is set to spawn 200 bubbles in total and i don't think there was 200 bubbles so every tomorrow is gonna be good just like 23 more hours let's do this differently let's just store a bubble progress somewhere so that's not a real field macro 108 that works for me so so i remember back when we were on twitch and we had a channel point reward that lets you ask a dumb question i wish we had that on youtube too oh there we go this is what i want you don't remember that wait we've had that for like half a year i think so sorry guys of course you can make co-op but i literally made co-op on decomp which is the new mario 64 modding tool so oh nice lz that's pretty good guys i think we're done with the bubble i think we're done with the soap honestly we programmed the whole soap bar just today that's that's not that bad with a pretty sick effect next we need to make an oil sploosh here that you can clean up with the bubble rtx yi honestly that's a sick name honestly maybe i made rtyi just so that acronym could be a thing so maybe it should leave a pink trail but let's think about how to make the oil slick first so it could just be a single 64x64 actually a 64x64 won't work how does an oil sploosh look like is that even a word a sploosh oil puddle should the soap only consume when cleaning the spill no i think it can always consume i don't want the player running around on soap through the whole level here you just count a puddle of sploosh what is a sploosh i'm not english what is a sploosh is that not a puddle so yeah we want something kind of like this no what is okay i'm going to google the words what i did not know that so when google says sploosh just means to come i did i was not aware so just take the gunk from stone section as the problem with that gunk is that it doesn't look well when you clean it up i'm thinking of a way to make it so that we have a dynamic texture that like cleans itself up it sounds like the british word for coming or something so hmm hmm we could have a normal oil texture and then an alpha mask and if you go over the thing the alpha mask like slowly fills up this is scrumptious man i'm having a sploosh in it yeah like that okay but also i kind of this to be a reflective material so i kind of want this to be normal mapped what if we just have one texture wait what if the normal what if the texture is just a normal map like this and then we have an alpha mask on top of it and then we just edit the alpha mask that sounds perfect to me oh but having an end Map would make the alpha mask not work at all. What if we dynamically generate UV coordinates and it also doesn't work because then the alpha map would be broken. Maybe we cannot make this run reflective unless we use a custom look at matrix and f3d lights. Just model the puddles, you're cleaning them up Lila, the model would have to dynamically change. It's gonna be very similar to the wet cement system, baby. True PC port would make this so easy, true. But also the PC port is so hard in case you could never work on it because it's just so much harder. But on a PC port this would be so easy to do. We should just switch. SMK? I don't know what that is. Can we just like go and touch this resource? Nope, that's the wrong one. Let's see if they have some oil, maybe that will give us inspiration. That's a texture. We get a mesh grid and when you stand on the relics it sinks to the ground so it looks like you're cleaning it. Can we still go to the end where it says mama, fucker and kills balls and newgrounds fashion? Sure, I can.  Drop. Hmm. Where can I get an oil puddle? 1,700 oil puddle pictures. There's gotta be the right one in here somewhere. Donut for free, no thank you, not like that. I'm fine with this. We're gonna make this one work. Honestly, I like the edit detail there. What about a mark? I don't see it. My favorite vegetable? Shit, what is the definition of vegetable? I don't want to say something stupid here. Because I know there's like, people are gonna be like, oh, that's not a vegetable, that's a fruit. I think a vegetable is one that's in the ground. Broccoli, cabbage. Broccoli is kind of sick, honestly. Shit. Maybe it is broccoli. There's a thing called red cabbage that we have in Germany. It's pretty good, too. I think I gotta go with red cabbage. Fruits and plants or vegetables can be pretty much any other part of the plant. I don't like sauerkraut. Sauerkraut is red cabbage, but red. It looks, it's honestly, it's purple. But yeah, kinda. Well, no, it's actually very different. It's like, it's like a spaghetti of cabbage. Why does red cabbage taste so good? I'll show you what it is. Okay, this looks disgusting. This is more like it. This is not how you eat it, though. This is more like it. Okay.  So, Biomex IDS, we have a potter like this, which so far looks fine. And then when you clean it, it just does that. I don't know about this. I think this might be a bit bad. Just make it the shape of a puddle. Yeah, but that would be even more triangles. But no, it just looks bad the way it fades out. Okay. Why not just two triangles? Were you paying attention? That was not the intention. We were trying to make it work without needing that. No. Yep. Yeah, if you change the format to like a grayscale one, you can use like a 64x64. Just play around with the formats a little. Similar to how your centrals work? Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, too. We're just gonna make it so that if you are on here, it's gonna happen. It's gonna delete all the alpha, I think. Let me check how that would look. Is there like an eraser tool here? Which ones of these is the eraser? Eraser. Radira. Oh, that one's a bit big. Honestly, that looks fine. Like Mario's just gonna be an eraser going through here like this. Would that be so bad? We could even make this black again. Yeah. I think that would look perfectly fine. That would look really cool. I like this. No shine effect, though? Yes. That is a disadvantage. No, I can't think of a single way to add a shine effect. Smash Bros. Shit, that was Smash Bros. Dynamic vertex colors. We're going too far. It's a small oil puddle. Add a light source. It's a flat triangle. Light source don't do anything. Let me see how this would look like if I actually also made it black. So we have Mario going through here, which makes everything black. And then we have him going through here, which erases it. The edge looks fine to me, honestly. Let me note that down real quick. Oil slick. And Mario goes through with soap. Delete the alpha and all the pixels he's touched. And make the pixels black. And the surrounding pixels. Also use some alpha. This is going to be a pain to program. Vertex color hue shift based on camera angle. I mean, it could work. Let me see how good that would be. We could do... ...textural color in here. Penif color multiplied by shade color. Set prim to just full on. Set this to black. And then we could have it like this camera angle. These are being set to this. That's not really a good shine though, is it? At this angle it might be like this maybe. It doesn't really look like a shine. It just kind of looks like it changes color. Let's try that. Some hue variation. Let's try that. So are you thinking of this just being like all different hues? I'm not really sure I understand the idea. It says Yoshi Star Galaxy from our Galaxy 2. If you have only front and back painting and some colors that you then hue shift according to angle might actually work very well. That looks perfect. What? Am I missing something? No. No, I want an oil puddle. I don't want car tips. I just want to see an oil puddle.  See how flinching the end frame shifts color kind of randomly when you move the camera? Then let's move rainbow gradient instead. I see what you mean. So you want me to map different... Wait, just the camera angle or also the vertex position? Because I could just use the jaw and the pitch of the camera and the position of the vertex to generate a random hue and put it on here. That wouldn't be difficult. I could even make this continuous in space and keep some proximity. So it's like vertices that are close by are receiving similar hues. Is that what you want? So that it looks kind of like this, I guess. Is that how oil puddles look like though? Aren't there some in Mario Kart 8? How do they look? That's ink. Which nevertheless the oil slicks. Mario Kart style oil slick on London Bridge. I don't see it. Nope, that's not architecture mode. I don't see it. No, the performance can still be improved. They're making it just black in Mario Kart. I'm sure there's a reason for it. Guys, I think I want to go with just black. Yeah, it's definitely black with just a normal map. The rainbow looks so much cooler. It just looks random to me. The literal oil in your level is here, it does. Guys. I wish I just had oil here, I could spill on the floor and look at. I feel like I need to actually see oil. Should I just go to the tank station or something? The gas station. I need to see oil here. Okay, to be honest, it's going to be super easy to program that. It's not going to take a lot of time. So what if we just worry about the other effect first? And hopefully by then I have seen some oil and I can actually make this work. That's gasoline. What? I wish I was able to find videos of oil. What if we google for an oil spill? Maybe that will show us something. Nothing. Maybe a video? I can't find anything. I don't know what to do.    I'm going to do a rainbow one first to see what looks good in the game. If it looks good and it feels like oil doesn't actually make it to the classic. Like how real your name doesn't go green. Yes, still I would feel better about it if I had actually seen oil before. So I have an idea on what it's usually looking like. Let's see. We're not going to be able to have him. Actually we are able to have him for a prince. Yeah, that would be a lot of extra work too, but it's possible. Okay. What the fuck? I ruined the object. What is this? How do I get back to normal? I would like custom please. What the fuck? Where is custom? Right here. A classic party land, oh that's an extreme, yep. Classic. I don't know how to fix it, I don't know how to fix it either, I just use all three of my monitors and two monitors combined were big enough to house the window. Yes, you can't complain about me not just finishing like a whole star per stream or something. That'd be ridiculous if I could do that. Don't worry about it, I am panicking, I am literally losing it. If you get too knocked out you can just put it back, that's not true, that's fate. There's no way that's true. It's true, look it up. What do you want me to google for? Putting a tooth back in. I don't wanna, that sounds nasty. Why would that work better? Does the flash just take the tooth back and it just regrows around it or something? Wow this looks terrible, oh my god this looks so bad. I absolutely hate this. This is actually genuinely awful. Alright, let's not do that. I don't want large texture for this either, I'm just using IA-16. I should be using that anyway and just so the computation is easier. Okay after I have this done I'm gonna experiment with the colors, how about that? They are so good, wait so can I steal someone else's tooth? Can you request a song? It costs money? Yeah this is way better. Okay, let's try the vertex color idea. This looks too bright to me. Slipperiness, what are you talking about? Oh ice physics? Ice physics would be very cool for this, yeah. I'm fine with that, it looks too flat. It's gonna look completely different after we have the colors in. How come every stream Lila realizes once again that I have gone rogue? Doesn't she know by now? The white edges look weird, I don't think they're real. Wait, are the white edges in-game? I hope not. What the fuck? There we go, normal white edges, I hope. Dude remember when Lila kept telling me to fix the steel beams and then she tried to fix them and it didn't work? I'm still crying about that. It wasn't just specs, it was blending the color here into just white because the background was white. It was transparent white. I have like an rgba to hsv thing somewhere, oh there we go. Hmm let's actually do four and this can be an s32. Oh wait, it translates these hsv values, that's not good. Hs and v, that should do it. H undeclared, oops, that's u. And it just needs to be s2 and v2, let's see what we get. Rip iCache, no, what? Well we're definitely getting random hues. Not really the ones I want, not colorful enough, I agree. I need to be more darker. I made it more darker and more saturated though. Yeah that's not so bad. I don't like how there's a reflection in the old texture itself. I don't like it. Shifting a bit too quickly, I agree. I am making it slower right now. I feel like it's a bit too bright as well and the texture just isn't good because of the black stuff here and the white stuff there. How do I get rid of the shine here? I would like it to get darker towards all the edges I think, actually it's not that   Guys, I will let you know I can't draw for shit. Why is this not giving me a smaller brush? Oh, I guess I changed the wrong value. Oh no. Guys, this will look less bad when you downscale it, I promise. What did I say? Who made the grass texture? Which grass texture? Draw a random shape, dark grey shape, plus a green. That's actually a very good point. I think this works though. I kind of wish it was darker. Let's make it darker. It's going to look better like this, because now the colours will have an easier time just coming through. The one in the wing get messed? I don't know. It might just be a stolen one. But yeah, you can render on the CPU whatever you want, because it's Turing complete, obviously. I think the influence of draw is bad. What if we did this without draw? That doesn't make any sense. Let's make the draw influence this less. Yeah, normal mob aiming is not very practical in the actual application here. Okay, 9 was apparently way too much, because now it only has two states. That doesn't make much sense though, because it's a 16-bit value. Why would this be happening? Scripting tutorial. Well, the first thing I would need to know is how to even start scripting. And then after that, I would need to know where the variables are that I want to change. I think scripting itself is pretty self-explanatory, so that doesn't need to be there. But I mean, I'm talking as a programmer, so it's kind of a worthless opinion. I don't think you should ask me for tips on this. Might look good if the camera distance is also considered. I mean, I could easily add that. But I don't really see an issue with this, that the draw doesn't look right. Let's try 7. What the fuck? Okay. Why did my microphone mute itself? And why did no one say anything up until now? I was asking if this is good now. Biomech, what do you think? Is this how you wanted the oil? See, I usually have my microphone muted, and I think OBS just saved that setting. So when it crashed, it just muted myself again. Looks fantastic. All right, perfect. Well, I'm getting really fucking hungry, and we just had a crash anyway. So I think it is time to call it a day. Next time, maybe I'll have the oil slick finished, and we'll give you a Yoshi coin. But I'll be gone for now. And I'll see you guys next Saturday or tomorrow, if you're gonna watch F3, which you really should. Because it's gonna be really good. Until then, bye bye.
