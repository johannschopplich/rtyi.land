It's time to say hello hi hi doesn't talk like that I could talk however I damn please hello sonic the Hedgehog Hedge Scott hello external might let me just post my live stream on my discord server hello cereal hello burp hello some here oh man this thumbnail is awful Wow I ran some pulse it seems that most of my community prefers my streams to be on YouTube so YouTube is what we do pretty weird change I'm gonna miss twitch okay blacks from moon that is not the kind of vibes I want to bring to this stream hello born as a gamer what OST shall we listen to today all right let's do it just that's genuinely unbearable at this point I can't see how you might suit your streams a little better yeah I literally just hate twitch now I don't watch twitch anymore at all cuz it's just too bad hello Alex gamer since when we did a test stream around two weeks ago and it went well and I've ran some polls in my community and it seems pretty clear that people prefer YouTube so we are currently working on the right here he's supposed to chase after me a little bit yes we do need a walk cycle please that is having him float around like that like he's the fucking what do you call it you know those little floor vacuums he's a Roomba he's a Roomba he's a very intimidating looking Roomba but we need to just this OST is too loud okay yeah it's also the issue that he can't step up here so he does need to step up physics for this I've never seen this fight before we just started making this fight so Melee Bowser Run Cycle that was really funny Melee Bowser Run Cycle? The Melee Bowser does this where you just like on the toe yeah return to Yoshi's Island release date really that is interesting hello Lilaa okay so first thing we do when Bowser enters any action state that is not running he should lose the speed pretty quickly excited to play that's very nice he also should be turning faster when he has more damage no hi to me okay no hi to you either Lilaa oh it needs to be move angle pitch that's why it didn't work this is gonna be a very interesting one to make a walk I did start a walk but it was so bad that I didn't continue it it probably needs to be a pretty slow walk like he's actually a turtle is your use of the turning operator here purely stylistic or does it compile down into a few instructions are you referencing the chat GPT video or is that a real question because the chat GPT video was funny as fuck to me with the turning operator then it's a real question okay the turning operator it's the exact same as doing an if else compiler wise but when you ask chat GPT it keeps telling you to use the ternary operation and it's really stupid even if you tell I don't tell me about the ternary operator it doesn't do anything it will still tell you hey how about you use the ternary operator this man is just guessing release dates just let him be here's just a zoo and a synthwave I like the zoo and I like level themes that are easily understood but also very unique so the zoo is cool the theme park is cool what else do we have that's cool the ghost chips can I need you don't want to spend $200 on flash cut and since you I'll just get one of those off-brand Chinese ever drives they play every game except Pokemon Stadium 2 and they work just as well and they're like a fifth of the price I did not know that on your night hello electricoon case from twitch is most likely gone we are probably permanently on YouTube now oh yeah all-alone bubbledome is really cool too I don't know if you guys have seen this but there is some huge differences to all-alone bubbledome since the demo it looks very very different now like different in a good way the actual final game is so unrecognizable from the demo right now it's actually crazy the most recognizable level from it is probably the cave or the cloud cap level yeah I upload a lot to this channel in this level to hold stars which is completely different now and we can scan buying over eBay you can buy it wherever you want you can just get it off Amazon the Chinese sellers are usually reliable they are professionals after all you said not to move Bankok should do a new video Panko has no idea what my engine is and all the tricks he's doing don't really work in my engine anymore because I had to fix a lot of the bugs to make stuff work more consistently so that kind of screws with everything he's doing you haven't played the demo even if you did play the demo now the final game is basically a completely new experience sm64 with rty optimizations is hopefully gonna come out one day but I want to finish rty I first because even now I keep finding new optimizations it makes no sense to try and like make a Mario 64 version now and then have to apply all the optimizations I find to two things at once it's just too many he keeps finding he finds a new one on a daily basis yeah just recently we have we have the most correct sine and cosine function now look at look at this beauty here we're using imaginary numbers he said twice as fast RAM wouldn't be the one thing you would add to rty I no idea I don't think I would add anything I would just have the game run at 60 FPS I am not Russian because of your arm with these up yes one day but I don't know when I need to finish this mod first okay so we do have Bowser Bowser is walking at you but Bowser is not stepping up on the walls as you're supposed to let's see why that would be awesome y equals 20 okay so 20 coordinates is what you can step up on this is 50 coordinates makes sense that he can step up on it we could make this sloped which honestly might just be better because this is also a bit awkward for Mario to interact with so if you make the slope like this Bowser should be able to just walk up on it too bad good coders are dying in games camera but easy feature combination now yeah game dev is really or general development it's very safe you it's made so that it is very easy for any programmer to get into a project or to work on a project and to contribute and the reason for that is that doing it this way you can get more people into the workforce and the more people you have in the workforce the more productive the field is a total right so you can't really write good codes because bad programmers are not gonna be able to work with good code so really like the industry just discourages writing good code now for the reason that people do need to be able to actually work on your games my touch that is showing up again oh fuck god damn it I did that again you can't really stream to both platforms can you it's not a lot but it's just the OS that's dumb but I guess I get it can definitely need to make that thing climbable it's a bit weird how soon you start going up there so the idea here is gonna be that you have to grab bozos tail and from off the ship and he's gonna jump back to his castle once that happens the first time has to be very easy and then it has to get faster and faster when you start coding what age I started programming on my calculator when I was like 12 so I do technically you have like 15 years of experience well I also don't know how to stream to two platforms at once otherwise I might just do it but then I wouldn't be able to read twitch chat so like what's the point yeah my first tech was when I was 17 it's a big Yoshi platform for this is where the Yoshi ships are gonna land and you're gonna jump on them and you're gonna attack both of them I just skipped that phase of the fight right now so I can work on this one here you know what there's a better way to handle this instead of doing this which is kind of ugly we can modify the platform we could just have a landing strip like this it kind of works it's your muscles no we're not turning this into a weird ear girl stream but why not YouTube chat on screen I don't know how to actually I know how to do it but it's weird we don't need it if it's a YouTube live stream anyway we don't need to chat because the chats gonna be right there for anyone watching this and post how am I so good at coding and stuff I literally was just born with the ability to code I don't know why no one knows why my son just said he wanted to play Super Mario 64 free players ah shit I only made a two-player version who would the third player be how would that look on a screen case come on be real be real with what will you yield that the movie was fun I hope everyone seen the movie we can talk about the movie you don't know how to coach us magically no no of course I had to get the knowledge but like the skill of how to do it the understanding of how to do it it was just magically there I'm coding skill and coding knowledge are two very different things oh this is what I had okay okay well this just changed my view of how I want this to be so this has beveled edges we can use beveled edges for that it's my birthday can you please make a sure buddy do a joking okay nevermind no 8 player that is not what I wanted there we go elbows I should be able to step up on this and it shouldn't look weird hello bio back case do you have the gargoyle tank here too I don't know how to put tags I don't streams just saying I had the coolest idea for them oh I could strum barado over a ketone paranoia casa true yeah the bubblegum shot is actually very popular in the shop too it is one of the most popular ones suppose I can't walk up here that's not good that's really fun I like that they like that that's cool I should put more shirt more course icons on the shirt thing hello a big legend you kissing them on the mouth no questions asked they would probably know who you are if you tell them you have that shirt nope I'm not using tomorrow 64 DS model it is I hate Mario 64 DS an actual insult to gaming yeah it's very chill we're not having Mario carry around the Pikachu what do you think this is that's so fan gamey okay but seriously why can't Bowser walk up on this if you wanted to recreate the minigames from 64 DS and Mario 64 that would take a while that's basically what's holding back a full Mario 64 DS recreation on Mario 64 oh yeah I found I found the sick optimization recently I'll tell you about it in just a second because I just realized I messed up by putting this into the wrong thing this was supposed to go here this was just yesterday and where I found something that makes the game run a lot better I hope I can undo all this you know what that let me undo enough to fix this okay so let me tell you about this optimization and Mario 64 there is a bug in find floor from list so Mario 64 as soon as it found a single surface here that Mario can be on it stops iterating the surfaces right which let's say you have a surface like this and a surface like this and Mario is here you're gonna find this surface you're gonna find the below surface but not the above surface Mario falls through one of the surfaces right so surfaces hide each other so to prevent that in the add surface function here and Mario 64 they have like a sorting direction and they sort surfaces from the one that is highest the highest point to the one that has the lowest point but let's say there's one surface like this and one surface like this right then this surface here is gonna be above this one so you can just walk down the slope in into the floor we call that surface cocking or floor cocking but Here's the optimization. So since we need to fix floor clacking like this, we originally had to remove the sorting priority as well. But I had the idea, what if we just keep the sorting priority, and we kill all the floors that are too high, and then we can just only iterate 0x10 bytes of each floor? So if we look at the server struct, all we need is the upper Y and the lower Y. So we only load this data into the dcache, and we can prevent loading this and this, which is very good. So we put chat on stream so that I could watch you without closing full screen. Oh, that's what it's for. That would be good, yes. I agree. How do I do that? Anyone know? Well, I mean, watching me on two screens might also be a bit impractical. Wait, someone subscribed? VTARG subscribed on Twitch. Well, thank you for the sub, VTARG. Although, guys, the YouTube sub icons are really cute. I'm not just saying this because I want your money, but I do want to see them. They're very cute. You should subscribe. Thank you for my $5 or whatever. OK, so this should have fixed Bowser so that he can walk on the thing now. Twitch actually only gives you a 50-50 card, which sucks. I think YouTube is 70-30. It's another good reason to switch to YouTube. If you donate to a stream on Twitch, Jeff Bezos gets 50% of that money. You're basically donating half of the money to Amazon. Can just capture the chat in power mode. Yeah, but that's kind of hideous, right? Oh, God, what the fuck is this? This is not at all the collision I wanted.  Something's really messy here. I mean, I should probably do this anyway for just consistency reasons. But still, that's not how I imagined this would go. $2.20, thank you for the money, EpicLegend. Hello, where can I learn to run? I'm a huge fan. There is, because you donated, I'm going to pull this one up just for you. There is a document in the SimpleFlips server that has a bunch of tutorials that I'm going to send to you. Right here. Hello, devpool.z64. This could just add the window capture OBS and capture the chat in pop-out mode. Yeah, but that's really hideous. Check your Discord. That's how French people spell Discord. Oh, bunny tutorial signs. I will get those in a second. Egg unshaded. It's got Radex colors. You can add the browsers like that. That would be very nice. Yes, I agree. OK, so what you're going to have to do is you're going to have to grab Bowser's tail, spin him in front of the edge. So that's what we should be programming next. I think I removed all the code that allows Mario to grab Bowser, because I thought I wouldn't need it. But now I do need it, so I kind of have to bring it back. What music do you use for star collection? I can show you. You're going to like this. Wait, did I move past the warp? Wait, is the warp gone? No. Let me get a star and show you. While I'm getting a star, I also want to show you guys the sick movement that RTYI has. Look how fun it is to just move Mario. Oh, I fell through the star. Something really broke with interactions. Somehow I must have broken interaction boxes. They're way too small. Wait, this didn't used to be an issue. How did this happen? Let me check my GitHub desktop. There must be one random change I made. Let's see, are we listening to? We are listening to the Birth of Wild OST. I don't think I broke this part. I might have broken like a fundamental sine and cosine function. I did change the audio, yes. I did include this one in the mario.h. This might honestly be what's causing all this. Mario's flickering is just a random issue somewhere. It's going to be very easy to figure out. You don't have to worry about it. I don't think this is causing those issues. I think it is because I included the engine in the mario.h file right here. Let me remove that and see if that helps. I will need to add this to other functions, other folders, but it will be fine. Yeah, randomU16 is missing. Did he say it's hard, Bart, to code another Brilliantium video, but I need to compare them? Wait, what? Oh, oh, I see, I see. Yes, that honestly, I kind of want to make that, but on the other side, I don't want my YouTube channel to be just spammed with AI, you know? Yeah. OK, if I do this, then the randomU16 function is missing a bunch of shit. Let's see if that fixes the physics. Yeah, my random values are all stored in the table. Mario64 generates them in runtime. That's pretty inefficient. OK, that looks like it fixed it. Let me show you another six star you can do.  This game is basically built for speedrunning. No, I don't have a test level. OK, so next, we need to program Bowser being grabbable. With his tail. So for that, we need to program a new tail hitbox. I think we have a behavior hitbox already. We do. And I'm not sure if I can use hidden blue coin switch here, but I will try. Oh, shit, you're right. I need to do the textboxes. OK, we'll do the textboxes first. Because Biobak just sent me a model he made that I need to take a look at for the tutorial bunnies. Have you considered bringing back some of the textboxes   like the ranking system from Mario64 Land? It wouldn't really work in Return to Yoshi's Island, would it? How would you think it should work? I mean, OK, I do plan there to be one Yoshi that kind of gives you a ranking. You know how the green stars work in Mario Galaxy? There's going to be like Yoshi stars that you can get like that. Oh, you use two textures? Two 48 by 48 textures. And this is an 80 by 84 texture. OK, actually makes sense. Kind of makes sense. Is this? Why is this two textures, but the others are just one? What's this stuff above it? I don't know. What the fuck? How long have you been using Blender for? I have no idea. I'm not really thinking a bunch of stuff like that. I just kind of make games. Yo, Epic Legend, thank you for becoming a member. You now have the symbol. You have an egg. I wonder what's going to hatch. Something wrong happened to the UI? No. Oh. Well, how is Nintendo going to ban the mod? What I'm doing is perfectly legal. Like, they literally cannot ban me from doing this. Ooh. New boxes for the bunnies. Yep. Yeah, we should probably delay open sourcing the game a little from the initial release, just so Nintendo doesn't instantly take it down. Oh, my fucking god. Why FAST64? There we go. Let's check the tutorials. I think there's going to be an issue here. Yeah, I think they might be translated vertically, but we'll see. For how much? Maybe like two months? Yeah, also, you know, because to hide Easter eggs and stuff, that also makes sense. Why do they have two bones? FAST64 requires those to be there. They're not real bones in-game. Why does the button prompt have bones? It's alive, yes. No, it's just so that we can make sure that they actually show properly. Yeah, this is not what I wanted. The prompts look good, though. They do look alive. I'm not going to add options for music. Why are people always so keen on options? I hate options. I think games should give you as few options as possible, as little as you can get away with. I'm being serious. Not yet, Lila. I'm making a walk cycle for Bowser right now, just because the boss fight looks kind of funny. I hate video games. I'm Kaze, I hate video games. I hate options. Options, look, options are bad. You don't want to give your players too much choice. There's an actual psychological experiment carried out where if you give someone the option to pick between two flavors of candy, they're going to be happy with that choice, much happier with that choice than if you give them 10 flavors to pick from. Even if the other two are still in there, because the more options there are, the less... Yeah, that is actually just proven. More options, more confusion. It doesn't really apply to the situation, though, because this isn't candies to pick from. Still, it's kind of a good-bad-faith argument. OK, a better argument is that a bunch of options are just unnecessarily confusing and people aren't going to have all the same experience, which I don't like. Let's say you have 10 flavors of ice cream. Also, what Xylpheon said. I hate when games... Let me turn the BGM down. No, that's different. You need a... OK, look, if you're blind, you're not going to play this game. I'm sorry. I'm not going to make sure that blind people can play this game. Nothing against blind people, but I feel like if you're blind, you shouldn't be playing Mario 64, a platformer game. You should be playing maybe like a text-based adventure game. How's a blind person going to play this game? You're gatekeeping. No, he asked for a completely different song to be in this level. That is something else. Yeah, like if there was an easy way to add colorblind mode, I would. Implement audio. Oh, I'll just like implement an AI that just reads out the screen to you. OK, why did the tutorial signs do that, though? It should be in the bunny behavior. Aren't they just static objects, though? They are static objects. I don't know why.   Get they were bouncing up and down like they were having a matrix issue. Well, that might be ugly, uglier than the option of not doing that. So fully colored people, though. So I don't know.    So. OK, what the fuck is this? Why would this be happening? This coincides with the frame rate, doesn't it? Yellow got 30 FPS, it doesn't happen. What? I have a theory. It's because of this function. It's because I changed how this works. It should be. This is actually required because of something in some spawn functions.  Because if you look at the Bowser function here. Now. There is a good reason this was here. It's because when you spawn something, it's interpolated position is not going to be set properly. So we do need to make sure that spawned objects have their interpolated position set properly. But since the sign was using this function here, which I thought was safe to use, it wasn't. That happened because the sign offsets itself every frame after this function has been called. Now it should be fine. Hello, Dakota. Hey, background noise. I'm happy I can provide that. You bet four players in 64 is impossible. Well, you would lose that bad, so you shouldn't. New stream, new fucked up Yoshi for you. Is this Mario Sunshine? It's a pretty good fucked up Yoshi. It still does this. Oh, I just forgot to remove this. Never mind. Don't worry. Don't worry. We're fine. So just an attribute pure. It's already const. Wait, what? Well, I guess it's not const, it's pure technically. It's pure not defined here. He's seeing this shit. Might be candidate for. Attribute pure well I can pilot tell me that oh wait I think I know why oh come on we won't see the arrow now this is fine pure allows for global state changes no it doesn't oh well pure allows that global state change but it doesn't allow the function itself to change global states if that's what you mean right pure just means the function itself doesn't change anything and yes const should just be bigger than pure so it doesn't make any sense to me why the compiler is telling me that I should be using pure there if I'm already using const which technically the function is not const but in practice it is going to be const that's why I used const it looks like they work now they still need animations perfect we lose the gargoyle and it's really sad about the gargoyle tech we can't put a put a button here can we probably can yes const is just a stricter pure yet the compiler is complaining that I should be using pure so I just put on const pure just to stop the compiler from wanting me right let me just show you what happens where's the function here function might be candidate for it to be pure so just an area pure const pure why I might as well find this one this const because it doesn't do anything I think this has to be here just for stuff to compile correctly oh actually I can remove it okay nice always need to get rid of something I caused the issue earlier because I was it's very complicated don't worry about it hello mr. cool dude yes I am a YouTube streamer now I think all right back to programming both a steelhead box let's check the model so we can get the right values here I also need to save this one it's just removing comments yeah the comment was useless the bucket described just doesn't exist in this way bossa my native country is Germany oh my god YouTube is telling you how much money you made with the stream that's amazing surely that's not gonna have a negative impact on streamer culture I remember when streamers on Twitch used to hide like their view because they were nervous because of it narc gargoyle is this where my heart lives so one eight six point a half and nope I don't care about the account there could be like a thousand people here and if the chat was chill I wouldn't care I don't really get nervous I am barely even a human he's a fair matrix needs to more speed some reason materials in the zoo model and removing the ones that are just used on three police would save microseconds right yes if you use the material that was only done on three polygons that and the material is 64 by 64 you would save 31 microseconds thank you for the 5c got very very kind of you I wish I had a notification for YouTube stream donations I will look into that let me make a note extreme notifications for very important can it works be part of the model instead of hard-coding it you can attach a hitbox to a joint yes you would have to harker to join itself but if you do that you need to do like the matrix math which is gonna be more expensive and you need to add like a bone there as well so doing this actually just saves a matrix multiplication which is more optimal can I do that wait let me check that let me check if I can just link streamlabs to YouTube if I can then we're gonna have notifications in a second okay well I guess I guess I'm on streamlabs now oh my god it wants me to set up a party I'll do this after the stream you can do track six for music as well the string abstract you're gonna be in trouble since it's one of your main channels oh okay that is a very good point I don't remember the arguments of this parent spell way of service there we go yo reticus thank you for becoming a member as well can't wait for the first person to have the egg edge it's gonna be so cute how's my day pretty well we got gifts for you so for my parents that just arrived we have so much chocolate now they spoil us with chocolate yeah and they gave me cereal I like from Germany honestly I'm more excited about the cereal than the chocolate but then well you know what that's because Germany makes the best cereal on the planet Canadian cereal sucks so let's look into the right hitbox here should probably make it generous like a hundred radius is good hope there's another egg in the back I hope so too Germany has pretty good chocolate pizza for breakfast I'm going to make this go all the way down here so don't upset it's gonna be a hundred I don't cold pizza in the morning honestly I kind of like cold pizza hey I'm making pizza next no it's a saucy dip it's a real thing you can't you can't lick my me with real things that is literally just unfair but that's unfair it's like oh you like imagine dragons it's like yeah I do the kind of make good music sometimes it's not fair no it should be an extra interaction subtype if you ask me hmm is for making hearts well thank you for the donation and no it's very easy it's pretty okay I guess let's just program this thing see where it goes I don't know the exact full things is gonna be yet but let's see so the wrestler should get this flag here oh this is where you grab the object interesting wait so Reznor doesn't have a hitbox at all interesting okay in that case I guess the fuck this whole thing hello Sun Murray studios can you maybe you know zero a presses you very much doubt that can you turn this and messed up like I guess an article see no it helps if you want to do more complicated stuff it's definitely good but you don't need it yeah if you get with logic you don't actually need to have any math logic and math knowledge to be able to do like the basics of programming right if you want to just be like a script writer you can do that without any math experience I should have just programmed this as a like 3f oh well it's gonna compile this for the same I'm pretty sure so it doesn't really matter this is also just a single object code I usually don't hyper optimize single object codes like this I'm just gonna make sure they work well enough but you can say make a game with unity and real math yes the British are here let's go runs for a while in bunny rush but still really how long is that like four milliseconds it's kind of almost nothing considering we have 33 milliseconds by the way did you buy one of those amazing MIPS plushes no I didn't I don't really buy things I gotta save up so we can eventually get a house there's a there's a MIPS plush 5.5 is nothing these GCC vector extensions at all I don't really know much about compilers so I don't know what a vector extension is I mean we do have some GCC tricks let me let me show you let me just find the file right you can see a bunch of GCC tricks that we use here this was easy as pi's idea on my discord server to use like imaginary numbers here and now that I have this I can return two numbers at once in my thing too we use stuff like this but I don't know what a vector extension would do for us that girl in the background is my sister-in-law I'm your wife I'm not your sister-in-law that makes you my sister-in-law no it doesn't yes I have a I'm a big sucker for plushies no Lilaa don't do it I prefer the term wife thank you very much so I'm his wife I use vex extension to return multiple values by register not sure if MIPS AV has the trouble though no MIPS can only return one value by register unless you use the complex numbers trick there that I just showed that that's like the only way I know I know that you can like set up values that are just stored in registers I'm his wife not his sister-in-law like this or this was a thing to do but this is not ideal this is causing GCC to get tripped up and that's a big issue it causes it to generate a bunch of extra instructions everywhere else so I don't really know how to return multiple values in one function gotta go gamers the stomach is calling well good shit eventually I plan to make my own game here by the way so I think I'm picking up also might need some special code here so that's a good variable name I think 250.f should be enough and vertically we probably don't need to offset him at all so I'm just going to use zero for now I do Mr. Cool Dude but I'm doing animation right now hmm you can return to 16-bit values in a 30-bit register with vector extensions well you can do that without vector extensions so that's kind of useless we got married in February of last year November man so oh nice Nathan dude Nathan even if you replay the demo the final game is going to be near unrecognizable so you're not going to spoil yourself really so no Lilaa no this is not how it works okay so he should just be holding Bowser now and then when you release him nothing should happen there's also no animation yet what you can spin him already I didn't think you could does he need one where he's being held by his tail yes you know what I'm having a little trouble with the walk I'm gonna get that one done now Because it's a lot easier. Does your current build feel much different to playing on Pages of Fury? Have any of the optimization you've made since Infector Maru's physics feel? There have been some new optimization- no, improvements. One thing that really changes feel is that you can long jump out of the long jump land like this. That's a huge change to game feel. And you can jump out of like a triple jump land like this. All I got off this land here. And I guess the aerial kicks are a bit different. Oh wait, this is where the spinning is. Nevermind, the spinning's all good. Does your current build feel much different to playing on Pages of Fury?  This looks a bit strange, but maybe because I'm used to this retroface. Maybe. Yes, the PS1 had much higher res textures. Does your current build feel much different to playing on Pages of Fury? Does your current build feel much different to playing on Pages of Fury? The angle goes to zero here. So this is a frame too late. Unless... We set... What else do we have other than action timer? Action state. Then we can use this variable here. What velocity did they give Bowser usually is what I'm wondering. Let's find out. I can see the red lines he didn't know. I don't know how to fix Intellisense. I don't really care that much. I mean it's annoying, but it's workable. When does it actually release Bowser? I'm planning on replacing the body brush theme with a sequenced version.  No. No. There's your ball. Literally, I cannot see where it sets Bowser's velocity. It sets it every frame. Okay, we'll just copy this. Wait, that's a thing? As soon as the swing speed is more than 90, it just goes crazy? I was not aware of that. Well, this is the actual math they used. Why would it be this though? Why are they doing such weird shit when they have apps off? I don't know. Why divide it by 30,000? 3,000? This is just a conversion factor that Mario64 uses. Angle velocity is very high because 360 degrees is 65,536 coordinates. Am I a fan of robot? I don't want to call myself a fan of anything. That sounds so submissive. Oh god, he moves in 30 FPS. Uh oh. Why does he move in 30 FPS? He is gone. The spikes on Bowser's ship. Oh, those. Hmm. Honestly, that's a fair point. Making him darker might make Bowser stand out more. Fro-Matrix moment? I don't know if that's a Fro-Matrix moment. I don't know if that's a Fro-Matrix moment. I think this is a vanilla code interfering with my own code moment. Yep, right here. I think that's it. What's the point of actionArc equals zero? Boom. Which one was it? I don't know. Because the not pushing ones are the ones that set their own behavior and stuff. Can you watch Mario movie on stream right now in front of everyone? I hate the Peach's Peach's song. Why didn't he give it real lyrics? Why does he just repeat one word? I like the Mario movie, I just don't like the Peach's song. Pain. Hmm. Let me make sure the resnort still works fine. Oh, hello Kazama. Hello. Oh man, the resnort is desperately need lighting in the world. Holy shit. That's definitely a moment. I know why this is happening. This is because of some refactors we did. They might also need new animations that kind of look serious. Look, if you refactor a lot of codes, you have to expect stuff to break. It's no big deal. It doesn't take long to just fix. Okay, bet in the tip. Yep, right here. It's literally all. Yeah, they are very old models. This is course six. This is when I kind of just made all the animations myself and I had to make them real quick. If. There's no good brain damage. Rip.  I can do the animations. I don't think he wants to, but don't worry. We have Zaina doing some animations. I might redo some animations. Then there is enough people doing animations now. My animation slave in the background.   I mean, animations are fun for me. And if you saw the last, uh, the last animation I posted in the discord server. Bowser getting hit. That was a pretty good one. And the 64 megabyte limit does affect us. It affects us music wise. Currently, the ROM is 44.6 megabytes and 32.1 megabytes is music because we have a lot of stream to music. A stream music performs better. It sounds better, but it's giant file size wise. I am doing Bowser right now. Lila. My, my original plan was to do the bunnies until I saw that Bowser was just the Roomba on the ship. Yeah. So. Doesn't look too pretty right now. Now this is also good because it gets me animation practice. If I wanted a job in animation. Thank you, Lila. I appreciate that. It's very good practice for you. Oh, yeah. And it's portfolio building and you like it. So perfect. And that's going to give you the most feedback possible. That's honestly the fastest way to learn. Mm hmm. I'm not going to let Ike hold me back. I quit. It's Chinese. I'm just going to have to live with that. Man. Okay, what if you just make nothing happen here? Why would releasing Bowser do all these things to him? Oh, wait. What the fuck is this? Held angle pitch. I didn't even see this variable. Move angle pitch. That's zero. But that doesn't really. What is it? Same as moving a pitch. Oh. It just hits the face angle. I see. That's the face angle to the angle. Well. All right. All right. We can work with this. Yeah. You know what I think could be really interesting to just have like an infinitely generated game world. That's just generated from a C that it's just infinite in every direction. Use AI to make sure that there's actually content. And then you just throw a million players at it. It's just going to be a second world. And it's all going to be Mario. We're going to live in the Mario Matrix. Or this is what I keep saying. Imagine if you use Chachapiti to make the next Skyrim successful. Because like Bethesda, they would do that. The game's already scuffed as fuck. So imagine Chachapiti Skyrim with like infinite content and all of its goofy AI generated shit. Good. That is such an annoying question to keep being asked. That ban was deserved. You broke the one rule. The one rule in my chat is do not get banned.  It might make sense to just debug print the values here. Because some clearly funky stuff is going on. What I can say is that if you get banned, you will not be able to chat anymore. No comment. So forgive me if this is a big question. But has the CPU ever been a bottleneck when you make ROM hack? Yes. If you have huge dynamic objects like a flying ship, for example, with a lot of polygons, that might be an issue on the CPU. But with all the optimizations and RTYI, that's not going to be the bottleneck anymore. Hello, GS64. How much experience do you have? I've been making ROM hack for like 10 years now. There's no way it's just deleting the object, right? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did I even set the subtype here? I don't think I did. I think all of this is happening because I forgot to set this. Yep. That also explains why I was punching the ResNor. Why was it difficult to do that? You know what, while we're at it, I'm going to update the ResNor real quick. I can't stand its unshaded face. Yeah, Mario's going to get a new animation format in that Lilaa's making. And that's going to fuck a lot of shit up here, too. I don't mind just breaking a bunch of stuff. It means the game is going to be better forever. Whatever. Guys, don't worry, I know what this looks like, but this all makes sense. He is darker than I thought he would be. That's a bummer. And that's not the lighting I want. What's your favorite romhack? Peach's Fury. My own. Got fucked. Yeah, I picked my own. I guess my favorite. Hmm, I actually think I have to turn this around. Oh, this is missing the print color input. Why is that one so dark though? Oh, that's why. What did I mess up? Why is this so dark in comparison? Huh. Kinda looks terrible right now. But that might just be the blender preview. That's a lot better. Huh. No vertex alpha painting. There's vertex alpha painting. No. Why would I do that? It will just give me garbage. That's an insane man's idea. This file is so old that I didn't have my repo on the Z-Drive yet. Holy shit. I am not intentionally adding GBJ, but I am not promising that there won't be a 1. Yeah, if you have world light in your thing, then the whole thing is going to be a bit more Okay, some things are seriously wrong here. Oh, I have an idea why. I forgot to set the render modes for 2-cycle. There we go. They're also kind of really dark and then there's also this being a thing. Okay. I think that might just be a blender thing. You should put your face cam in the upper right corner. That's kind of weird. There's something weird going on with the rotation it's receiving for sure. Also, the lighting in this level might be too dark. What is going on with the rotation? Both had the same issue. It's way too dark. It is very dark. That might just be the level lighting. Oh, wait. Wait, I know why it's so dark. Wait, what the fuck? I love how we go from working on the Bowser level again to fixing the Resnor. Yeah, and you have to fix random stuff sometimes. Fine. Now he's brighter. Hashtag BT, bro. It knows better than you. Sure. Yeah. So this one doesn't even set its position to Mario's. It's angled to Mario's. Okay. I think this is because of the grabbed object rendering thing. And because when you grab an object, there is some special code running. So... The geo held object thing. It's not this one. This one. I think the issue for me with Twitch is still just the ads. But like 80% of people on Twitter also voted YouTube. It's too bad they aren't here right now. Okay. Oh. Wait. No, this should do it fine. Okay. Bro is the thinker. I am the thinker. This should be our move angle pitch. Yep. And just for the test, let's try this here. See if that fixes it. If that fixes it, then we know the bug is here. That did not help at all. Cool. I don't care about Mario attacks. How is this not it? I don't want to pull off the debugger. Don't make me pull out the debugger. Please. Okay. The crazy part is that they seem to completely ignore what Mario is doing. Like entirely. Okay. But you get banned from being insanely annoying and you keep being annoying. I know you're young, but like. He'll bring up something and no one wants to talk about it. Like just stop. Okay. Okay. Let's just remove all this. We're just going to remove a bunch of health object sets until we find the one that's fucking this up.  Did not mean to do this. But now it's doing the thing. So it is this piece of code that's fucking it up. So for some reason. This is giving the wrong angle to Mario. And to the object. I'm not sure where it does that. I mean, this is some crack code. Be right back. It might just be that you can't actually read object fields like this. That would really suck. I was not planning to support Android, but it might just randomly work on Android. I mean, look, I might have hurt his feelings just now, but he's going to learn from it, right? This is like a lesson that he has to learn in this life. No, it doesn't. Yeah, it's got to be this part here. Something about this is not doing the thing I needed to do. Well, I mean, this part. But wait, didn't I? Did she test this just now? And it also didn't work. Is something going wrong with the Delta current rot? I mean, the most important part of streaming is that I'm having fun, because if I'm having fun, then I'm going to be in a positive mood and the stream is going to be more fun for everyone. So someone's pissing me off. They just have to call them out on it. I do have to enjoy streaming as well after all. Okay, you guys don't need to hate on him that much. I think he gets it. Wait, when I removed this, it just started working and didn't it? Because if it does work, then that is very weird. Okay. What the fuck? I have returned. Oh, and I brought you a snack. Oh, nice. Just put it down. All right, there we go. Oh, I guess it applies to Delta current rot before it applies to move angle. So these three have to be wrong. I don't want to change the way this code works, because this is very optimal. If it worked fine, I just made the dumb mistake somewhere. I'm guessing or the compiler is just not working this out the way I want. Let's try something else. I do have a YouTube channel. I've been posting animations there recently. Can I throw my YouTube channel in the chat? Sure. Let me just check that this doesn't bloat code too much. 2808, the segment, and now it's 2854. 0x4Cbytes extra for this. Oh, yeah, that guy is being annoying. So this copies the angle properly, doesn't it? The translation is all wrong now, but... Oh, well, no, the angle was off by 40 degrees. Let me try this with Mario. I'll eat the chocolate you brought me. Wait, what? Why is this off by 90 degrees? Okay. Thanks for the subs, guys. Appreciate it. Zaina's job here is animations and artwork. So if I may, Kaze, every month you'll see a new animation posted. It's just, well, mainly just a collection of animations. So look forward to seeing Bowser's showcase next. Something about this Mario state code is very weird. We find the motivation to work. Why do you need motivation? Just do it. No, the angle is right. It's just the direction of offset is wrong. Ah, yes, Nintendo president Gary Bowser has been sent to jail. Bowser's in jail, true. Yeah, there's something weird about the Mario states thing. So long, Gary Bowser. Okay, so it looks like this is always setting the offset and we don't actually need to set this right here. We should be setting it right here. Oh, what's my job outside the project? I am currently a kitchen cook and I hate kitchens. I hate it. Actually, that's not entirely true. I have a good team to work with right now. Do I have Napoleon? Is that a Ligma? That's a Ligma. You're not getting me. I am the ultimate master chef. Okay, so I can use that. That shit's a bit weird, but like, fine. Is it not instantly set? No, it instantly sets it to act releasing browser. So I don't really see why there's a delay like that. Whatever. That doesn't matter for now. Why is the translation off? Then we had to kill you. Sometimes things don't go quite as planned right away. Oh, I know why. It's because the coordinates here are. No, actually, that doesn't make any sense. Okay, maybe it does make sense. Because Mario's model is rotated in the weirdest fucking way. So there is a chance that I have to invert the X and Z axis. I might even have to set X to minus Z for this to work correctly. No old seagull, but we did have two Yoshis as our ring bearers. And yes, I did take them when we went to see the Mario movie. Why am I getting hit by the thing? That is weird. You should not be having. That you should be tangible. Okay. Okay. Actually, how many lines of code is the game if you happen to know? I don't know. Probably like 100,000. I'm not sure. Actually, 100,000 sounds like a lot. Last impact was like 100,000 when it was done. Oh, actually, considering this file is already like 2,800. Maybe 100,000 is such a bad guess. Maybe even 200,000. Height of code is kind of a bad measurement because you can make really long lines of code. You can make the entire game in a single line of code if you really want to. It'd be a bad idea, but you could. Okay, so Resnor is no longer offset. But there's other things I don't like. For one, I don't like that the Delta Current Pass is being set because that makes him animate in 30 FPS. For two, there is now the worry I have that in this level here, the trash can that you can pick up is going to be wrong. It was made long before Role Manager was even a thing. I wish it was made on Role Manager. Okay, this looks good. Your English seems pretty good. Kek Honka Honka. Thank you. Kek Honka Honka. What? Why do you say Kek Honka Honka after a perfectly normal sentence? What is wrong with you?  Kek Honka Honka. Oh, probably this is happening because the held object is still attached. That's why. Got it. Oh, there's a guy called Kek Honka Honka in chat. I thought you just said a normal sentence and then went Kek Honka Honka. Kek Honka Honka. I have not looked into BTTV emotes in this yet. I would love to enable them if I knew how. You need the Rambo stick for your job. Do you work in computer repair or something? It'd be very funny to just slap that stick on. No, you don't have to be worried about that with Dcomp. That is much more likely to happen without Dcomp. In Dcomp you can press Ctrl-Z. Without Dcomp, you make one mistake, your entire ROM's gone. Can link your YouTube with your BTTV. Oh, I don't actually have a BTTV account. Okay. Okay, so we got the throw in. We have Reznor fixed. Everything's good. Next up, we have to make it so that Bowser starts sliding. We need to increase like a thing here. And then we just, whenever there's friction occurring, we spawn some dust particles. Macro Ankh 1.8 is perfectly fine with me. Actually, we already have one we can use here. And then we just need to make it so that Bowser starts sliding.  We'll use this. What do we use for Reznor? Oh, the same protocol. Yep, this works. Wait, that's not it. Where's the dust trail when he stops running? Dust backwards, fine. Gotta poop, bye. Bye, LeapLegends. See ya. This is gonna be a much bigger deal than Lost Impact. Lost Impact, this is a game that wasn't really beloved by everyone. I think this one's gonna be different. I think everyone's gonna love this game and that's gonna make its popularity skyrocket. Actually, I'm gonna use Action 18, can I honka honka? I'm so sorry to keg honka honka, but I love saying that. Yeah, most Mario 64 mods are all 64 megabytes because that's what the tools do. They just extend it to 64. And then they have hardcoded addresses where they just shit into. In reality, out of those 64 megabytes, most of the time, only 64 megabytes. Only like 10 are used. I have not worked on the Banjo-Kazooie mod. I don't like Banjo-Kazooie. I haven't even beaten the games. No, if I'm making my own game, I'm just gonna use Unreal Engine. I'm actually a professional developer in Unreal Engine already. I get paid a lot for that. A lot more than for Mario 64 modding. So just switching to Unreal for real games would be very easy for me. But I don't like about Banjo-Kazooie. I'm very picky with games. And for me, Banjo-Kazooie is just kind of boring. There's nothing that really stands out to me that I hate about it. It's just kind of eh. There's many of those, all my servers set up to single ms because it's a safe bet. Now what they did is, so we had the tools and the tools would just make the ROM 64 megabytes. And they would just write 010101 into the entire ROM for like at least like 40 megabytes. And then like every three megabytes into the ROM, there would be one level. And the three megabytes between the levels, it's just going to be zero ones with nothing in it. So if your level is like 200 kilobytes, there's going to be 2.8 megabytes of just zero one. So the 64 megabyte is kind of misleading because they were not actually 64 megabytes of content. I have not played Pizza Tower yet. I don't really like too many games. I said I'm very picky with games. I think Yu-Gi-Oh! Dual Transfer was the first game that we played that you really liked in a while. Yeah. I mean, I think it's because the deck building was really fun. It's like Yu-Gi-Oh! online, but better. Yeah. Because you don't have to pay for any. The only thing you have to pay for, for the booster packs, is with money you earn in-game. Yeah, I wouldn't pay for Yu-Gi-Oh! stuff. Yeah. It was fun making a pretty... What would you call our Exodia deck? It's kind of troll. Torture. Especially if you get lucky on a first turn. I want the level design to be creative and or the movement to be engaging and interesting. Yeah, Banjo-Kazooie isn't really about platforming. Banjo-Kazooie is about adventure and exploring. For me, what's really important in a platformer is that I get that sense of freedom. That sense of skill expression. Did you think Yooka-Laylee was better than Banjo-Kazooie? No, Yooka-Laylee is dogshit. It's funny because you liked it for the first little bit that we played. Yeah, but it turned so awful. And yet, we still beat the game 100%. They have a palace in Yooka-Laylee that is so bad. That is so much worse than everything else in the game. I think that was something that we should have done better. Someone put their kit on to make it level. And then the rest of the team was just forced to do that. I do like Yooka-Laylee for what it is, but it's very flawed. He is right about that. So it should be possible to beat the entire fight now. But obviously a lot of animations are missing and a lot of stuff is missing. Yes, I think that's the ice palace. Or no, the isometric palace. I think that's what they called it. Yeah, the isometric palace was dogshit. Do we want to make a Sonic Adventure mod? Sonic Adventure sounds like a very cool game to mod. Do you think it would be a hard test to mod Sonic Adventure? It depends on the tools other people already developed. I really, really liked Sonic Adventure 1 and 2. They are still in my favorite games of all time. I'm thinking of making this turning maybe a bit faster. Oh, that looked cool. Oh, I missed it. So after you hit Bowser, Bowser jumps over and you just have to show him off. There we go! That's one way to show him off. That's not how I expected this to happen. He just goes... You know those ice blocks you have to move in Ocarina of Time? It's like that, but with Bowser. Home strike. Yeah, I actually really like the knuckle stages in Sonic Adventure games too. It's based off the old one, but with new textures and stuff. So I modeled the new Bowser model. Please help me tweak it. We made new textures, we made new textures.  New facial textures, the geometry, new geometry. He doesn't look as dismembered as the old one. Albeit, I guess the old one was easier to animate. Yeah, the old one kind of holds everywhere. I can show this model real quick. That's Resnor. So we gave him a new rig. The old rig was kind of unworkable. He has some higher res textures here. He has world shadings. I painted these all myself. I'm not a fan of the shell texture, which I might redo when I have some time. Didn't I reduce the resolution of this one? Yes, you did. Why is this... Did you not save it? That's the wrong model. Here, this is the model. I thought I deleted the wrong one. I should do that right now. This is actually around 70 triangles less. A few higher res textures and a better rig. And that's his throne. You don't need that. Please don't type boxes at me. That guy might just be saying some insanely racist stuff. None of us would know. What if the Chinese bots are attacking me because I'm not supporting the Aequa? Can't Conquer Honka should be an emote if you ever link BTTV to YouTube? True. It should just be one of the clowny emotes. And I just realized that I don't have the right Bowser model either. What? I sent it to you. You sent it to me this morning and I opened one that you sent me yesterday. Can't Conquer Honka. Dane. What? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dude, maybe he's actually cursing my entire bloodline for modding Japanese games because that's illegal in Japan. What if that's what he's doing? He's saying take it home for a tax scholarship. I think it just means picking up the tip of a pen. Actually, TJ makes an H on his finish. He's laughing. I know, but I think it's way funnier to read it as JJ. So I think I have one issue with the Soul Fight and that is that this face here is boring as fuck. There should be something you can do to speed up that face. Oh shit, I'm not in the moment Petrie I only do it for K's right now, but if someone were to approach me and ask I'd probably do it If the project is if the project looks interesting, of course you get enough work here You give me you give me an endless amount of work here. I Don't think K's is a one to share are you well, I mean We kind of silly We gotta make the money. We're gonna make those bucks. That is true. That is true. I Mean if somebody also paid me to do it, I'd say yes Why are the eggs floating the balloons Yoshi balloons, they're helping the ship stay afloat Yeah, true seagulls I haven't done all the effects yet and as you can see and this is not there yet either I Thanks need some baked and shading true I Don't know Frank, I mean it's gonna be like at least another year before it just comes out It's always nice to have like a hobby that also makes money My youtube learns like a slight bits my patron is like the biggest income But like it's nice knowing that even if I lost my job I wouldn't just starve The spikes finally la we will take a look at the spikes So, what do you want do you want this all to be darker is that what you're saying I Looks alright reda. Yeah, I Concussed bird for they it's like 140p. They have to shit on the resolution just for the game to run fine Maybe both I should just have like an additional light on them I Also need to make so that if Mario falls down here he doesn't instantly die you should just respawn Above on the background elements. I agree that it's not very pretty I Let me check something Wait, that doesn't make any sense Why are they popping in I Mean they have to start existing somewhere, right? Now there are a few n64 games that just completely scrunched or solution I Would we hide the pop in on the background elements is my question I guess I actually guess we could do a scale in I'll give a scale in a try. I Love how the rocket looks like with this effect Heat He Didn't reset his position I Wish I'd be able to spend full time on it It was a full-time project when I started it, but I got a job around half a year ago You Can use mist don't you? We can use fog. Yes, but we'd have to do separate fog planes that all like Fade into the background and that would be very like you on n64 The problem with alpha transparency too is that the vertices aren't really sorted So the ship wouldn't look right could make that work on the balloons but not the ships Let's Try this I guess We don't need to do this Yeah, I just kind of use random variables, I don't really care how they're named Actually don't need this on the penis health we just need it on these ones here Let's Try it It's not gonna use us to have a touch linked on the users. Don't you think true? That is gonna go I Definitely pop in less but you can very clearly see what's happening. That's not really good I Think and disappear in the same way We Do this and then on top of that we're gonna make it so that I Can't How about we just make the spawn a bit behind And then here When the scale is not the same we could move it by a percentage of the scale so it doesn't look us jarring I have an error somewhere. Oh All right, there should be less pop any Calorie all the broth You have made it to the stream That Ship is inverted That ship is not inverted why was one ship inverted but the other one wasn't I know why I Could use a sprite and distance and change it to a model and it's close. Yeah, but that's gonna look even worse Oh Shit what is that? Well, what is going on there? How did that happen? Oh, I see So so I This will do it Yeah, I have to use a negative scale because the ships are only half modeled so what I do is I use a negative scale and I Turn on front face culling and turn off back face culling So that way in the ship only is like about half the amount of polygons No, no I know what's wrong. I don't even need to test again. I don't know exactly what to do Yeet The sponsor fight is hard I Might just add some coins here so you can get health back. I Also have to make it so that he faces Mario afterwards, obviously guys He's gonna just jump off now, isn't he Goodbye cruel world. I am done This is the breath of the wild OST I There we go, those are turning stuff to fight Make sense Okay, so when using a capsule instead of a cylinder improve performance at all since capsule is just a sphere collision along the line A capsule is a sphere and a sphere and a cylinder So that is more because now you have two spheres This is in the main course itself So I don't like that when you throw Bowser you from down like that But I don't see why you would be from down at all here It makes no sense Because if you look at Cinex It's this the angle is like here Unless there's something about writing it I'll even just lose the channel points. So we'll just tell me not to use up the remaining show points. I don't know The capsule is just a line with one sphere and uses the point closest to other objects along line and then sphere collision at that point It still sounds slower than Another it's an unrotated cylinder Right a capsule could be like a rotator line. I actually do have Like points I Guess I would be in this part here. That's a lot more than just getting the square root of two angle differences to axis differences And this is basically what it takes so It's a lot more I Think doing a cylinder and two spheres would be less than that. I Can't see your sad face Hello Carter, I am glad you think that You Know why it's descending him down. It really shouldn't I Also realized that this should probably be its own separate case because if it isn't then You might set your action state to something weird And that would be good What do you think of this YouTube emoji beautiful As you can get creative and just stylized apartments on I know it's a dumb example, but fortnight used to do that I Do have stylized poppin, but obviously if I can prevent it I Want to know good at all the stylized pop and I have is that if an animated actor is too far away and zone in 64 he comes out of the ground and goes up and down like a cartoon pop-up effect And But I have to enable poppin specifically on the actress that I want that to be on I Mean a good thing. You reminded me of poppin because I already kind of forgot And almost just didn't fix this now ships. I'm wrong on both sides aren't there It's wrong there Whoops Can I get a shit on this yeah, okay Okay, now it's fixed So Next up we need both animations We need to give both a jump back onto his thing here, which will have to happen with Also an animation I think going jumps from the floor or he would be pulled up by a lucky to maybe I Think being pulled up by a lucky to would be really cool after you shoot them down Just because that is very bows. I like I Just gonna do this I Don't want to do that. I'll fix this later. We're done for today though. I hope you enjoyed this I will be back next Saturday So don't miss it if you want to see how this keeps going and I'll see you guys in the next stream. Bye. Bye
