Hello? It is streaming time. We gotta make craps today. Oh my god, the Mario Kart 8 crap is perfect. Hello, TinyMan. Hello, Selton. Hello, Dainty. Man, I'm feeling so exhausted today for no good reason. Where is D-A-E? Oh, Kolada. Right. Hello, TinyMan. That looks perfect, holy shit, that's very nice. So we were thinking these crabs would spawn in and bother the fish, but now that I look at this, I'm not really sure how this would work, how would you attack the crab and stuff like that. I haven't started Mario 64 hacking today, guess I was too busy with other things. I was making a new video because I have a new sponsor. I finished my camera refactors yesterday. Hello, Mr. Comet. Okay, Mr. Comet, usually I don't agree with Arthur when he makes fun of you for your bad humor, but like, come on. Oh, we should get Luigi out. Luigi stream is over. I was surprised to see how much people hated this Luigi model last stream. Hello, Piccolos. Someone actually DMed me on Twitter offering to voice Luigi, so let's give him a shot. Right, we finished programming the fish yesterday. Still need to animate them. Nevermind, we didn't finish programming them. There were a few things left to do, like preventing this. But I want to do the crab, if we're even going with the crab. I'm still so torn on this. The idea was that eventually the crab would show up, and they'd be circling the fish, and you have to beat the crabs to free the fish, and that gives you a star, and then the fish like you, and they give you a hint on how to access a secret level. Ugh, god, I'm so tired today. Yeah, the problem with the crab model is that they don't look like you can ground-punch a shell, and their claws would retract into it. So that idea is probably off the table. But also I'm still considering turning these guys 3D, because these look very shitty. So if we just went with this model, that might be a good idea. I might want to reduce the triangle counts on this a little bit, but I think we should go with this model. That's probably also going to save us a little bit of RAM in this level, so that's a plus in my book. It is a little bit frivolous to have such a small actor be a full 3D model, but I think it is the right choice. What is the hotkey again for looking around? I thought it was shift-tilt. It is shift-tilt, though. What was I pressing before? You get to add in the crab anthem and dancing crabs? What? Oh, you got to. I don't have to do shit. I think we can get him down to like 150 triangles, which would make this perfectly reasonable in my book. Or send groundhunting weasel, but it didn't really make sense to push life-restituting crabs around, so I replaced them with wood signs. Wait, what? How does it make sense to push around wood signs? You don't know what you are cooking? Oh, fair enough. What am I doing? Go here. I don't know what is going wrong here. It should be over here. Okay, there we go. Okay, that makes more sense. That one still doesn't make any sense. That's a little better, I think. Also, an American could never dream of having this many polygons. That's genuinely true. Just could not. By hitting G three times, you can make it automatically move the UVs as they would move if you moved the vertices there normally. That's a very useful feature. Fun fact. 178. That's better. That one kind of does a lot for the visuals. Maybe we can... I think that's a valid trade-off. Shift V and then G. Shift V. Okay, I've never used that one. I think hitting G three times is a bug, but it's a bug that I like to use because it makes my workflow faster. What the fuck? This is a weird texture, is it not? I knew it. What the fuck? Oh my god. I thought I would take mostly place in Blender. Well, it depends on what you're doing, right? If you're programming, then there's no Blender. But of course, there's a lot of 3D modeling involved because you need to make that out somehow. Okay, we are at 170 without any significant visual regressions. This one should be completely reducible. 164. I guess the bigger problem here would be bone count in the end. And we need to index the texture. Shit. Oops. This is from a video. This is garbage. What is Blender doing? What is GIMP doing? This is trash. This is a lie. This graph is a lie. This is nonsense. GIMP? Buddy? Are you okay? What the fuck? It looks like Mr. Krabs, doesn't it? It makes sense. Okay, I might already write that. Oh, that's rough. I can't do that. That looks too terrible. I think we have to retexture the crab. Okay, I think we have to go with a different approach for the crab altogether, maybe. This is... It's rough. I don't think we can do this. Okay. And so, the way they value their polygons, I really don't like it. Like, I feel one polygon extra here is very appropriate. Do we even want this, though? I feel that the 2D crabs we have in the overworld are just not appropriate. But if we made bigger crabs that attack, we need to put in some way to defeat them. How do you defeat these crabs in Mario Kart? Do you defeat them in Mario Kart? Also, this texture is not going to work. You like the 3D version? I like the 3D version, too. It's just that what we have here, texture-wise, is not going to work. How do you defeat these crabs in Mario Kart? This is not the one I mean. This is the one I get. I want this crab. This is way cooler. Okay, what do you guys say? We say, fuck it. We remove this entire crab. And we 3D model this one. Side-step a crab? Maybe? This crab is way cooler. And you can ground-pound it to make it hide itself or something. The black-faced crab? Yeah. The one that's hiding in the shadows. I much prefer that. Yeah, fuck this crab. We're making a new one. Hello, arrow! Start on me. I think about this size, comparatively speaking, works well. I don't think it's seen a Disney movie. Well, it's from Mario Kart, it's not from a Disney movie. That didn't look bad. Well, it's because you didn't see the text just crunched down yet. But the last one is also just fairly inefficient for the N64, so I just do not like it for that reason as well. Okay, bilateral symmetry. Hello, Vigilator. Vigilarua. Going to be where the eyes are. I think this works, right? Am I missing something? Overall, the shape is a lot more spiky, I notice. It's more like this shape here. Compare. Yep, that looks about right to me. The 2D crap is not great, though. We are on the N64. Putting in 2D anything is such an insult. What do you mean? We marketed this as the 3D console and then we're putting in 2D enemies? Come on. On the N64, man, the days of 2D are over. They take us for a loser, a schmuck. How many legs do crabs have? Six? Two? Two. Four. Sorry, not two. Definitely not two. Two on each side. Well, there's going to be a big version of them, too. That, like, come and fuck your day up. So it's not going to be an issue, I think. It's almost like they are schmucks. They're losers. They cannot make their stuff 3D, even though this is the console that was advertised as the 3D console. Almost like that's what I was criticizing. Or playing at, rather. 6 and 2 closer to the 8, because there's going to be an evolution tree like spiders, but you're not sure. But there's many different kinds of crabs, right? And a lot of things called crabs are not really crabs. So I'm not sure where exactly these guys fall on the evolutionary tree. Kind of like this is good. 10 legs? What? How many legs do crabs have? Five pairs of legs? Why do crabs have 10 legs and not 8 legs and 2 arms? What? Why the king crab is not a crab and then it's a crab with 6 legs? What do you mean? Where's 10? 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3. Oh my god. The arms are considered legs. We give scientists too much power. We shouldn't be like, um, actually they attach on the L2 vertebrae, therefore they are not arms, but rather legs. No, they're like, it fucking looks like arms. It's arms. It looks like arms, man. It's arms. Whales are fish. Sharks are not. And neither are manta rays. Or seahorses. Fuck you. We give scientists too much power. We shouldn't be listening to them like that. Arms and legs are not anatomical words. They are like colloquial words that describe anatomy. There, I said it. They don't need to match with some evolution bullshit. They just need to match with what the fuck we see. Because otherwise, if we can't use words like that, we can't talk at all. Do I need to, like, know the evolution history of a chair to call it a chair? No! I bet some chairs evolved from non-chairs. And we still call them chairs. Monkey can grab stuff with their feet. Are they arms? No. I can grab stuff with my feet. We are fish. That's slightly true. Something about these legs feels wrong. I'm looking at crab images. Are they too short? Is the body not tall enough? This looks like a portal enemy. The crabs seem to achieve the crab legs. Yo, Autodidact. Happy Halloween. Is a chair means it needs to be its main purpose? Almost everything I've said so far is a chair. See? This is the power we gave scientists. There was a study that concluded that one third of all scientific studies set synopses that drew conclusions in opposition to the data and research method. But we're at what? I see. Well, I was just talking about the power on colloquial words. Still pisses me off that whales aren't fish, but sharks are. Somehow. Evolutionary chair? Okay, look. Chairs maybe didn't have a biological evolution, but they had an ideological evolution. Alright? Someone made a chair once, and then someone else was like, oh, that looks neat, but we've made this modification. Someone put a stump on the floor, and they were like, that's the first chair. That's the common ancestor of every chair, is the stump on the floor. And then someone was like, hmm, what if we added back support? What if we added this off the floor so barks don't crawl up our chairs? What if we added cushions? This is the evolution of a chair. And then some things evolved from non-chairs, like a rock on the floor. Alright, that's kind of a chair. But it didn't evolve from, you know, this tree stump. Currently 5 to 1. Well, we're going for this crap here. The ratio is supposed to be quite off. It just still doesn't feel right. I think it's because these are supposed to be further in, maybe? Like so? Maybe? You think a rock would be the first chair? Okay, let's make a rock the common ancestor of all chairs. But then, like, how did it evolve? Like, oh, stone's nice, but what if we had wood? Wouldn't that be softer? But also, what if structure is the same thing? I mean, did bats evolve from chairs? Oops, I didn't mean to close that. Adding a clause would certainly help. You think just adding the clause would fix it completely? We can try it. I don't want to be influenced by the horrid abomination on the right. Okay. Is this an almond shape? Is this not an almond shape? That's very almond-y to me. But maybe I'm crazy. Life comments for grammar? Like, what I say is what I say, just grammatically wrong sometimes. That could be very true. My speech skills have, like, deteriorated a lot over time for some reason. I used to be so fluent in my language. But I suppose spending four years alone in a room without talking kind of murdered that. But I had the romech to make, so it was worth it. That's better. He looks like SpongeBob with a karate arm right now. Still looks fucked up to me. Biomech's going to look at this and be like, has he ever seen a crab in his life? These crabs have two scissors that are of the same size, so we will not be making one size bigger than the other. I don't have a tail and wag it like a happy dog. Interesting. I don't have a tail and wag it like a happy dog. Interesting. I don't have a tail and wag it like a happy dog. That's better now. I don't have a tail and wag it like a happy dog. I don't have a tail and wag it like a happy dog. I don't have a tail and wag it like a happy dog. Nice. If you want to work forward, they are not built to do it, but they absolutely can, and it's very entertaining. Should probably reduce a few more of these backside triangles. These feel like very cheap saves. They don't impact the overall quality of the model. In fact, this feels like we improved it. To me. So they're supposed to be like almost triangular at the top. Yeah. Yeah, now I see the vision. You seeing this? This is the goal. This is what we have. Oh, that feels good, actually. Oh, that feels right. Oh my God, that's perfect. Maybe we do this. Why no music? I didn't put any on. You want any music? Hello, be savory. It all seems like it should be a bit taller. Oh, yeah. When I compare this to the Mario Kart model, you are correct. But do we want it to be as tall as the Mario Kart model? I guess that's the question, too. I feel this would look weird. The nice way you don't upload the wads so your followers can see you like. The wads are preserved forever. They can see it whenever they want. Wait. Just go to the channel. Then click on lives. And they're all here. Every single one. Jet Grind Radio OST. Okay, fine. You liar. It's called Jet Set Radio. I don't see Jet Grind Radio. I'm thinking maybe it's tactically not smart of me to upload wads. Because what if Nintendo somehow tries to say that some of the stuff I'm using in my game is stolen from them? I feel like they would have so much ammunition to potentially find something. Oh, wow. I guess leaving the wads up would be a strong signal that I don't think I'm doing anything illegal. What's the right rotation here? 18? Oh, maybe Nintendo for discords. Hello, Kekitopu. Yes, and we're using the Mario Kart model or we're using the Mario Kart design as a base instead of the Mario Kart DS or whatever it was. I don't know. These eyes are rough to work with. That seems about right to me. Time to make textures for the crab. I'm actually very happy with how this turned out. It looks very accurate and it only took me a couple minutes to make. Yes. Actually, is that true? As ironic as it sounds, I don't feel like my favorite topic is myself. Well, it seems like a fairly safe assumption. Kind of an odd. It's completely true and testable. That's not testable. You said every person. Testing it for every person, have I? It is very hard to test. I mean, I suppose it is in theory possible to test, but it is very infeasible. There should be like a gradient here. But if you have a red pixel and a black pixel with a gradient, then we clamp it. Let's try that. I mean, we'll have you besides Biobank. This will be the texture on the crab. Maybe not quite. Doesn't look perfect yet. Oops. What is this song? Ooh. Yeah, I agree with that one. That seems very true. I like the part where he said every person. I was like, ah, every? Maybe 90% or maybe even 95. I was thinking this for the crab. How is that? I was kind of hoping for the transition to be way bigger. Yeah, like that. Would the rest people see a crab? What would the rest people do? The textures are not great yet, because the texture is wrong. The texture is the wrong size. Can you scale the middle vertices by zero to avoid z-fading so that they don't clip into each other? Where do you see z-fighting here? There's no z-fighting here, but where do you suspect z-fighting might happen? Oh. You mean this? Oh, you mean the two in the middle here? Oh. Okay, I see your worry, but no, this is not going to cause z-fighting, because they're the same color. But it's a good thing you brought this up, because I think we can remove these two triangles. If we just do this. So now, of course, z-fighting is going to... We can probably do... We can probably do this here. What the hell? Okay, it looks pretty bad to do that. Never mind. But we can probably just remove them, right? Like, okay, if someone looks into the crab body... Keep in mind, the crab is smaller than Mario. If someone manages to look at it from this angle into here and see the missing two triangles, I'm fine with that. I mean, okay, we can... I guess, shape-smoothing like this looks a little better. Yeah. The shades with the back of the eye. This part here is actually sharp. Okay, I think this would look a little better. If we did some texture wrapping from here. It shouldn't make a difference in the end, but I want this anyway. But also reduce... No, this will not reduce vertices. Never mind. We're not doing that. We're doing this. Okay, this looks very, very wrong right now. Maybe this should be marked sharp. Why does it look so wrong? No reflection. The highlights of the eyes should be on both sides then. Maybe. That might be a good point. When I'm applying the eye texture on the video shape, I'm putting a 2D texture in front of the video shape, so the eyes look round from the front. Yes, that's also possible. The shell looks so wrong. I need to do something about the shell. I can't deal with this. I think it needs to be darker, first of all. Something like this. Yes, that's also possible. I need to do something about the shell. I can't deal with this. I think it needs to be darker, first of all. Something like this. And it needs reflections. Okay, new enemy. This replaces the crabs we have, and it's going to be part of one mission. So, there's one really cool thing we can do here. And I need the exact RGB values of this for that. Okay. I fucking hate GIMP. Where did my everything go? Where did my everything go? What did I do? I just want to sample the RGB values here. Okay. Everything is gone. What the fuck? What the fuck? 9.5 Let's get scratching. Is this a little better with a little reflection? I think the reflection makes this a lot better. I have not tried Affinity yet. Boom. Let's make this an i8, not an RGBA. Alright, what's next on our little crabby here? The legs also need this material here, I think. But the legs need some sharp edges here. It's going to look real poopy. What the hell? Why is that? There we go. Still feels kind of terrible. I think I'm going to be a boon against this info. I don't know what you guys are talking about. Sounds like rain rot again. I think... Hot tank alert. Political streamers on Twitch and YouTube and political commentators. They are just the millennial version of brain rot. Gen Z goes 6, 7 and millennials go... There is this new drama. Hassan Darkcaller. Destiny something. I don't know. I think that's on the same level as 6, 7. Can I get a truant chat for everyone who agrees? I don't know. It's their job to say the same thing over and over. If they ever change their mind on something, it's part of their audience. It's quite literally their job to be stupid. Haha, you clicked on Rick Astley. You know what, that's true. You have a point. Maybe the politics streamer brain rot is not just millennials, it's everyone. It's coming from the guy who said whatever makes me more money. Am I the guy or who is the guy? You know what, at least I admit it. Ask any other streamer, they would be like no, my opinion is the morally superior one. Maybe a wavy tech chat would work for this. Every streamer is the guy, I know. Have you seen that family guy clip? Where it's like, this is harder than when I had to convince congress to go to war to Iraq. And Griffin just says, whoever doesn't want to go to war is gay. And everyone's like, oh my god, we should go to war. I wanted to go to war first, it was my idea. I forgot where I was going with this bit. He's trying to get to sleep. Is there a rap song that sounds like that? Jump, jump. Right, yeah, it goes like jump, jump, jump. Oh god, you guys are actually talking about politics. Cringe. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Oh, oh, oh. Sweet soul brother. Sweet soul. Easy, easy, easy. Sweet soul brother. Sweet soul brother. Sweet soul brother. Sweet soul brother. Is there an easy way to do like some fading here. You know what, I don't need that side, we only need a little bit of this actually. We'll do this. Let's fix in my world. It's simple labor. It's simple labor. They knew it out of the joy for the heart. Did he get anything? No one meant to be turned on. Wait, what? Is that the composer of the OST here? Where did my texture go? Sweet soul brother. I was thinking something like this. And then we just work between two colors. This might actually be easier to do with just one color here. Okay, fellas, I need some gimp help. I want a red layer and an orange layer. I want a red layer and a yellow layer. And I want the yellow layer to be faded in depending on how white it is. So surely I can just make a new layer. Paint it red. About the same red as the rest of the body was. Which was 9500. Make it big. Actually, it needs to be slightly brighter because it doesn't have a highlight. Make it slightly brighter. Then make another layer. Paint this one yellow. Hide these. Make this. Unhide this. Make this an alpha mask. Edit the layer mask. Put it there. what the fuck why is it not here oh my god that did something else I want this yes yes yes no it worked nice that's almost what we want this is most disturbing this is a game ost for jet set radio so a whole game studio made this there's a whole game with the ost you can play all right what do you think of my crap did we do a good job but those countries have animals as their symbols because people back then were furries and that was their fursona this is canon it happened you can't tell me the egyptians weren't furries why is there no cat on the egypt deck we have the memetics on the shell to make it more like the mario kart one memetics on the shell I mean I guess you could move it up a little bit oh the crab body looks deceptively dark in this field because there's this reflection here yeah if we really really want this to look more like the mario kart one we could definitely move this up it's even thinner on the mario kart one oh my god 56 baby 56 baby oh shit say no thank you for the 56 months son they seem kind of dark compared to the yellow on the mario kart craft yeah there's like a white missing at the top I noticed that too let's see what we can do here I think it's something like that on the crab not what I meant to do like the very top that's I think this is it don't get the animators guy yes he will need to be animated I think we can cut off half the texture here too there we go I think it's getting it's gonna could be around if you want to make it look like the same well these are gonna be very small crabs and they are already fairly high polling for such a small actor if anything we go the opposite direction and we do step honestly I'm not sure that one was worth it to remove let's keep this vertex at this point every single vertex is too valuable to remove we're gonna move its whole body to look around I saw a Twitter post today that said new study proves that the universe cannot be a simulation and I look at the science paper and it looked like absolute nonsense like reading the article I could tell like this is written by someone who has no fucking idea what they just read and then they wrote an article about it and made these grand claims about what is in the paper they've read it kind of feels like the articles that sometimes gaming journals write about my videos where they're just completely a hundred percent wrong so we are going to make these new crabs Mcdonald's I don't know Keaton did they do that that's funny if they did okay so this crab is globally loaded but the model is not rock-and-roll McDonald's rock-and-roll I love that song it's a good one they like all Japanese people just agreed on the fact that I am German genius I'll go to Japan and they'll be like oh my god I said said German genius no way it's really here or do you think they'd start by calling me names because I'm beefing with Nintendo kind of song request okay song request oh no McDonald's is a place to rock it is a restaurant where they buy food to eat it is a good place to listen to the music people flock here to get down to the rock music and lurk me in with a fake tour of the building oh that's a very bad lure I wouldn't want to come to a tour of a building why would I want to see a building we have buildings where I live McDonald's hamburgers are the worst. They are worse than Burger King. A Big Mac has 26 grams of fat. A Quarter Pounder has 28 grams of fat. Rock-and-roll McDonald's. Rock-and-roll McDonald's. Rock-and-roll McDonald's. Rock-and-roll McDonald's. Rock on London. Rock on Chicago. Wheaties. Purpose of champions. What the? Doop and parents. Uh-oh. What happened? It's kind of a banger. Okay, sorry guys for listening to this. It's a banger. Nevermind, it's no longer a banger. This part sucks. Sorry. Okay, back to Jet Set Radio. Jet Set Radio. Jet Set Radio. Jet Set Radio. Jet Set Radio. Jet Set Radio. Jet Set Radio. Last one, last one, last one... Pa Pa Pa pumt. Emergency litt service... ah! Emergency lit service... Ah, let's see... Light on now... Easy fix... Emergency lit service... What's this heck? Tech chest too big? Oh right, the eyes. I forgot about the eyes! How did we just forgot about the eyes? Emergency lit service... Emergency lit service... Emergency lit service... Emergency lit service... I'm pulling on this crap. 174 triangles. So this is a decent size. I think it's about as much as a Goomba. Chameleon machine. Chameleon machine. Chameleon. Chameleon. Chameleon. Light on now. Chameleon machine chameleon machine. Chameleon chameleon. This is such an uluma. Chameleon machine. Chameleon machine. Chameleon. Chameleon. Light on now. Chameleon machine. Chameleon machine. Chameleon. Uluma. This eye should be perfectly usable. What's wrong with this? Oh no. It's hung up again. My PC is gonna crash. Thank you Gimp. I must be addicted. There we go. It works. Light on now. Chameleon machine. Chameleon. Chameleon. Light on now. Chameleon machine. Chameleon machine. Chameleon. Chameleon. Light on now. Must be Magic Flavor. Flavor. Must be Magic Flavor. Chameleon. Chameleon. Chameleon. Light on now. We could make the legs more distinct. That is a very good point. Magic Flavor. Flavor. Magic Flavor. Flavor. Magic. I think something like that would help a lot. Well, the way I did it is kind of bad, but you get the idea. I think that already makes it a lot better. Light on now. Chameleon machine. Chameleon machine. Chameleon. So it's not going to be walking at first, and that's fine. Light on now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Magic Flavor. Now. Now. Magic Flavor. Now. Now. Magic Flavor. Now. Now. Magic Flavor. Now. Now. Now. Now. That makes sense, to me. Is this a song request, Zelda? Yes, alright. I was just going to say, you could probably get away with making these into polygons, and really make it look like a game theme or something. No, you would like a lot. Polygons don't contribute that much to the ROM space. Oh my god, they look awesome. They look so good! I'm so happy with these. Maybe just a little too big. I'm not sure why I did that. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. So, we could add a little bit of color to highlight places here on the crab. Without adding any extra cost. And that would be by taking this combiner and allowing Shade Alpha to influence it a little bit. Let's try it. Well, I suppose this adds a little bit of extra cost, but it's not much. I don't know. For example, if we wanted the tips of the legs to be brighter, we could be doing this. But the tips feels like the wrong place. I feel like if anything should be brighter, it's this part here. I don't know. So, to make it a bit of the class, add a little shadow or something so you can see it against the sand. I did forget to enable lighting on that. But... Maybe that is already solving the problem you have with this. And we're bringing 3D to the N64. Isn't that cool? Oh my god, I love this crab. We should make it so that you can jump onto the back of their shells to make them go inside, like curl up. Or like, go into defense mode. Good thing to enchant the bottom. Theoretically possible, but I would need to enable environment color for that. And that is extremely annoying to do, so I kinda don't want to. The reason it's annoying is because of the class 64 bug, or issue. It's not technically a bug, I think. Actually, it is a bug, nevermind. Is this class gonna animate? Yes, this class can animate. I gave them a bonus. We kinda need the animations now, though. We need to make it so when you jump on them, it kinda goes inside into defense mode with his claws down. Legs curled up, everything. And then he comes out after a bit. Maybe you can ground pound the small ones to destroy them, but I would say actually not. You can't kill them. There's going to be a gang of crabs. That's why we made this crab here, so we can just scale it up. The 2D one obviously wouldn't scale up very well at all. And they're going to get all the koi into a circle and bother them. And you ground pound all the crabs to save them. That was the idea. Yeah, I should bulge. Yeah, I should bulge. Wait, we don't have a bone on the ice. Not doable. The crabs are already really pushing it, armor-wise, so I don't want to add anything more to them. Oh, you jump on them? They're going to be big enough that you can do that. They're going to be big enough that you can do that. Anyway, let's fix the issue we had with the koi. What's the koi called? There it is. Am I going to punch the crabs? No. I'm just going to need a world count by now. We are in part 5 out of 15, but 5 is by far the biggest. 6 is pretty small. Honestly, after this one, they're all pretty small. Maybe except for 14. Actually, we only have 14, so we're at 5 out of 14. And 6 doesn't exist, so it's more like 5 out of 13. But one of them is just a tunnel, so that one we're going to finish in one day. Hmm. What does even work? Oh. That certainly was a bug. Okay. So... If we're going underground, we need to be right. We need to be right, so... It should do what we need, if they don't have a shadow. Okay. Let's see if the fish are better. Could you tell me how enemies are spawned in the world? When you load in the level, all the enemies get spawned at the same time. How much resources do far away colored enemies use? This is actually from another view. That depends on the enemy. Some enemies are more expensive to use. They simply are like, if you're not being drawn, don't execute the main loop. And then they cost very little. Maybe like 0.2 microseconds. Actually, probably more like 1 microsecond, I would say. And yes, they all get loaded at the same time. But 1 microsecond really isn't much, right? Okay. Let's have a look at your native res on a CRT. I mean, can you even film a CRT? How would I show this to you? Did we fix the bug? I think we might have. We're still at the breakdance kick, he does. We did this. Make them swim away when Mario gets close. That's also important. How many curves can the game handle? I would say around 40. But there's only like 4 here, so not to worry. Well, that's not a CRT. I don't think it's possible to film a CRT and have it look like it does in person. Right? Actually, that doesn't turn on the CRT filter. There's no way that looks like a CRT. I don't believe it for a second. I don't believe it. What does that mask do? Nothing. What does that mask do? Nothing. Guys, I need to discuss something. So I believe the moon landing happened. But. I have heard now multiple times that faking the moon landing would have been more expensive than doing the moon landing. And I don't believe that for a second. That we didn't have the lighting capabilities. Okay. Surely you could have made up the lighting capabilities for less than a couple billion dollars. Surely it's not that hard to get light to look somewhat parallel. Parallel enough for the fucking 480p grayscale television of 1968 to look real enough. Right? Territory is a territory. Territory is a territory. Territory is a territory. Territory is a territory. Couldn't you use a half-sphere or something with a light source in one place and then use the half-sphere to reflect the light back at a flat angle? That sounds very easy to do. Are you gonna break up with me or is it just a moon landing conspiracy? No, no, it's not a moon landing conspiracy. It's a anti-moon landing conspiracy conspiracy. You just mean to stand up to the extreme scrutiny of modern day analysis? I'm not sure what that means. No, no, I'm not saying they faked it. I'm saying it would have been possible and cheaper to fake it. At least the lighting would have been. Like, the lighting, that's all I care about. People are saying the lighting's impossible. I don't think it's impossible. Need to take a few minutes if there's a... Huh? Couldn't they just put some kind of huge filter film up over the set? I'm not sure what a filter is. The problem with having a big light is that the big light wouldn't be parallel. So that's not gonna work. Is this moon landing fake or confirmed? That's true, I was there to fake the tapes. Why are you talking about going to the moon today? I'm talking about the light. The Russians would have to declare anything getting exposed to the Earth to the world? Yes, probably. You just use the sun as the light and then put some kind of translucent film up to change the light to the... Wait, that's a very good point. We have a parallel light. The fucking sun. Wait, what if you just reflected the sun at the right angle to get the parallel light in the studio too? Wait, that's so easy. That's even easier than what I said you could do. So why are people saying it's impossible to fake the lighting? That's obviously false. Like flowing dust with no turbulence because of the lack of atmosphere? Lightning. Okay, but I keep hearing the lighting is the issue. That's all I care about right now. I'm saying the lighting would not have been an issue. Lightning. Lighting is easy? Yep. Yes! Yes. Yeah, if they faked it, I probably would have known it by now. But they could have. I think. Like, theoretically, it is thinkable. With the technology of the 60s. To get parallel light. Alright, Papa. Have fun with your beer. Okay, there's one problem here. And that is, you get close to the fish, and then maybe Mario is still nearby. But let's just see how this looks. Was in 2001 released in 1968? I have no idea. What is 2001? Is that the one where the AI goes evil and kills the people on board of the spaceship? Regular language is this. C. This is not working at all. They don't care at all that I'm bothering them. Aww. Let's see if this is doing anything at all. Oh, wait. This has to be max. Whatever do it. I don't know why it makes a minute max. They deleted the AI decoding accidentally. Dang. That is kinda sus. But honestly, knowing what I know about game code preservation. Like, I know a lot of companies delete their N64 codes. Maybe it's not that sus. Bro, why are you so slow, brother? I put your velocity to minimum 50. Why would you be going so slow? That doesn't look like a 50 to me. Is something else influencing this? Wait. We're not even reading the coi velocity. Oh my god. Oh my god. The whole time we have not been reading the coi velocity. No wonder the fish look like that. We probably made them way too fast now. Oh my god. Mario has to turn faster when Mario is nearby. Is he dead? No, he's not. Alright. Now we have to coaster me away from Mario when he has not saved him yet. Oh. They don't look like they're reacting to Mario at all. They are. That fish is chilling. I go up to him. And he's like, nope. Leave me alone. And I go up to him again. And he's like, nope. And when I go up, he's like, nope. I wanna hang out with you. Hang out with me. Or this guy here. He's like, nope. Maybe they're not turning fast enough still. Yeah, I think they need to turn even faster. You will have to live on the fetish house we're keeping. I'm afraid. Fire. Maybe 400 is too little. One more test to see if it feels good. And I think then we have this option at the end. Do they still get stuck? I think not. I believe I fixed that. But I'm not 100% certain. That guy looks like he may be stuck. Nope, he wasn't stuck. I think it's good that you can't touch them. Because otherwise people might think they have to touch them or something. I don't like how the bubbles just disappear here. That looks really bad. Do you see that? Yeah. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. Do you see that? I'm gonna make a note for that. My swimming bubbles shouldn't just disappear. Get them up. Pop the enemy from... Well, what was that? Yes, much more. Oh, Zayna's making a completely new HUD, Ireland. It looks pretty decent so far. No, they don't care about Mario until Mario saves them. Why would they? They're fish. Which I can assume. Yep, that's fish for you. They are zooming a little too much though, I agree. Maybe half their base velocity. A little lower. So they look more calm. I think their guidance was 8 pixels, but I'm not sure. They have a lot of guidance, so I wouldn't be surprised if there was one. Therefore, whether something ought to be touched or not, whether or not you can, it's not working. If you can't touch it, you ought to touch it. You can touch everything. It's just that when it looks like you barely can touch something, then it looks like you ought to touch it. And you'll never know whether you have. Well, they're not scared, but they don't enjoy your presence either. Okay, so we got the crab. I think I want the crab animations before I finish the crab mission here. So we will be shipping this off to Zayna, who will be doing the crab animations. We also need to give the crab some shadow here, actually. They have a shadow. It's just way too small. Send it over? I will. Okay. Still way too small. Oh my god. Oh, hell nah. That looks roughly appropriate. Maybe a little lower opacity. But yes, let me ship this to Zayna. And the animations we need. We need walk. Idle. Let me write this down. Okay. 1, walk. 2, idle. In idle, look around. 4, um, threatening dance. 5, maybe like a type of car? Oh yeah, and 6, defensive curl and unfurl of the sun forms. 6 animations for these guys. Yes, they are scaled with the scale of the actor. But the culling radius is not. It's honestly just making my life easier. Or not making my life easier, it makes my life harder, but it makes the performance better. Yo, that fish came all the way over here. That's kind of cool that they can do that. Catch. Pet, pet. That's what my baby always says. Pet, pet. Come on, pet, pet. She always wants to pet our lawnmower. Shh. Little threatening idle. That's what we have. The threatening dance. Anyway, I'm done for today. Good progress. I'm extremely happy with the crab. So, until next stream. Bye bye!
