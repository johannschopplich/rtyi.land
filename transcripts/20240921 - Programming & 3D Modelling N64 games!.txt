You you you you you Hello, is it working now? I was muted. Oops Yes, Mick was muted I hope it's unmuted now Oh Now it works, all right, what did you think of the normal maps? You guys like my styrofoam They said they didn't like the color In the comments a lot so I can still change the color I was thinking though, this would be like colored styrofoam to look like mountains But I can make it pure white if people think that's better Hello Skyloft This is gonna be the crayon star that you have to draw I Don't know my mom's work. You're probably right. I just kind of made a bullshit math. How do you think they should work? What do I need to change? Because I've heard people say that it should only depend on the light direction, but if it only depended on the light direction Then it would be Aesthetic texture and it wouldn't look good at all. I think it should depend on the reflection to the light And right now it's reflecting as though the camera was the light source But it should get the angle between the light source, which is up there and the camera I think So that's probably what we want Meaning I need to add a little bit of rotation to everything Correct You Where is the grass here the grass should be fine because the angle is from above anyway That's it, what's it Oh No, I said you get more lighting detail without more writers because something facing away from the Sun should be less lit So did I make a height map what did I make I Mean it would be relatively easy to just multiply with the lighting direction here instead of the camera direction But then it will just be a static texture at that point. I will look pretty Boring So, what did I make did I make a height map the whole point of this is to be able to like tell the height Dynamically right with this. It kind of looks a lot more 3d than it. Otherwise would that's the point Texture should be more dense. I Don't think that would look good we can try it though Actually trying it might be a lot of work, maybe I don't want to try it So you're telling me I did a height map instead of a normal map is that what I did here Can do that based on camera angle unless use parallax occlusion mapping, but I think that's possible in the n64 I Looks nice, but it's incorrect And by the way just to the lighting details it's gonna look very non-dynamic The whole point of this is to be able to have the lighting bounce of it dynamically so it fits what the camera would see This is not what a normal map would look like on a reflective material And and bevels because you'd have to go get another angle, yep, that's correct Bump textures. This is a bump map Is that what this is Is that the scientific name, oh my god, my whole keyboard is gonna fall apart You I mean it looks pretty close to what I have, right? It's a normal map what the hell an approximation of a normal map On a frame it's actually the lighting will change but it's a purely diffuse. Yeah. Okay. Maybe that's the idea then Might want to dole out the sides of the film if you can yeah, you can't That's part of the problem Unless I added eight more angles to it. I mean we can take a look what that would look like real quick You Something like that is what you want. Oh, that's more than eight angles. Actually, it's like 12 angles Just make a less lay elevation it will look perfect Like that does it need to be whiter You Like so Maybe add some decals for some holes Well, the whole point of this is so that I don't need to add the girls shoe in game fine You And the chamfer what is the chamfer It's too much like stone I Wanted to look like a mountain made out of styrofoam. So looking a little bit like stone is good. I think Oh And maybe without the primitive color this would look fine gonna remove the primitive color again Yeah, it's gonna look different in game than here in blender because the texture is different The ambient is too light Oh, but it has to look whitish It's to be smooth I see that near the edges that's not possible unfortunately Jump is cutting the content to add one more face. Yeah. Well doing that only horizontally could work. Yes Yes melt stone Yeah Yeah, Daryl had this idea a while back and this is just me using that trick So we could absolutely like Do something like this? Yes And it would make this look a lot rounder. But oh my god, that's gonna be so much work to do I It's also 600 triangles, holy shit Hello my a mic It looks like moon rock. Well, it also kind of looks like styrofoam Either way and they've been quite a few changes to the level since I last streamed Let me just give you the rundown real quick It's too much either way DB Cooper I'm mr. Same as a height map and neither of them are useful unless you add pom or do tessellation and almost like What's useless unless you have a dynamic lights? Also, you have a specular Well, what do I have? Can you tell me what I have then like cuz you said I have nothing You Right, okay. So one of the changes I've made first of all, oh god, that's not what it's supposed to be First of all, I added crayons the beginning they are like blocks of wood We got there's gonna be a tilting bridge here to get over to the Luigi area and Then When you're gonna have to do here once you're over here you can Talk to a Luigi doodle here And the Luigi doodle is gonna be like I need a yellow crayon to finish my star and then you have to go over here We're gonna put a bunch of enemies here so that this is actually like a challenge a little bit And there's gonna be a yellow crayon here that you can pick up and carry and then it's like escort the item go back here And you bring in the noodle and then you draw the star And There's gonna be another area here So I'm trying to change this a little bit There's a little bit of a rock here no, well, this is this is the sandy area This is supposed to be like a sandy dune. This rubber band will shoot you up here Maybe I'll replace the rubber with a paper spring instead We got some pyramids. So we got the tent. We got these cactuses. I Have a palm with some fake lighting. What do you think of my palm? Do you like my palm? It's a little bit reflective because it's made out of felt it's reflecting from up there And then We got a noises here with some cut out grass Another piece of sand and you're gonna have to go up here and there's gonna be googly-eyed swamps here And you're gonna have to jump on the googly-eyed swamps to get up here For me you can go up here and there's gonna be a paper spring here And then you can go inside the pyramid and inside the pyramid. There's gonna be the red coin section So the red coin section was removed from where it was before so that basically finishes like two halves of two stars And What else are we gonna have? There's gonna be a paper plane here with a Yoshi doodle telling you to get this five silver stars or something like that and The paper plane is gonna be on a rubber band and the paper is gonna go And you're gonna go this way and the paper plane is gonna come by here from where you will see the 8-bit pipe over there if you pay a little bit of attention and The paper is gonna just go crazy and crazy and crazy and shoom shoom shoom until you land back here You're just gonna hit the wall here So, that's the third star Nope it's not blending two textures. You're just making it up It's actually just a normal map that I'm multiplying the normal vectors with the camera vector And then the paper has to look has to look more important like large and work on central right now It looks a bit unimportant, but paper To Luigi paper here. No I think the outer sky should look like the ceiling of a building instead of just pitch black if you looked at the outer sky This is what the skybox is Oh, yeah, that's definitely gonna be pretty crayon painting everywhere And then there's two more stars we have to do Wait, one, two, three, right. One star is gonna be inside here. It's gonna be a cave area with the hidden entrance That's four one, two, three, four and Then the fifth one the 8-bit pipe and then the last one we need is just an icy section here with the toad at The end there's gonna be pure platforming By the way blocks made out of regular rocks or rays or something styrofoam Yeah, this course was really fast to do because it's made out of simple craft materials So really all I need to do is really just to shade us and stuff At least that's how I feel about it Please address the mushrooms or death will come what's wrong with the mushrooms. I like how rough they look Um any OST wishes today You You just look low-res Well, the only way to make them look IRS is to remove the material shine Paper umbrellas for mushrooms Yeah, that could look pretty good I'd be up for this. Yeah So like one of those with just like white dots on it like this with white dots Morgan we OST and let's do it Dude, I wanted to play maraca. We were Zeina and I found out you can't actually play Grand Prix's with two people. That's crazy So, how would a paper umbrella look like here It's Lilaa Oh Oh Those plates that also looks very cool. I Like this a lot, what do you think by a bank this sort of umbrella? How do I get the texture right though I Think that's one demo going. Oh, well, I would presume I haven't heard of any blockers I Should have already perfect The problem with the umbrella that I don't know if it's the frills on the umbrella I have no idea how to do those On the plate I can just kind of draw them in I think with a bunch of decals on top for the dots here I just looks easy enough to do Easy ball in 10 seconds true You When I'm at your suggestions popsicle sticks pipe cleaners the silly straws silly straws, what's that? Oh That's them the party blowers. Oh No, it's this And popsicle sticks were in consideration pipe cleaners are also planned the problem with more of these is that they are very Expensive to render realistically Same with sunny straws. I Wonder if they have a paper plate on model resource Now it's plates from paper Mario I Wonder if they have the texture anywhere like this texture order would be perfect There are craft constructions like this that are recognized by IRL because of context and lighting and shit, but in LoL you probably need them to be more common items, ideally not multiple things together. Agreed. That's also why I'm putting so much effort on making sure I have lighting effects and stuff, cause that makes them a lot more recognizable. Hello Leyra! Could you spare a few minutes as climbable elements that's a 2D sprite like how the vines are in the first level of star road? Yes. You are correct. Okay. Maybe they have something on tech check-in. Oh, some of these work well. The way the frills are done on this, I kind of like it, but that makes me think I probably have a metal texture that looks fine. Without the gloss, that would be perfect. What is going on? We are meeking in 64 games. I believe you can probably do 16 planes with the bristle textures around the stick. Yeah, but that's expensive to render. That was also my first thought on how to do it though, so yeah, that might be what we have to do. Something kind of like this would be perfect, or this, but without the light. How come almost every stream I do just devolves into looking for textures? Is this just how I'm built? Do I just look for textures all the time? Am I doomed to roam this earth just looking for textures all my life? Oh, this would be a nice texture, I think. I think I can make this work. What's 90 divided by 4 and then multiplied by 3? Oh wow, I'm stupid, that's not what I want. Is it 60 degrees? Okay, just don't listen to me then. I think this could just be a billboard in texture, oh that would look awful. I don't know. I don't know. Something like this is what I'm thinking. And then I just need to edit the texture a little bit. I will ignore that, do not worry. What's the minimum piece I need of this texture? I think I can cut it like here and here. Is this going to be seamless? Looks pretty seamless to me. Alright, I guess I'll use this texture then. Wait, no, I can multi-texture this. That's cheaper than decals. I just do 32 by 64 here. I actually also think that this might be too dark in parts, maybe? Not sure. Hello Kyle, any tips to get started? I just started on page 1 of the Blender documentation and then I just read until I learned how to do it. I do not like the donut tutorial. I'm the number 1 donut tutorial hater. Do you guys think I should make a video about advanced lighting effects? I feel like I don't know all the lighting effects yet, but I also feel like people would like a video like that. I'm learning a few buttons and watching K-Spot for like a week. This will work, yeah. Certainly one way to do it. Yeah, the donut tutorial is useless unless you want to make a donut and don't know anything about blender. I don't like that this is such a dark color. We did this and now we put decals on top. Oh, that's actually super nice. The problem with f3dx free stuff is that emulators haven't gotten there yet. So if I do f3dx free stuff, our stuff is not going to run on emulator. Emulators are holding us back like that. Should we be waiting for the red spot since it's paper?  How do we do this? How do we make it look like it's painted? Hello coyote. Maybe cloth wrinkle texture. Wait, that's a nice idea. What if I take this and I just cut out some white parts? I don't know why it spawns emulator spots that aren't painted. No, you can get red dinner plates like this. Yeah, it's not round enough. That's round enough for me. Let me try this. I don't know. What do you think? How long do you spend to set up the camera to make the thumbnail? Five seconds. Why aren't you including the edges? Less triangles. It's a bit nicer this way. I like this a lot. Easy strategy to clamp the spot texture and give him every face individually. That's true. But I think it looks good this way. Yes, your complaining was worth it. I am glad you were crying so much in my chat. I'm glad you're such a little baby. Dude, these mushrooms are sexy. What are the L mushroom layer? That's gone. Hello, summary. I'm glad you're liking it. Oh my God, I love it. So cool. Our actual objective today, though, was to start working on the ice section. Are we all fine on the styrofoam now? Any more complaints about the styrofoam before I move on? What happened to my styrofoam? Oh, I stopped rendering my styrofoam. Whoops. Sony wagon cubes. I need to support every orientation of the texture manually. Meaning if you want something that's not a cube, I need to add the new rotation to it. More volcano section. There might still be a volcano section. I'm actually not sure right now. I'll grab my styrofoam back. Hey, more styrofoam complaints right now. Otherwise, we will be moving on. The N64 does not have normal map support. I added the support. The texture is computed on the CPU. And then the GPU just has surrendered. But that means I need to generate one texture for each orientation. Too styro, not foamy enough. Styrofoam is bad for the environment. Well, it's a good thing this guy isn't locked up in his house. Any complaints about the normals being smoothed? Well, they're not smoothed. I think that's part of the issue here. Unfortunately, it is not possible to smooth the normals with this technique. They are very flat. That's kind of the issue in my opinion. Switch to cardboard. Most of the normals are cardboard. God, look how sexy these plates look. You see that shit? Oh my god. That looks perfect. Looks a bit flat from some angles. Yeah, it looks extremely flat. It's a bit unfortunate I have to cut it into blocks like this. I wish I could also cut out triangles. To make it look like an actual mountain. Instead of like this. Right now, when I want to make something look rounder, I have to do the Minecraft sphere thing. Is the orientation wrong? I don't think so. The orientation looks right to me. Sometimes it's almost pure white. Yeah, like this. I mean, it's easy to make it not be pure white anymore. But... I don't know, I'm getting a lot of mixed responses with this. The edges look too sharp for styrofoam. Yeah, unfortunately I can't soften the edges. There's a dark line. Yeah, like on stuff like that, there will be a line. There's nothing I can do about that. Maybe another bevel is necessary. Which would make the texture count go from 4 to 8. What if the shrooms start falling apart from my jumps on them, so that you can just stand on them and relax? Nah. But I like it like this. Man, I'm getting a lot of mixed responses with this.  And... It is pretty crafty. It looks like the lava is lit from two light sources. This is actually true. Because this is lit from two light sources. And I need to fix that still. Wait, someone donated? What's this? I'll take 5... Yo! Thank you for the $50! Holy shit! Thank you, Yuan. Very appreciated. Also, I'm glad it's finally showing up on stream. Could be low-resolution maybe? No, can't do that. Can buy one burger? I can buy more than one burger. $50 is like 10 burgers at least. Alright, let's move on to the next part. Which will be... After I disable the back face culling on here, here we go. He says we're going with fries but I don't like fries. Actually I do like fries but I don't want to eat fries. Everyone likes fries, let's be real. Yo, are we getting coconut mauled right now? Are we coconut mauling the whole stream? Okay, so we want an ice section starting here and I kind of want there to be like an interesting way to get up there. I want to do something where you go through a box and then up another. When you tip Patreon. If you want to tip you can do that with the link in the description. There's a streamlabs link I think to a tip page of mine. Or you can tip me on Patreon if you want as well but that's like a monthly thing. Aerograts would literally be so awesome if it's possible. You don't like the grass I have right now Lila? Did you see the grass I have right now? Rumia, that's actually so true. Also, all the restaurants pet their food with fries. I was at a restaurant last week and I ordered a chicken wrap. And maybe 70% of the plate, realistically 70% of the calories on my plate were just fucking fries I didn't even order. This is also like normal map holographic grass. It's multi-textured with itself so it looks a little different. Small straight pieces of cardboard would make more sense as popsicle sticks. The small straight pie- oh you mean that? The one that's not even on a bridge? That absolutely could be a popsicle stick. Maybe we were gonna make this a popsicle stick just so we can say there's a popsicle stick in here and no one would be like, huh, you guys didn't even add a popsicle stick.           You can add popsicle sticks to this. Yeah, let's make this a popsicle stick. But this, I want this to be a tilting bridge. Alright, let's make a popsicle stick. What do they look like? Oh, like that. Okay, cool. That's really easy to make. It's really easy. I have NFX for paper grass along with grass texture that looks like paper grass from afar. I'm not sure what paper grass means to you. Is it like green colored paper on the floor? Is it like cut out grass that's like made out of paper? Do you want me to put individual bushels of grass here? Okay. That look. Oh, what the hell? That would look crazy, but I have no idea how we're supposed to do this. Exactly done. That's what I'm thinking as well. You're just putting the fries in there to pat your food so you don't get any of the expensive stuff. Basically, I myself, I don't go to restaurants unless it's all you can eat and then I eat all the expensive stuff. I'm not paying money to go eat fucking fries. Does it look like graphics for grass that Mario Odyssey uses? Oh, I remember that. Okay, Leela, so you're thinking NFX of just little bushels of paper like that? I'm not sure. Yeah, I know. They're very light-touch. That's what I'm seeing in Google Images here as well. That was my thought as well. Oh my God, that's just first try perfect. What the hell? What the hell? This looks perfect. I mean, girl, these textures myself. No, they are ripped from all kinds of video games. Okay, now the question, how do we make this interesting? Oh, we also still need to use the ruler that you jump off of. I never get steaks, period, because I don't like steak. I'm that kind of person. Photorealistic popsicle stick with a 32x32 texture. Like chicken? True. I will eat all the chicken. And all beans suck. I think we need to introduce some enemies here. I think we should have an enemy that's just like a scissor going around and just like attacks you. And this feels like a prime spot for it. And we need a few of those. And we need a few of those. This is the safest environment you could encounter it with. I think the scissor should be unbeatable. Why not the Dire Dire Dogs throw guys? I don't know if throw guys are Dire Dire Dogs. Do you mean Heathos from Wet Dried World? Or Chuckyos? Because no, we want something that fits the aesthetic of the level. Make a paperclip remover enemy on a previous stream. Looks like a big pair of jaws, but I think you missed it. Paperclip remover. Ah. I'm worried this goes a little bit into Paper Mario the Origami King. If could easily be remodeled as cardboard. True, especially with rubber bands. But what are the enemies we have written down? Scissors. We have a Squirmle. This. Still don't know what we would do with this. Maybe we can just cut paper from under the player. Yeah, that's too difficult to do. Cardboard Wump. Cardboard Chain Chomp was an idea. Thwomps and Bombs for sure. Right, and I was thinking Cardboard Wump. I think this is an enemy, but I'm no longer thinking that. I think the Squirmle and this one just has to go. We need to make different enemies. Is this Crafting World? No. We should think about more obstacles and enemies and stuff. Which platforming elements have we not used yet? Confetti. Right, if we do the snow area, we definitely have to have a Confetti Blizzard. We barely used any buttons. We haven't really used any enemies. We have this plant here. Yeah, exactly, Risky. That's why I kind of removed it from the list just now. Fuzzy Wire. Oh, that's the Pipe Cleaner. What other enemies can we craft? The Thwomp, Bomb and Wump are very easy to do. Let's look at the Mario 64 enemies and see if we have any inspiration. Imp? No. Big Boo? No. Goomba? Bob-omb? Bomb? Yes. Boo? No. Bookend? Eh. Bullet Bill would be easy to craft. Leela, are you random generating the chat messages again? Yeah, but I don't want a static texture, not a random. I want that the reflective property of the Styrofoam is conveyed. So maybe what I made is not a normal map. Maybe it's something else. But the point of it is to show the reflectiveness. Should we have cardboard... Bullet Bills? I'm not sure. I'm not sure yet. Chair? No. No. No. Fly Guy? Foosh? A Whiteboard Eraser? Oh, yes. Yes. That would be funny. Grindle? Definitely inside the Pyramids. I'm gonna note that down. Diffuse? I don't know what a diffuse material is. Yeah, I will definitely put googly eyes on any enemies here. Or buttons. Those window plants. Is my favorite cheese? I don't like cheese. No questions and no refusals. Oh no. What the hell? What is this? What am I looking at? Cotton balls? We have cotton balls up here. Wait, I didn't show that. You guys need to tell me whether you like them. The first one looks like a shrimp. Was it a spinning shrimp? What do you think of my cotton balls here? I tried to do the shell texturing or whatever you guys called it. I do not like cheese. What do we have? Lava bubble is not an enemy in Mario 64. Skeeter, Koopa Troopa's defense, spindle, spin rift, spiny. What is a spindle? It's a type of grindle. Yeah, I don't think there's any more enemies we can realistically turn into cardboard very well in Mario 64. Except maybe the eeveel. Shit. And I don't think the eeveel would be very fun anyway. Fly Agarix? What is that? Oh. A mushroom. Not for the damaging Mario. That's not visually communicated very well. Just give me Fire Goomba. But do we want Goombas as enemies here? Paint-based enemy. Can't want Thwomps, Arplands and Womps as well. I have some noted down already. Oh, I thought the grindle was the spindle. Oh, then I'm gonna write down cardboard spindle. Makes sense that the spindle is the spinning one. I just feel like we need more mechanics here. I'm not sold on it yet. Because right now I feel like I can't make any more interesting sections. Like I still have the ruler available to me. I have the idea of the rolling crayon too. I guess that could be interesting. But I want something with this here. Yeah, you should spend more time thinking about what to create than you spend creating. Oh, not like what for rolling rocks. I was thinking like the locks on Mario 64 that you can stand on. A bullet bill cannon. Yeah, that would work. But I was thinking actually this is maybe where the rolling lock section is. So you just have to stand on the lock and roll it over to the other side. So this would be a hollow cardboard section. Cardboard thing. With like holes in it for the thing. I need to look up some concept art. You need to make my balls. I do what I want. What do you mean I need to look up some concept art? Google, I spy books. Okay. I spy books. Oh, is this like something people build? There's some interesting stuff in here. Yeah, more hazards is definitely what I want and more like fun platforming stuff. And there's a lot of stuff here, but I don't see anything interesting enough for me to investigate that. I think I'm actually going to change how the section works a little bit. I'm going to make this two cardboard plates that are like stuck next to each other. I'm going to make this two cardboard plates that are like stuck next to each other. Definitely add saw blades. Oh, yes, you could definitely make a saw blade out of cardboard. I do like that idea. Yep. That's a very nice idea. Cardboard saw blades. I'm going to make this two cardboard plates that are like stuck next to each other.  Wait, there's a wooden Galaxy 2 level. Puzzle playing Galaxy. Let's see what we got. Hello, 8-bit slasher. I'm going to have paper springs, kind of like that. This level is like the most golden music in all of Mario Galaxy. This song is like perfection for a 3D platformer. This is actually what peak OST sounds like. This is actually what peak OST sounds like. This song sounds like jumping, you know what I mean? And like fun. And I like the falling bridges and stuff I Could do something like that Should we have falling cardboard bridges? Maybe with like a string attached so that they can roll back up That would be pretty easy to do I'll add that idea to the list Falling Cardboard which would be spring roll back up I Don't suffer levels Chuck's balls Ball of yarn a ball of yarn is really difficult to make like look decent on n64 Scissors are already a planned enemy, but I think actually saw blades fit better just visually speaking You So what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna make this be like one long section There's gonna be a hole in here and then you can walk on the rolling Lock cardboard stick until the end and then somewhere we're gonna have saw blades as well I'm not sure when a saw blades come in yet, but I really like the idea. So we're gonna do it somewhere Hello up to secure it Oh Oi oi oi That's what they say in those Instagram cringe reels about enemy guys, they also always cool You So we're doing this and I think this will look really nice I Think that the Raven was was the last boss made before the final boss a fight I'm not a hundred percent. Sure. It won't stay the last boss because we still have an overworld to me and We're gonna lose side levels as well And I'm not a hundred percent sure that there won't be a final boss or a boss in the the other level And always happen, you know Of a world boss, you know, but there could be like a fight or something for a star like I I don't think that will be but I'm not a hundred percent excluding it. I Think it'd be foolish to say that the definitely won't be I Don't play man It's not just you I'm definitely the main guy working on it But Biobak is helping me rework some of my levels and but it was making most of the music No way desert music he wouldn't I Made a Yoshi do not wait. Oh So not much if you can use it but do with it what you will for the Yoshi to the thing It's up to your standards. I See I see Okay, actually the problem with this is that it's too high quality I was thinking the doodle characters in this we're gonna look like really shittily drawn doodles. You know what I mean? Like this this is what I was thinking Also, if you do that do not split up the texture and let me split up the picture Because there's a lot of stuff that goes wrong when you split it up time to draw a crayon. Let's go And any different similar set of musician and designer with you, oh, that's cool Well, it's not supposed to be a kid still it's just like an amateur doodle Like if I was doodling a Yoshi it would look similar to that We do want this to be a craft a level but we don't want this to be expertly crafted Why would you do like that How do you want me to do what are the rules for doodling But the law down on me am I arrested from being bad at doodling I Don't know why probably some form of pride but I've been watching at least two of your words almost every day for the last few years So when I Chris loves God Zaina still does not know what that is. Fortunately for her I Have never been at someone who was gonna to the art Zelda Even as a kid in school. I refused to draw like that. I Just didn't like doing it then. I thought it was a waste of my time I Remember on the last day of elementary school My teacher was like look how far you've come when you were first in this class You said you hated drawing and now you like it And I want right now you're doing it and I said I still hate it. I'm just doing it. So you leave me alone That was funny You Sewing machine. We don't want the machinery that this was made with in there We just want it to look like it was made with that machinery. That makes sense And you I'm a 3d model I was I just don't do 2d drawing It just looks fucking sick actually Hello Zaina, I'm doing the overall just yes, the overall is the most important part It will tie everything together and the later we do it the more information we have about the rest of the game A crayon is not square Some of these crayons are all of the crayons are five vertices to save on vertices only Look how cool this looks. Oh, that's a perfect nice freezable sickle stick Okay, that's how my transformers bridges I have a ruler there it's not semi-transparent but it's gonna work as a trampoline Yeah, so here you'll have to jump on the crayon and then roll it down that's gonna be such a difficult section I really need to make the jump onto it as easy as possible Oh Yes, it will be your she's fruit islands and we have a few plans for how it works We serve ice cream sticks and have a dip nope That's Exactly what this is for Danik we're gonna have a crayon in here and it will roll down Hello better, no, this is very normal trust And the crayon could use some work what's wrong with it I Have a piece of glue here that gets you stuck if you walk on it Hello of Yoshi story, yeah, I can kind of see it Check the DMS, let's see what we got I Can have this guy in the level talking to you just like on the 2d cutout He's pretty nice I like him Let's see what I can do with this Actually, you need to fix it of just white border here Actually, this should be fine You can do this and then cut them out What else I need? I want I need a toad one as well and a Luigi one But let me first check how this works out Roger Make it paper and make it bounce I have an idea of what you're saying God, why is my blender so slow? I hope this won't turn out too high poly It's only 35 triangles, so this should be fine so far What the fuck? Dude, I hate this new blender version I was thinking something like this for Yoshi Triangulate doesn't make a difference You left some white between the fingers That's fine Oh my god, dude, what is wrong with this blender version? Who thought that was a good idea? Shoot him So minimum piece of paper Shoot them Isn't that what I said? Shoot them Shoot the creature that made this I'm glad you think so Yes, keep boy was true No, this is not a performance issue The question is how do we animate this guy? That's the one thing I'm worried about What the fuck? So one idea I had is Something like this Burst fastener on This one and have him wave back and forth It's not that easy Unfortunately Because we only have vertex weights One or zero So I need to subdivide this per bone somehow I don't know what a breast fastener is I'll be real with you And then we can animate him To do stuff like this Oh that's nice actually DMs you send it Oh I don't understand how this works with this object Can you run while using a mushroom? Don't stick it in the same menu that Mario's eyes see Instead of fade to black it fade to red Is it fading to black? It's not supposed to Oh yeah there you go That was a bug You roll on paper and then split the two birds out And paper could spin on them basically Oh I don't think we even need that Like this could be a stalking animation you know what I mean? Let's cardboard, cardboard bends too I have not coin but I need this one for fast 64 You shouldn't bend cardboard I don't have access to cardboard right now Put him on a stick and have him bounce and spin around I have him bounce and spin around but he will be cardboard Like the things in a victory museum But this is fun this is like someone bending the cardboard Why does this foot do that? That's just how he's weighted I think Yeah I can maybe Make that a bit better like this That's a bit better I like this a lot I think I prefer this over the putting him on sticks You can do other stuff too like You know move his body How it's sent That's nice too You know what's really funny? When people refer to the boyfriend or girlfriend as their current boyfriend or girlfriend It's something about that just It just hits different you know As if I'm planning to get a new one exactly I'm not saying it's unrealistic but I'm saying if you're implying you're already planning to swap your partner out It's kind of fucking funny if you talk like that Where is rainbow right? Am I blind? Hello? Oh I mean this is just alphabetical Why is that so difficult? Look Leela I'm not the one changing the order every other week alright? Stop hating You're just a hater You're just jealous Well it's not about what sounds decent it's about what hits hard You know keep your partner on your toes Just know they're on thin ice by calling them your current partner This is quiz 14 and after this I only have one left and quiz 15 is only halfway done Yeah I didn't change okay but the order is different everywhere Leela It's like this order right where it's alphabetical and then It's also alphabetical here but it's not alphabetical everywhere I can't even set the destination level right now Oh it's here Why do you do that? What do you mean why do you do that? What do I need to select? I need to select something? What are you talking about? Yes I know I don't need to select it here I still do it What do you see streaming during my work break? How's the programming for demodeling and c4 games going? Good? Are you a bot? Is there a reason? The reason that I selected is habit It's so deep in my muscle memory I need to actively think about not doing it to not do it Maybe one day the habit will disappear but that day is not right now Is that so? What the hell? Blender Knife 2 was doing so well and then that happened. Only 24. Pussy in Bio? No I won't take a dabbing picture. Pussy in what? That must have been a while time from Bio back when that was a thing. Actually that's probably still a thing isn't it? I haven't seen any Pussy in Bio on Twitter in so long. HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEante New Blender. Remember when PewDiePie made like a really racist song? And then people were saying it's not even that racist. When did he do that? Like 2017? The only thing I remember is the bridge. The fact he recovered from the bridge, honestly, that's like the comeback of the century. That's crazy that he can recover from the bridge. It's Cardboard Toads. Did I have a bridge incident already? No, I did not. And so like I was saying already, as if to imply it was definitely going to happen at some point. Thank you for having so much trust in me. I have not messaged any minors yet and I don't plan to do so. He messaged me about Cortana and shit. I have talked to Lilaa and Lilaa is a minor, but I have only talked to her about Quaternions. Surely I cannot be cancelled for this. Lilaa is no longer a minor. I can now send her all the rancid messages. I am kidding. I'm kidding. I shouldn't even say this as a joke. People are going to be like, bro, pre-ordered. Messages queued up for the birthday. I'm going to do it like that. Never beating the cancelled allegations. Remember when I forced you to work for me for a year? I never forced anyone to work for me. And DM'd you about Styrofoam and you're a coal miner? Exactly. That's Jova. Hello Spaghetto. That is a funny message Lila. I'm such a funny guy. Good job finding something funny I say. I just wanted to do that real quick. Quaternions also looks off, but they could animate it like that. How do I best spend though? No. I like what I have here. I'm a fan of it. You can toggle expert script loads. Oh, cool. Don't be like Mr. Beast. I will be Mr. Beast. I will have 100 million subscribers. Tag you and stun you in 2D? No, the game is 3D. They will attack you in all three dimensions. Will Mr. Beast even do? Well, I mean, obviously he has kind of a scummy business taking advantage of children. But like, and the videos are obviously fake, but like, we already knew that. So I don't think he did anything new that's bad. A bunch of like, work law violations with the Amazon show. But like, we knew that. Honestly, nothing new came out. Just people turned on their brain. The Geneva Conventions thing is the most overblown thing ever. I'll tell you the story from what I understand here. So Geneva Conventions, sleep torture, not allowed. You're not allowed to torture someone by keeping them awake forever. So what happened? This one guy, he was in a room and the room had lights on. And that was the Geneva Convention violation that the lights were on at night. Surely you could have had like, used a shirt and like, made the blind around your eyes so you could sleep. No one was stopping you from doing that. Bro kept the fucking light on. That's not a Geneva Convention violations. Zeina has done that to me before. I agree. Which is why you can bind your eyes with a t-shirt or you can like, put it in the blanket or something. It doesn't fix it. Well, it significantly helps to a point where it's not an issue anymore. In your thick blanket. Just bind it around your eyes three times. What if the room was warm? Well, he didn't complain about that. Can you do a sleep stream with lights on to protect your mind? I wear a sleep mask to bed, so I can't even see whether the lights are on or off. Um, either way, so after this lock section, there needs to be something else here. Of course, it's a fair enough complaint, but it's not the same as being a war criminal. The Geneva Convention is laws that are supposed to govern what countries can do to each other. During war times, so that no one is being treated unnecessarily cruelly. Yeah, exactly. Smart, she was. I think it was paid something like $100,000 for 10 days. You know, it's kind of a good salary. See a spaghetto? True, never around. Also true. I didn't consent to it. So. Wait. Are you guys seeing branding? I just got a message. Upgrade your plan to remove branding. Is there a fucking restream logo in my stream? There better not be. No, there isn't. Okay, well, it's showing me that there is a logo. Which is crazy. You are the logo. All right, I'll believe you guys. Okay, let's look at snow, cardboard, diorama. We want to take some of these elements and put that in the next section. I don't know what the next section will play like. I just know this will be a platforming section to get to the Toad Doodle. That's true, sheep hair. But there also haven't been many big wars. Actually, there have been big wars recently, though, right? Nope, I hate Mario Sunshine. Although I think that's because of the game, not because of Mario. But in case it doesn't hate, you know, what game is really good? What I think is a near perfect game, a game that I'm a big fan of recently, Bobble Battle. Bobble Battle just needs a competitive mode and then it's perfect. Snow-covered houses would be very easy to do. Cotton balls are way too expensive, though. We could just put a bunch of snow-covered houses like this. Do you know Furry Hentai Tangrams for the Switch? Never heard of it. Is it any good? We can just billboard. I have no idea how that's going to look billboarded. I have not played any hentai games, guys. It's a furry porn, what do you think? I do not want to talk about it. Look, there's one thing that you can never hate on if you are a creator, especially a program on the Internet. And that is furries. Furries are way too powerful. They're everywhere in tech, especially, and they're very talented. And they're probably in security and IT. They can hack your computer. They can find out where you live. They can kill you. The furries are the one group of people you do not want to mess with. Furries are awesome, exactly. We thought it was the lizard people, and we were right. Almost. You're in the lower rank of non-furry transgender. Also a very powerful position to be in. No one can mess with you either. Other than houses, I don't see many ideas for diorama parts I can do here. That sucks. I kind of want like a snowy mountain or something. What's the lowest position? I can't see. Claymation? Nope. Ice sculpture? We want craft materials. That's kind of nice looking. What's the ice made out of? It's not made out of real ice. That would melt. I really just need ideas for individual assets. I don't want to watch a whole movie. Hmm. What the hell even is this? Sugar cube? Oh wait, that's an idea. Sugar cubes. Oh my god, this is going to be so high poly though. What do ice landscapes even look like? Hmm. Doesn't have to look real, it has to look cool. Yeah. Well, for this level I kind of want things to look real. Popsicle sticks, but they look like cheese. I should think about how to make ice lights rather. That's one important thing. I'm very sleepy. Maybe ice just doesn't work. Maybe ice is just not good. Maybe it should be volcano. But I also don't know how to make volcano. Luigi has been finished for 15 minutes. Oh, I can take a look at Luigi. Oh, he's nice. I like that he looks depressed. Because that's actually very fitting for the star that you do with him. Yeah, I like him. Like baking soda volcano. Yeah, maybe. I don't know.  But this material, I don't know what this is. Paper mache. Oh. How can people always make the volcano in American TV shows? Isn't that boring at that point? By the time the 15th kid did it, you would be bored of it by now, right? Paper mache. Is that how you pronounce it? Maybe. I'm thinking ice is maybe not the way to go. It could be a different biome. We have grasslands, we have mountains, we have a desert. We don't have clouds. We don't have castle. We could make this a castle area. That would fit very well. Maybe I should make this a castle. And then what is this going to be? This could be the ice area or the volcano or something. Is it for the scale model world in the Styrofoam video? Yeah, it's the same world basically. It's not a scale model, it's just a craft world made out of craft materials. I think I'm changing this to a castle biome. And then snow area is gone. Lava area is also not really a thing anymore. Clouds, clouds we can still do. But actually, it doesn't make any sense here. Cave area is still planned, yes. So what do we put here then? I don't actually know yet. And how do you even get there? I also don't know. We should also have a cannon you can shoot somewhere. Cannons are just cool. Maybe the cannon can shoot you over here. Or maybe we give the player a power-up to go there. Maybe a wing cap. I suppose you can do paper chains linking islands. Paper chain? Oh, that's going to be really difficult to platform on. But it could work, yeah. Or just maybe a bit too big to be really full of content. No, it's pretty filled. And if you just look at the first star already, it's pretty nice. We can put some enemies here, some coins or whatever. We get this part. Then this is kind of like a weird platforming thing. You can go here, you don't need to go here. Just purely voluntary. Then you got a rubber band shot here. It's pretty dense, if you ask me. Maybe this area is not very dense, but it doesn't need to be, right? Some enemy is going to be up here. Yeah, this feels pretty dense to me. It is similar to 64-land in how 8-directionally aligned it is. We get the lock rolling section here. I think it's pretty filled with stuff. Yeah, enemies are planned, we just have to program them. What do I do about this part? I need a way to get there. Where would you get there from? Should probably be from here over here somehow. Gives you more options from the start. Chinese paper dragon. Oh my god, that's cool looking. Do we really want that flying around the level? Yeah. What? I have stuff like this. Eh. Hmm. Some of these have not shown us yet, I don't know. I agree, the paper dragon would look cool, but... I don't think it fits well with the gameplay. Recreate a new enemy. That is definitely an option for us. I think we've created a few new enemies actually. What enemies did you write down? Scissors? Cardboard Womp Thwomp Bomb? I was thinking maybe a cardboard chain chomp. Cardboard Spinball and definitely cardboard saw blades. But I think the chain chomp is a no. Paper Mario dragon. This guy. I wonder if there's any enemies that are... Paper Mario 64 that we could use. Anti-Guy? No. Big Lantern Ghost? No. Corrugated Cardboard?  Not sure what that means. Let me google corrugated. Shaped into alternate ridges and grooves. Oh, yeah. Well, we won't know what enemy first before we can do that. Paper Chain Wiggler?  What is a crystal bit? Crystal King? Oh, these are all Paper Mario enemies, even from the newer games. No, it's Reading Leela. I don't watch those. Especially One Piece is completely unwatchable. I think even someone who likes watching One Piece would agree with that. The meat-eating flowers? What is that? What is... This? The piranhas? No. I'm not adding the Koopa Bros. One Piece is best read from Annie's lobby onwards. Yeah, that seems about right. Especially... This happened around Fishman Island. I was watching One Piece with Zayna. I had already read it before. I was just watching it while eating dinner. But the constant sexual stuff in it is just so bad. I don't want to eat every meal with my cock heart. You know what I mean? Why are they doing this in a kid's show? I don't like this at all. Mummies with toilet paper? No. What show? One Piece! Yeah. Do you not know of that, Leela? The show is so weirdly sexual all the time. After the halfway point. And yeah, it's way worse than the anime. In the manga, you can just skip over it. It costs you maybe half a second of your life. In the anime, it will be a full minute-long scene. You can't just skip over it. Is this just a man moment? Well, you can't turn it off. It's a lot of animes. Yeah, a lot of bad animes. Yeah. You can't turn it off. It's not possible. Yeah, I don't think any of those animes would work. But we definitely also still have the womps that we didn't put anywhere. We can put tons of womps here. Yeah. Actually. We can put a womp here. And then... As soon as we're on the side of this building, we can have more options. Yeah. And then we can just make up some bullshit to get up here. I think this is all for today. I think I'm feeling pretty done. I'm just gonna have to make up something to get to the paper plane. And I'm gonna have to make up some castle stuff here. And then we get to the toad. And then we basically have all the platforming done and we can start programming it. There's two more inside areas. But I'm feeling this level we already have a lot of progress. Yeah. I will be seeing you guys in the next stream. Bye.
