Hello Marty! There are not many overworld streams left. You're on the dot, I am. Soon we're gonna only do side-level streams. Hello RixiePersonal! There should be a Goomba rendering around here. Looking for the Goomba. Hello Calitri! When are you gonna make awesome smexy banjo-kazooie hacks? Probably not gonna happen. Is this a boss? No, he's just an NPC. I haven't even played Banjo-Kazooie yet, please keep that in mind. Wait, I didn't even- I didn't even program the Goomba, why would it show? Hello SkyloftSort! In case you're dealing with a headache and a sickness, dang. Playing to add multiplayer? Yes. Why did he look like he was meshing with his hat? Well, he does. He's not a friendly NPC. But he is an NPC and not a boss. It's confirmed to me that both the Poi Fograin and the Ritamurity Axis Sparks that are fixed waiting for next PR- Ooh, nice! I still have wrist issues. It was like decent for two or three days, and now it's worse again. I guess because I didn't pay enough attention to it. So now I'm going to constantly move my wrist around in hopes that it alleviates the issue in the future. You guys are going to have to deal with me being a little slower today. It's like whenever I use a hotkey, by spreading my fingers like this, it hurts. And I think that is what makes the pain worse. Is there a way back to multiplayer because I have an SGO and an MWX5? So if I have like a party at my house or something, we can- Yes! See after finishing all the content, there will be a period where I have to wait for reworks that Biobank's working on, and maybe a little bit of music that's being imported. So during that time period, I am hoping to finish the multiplayer implementation. Hey! The Goomba's exactly where we need him! Did he just- What hit me? Is the Goomba hitting me? What the hell? What? What is hitting me? Hey, Fast64Render actually helps with this multiplayer screen, the TV is made in Accuracy. Well, and Performance. But yeah, I agree that there are still issues in Fast64Render that makes them not very usable right now. Mainly the issue is, I don't see any transparent textures, all the decals just disappear, and sometimes it's just white. But I think they can fix it. Hiltodrongo is very skilled at what he does, and I am confident that he will fix it eventually. On NPC, this guy is a dick. Yeah, he is. Hey, so you know the legality of RomMix? Do you know if using assets from the game in a RomMix is legal? Uhm, no? I am under the impression, as long as you don't put anything new that's copyrighted into the RomMix and you distribute it as a patch file, which only has your changes, that's fine. Do you agree with Dunkey's 10 hottest female Mario character lists? I am not familiar with this list. Name this guy the C&D. What assets will you replace the game with? It would be the main character? Spaceman or some shit? You'll just have to wait and see. Oh, what the fuck? Haha, that's funny, the music. The way it played on YouTube. The pause was just slightly too long. When did you start doing computer science? Because Trigonomaly Autism is still one of my favorite videos of yours. My Trigonomaly Autism? Oh, you mean the optimized sine and cosine functions? I studied mathematics. I think studying computer science is not as helpful for programming as studying mathematics is. I had to take some computer science courses as part of my math degree, and they were all pointless. Okay, I can't punch it for some reason. But the rest works. I think Rum Engine is a good start for rum hacks. That depends on your goal. Meow meow meow meow meow meow You're supposed to kick his rotten tooth. And destroy it. Which alleviates his tooth pain. Kill. Kill again. Pepper brings glory to Discovery. Whenever he's on the brink of tears he wants to go to the bathroom, people give him hand products 哇 Scary times are coming. MAZE Some programs can be written without math. Cool. Some programs can be written without the letter T. Meow meow. Meow meow meow meow. What song is that? I mean, arf arf arf arf. Okay, Lilo. Oh, I think I need to set the X status. Oh, it hurts to type. Idiot. The optimization files lately? The optimization well has run a little dry. I'm not really in an optimization phase right now. I mean, when I rewrote the entire code, yes, I did find a couple of optimizations. And I guess I finished that two weeks ago. Did I finish that two weeks ago? It feels like it's been months. Time isn't real. Bro, why can I not punch him? I need to make that part of the ground flat so that he actually looks fine. No, you're not. You are making him your friend and then you can jump on his nose and he will take you to a secret level. That's how this guy enters a secret level with you. Which I think is a lot cooler. Like that. Stumped in terms of optimization. I wouldn't say stumped, I'm just not spending any time on it right now. There are still a few ideas. There's one really cool idea Sauron had that could probably be like 5%. And then there's the OS-less idea, which is maybe another 0.5%. And then there's the OS-less idea, which is maybe another 0.5%. He looks dead, what keeps him alive? The fire in his heart. That's true, if you're using most of the range, you cannot use that trick. Yeah, it's crazy. The Mario 64 team just was on some shit. Wait. This is the worst Ocarina of Time screenshot I've ever seen. This is not what the game looks like at all. What? You messed up the new FAST64 version? What did you do? AI-generated screenshot? No way, it's the videos from 2 years ago. Is it AI-generated? What so far is in desperate need of optimization? Nothing. Almost everything is perfectly optimized. The only thing, actually maybe you can argue Lip Ultra, because Lip Ultra is written by Nintendo. I just assume it sucks without really 100% understanding it. Because I know who wrote it. Yeah. But one day I will spend time understanding it. But before that, I want to see Soren's and Deathwizard's ideas to replace Lip Ultra with. Do you wanna LOL? What do you mean? Do I wanna LOL? I didn't say that. Do you see an SNES Reminders Mario 64 Remake demo? I have not. What do you mean do I wanna LOL? I have not. Are you asking me if I want to update? I have a snack for you. I acquired an apple. Bye bye. Epic apple. Oh, do you wanna LOL as in do you wanna laugh out loud? Oh my god, now I get it. This song is mildly annoying. This song is mildly annoying. This song is mildly annoying. It will just be another game. It just happens to play a lot like Mario 64, I guess? It's not really following on the actions of Mario 64. Or, sorry, rather. I don't know. Is the can-be-punched-flag-alone-not-enough? No, this guy can definitely be punched. Hmm. Hmm. It's debug print. Maybe I am punching it and it's just not showing because there's no SFX. Will you like hard mode? No, hard mode is antithetical to Mario 64's design, if you ask me. Mario 64 is as difficult as you may get. You get to choose your own difficulty by making more or less risky moves. Oh, it works! Nice. Good work. I approve of your work! I love the skeleton too, it looks very cool. God, it's crazy how good Ocarina of Time is. You ever think about that? You know what I realized about myself? I don't like playing Zelda games, ever, I just like experiencing them. I don't like playing Zelda games, ever, I just like experiencing them. I don't like playing Zelda games, ever, I just like experiencing them. I don't like playing Zelda games, ever, I just like experiencing them. If you had to finish this game, would you do a Saturn homebrew game? No. That is true. Mario 64 looks about outdated on Ocarina of Time. What's the O variable in your code? G current object. It's the S8 register. Yeah, I'm sure that's helpful. It's the actor I'm currently processing. In C++, it would be this pointer. In Python, maybe too. I don't know if Python has that concept. Maybe in Java too? I don't know if it has that concept. I think Java does. I broke his tooth. His tooth is gone. On your birthday, what would it be for you to help get Melee Decom Recom off the ground after you finish? I mean, I'm not really into being a foot soldier, you know what I mean? I like making decisions. And making a decompilation is a lot of just being a foot soldier. It sounds very laborious. My prediction for this game's release date? Your next birthday. You don't need to return here. Well, actually, when I was a kid, I used to play 3DS games with a friend. And my friend was just the one playing. I would just be there, help him solve puzzles and stuff. And I much preferred that way over playing myself. I think playing the game is annoying. It's annoying as hell. I guess I'll do my finely largest for you. Now, what could have caused him to not do that? Oh, I set the action to 4 instead of 2. Obviously, that would cause that. The talk animation, that's 7. I got too excited by the music. Hey, nice eggnog. Today I slept in long, too. Because my baby was awake until like 1am. Right now she refuses to go to sleep. She wants to stay up and play games with Mama and Papa. Okay, that was complete dogshit. Is the flinch animation too fast? Oh yeah, it's fast as hell. Wait, why is he flinching like that? Wait, wait, wait, wait, what? I don't know, I think Zaynab misunderstood the idea. Blah. That kind of works. Good enough. Who pings me? My editor? Oh shit, next video is almost ready? You guys want a quick preview of the next video? I hope you liked that preview. It's your name day today? I guess I will release RtyA today. Hello, ZeroWalt. I don't need to stop the music. Kick him. Okay, that's nice. Zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. What the fuck did I do? Why did I put 7? Welcome to the stream, I invited you to the thing earlier. I don't know if I forgot to bring that up or not. You don't need to be rich to have an editor for YouTube. There is children in India that will do it for you for like $1.50 an hour. That being said, that's not what I'm doing. Meow, meow, meow, meow. So hitting him works, and then he talks to you. The problem is when he talks to you, the camera is nonsense. Three times cheaper than the 14 year old kids in India? I don't think so, man. Probably doing three times better. Dude, it was crazy. When I was looking for an editor, I put like an ad. I was like, yeah, I'll pay something like, what did I say? Like $15 per minute of edited video. That's about what I pay. Or maybe it's like 20, I forgot. A normal video costs me like $300, $400 to make. And then the sponsor brings in the money back. So I can make videos without touching that myself too much. But the editors, there were a lot of people who were into it. I got like 150 applications. And out of those 150 applications, around 100 were from India. And about 45 were from Egypt or other countries around that area. And all the people from Egypt were really racist towards Indians. They were like, whatever you do, don't hire an Indian editor. He's going to scam you. He's going to do a bad job. It was bizarre. When he used to create music for RTY, oh, fortunate that ZeroWorld is in a chat right now. He's making the music boards. Why would an Indian editor do a bad job? I don't know! That's just what the people said from Egypt. Like, almost every single one of them. Did the Indians hate the Egyptian editors? No! The hate was one-sided. How do I get this to look correct? I guess I could use... I might have to spawn a sub-actor to talk to Mario. Did they say in terms of Indians that they're smart? I am not sure. Do I know the Egyptian kid in the end? No! My editor is from the US. I just went with the best person, regardless of where they came from. See, I don't consider race unless there's a reason to. This is a fun thing. So when you have the option to choose between a black doctor and a white doctor, you should pick the black doctor most of the time. Because for the same doctor to be in the same position, he had to overcome more adversity. So you need to be like 10-15% better to be in the same position. So on average, the black doctor is going to be better. In that case, it is rational. And I don't know if I'm allowed to even say this, actually. But this is rational. There is a book about this, by Daniel Kahneman. Thinking fast and slow. Case racism against white people? I'm just being realistic, man. It is the smart option. He hired Yusuf12? No! My editor is LuckyDan. He is someone who watched my videos before being hired as an editor. And I figured he'd be perfect for the job. Man, yeah, okay, that was... Okay. I'm gonna kill you now. Why are you gonna kill Marty for? He didn't do anything to you. Okay, we need to spawn a subvector. Well, we have to. That's what we're doing. Race against white people to balance us out? I wasn't even being racist. That was just a rational decision-making process that I explained. Which is... Poor Marty. Hello, Klayman. Lois makes the stream chat more chaotic, true. I don't know why I'm doing this. Apple is so good, man. Everyone should be eating apples. I don't know why I'm doing this. 100 Noc! I have no idea what this currency is, but thank you for the donation, Erlend. What in the actual fuck kind of Calamar video is someone in the widest possible term watching in order to be recommended makes this video the brango relation or whatever? I am not sure. I am not familiar. What's happening? I am not familiar. Gantz on top of politics. This game is coming out on your birthday! I keep saying it. I know you're a Maple card, so I can't field complaints with you. Norwegian Krona. So how much is that worth? 100 Noc 2 US Dollars. Yo, 10 bucks! Let's go! Are you seeing some Winter Olympics these days? No? You're not finished? Well, we're decorating it right now, so what do you think? Yo, Badoob. Wait, did Badoob subscribe and I missed it? Oh no, I'm sorry. I was like, how did he know Badoob was in chat? So there is a problem here, and that is... this. Just to prevent timing issues. How long will the game be? How many stars and levels? 200. And 3 Bowser levels. Use your money to foist your political reach over the audience? I see. That makes total sense. I'd say around 3-4 times the length of the original game, is what we're looking at. Okay, so there is some problems with that dialogue still. Interesting. Why? Very cool. Yeah, the Bone Dragon is going to be very cool. He's going to be your friend in the end. You'll help him clean his teeth. That is very true, actually. I have... Here in Canada, I basically never hear about Canadian politics. But I do hear a lot about American politics. I literally don't know anyone who talks about Canadian politics. Like, regularly. I've had one person bring them up maybe like 2 or 3 times. But American politics? Every time I go out, someone talks about American politics. It is kind of crazy. I hate that thing. I hate that thing so much. Oh, I know why. It's not actually a timestamp. That's why that happened. No, it should be better. Because American politics is a circus act? No, it's because American culture is so dominant that it seeps into everything else. Every country around the world is slowly adopting American culture. Okay, that's better. It's not moving very dynamically. Oh, because this is computed at the beginning. Okay, I need a special camera cutscene here. Seems to also feel if your arms are shorter, you can't read your lips through the door and have missed it since 2019. Huh. I am sick of American politics and both sides of immigration and I hate all sides equally. I see. That's fair. That's fair. Hello, Zeyna. Yeah, it's a self-defeating act. I don't have time, I'm gonna just mask. Honestly, whatever I played last. I think it's whatever I played last. Minish Cap fucking sucked. I don't like Minish Cap. No, wrong, yes, true. Okay. There's a motion I remember when people were analyzing life in the USA just 10 years ago and everyone was happy they don't live in the USA. Yep. Now everyone is happy, you mean, right? That's good. Okay, that's a little too much distance, but the concept works. Let's add some sounds. Let's do the same thing we did with the T-Rex. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hello, Louch. Time to foam. Here. The raw scene didn't look quite perfect. Striving Minutes, here, take my star. That's nice. Why did I do this? What the fuck? Okay. This is... let's see. I have to start this written down somewhere. BoneDragon10x08. Yep. Okay. Let's go. Okay. That's kind of cool as hell, is it not? I just wish it was easier to see the guy. I don't know if there's much I can do to make him easier to see. I guess I could make him hang out further down during his animation. Probably my only option, really. Yeah, I think it has to be something like this. Okay. Slam animation is also a little too fast, I think. Okay. Okay. I'm fairly certain it is. Based off gameplay. Okay. Does he play his talk animation? Looks like a dark one. Okay. That is so 2000s coded. Hello, Biobank. Welcome to the stream. Biobank, how's Course 15 going? Okay. Oh shit, that's very nice. The water area, then plants, and then the motorcycle. Well, I guess that's a little bit still. It's much lighter work than the main area and the rocket. That's fair. Oh right, the fucking rocket. Oh god. Bro spent weeks polishing a russian rocket, I bet. That rocket is so much work. 2000 was a Yoda deck. What did we get in the 2000 that was so great? Super Smash Bros. Melee, Mario Galaxy 1. Custom Robo Arena? Sonic Adventure? Okay, yeah, the 2000s are great. Nothing in the run- Yeah, I know. I figured it would take a while. In the 2000th century or millennia? I mean, you can argue whatever you want. Wherever you put the decimal point, I guess. We need sounds. Okay. It's being used. I think frame 25 is a good one. It's more like 35, 36, 38. And then this needs a different sound. Something like... Maybe the EO? We'll never call it the 00s, I guess. No, I don't like Minish Cap. I get stuck in two really stupid points, and then I just decide not to play it anymore. The first was, this was after the first dungeon. You had to get past the guards. There were three or four different guards that said you can't get past me, and they blocked your way. And then the fourth guard, when you talk to him, he's like, okay, yeah, I'll let you through. But you have to talk to him first. Why the fuck would I talk to him? So I didn't figure that one out. And then the second one, there were rocks that you can blow away with the wind for some reason. And why the fuck would I try to blow away rocks with wind? Then I decided, I'm not doing this. I'm gonna tilt. What is this world again? Is it video games? True! It's just a big decoy ship. And then last, we need to program a hitbox for him. Is it vegans because they won't eat meat living their life? Or plants are alive too? Well, they do it because they think that having feelings matters. Plants aren't conscious because they are? I don't know. I guess that's fair. Nice, we have sounds. Thank you, the toothed heron is driving me nuts. Oh my god, this is so cool. Now we need a hitbox. That's good. I'm convinced Ocarina of Time is the anti-TikTok. A kid that plays Ocarina of Time will not have any need to ever watch TikTok. Ocarina of Time does the opposite to your brain than TikTok does. That's what I'm trying to say. One heartbox, 500 units in its size. Um... 80 units down. 1000 units in height. And the... Name space? And then we also need to have one a little bit in front of it. I'm gonna copy the art and start with the punch. Why didn't they give OOT a 3D Mantra's Mouse Bunny Hood? That's a little Zuma-coded. That's a little TikTok brain-coded. You're supposed to take it slow. That's why I say playing the game is annoying as fuck. I just like experiencing it, I don't like playing it. I don't think it'll zoom exactly. Dark Souls sounds like it's just a bad patch of Ocarina of Time to me. I feel like I'm born in the wrong generation. Sometimes I wish people have one generation, but if I went so old and tech-legend, I'd hardly ever possibly share gaming experience with them. I think you know too many old people, that's the problem. What the fuck are you talking about? What? Sorry, is this... Giga racist book or what is this book about? The way you worded it, it sounded like you were recommending the most racist book of our generation to me. It was history and conflict between the races. I don't really care about history. See, people say, oh you need to learn history to learn from it and then no one fucking does. And then also half the stuff you learn from history is just fucking obvious. That's, yeah, this is my genuine belief. Bro you are doomed to repeat it. Yes, but not because of my own volition, it's because of other people. Bro doesn't like anything. I do like things. What do you mean? No coding kinda sucks. I like making things. I like making new experiences and expanding my brain. I think if you get hit by this guy you should be taking full damage. He has such a big attack, three damage is warranted. Twenty years it's Slenderm, it's only been fourteen years. Oof. Zayna's not a thing? What? Nice, it works, we got a hitbox. Why did he not talk to me? Oh, because I was underground. Wait. That should be hitting me. Am I using the tooth position? I am. Meow meow meow meow. Turned into a cat again. Guys, I will make a vow to not turn into a cat for the rest of the stream. Oof. Add containment, true. A good compilation of cat. That seems fine. That's kinda cool. I think phase one of Bone Dragon works. This is a problem. The problem is fixed. Oh, right. I should be using this instead. Alright, with this we can move on to phase two of Bone Dragon, where you give him a gold tooth. Actually, I forgot one. I think I want him... Do we want him to talk? No. I don't want him to talk to Blair. That changed my mind. I like that he's just a monster. Alright, let's see how he acts. We need to program him after that. What if he always has the star within his mouth, floating, until you perform a percentage on him? That way you can see then it's a potential star. I could add a star shine to the tooth, but I kind of like the way it is right now. Nah, a star shine is a good idea. Let's do it. You are correct. Let's do it. Boring stuff being detailed in English shouldn't be a big enough clue to Blair that there would be something to get out of him. Yeah, but I like the extra hint. It is true that I personally was wondering how to make sure the player thinks to break his tooth. Let's make sure it shows up right. Oh ho ho ho. It is kind of cool. I have a better idea than what I just did. It should be like this. I got a new phone recently for a YouTube sponsorship. I don't know what to do with the phone after. I'm just going to sell it and try to get as much product again. I tried to get my ROM-Mac running on it and it's impossible because Android emulation is just too inaccurate. It's kind of crazy. It's kind of all delayed by one frame. Which makes sense, actually. What phone is it? I don't know if I want to say it because that's free advertisement. You know what? The fact that you can see the star, I'm fine with it for now. We'll just add that to the to-do list for the polishing. There's a phone that can't run Mario 64. No, it's not the phone that can't run Mario 64. It's the emulators that can't run my ROM-Mac. Hello, Monadono. The phone... See, it can't... All the shitty emulators can't run RTYI. I can run a Windows emulator on the phone and then via the Windows emulator run Simple64, which can run RTYI, which is crazy. So I have to emulate an emulator to emulate the game. Crazy that the phone can run... yeah. When the sponsor will appreciate you uninstalling the program that comes with the phone. I have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, GTA 6 got leaked. Wait, what? Owl? A Fire TV stick? Wait, what? Years ago... huh. Nope, I don't know where you got that from. The change I made to Grand Theft Batman? No, not really. Oh look, he's friendly! He now has blue eyes. And he's missing a tooth. We should make it so that if you come close to him, he says something like, I miss my tooth. Oh, that was already planned, cool. No, it doesn't. I tried so hard. And it didn't work! It's so shit. Do you guys have any idea how shit Android emulators are? Alright, my pin is 1234. Look, I got it to run RTYI on here. And it like, kind of works. I can run around, and I died. This is not the demo by the way, this is the full version. Yeah, Parallel just doesn't work on the phone. Parallel just crashes. But this is running Simple64, which is a super accurate emulator, that even lags for many people. I can maybe show you how Ares runs on my PC, just to give you a rough idea. We're just making shit up now. We're just saying shit. Right, this is what Ares looks like. And even my PC doesn't have a super easy time running this. Let's drop there for a second. Let's go to a more expensive level. Oh, I guess my PC... Ah! There you saw a lag. 51, yeah. 34. My PC can only run this at half speed. Which is about the same speed the phone runs at, which is fucking insane. What the fucking... What are we doing here? Guys, are you destroying... Am I being rage baited? Huh? What do you think I'm optimising the game for? I'm being rage baited. I need to be zen. This is the completely wrong place. No, it's not. I feel like unless Parallel will be made workable in the game, the game is going to get a lot of negative review. Possibly. I mean, it seems to work on Parallel on computer. Kind of. I mean, I kind of don't give a fuck if people play the game on Parallel and Parallel has bugs and it doesn't work. That's just Parallel's fault. As long as it works on N64 and the emulator I recommend, it is what it is. If Parallel is such a small microcosm of the SimpleFlips fan community, then it's just whatever. Well, I guess actually there is a rule on romhacking.com that you need to make sure your Romhack works fine on Parallel. So if it doesn't work on Parallel, I will just not upload it there. That's what I'll do. That's what I'll do. You know what, actually I'm going to upload it and then right after I upload it, they're going to update Parallel and break it again. They always do this. My plan doesn't even work. I don't care and I don't know. I don't want to think about B. I just want to make my game, man. The idea that it wouldn't be more popular than B is insane to me. There's like 300,000 people on my YouTube channel waiting for it. 1,500 is quite low. Much lower, or quite high. Much higher than I thought it'd be. They're going to make Project 64. Luna's Project 64. Or a real N64. Or Iris. Or Simple64. Anything that's not completely awful. The fact that people use a retroarch-derived emulator is crazy. I mean, maybe it works. Let's try. Oh, I don't have Parallel installed. Good. I can try. The emulation scene is such a fragmented mess. I mean, kinda. Project 64 is doing its own thing. But Iris and Simple64, I think they're working fine together. I think I need to get the player even closer, otherwise this is going to be obstructive. And annoying. Yeah, people used 1.6 for a really long time. And the emulator I'm using here is derived of 1.6, just with some improvements. Retroarch is pretty bad, guys. The way I understand it, you cannot update retroarch, it's not open source. So when you want to make changes to it, it's super difficult or something? I don't know. But that's what Iris explained. And also on retroarch, there's no plugin that actually works with my controller. So I can't actually control Mario. And also, you're bound to fucking retroarch, which has the worst UI ever. It is so bad that people made Parallel Launcher. Which works specifically just so you don't have to interact with retroarch's UI. But it's still there, and it's comically bad. It's like purposely bad. The way retroarch's UI works. I had to set up retroarch on my phone to try and get RTYI to run, and it is the worst experience ever. That's because they're using... what's it called again? Not specular. Maybe it was specular? They were using a feature that x3 has, that is not supported on emulators yet. Retroarch is open- Really? Okay, I was just fucking lied to then. That's crazy. Something with the talk animation is still weird, the way it teleports. The issue I had with mine was that people on Reddit would like the most random plugins ever. That would make the entire background disappear. Yeah, that's the one advantage in Parallel Launcher and romhack.com. That you can set which plugins work. And I suspect that's the main reason people are willing to put up with Parallel Launcher. Are you using x3configure or just get the game and play? I'm planning to release the game together with a pre-configured emulator. So that you can just download the exe and play. Maybe even like a recompilation version with Wiseguy's recompilation, which also just plug and plays. Okay, that's a little better. Idea for the animation, how Mario whips out a Gameboy and you hear Gameboy noises. There is a character that does that. But no, I don't want to give Mario a Gameboy. It would be funny though. It feels a little dissonant from the rest of the game though, right? You're saving the Yoshis and he just whips out the Gameboy. What do you think people in real life would do? Imagine you need to walk a thousand miles. How many miles can a person walk in a day? 24? 25? Realistically? Imagine you have to walk 2500 miles. A hundred day walk. And on the way you have all the water and food you need. But you also have entertainment with you. Like you can sit down and watch Netflix. And you need to walk this entire way. And while you're walking, your entire family is being tortured. Meaning yes, you can take a break and watch entertainment during these 100 days. But it means every single minute that you spend enjoying, your entire family is being tortured. Do you think people would walk the entire 100 day walk right away? Or would they take breaks to entertain themselves? Nice, Caleb. This is way too dark. You already take leaps to rest and figure out a way to occur themselves while walking. You don't think they'd just watch Netflix for a bit? I don't think so. A biobank just finished polishing his rocket. And now he is... Polishing his plants. And now he is... Polishing his plants. Let me see, family, can I volunteer my external time because I don't have a proper time? No, only the family members you care about are being tortured. Okay, so the next step is you need to be able to give him a gold tooth. And once you do that, he becomes your friend. And once he's your friend, he will lead you up here. Where you will enter a side level. The thing is, how do you give him the gold tooth? We were originally planning there's like a smith here that can make one for you. Very nice, now he's blue after calming down. I was initially thinking there'd be a smith that leaves Grandsand Badland after you beat Grandsand Badland. But I'm no longer convinced on that. If you want to make a side level, you are very very much invited. I am definitely looking for other people to make more side levels for me. Green is the friendliest color? Oh, he's blue. So what I had planned here initially was one of the Monty Moles, let me see if I can find one. Would you like to make a side level, Sunny? Which one? It'd be these guys here. But they don't really feel like smiths, do they? It's so cool to be able to move around on your own now. Would you like to make one? Would you like to make one? Can you 3D model well enough is the question. Oh, I will also say that if you do make a side level, you will have to consent to me possibly rearranging your level. It is very likely to happen. Sam is currently making one and her level looks pretty cool so far. She's making the gravity one. What the hell? Sometimes the collision in this game just doesn't work for objects. I mean, I can show you the list of side levels here. That we still need. Let's see. We got a Golf Mario level. Bowser's Golf Course is the plan, I guess. It's going to be in the sky and Golf Mario means you go into cannons and then you have to shoot through holes, basically. We have a Rising Lava side level, which is where the Bone Dragon brings you. We have Bowser's Yacht, which is just Bowser having a ship that's like a tanker. We have the Conspiracy Theory Yoshi's House. This one is really just a secret cave, basically. There's not really much level to it. We have a Manta Ray Surfing level. A timed linear level. We have a Wing Cap based level, that we don't really have a concept for yet. We have a Cloud Cap based level. We have the Yoshi Race Stadium, where you race on the back of an athlete Yoshi. And there's three different stadiums, basically. We have the Shy Guy Seeks level, which is around a large tree where you have to play hide and seek with five shy guys and they make noises. A Rolling Pinball level. Maybe a Pepperfruit based level. Maybe Shell Diving Against a Shark. And the Big Planetary Gravity level that Sam's making. Those are the ones that we still need. That's quite a lot. Yeah, but I would all make them relatively quickly, because they're all small. Except for the Race Yoshi level, that one I suspect takes a bit. I did hear about it and I updated it. I verified I'm not hijacked. There's a Pepperfruit in this game here that makes you run faster. It's very similar to the Spicy Fruit Mario Galaxy. It can be a Waluigi Pinball level. You know, I had the idea that there would be a place to just drop coins in. Maybe that would be this place. Maybe there could be a lava pit where you drop coins in. Imagine there's like a hole here and there's a lava pit in the text. And you talk to the text. And the text just says something like... Drop in coins and something good will happen. And you go there and it asks you how many coins would you like to drop in. And you go there and it asks you how many coins would you like to drop in. And then after you drop in like 2000 coins or so, it spawns a tooth for the Bone Dragon. Well, whatever you're feeling passionate about, Sunny, let me know. I think we're making the money hole. Fuck it, money hole. I think we're making the money hole. I think we're making the money hole. Will the tooth float up in the pile of money? Or is it just gonna pop out? It'll just kinda pop out and then the hole closes permanently. Who'll be ending me? And this. Alright. The ones I would be most passionate about are like organic, forest, plains and nature-based. These ones always turn out best for me. If you wanna do that, then the Shy Guy Seeks one would be great. Or the Shy Guy one. Which is... This one here. So the idea with this level is that... Let me show you where it is in the overworld. It would be around here in the overworld. You would enter something here and then be around the base of this tree. And there's five colored Shy Guys here. And each time you find one, he gives you a hint as to where the next one is. And once you find all five, you get a star. So you'd basically just make a little circle with a bunch of hideouts for the Shy Guys. Does that make sense? Alright. There are characters in the game called the Three Dipshits. They are the villains of Course 6. The Three Dipshits Yes, definitely start with an Artstyle first. I was thinking the area would be a little swampy and have a lot of blacks and greens. But no. You can't reappear when you enter a level? Yes. How long are you planning to stream today? I don't know. More monotone areas are always easier to make than colored ones, so I'm bringing the idea of... It can be a little bit of color, but yeah. I think you get the idea. More monotone areas. More monotone areas. More monotone areas. Yikes. That's nasty. But we're avoided. Okay, nice. More monotone areas. More monotone areas. Fuck it. I can redo the UV map. This is not the real theme. That's not the real ending theme, I'm not great with time. Is it case or case? Who knows. More monotone areas. Will there be a version where you can see how excited the manual is? Possibly. I haven't decided on that yet. More monotone areas. I don't know what you have in mind for this. I feel like I went over the list twice now. So I'm not really sure what you're asking. Also, what is this? You said you don't really like playing Zelda games. Yep, that is true. This is factual information. Particles. For what? Oh, the money hole. That's a good idea, maybe. I mean, that would be an easy way of doing it. More monotone areas. More monotone areas. Bring it on, Sir. Export a character? Oh, no. That was the wrong button. Does it matter? Did anything happen? Okay, we're safe. Hello, GamesMetly. Bienvenido. See you, Clayman. I found out what the longest word in the world was just recently. You wanna hear it? It's a German word. As you would expect. Although it's kind of cheating, because it's just a compound word. Like, it's a compound, compound, compound, compound, compound word. I think I've heard it. Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz What the hell? Why would you put that in a dictionary? You can do this with everything. Haustür, Schlüssel, Hersteller, Geschäftsleitungsführer You know, it's whatever. You can do this with everything. Donaudampfschifffahrzelektricitätshauptbetriebswerkbauunternehmensbeamtengesellschaft Yeah, exactly. Why even bother putting this into the dictionary? This word is in the Guinness Book of Records. Oh, but that's such a cheat. Donaud is a word, Dampf is a word, Schiff is a word, Fahrt is a word, Elektricität is a word. It's all these separate words you put together. Anyone can do this. I can make an infinite word. Wait, how do I make an infinite word? I'm sure there's ways to do it, but I don't want to spend the brainpower on it right now. Approach the money hole and throw in your money. Who knows, something good may happen. There should be like a glass platform in the middle of this that starts sparkling. Does it even matter to record it on? No, I don't need to record it, I can just describe it. This is funny. Is Mario moving? How do we control the money hole? Motion engine? No. Emanuel engine? What? That's a random thought. What the fuck does that mean? If we put a glass platform in the middle, then you can stand on to throw the money in. You guys ever drift off to sleep and then something makes you awake again? And you remember the thoughts that were still in your brain before you were about to fall asleep? And you were like, what the fuck was I going on about? What you're describing sounds like that to me. What if there's just a glass platform at the beginning here and you can use that? Let me grab the glass combiner from the Belza level. Anyone else making unnecessary zonative files? I have no idea. It just is what Windows does. I want to hear me make the thing. There we go. Actually, before I copy this, let's do that just so we don't blow up the file. Actually, I should be doing this every time. That's so much smarter. Okay, that kind of works. And then here could be a text that asks how much money do you want to throw in if you are in this area. And then there's just an animation of that money being thrown in. I think that works. Let's try it. Wait, how do we do the selection menu? Do we just print it? I guess we can do that. Yeah, should be fine. We'll let you throw in like 999 coins at once. So natural. Now I like money. I like the implication that you're actually just throwing away all your valuables. Gold kind of makes sense too. But money feels more like something that would be happening in real life. No one actually collects gold in real life. Or very few people do. I don't know if that's a good reasoning, but that's why I want to put money. Okay. Oh, we need to store somewhere how much money the player has put into this. Oh, that's going to be annoying. Okay, I need to do this in a special way. We'll do it this way. Okay. Okay. So you literally pay for this bone dragon's new teeth. I think that's kind of cool. Come on, I have the exact behavior I need somewhere. It's basically just this again with some cosmetics. Okay. Okay. Still, that's not all right. What do you mean? You can have any reason you want to move bits. I think your question is too newbie for me to understand what your question is. Okay. I can't think of a use case, but if you only want to look at the upper bits... Okay. That was weird. The emulator just does that sometimes, so I'm not too worried about it. The restarting just there. Also, this should be centred horizontally. So, it's the 120, and 104... Actually, 100. Ah, 96. So, you have the smaller bit again. This is the money hole, and you put money in it. It's almost where I want it. I don't get it. It's a hole, and you throw money into it. You ever seen a wishing well? Put too many coins in the game? No. It's just a hole, and you throw money into it. You gotta do something with your coins. Broken economy. Yeah. Is it not fun to find a hole and throw money into it? Have you checked Analog3D since... When did that come out? Was it last week? If so, then yes. It's still fucked. Nice. So now you make a donation, and it throws the money in there. And then if you throw enough in, you get the gold tooth for the bone dragon. Someone will love it. Yep, you throw in the money, and it just burns up. You get to literally burn your money. But you get a gold tooth in the end, and you give that to your friend. And then your friend is happy. This is a funky Zelda remix. What are we listening to? Zarya-Song-Spooky-Groovy-Remix So, to do that, you need to use a joystick. Actually, just buy a joystick. I don't understand a lot. You can come to your own conclusions. Do you understand who put the wibbly-wobbly thing into Hazy Maze Cave that lets you go into the metal cap? Do you understand who put Dory in the metal cap into Hazy Maze Cave? Do you understand who... There's many questions in Mario 64, man. Who put the star in the wall? Do you need answers? Do you not have your own creativity? Does Mario's skin get older every year? I'm just a liar, man. Last year, I said I was 29. This year, I say I'm 30. Make up your mind. Wasn't all Bowser and his Goombas? Why would they do that? Do you not have space for Whimsy in your heart? Anyway, I think I'm done for today. Next time... Well, next time, I'll probably already have the entire Gold Dragon mission done. We need to brainstorm some more for Poochie, because he probably has to give you a star. And then we really, really start on the side levels. And once the side levels are done, the game's finished. The minimum viable product is finished. So it feels very close. I am fairly confident that this year we are going to finish minimum viable product. But there's still a lot of reworks to be done. So I don't think we will finish the entire game this year. Unless Biobank... Unless someone buys him a lot of Adderall or something and forces him to work. But we don't want that either. Actually, I also still need to add multiplayer, so that will happen after minimum viable product. Maybe also this year. Probably. But no promises. So, until then, bye bye!
