you you hello you oh I'm wet we're looking spicy that is a spicy word but that's not what I'm working on today hello Leira fish boy hello tiny man I don't handle for life hello Papil Kachafa let's see what we're working on today the crabs I think the super happy tree seedling the old man the crabs the F you going on yeah AI generated sentence YouTube no no text autocomplete as sentence you go keys go Novi condo write last dream we worked on the secret path I don't they put the secret path Oh right here Hello be savory hello everyone can wait for the next fbdx 3 version I Don't know anything about a new version Hello, did it's I? Think saying I was working on a big super heavy tree, so let's not work on the ceiling for now We need to say no for the old man as well. We need it for the crabs What do we not need it for the rainbow slide? Oh, no, we need we need a nice Yoshi houses Oh my God, then are you holding up the whole thing? I don't think I can do anything on here. We need to work on the underwater system Everything here is blocked by Zayn That's fine. It's not working on this you Yeah, baby you But that is like four different tasks. I can't start one right now because of that it is all annoying But I'm sure we can do something at least you What thing you're calling my baby a thing you're a thing Are you like that? being called a thing You are also a thing that's depressing you This is a women are objects drug. Is that the joke is your woman you're a thing an object? or flashback Yikes you Hello payment guys I need I Need an evaluation of the situation So there's this guy He comes by our house, and he stays for a A long time he just comes to our house and stays there for a while, so I Talked to him, and he says he does it because he wants to watch the train The guy is clearly a bit awkward. I think he is very autistic the question is Should I worry because like We are in a cul-de-sac, and he just parks his car there, and it is a bit spooky And who knows what he might do Maybe he's like a Nintendo spy who knows The guy that scares ain't us that In a stat seems somewhat convinced the guy is a danger Interest them and told him to me. He's making you uncomfortable I I Did talk to him yes, and I was like what the fuck are you doing? and It looks like he knows he's making people uncomfortable It looked like it wasn't the first time someone talked to him because He said to me. I'm just here to observe the trains to go to run an experiment on trains is what he said And I asked him what's an experiment that he said I want to see how far away I can hear the train But he also like said very loudly. Oh to everyone else here. I don't want anything bad I just want to watch the train and I am inclined to believe him But who knows there's weird people out there Go watch some trains with them. I don't want to watch the train I think I'm donating your hair. It's almost 14 inches and a ponytail should you donate it I? Have no idea Do you want to keep your hair I wouldn't want to keep my hair Sounds annoying to have hair So if it feels like it's not the first time asking if you can do this experiment elsewhere off of your property just for peace Of mind, it's like the fifth time. He was there twice like yesterday once in the morning and once in the evening And the first time it happened was like half a year ago, so this is like a routine thing for him And then I used to put cider blocks on the train tracks and watch the trains plow into them Did you try to kill everyone on the train? That sounds like it could destroy the train Hello Selden It's fucking morons, oh I see it's a free country he pays his taxes I See Trespassing him well before that we will just tell him normally like go away You You Well imagine if the train broke and Like you killed 200 people You'd be in so much trouble Dude, we would still hear about you on the news if that happened You know, I guess I was with those trains plowing through semi trucks and not getting derailed Wait, then why are people talking like oh don't kill yourself on train tracks because you might Harm other people. Oh That doesn't make any sense given that context You Never had anyone say that I've heard that it's like a common sentiment Oh, or is it like you might traumatize the person driving the train I Guess that's possible. I Think while I was in school actually like two people from my school killed themselves on the train tracks And have a lot You Maybe then way worse things than doing sprints and train noises Where is this coming from? You Maybe it's just the usual people trying to find any reason to justify You acting according to what they want you to act like and then they just make up shit You Dude it's like adults that don't want kids were swearing Every time you ask someone why shouldn't kids swear? They're like because they will get in trouble with other adults That's literally the only answer I've ever heard and it's like Okay, so they're getting in trouble because you think that they might get in trouble for doing this like you can You can do this with any behavior like don't say hello because the other adults will be upset at you and Then you just get upset for them saying hello because the other people will get upset at them for saying hello. It's just a sensible People who swear can't be trusted that is false everyone swears I Guess no one's can be trusted. Anyway, fair enough. I Don't think the act of swearing has anything to do with it though Let me write about that I'm right about that. So you do it. No, I need people to disagree with me. Tell me why I'm wrong You If no one tells me I'm wrong we don't learn anything This is not how it's supposed to go The way it's supposed to go is I say something stupid and then you guys are like, but actually case It's like this and I have to be like, oh that makes sense That's how it's supposed to go. You can't just say you're right You We don't for the character I love never swears once interesting I guess he's a very trustworthy character You it's what she told me You don't you I was thinking about almost anything I only understand oh, okay fair enough You These are the people whose America's that it'd be much less representative because they don't hide their opinion interesting Suddenly this out-of-character no longer sounds so trustworthy, huh? You know what I think? I think people don't want children. They don't want children to swear because they want children to be cute. And they think swearing is not cute. It's 100% selfish. Of course, being trustworthy and being seen as trustworthy probably have a very weak correlation. There's probably random characteristics like being 6'5 that is more correlated with being trustworthy than being trustworthy. Okay, so are you going to release another demo before the game comes out? Probably not, but I might do another mini-hack that's got nothing to do with RTYI but uses the RTYI engine. It's not as annoying to work on. I'm going to call it Unreal Engine 64 because it's got nothing to do with Unreal Engine. It's noobstamping and saying, fuck, that means something is annoying on the internet. I guess it's a bit of a problem when it gets them asking where the word comes from. Oh, what about shit? That's not a problem at all. Everyone knows what shit is. I don't remember as kids we would say, fuck you, without knowing what fuck is. And we never thought about what fuck is at all. So one day, our parents asked, do you even know what fuck means? We had to be like, actually no. Okay, it's similar with the word gay. I remember my brother calling people gay and he didn't know what it meant until my mom asked him, do you even know what gay means? And he said, it means you're stupid. And he had no idea what it actually meant. And we got my sister a bitch in Polish because I didn't know there exists a word like this. Interesting. I mean, okay, what does bitch even mean? Because the translation of bitch in German, when I learned the word, also translated it to the word whore, as in someone who rinsed out their genitals. So for the longest time, I thought bitch meant whore, but evidently it means like female dog. Is that right? It just sucks. Sorry, but only 4 people on earth use the term bitch that way. Elite dog trainers. Yeah. Sorry for 7 minutes, because I was on the bus going there and I was just in a mood. Someone inside looked up at the bus, saw me, waved hi and smiled, and I flipped off. Well, okay, I was specifically talking about the German word gay, which did not mean happy. It just meant homosexual. I don't know what you're making, it doesn't make any sense in this context anyway. Hurra-ba. Is that how you pronounce it? That one seems to stem from images of women trying to use their body parts, or starting to be used as insults, because I would say some part in the 3rd commandment. What's the 3rd one? Don't have any other gods, don't lie, honor your parents, don't kill, don't steal, don't be jealous, don't have false gods, don't lie, did I mention that one already? Make sure to rest on Sundays? Yeah, I don't know all the commandments. Kill non-believers? I don't think that's a commandment. You don't need to make a commandment of that if it logically follows from the other ones. You shall not take the lord's name in vain? No, it's not cursing. Okay, wait, taking the lord's name in vain and cursing are two different things. Taking the lord's name in vain is just one specific way of cursing. You know what, I want this to be bricks. Let's just make a new material. Meant to not kill your fellow Jews? I'm not sure that's true. I have actually read a lot of the Old Testament, and I know that a fair few times God had to explicitly allow the Israelites to kill people. So I don't think it's just allowed. It's only allowed with permission. Flip on? That's one thing, Sonny, but yeah, that's the common thing. The most common one and most offensive one is the Spanish word for black, obviously. I can nag you. Bro, my Fast64 is so slow again. Am I on the right renderer? Do you see how I have to wait like five seconds for anything to happen? I'm on the wrong renderer. Let's try Fast64 renderer. This guy wrote this song in 20-piece chicken nuggie yesterday. What a banger. It goes chicken nuggie, chicken nuggie. Your girlfriend wants it sexually because I have 20-piece chicken nuggie. I'm open for suggestions. Okay. Is there any snowfall yet? I woke up to about five minutes ago this morning and I'm in the Midwest. I don't know what the Midwest is, but no, I hope not. Wait, isn't the Midwest the region that's like slightly east of London alone in the US? Oh, we're from the Midwest. Okay. Is this the original? You know what? This immediately sounds way better. We're off to USA. This is the Mideast. This is East. I've got a fox. It's surprising that you had snow, though. Maybe you live further north than me somehow? Maybe the ghost stream something something heating up the air? Did I night at the beta museum and you heard my voice? I have a faint memory of voicing something for robots, but I don't know what I did. God, I want a new Paper Mario so bad. Actually, right now. Could you imagine if they made a good Paper Mario game again? Oh, that would be sick. Hey, phone guy, you did a good job. Also, it doesn't feel like Mario 64 has a new game. Oh, I see. Okay, I see. Do you realize that it took me four years to find the paperwork OST? I don't know what that is. So, um, no. Finding an OST shouldn't be a problem. I would think that you haven't really been searching. Man, I have a new video ready about the exclamation box optimizations. And I'd love to upload it, but I need to wait for Raycon. We're sponsored by Raycon this time. Raycon earbuds. And then after that, I have a video about illegal N64 rendering techniques. And that one's actually going to be a banger. But I don't think anyone will understand what I'm talking about. But I will think it's a banger. Oh, neither did Metaseum was updated today. That's good. Robot's a bit of a cloud chaser, but in a good way. Like, you know, it's one thing to only make the things that you want to make. It's another thing to make the things that other people want to see be made, right? And just making the things that you want to make is easy. But making the things that other people want to see be made is also something that is a good thing. A lot of people are quick to clown on Unreal Mega that would do something like that. But I like it. The Beta Museum is definitely one of those things that I'm sure he feels no passion for. That other people wanted to see be made. I need the money, bro. I have family. At this point, I'm only making videos if I have a sponsor. Just because the opportunity loss of not making a sponsor video is so huge. Like, if one single video I make can be literally equal to a full month's salary, I don't want to miss out on that, man. Let's set it for the decals on the hats. You go to the combiner and you set this to transparent decal. I think that would get a programmer fired. Sorry, what? What would get a programmer fired? I feel like I missed a part of the conversation. Nothing else. If it's a two cycle material, you also need to go to lower and then set random modes in part 1 to no-op or pass. Actually, put it to pass. No, put it to no-op and then cycle 2 to transparent decal. Any cost of not doing OnlyFans? Yes, but also the cost of doing OnlyFans, you know. Yo, what up? Thank you for the 40 months, RioluBro. Holy shit. Dude, I saw a SimpleFlips short today. Is he getting into the shorts game? Is SimpleFlips Industries finally starting up again and he's starting to make content again and stuff? That'd be awesome. He's kinda been gone from the scene for a bit. The community has been in remiss. Shambles. Dude, you should see the romhacker discords. Like, oh my god, the Mario64 romhackers, they're all like, why isn't SimpleFlips coming back to grace us with his presence? We miss him so much. We don't know how to make romhacks unless SimpleFlips tells us what the romhack is about. It's kind of crazy. And there's people out there, the romhack community is dying because SimpleFlips is not telling us to make romhacks anymore. I'm strawmanning the fuck out of them, but that's what it boils down to. Noble of their own true. NPCs to their own life, can you believe it? You're out here with the ability to make a game and you're just not doing it. Unbelievable. Alright, let's see how that works out for the other sections. Okay, 50% of my audience is autistic. If I'm sarcastic without telling you guys I'm autistic, a good chunk of you guys are going to be like, what? He believes that? No way! This guy's an asshole. This guy's an asshole. Fine, let's just stick with an arrow punch, that's a smart idea. It's just the wrong level. Oh my god, this level exit is so cool. This is how you come out? That's awesome. I didn't even think about that. Right, how about putting this back? Oh my god. Oh yeah, I added a new feature recently that makes it so that anywhere in the world where you save, that's where the game starts the next time. So if I collected the star in the level I was just in, the next time I boot the game up, I start right over there, at the level exit. Or when I save at the save block over there, that's where I start next time, at the save block. I think that's going to make this feel so much more like you're on a travel, on a journey. Unlike Mario 64, where you restart. You guys get what I mean? So there is going to be a submarine here, and you will have to jump into it to enter this level. Oh, it's not about quality of life, it's about the vibe. About the feeling of being on a journey. That's the wrong warp. Wrong warp. Let's see, this should be 0x41. And it should lead to 0x36. Or 0x34. There we go, wrong warp fixed. Next we're going to add the submarine here. There's one potentially annoying thing about this, and that is... If people swim down here... That's going to stop them from doing that. I feel like this belongs over here. That was bizarre. Yeah, so I don't want people to just swim down into the depth here. So what we could do is we could add a gate that only opens up once you jump into the submarine. That might be the correct decision. Okay, let's remove all the unnecessary warps first. We need 5, we need 1. We don't need 2 forwards, what the hell. We don't need 3. We don't need 2. Who are programming the overworld? Me! Subanimation's joint limbs, because when I try to do that, what I just saw works only my limbs get disjointed. It does. Well, it doesn't. But the thing is, you don't need to support that. F3D just naturally allows for it, even if you don't support for it. If it doesn't work for you, you did it wrong. Or the tool you're using exports the thing wrong. Dude, we have a new cool feature, too, that I didn't even show you yet. Look at this. When I reset the game, there's a reset animation playing. You see that? Okay, it's always the same on Project 64, because Project 64 is kind of terrible. But if I use this emulator here... Ah, sad, it doesn't work either. But it works on a real N64, and that's what matters. That's like different animations that happen, the way the screen blacks out. And if anyone has more ideas for animations that we should put there, I can add them. But you have to keep in mind, all the animations are exactly 28 frames long. Because it is the reset button that triggers the animation. TV turning off effect? How would that look? Oh wait, but it's like when you press the reset button, right? Not the turn off button? Someone turning off makes sense. How does this look? I like that. Oh, that's cool, like a star shape that closes. I should add that. I like this. I can't play on a real N64 because you're mounted at the bottom of yours. That's fine, if you're playing on a very accurate emulator, you might still hit the enemy. Are you rendering these? Okay, so there's a thing here. I mean, I'm going to yap for a little bit. When you turn off the N64, you can no longer do most things. You can't render, you can't do any cartridge access, you can't use the RSP, you can't DMA anything. But you can write directly to the framebuffer. So all these animations have to be rendered by directly writing to the framebuffer. They're basically pure math formulas. And they have to be relatively simple. Because if they're too complex, of course you can't put them in a math formula. So we have one animation where it's like a diagonal like this. We have one animation where there's multiple squares that grow, like 48 squares. We have one animation where the screen is like a clock circle. And we have one animation... We have one more animation. Ah, maybe... In a spiral. Oh yeah, like the screen shrinks. While I'm jumping, I'm grabbing the top of the screen to pull it down. It's possible, I mean I can read RAM. If I had a Mario sprite, but it has to be 28 frames exactly. That's crazy autodidact. I wish I had a 25% salary increase. I wish I had a 25% salary increase. Let me make something that looks good in one second. Yeah! Like a little Mario jump sprite. Well, actually I guess the problem is... If we drew a sprite like this and had him jump across the screen, we would get solitaire. That's the problem, you get the solitaire effect. I guess you can also clear the pixels around him back to what they were in the previous framebuffer. It's possible. What are the fills of the screen? It kinda has to go to black. The problem with turning any pixels that were previously black into non-black again is you have to back up all the data. But it's technically possible. You can back them up in a different framebuffer, no problem. I don't know what I was doing here. You guys have very complicated ideas. I was hoping you would just drop a math formula in the chat. Shit. But I guess it makes sense that I would have to do those things. Can you melt the screen to black, like all the pixels slowly melt to black? It's possible. It's possible. But it's possible and I'm willing to do it. It's always two separate issues. It's possible. It's possible. It's possible. Do my wipes transition to BS? Let's see. Luma wipes. Lumba? No, Luma. Oh god. Oh god. Oh, I was hoping you guys had simpler ideas than this. Good old OBS. I'm scared that if I touch my OBS it's going to crash. I'd rather not touch it. Meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh. What are the lyrics to this song? What are the lyrics to this song? Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ew. Okay. Okay. Okay. Ew!  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I can't believe that 5 years after we programed the submarine we have to do it again, like it was there and then it disappeared and now it's back. Oh my god, it exists twice, once in capital and once in not capital. Goddammit. Where did the little girl go? That's so real, what a woman. Dude, do you guys know how much water the average human household uses in a day? Don't google it, just guess. Give me guesses. How much water the average household uses. In the west here. 80 gallons? 300 gallons? How would you use 300 gallons of water in a day? Okay, you guys are putting stupidly high guesses out, it's going to make the real number look stupid. Fuck you. Filling your pool? How do you use 100 gallons a day? It doesn't make any sense. I use Ubuntu right here. I'm never asking shit anything again. Yep, guys, I just drank another 2 gallons, just like that. I need for us to be drained and refilled with amazing ghost spirit, of course. How many gallons have you drank during the stream? Like 5? Just chilling. We just all collectively spent 2000 gallons watching the stream. Oh, by the way, test results for Course 10 are back. Game fucking sucks, it's the result. But that's fine, it was only the second test. It can be a lot better. A gallon is 4 liters. Unless you live in the US, where it's like 3.64 something liters, or something like that. Okay, let's see if this just randomly happens to still work. I was surprised, I think it's like 250 liters a day people use. It seems so much to me. But I guess it makes sense. Just intuitively, had you asked me how much water do people use a day, I would have said like 10 liters. But obviously that's completely wrong. But that's just the gut instinct, you know. You haven't taken a shower? Yes. That's a good thing no one's handwashing. Dude, for the longest time Zeyna insisted on handwashing. She thought it was fine to do that. Can you believe it? You should know you're using your 10 gallons by waiting for the water to get hot. Almost 5 gallons per minute? That doesn't sound right. Does a shower really use that much water? Crazy if so. Does handwashing clothes use as much water per day than Mario? No, because Luigi doesn't shower. That's why Mario says, hey stinky! Oh my god, I used to live in an apartment with terrible water pressure. It sucked. You think people are going to look into datamine, the Warp IDs, and deduce what I consider which course number from that? Would they be crazy enough to do that? Are those daisy singing sound effects final? They are intended to be final, but if there is a better idea, I am open to changing that. I mean, GTA 6 before RTY seems very reasonable, no? GTA 5 came out long before RTY was even conceptualized. GTA 5 came out when I just finished high school. Or before I finished high school, even. I think the R score says. Nope. Is it the U? Nope. Is this here? Yeah. Fuck. 68? Oh, isn't it? It's pointed all the way out. Obviously. 8 is getting delayed again, what does that mean? You can run GTA V on a potato? We might have very different ideas what a potato is. Okay guys, why do you guys care about GTA 6? Literally every Rockstar game I've played was fucking awful. Just recently I've tried San Andreas, like seriously playing it for the first time, and it sucked balls. I don't remember GTA V being particularly good either, I didn't even finish the game. I played Bully the most, and Bully was an awful game. Who cares about GTA? Like... What is this trash? A free C4. Isn't it Mario of the World? Hmm. You can do that before coming home, get real. You know, okay, you're actually right, but the reasoning, the way you got to the conclusion is wrong. Because you play GTA, and all you do is drive. You just drive to a mission, and then the mission is drive to this other place. Okay, your work from home to the console you play GTA 6 on is literally the same as playing GTA 6. So yes, you can do that before coming home, and you need to get real. I see, I didn't parent it to the aerial. Easy fix. Oh, I see, I already read that. I'm also agreeing with a similar sentiment from you as well, like, imagine playing Minecraft. Bro, you can just install Blender and make whatever you want. Build a fake house in your Minecraft world that no one cares to look at, unless they really really like you. Showing someone your Minecraft world is kinda like telling someone else about your dreams. Like, about any dream you have. It's like, unless they're your spouse, or a very close friend, no one gives a fuck. And I bet it's the same for Minecraft worlds. There, settled. The other day, that argued you physically couldn't cheat at Minecraft because there's no objective. Physically can't cheat at Minecraft because there's no objective. Okay. I suppose we need to define what cheating means first, before we can answer the question. And what Minecraft means. Does Minecraft just mean singleplayer? Minecraft means you boot up the game in singleplayer, and do whatever you want in your survival world? Then you never tell anyone about what you did? I mean, I guess cheating apparently means deceiving someone. So, if you cheated a video game, and you never tell anyone you even played the video game, you didn't really cheat. Okay. If you cheat by getting information that's playing creative, if you cheat by modifying the files, did you just modded Minecraft? Yeah. But that only works because these categories already exist. If you played creative, and then told someone you played survival, that would be cheating. It's like saying you can't cheat in Toilet Sister Mario 64. It's not cheating, that's lying. What's cheating if not lying? Cheating must be interesting. I guess cheating might be one specific kind of lie, where you get an advantage at a game unfairly. Or you get an advantage at a game, and then say you didn't. Which... No, wait. Okay, cheating is you get an advantage at a game that's not built into the game. But people have built these advantages into the game, and you can just say I work with these advantages to make whatever you want. So, I guess you can't cheat, you can only lie. If you wanna use those semantics. But I suppose the reason you can't cheat, then, is not because it's impossible to cheat in the game the way it's built. But rather because playing cheated has a name. Right? Let's say you could play modded Mario Kart Wii Online. And that just means you're using cheats to get all the items you want. Now, are you cheating by just hopping into a lobby and doing that? I mean, yes. But I guess under the same logic you could argue I'm not cheating, I'm playing modded. And maybe if there's other people in the lobby that are also playing modded, it's fine. But like... Everyone who thinks you aren't playing modded... Everyone who thinks you aren't playing modded when you're playing modded is gonna be like, oh wait, you cheated. Add on nothing. That is why I said all custom aren't as important as any of it. We're working on a 100% custom code, but I'm not quite done yet. See, I was going through all my files one by one. So... I let... Well, we didn't do all of audio, but... Someone will look at this. We did all the buffer stuff. We did all the engine stuff here, this part. We didn't do these three actors yet, because they're probably going to be completely remade. This is all new, this is all new, this is all new, up until HUD.c. HUD.c is mostly new. So... I guess mostly Mario's actions are left. A little bit of the HUD is left. Interactions is left. The memory is also mostly custom. Object samples are mostly custom, paintings is gone. Farm move is 100% custom. So there is a little bit left to do. Sound in it exists, interesting. IceBeach.ink.c should exist here. IceCastle should be an engine. KoopaRoo should be an engine. OilRig should be an engine. Oil should be an engine. Wait, all of these should be an engine. Oh wait, this is engine! What the fuck. Water.c is... Yeah, okay. I'd say maybe 25% of the way is left. Cheating in Minecraft Survival? Not Minecraft Survival. Okay, well then it's not possible to cheat at anything as soon as you make up a name for the thing. As soon as you make up a name for your cheats, you cannot cheat at anything anymore. Babe, I didn't cheat on you. We just have an open relationship and I forgot to tell you. I just lied about this not being an open relationship. I didn't cheat. I didn't cheat. The liquidation here is pretty rough, actually. If someone completely fucked this up. Cool. Oh, what the fuck. Oh, what the fuck. Oh, that's actually one important relic that was missing. Okay. Hehehe. Okay. That's how it makes cheating cheating is the deception. Like, nobody would argue that he's cheating because he's still lying about what he's doing. Yes. That's how you're saying as soon as there's an accepted name for what you're doing, it is no longer cheating. I'm sure when Minecraft modded first started being a thing, people were like, you're cheating at Minecraft. But because now it is known that modding exists, no one's saying you're cheating. Okay. He's obviously playing with me again. I would argue it's still cheating even though everyone knows. Hmm. Okay, but what if you make up a name for this now? You call this real gun laser tag. Or you just call it real gun tag. And like, now you're playing that. No one's saying, oh, you're cheating at laser tag. They're like, oh, you're playing with a real gun. It's retarded. I can't say that word. It's stupid. But. I'm going to say agree, otherwise it's cheating. Yes, exactly. And if you're playing alone, you are everyone. Hmm. It is a name, it's a crime. Hmm. They don't have set home. Hmm. So you can cheat. Cheat. Yeah, cheating is as soon as you don't abide by the rules people agree to. I guess that's the best way to put it. And I guess people implicitly assume that if you play a game, you are abiding by the rule of your inputting in the intended methods. You don't need to settle. Hmm. Cheating is done with an objective, not at Minecraft the game. Hmm. Hmm. So can you cheat at Mario 64 by using GameShark codes to get all the stars? Does that count as cheating? What if you did that so you have all the stars so you can access everything to practice a speedrun and then you play the speedrun? Didn't really cheat that. Speed driving did. I don't think this is going anywhere. Oh, what the fuck? I was in the completely wrong position. That's why. What if some mechs can be playing within certain world slash restrictions? Hmm. I think the complicated part of this question is to... Okay, let me think about this. Let me analyze this question for a second. Can you cheat at Minecraft? Cheating means to not play by the agreed upon rules. At Minecraft, there aren't really any rules that you need to follow. Because you can mod the game and that's just accepted. Okay, what if you mod Minecraft to just be Super Mario Bros.? And now you play Super Mario Bros. in Minecraft. And I mean, that's not cheating in Minecraft because it doesn't fucking matter, right? It doesn't even matter, right? I guess because every tool is allowed. Like, obviously there's no cheating. Yeah, that's like... Can you cheat at a Gladiator fight? Not really, right? Because no matter what you do, it's allowed. Okay. Can you swap into a Rubick on stream? I don't play Mario 64, Hex. Because Mario 64's physics suck and I cannot deal with it. You can't cheat while playing Minecraft? Because otherwise I'm violated by those rules? Sounds ridiculous. Okay. What the fuck? Oh, oooooh. Obviously we need to add Overwhelm, why? Why was it like this in the code? Holy shit. Are they stupid in 2021? 2020? Do you think it'll be beneficial if you get them afterwards? I don't think so. I don't think so. Because we had rules and we only went to the death? Hmm. Okay, what if there was a spawn that's literally just a fight to the death with no rules? You're allowed to do whatever, you're allowed to bring whatever. Could you cheat at that? No. Because you're allowed to do everything. That's what Minecraft is. Instead of a fight to the death, it's a... There's no rule. But there's also no rules. Hello, Paleros. I need to disable the fog on this, but then I think we're done here. I'm thinking maybe this needs a gate that can open. So that you can't just swim down. Can you cheat on Roblox? But wait, can't you cheat on Roblox? No. I don't know enough about Roblox to tell whether you can cheat at it or not. Viewing games within Roblox, but not Roblox itself. Roblox The Launcher? That's like, can you cheat at Steam? Actually, I guess you can cheat at Steam by downloading games or something, but come on. Seems like a silly thing to say. Can you cheat at making a game? At making a video game? There's a goal here. It's to make a game. Can you cheat at it? No. There are no rules in making games? Exactly. Yeah, yes, that's legal. Is it? Wait, is breaking the rules and doing something illegal equivalent? I think not. Dude, there have to be sports that allow you to do something illegal, right? There have to be sports where explicitly in the rules it is allowed to do something that is actually illegal. Steam bans it, then it's cheating. No, that seems arbitrary. Illegal stealing assets? Okay, so can you cheat at Minecraft by illegally modeling in stolen assets? Hello, Mr. Cereal. Okay, I think we're done with the caves. So the caves are fine. I don't like this part, though, where you just walk. This seems extremely, extremely boring. Okay, Zainab, let's take a look at the Yoshi bots. Yoshi bots. What the song is? Okay. There was going to be an official AmazingJusticeGames game made, would you join him? If I'm being paid for it, sure. I feel like I could make a good game for them. Duncommon should work for them before, even. I say them, I mean the two guys working in SMG4. Why is primitive color used? What the fuck? Is this a Fast64 preset? Because Biobank does this too sometimes. Okay. It's very hard to get the roof right. Something weird is going on here. Oh, what the hell? Why is the texture so big? Why? It's a nice UV map, though. Why is it so big and why is it divvied like this? I think this needs to move up a little bit so it doesn't look weird. They look pretty nice, though. I like them. Just a few technical issues here. Oh my god! God! I click on one thing... Do you see this? I click on this and I move down. I click on this and I move down. I click on... Okay, wait. I click on this and I move down. What? That's not what it was doing before. Before that, it was switching to a different thing. What the fuck? That's fine, just send me the normal textures and I will fix them. I didn't get mad at you, I got mad at Fast64. These look great, though. Why is the file doing this? Why am I getting an epilepsy? I'm checking Blender for 3D printing. Does anyone know how to spread a texture evenly on a mesh when the mesh angles are unequally big? Press U twice. Oh, Zaina, I thought you wanted to do the thing I asked you to do here. With the egg colors, but I guess not. So these are indexed to 16 colors. No vertex colors? Environment color? No, thank you. Environment color? No, thank you. Texture 0 alpha? What is this? It didn't do the alpha thing, I think. Yeah, it's just yellow. Or green. I thought we wanted to use the alpha trick here to get different colored HUDs. Yeah, the dithering is really bad. Bro, I'm going to die. I'm going to die looking at this. What is going on? What are you trying to do? It's not what you did. Do you have this texture with the alpha layer? Because there is no alpha layer here. It's just green. What is this? HUD Roof 101. It's just grayscale, it's not downscaled. If you go down in programming, don't let me just down to earth and chill and a YouTuber. True. Down to earth, that's interesting. I never think about whether I'm down to earth or not, I just do my work. I just try to be efficient. Okay, we can work with this. That looks much better. Okay. That's a nice color. Why can I not see the things above with this view? I think having a slightly less centered outside is going to look super good, like so. Maybe slightly yellowish. I can't make a model out of NERPs. I'm so in my 90s with the actual CGI look. I remember that. CGIgodeffy is down to earth, so no one has been more down to earth. I can't do a good Trump impression, unfortunately. Otherwise I would. I can't do a good Trump impression, unfortunately. Otherwise I would. Zeyna, this is the opposite of what I need. The egg part needs to be transparent, but only semi-transparent, not 100% transparent. It needs to be the other way around. Is this mirrored? Why is it different? Zeyna, can I have this not mirrored? It's also mirrored. It's also mirrored. The dithering looks ass. I have the worst Trump impression, and believe me, it is the worst. How's that? I've met many folks, and they all said this is the worst Trump impression I've ever seen. I've met many folks, and they all said this is the worst. Yeah, sorry guys, I cheated at doing Trump impressions. Yeah, sorry guys, I cheated at doing Trump impressions. Yeah, sorry guys, I cheated at doing Trump impressions. It was the real one. Sounded like a British Trump? Sounded like a British Trump? Oh no. I hope I don't sound British. It's fine. Let me think about a combiner. Actually, I have an idea. So we can use verdex colors to shade the egg and then shade alpha to get shadows in. The prot needs to be somewhat transparent and the BG needs to be solid. Yes. So then you have him where he says he's been talking to a fisherman about electric boats and he says he asked him what if the boat breaks and things and the battery falls in the ocean and also there's a shock coming at you. Honestly, fair point. If that happens, your electric boat would suck to have. Then I also need the original of these here because they look like ass right now with the dithering. This is bad. I think I can improve the color on this here. What did you need? The unskilled version of the middle part. Because this looks horrendous. Look at that. Look at the dithering here. Come on. Nice. Cool. So we have the submarine working. How do we fix this part? We kind of need it to be super long to work here. But do you have a favorite new level from all the 15 you've made? Oh. That's a tough question. And I feel like none really stand out to me. Hello, cold derrot. Yoshi was real? Beefy. Yoshi beefy. Do you know Beefy? I don't. What if we had something that would make you move very fast? No, not Beefy. Beefy! Beefy. It's like a little sausage. With the skin you have to pull off. And this is their mascot. I swear this wasn't their mascot when I was a kid and ate those. But this is their mascot now. I don't stand with this mascot, but it exists. But this is tasty. If Nintendo suit me, talk to a lawyer first of all. And then maybe start a fundraiser for a legal defense. Or just fucking vote. We'll cross that bridge when we get there. Hmm. It's kinda impossible to realign the overworld in a way where this is a shorter path. Now what we could do... Is a little bit of non-Euclidean space. We could just say, you know what? You walk from here to here. I think that is preferable over this. Will players notice? I don't think so. Do you think players would notice if this was non-Euclidean space and you just instantly ended up here without this entire long tunnel? I don't think so. No penguins as usual, I see. No penguins are dummies, I believe. It's the Nintendo 64, you don't really get loading times. In fact, Mario 64 loads so fast, that you can't even see it. In fact, Mario 64 loads so fast, that the developers added fake loading times that wouldn't be as jarring. Did I do it right? I did. I did. Is there anything for the hats? Let me see. Did he send me the unscaled version of this? What size is this? This feels kinda wrong, but let's look at it. One second. It might be right, I'm just generating this code. Okay. What the fuck? No, this is not correct, this looks weird. That's a bad tactile. Is there even an alpha channel here? There's an alpha channel in this tactile. What did he send me? Origami King was amazing? True. I just wish Origami King didn't have any fights. That's... That's exactly what we're doing, Sonny. Don't worry, I'm not asking for help on technical implementation. I think I know what I'm doing. I think I know what I'm doing. Hey, that's better. Yay. The colors are slightly off here. Shit. Maybe I just take the roof corner and make it grayscale, that's fine. That might be the wrong one. That's even wronger. So, you know, the colors don't match. Okay. Yes, that's certainly correct. Okay. I don't think I picked the wrong middle piece. If I did, that would be dithering here. Are the relics on the throne? No. Okay. I have to move that to follow. Okay. Yep. I think this makes the intention very clear on what this is. The non-Euclidean space tunnel. Okay. Okay. Let's see how that works out. I like Super Paper Mario. Super Paper Mario might be my favorite Paper Mario. Someone should make a mod of Paper Mario Color Splash that's just the same game, but every fight, the second you start it, you instantly win. In fact, don't even start the fight. Just win the fight. Okay. Just lean over. Although, I used to think there was a 0% chance that Star World would get finished, and I suppose the demo releasing made me think that maybe 0% wasn't an accurate assessment. Maybe more like 15-25% is more accurate. Okay. The way the camera starts here is pretty awful, but actually that doesn't matter, because we're not going to have fobs in the end. Second demo had four levels fewer than the first one. Okay, but my second demo wasn't meant to showcase progress, it was just to be like, oh look, there's a new engine with a new movement. I purposely didn't put the reworked levels in. Wait, the first demo only had three levels! Okay. So someone's in a cave now? Which sub-level? Okay, Zena, these, uh, let's see. These still look like nonsense to me, but let's see. There's no alpha channel! Oh, maybe there is. There's no alpha channel! What are you sending me? Why? Why are you sending me a text without an alpha channel? Am I being trolled? Oh. What the fuck? Wait, what the fu- okay, wait. Huh? What is this? What is this? Wait, are you saying what you did is that- Okay, so the eggs are supposed to be a decal? They're not supposed to be- Okay, that obviously changes everything. I thought the egg was the texture for the HUD. Okay, obviously this works. Oh my god. I thought we changed that. I asked you if you were doing the thing with the semi-transparency, and you said yes. Obviously this is fine then. Okay. Is your identity just a decal? Huh? Okay, well, this looks pretty terrible now. Well, it wasn't set to decal, so... Wait, it wasn't- No, that was the whole texture here. Okay, well. Why does this look terrible? Wait, it actually just shouldn't be looking like that, though. Okay. Couldn't this be the same HUD as the other one, then? Like... Like so? Okay. Oh, so the HTC One is fine, and then this is? We can change the colors, too. Okay. Hmm. I'm honestly not sure why this looks so ass here. There has to be a weird quantization going on. LIC. Just what does this box look like? Okay, well, I guess we can make work of that. It's still the colors on the top that's wrong here, right? So that definitely still needs to be fixed. Or I could just say, fuck it, and you remap the middle part here onto these two. Let's see if I can do that. Okay. I mean, it looks about the same. I don't think this is awful at all. Shall we just do that? Makes my life easier. Oops. Okay. There's a rare encounter space when you make a romhack. Have to is a strong wording. I like to do that, because I'd like to stick to roughly the same limitations of the time as Nintendo Heart. But I don't have to. I could easily, like, go to a couple gigabytes. But I wanna stay below 64 megabytes. Okay, that looks pretty nice. Okay, but 64 would be cheating. True! How do you get the file size down? Honestly, textures are not a lot of data. Almost all the data is music. And the music is like 80% of the ROM right now. All the levels, everything combined is like 12 megabytes. I think I still have better compression techniques. Alright, I think we have our four hearts. They're pretty nice. 1% code, 19% textures, 80% music. It's more like 3% code, 17% 3D data including textures, and then 80% music, yeah. I actually live in Thailand, it's true. They called me. I live in Thailand where all the other Illuminati live. Alright, I think we actually finished part 6 today. We got it. We got it. We have that. We don't have that. We need that. Oh my god, there's actually a huge thing we need to do here that I forgot about. I don't know yet the game. I'd say 90%. I used to think we were at like 95%, but then Vileback offered to basically remake all the maps. And then we also made a giant overworld. We sculpt-creeped ourselves a little bit away from completion. But it's fine. Or maybe not sculpt-creeped, but polish-creeped. And we have all 15 courses done. And we have around half the overworld done. And we have most of the side levels done. So there really isn't that much left. Yeah, it's about... well, pure space-wise it's not as big as Sonic Adventure. But, like, running around-wise, easily. And there's definitely a lot more to do than in Sonic Adventure Overworld. Do we want the save block down here? I'm thinking no, actually. Well, we'd have to remove textures here and there all over the game. Release it on Steam. So, I think the initial plan was to have the roots of the Super Happy Tree be here somewhere, initially. With Bowser's Grill. Okay, like, biomechs are more than 20% of level up, considering how much you change the stem. Maybe. I mean, in total work hours, probably. But, in terms of my work, no. Yeah, I still need to think about how much up, actually, the roots of the Super Happy Tree idea. We can think about that now, actually. True, case the plumber. Actually, the funniest thing would be, instead of making him a plumber, I'll make him a brick builder and name him after my dad. Instead of Mario the Plumber, it's like Money the Brick Builder. That would be funny. This butterfly has an issue. Let's see what the issue is. That's true, biomech. So anyway, we have this roots of the Super Happy Tree underground here. And then, you would see them, together with the heart of the island. Like the crystal-shaped egg between the roots. And you would slowly see Bowser drilling towards it after the second Bowser level. Or after 60 stars or something. I think it kinda works. It has that sense of urgency. And also a beating heart in the center of the island would look cool as hell. If your hand is bigger than your head, you have cancer. And I don't have cancer, so my hand cannot be bigger than my head. I think the way we do it is that there's just a huge chasm here, where if you jump in, you die. And then the root part of the island is over there. That sounds like a good way of doing it. If your face is bigger than your head, you're actually normal. True. So anyway, this is the end of the level. I hope you enjoyed it. And I'll see you in the next video. Bye! And I think that path short kinda removed some of the feeling that you're deep inside the island here. But at the same time, that path sucked so much that it needed to be gone. That's unfortunate. Thanks for watching! Can you speed up how long? There is. But... Eh. It's like those chili flakes, but just putting them randomly on the ground. I don't know. That's what I want either. Not chili flakes, but chili pepper. I just remembered how in Calcric's game, whenever... I don't know if you guys remember that. Maybe you've seen my playthrough of... What's it called? The game of Sunya. With the cringy edgy guy. I forgot the name. I need the name now, sorry. Hedge Maker's Workshop. He had a power-up that made Mario go faster. Whenever you collected it, the game lagged for 8 frames or so. And I talked to him about it. And I thought it was a bug. But he said it was intentional. It was supposed to give it an impact. And I thought this was like the game loading the running animation or something like that. But nope. It was 100% intentional. Fun fact. For all the fans of... Hedge Maker's Workshop out there. That's the name. When you hit an enemy and the game freezes, that's terrible. When you hit an enemy and maybe your player freezes? Or something like that? Understandable. And for all the fans of... Hedge Maker's Workshop. For all the fans of... Hedge Maker's Workshop. For all the fans of... Hedge Maker's Workshop. For all the fans of... Hedge Maker's Workshop. For all the fans of...

Hedge Maker's Workshop. For all the fans of... I have a big placard too, I have one placard that's like... This size maybe. Alright, next steps. Import the huts that Zeyna made. I think these are ready for import. I'll just put them around here for now. These are all fast64 bugs, nothing for us to worry about right now. These are all fast64 bugs, nothing for us to worry about right now. And... Do the roots of the super happy tree. And then after these are done, we can start doing the villages. Alright, well, I think that's all we'll do for today. There is a very good chance I'll be streaming on Tuesday. So I will be seeing you guys probably next Tuesday. And we'll do the huts or the roots, I'm not sure yet.
