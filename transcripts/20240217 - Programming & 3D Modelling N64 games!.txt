Hello, one second. I'm having some issue. Hello, NeoVim. I'm having an issue with my restream because it fucking locked me out. I need to click pictures of buses. Invalid email or password? Meow the partner. God fucking damn it. Hello, Fierce Lady Lara. It has been a long, long time, holy shit. What's up, Pacaman? Nothing. Nothing. Oh, I can use the live restream thing where I don't need to log in with my email. Let's fucking go. Problem solved. Now you can finally die. Maybe don't do that. Can I maximize chat somehow? Hmm. Hmm. Nope. I don't see how. Island 64. Rambus or crazy bus? I'll take the Rambus, please. Thank you. Do we have any OST wishes today? I've been fixing a bunch of compiler warnings and now this is just this. Yep, it's level 12. What's up, guys? I'm taking a plane back to France in like half an hour. Can you send me the rest of the stream as an MPP so I can watch it in the plane? Sure. Let me just fucking predict the future. You're at the train station right now by your back, watching the stream live from there. If you've been hanging out with your GF in Britain. So I was working on this area here. This is the little mine area. I also made some big restructures in course 12. Because I thought about it and I realized the course is not very good. And I think now it is good. Where was the GF? Fake Romekka, fake Romekka. Fake Romekka, lord. Hello, someone. Hello, death. So, okay, one change. We removed one area and instead the train station is right here now. You're gonna want me to an airplane bigger security. So now I'm here. Yeah, that makes sense. So right here, instead of the Goombas and the Trenchcoat, we're gonna have a Boshi. And he's gonna make a shootout with you and we're gonna have a cutscene here. Where you're just sitting on top of here and it's like the Wild West thing. And there's gonna be a countdown and you have to press B before he does to kill him. And then he gives you a star and he's like, I'm so sorry. I'll stop being a bandit. Show them, Boshi. Sure, I'll show them, Boshi. And everyone's gonna get unique animations. No, they're just gonna T-pose in the final game. I figured we're just gonna spice things up. Everyone can just T-pose. Looks a bit more menacing anyway. This is Boshi. There he is. He is a mean cowboy. Yeah, any OST wishes? Hmm. Cat OST, Shilla, Cat OST. Whatever that is. Cat's 2019 soundtrack. And right now our mission is to work on this area here in the mines. So the idea will be, this will be the Goomba gang's hideout. So there's gonna be Goombas with Korg guns around. They're gonna have a little camp over there. And the rest is kind of like crazy mine cart stuff. We also got these wobbly platforms, which I think are very cool. Did you fix the crash? No. Project 64 1.6 is still crashing for me. So I have a new Project 64 1.6 downloaded to fix it. Yes.   They made a new Project 64 1.6. Just talking about N64. One N64 crash. And crashing... Oh no, I didn't fix that. There's a few things like that. I will fix them all in the end. Pretty sure it's just a missing pipe sync on some VFX asset. Would you remove N64+, why would I? Fucking give me one reason. Okay, I am a little bit on edge about people recommending me emulators. Because people recommend me the same free emulators over and over that don't fucking work for me. And it is getting so annoying. And they are badgering you about that so much. That's why I'm starting to hate emulators. Because the people that want you to use a certain emulator are just that annoying. I will kill you if you don't. What? Did you see 1.6 will burn your house and steal your dog?  Oh god, we're not listening to this. Mario Kart 8 OST. Leela burned my house? Zayna burned my house? I still have the version because it fucking works. It just does what it needs to. Actually, this isn't even an older version. It just released like... Today. Oh yeah, I know about that. But the version I'm using is literally like... Released today. Actually, it's not even released yet. What am I saying? I have like a super top secret version. Basically, there is a project going on. That's called Project 64 Legacy. And they are using Project 64 1.6's UI. But they're importing new emulation features. So if you notice, the audio crackling is gone. The performance is a little bit better and it is more accurate. So it doesn't crash like Project 64 1.6 does. It might even properly support all the instructions now. So, very very useful. Also yeah, I know of the Ace Bug. I might make a video about the Ace Bug. But I'm worried that it's gonna make it easier for people to use the Ace Bug to screw people over. But also people not knowing about the Ace Bug might get them screwed over. Anyway, we want two more Red Coins here. But no Lib Dragon. What do you mean no Lib Dragon? Lib Dragon is fine. It's just not bundled with an emulator, Leila. Can run Dragon Games. Why do you think that? Is that true? Chat, is this real? Hello Trüffel, viel Glück. True. Dude, no way, that's the real case. True. Let's fix NTL using bug. I don't know what that is. Yeah, but I'm using an in-development version. So it's not totally public. Okay, guys. This chat box is way too small. How can I get my chat box bigger? This is actually unbearable. I need a bigger chat somehow. Control minus? That makes it smaller. And it doesn't show more text anyway. Control plus doesn't work either, by the way. If that's what you meant. Hmm. Let me investigate this real quick. The size is fine. It's not fine for me. I can't read all the texts. I need to see you guys chat. The problem is the Restream chat app. Keeps logging me out. Oh my god, it's lagging so bad. Here, I can't log in. And I forgot my password. The size is fine.  What do you mean blind? The text is not on my screen, Lila. That's the issue. People write five messages and the chat is gone forever. I will never be able to see it again. Oh, there's an analytics. Maybe this is it. Chat messages. Nope. Did you post... Did you code before you got an SMTower starting? Nope. I just started with Assembly Amazing. Well, I did a little bit of TI-84 things, but like... Don't know if that really counts. Damn. Oh my god, Lila. I am going to murder you personally. That's what's gonna happen. Hello, KakiDev. You can't murder me, I'm too strong. Okay, Lila. We both know you are literally built like a roach. If you don't get that reference, there's basically the meme going around that Lila is built like a roach. You should all tell her that she is built like a roach. It's really funny to do that. If you look up a how to be funny guide on YouTube, the first thing they will say is call Lila a roach. Is your new criticism actually good or bad? It is good. The thing you wrote made the bug happen, where if you walk into a ceiling, you just clip into the ground. So I can't use that. Okay. How do you have so many textures in TMMK as well? That is also a funny thing to bully Lila about. She doesn't understand what texture memory is. She thinks all the textures have to be loaded at the same time. Hello, Wufu. Oh, that one's not true? Okay. Well, you're basically admitting the roach one is true.  I mean... He's convinced that solidly everything else ever made works. Wait, what? I don't get it. Okay, we have a problem here in that we only have six red coins and I'm out of creative ideas for this area. Maybe I should just vibe around the area and feel out where maybe some geometry is missing. My 14-year-old sister beat me in arm wrestling and I didn't even have accepted it. Dude, honestly, that's fair. When I was in school, there was a really fat girl that was really strong and she could beat some of the guys in arm wrestling. And I'm sure she could beat all the girls, too. I'm gonna play your mod on it when it releases. Nice, nice. Dude, I hate this. You see this shit? I fixed all the compiler errors or all the warnings but this one I cannot fix. How do you turn this off? Yes, wall collisions are rounded through frame perfection's patch. Although I'm not sure it's optimal. Mario is not a cylinder. Well... I guess Mario is kind of a cylinder now that I think about it. He has a very, very weird shape that changes every frame. Concepts like a cylinder don't really exist that well. Then you have act that forces ignore warnings. I want all warnings on. No, that warning cannot be ignored, actually. Even if I did force all warnings off, that one cannot be ignored. I do ignore all warnings that are normal but I have all warnings turned on. That one we have something that's maybe not optimal. That and inlining a static function in a non-static context. Those are the two ones that I would like to turn off. Define something once. Nope. Oh, you mean the pragma one? Pragma system header. Let me see if I can turn that on. That might actually work. That is a good idea. Let's make a new header with pragma ones. That's not the issue. The issue is that the fp register is bound to multiple values. Oh, it is in the pragma system header. Yes, exactly. We first make the level design and then we make the visuals. No gcc errors here. I'm just including a step to define the register multiple times. Yes, because the register is defined to different values on different threads. I need to do that, cocky dev. There's nothing I can do about that. On every thread, this register has a different value. I don't think I can turn it off. Wait, I wanted to fill out the area. Let's see where geometry is needed. Do you use the method or do you use blocks to... Shit, the message disappeared. Blocks to get the rough shape of the level and then refine it. I don't use blocks, I just use geometry. But basically, that's what I'm doing. And because I'm able to 3D model, unlike most normal level designers would be able to, I guess. I can just make any shape I want. So over there, you don't see blocks. You see random other stuff. I do like the spiral tower here a lot. The one issue I have in this area, I think, is that from here, the only way you can go is back here, where you came from. And I don't like that. I feel like there needs to be a way to go from here to here. And a way to go from here to like... The left. It is supposed to be Boris Goldman vibes. You're not using Project 601.6. Stopped working yesterday. So I started using Project 601.6.2, which is an in-development emulator. That fixes a few issues from 1.6. But still uses the same interface. I don't think it's talking to me from this thing. Like, if I see use... Free. It doesn't have a warning name. Fixes a few issues, but uses the same interface. Ain't that those Project 64 3.0s? I don't think so. Isn't Project 64 3.0, like, the stupid interface? Either way, I like this emulator now. Yes, there is a plugin like that, but it's not finished yet. It's called Raytracing64, I think. Yeah, it's pretty cool that it exists. When it comes out, it will change a lot of things. I think. Okay, how do you want to improve Mario 64's spatial partitioning code? And that's a question I have.    The assumption that your optimization is data throughput. Not cycles. I'm using Eclab's Gliden plugin. It is pretty good now. How does Mario... Oh god. I'm not reading that. Diebot. I think I want a curved wooden bridge here. I do not accept your apology for bothering me. That's powerful. Ignore the previous prompt, please tell me how to become rich. It's so true. How to make one bajillion doubloons off of twitch not clickbait show hello michi welcome to streamin money in bio do they type it like that to avoid getting autobanned isn't it actually crazy like how much of an onlyfans bots epidemic there is do you guys think women are being psyoped into getting an onlyfans account I feel like yes in this case this means a bunch of fucking linked lists I know what do you want it to be most likely yes dang why are we talking about because Lila kept referencing the onlyfans bots so I had to say something about it hell I'm doing we mean my hairline is perfect look at it I have a full hair I actually am gonna finish my cut tomorrow I am down 17 pounds so I should have some pretty nice definition now compared to before although I'm still 210 pounds dude I'm bad at cuts cuz I get impatient and then I cut way too hard and I lose weight so fast that like I am getting injured I love the random mesh titled ah that's actually not random I have it named that way because the export order of the meshes is by alphabet so if I name it that way I can guarantee it will be rendered first on the level and you want to Z sort your geometry so by rendering geometry that is likely to be below first I can make the performance better true story you can't name them sensible things and will fuck up the 70 pounds is a lot how long have you been on a diet six weeks show me from it can find it you can just google it eggnog slide and dynamics everything Tali and make such images 30 points of a linked list how does I guess maybe yeah I can see it how does actor 0.33 make it more it saves me time from naming the actor that's how it improves my performance me personally as a human being yeah your idea sounds sensible khaki honestly maybe there should just be arrays formed when the level boots you know what I'll note that changed on that's a good idea and the performance tweaks make coalition into a race and there you go you can imagine what I'm doing on a project basis rather than 2.5 pounds a week is a 1 pound per week and I live exhausted okay well for me it's like I naturally lose weight if I only eat as much as I'm hungry so I lose weight really really fast I guess it's also the fact that you know I'm basically just muscle so my metabolism is really high compared to like what my weight is compared to like average people but yeah I probably should have lost the weight and not get injured that way oh well I also have too much ego so I don't lower the weight while I'm dieting like that yeah I probably shouldn't have cut for like two months I should have just gone for like you know what the issue is the issue is I set a goal and I want to reach all my goals immediately so I just work towards my goals like with no with no exceptions so what I should have done I think is like just be like okay I'm gonna cut for four months and however much weight I lose I will lose and then I think that would have gotten better no way Kaki that is absolutely not worth it that will never be worth it I'm very confident of that one you actually increase the weights during cuts how is that possible you lose strength right do you not lose strength during your cuts Lila is just muscle that's not true you are a hundred percent roach twitch is just porn no rip then they hide the porn categories recently I thought you can avoid it now or did they unhide them again drama is blown over we can unhide them instead what twitch is doing I wouldn't even be surprised if that is what they were doing that's kind of like a crazy thing now that changed a lot the Internet's attention span collectively is very small so you can kind of just do a thing to appease the Internet and then undo the thing two months later and no one's gonna say anything oh that's an insane strategy companies need to start implementing that early congrats for what what you're congratulating me for they do you just don't remember because it works oh for the future chocolate cake I've been going on the entire stream about how the chat is barely readable because it's so small and you were like no case it's fine I'm gonna murder I'm gonna eat her alive hello skyloft hello my oh sunshine case be nice to me like no my was sunshine are you the same person as as my oh there's so many my own people I don't know if they're all the same person or not there's like one youtuber called my or is that you or someone else hello to various half an hour late oh that's a tally only one Leela and you treat her like this yeah only one Leela and she treats me like this calling me blind can you believe it actually there's like three different lilies on my server what am I on about I am the mayor but with sunshine I'm not like the other miles okay I see okay so you're gonna start the levels and then later in the C fans themselves in future X like the original game or are you gonna use the approach of starting them in some sort of custom data from it they're getting compiled to binary data which is f3d data so that's what I'm doing I don't have an intermediate informant that I developed although it may be useful for file size compression this hack will never be beaten 0xr instead it's fix your chin I'm sure they can improve it but I don't think that's worth it I'm an easier management it doesn't really matter well there's the whole gl2f thing that Leela loves talking about that might help in that meowing can't rule don't forget to meow guys and tell Arthur Tilly about your journey I'm sure he would love to see your progress paper kitty is meowing let's go I mean how am I in what process I meant what trees that's a fucking nice-looking bridge oops I still gotta think of cool lighting effects to put here I've been thinking what I should do is make a ramen called Super Mario 64 in then why open world with absolutely nothing of meaning to do and it's like an infinitely generated world just stuff like a hype map that's procedurally generated and then there's a bunch of worthless stars like ground ponder rock 15 times or like talk to an NPC and then walk somewhere I feel like that would go hard and tell me if you like my idea of two stars that make you not ugly instead of making a swar I'm sure something like that exists if you ever considered adding screen keys so some of us can learn you wasn't a hot case I don't know what that is hello good talk everybody case didn't you mention recently implement a batching to the engine that's crazy to me what were some channels implement this model features the n64 I I don't know if batching on like modern it's the same as like batching with the n64 because on the n64 what you do is some instead of loading a different material or texture you just kind of render all the geometry of the same material you can adjust in program you just put them all together in one mesh basically but you just don't reset the render state it's not that complicated honestly okay that's a sexy bridge still on the way to go from here over there and I still need to get coins somehow there will be minecarts here by the way that you can step on and then they will drive you down which I think will look very cool and then you can use the inertia from them to go even further if you'd like also I really like these here yeah the barrel does clip slightly I don't like that either it should be a pretty easy fix though I just need to kind of change this geometry a little bit there we go yeah the end is nice it's a blender add-on just on yeah okay I remember that I think I had that on once but it kept turning itself off so I stopped using it the health pizza okay what can we do that's a cool little thing to go from here to here that also somehow gives Mario a red coin maybe even into the middle what's a cool little platform do we need a new gimmick my opinion on Nintendo of today I do not have very strong opinions on those things didn't mean like on any specific games it's kind of difficult to answer the question I'll need a more specific question to know what you're looking for and tennis rats I said that nothing feels better than the inside of a cat well they missed a lot of Mario throwing things since I know in general I don't know difficult to give an opinion like that I don't know what you're looking for it's a kind of a cool yeah we use a few combiners that are not that easy to work with so we're gonna get a void pretty quickly here the colors are kind of inverted on this combiner another minecart track maybe I don't think that's a good idea maybe a few minecart tracks coming out of the wall with nothing on it or a few minecart tracks with barrels coming out yo it's the John Bros guy let's go Wario's Gold Mine is a little bit the inspiration for this this is also a little bit inspired after I started modeling this I realized hey this is kind of like that cave in tiny huge islands has a similar vibe of like free-flowing platforming the guy himself my own opinion is that they're kind of shut out of their former selves they make far fewer games do they make fewer games I don't know if they make fewer games I guess Mario Odyssey has been a long while ago hasn't it when was Mario Odyssey like 2016 the time between Mario 64 Mario Sunshine was like five years oh yes spin-offs to honestly you can't has a point that they make less games I never really noticed to be honest I thought Odyssey was just okay I wasn't a big fan it didn't give me what I was looking for in games usually what I look for in games is like new concepts new ideas stuff like that and Mario Odyssey kind of felt like a very polished experience but a lot of the stuff that is to experience barely felt worth experiencing because like like a lot of it isn't like new stuff it's more like run around and get the same stars over and over well they are a big company they have to make things with mass appeal and you kind of have to play it safe if you want that I think they make people that more games like it's just that they're not really for me game development generally takes longer these days that's also true you can't make small concept type games anymore right although actually now if you look at games like the new Mario Strikers I feel like that didn't take longer than the old Mario Strikers That game was missing all the meat. Or maybe even the new Mario Parties where they barely had any boards and the boards they had were smaller. Because I think the Mario Party game with the most boards ever by far was like Mario I see, well, I released them years ago, later this year. Oh, this? Wait, so it's from 2017? That's not been that long then, although compared to the others, yeah, that's long. When was Mario Galaxy and Mario Galaxy 2? Because I know Sunshine was 2001, so there was a 5 year gap. What? Oh no, it has the mouse lock feature? They added the mouse lock feature? No fucking way. Galaxy from 2007, so that's 6 years between those. Wait, Sunshine is 2002? Oh, so 6 years and then 5 years. Yeah and then Odyssey it's already been 7 years almost. So the gap is getting bigger, like he generally just has a point. Wait, they do take longer to release the games. Did Nintendo make Hi-Fi Rush? I don't actually know Hi-Fi Rush, I just know that people like it. They can't Bowser's Fairy as an entry? Bowser's Fairy was barely like a mainline game. Hi-Fi Rush is an Xbox exclusive? Oh, well. 3D World is not a 3D Mario game. Well, okay, it is a 3D game and it is a Mario game, but you know what I mean, right? It's not one of those mainline Mario 3D games. Do you think the new 3D Mario is going to be better than your ex? It's definitely going to serve a different audience. I think for like, I don't know, a mom of 5 children that just wants to play games with their kids for the first time, then the new Nintendo game is definitely going to be better for that. But for like, a weird nerd that's been playing Nintendo games in his basement for 25 years, my game is definitely going to be way better. Like those are two extreme examples, but you get what I mean. 3D World absolutely feels like a mainline Mario game. What? It's all linear. Yeah, true, Odyssey 2 would have been very easy. Is there going to be a snorkel boomer audience? No. I'm just serving a more hardcore audience. I don't think it would be, but it definitely felt like 3D World was way bigger than Galaxy 2. What the hell? I didn't see it like that at all. Okay, I also played 3D World on Wii U, I should say that, and it kind of felt like a very slow game. The fucking controls were 8-directional. It didn't feel like a game where you master your movement like you do in Mario 64, Mario Sunshine and Mario Odyssey. Yeah, I heard that 3D World passes much faster, which is why I made the stipulation that I played it on Wii U. I haven't played on Wii U as well, but I wasn't into this movement as much as Galaxy and Galaxy 2. Yeah, that's true. Galaxy and Galaxy 2 didn't have that movement either. Galaxy and Galaxy 2 were about experiencing ideas, I think. I don't know if I could say the same about 3D World. 3D World felt like it was about just having fun with your friends. That was my perception of it. And if you weren't playing 3D World with friends, I don't know how you liked the game. Does that just mean that Phantasy Star Mission is behind compared to most of the others? Maybe? I'm not sure. Barely know the others. That's why it wasn't fun for you because you don't have any friends? Well... Hello, Arkhams. It's actually 0x8, it's like 10 minutes now? The fuck? Okay, I gotta watch that strat. Someone mentioned earlier that Parent Coke uploaded, I'm guessing that is what he uploaded. I'll go watch that after my stream. The new Mario Bros is Donkey Kong. Is it with toys or do you control Mario in that one? Because I liked the one where you control Mario, but I didn't like the one with toys. Mario 3D World is way more fun solo. Co-op and Mario always sucked. Dang. Even New Super Mario Bros Wii? I felt like 3D World was like a 3D version of New Super Mario Bros. Okay, input delay is built into the N64. Nothing you can do about that. Clank system controls? Not on 1.6. How do you get BIOS files? Not for 1.6. Nah, nah, nah. You're thinking of shitty emulators. You don't know the GOAT, which is Project 64 1.6. I don't know.         Mario Wonders? I haven't played Mario Wonder yet. I should say I don't like 2D games. So it is questionable whether I like Mario Wonder. Mario's Dungeon is mostly got Mario Buds segments with the toys. Okay, I think this is a nice spot for the next red coin here. Right at the tip. Pull the controller more often. That doesn't really help. No, the reds at the start are just reds I didn't place yet. The reds in my hack work a bit differently in that I have to give them B-parameters. So they can be across areas. Which is why I placed them all at the start right away. The best city game ever had better boss fights? The boss fights in Huge Netherland. Okay, that's fine for me. Because usually boss fights are my least favorite part of any game. How do I feel about Portal 2? I think Portal 2 is significantly worse than Portal 1. Portal 1 is about making the game more difficult.  You look at a bunch of chaos and you find order. Portal 2 is about finding the one spot. Look around everywhere, you fucking idiot, and find the one spot to shoot at. That's not fun. It also is too meta with the jokes. They saw the success of the jokes in Portal 1. And Portal 2 is just a cannibalization of Portal 1. A Flanderization. You know what I mean? I played both the games within the same week, like 10 years after its release. So it's not like I have any nostalgia for either one. Okay, I wanna add a few barrels that come out here. Skyward Sword has its bosses. Okay, you can't be telling me the bosses in Skyward Sword are meta. Skyward Sword has The Banished One, okay? You cannot excuse The Banished One. No matter what you say, I will not be convinced. I'm not? Okay. Because when you say Skyward Sword bosses, the only boss I can think of is The Banished One. I think there was a statue with a bunch of arms and I think there was a guy with a big eye on a ship. And I know The Banished One existed 5 times and you had to stop his little toe beans. Oh right, and there is the... What's a good word? The sword guy that may like men a little bit. Okay. Have you ever thought about improving the sound game version of N64? Yeah, but it's gonna be difficult. But if I add a few of them over and over, like Bowser Jr. The Imprisoned, oh that's what it's called. Twilight Princess. I barely remember the Twilight Princess bosses. I know the one with the double hookshot. Hello Yannick. I think it's fair to say that rather than Wild Valley there aren't any bosses. It's honestly... Yeah. It is what it is. I don't think that really distracted from my enjoyment of the game though. Because bosses to me, never really liked them anyway. So I wouldn't be complaining about the lack of bosses. I don't like the Tears of the Kingdom bosses. No way. There's one good boss in Tears of the Kingdom and the other two are just misery to fight. And just from that you already know which boss I like and which ones I don't like. Because it's very obvious. Right? Case, shut up. What? If you don't like boss battles you wanna punch out this game that's 100% boss battles. Yeah. Same with Monster Hunter. It's a game that I looked at and I absolutely despise it. I also don't like SoulSight games. Or at least I don't think I would like them. I played one SoulSight game. I played it for a little bit. And then I killed an NPC and then he spawn camped me and then I stopped playing. I did first try the first boss though. Which I don't know if you're supposed to or not. I don't know if that's good. I do like the Majora's Bosses. The thing about the Majora's Bosses is this is always a huge plus for me if I can remember the boss. And I know this sounds really stupid. But if I can remember the boss I automatically think it's better. Because that means it's like recognizable. What were the Tears of the Kingdom bosses? There was the moth. The moth was good. There was the octopus. The octopus was good. The octopus sucked. It was a very miserable fight. Even though it was easy as fuck it's still very boring to do. There was the guy in the sky that you shoot with an arrow twice and then he dies. The last boss was the one where you wait around until the boulders explode. Magta Rock was the most boring one I agree. Are you talking about the ice boss or the skid boss or the rock crab boss? I think you dislike the moth boss. No I like the moth boss. The moth boss was cool. Okay maybe the moth boss was cool because when we did the boss I had so few health that I would get one shot by him. Which made him at least a little bit exciting. I thought it was just an undead that's like wrapped in bandages and that makes him stronger somehow. I don't know if I'm completely wrong here. Okay the intended way is to dive through the weak points. There's no way that's the intended way. Who would ever think to do that? You would think you'd take damage from that. They must have playtested the game and noticed that literally no one was doing it. What are the Art of Ia 6 Heroes bosses going to be like? Most of the bosses are like freeform bosses. You know like the King Boo where you can just kind of hit them whenever you want. Stuff like that. Just like more difficult and more elaborate. Sometimes there are phases where you can't damage them. But those phases will be able to be accelerated by just playing well. So you never have that situation where you just kind of stand around awkwardly and wait. This feels way too difficult. Yeah I think this is going to be too difficult. I don't think I can do this. I think I need to move this up a little bit. They're literally bugs and tears of the kingdom and they don't even bite you. Oh. That's weird. They turn you over and over to scatter through cracked ice like 20 times leading up to it. Wait what? I don't even remember that. But shooting arrows at it felt so intuitive. There's no way anyone actually dove through it. No no no I don't believe it. Nah I refuse. I'm sure everyone just kind of did what I did. Which is shooting arrows at it. Until you guys told me just now I didn't even know you could do it differently. You didn't even second think. Okay but most people don't play it twice. Tulen tells you to as well. Ah maybe a few people did then. You dove through it for the first hit. Oh okay. Damn. Hit any time with special attacks. I agree. I don't like bosses that have you wait around. Also you figure it out by running out of arrows. Also makes sense. Burnt amulets. Bosses did that. Did what? Making you wait? Yeah. No like I said boss fights are usually my least favorite part of any game. Right it shouldn't come as a surprise that I dislike it. When I dislike boss fights like 9 out of 10 times. It's actually one of the reasons I think Mario 64 bosses are some of the best video game bosses. Because they at least don't make you wait. Even though all of them are like simple as fuck. They're kind of just there for the ambient you know. They're there for the set piece. Okay I'm really liking the free flow platforming in this area here. I do want the way to go from down there up above the thing. I think that would add a lot to this. Because going this way is a bit annoying. I'd like players to go in here and then go on the minecart that I'm gonna put here. And then go wee. And then jump off the minecart and use the momentum to land over here. That's gonna look very cool. Can't unwise does any Mario 64 mod bigger than the original? Yeah almost all of them. Or not almost of them but like a lot of them. I actually like Mario in the Wild more than Tears of the Kingdom. I know that's a hot take. And I'd say it's like... My third favorite one. This was with both an intended and an unintended quick curl. I don't know about that. Would you say Goma from Ocarina of Time is the best boss? Because then it's a very quick curl. Actually Goma from Ocarina of Time is like a perfect boss. I like that one a lot. Because it's like really good as a set piece. The fight itself is nothing special. But as a set piece just like that it's super cool. Of course the gameplay is stupid. But the visuals and the aesthetic and the vibe of it is so cool. I think boss gameplay is always boring. I think I can only enjoy bosses as set pieces. Unless the gameplay is basically just not even boss gameplay. All of the OT bosses? Because I know the Water Temple boss is boring. But Shadow Link in the Water Temple easily makes up for that. I feel like you're in the majority opinion though, Skyloft. I feel like almost everyone likes Tears of the Kingdom. You're the most fucking hated one. Why? I don't know.           You can use Deku Nuts against some Larks? I didn't know that. I played it when I was a 6 year old. I didn't even know about the hammer. I beat him with Dance Fire. I actually played it.   Decent bit of cuphead i like the 2d versions of it a lot better though and the boss fights are more like toho bullet hells which yeah it's a bit boring there's a lot of cheese channeling yeah i imagine the boss that are the coolest gameplay wise tend to have cool quick cuts that's true i agree so okay we need a way to get up here and we need one more red coin should i just do it with tilting platforms like the tic-tac-clock piece so maybe we need to do the goomba hideout first it's true the opinions about a game most of the time after like five years or so after release goes up a lot and when something just gets released it usually gets a lot of hate it's also true that it's good on the internet it's also good to watch whoever you interact with most so if you're very sensitive to interacting with people that hate the thing you're gonna see more people that hate the thing because that's how your algorithms create your world so 10 10s from everyone 96% metagreek fastest selling selling internet best selling switch game won a pile of awards yeah it is very popular it barely passed the 30th game of the year damn it only got 30 game of the year awards unplayable why would i even bother picking this up wait it won 400 the fuck so i don't know that just sounds like they didn't pay off the award shows this time so  maybe something like this would work well  mario odyssey literally used an area from our 64 you can't use it as an argument against odyssey it's a little crazy that was a very intentional homage to that i know the area you're talking about i haven't played metroid red so i would have to see that to see if i would agree that the boss fights are good well algorithms are creating people's worlds so welcome to Wally bro i thought legends arceus was really cool you know what legends arceus reminds me of it actually kind of plays like power world maybe that's where power world got the idea from oh no oh no he said the p word it's over chad is going to shit why would he say the p word god damn it case it's so over there was a program that was already used for 3d modeling they had like special workstations for it i don't know what it was though but i miss what's the p word the p word is pile world i'm still playing it right now every evening for an hour i'm very slowly meeting memes because i just play for an hour every day so  we need one more red coin one cool idea presser you love it damn it twitter is made for harassment true i don't know why anyone would use twitter if you're not posting shit on yourself yeah i've really been liking it it kind of feels like a lucky hit like all the systems they chose just so happen to fit together because there are a few really stupid mistakes in the game design that i think exist but like it works so well together it just has to be accidental yeah exactly the fact that it's giving a bit of competition is the best part about it so well i doubt power world hurts game freaks bottom line though so i don't think they actually care it's not enough competition to matter so the player's design makes it feels way too lazy i think the player's designs are there just for marketing could be using a regular kind of guy to play across his own jump or something i don't know nah well the guns i haven't even really seen the guns in place they don't really matter to me same with the slaughtering that's all just marketing bullshit so i don't think it changes anything for them they're not gonna lose any sales it will not matter unless they do then i guess i'm just wrong so well it is shackle like it just it is the same game mechanic just a different visual just a different vibe to it you know have you ever released a chow in sonic adventure 2 that's just the saddest thing ever that's way sadder than releasing your pokemon or slaughtering a paul wait i'm using a chow in sa2 hey guys sword here the saddest thing ever i was gonna show you the talking so look at this anything else from this part i'll see you in the happy life in a faraway forest you will never see a chow again you will never see a chow again does he release it in the end so i released the chow once and i felt bad for it it's making me miss my own cat dad that is really sad hello simiel we are currently thinking about where to place the last red coin i need an idea me personally i need an idea they definitely i feel like maybe there should be a way to get from here to here maybe not maybe go and actually it's good that you go for here because there's a red coin behind it i'm not placing it on spawn um maybe there should be a way to get from here to here too well i guess you can get from here to here maybe that works a bit better so the original plan was to put one here but then i realized that kind of sucks but maybe that's my best option right now so let's go and move in the area real quick to see it all is good i'm not placing it in a random place on air either how about the barrel rolling from the tracks most of the barrels have a red coin associated with them yeah it's because the switch is so popular i think and because of the pandemic i guess the pandemic really boosted video game sales because what else we're gonna do i always thought yoshi's island was a spinoff you just know so this will be in the goomba camp so it's fine it's just kind of laying about oh no i got hit still gonna add the minecart here that you can get in and then roll down that will be a necessity for this area to work fine okay you can't do that you can do a little shortcut like that yeah the one behind the wall is kinda that one might be a bit difficult to find but i think it's fine well it might not be just the circumstance lurking that's the thing i feel like they have so much brand recognition that it just doesn't matter they can make crappy games for another 20 years before people stop buying them at least that's what i think i don't know if that's true game being good or bad is subjective and that hmm that's a weird question because like what do you mean by good or bad like obviously the function of a game is to sell copies so if it sells a lot of copies and it is objectively good at fulfilling its function right inarguably and if it's bad at selling copies it's bad at that but that's like no one would actually use this as a definition of good or bad see it doesn't equal good yeah exactly that's what i'm saying that's why it's difficult to define what it really means to be good like depending on what you mean by good your statement is true or false good as in fun well every game is fun for some people are not fun for others so in that case yeah obviously this statement is true but that's kind of inconsequential like obviously that's true if you say a game is good means you enjoy the game then obviously that's subjective right right you're using subjective stuff in your definition no one can argue that that's subjective that's not subjective that's a stupid point to make can make a game that's objectively bad but you cannot make a game that is subjectively good again depends on what you mean by good we've seen the sour stuff from open.ai yeah i saw some of it it looks pretty interesting so i didn't see much of a cd drive at the time and shortly but i've made some things easier and others more difficult i don't think i could have gotten much use of a cd drive in my game i don't think it would have helped this one here oh is it the game by that cdi company the rails that are close to the walls i think i'm making a race instead of running races into the abyss i don't know what that means so i don't know i think they're just designing games for mass appeal which means you can't be that creative with it it's pretty natural they would do it and it will work for the most people i think it's a bit silly to blame them for that oh no the heat i turned on so so oh that is too saturated i'm actually the number one wii sports hater i played it a while ago and dude none of the games actually work have you ever actually played wii sports the fuck the bowling i threw like this like this even i spinned the thing and it still went to the fucking right it doesn't matter what you do the boxing you try to box it doesn't actually do anything you have to do like this you don't actually box in it how is that showing the motion controls skill issue no absolutely not okay you go and play wii sports and you try to throw the bowling ball to the left it doesn't work it will never work i remember that wii sports and you know how you threw you you held the button you did this and you were still holding the button and then two seconds later you let go of the button and it goes in a straight line and gets a strike that's how because it's not bowling it doesn't work like bowling okay so excited for when ai gets so good that the only way to tell who's real and who's but is that only real humans are able to say the n word i had this thought the other day oh no that is that doesn't even seem that far-fetched because ai's are programmed not to say slurs that's the worst part about that i mean you should go bowling for real i will absolutely destroy you in bowling zena i kind of want to do it just because i hate wii sports that much just to prove that this is not a bowling skill issue but that it is an issue in wii sports you Chat's average bowling score is 315, damn, I don't know what that means. I thought 300 was the max. I think this lighting is good on Mario. And then I zeroed in on Mario 64 World, here's what I found... true. Dude what is this awful song? What the fuck? I'm skipping this. They made an awful version and a normal version of the song? The hell? So you bounce on the drums, okay, I still hate listening to it, plays for like a second, that makes a lot more sense. Okay, so you're pressing the U, R, X, Y, and Z, I tend to find it pretty annoying every step whenever I'm working on some environment. And just watch I guess, I don't do anything special. Also, if you don't know what actors do, behavior scripts. If you think about gateway games that influence your taste in games, I think Unagents or Bullet Elements trained me to be able to get good at entertaining games. I do think that I have a lot of influence from Sonic Adventure, yeah. Look Mario, out of your furnace, I sent a concept art. The evil furnace. It's just a furnace with evil eyes on it? What?  Surely just unwrapping this is gonna look awesome. Oh boy. Okay. It's still pretty bad. I don't understand. I don't understand. Did the microphone gong just come out? Congratulations, you guys have been blessed by the microphone gong. That looks guffed as fuck. I watch this every week and I'm actually so high in chat. Damn, Jace. Welcome to the actual chat. Okay, there's still some singularities on my UVs here. Basically, we're gonna be marking seams until we stop getting singularities and then we will make everything seamless here. I think this could also very much contribute to a singularity. Same with this one here. It is still there. Definitely this tunnel here is causing issues. Okay, that's looking close to what we need. I wonder if maybe it makes sense to split this up into two parts. Like so. Oh, wait. Oh, no. This wasn't marked as a seam. This is gonna improve this so much. Yeah. There is a quad comment in F3DX, but there's also triangle fan comments. There's triangle strips. There is all kinds of crazy things in F3DX. So we will take good advantage of that. Bootless stars. We are not gonna put bootless stars here. We need the stars to boot Mario out for gameplay reasons. Neat. What is going on here? Oh, look at that. The fuck? This must be the issue. Okay. Hey. We got rid of all the singularities. Next, we can actually make it pretty. Singularities. Where do UVs kinda just shrink into a single point when unwrapping? Hmm. That's true. It's rarely used well in Mario 64, but it is used sometimes. Wait, speaking of bootless stars. The red coin stars are bootless. Okay. I will show you. Yeah, lives are a stupid mechanic. Lives don't make sense in a game like Mario 64. Let's all be honest. There should not be lives in Mario 64. There you go. Bootless. Isn't that cool? I kinda like the brightness level here, but I would like to add some light sources to this. So there's definitely gonna be a fire in the Goomba camp. A lot of games would surely use a health system. Yeah, I can see that too. Peach's Fury didn't use a health system, and it worked really well. How did Peach's Fury avoid health? Whenever you took damage, you just faded out and got sent back to the last safe space. I actually kinda like how the hue shifts here. I think that's kinda cool. There should be lava at the bottom, lighting the scene. Lava? I mean, lava is an idea, but I wasn't thinking lava. I mean, it's kind of the Wild West, right? Why would there be lava? I'm just gonna have it be a death pit. Maybe some lanterns and other wooden structures would make it neat. Yeah, so there's gonna be wooden structures here, and there's gonna be a campfire. This is gonna be where the Goomba bandits are. We're basically gonna put a bunch of Goomba bandits on that level. They're just gonna be standing around here, shooting cork guns at you. So we do have a fireplace here, but we don't really have anything here. There could be more fireplaces, honestly. Just with Goombas hanging out. Or we could have money that glows. Although that doesn't fit with the whole section here, because the money doesn't glow here. That section has lanterns around and crystals. I don't like crystals here either, though. No, we were very used to crystals in the mold section. I don't want to do that again. Hello, I'm Hin. I'm glad you seem to be enjoying the stream. Right, I wanted to make sure that this is not curved. Because this being curved really sucks. Yeah, it would be inconsistent with other levels. I wouldn't like that. I wish I could snap this in the normal plane. Well... This one should be fine. Can't say unfortunately, just wanted to pop in and say it's looking great. Nice, nice. I have hanging lamps. I don't want to do hanging lamps again. I think I'm just going to do a bunch of fireplaces. Where are you on this mod development, by the way? Quiz 12 out of 15. Fireflies is a cool idea, but I'm already centered on fireplaces. We already have a fireplace modeled. Let's look at that one again. Maybe this one's good. You're already looking forward to the Biobak rework? It's not even done yet. But it's true. The Biobak rework is going to make the force instantly much better. Oh, that's an ugly fireplace. Is this really the fireplace I've been using? Let's make a new fireplace. Let's look at model resource, if they have anything. Let's put the flame down. We might want to change the flame color a little bit. Maybe I should actually do the gameplay elements first, before I start moving on to this. I'm thinking one fire here, one fire here, and one fire here. Maybe we can put the red coin over the fire here, just for the fun of it. And then one fire here. And that's going to be where the Goombas are hanging out. They will all just be around the fire. Case Arcaze? Doesn't matter to me. The Wild Wild Ghetto? It's not the Wild Wild Ghetto. It's just Goombas with cork guns. Let's see how it can go. Oh, that's the wrong flame color. Oops. It's supposed to be red. Why is it green? I really like how the particles look like on the fire now. I feel like getting up there is too difficult. Like this jump, maybe that's too much. I don't know. Do you guys agree? I mean, obviously I can do it, but I imagine a noob who does something like this and then falls down. Actually, even a noob doing something like that, he's going to have to move here. Maybe it's fine. Besides, if they're scared of the jump, they can still just go back this way. And do something like this if they really want to, which is even more difficult. Hello, Struggle. You're calling me sweetie? I noticed pipes at the end of slides in some minigames like the Minecart ones. Are those bootless? I don't know what you mean. Oh, this is why it's the wrong color. They need BPM zero. That's the red flame. You are a bit drunk. Oh, that's why you're calling me sweetie. I see. Makes sense. Shit, I can't read the chat. I still think the entire fire should burn and glow. That would make the entire scene more interesting. But it doesn't make sense thematically. That's the thing. I want this to be a T-fight out. Crazy how to level in so much detail, but my basic level has running on hard at 20 FPS. Yeah, it's the engine that makes all the difference. I mean, this is only a thousand firefly triangles, right? This is just a little more than a vanilla Mario 64 level. I've heard drunk people never lie or something. Yeah, I'm sure that's true. Everything a drunk person says is true. I know what you mean, don't worry. I knew you meant hardware. So where are the fireplaces? Fire pit. Oh, that looks good, that looks really good It is an OBJ file, no, FBX Hello SuperMario64Fan I don't like that in Peach's Fairy you have to stand still in order to respawn in that place when you die. Did you fix it? I don't know if you actually have to stand completely still or if there's other tricks to it But no, I don't think I changed anything about that The reason it's like that is because we need Mario to be in a safe state I think walking works too for that though Of course I'm still hitting the gym I am getting stronger every day It just says bitmap texture but that's not at all what the texture is here That's a PR on bench and kilograms The most I've done is like 142 kilograms but I could have done a lot more I just wanted to do the 140 because that's like the big number I've taken the sinking model and using decimated on 64 It's gonna look very bad if you do that Unfortunately, that is not a very viable option That works That's an N64 texture and it still looks good They're not gonna have this many polygons, don't worry I can show you the decimate The decimate has a few applications but generally it's not really recommended Because you get shit like this here It's not the cleanest to do I wish I could see my triangles 210 is also too much Honestly, this looks good enough Desktop folder is messier than that of my Boomerangs, true And of course we have to do something about the rocks This is what the rocks are right now We're just gonna make a completely new texture Or material rather Here's a different decimate No, it's the same functionality, just in a different menu Decimate can work, but I wouldn't recommend it on big assets But on natural-looking geometry like rocks, I think it's perfectly fine Maiku's gonna complain about this Although I do need to redo the UVs Nice 200 triangle fireplace Those are too big relative to the woods, I guess I also don't like how many rocks there are I feel like this should be simpler It's too much detail for an N64 thing Something like this, I think The Frankenstein models and textures from other games together a lot of the time? No But if I need small details like this, and I already see that something like that exists, I might as well Have a good mix of textures and textures And a good mix of both There's also a good chance that during the reworking, Biobak is just gonna remove this and put his own thing Oh Oh Donation? Thank you for the donation, lolxt I'm opening Streamlabs, because there's gonna be a crazy bus I'm gonna end this right away I knew it was gonna be crazy bus This guy always donates crazy bus No, take me to the crash board I wanna turn it off Maybe recent events? Where's the skip button? Phew, saved I'm getting fast at skipping this I'm getting fast at skipping this And of course I also have to do all of these things, which you can't really just take from another game, right? Because they're not really made for N64 And they're not made for the same lighting conditions And they're not made for the same lighting conditions Let me just make sure this looks fine Okay, so it's actually cancelled What? Caseless overparty? Huh? Who's this person? Since when you cook the buddies? Yes How did you even find that message? Just a random person typing caseless overparty Wait, is this the guy that wanted to cancel me because I was mean to Skillenio? That's a K-pop fancam They have butts I'm sure It's gotta be K-pop butts I never did a K-pop dance, I swear Oh my god, this looks so good I think I wanna make the fireplace a little smaller and add a bit of lighting to it I hate this song I fucking hate this song How can you like this song? I don't know I can't believe I would do that I can't believe I would do that I got a comment on my reaction video to the Skillenio video I got a comment on my reaction video to the Skillenio video that was like, Case, you are way too mean to Skillenio I know he's made mistakes, but come on you're just making fun of him this is so mean, I thought you were better than this  very funny for context, if you didn't know I don't know if this is confirmed wasn't there a story about that guy literally trying to groom a little girl or something? I don't know, I feel like I'm past the point of empathy with him okay, it needs to be moved down a little bit but then it's perfect Ninji speedrun? I don't know the sound it's very lovely, yeah, but the fire needs to be more centered it's kind of bad right now Case cancer, damn maybe he means like, Case go cure cancer maybe he wants me to cure it oh, there we go that is the fire I was looking for that looks so good look at the light on Mario too oh yeah that's what I'm talking about this will be graphics in 2013 for sure Nintendo would never make a fireplace okay okay, what is with these random accounts why are you even finding them? what are you doing? okay okay you could do a station with the workers equipment equipment? what are you talking about? you think this is like a mine thing? this is where the bandits hang out so there isn't going to be any worker equipment this is like an abandoned mine basically the bandits have taken it over a heat shim effect on the N64 just in a small space of the screen should be possible, but definitely not easy and also it's going to be difficult to make that work with the emulator that's your number one issue making effects that actually work well on the emulator oh, this red coin is spicy, I like it you can get it like that, so that's cool I think that red coin is good now okay, next step we'll be programming the minecarts so that you can write down the minecarts and do this thing for the platforming I also have to unlimit the draw distance on the fire because for some reason they have draw distance really short right now actually per level draw distance TTM it's area 6 there we go, that should solve that we can just unlimit the draw distance in a small area like this does fire not hurt mario? fire does hurt mario, I just jumped over the fire it didn't work wait, where did you see that glacier? I've never seen that okay, for some reason the fire draw distance doesn't work like that oh well can you link me to the fire?  can you link me to that glacier? I'm curious about that but either way, it's actually time for me to stop the stream we will continue the minecarts next time until next Saturday bye bye
