You hello my microphone is now unmuted who is up and ready for some rum making I'm sitting ah shit there's the wrong microphone audio but can you guys see everything so only two areas are missing in this level and they're gonna be for the last star and the last few Yoshi coins hello Alex Valico remember Yoshi sounds? oh yeah what the fuck was that so this is gonna be one of the last two Yoshi coins just like helping the old man clean what do you want to change about mine what is it liking and then we'll have one Yoshi coin up here you will slide down somewhere and then do a jump to that thing I want to make sure you can't get the coin that is a weird mechanic oh there it looks like it's gonna be possible but that's fine so I'd like to use a vanillium for the barriers and I'm getting stuff be very separate okay that's literally just a cringe opinion is there gonna be a trailer at the Nintendof Endgames Direct? No. hello Biobak thank you for letting me know I never noticed let me explain to you what this area is gonna be real quick so you have an understanding of this and can help me think about how to best make this area work before we start what is our OST for today any wishes any desires what did you think of the new video so we all know this is the main area something about this feels weird anyone else feel like this feels weird right now maybe I'm being crazy and while the fire project sounds quicksand I'd rather just have one parameter open like I do for 255 different behaviors I can hardcode because it is so rare that I want a special behavior like that so there's these entrances here you will be able to go into one of these right now they just lead to each other that's obviously not gonna stay like that and when you go into one of these entrances you go into the underground and the underground area is what we're gonna be working on today basically there's just heads up one entrance here one entrance here and one entrance here and they all connect underground through this thing here and underground we need two Yoshi coins and the 8-bit pipe one Yoshi coin is going to be cleaning up another oil spot right here with a shell that's over here and you're gonna have to get there somehow through all these platforming sections and the other one is gonna be sliding down the slide and jumping into this crevice still gonna add anything else to the skybox hmm it is not I don't think I will there were some weird rendering artifacts there what the hell okay there's definitely some weird stuff going on but that's another day to fix oh yeah I'm also gonna make a video on the all-alone bubble don't remix soon that's gonna be fun hello Zeina do you mean to make some stuff just a monkey animations any OST wishes though how about Nintendo songs to go to your first school day there we go nope we're listening to Nintendo songs to go to your first school day what's the video gonna be about see okay when you make a YouTube video you have to find the angle you have to be like this is why and I think I'm gonna frame it as like look with all this optimization artists have so much more freedom and we brought more artists on board which is you and now the game is epic and amazing because we all these optimizations it's gonna be the angle he counts as multiple yeah that's fair it's this mystery dungeon music Pikmin free you have some sick ideas for the Sun the thing is okay I have a problem with this song and that is that I don't know what the theme of after I don't know what the fuck this I just know it's cool to platform on but what is it that's my thing right now like what even is it what are we making of course it's underground but like what is it the outside of the ghost of lungs ass what it looks so cool so thematic it is better texture work and prompts leave a lot to be desired oh you don't like the texture work in the props I guess that's gonna be up to buy a bike but I thought it looked good big pipes and shit heavy metal leaking water boiling oil as the death or maybe a boiling oil I definitely want oil I don't know how to make it boiling big pipes and shit heavy metal all right shit there's actually one thing I had planned was that there would be a huge great at the top and he would be able to use one of the entrances to get to the big great like one would lead to here and one would lead to here and one would lead to slightly higher up so you can get to the great right away but maybe every entrance should be there I think the last entrance is gonna be like from here like so I definitely want the hanging great to wait this sucks I can't do this the last entrance has to be from here something as it needs to lead to a reinforcement oh shit that is so cool what if all of this was like the reinforced window like this is just a window this is just gonna be transparent material may actually just make a window material here hell yeah that is a hell yeah do I not have a glass material the bubble effect outside and you can see the likes of the platforms above mm-hmm that does sound cool I'll leave the exact details to you but I'll definitely put this in for now you know what I already have a glass material why I might not just use it fun fact the word glass is misspelled in the RTYI source code a bunch of times it is what it is honestly same Leela I just kind of animated and then sometimes it turns on well but most of the time it turns on poorly what do you guys think of the new video this new video honestly it's doing all right I'm surprised it was doing pretty poorly at first but it is slowly starting to take off 15k that's it's like a top three video it's own dude every video is doing better than the previous one that's actually crazy my youtube channel is on an upwards draft if I'm a game off I think the thumbnail is good the bows are t2 I can't read the sentence there's a stupid heart in front of it well you know what at block let me get rid of the heart I got rid of it suppose I to never get a track yet yes actually but Duke made a song for it but it's not important yet I can show you maybe let me see if I can pull it up but it's already also making a song for the oil bus that's like this it's fit to the cutscene let me see if I can find the buzzer to all it stopped dude how old is this what the hell this is the buzzer song hello Selton the obvious glaring mistake ah yes the obvious glaring mistake I mean how could I forget about that one what is the obvious glaring mistake that I mean it won't answer instead of answer shit I knew it I knew something was off about the video from the get-go of course it was gonna be such an insidious mistake Leela likey all right Leela Leela likey's this one what what good news everyone Leela likey so I'm just gonna have this be suspended from the top you I'm turning into the internet OOF girl The pills are doing its job So I don't want the player to actually get the idea that I can get up there so I'm just gonna move this down It's definitely not supposed to get up there from down here They actually government mandated you're forced to take him So So we need a way to get to the shell and we need a way to get up here And then after that we're all good Portugal has fallen. Oh, that's where you're from It is okay How is Portugal cuz I don't know I it sounds like a really poor country But I think it's also kind of European. So maybe it's like in the middle between the poor country and like a European country. I Might be mixing it up with something. I have referred to it as Spain my whole life because I thought it was funny A scale from poor to your What do I mean by European I mean Britain, Germany and France. economic crisis government turning to shit etc. I feel like government turning to shit is everywhere. France is spread economically I didn't think so I thought it was doing fine. we need to escape Canada where to we cannot escape to Germany Germany is so shit you guys I'm glad I moved to Canada instead of staying in Germany I would be taxed so much money well politicians have never been popular actually dude which politicians were ever popular now that I think about it I felt like Obama was popular who else who was a politician that actually was in power who was popular Trump was not popular when I lived in Germany I was just working my YouTube channel and I was basically making almost nothing over the minimum tax bracket they're all popular but not always with the good guys okay by popular I mean more than like 70% of the population like them I guess 70% approval rating then that's my threshold for popular so Eisenhower okay I don't know Eisenhower he wasn't alive while I was I think Zelensky was popular during the war maybe yeah that's true Bruno the Mexican president is popular he didn't then I think Merkel was very popular for a while what's his approval rating I think I think Biden is at like 30% right is this his approval rating damn that's not good reset to the bottom I got this is too much for me wait is this I'm not sure I understand no look at the table below okay wait the table below this table here damn damn near 70% across the board and no opinion was an option and he's still almost 70% everywhere I don't know what Castex is just all red why do people hate Macron so much oh he was the prime minister I see I see so that was his his little sidekick was also not popular I think we should refer to prime ministers as sidekicks from now on it's funnier yes we got four courses left after this and some side levels I mean I prefer not to pay generally speaking what's my other option here Carlos I'm not clear on the alternatives I know but do you remember lost impact lost impact I feel like I've heard of that game before Lila made it oh so there's a lot to increase damage from 60 to 64 around 80% of the person is weird with it and then he used a special law to force the bill to pass and said it's for our own good in Germany it's like 68 now dude you have no idea how good you guys have it it was at 65 when I was a kid in Germany I just imagined my dad who has to work pretty hard manual labor having to just stock bricks when he's 65 dude that's impossible honestly yeah a retirement age is kind of a luxury by the time you are old enough to retire if you don't have like a million dollars you kind of messed up oh I see buyer that would make sense sure case should do it how do you become that old without a million dollars just okay wait let's let's think about this let's say you have like ten thousand dollars and you invested for what 50 years you end up with 43 000 all you need in your life is like 250 000 and you're already at a million over your lifetime when I have Rolex bands 50 you've wasted your life why have Rolex who cares about the watch I've got the time on my phone why would I have a watch I said that was a subdivided um because I am developing it right now it is easier to develop it like that so actually think I could look better here also opens up a cool shortcut you can do here which I kind of like I mean what's everything from the kids at work who can't stop diddling their phone on the job oh so you do it so you don't get tempted to look at your phone I don't know I heard Japan is a paradise if you are a white dude I heard I heard they really like white guys there so all right we're gonna have to add bit pipe here I think that works I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do that would you be mad if I replaced your front door with a minecraft piston door no actually I think that would be a very valuable asset I could resell that some minecraft nerd would pay a lot for that to exist in real life it'd be a unique item no one else has I have that issue I sometimes have others hiding in the break room sipping coffee and shitposting on some socmed platform yeah that sucks so see the thing is I'm not tempted to use my phone at all because there's literally nothing to do on my phone so I'm fine with not having a door if it means I have a million dollars I could just get a new door I don't know if this building would spend as much time as possible drinking coffee and playing on my phone it depends on the job and how much you like the people see I actually like the place I work at you know what they did they sent me a whole box of chocolates isn't that fucking sick and this is the best chocolate I've ever had also my boss sometimes sends me cat pictures which I think is very nice I've never seen you online well let's go man has a 3310 what is a 3310 there's also like zero pressure to do anything on the job I'm working at like it feels like I could literally work seven hours a week and they'd be like all right that's fine wooden panels that's actual wood I'm beating the S&P 500 today dude I think the S&P 500 top 50 is soon the thing to be I think we're reaching monopoly end game still barely can't invest on that if you're a Canadian without exchanging to USD which is very expensive to do oh yeah I want to show you guys these too I don't think I've showcased these yet listen closely let's start over here the surface sounds yeah I'm made by Yoshi Milkman he put a lot of work into making this perfect this is the new wood there's a steel glass leaves oh much this is just squishy surfaces like the meat and metal grates yeah they are very ASMR oh all right you can do that that's good thanks for the S-Metal grate is that the one I used here or Yoshi Milkman used rather then so this is where the last entrance is coming from that's gonna be mostly a slide and then you end up here dude that looks fucking wild we should use this effect somewhere oh my god that would be such a cool effect for a level guys what do you think level rayon super fast we still have two side levels it could be one of the side levels  unfortunately it doesn't really go behind mario it just goes behind where you were in level it won't really work for a super speed level yeah so the 8-bit pipe is gonna be here that works for me since these are all gonna be great you are going to be able to see up here break core all right I wonder how break core is gonna even work on the N64 no this is nintendo music to start your day on youtube.com why is there two insides for the oil rig one is underground you're gonna look outside and you're gonna see like the water and the drilling arms and the other is the power plant yeah I don't know if I like break core really like all the break core songs I've heard just seem random but there's one breakout song I really like I don't even know if this really qualifies as break right it's this one here all right so now we just need a way to get up to this here and put a slide there which I guess you can already get up there if you really want but it's a bit too difficult like we can't reasonably expect players to do that it sounds a bit shaky for me I think I actually prefer the ones we have during the vision snare it is visionation snare but I don't know what the album is I am not that well informed on this no this is not an art gallery This is the underground area below the oil rig. Let me actually note down the idea we had for that effect. Level ideas. A level with flame buffer is only cleared with transparent black to get a blur effect. And below the oil rig, just be water. Yes, but it's inside, so you can look outside. I just had a random plant from Mr. Case Emmanuel. We will make something up. We make a block out first and then we just put on a material and it will be something. Do you think I would get if I mailed you the uranium cube? I don't think it would even arrive. And I'm not sure. How radioactive is it, really? Biobak will justify it in post. Alright. I will try to somehow justify it with a few materials, but I will leave the majority to you. This sounds a banger. Yeah, it did just get pretty loud. It's June 2, 38th. Honestly, you would probably just get fined really badly. It actually depends on how good your lawyer is. Wait, so this doesn't count as breakcore? And that's why I like it, because it's not really breakcore. But I like this part too. Crunching cat. Is that the orange cat that goes into the camera? It's a good cat. It's a good cat. Wait, so what's the classical piece? Maybe I don't like the breakcore part. Maybe I actually just like the classical piece. That'd be fucked up. Oh, I actually don't know that, Arthur. I cannot tell you. That's all unknown to me. I'm keeping it. Is that a clip of me doing the crunchy cat? Are you in need of some random assets? I'm looking for freelance work for experience. Actually, yes, I do. There's a lot of assets I need. Do you want to make some? I have an enemy in mind for this. If you want to try it, let me show you. Not these. These, yes. You know these ghosts here? Frizzlet. That's how they're called. Okay, so you know how these go around and they just go into a little electric puddle and then shock you? I want something like that, but made out of oil. And it's gonna go around the level and it's gonna go into a round oil puddle. Like this, but it's gonna be round. And I'm just gonna squish down the Z scale and expand it. And it's gonna damage you if you walk into it. That's a random asset I need. Yes, this one is harsh now. Okay. Monstrous Manor part 4. Ah, shit. Yeah, I do have to do that. I'm just so busy working. Maybe I can do that tomorrow morning. I was planning to do it soon. I think I'm almost done with the game, too. Damn, that's fucked up. Why would your mom scam you better? Sad. What old people have come to. I think it'd be cool if this one was slidey, too. So the player can practice the slidey skills beforehand. Let's make this one slidey, too. And then this needs to somehow lead up here. And I think we can put the shell at the soap bar here. That might be better. And then from here, here, you get up here somehow. Let's just think about how. Let's mash up a few different classical pieces. Oh, I see. What sports or cool events happen in Canada? I don't know.  That's the one where they're on ice and they're hitting each other, right? I feel like they need to invent a good sport. There are just no good sports. They need to make up a good one. I think table tennis is the closest to a good one. But the barrier of entry is so high to that one that it's not really that good. Because it's too difficult to pass the ball back and forth between two bad players. Maybe badminton? I think badminton is maybe a good sport. The thing with basketball is that I don't understand the rules. It seems so wishy-washy. Like, I don't understand when you can touch other people and when you can't. And whose fault it is when two people touch each other. How long you can hold the ball. Stuff like that. No, no, it's not because I can't read the rules. It's because it's hard to understand. Like, what the fuck is going on? Because it's so hard. The rules are so wishy-washy. There's the same problem in soccer. Also, something I don't like is that it's 6 versus 6. I want the sport to be 1v1. Gun duel. The problem with that sport is that you can only do it once. I have never heard of streetball. You are correct. I think tennis is also a good sport. I don't know though. Tennis seems not that great compared to badminton and ping-pong. Sure, badminton, but not very well. And you can have to do that on the CPU. I need to make up a creative way to climb up here. I can't just do platforms. Maybe one of the special platforms we made here would work. What do we have? We have dangling platforms and we have elevators. Is that all? You would like basketball if there were rackets involved? Like everyone would be stationary and they just have a racket to shoot them to each other? Okay, what the fuck is good? I cannot emphasize with that one. We live at 430? Oh, nice. Tennis is actively fun. I think tennis might be too much running around for me though. Fencing. Yeah, maybe actually literal sword fighting might be the best sport. Not fencing though. Fencing kind of fucking sucks. Because the rules are so weird. But like, with better rules and yet like wooden swords or something. Yeah. Okay, you can just waltz up here obviously. That is one way you can get there. But I would like this to be slightly more refined than that. It's called Kendo. Oh. It's just called sparring. I guess. Okay, MMA would be a good sport if it didn't permanently damage your brain while you do it. Also, there's too many rules in it. And if you don't have any rules, it's gonna be a fight to the death, which is also not good. I like sports that have very... The rules are very distinct. As in like the winning and the losing state. When you are within the rules and when you are out of the rules. It's very distinct from each other. There's still ambiguity. Do things opposite to it, but then randomly writes to it. And the original code just reset the position after calling it. Oh yeah, that is very awesome from Nintendo. MMA. No, MMA does have rules. You misunderstood something. I want a cooler kind of platforming in here. Very few and distinct rules. 1v1, no moving, no brain damage. You're too demanding. Well, ping pong and badminton and tennis fit all of those. Hmm. Even slapping causes major brain injuries. Yeah, so slapping contests are out of the equation too. Unfortunate. Competitive thumb war. Hmm. That game might have too little skill involved. And it's too much just based on your physical body. Hmm. Oh, I see, I see. So we have different leagues for different thumb girths. And lengths, I'm guessing. Bonjour? What is Bonjour? Or Vogue, or however you pronounce that. Hello, Blabba Flabba from the Withering Woods. Are you from Banjo-Kazooie? You sound like you're from Banjo-Kazooie. Hmm. Like gay dancing. Gay dancing is a sport. Hmm. There's a German rapper that always talks about how dancing is gay. That's like 90% of his songs. That's what I'm imagining right now. Who? DanteZ. Link Me? Well, he's German. His songs also make no sense at all. DanteZ is like the most nonsensical rapper ever. I wanna hear this so bad. Okay, well. The album that he made the song on is called Lesbians Are Okay, Homos Are Gay. I think that tells you everything. He's just shitposting, but he's actually good at rapping too.  Alright, let's see if we can make the jump. Yeah, pretty easily. Hehe. Hmm. It's not an easy jump. But even if you fail it, like let's say I failed it. I don't think it's gonna be too difficult to just retry. Okay, that jump I just did to get back to the area is more difficult than the area. Yeah, this should definitely go up then. Like so. Unis tennis and real tennis is the difference boys. I think you're talking about, nope, surely they aren't talking about male and female tennis. My perfect one is bowling. Now bowling is too easy. You don't even play against each other. You can just play with yourself. There's a lot of challenge. Don't worry about that. You ever hear German rap on I can, I don't listen to it too much. This song is kind of chill. German rap is ear torture. Zeina doesn't like dancing. She thought he was not a good rapper. Unbelievable. I didn't say you can't just play with yourself. I said you just play with yourself. That's what bowling is. You don't actually play against anyone. Dude, to play bowling against someone, you don't even have to see them in person. Think about that. You could have a bowling match via Zoom. In fact, you could just, you could actually bowl against someone from the 1970s who doesn't bowl anymore. Just imagine he's your opponent. That's it. Same with chess. Well, chess, you at least play against the other person. Optimal sport is pétanque. He just did that to hear me pronounce French. I bet that's like the French word for I'm stupid or something. It's an old people's sport, oh, like golf. There's a lot of people making diss tracks against Drachenlord. Curling, yeah, yeah. For a small ball in the gravel arena, each player has two heavy metal spheres and the goal is to get your sphere as close to the metal ball piglet as possible. Oh, yeah, there's a lot of games like that. I don't think it's too bad, those games. Although those games are, there's no strategy behind them. That's one thing I want in a sport too, I want there to be strategy. I don't want it to just be skill. So something like bowling and dart is definitely just gone. Because there's literally zero strategy to those and it's purely just skill. You want chess? Well, that's not really a physical sport. Oh, this is a, wait, shit, how do you call it? Yes, yes, yes, yes, this is the old people's sport. This is the most annoying sport ever. You guys are so well-off that you don't have this in your country. This is called bowling. And to bowl, you need a real street. You need to go on a real street with your stupid fucking ball. And the goal is to roll the ball down the street. It's kind of like golf, but instead of golfing, you just roll the ball down the street. And I think the winner is whoever reaches it in the least throws. And they do it on real streets and they are always in the way. Look, there's warning signs for them. Look at this. They're always in your way. The show where they build little robots to fight each other. Yeah, that is also very cool. Basketball. Basketball's rules are very wishy-washy to me. It doesn't seem very distinct between that's a valid play and that's cheating. That's why I don't like basketball. Just go play on the highway, honey. True. Welcome back, BlobFlubber. Where were you? Talking to BenJunkazooie? You can chess, but the piece are real people and whenever you... Okay, that just sounds like war better. He just described warfare. Oh, Case, I know the game you want to play. It's called the fucking Crusades. Oh my God, imagine Mr. Beast doing that. He's playing war, but like with real people. And if you survive, you get a million dollars or whatever. This is an idea I actually had. I theorycrafted this with Arthur Tilly. He had a pretty good addition to it. The thing is, you take two poor people. And they play a game against each other. And the person that loses dies and you sell their organs. And the money from selling the organs goes to the other person. So you can merge two poor people into a rich person. Mr. Beast, get on this. No, Blubber, why do you want to change your name? Is there any way I could help you with something, Tilly? I'm sure there is a way. I feel like this jump... Okay, this jump... I know it's course 11. But doesn't this jump feel a little too difficult? I mean, I know it's course 11, but... I know you can just long jump. And you can just double jump. And if you want, you can even just backflip and wallkick and get up there. But, eh? You wanna leave it as is? I'm fine with leaving it as is, honestly. It's course 11. At some point, we have to draw a line. Yeah, the soapbar thing might be more difficult. I don't know. It's a tough decision for me, honestly. He definitely had the wrong sound effect. LZMA? What is that? You mean the compression? The decompression we use? We do have some decompression going on. Look, if I exit the course... That's the speed that decompressors add. And it does that on the N64, too. The thing is, Mario 64's loading times are so fast... That they put an artificial 16 frame delay in there. Because loading was so fast that it was jarring. So, what we do is... We just load... And we decompress, which takes longer. And instead of waiting 16 frames, we just wait 8 frames. And the loading time is the same. You need something that shows up true numbers 1, 2, or 3. And you don't know how to code that. How about... If number equals 1... Or number equals 2... Or number equals 3... Return true. Oh, the XZ decompression. The problem with XZ decompression is that I don't have the code for it. So I couldn't profile it yet. I do want it someday, but it's just not there. You write that, then there shows up an error? I don't know. Maybe you didn't write that. Maybe you wrote it wrong. That's a grammar question, not a programming question, honestly. Not able anyways. I'm... Squallows from the Pharaoh Fortress. No, you're still blub-flub on my screen. I think I want to make the window bigger here. Now that we have so much extra stuff here, the window should be a bit bigger. By the way, I have decided to change my answer to when people ask me what language I program in. Usually I always say English. But I think... What I should say... Just because this is a bit more poetic, I should say... Mostly in English, but sometimes in C. I think that's a really cool answer. I think that will make me look really cool. I don't know. Alright, we got a bigger window. Let's do some basic UV mapping on this. So we have an idea of what this will look like. Expensive computer, extra software permissions, sure. Okay. I don't understand what you're trying to tell me. No, no, it's like... When you say you code in English instead of say you code in C, you're also saying that it doesn't matter. All the programming languages are essentially the same. There isn't really a difference. But then when you say, but also sometimes in C, that's like when you pull out the crazy optimization stuff. The stuff where you directly work with the hard registers. You know what I mean? Hello, Logan Green. I just didn't want to know what language you're programming the game in. They don't want a programming and semantics lesson. Okay, but they are literally seeing the code I'm showing on the screen. So that question is... They're clearly like someone new. They need to know. I have never heard of Silent Hill Ascension though. Like today I had someone ask... Case, what is the difference between English and Japanese C? And I said it's the same, but the variable names in Japanese C are a bit funnier. Yeah. And I think that's a perfect response. Have you seen the goal post thing? This is the funniest. Internally, they refer to this as the goal pole. The goal flag, the goal stopper, the goal. The goal flag, the goal, the goal pole and the girl. Have you heard about Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy? Is that not a movie? I feel like I have seen that the movie exists, but I haven't watched it. She go all on my pole, true. It was a book first. What? It was a thought first. What? How about the fistland? Should I keep something in mind about tech and stuff like prominent signs of Texas? You should probably make the geometry first. And the geometry of this should be around less than 150 polygons, if you can do it. That'd be perfect. For the textures, you have to keep in mind we're limited to 64x64 textures. And without properly understanding how the texture format works, it's unlikely you're gonna pick something good for the texture format. So, honestly, just go with a full-res texture, whatever you think looks good, and then let me downscale it. Is explaining all the intricacies of the texture format gonna take a bit long? We don't always have a 64x64 texture available, is the thing. There's some conditions to it, some limitations. Entire game using only IA textures? That's basically what Banjo-Kazooie is. Actually, no, Banjo-Kazooie uses CI4 a lot. But Banjo-Kazooie uses a lot of intensity textures as well. Wow, this looks completely awful. Interesting. I think for the walls, we should have a rough texture, and then a color transition texture. We should pick a color scheme for this. Dark brown and gray. Looks kind of cool. Favorite movie? Maybe The Truman Show? Hmm. I like movies that have interesting ideas. I don't care about action or suspense or whatever. I know at the end the good guys win. Anyway i know it's just a movie i know it won't be scary because it's just a movie so for me all that works is the ideas and stuff i get from the movie that was a showcase it's in the title no way i think the section is pretty nice actually it gives this room a lot of vibe in case you just want to run let me say i'm madly amazing it's good to have a martha cricket with power to return your silence what else you'll make that's that's nice why do you have a check mark are you famous i'm glad you like to turn your silence we'll keep working on it i think i should make this opening a bit bigger because this i keep saying this the jump's so difficult and you guys keep telling me case it's fine it's course 11 but what if you overshoot like that isn't that gonna be frustrating wait i thought the camera was locked then you need to play better i mean i am good at playing that's not the issue oh you mean if you overshoot you need to play better yeah i guess but even if you overshoot eh okay it looks like even if you overshoot you just kind of do it anyway that doesn't matter this looks difficult well this is course 11 right so it's honestly not difficult at all actually like compared to some stuff other hacks do or you can even do that if you really want you don't even need to have the camera behind you oh that was we have some kind of weird collision bug here for sure like whoa what the hell is that that's also the fact that you don't die for that and that you can just retry so it's not a big deal i think it's i think this amount of difficulty is defensible honestly especially because there's no real punishment for losing it and then we just need the metal planks here this effect is not intentional by the way this will go away i'm very sorry to disappoint see ya logan all right time to place down the 8-bit pipe and then pick a texture for the top parts dude we have 64 viewers today that's nice we're making viewers on youtube again ever since i quit twitch the viewers have been dropping a lot and like 100 before that's nice that we're actually getting viewers again i'm gonna leave a few challenges for the place about 12 years old yeah but we usually when you make a romhack the criticism is always it's too difficult so i've gotten very wary of difficult i have been trying to make my games easier and easier  wait i didn't even actually put the ball pipe in here let me find the correct one xerox f6 interesting i did not think that yeah i hate twitch too i was on twitch today i got a three minute ad break that i couldn't scan i just left never again don't bother with twitch so change the water to metal is this not metal is this rock uh stone shit that might actually be stone okay if you think it's not metal then i guess it's not metal let me find a better texture then hmm yeah it is easier to find other things you're interested in on twitch youtube's more like general influencer things not really a speedrun community thing so in that regard i can't see it but i really hope twitch just dies it's so insufferable to use the website so using chrome with free ad blockers locked into your google account wait what's bad about being locked into my google account also i have six ad blockers so i guess i am a pretty outdoor guy it gives you partner money yeah youtube does pay me for views obviously also for people that use youtube premium you see the premium when you watch my videos i get money from it using more than just ubuntu is actually bad i think it might actually be but the reason i kept installing new ad blockers was because i kept getting ads on pages so whenever that happened i just installed a new ad blocker until the problem went away so yeah that's the power of being the existing platform it's self-reinforcing there's a positive feedback loop just because you are the only the platform  maybe this one's better let me try that one row 182 permission denied my own pc is denying me permissions  oh i like this look kinda how is my name pronounced no one knows not even me i just keep making up new pronunciations whenever i need to this is left as an exercise to the reader so yeah one biomex set so yeah big streamers keep getting corrected on the pronunciation of my name because i keep saying it one way in a video and then i say it another way in the next video so when i work on something and i talk about something or watch something while i work on a i will forever associate the thing with whatever i did on the side so for me looking at this now this is this is talking about sports and finding a good sport but there is none that's what i think of when i see this and it will be forever like that i have way too good of a memory and it's cursing me nice ain't it nice they end up being here and just bring them down every time you say your name in the video put a loud car sound do you also have synesthesia Biobak i do have a lot of synesthesias with like random things like sometimes i mix up letters and numbers or like smells and colors they're just all like one thing my letters of genesis yeah something like that that is the human brain see i think synesthesia actually it's because our brains are so big that they are getting compressed in our skull and neuron clusters belong together our brain's just too big that's gotta be it so totally not just made that up on the spot it's official scientific explanation so dolphins aren't true yeah don't they have like the biggest brain to body ratio or something but i think the neural density is way lower than humans so fuck that that works tom big brain does not mean smart what you're telling me that whales are not the smartest creature in the universe so i don't think i have it with sound and color so i thought the biggest predictor for intelligence in an animal species was neural density maybe not maybe that is totally rubbish now this needs to be metal i don't know why i'm looking at tiles now all these textures are just ripped from random video games and some of them are made by other people like zaino so this texture is kind of nice i pitched this blue and low pitched this red that makes sense if you think about wavelengths yeah what michi said as well like no wait am i wrong i thought low wavelengths was blue so shit what am i getting wrong here like blue is very high energy so it's a short wavelength no well yeah but while it is next to blue mandela effect no it's just flipped somewhere because frequency and wavelength are inverse to each other so left is blue right is red no way it's the other way around why not this higher frequency yeah so blue is higher frequency than red so it would be higher pitch there you go that's what i thought so red is on the left exactly now blue is on the right and violet is on both ends it's fucked up so ah yes looking at texture stream you say it's yellow and finally the dark green said it is gray okay what the fuck this is newest one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen four five six seven eight eight sixteen sixteen and ten actually not sixteen and ten what the hell one two three four five six seven eight nine nine nine it's not nine either oh nine ten eleven of course There we go, now it's spaced correctly. Did you miss anything? You missed everything. We were talking about sports, about synesthesia, about gaming, about what color math is. English is blue, German is brown, bio and chemistry are green? Chemistry was always yellow for me in school. People who wipe sitting and people who wipe standing on both sides of the debate have no idea the other side exists. Hello KakeDev. Okay, I do not want to know anyone's pooping habits though, so that's not a conversation I want to have right now. Yeah, I figured out there was an ever wiper. You know what, save the trees. Wipeless Wednesday? The fucked up part is, I can actually imagine people doing that. People have done less useful things for the environment, like banning plastic straws. Wipeless Wednesday doesn't seem that far-fetched anymore. More personal carbon footprints. What was the trend called? Save the turtles? The thing that the little girls did? And then they made weird sounds? VSCO girls? Wipeless Wednesday VSCO girl. Okay, this texture is kinda nice. Although not fitting together very well. I like the texture, I don't like the context the texture is being used in. No shit September? Oh no. Okay, talking about shit is too nasty now. There are too many bad questions on my mind. It is random geometry data. I referred to the people on Gaslighting modpcport as the Arthur Tulli army in my comments today. Wait, what the hell Zeina? Why did they only deliver the food? What did they say? Okay. That's weird. There seems to be a bug. It looks like I can wallkick after that. No, disrespecting authority is perfectly fine in this chat actually. The only bannable offence is being annoying. Where's Fish Simmered from food? They are live fish, Biobak. We're getting live fish. I have an aquarium over there. I would show you, but you will have to wait until the house tour I think. Somehow they offered free shipping on everything, so I just took it. But I guess free shipping didn't actually include everything.  I think the colors need to be inverted, kind of. We did not pay for shipping just to go get them. No ship Saturday. Well, they shipped half of what we ordered. Apparently. Oh, that's much nicer looking. That is correct, Mr. KakiDev. But even if they were genuinely hateful, I don't think I would be bothered. That's the thing. I don't care. No, it's fish food, Biobak. We ordered fish food for the fish that we ordered. Damn, KakiDev kills crickets. I think I should use the same texture for this. Weight elevator, maybe? Would it look weird to have the exact same texture still as the weight elevator and then not have these act as weight elevators? I think so. I have never used DoorDash in my life, but they all thought free shipping if we use DoorDash. So from my experience, it's literally free. You know what I did? There was a tipping prompt that came up. And the tip options were $1, $2, $3, or custom. I clicked custom and picked zero. That's how cheap DoorDash is. Zero dollars. That's where they run away with your fish. No, they only have the fish. And the fish was $6. Why am I so evil? I'm not gonna tip. I don't like to donate to random companies. The hell? If you wanted more money, you should put a bigger amount of money on the bill. What is that? Why are you asking me for mercy to pay your employees? I am not up for that. I would like to know the price up front. Then I decide whether I want to pay it or not. You have to put the disclaimer that you're not American. I am not American. There you go. I guess that's definitely a difference here. Why would I have a tip? Just think about it. Why would I pay $12 if the item costs $10? I simply prefer to have the $2. Now I already found out about the secret tax they have in Canada. What? We're gonna pick them up? How come they're not delivering it right now? Did they say anything about why? Is it because I didn't tip? What? See? Okay, look. Okay, okay. This is another thing. Why would you tip before you receive the service? Look what happened. They gave us such a shitty service, they forgot half the order. I am so glad I didn't tip. Honestly should have tipped. No! They got my order wrong. Also, yeah, tipping for an app seems like a bad idea. Oh, for American daughters you tip both? Both the app people and the people that brought you the food? Yeah, that makes sense. Do you tip them to DoorDash for no... Tipped off DoorDash? But we paid literally $0. I didn't even understand how that works. How come we can pay $0 for that? That doesn't even make any sense. What's their business model? They can choose to give... Oh, so they're holding my order hostage? We've turned this from a gratuity into a hostage situation? Can you maybe see why I don't want to deal with a fucking hostage situation? Actually, what's the Nash Equilibrium on hostage situation? Because, think about it. Okay, think about it. Wait, let me get on paint. Let's say you do have a hostage, right? Let's make a matrix here. So, let's say there's a guy who has a hostage. And he's saying, give me the money or I will kill the hostage, right? So, his options is kill hostage and don't kill hostage. And my option is give money and don't give money. Think about this. This is something no one thinks about. So, let's say I give him the money and he releases the hostage. No, I give him the money and he kills the hostage. Obviously, terrible for me. Minus 2 points for me. For him, he got the money, but he also committed a bigger crime of killing the hostage. So, for him, that's like maybe 1 payout for giving him money. And 0.5 negative payout for actually committing the bigger crime. So, this is it. Let's say I give him the money and he doesn't kill the hostage. That's minus 1 for me. Or actually, it's 0 for me because I saved the hostage. And it's 1 for him because he got the money. Let's say I don't give him the money and he kills the hostage. Now, for me, I didn't lose the money. So, this is only a minus 1 because I lost the hostage. But for him, he just committed the bigger crime of killing the hostage on top of taking the hostage. So, for him, that's a minus 0.5. Lastly, I don't give him the money and he doesn't kill the hostage. Which means I saved the hostage and he doesn't commit the bigger crime. Now, in any scenario, you see how in his situation, if he goes from killing the hostage to not killing the hostage, his equity increases. That means he has no incentive to actually kill the hostage. Which means he should never do this. It'd be stupid for him. This doesn't exist. So, now I just have the option between giving money and not giving him money. Because he should always choose to not kill the hostage. For this reason, he should never negotiate with hostage takers. It doesn't make any sense. Not dying is positive. Yep, that was considered as a positive. That's the Prisoner's Dilemma. Is it the Prisoner's Dilemma? It's not the Prisoner's Dilemma, no. It's completely different from the Prisoner's Dilemma. The Prisoner's Dilemma has two equilibriums. This one only has one. That was a cringe comment, I'm sorry. It is not the Prisoner's Dilemma. I'm saying I'm sorry for your being cringe, not I'm sorry for what I said. That's if you assume hostage takers have calculated the fucking Nash Equilibrium. You think people taking hostages are not smart enough to calculate the Nash Equilibrium for their decision making process? No way. It's not the point of the Prisoner's Dilemma. No, no, no, no, no. It's different. Very different. In this, he has no advantage to betraying. That's the difference. You can completely eliminate one part of it. This is not a useless philosophical thing. This is a hard mathematical fact. This is the convergent Nash Equilibrium to this situation. If you don't know how to calculate the Nash Equilibrium for anything, how do you even make decisions in your everyday life? That person already has a lot of negative equity, they probably wouldn't care. That's true. Also, there's actually a thing to this. Where if you kill the hostage, the next time you take a hostage, you have more negotiation power? Okay, it doesn't matter what the number is though, Biobak. Because it's just a scalar. It's just a number above zero. That's all that matters. It's similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma in that both are Equilibriums, yes. And that way is also similar to playing Rock-Paper-Scissors or playing League of Legends. You first need the option to make decisions. But you do have that. I can't make cereal in the morning without... Calculating the National Equilibrium, first story of my life. The guy would kill... Well, you still get a bigger sentence after you killed someone. Even if you already killed 10 people, killing 11 people is a worse crime. Wait, actually, what if you killed so many people that you are guaranteed to never get out of prison again? At that point, you become indifferent between the two options. And now it still doesn't matter. Is he giving the money or not doesn't affect his decision making, does it? Why would it? This is something I think about a mile back. It doesn't matter. This is a pretty standard thought for me. Have I had a police encounter? Yes, I got stopped for running a red light on my bike when I was 13. And then I got stopped for driving without a light on my bike like five times. And I got fined every time. Eventually, I started looking out for the police. Actually, I started looking out for the police after the first time I got run at a red light. I rarely get caught nowadays. Okay, but say you're well known mafia boss or something. So if you killed a hostage without getting money, your reputation would go to shit. That's true. If you plan to take more hostages, it does make sense to actually comply. So what was he? Well, the thing is my light was broken. So my payout for getting the flight fixed is like losing $20. Or yeah, losing $20. But if I drive without a light and I get caught, there's a small chance I have to pay the fee, which is I think $50. So on average, it made sense to not get the light fixed. Yes, in real situations, there is way too many. That is true. It's not reasonable to actually compute an equilibrium for most decision-makings, but you can kind of guess what it would be. Am I trolling? No. One of these kinds of situations, I don't know if it's true, but they kinda suck. Picture of textures. Wait, what nipple? Can you show me the boss made out of oil? I want reference texture for the oily. Sure. It does use some environment effects though, environment maps. So the texture kinda moves with the camera. I can just apply this material to the thing, really. Well, me scamming them has a very bad payout for me because it would ruin my reputation and I would get cancelled. For me, actually, it makes a lot of sense to always act moral, even if I don't believe in morality, simply because I would get cancelled. So that's how you can guarantee that I will act like a good person. Are you saying I get paid in exposure? Well, you can't do that after you promise someone money. Pascal's Wager of YouTubers. Pascal Wagers again. That's for believing in God. That was Pascal's Wager. The hostage takeout with getting cancelled. I'm sure that will fear him. I promise to pay. I will pay you $500 in exposure. $500 worth of exposure. Dude. I mean, okay, think about it. Brilliant paid me $1300 per video. Me mentioning your name in my video. That's like $300. I do that twice. We're fine. Honestly, you should pay me back. Is that what influencers do to small businesses? Do they? Do you think I could do that? Go to a small business. Ask for free ice cream. Tell them I'll pay them in exposure. How is it so hard to find a good great texture? This could maybe work if it was darker. Well, that looks terrible. Yeah, these aren't great. True. I think Biobak can ban you for saying that. He's a mob. Damn, he went through with it. I do kind of like these. But they are. They don't value the sites evenly. How much is the mod status cast? Honestly, you can't buy it. Make me a good offer. I might say yes. But I will unmod you if you abuse it. But for a good offer, I'll mod you. Fuck it. So do you have an animated face or you always keep the face aesthetic? When we have an animated face, we usually use a face that's usually just animated with the texture. But this is a very simple area. So we can give him some animation bones. But you should probably let me make the rig because N64 or Mario 64 has very specific requirements for the rig. So you can't just make one. Oh, animated faces and UV maps. Sure, that works. For $400,000, I will definitely mod you. For $400,000, I'll give you this whole channel.  Maybe I can make this work somehow. It's just a bowser level texture. I don't really know what private education is. I've never seen anyone get privately educated in Germany. I think that's illegal actually. I think you have to send your kids to the States to learn in Germany. None of these are very great. I'm just trying to just think of how to make one of these work. But all of this is just failing. Schulpflicht, exactly. You have to go for nine years, I think. Wow, Arthur, that's such a bad ban. Someone ban Arthur for that. Unbelievable. I can't believe he would say something like that. No, not for five minutes, Lila. That's too long for a joke. You can't do that. That's just sad at that point. You can't do that. That's just mean. That is mod abuse. You have to undo it. How? I don't know, Lila, but you better figure it out. Or you will be in trouble. I don't know how to do it either. What the junk? Dude, Arthur, you should have just stayed quiet for five minutes and told Lila that you're still banned. It would have been so funny. Missed opportunity. You could have gaslit her. She would have felt so bad. Maybe one of these can work as crates. Maybe I should just do this. This text is fine, honestly. And we do want it to be distinguished from the dangling platforms anyway, so maybe having them be crates like this is fine. Wait, why did you ban him this time? I missed it. What are you doing? I will just trust whatever's happening. You made another great show. He's going to come back and make another one. Like for sure. Why wouldn't he? I would make one too. At this point, if I was him, I would make another great show. This wasn't Star Wars. Is a good song. All right. What is the subatomic precision shit about? Man, I mean the half minute might really make a difference. That's like 20% of the time at 10%. Yeah, I think this platform is nice now. I'm going to have them hang from the top and it's going to look all cool. Ever for less than five minutes. I don't know. Maybe Google knows. Oh, yeah, I really like this. This looks great in gameplay. The repetition on the sides though is kind of bad. I don't like the sides here. This part repeats too much. I'm going to be able to access the test room. Nope. They're not even going to be in the room. They will be completely overwritten. This looks bad. I am thinking of porting just Delphino Plaza over to this engine and put it on the N64 and be like look the N64 could have played Mario Sunshine. Just to fuck with everyone. I think it'd be a very powerful showcase of the engine. I would definitely blow people's mind. All right, I think this looks good and I'm going to go out with Zayna now. Yeah, I did make the water recently. It looks fine. But yeah, I will be going now and I'll see you guys next Saturday and tomorrow short whatever that will be. Bye. Bye.
