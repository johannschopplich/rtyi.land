Hello. Hello, Smashy. Hello, Zayna, hello, MarioLuigi, Mario64, SuperMario64, hello, Clayman. Fellas, we are so close to getting monetized on Twitter. It's crazy how easy it actually was to get monetized on Twitter as soon as we started trying. We are probably finishing this today. We can already think of names for the stars and stuff. Okay, bad idea. Let's pick something grayish. And put this here. That will be a little less awful. Eww, that was the wrong downscaling method. Why does this look so much worse than the Luigi half? I think that looks fine. Maybe Peach needs to be a little bit bigger compared to the rest. How about 64x127? Yeah, yeah, I think that's kind of nice. Yeah, how about that? Meowty part, no. It's kind of fitting that the Peach cutout looks a little nicer compared to the others because she's a royal. Lights button near her right arm. I don't see it. Hello, Palka. So we need to make up star names too. Hello, SonicTheHedgehog68. Yeah, yeah, the resizing will hide some flaws. Hello, SonicTheHedgehog68. Hello, SonicTheHedgehog68. The best Zelda game of all time, by far. No one comes second. Hello, TeaTime. Oh, nice, mid-jawless mask. Mid-jawless mask. I'm not happy with how I cut this, actually. It's gonna be rougher because of how high poly she will otherwise be. I'm not happy with how I cut this, actually.   It's an adorable peach drawing. Yeah, Laira made it. Send the shit out of a dumbass only for being a dumbass. They sued a streamer for streaming their games, right? Honestly, I know the guy was a dumbass, but I hope Nintendo loses. Because that would be a net positive for the entire video gaming industry. And for the entire YouTube streaming community. Because, I mean, I think Nintendo is in their right to tell someone, like, you can't play our games on stream. Right? I think that's perfectly in their legal right. But I don't like that it's in their legal right. That's the issue. That's why they sued him. But that's not what they're suing them for. Imagine if Nintendo was legally allowed to just execute people on the spot when they feel like it. And they decided to execute people for, I don't know, something morally reprehensible. For uploading viruses to Mario Maker or something. I still wouldn't like if Nintendo just went and executed someone. Yeah, exactly. You get what I mean. It is very ominous, isn't it? Each drowned true. It's crazy, something like Ben drowned existed. And people were taking it serious. The good old days of the internet. Nowadays people are trying so hard to pretend that they take something like that serious with their ARGs. Oh my god, I have to rant about ARGs. Whenever there's an ARG and there's, like, a bunch of 0's and 1's, you're just supposed to type into a hex editor to get a hidden message and ASCII. It's some kind of crazy encryption. I hate that. I'm not even into ARGs, but, like, god damn dude. You're just giving away that you don't understand anything. I will not be drawing Peach giving birth. Thank you very much. I need to use the extra expansion pack RAM for? Mostly I use it to make development easier. If I just say fuck it, I'm not even gonna try to stay in four megabytes of RAM. I can just be like, you know, loading all my code at once, loading the entire level at once. If I wanted to stay in the four megabytes of memory, I would have to optimize memory a lot and I don't want to do that. It just reduces the development time a lot. So I was scripting out a video about the hidden half a megabyte of RAM in the N64 and I think it's gonna be a banger video. I can already tell that video is gonna do really well. I've been using FAT64 for years. Where have you been? I've been like four years since I started using FAT64, maybe five. Yo, it's the milk bar. I've been home. Did I miss something? I was told to ban someone. And the level is taking forever to export. It's a big level. The properties of all the Mario faces. That was sexy for cutting them up. I know, I don't know if I showed you, but this is done now. Maybe I finished it off stream. I don't remember. So she will need one sad animation and one happy animation. Someone say MILF? Lilaa, you are not a MILF. No, but never mind Just because you're 18 now Doesn't mean you can start saying stuff like that You're still 16 to me. All right Is peach milf, I mean she's buzzer juniors mom, right? Or is that no longer true It's actually so funny that Maurice sunshine made you think she was peach juniors mom for so long and then only at the end they Reveal that's fake I Know No, sue this man, he's spreading false information Mistakes like a high school boy what you I bet you sneeze like a kindergarten girl Fuck you Loudly and exaggerated that's how high school boys sneeze Yeah, you probably sneeze like it's you What are we even arguing theory and where Bowser jr. Comes from those balls You Just don't emphasizes limit your mods in any way No, but I Want to stick to the 64 megabyte limit because that's what they worked with back in a day. So I'm going over that would feel like cheating It's also kind of nice to have some real limits because otherwise it's like Otherwise I feel like I can just like keep adding more and more and I do want to be done eventually You I've like one From not I've seen half life 1. Yes easily I've seen half life 1 in the past   fourth life fifth life sixth life seventh life eighth life  tenth life eleventh life twelfth life twelfth life nineteenth life twelfth life twelfth life  twelfth life What does peach do? She is surrounded by three symbol guys and you kill them all Why my blocked in a chat? I wrote that your head can explode in few holes to sneeze in when I was blocked I'm not sure I didn't block anything Was that a Twitch chat? sometimes twitch auto moderates something so maybe I thought you said something really bad but no, I don't block anyone if you think that's the case my dream job? I mean ideally I wouldn't need a job many of my messages don't go through maybe it's like if you make really long messages YouTube automatically blocks them I don't know, YouTube has really weird filters I don't have any of them active or not on purpose I don't know I'm not sure why that would be maybe try shorter messages was it a really long message you tried to send? I'm literally just a princess true Lila, so true princess Lilaa that was not intended to happen even now             why not? there is a soundtrack for the course and it's pretty good what does that mean? that's a function that makes NPCs talk to you and rotate to you when certain conditions are met just makes my life easier I'm so stuffy today okay, anim state is 0 interesting not a single object meets these conditions why would this be? Lena gets people sick just like a cockroach can anyone tell in the next plot? it's just a joke because of your sneezing maybe that's why maybe YouTube thought you were sending me a death threat I don't know is this termina field? oh my god, it's so good your head explodes like a balloon nooooo I hope your head deflates like a balloon my head is not full of helium sorry could it be because of the object list? I don't know surely not oh, this guy loves FigureVid that's all he talks about all day is this what people call autism now? I don't know it's perfectly normal to meow your songs and you sing your songs you go la la la it's just objectively worse you hum it? nah no no what happens when I do this? when he starts a new tag like around 180 something like that let's go of course there's a star with the painting Mario interesting permanent loop that shouldn't be happening what the hell imagine if that area didn't have a star you would just be very confused and we wanna avoid that oh  oh   no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no   no        wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow    wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow       so the machine is our problem what does that mean? to answer whether you can program a game with curry you have to define what a game is the exit? yeah that's a good one too wait i never set listhead? no wonder it didn't work that explains everything i don't want to make a weak game where's the ea sound from? smash plus melee it still finds zero that's bizarre oh they're pushable makes sense you know what i'm gonna do this, it only runs once anyway i don't know what a query is so i can't answer the question oh this should not give me the star in a permanent loop Hmm doesn't quite make sense to me I think the definition of Mario Galaxy 64 would be to just remake Mario Galaxy on Mario 64 which is pretty doable. Well you probably not really do it in Mario 64 but you could do it on the N64. I mean if you can render on the database essentially you can render 3D games. You can ASCII art it. It uses 0 for white pixels and 8 for black pixels There's something else we are overwriting. Maybe here Helmingham lockdown. Where's my twitch bros? I just see YouTube comments Yeah this stream and the last stream have been pretty dead. Hello Mushclips I mean she's supposed to spawn a Yoshiko and not a star I'm less active. Yeah a lot of Lilaa fans have been disappearing recently from the stream It's probably because of you I mean do you think Nintendo would pay me enough that I would want to work there? It's also the side of the equation here It doesn't pay badly. I don't actually know how much they pay relative like other companies But the benefits of working at Gears are crazy Probably because the company is from like Denmark and Denmark has like crazy laws that really really benefit workers and I think they want to stick to it even though they technically don't have to. I think they just want to stick to it because I don't know why But for working in Nintendo to be worth it I'm assuming I would have to give up my modding but for that to be worth it and assuming you have to pay like work like 40 hours a week um there's the fact I would lose like all my my games that I'm working on on YouTube and it would curb a lot of my ambition of like making mods in my own games Actually I would still probably be allowed to make my own games. I don't know I would have to be like 110,000 or 120,000 or so Now I just need to spawn a Yoshi coin And of course I would have to be working on games I actually like otherwise I don't want to work there at all My 16k fee? What fee? Nintendo pays more than that? I don't know Nintendo is a Japanese company Let's google average Nintendo programmer salary. I think Japan is pretty cheap Oh never mind. 218k? What? That's way more than I thought they would. Oh but it's United States Junior is 38 to 50k 116k I don't know Inglis is really ugly. Oh On the level detection you can also see how many Yoshi coins you've collected in a specific level Maybe I'm not sure yet It will definitely show you whether you've collected a star for the Yoshi coins Which you know that should be good enough All right this should do it Now as soon as I beat the Shy Guys and talk to Peach I should be getting a Yoshi coin from her I saved your mom from the thimble guys yesterday and she gave me a Yoshi coin No I'm not gonna reference my own work in this game I don't know if it's just that it will run. It already does run on N64. That's a crazy part Dude I wish N64 emulators were more accurate. We could use half a megabyte of extra data just stored between bytes. It would be so cool to just make use of that Even if I don't have to even if I just do it because I can it would be cool I was forced at gunpoint to remaster one well I definitely would pick the computer stage because it has the most interesting theme Is it fair to always put words and thoughts in a second language? Me and words is weird because I used to be a really eloquent speaker. I used to be really at putting words into sentences and this was despite me not thinking in language I'm thinking in like logical blocks basically if that makes sense but after I spent like four years not talking at all I became a lot worse at it and the language in which I talk does not make a difference I'm just like kind of mid at talking in both languages unless I'm really focused on it okay so we got peach working and yuki said she wanted to try animating her so burger pizza okay burger is peak if it's just bread meat and salads but if you put like condiments in there i don't eat condiments then i'm thinking a pizza but the pizza has to be a salami pizza or pizza with a lot of meat all right um let's think about the star names star one how much doodle star after castle platforming you can put cheese and tomato on my pizza but what the f**k is guacamole two doodle star after castle platforming cardboard castle climbing cardboard castle climb and then oh the one where you draw for luigi doodle for luigi color for luigi crayon coloring no do you read comments or just the hearted comments i read all the comments i mean one just one more in the hall of the cardboard king i'm gonna think about that where do i render these uh here h-a-n-d-a-d-e so it should be nine let's see what else we can do for handmaid heights let's see that hey all right this could look really cool if we move it to the right a little bit do you still draw cocks no no and made heights that's almost good the heights it just feels like it goes further to the right like it needs to am i i'm not editing the right thing all right it's not like that can we super dumb mario 2 what makes you so super dumb so yeah so so oh wait i was editing the wrong variable the one that looked wrong it's gonna be one of two factor five games but i also don't know which one all right i think now we've got it of course not giving the bunny art hold on let me glance at this but it's just a wiggler Luigi's crying bunny Rory yes it is Alice it's just stretched widescreen and the game itself turns a little more widescreen so they cancel out to just looking normal crayon draw okay crayon star snow there's that's in the snow biome um it's kind of like a rescue mission rescue the crayon what's um let's do Tessarus safe free redeem deliver um how is pervert and Tessarus for coloring do you prefer adventure games mmo competitive or platformers i mean platformers are adventure games and competitive mmo stuff it's more like a sport in the game devon is no stars color yeah that's that's rubbish um remember the crayon there has to be a word for safe that starts with assuming it's no stained crayon it's too long yep 15 like in vanilla more 64 it's yellow it's drawing deliver the drawing i kind of like to bring luigi in this though so luigi's big plan luigi's a big day Which is crayon, I think that's fine. Star 3 inside the cardboard box. Oh right, with Zipper, and Zipper but from hell. Okay this star is a bit weird, especially name wise, I'm not sure what to do for that. Hell in his depression evil face, true. So for this star you have to tear open the box here. And then jump down into hell. Saw plank paper. Saw plank speed paper, I don't know. Handmade hell. Can we say hell? Isn't this like a game for American children? I'm going to complain if we say hell. Zip through the Zipper realm, oh I like that. Zip through the Zipper, without the realm. Next is fly through the paper targets. So there is the paper targets you fly through. Zip through the targets, Yoshi target effects, none of them, just an alteration. How do you call it, it's not a target right, Bullseye, blast the bullseyes. Doodle for Luigi, sounds better than Akiyo, I doodle for Luigi, fine. Doodle for Luigi. Hermit Tersarus, Tomb, Shrine, Monolith, has 13 and doesn't have star names, you're right it does not. EMS music, this is Majora's Mask. Our coins. It does go a lot into communism if you just read Tersarus, but wait isn't red the republicans and now it's all socialist? Isn't that a little bit of the opposite of what they want? Coins in the pyramid labyrinth, that's a lame name. Coffin, coins in coffins, no, catacombs. What do catacombs look like? What is a catacomb? It's associated with the Roman Empire so I don't think this is a good one for the The closest to that is purple, a lot of people think purple is red, crypt, what is a crypt? Hermit puzzling for red coins, that's the best I can think of. Really a lot of ideas. Now for the pipe, you see the left side of the building and the dark one is the right and the right side is the left, we're about a hundred years since when the colors are reversed in the US, oh you see, interesting, maroon, wait that's kind of red, is it not? That's an interesting idea, mummy's maroon coins, money's maroon money, oh that's kind of good, mummy's money's maroon money, 8 bit painters, that's a 16 bit right? But yeah, retro pipe painting kind of works, retro pipe painting, sure why not, I want to go back to PC again. Hello Tanya. All we need to do now is add Bowser here. Bowser walks here and he tries to aim fireballs at you and you just dodge them left to right. He should probably change her text when you get her star. Just don't change his text when you get the star. I guess he doesn't need to. He should though. Yuki wanted to do the drawing so I'm waiting for that. If she doesn't then we consider this done in a day stream. Then we'll just do this off stream. It's not a big amount of work. B-param for... We already have three times as much text as Mario 64. Keep that in mind. Hello, it's back. Hello. Course 15 is an arcade. Which I think is cooler than a casino. Okay, the thing about a casino is they give you real money. So the games are designed in a way that you can lose or can only lose. In an arcade you can win. If you're really good at the games or you find like a trick. In casinos not so easy. So I found a way in my local arcade to get $100 worth of stuff for like $50. Fun fact. So I was like, I'm gonna go to my local arcade and get $100 worth of stuff for like $50. And I told them and they ignored me. So now whenever I need a new gaming console, I'm gonna go to my local arcade and get it there. So Help me. It's gonna be your first text. $450 minus $256. $184. So So Super fucking Mario. Hello, Holly. Sorry, it's so cute. Did I not export the level? It'll exist? Congratulations. So There was someone that wanted to contact you, Holly. They wrote me they wanted to know some kind of song from Mario 64 and who composed it. I don't know if they ever did contact you. Help me. No. There we go. Oh my god, that's definitely a bug I want to fix. I don't want Mario to just go through them when both are diving. Hey, it works. That makes sense, but wouldn't they send you a message request first? They are very much like bullies, not much difference. Oh, okay, so they probably just couldn't find you. So Come on Oh All right, um I don't have cardboard Bowser yet. So Honestly kind of done I'm, not sure what else to do Is there anything I forgot to do in this level? I don't think so. I think that's all. Uh Oh I don't feel prepared for a roblox stream. I'm not doing that today. I'm just joking half joking um We can take a look at course 15 see what we can plan there Let's take a look The ones are still spawning out of nowhere if you want to fix that fair fair, yeah Although I don't know what to put up there either. So We're gonna know it when people in the comments of case i'm sniffing every single thing I mean, okay. Sometimes there's stupid suggestions like Case, can you add an option to switch between the old exclamation box and a new exclamation box for people that want to see? the old one in the game Is You want an option in the options menu for this one texture Um But other than that, no stupid suggestions I just ignore At this point I just get i'm laughing at it, I think So Oh giant space arcade mostly low gravity, but some parts are normal I had this plan as a low gravity level Since you can see the planet and stuff in the background and then I have this linked Interesting What the fuck is this level? This is the first version of course 14 when we're testing the art style. Stills all on low gravity? I'm not sure. I'm thinking we mark specific low gravity places instead of doing it the other way around. Because playing with gravity is a very fun concept for a level I think. We have an option to make Mario blink slightly more. True, true. That do be kind of what people are asking me. Astral Arcade. That's a good level name. What did I export this to? These are slides. We can already name it Astral Arcade. Just to be already having that down there. Behave alien is unused. Or not existing. Makes sense. Can you imagine if Nintendo added options like that? Imagine if Nintendo added an option to change the shades of Mario slightly instead of FF 0C 0 0. I'm thinking like FF 0 3 0 0. So yes, the big secret. The whole hack I made with Eiza for this Gadabox slide was already kind of me making the assets for this slide. So the flying asteroids here, you're probably going to keep seeing in the hack. The UFO I'm standing on maybe. The satellites definitely. So you're going to need 64 Land remake. This song is in 64 Land, isn't it? I think Badub already made a song for this too. But yeah, I already like how the background looks. We're probably going to slightly improve it for the final version. I think it's A2. I'm surprised you know 64 Land that well. You're just proud of the work you did on it and that's why you remember it so much. To me, the anxiety of working on 64 Land is a blur in my memory. I don't remember that I made that game. It's like someone else took position of my body and made it. Can I also under planet move? Nope. Let's check if Badub ever sent me a song for this. Then we can import that already. I love working with a song already made for the level because it gives me so many ideas for the vibe. Okay. Die Karotte, Cardboard, Pyramide, Aquarium, Icy Runway, Sub Ice Castle. Nope.  Nope.    A2. Ace Idea, Mario Sliding Drums. Yeah, I like that. Elevator, Electro-Tunnel. What else? Ice Castle Outside. Oh, that's kinda nice. No, this is a Funky Space Casino. What did I say to this back then? Alright, this is the one. Yeah, this is a Funky Space Casino. It's pretty nice, I think. Smash Bros. Melee! It's Smash Bros. Melee! I hear it! It's Smash Bros. Melee!  Is it Flashback?  Is it Flashback?  Is it Flashback? Is it Flashback? Is it Flashback? You've listened to this a million times? I didn't realize he uploaded this to Soundcloud already. I didn't realize he uploaded this to Soundcloud already. Skybox unavailable? Cool. But I think we already have the Skybox, so we don't need that.  Ah yeah, this was the Skybox idea. Obviously. Ah yeah, this was the Skybox idea. Obviously. Big Arcade Building? Oh, this is what I wanted. Big Arcade Building? Oh, this is what I wanted. That's a fun one. And this was an idea I had written down. I think the Madrozen Mask OST is almost done now. It's a pre-rendered song. Pre-rendered songs have the advantage that they're really fast to render, but they have the disadvantage that they cost a lot of ROM space, so we have to be very selective when we do a pre-rendered song. Does anyone know the exact looping point for this? Is anyone good at that? Hey Holly, you know music. Where's the looping point? Wait. Holly, where's the looping point? Tell me. It looks like it's around here. Sample 110356. Sure. Let's listen. It's coming out of the wrong speaker. It sounds pretty similar, right? Yeah, I think the looping point is around here. 215, way before that. Let's listen. This is probably really loud for you guys, is it not?  Sounds like there's a slight transition back into the loop. I think so too. This kind of overlaps here. Moving more to the left. The left? There's a lot of delay on stream, so I'm not sure if this is what you mean. You sure about that? This shit's wrong. Yeah, we want this to be as small as possible. I think this has to be further to the left now. Maybe so? Oh, that feels pretty right. And then there's probably one beat to get back to normal. Just to make sure that any lingering effects don't stay. Yes, we want them to stay. This doesn't look the same. Do I have the wrong place entirely? No. It looks similar, but not the same. Much it's slightly right. Surely, at some point, these waves should be exactly the same, right? And then I can just move them there. That's usually how I do this. If you look between these two. Is that it? I don't know if that's right. That doesn't seem right. I think I'm completely wrong. If you can do it, do it, Holly. That would be really cool. Okay, I think this ends up being a little bit better. I don't know if it's too bad right now. But it might be after a while.    It's nice to see these kind of effects. It's nice to see these kind of effects.  I'm not sure I understand this. Girly! What do you think? You think that we can do it in another city? I don't know what helps. I'm getting the peaks of the waveform and the line-up together. That's exactly what I tried. Yes, yes, Biobak, we're planning Course 15. Course 14 is done. All that's missing is one asset, which I'm still waiting for from Yuki. Shouldn't have done a DAW. Well, I don't have one. The easiest way is to just know the looping points. Usually, Badub knows them, but I didn't ask. Usually, it takes me 5-10 minutes to do it. I'm sure Holly can do it in 5 minutes. Yes, that's the idea.  Imagine.studios. I definitely want a bunch of pixels out here. Where there are lights. I think that would be very cool. I'm going over it right now. You've seen this, right? This is probably going to be the basic setting. The basic background, the basic vibe of what this level will look like. I'm definitely not going to reuse the slide here, though. I just can't let go of last time. They just fit so well together. This is going to be our version of Rainbow Road. What I have so far is... I want a big building like this. I think it would be funny. I think I want the building to have this vibe here. And then we have this game here written down. I don't know what the fuck my idea with this was, though. It says, back wall is slanted. Coins in the slot machine that you have to reach. Star on top of the coins. Don't know if I like that. Don't know if I like this game in general. This definitely goes into questionable games and not into star games. Because this one kind of sucks. Pinball machine with red coins? It's written down in my notes. I think not. Whack-a-mole is a fun arcade game. An out-of-yourself game where Mario can move left or right to move the vehicle on the screen. You have to restart. Oh god, I don't know if I like this. There are a bunch of really fast ideas here. Whack-a-mole? No. It was slightly too big to send to Discord. How did I send it if it's too big? Course 14 is done and now we're working on Course 15. Train game? What's a train game? Is that... You lose. You already won space plus inside the arcade. I'm open to either one. Skidball? Oh my god, what is skidball? Oh, this kind of works with like a cannon. I can write them down. Wait, why is that internet loop? Holly, I need this as one file. Then I need the, I need the looping millisecond, basically, that would be the easiest way for me to do this. I mean, I can write on, um, CN ball with cannon shots, question mark. That would be fun for like a Yoshi coin. Let's try the internet loop in outer city and get it there. Okay. I will do that. I hope that works. Fuck was that sound? Okay. So we have two, seven, one nine, two, one, five, five, eight, eight, nine. All right, we're going to import it in a little bit. All right. I'm not sure about the audio, sir. Fun. Okay. I don't want to have weird mini games that you control with Mario. What the fuck was I thinking here? Oh, these all suck. These are terrible. Oh, claw machine. Yes. There was an idea for a claw machine that you have to dodge and an air hockey game that you have to dodge bowling, racing game in the seats, milk water game, ball into a rotated bucket. Yeah. All of these are very questionable. What's the idea you were talking about my back. So we have a main area. We have a game corner inside the casino building with like, Oh, I see. That was the plan. I mean, it's around almost 64 megabytes, a slight black hole to the end, Wacom old audio server, restaurant game, eat rats around the flipper pieces. I see. So the idea would be to have a flipper, but it's like very obviously hazards and not the thing to use. I'm like, no, not a casino and our Kate. See a lemon guy. See you. So I can delete these two. That's good to know. Yeah, we can do that. I like that. I think that looks very cool. We just, um, yeah. Um, where is it? I will notice that one for now. I like the concept of ads, just floating around. Yeah, that's a good point. That's a good comparison. I do like my sonic adventure. All right, let's set the low points. 7, 1, 9, 1, 2, 3, 2, 7, 0, 8. And then. Oh, 9, 8, 8, 4, 4, 8. This is how you do songs. Correct. 64. She'd use this method. Okay. Well, we can't just have things that sound cool. We also need to make sure that they play well. And I think that's going to be the more difficult part here. I ended up at the wrong level again. There's the song. Also interesting that accuracy, that inaccuracy in fast 64 is only recent, I just realized. All right, I will report that real quick. All right. All right. This looks so good. It's a very old level. This is significant. It means we have the entire game in C code instead of a sampling, which is very, very easy to read comparatively. So how big is the ROM now? 62 megabytes. And we still have these four songs to delete. Actually, I'm going to delete it right now. Ah, I computed the samples wrong. Oh, I know why. I know exactly what I did wrong. I took one minute as 100 seconds. All right, how big is our ROM? 58 megabytes. Oh, easy. We have so much space left and all the stream songs are in now. Oh, no problem at all. That means our actual game is like 30 megabytes. Not even. Songs that fuck up your PC when you play it. OK. We need the level to actually be fun. This is not fun. I don't like this. Hit the lights. I see. Spinning roulette for Yoshi. OK. This game machine. Oh, no. This game machine. Are we doing that? I'm going to turn on all the lights. All right. Yeah. Good. Which I'm still not done with, even though I moved out of there three years ago. At this point. Yeah, I use assembly sometimes. Yeah, I'm a bit worried that any of these are actually like gambling. I want them to be games and not gambling. That's kind of important to me. So. OK. Fun for games then I tried. I watch this whole stupid video by this idiot. Do you know how it was to watch this video? I am exhausted. Give me some credit man. OK. I'm in a workout routine. I'm in. It's right here. It's my workout routine. I do a light workout for 6 repetitions now. And then a heavy workout for 6. And today is. Wait I did 278 last time. And today is. This rest day here. So tomorrow it's back to heavy pull ups. With some calf raises and dips. Do I make the marbles fall off. And push. A prize out of the machine. Yeah that's kinda. This game here right. I don't know. Maybe this should be all the glory of casinos. With none of the gambling and games. Which the rocket is very cool for that. But the games we have here kinda suck. I mean whack-a-mole is cool. I like whack-a-mole. Space whack-a-mole. Asteroid sucks. Slide black hole. Slide to the end. I don't know if I want to slide anymore. Maybe the slide should be here. It should be your mode of getting around the level. So like slides everywhere. To get around the level. And then slide to the end is not a star anymore. Whack-a-mole is fun. Audio surf was a stupid idea. I don't want games you control in third person. Flipper pieces. I think I like the flipper pieces. As like. Their platforms you interact with. We are not doing pinball again. Okay we had two red coin pinballs. But the third one is gonna be good. This one is gonna be different. Once and for all. Ringtos game with the rings of Saturn. That's like playing handball to knock over bottles. How are you gonna use Mario to do that. Without it sucking. That's the big problem here. This one is going to be good. He is trying to discourage me. From following my dreams. My vision for this is different. Instead of being an actual pinball thing. Just like on a wall. It's gonna be a pinball 3D area. Instead of there being a thing to slide on. It's just gonna be the bumpers and the flippers. It's not actually gonna be a pinball game. Just like pinball elements. To use as platforms to get around. That sounds good right? This one is going to be great. I just know it. I have a new plan. I have a different vision for this one. This time it's gonna work. Slide down to the pinball. It's exactly what we don't want. What if instead of there being games inside. The tower in the middle. It's just a platforming gauntlet. To get to the top. Then there is a star on top of the casino. I think that works. It's just a platforming gauntlet. Yoshi coins will be easy to find here. Pixel art in space. I like it. It's just. With Mario Kart 64. Doing pixel art in space in Rainbow Road. I think we can't get around it. What if we merge this concept. With the concept of a Rainbow Road. What if someone is like. This is an arcade they built on top of the Rainbow Road. If you drive far enough down the Rainbow Road. You get to this arcade. What if that is the idea. This is a thing I was thinking. We should have low gravity areas. There would be some areas. Imagine there are green lines. Around the area. The green lines are slowly scrolling up. While you are in this area. You are in low gravity. Low gravity areas. Green lines are scrolling up. But I need to make this clear. Note blocks. Yes. No. Maybe.  Red coin star. One outside the arcade on moon rocks. We can have them be on moon rocks. I mean. We can write down moon rocks as platforms. I think that could look very cool. Imagine a moon that exploded. And the debris is still there. Is that what the idea was? Ok. Let's go. There we go. It's still there. I assume. Yeah. I can't get it right. Each has a different floor and there's one or two outside. Oh, I was thinking the majority of this level is outside. Each has a different floor. Wouldn't this be a lot of repeat walking the same path? I'm a bit worried about that. In my mind right now the level looks like a big rocket in the middle and then outside there's like slides and low gravity sections and rainbows flying around and asteroids. Can you explode the moon? I had this game written down as well for the arcade by the way. But I was thinking it would be kind of not fun to like control Mario like that. Like to use Mario to control a game like this. And it's also not fun to make the player just play a minigame. But the idea of the player exploding a moon is very cool. The fucking vision, wait, all right. I want to see this. I also like the black holes to get to like different parts of this. And I like the idea that this is like built on top of the rainbow road. But doing it on a rainbow road level, I don't know. I mean the giant casino going in and out of pinball machines and possibly mentioning arcade games as well. Not quite what I had in mind. I actually didn't really think about what the inside of the rocket would look like. I just figured we could use it somehow. I don't want this game to turn into W64 where it's like, oh you like 3D platformers? Fuck you. Here's Pac-Man. Go beat Pac-Man. Fucking idiot. You know what I mean. So So Is he not in her and arcade no gambling It's for little children I That's if all the platforms like the satellites the spinning planets the astronauts flying around He's all good. I Definitely should be using some of them And you think I seen on the moon true in less than that exactly though oh If we do an asteroids a game like that, we definitely make it look like Star Fox 64. I Hate the significantly less now, but I feel like that should be for you Imagine like an arcade machine sit down the camera just focuses on it and like a cutscene and now you control Star Fox 64 In a really really small version of Star Fox 64 where like you're just a plane and you can move left and right and shoot And you just go to the end for a Yoshi coin, I'll write it down Because I can't machine we are changed sit down I Don't have a car or a label now So for gambling money should exchange your money for tokens and wait to tokens to win tickets then exchange tickets or goods You know nothing like gambling true It's got nothing to do with gambling It's for fun money He met new people that like Monopoly, but you enter with real money I Want to see this people should be doing that play Monopoly for real money And like make it so that you can When you run out of money in the game, you can just add more money Why it's not a thing yet You know what the mobile Monopoly version is probably exactly that never mind this I misspoke There are some things I was like I would appreciate if this existed but I also feel like if this existed it would be used for evil I Not parading Eggman's announcement, but it's just you know, it's not a shitpost game I Don't know you can miss the whole thing I Never hit it on your green of time OST don't forget your planning a fun one in space What are that like super popular Nintendo games in the reference in the arcade machines for Yoshiko's I'm sure there's tons You Reach a window there's a lot of stride game on it It's a moon behind the window you can get off the little chip on the skin That's right. You're said and when you would explode someone behind it Wait A little asteroid game on it. There's a moon behind in the window You have a ship on the screen just right yes, I mean you knew it Okay, so you would be the ship here and there's an old 2d asteroid here and Exactly behind the 2d asteroid the 3d moon exists and then you destroy it and it explodes the real moon Yeah, that's kind of sick But can we make a star out of that horse is a Yoshi coin Like yeah, the visuals would be insane, but this feels so tiny. It's a Yoshi coin You do that and then you do red coins on it afterwards Hmm But you would have to do this inside, right No, I'm thinking you enter the arcade you do the game and then the moon outside the arcade exploded and then you go back out I think this works better You Enter the arcades you do the game makes sense We go into the rubble Yeah, I think this is easier if we just do it for a Yoshi coin than for an entire red coin You Or maybe we can turn this into a bigger star somehow What if there were more games like that that affected the outside Hmm Well, would that work? I'm gonna invest in this because this feels like a Really good mechanic that we can use for more than just one thing Hmm Yeah, it's a minigame that affects part of the level layout. I should do something with the low gravity somewhere. Because we have the low gravity platforming already. It's very cool. We should be doing that. There's also the possibility of using the blank holds I've programmed. To like separate areas. And I think we should do that. Just because it's gonna make the level feel a lot bigger. And we can make this less cramped. We definitely don't want to get the hang of it.    We don't want these areas here. These suck. But there has to be something with the black holes. Maybe you have to do something to unlock the black holes and then the black holes are platforming challenges somewhere. Power-ups is a good point. The power-ups should be usable here somehow. You can definitely get onto the big rocket ship. There's a star on top and that star has to be very visible. But we could add the cloud power-up or something somewhere. I think the cloud power-up would be good here. Yeah, I want that here. I think I might have to throw it in the cake machine to spawn a black hole that puts you in the game. But the idea of going into a game is kind of nice. I'm gonna note this down here. What about a game machine? Here you can teleport to the whack-a-mole and then there's the whack-a-mole area. With the black hole. So the idea would be that there are game machines you find in the main area and you jump into them and then you get into the game like that. I don't want to do it with an item though, but the idea of going into the arcade machine isn't good. I mentioned that. Is there one star in the game with the ice flower except on stage? Yes. You can skip feeding the dory in course four with the ice flower. Whack-a-mole is an entire stanza again. I'm wrong. Well, you have to find the machine first, right? So half the star would be getting to whack-a-mole and then the other half of the star would be whack-a-mole. At least that was my idea for it. And similarly, we can do other games that you would find. I just really like the idea that this is like placed on top of rainbow roads. I'm going to note it down, this is a full-on star and really fits with the space theme. It has few users, don't worry about it. Yeah, but there's other stuff, plus there's still the Yoshi stars. Cows running around, that's an easter egg. If it's like really far away, maybe, but eh. Jumping into a rhythm game. We can make a rhythm game. Imagine like a bunch of platforms aligned and there's like bowser shock waves coming out that electrocute you if you touch them, so you have to jump continually. 2D sections in the game doesn't work. Of course I can put 2D sections, but I don't want to. It feels like the opposite of what the design of this game nears. I mean, I can note down like rhythm game section, shock waves, electrocute you, blocks that are in one jump, arch, jump between blocks, between shocks, maybe we do that, I don't know. Apps are kind of underused in this game. I don't think they are used that much more rarely than in Mario 64. Which games have the cap? Bomb Battlefield has it. Bombs Fortress has one, but it doesn't count. Jolly Roger Bay has one, but I don't really want to count it. Glukkomiten has none. Big Boos Haunt has one. Lethal Lava, oh shit, Lethal Lava and all kinds of hazards. But we use it similarly to that. I don't think we're doing that much worse. Especially when the Yoshi stars come into play, I want the caps to be available for stuff. Don't worry about it, I think we'll get there. Plus we already have the cloud written down for here as a thing that maybe comes into play. A Street Fighter arcade game where you fight Wario? How is it gonna work? It sounds like it would very much not work. Rictorman, just punch him and ground pound him. Nah. I just don't like 2D Lord Calamari, like at all. While you're controlling Mario especially. No, I haven't played DOS Cream Teamer. I don't know, for me what I'm thinking about mainly right now is like the general vibe of the area. So we have our rocket and we have the stuff that's around it and that's nice and all. We have to flip us, that's gonna be around it somewhere too. And I think we can do like three sections around it. One is to flip us, one is the section to the game machine and then maybe one more somewhere. But I think what we really need to make this level feel more big is like ways to extend the main area. And I think that works best if either we somehow make use of the low gravity sections to like invent something cool or if we use the black holes to put the player further away. The Barney Rushford's demo hopefully comes out soon. Honestly, it's all dependent on how quickly the videos are being edited right now. Because there's two more videos I want to upload before that and then I can do the demo. So hopefully that's by the end of the year it's out. But no guarantee. Yeah, I think this is something.
