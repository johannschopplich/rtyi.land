All right for life is here hello Josia hello play man hello Zeina yes I just have to make them strike first first I've got a very difficult animation for Wiggler yeah you're gonna be busy all day with Wiggler today you should show off the cool little graffiti I made for the for the oily boy I can show that in a bit no one's here yet we're not showing up hello some guy I'm making tiny huge island time level I really wanted something like that we were theorycrafting something like that when we were making the new level ideas for the third overworld but we couldn't really think of anything decent like obviously I don't want a tiny and huge I wanted like ice and fire you know something like that obviously also not ice and fire but you get the idea let me export this what are you making Chris 11 hello TJ's any OST wishes today your team is not receiving enough data to do us a good stream how what the hell it's saying that my stream is bad great right so we were making an oil block here for the strike it's just as eating animation having a seizure right now and this is gonna be when I strike us so I have received some criticism about the forms which maybe we want to change how they look oh my god why do you mean why did you make them look like poop they're supposed to look and rusty it just looks like a brick of shit mm-hmm okay you know what I will make them a new texture you have no idea what the deck just look like you want oily and rusty right yes are you using the original texture no mr. small like what do you want this color what would be a good color here we could make them only a little dirty I can't do that too and then when you go into all the water you're just gonna fade out and respond with herself okay we listen to the Mario strikers charge blue yeah like something like this would probably be a little better because it's both blue and rusty yeah this would look pretty good but how is that gonna work because like look at the UV map here I guess I guess that works yeah yeah it's two textures I'll just send you two textures and then you can do what you want I might have to do that later okay I'll just change the old color and just the dirt Biobak hello hello goodbye my guy we still planning to do anything for the star select I still don't know what to do about it I feel like making 15 custom ones is a bit much I do have that Leila I think I'm just gonna make them a bit I like this I've also started making the oil block 3d model so I need you guys to like criticize it oh this is the extended OST this is not good oh this one to us I like this let me just get the first song this is the oil block what do you think I made his eyes white because when they were black you could barely see them I really like his teeth should his teeth be like maybe brown a little bit maybe it's it's a little out of place that you've got this dirty oil monster and he's got nice teeth yeah with the title screen I wouldn't mind making 50 mention when we can find title screen no I mean oh wait you mean the level title screen yeah it's really hard to come up with a good idea for those all right what do you think of the forms now now they like dirty I like this yeah maybe then being rusty doesn't make sense because they're out of stone you know I'm sure but the texture and texture was supposed to be permanent say no make this section I don't really like this what is this this is an environment yeah oh shit likes my believing to the thing here let me bring it back what the hell yes I agree with absolutely not I disagree yes but okay think about the other ones they have to head where they are vulnerable so the ones have their head on their back which makes a lot of sense but swamps are invulnerable they don't need hats you think bows I would spend money on a head on an enemy that's already invulnerable yes because he's that dumb no Bowser's a lot of things I am very much against them I think it would just not work besides then you couldn't plan for them anymore are you supposed to climb on these guys yes okay if that's the point then that makes sense I love how you put the little boxes the boxes there yes even the card boxes are angry with Bowser I'm gonna make them all jump in place it's kind of hard to tell their emotions maybe they should be like hopping up and down yes yes they will all be hopping out of them adding all look at this I don't wanna they're fine they're safe they're invulnerable no those are not all it stands for I guess I need a better texture it's only kind of like Bowser right now but yeah what do you think of this guy this is really who we're looking into right now obviously that's not a real animation in game colors are too intense mm-hmm that could be I can turn the colors down a little let me just find a texture that's gonna give me yes ain't I do this concept that for him after we had already freely a model time so he's probably gonna be a graffiti in the middle somewhere and this is this texture looks bad in motion oh this yeah I see what you mean I mean that's kind of how saturation down I guess I guess like this just so they understand I sent you a texture because that's the kind of oil texture I was going with yeah but I mean I can't see what he means by too intense like comparing these two yeah this looks like HSV values like the s is like maybe 150 you think it also needs to be darker that's probably saturation down first you're gonna run out of texture cash no Lily you're still mad at the the guy you were arguing with are doing it's this one here right okay I see what you mean some of these textures are really bright let's try this but there's no green on that oil spill picture yeah green is gonna exist in a situation like that but maybe it's like there I'm not sure actually it's actually fucked up do you guys think that the rainbow that we have on computers it's actually like a representation of evenly spaced waves I don't know about that oh he died yeah I think this is better all right please kill them you've never had a chance to live no it's the left can why is the roof of Wiggler on his chest if I may be so which one right here that's the root it looks like it look at the hierarchy that you know it's when you think on the bone and go into edit mode yeah relations yep that's the root why do you not name your bones boy the one without a parent is the root egg yeah it's clear why is it on his chest probably because all the other body parts have to follow that like that's where his origin is gonna be in game that's where he's gonna turn around it's gonna be very difficult to animate but I'll buy one makes us strong well firstly I can't really move him up and down properly I can't really move his chest and then I mean one of them is going to be unmovable just this one here what about the other bone there that's one I think you need to read I might and where do you want them to be just somewhere like in the middle so it makes sense I got his first body segment maybe not the first body segment but like somewhere in the middle body switch one I think the first body segment makes the most sense sorry and the first body makes the most sense I'll do that yeah it's this one here right now yes no it's this one see you can kind of see why that's a problem oh this one is oh it's for that segment I see yeah you're gonna be back to no animation but hopefully that works that is much better how's this better now you can't animate them at all anymore how are you gonna work with this yeah this doesn't work at all you want me to send you to a block all right I will send it to you by a block does he use the texture too or do you want the texture by back he says he has an idea okay all right I'll try I'll try animating the regular with the I mean I can make one change to this like you can try this we're gonna remove this one's parents okay I'll send you you might have to scale it down bio back but I will send you this all right have fun with it all right now you can like rotate this one like 20 degrees like this but you still can't do anything with this I think the break you have right now it's like the best thing we can do all right there's nothing I can change that makes us better profit I wish I get profit from sneezing I would sneeze all day long oh yeah let me show you guys what this level runs like on in 64 right now because I made a lot of improvements since last stream Found a lot of little things to improve. This game also seems a lot more consistent than N64 now. Hello Xeroclone. Fullscreen? Alright, fullscreen. Oh yeah, you guys also haven't seen the actual background screen yet. You see that? How good that looks? It looks so far away. But yeah, we actually get decent FPS now. Isn't that cool? Fine. So this is the worst part of the level, performance-wise. And I mean, 25 for the worst part of the level, in a level like this, I'm fine with that. For all the womps jump when you get in the render distance, I can show you what's happening. So there's like this pop-in thing. You see how when I go away from them, they do like that little animation. And then they pop back out of the ground to like hide the pop-in. Maybe it would look better with the Koopa here. Let me show you the pop-in on the Koopa. You see how he like smoothly scaled, and now when I come close, he comes back out of the ground. Why do the womps sound weird? I don't know. But yeah, I'm pretty happy performance-wise in this level. Like considering how big of a level it is to still get like 29 FPS, 27, fine. Fuck it, 27 is fine. There isn't really any culling right now. And the thing is, there isn't really any good thing to cull here. Because really what you need to cull is only what's visible in your laggiest camera setting. And that is only really the tower over there. That's the only thing that's being culled. Skybox texture?  I don't really know what I would put in there. But maybe something simple would work. Oh, you mean backface culling? Yeah, on N64 only, the backface culling on these things disables. Like you can't really tell that it's disabled, but if you look at the thing here, then backface culling turns itself on. But that looked bad on N64 anyway, with it off. Because it was just too noisy for how few pixels we have. What the fuck is this? I downgraded my PC, where I'm working on like a 1995 PC. And that's why my resolution is so low and my FPS is so low. I'm gonna try. Yeah, you're gonna enter the buildings later. I also just realized that one of these bombs still needs to go... This one here. He needs to go to the protest as well. I figured better. What is a RepEnet? NepEnet, that's what they're called. Look, if you google NepEnet, it's this guy. He's also known as CaprentorBlog, but that's what the fire version sounds like. What's down? I don't know. There? Down? I don't understand. I can't even read that comment, because the YouTube emoji thing is here. What the hell? I don't know. What's the direction? 0.2? 0.3? That's not a real direction. Look at that. That's not even close to a normalized vector. What, you think I would fall for that? Me? I don't know.  Truly innovative trick. Will it take up replayability? Hopefully. Imagine going to a game developer and saying, hey, is this game going to be good? Wait, this might be already all I need to do here. Oh wait, it's not. Can you show me the map origin, please? I can, but why do you want to see it? What the hell happened to his animation? He's got the savvy teeth. Wait, these guys are not jumping. That's not how this was supposed to go. Curiosity? The map origin is right there. Alright Inventor, are you ready to see the map origin? It's right here. There's nothing there. Oh, I need to set the BPM to 3. Okay. Is multiplayer still possible? Would be crazy. Yeah, I'm planning to add multiplayer after we have Quaternion animations. Unfortunately, I don't know how well it's going to run. I think the lowest it will run is like 20 FPS, which is still playable, I guess. But not very convenient. And something new once you complete it. Always feels nice to have new content. A game can be great without this. Hmm. I was not planning on adding anything to unlock. No new game plus. Just like... Like... You get better at Mario, you find new shortcuts that have replayability. God, these guys look really mad. But, where are the particles? You know what that means, multiplayer-specific navigation for every level. Well... Not entirely false. I'm not doing the custom thing, because of multiplayer. It would be too much work. That's the plan, better. I don't know if this happens with your genials, but sometimes new geometry I add won't be lit, so I have to set all colors in color. We go back to black. Huh. Okay, I like this. They're looking very angry. I think the Toxboxes should do this too. That's pretty good. These also need to squish me still. That's an issue right now.  Great minds think alike. You are very smart, because you had the same idea. I am very smart. That is so true. Taxi. Okay. Heh. Oh. I'm supposed to jump and rotate 90 degrees in a run. Oh, that's a really funny idea. Does it have to be 90 degrees though? Okay. Okay. Add some signs. Add some signs? Wait, what? Maybe it should work to add some funny, simple signs to them. Oh, to the protesters. Oh, I thought you meant like wooden sign boards. Yeah, yeah, that is a good idea, but I think it should be left to the talking characters. Like the bombs. And not only the bombs. And it should probably just be screw bolts. What do you think I was saying? I don't know. I thought they were bad word for a second. Okay. Thanks, Bowser. Basically, mission one, Mario runs around and causes a ruckus. Mission two, you knock off Bowser's statue's head. And mission three, everyone is striking and Bowser sends his strike breaker to stop the strike. But because you mess with them, they are angry at Bowser. They are like, this can't be. Dude, the Mario Strikers OST is a banger. Okay, guys, I had a crazy idea and I want you guys to tell me what you think about this. So this would be far in the future, maybe like two or three years from now. I was thinking we should develop like an Ocarina of Time hack. But instead of developing it like normally, we'll do it like a professional game studio. Like we'll just role play as like being a professional game studio. And there will be like people in different positions and everyone is allowed to just join the project. And we'll do it properly with GitHub and a QA team and all those things. I think it'd be very fun. As long as you pay like a game studio, wow. So the game will be bad? Hopefully not. Hmm. They were not really jumping. No, no, no, of course not. Cartridges will never be sold. So you guys think that's a terrible idea? You don't like that? No. Why are these guys not jumping? Okay. Oh. No, wait. It's a really fun gimmick and I'm sure there'd be enough people for it to at least pay for itself. I mean I think it'd be like a cool experience for everyone involved. That's the idea, the hope. Yeah. I mean wouldn't it be a huge legal issue? What would be a legal issue? Developing an Ocarina of Time like it's a game studio? I don't think so. Why would it be? Yeah, I need this here, I think. Oh, the cartridges, yeah, of course. That's why I'm not doing it, otherwise I definitely would. I might sell, like, OST cartridges with just the songs of RTYI. And I'm definitely gonna sell, like, boxes and instruction booklets and all that. Okay, I think this is kind of cool. The mistake was just too high, I couldn't create the jukebox menu itself, well, that would disincentivize buying the CD, the cartridge. Okay, I like this protest, it's very good looking. Oh, this is the first time we might actually run out of particle space, you see how they sometimes disappear early. Is in-game OST a lower sample rate, uh, yes. Yeah, that is the one issue with it, you know. I would have to look into whether it's legal to, like, sell the OST if it has a few samples that are also used in Mario 64, or if I can maybe legally, like, get the rights to use the samples. Because I think Nintendo just bought the samples from somewhere, I might be able to buy them from the same place. Oh, that would be very good. Spikes and jumps are small. Yeah, fair, let's use a smaller one. I guess we don't have the particle threshold. Everyone's on that already, yeah. When Yoshi is probably trademarked, all the characters are trademarked, you're gonna have to make a box with no name and no characters. The design requirements are going to be pretty specific, but I think we can manage. Yeah, exactly, we could just refer to it as R2-D2. It was registered on March 18th, 2022 as a trademark. What? The term Yoshi. Uh-huh. Yeah, I would definitely ask a lawyer beforehand. But that's in the future anyway. Right now we care about making the protest look good, and this looks fine. How's the weekly animation? I'm working on just trying to get a good walk cycle going on. So I'm doing it one segment at a time so it doesn't just fry my brain cells. But I think, you know what, I'm just gonna take a video of this. I don't think my system supports spawning them further away. I like the opacity speed. So now it's time for it to look like a protest. We can go with signs. I can make some signs. Let's see. Okay, the question is, do we just put the signs up somewhere, or do we attach them to the character models? Because if we attach them to the character models, it's gonna make a few things more  And then also the question is, who do we give the signs to? Definitely the Koopas. Maybe one or two of the Thwomps. I saw that, yeah, Stoke. Remove the screen shake? I like the screen shake. I'm not removing it. Fuck you. I think the shake is fine. If you're in this area with a protest, you can have a bit of screen shake. When you're protesting, the Unfair Work Conditions Poser puts them in. That Mario put them in. Alright, that's what I have for the walk so far. I need some feedback on it, if anybody wants to give it a go. Let's see this. I'm only animating the front part first. I'm just focusing on the legs. It looks like he's going through mud, because the part backwards is so much slower than the part forwards. What do you mean? It's like going fast, and then fast, and then he's going... Ah, I see. Like he's having serious issues just hitting off the ground. I see, I see. One of the Thwomps should definitely have a diode or an OG King Troll. Why is the left leg moving like what, Lula? I don't know. Yeah, we're going to add Koopa animations, but this is going to be in the animation and not in the object position. Because they're rigs. I'm up for giving one of these dialogue about... the walking. Yeah, I can see that, Lula. I kind of really only want to give one of these a sign, though. Like one of these species. And I think it should be Koopas. Because Koopas seem like the only intelligent ones out of these. Intelligent enough to do this. Yeah, some of these are fixed better. I fixed them like two or three weeks ago. Yeah. Alright, let's distribute dialogues here. We have... 1, 2, 3, 4... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Thwomps and 3 Koopas and 1 Goomba. Okay. 10 dialogues in total. It makes me so mad. We built his houses, his castles, we paid his roads and still he walks all over us. Does he even pay us? No! You saw 7? The hell? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 I'm being gaslit. I don't wanna make a Marty. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 unstoppable It's like you need it twice. You're way too hung up on that guy. Why do you even care? Let's see... This is the text I want. Nope, there's no limit. I mean, at some point your ROM size is just maxed out, but that's it. It makes me so mad. We built his houses, his castles, paved his roads, and still he walks all over us. Does he even pay us? No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Okay, that's a nice five liner. What more do we want? Actually, let me distribute these texts as well. 92 93 Striking Koopa? No, not yet. Nope.  Nope. It's the Toad song. Nope. I have definitely messed up. That is way too many. I just put in a hundred. How? This is actually after this Koopa. Is this extended? No, the last line is a separate one on purpose. It's like the punchline. 92, okay. 93, good. Nothing.  Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. 95, this one's good too. Swamp Worker. Yeah, we don't want him. So 96 is free. Go to 96. 97 This one's not supposed to have one. And this one's 98. Okay, there we go. Wait, this doesn't make any sense either. I still have one too much. What? Did I do something stupid? The first one is 92. The last one should be 97. I must have given text out twice. You care because he thinks he's right. That's the internet for you. What? Dude, what if the guy was right and there are seven prompts and I just... I'm bad at counting. I'm gonna go back and count. What the fuck? What? See, my theory was that the guy is not a real human. I think he's an NPC. He just uses words in the plane of words instead of in the plane of meaning. So when he says things, they don't actually mean anything. There's only six. One, two, three, four, five, six. One Two Two Oh, wait. One Two Three Four Five Six Does one of them have the wrong B prompts, maybe? What is wrong with me? What if I missed a number somewhere? 98, 97, 96 95 I missed 94. There we go. Okay, all the wrong texts are distributed. That is a very hot take and people would hate you for saying that out loud in some places. Romhacking.com But I agree. Alright, all texts are distributed. Let's think of some funny dialogue. Do we use chitchipity? Let's use chitchipity. I don't think I should show my chitchipity user here. Just to be safe. Because it is work stuff. I am making a level where Bowsa's minions are striking against Bowsa. They are working on the soil rig and are fed up with the working conditions. Give me five short dialogues that the worker wants to say. Let's see what it has. You've been getting swished for years and for what? Minimum coins and no bricks? I've got cracks I didn't even know about. It's time Bowsa learned to appreciate our hard work. And with the thorns at the castle saying they can get weekends off, why can't we get the same? It's important to defend our Bowsa fortress now, just another brick in his oil machine. That's a good one. It's a good old days just got in the castle, but this oil rig is crushing us and not in a good way. Crushing is such a good pun too. It has good ideas though. No, I know what you mean, but the ideas are good. They're making jokes about crushing is perfect. You could say this labor is soul crushing or this labor is crushing me. I thought Mario was the enemy, but what's really been crushing me is this labor. Something like that, you know what I mean? Regenerate? No, I'm using the crushing pun. This environment is crushing, and believe me, I know a thing or two about- Yeah, exactly! See? This environment is crushing, and believe me, I know a thing or two about crushing. Let's see, I've got cracks I didn't even know about, it's time Bowser learned to appreciate our hard work. That's also kind of funny. Minimum coins and no breaks, eh? Not really. Let's see, what more can we give to GPT for context? They all are wearing protective gear and are gathered in a square, give me 5 more ideas. The more context we give it, the more opportunity it has to latch onto the funny. Look at us, stacked out in gear and still in respect, Bowser wouldn't last a day in our shoes, eh? Remember when we were told to- No, no. Sorry. Okay, don't reference the ear so much, just give me a few funny bugs. I think I should have a Sinus that's working here as hell, but the shell is kind of differently. Let us see, LMAO. Alright, I'll let you see. Remember when our biggest worry was Mario stepping on us good times? Who knew Bowser's real superpower is turbo management? I applied for a position as a doorstep after this, less stressful. I think I'm using that one. How much better is 4.3.5? I never use 3.5. I don't know, I just never used it. What else? There is a bit of context to this. Before they protested, someone's been messing with the equipment and making the work impossible. Generate some noise. Someone said the wrenches went missing, but they're on the beach somewhere sipping oil cocktails. What? I've always wanted to lay down on this job, just not like this. I like number three. Someone's trying to bring my operation, it's not even catchy. I don't get it. There's no drill though, so it doesn't make any sense. A lot of these I don't get. I mean, we have three good ones already. I'm sure we can think of three ones without JGPT. I'm applying this more here. I don't accept drills. Yeah, still. I mean, there are drills in this as well, don't worry about it. I don't get it. I'm worrying. Oh no. What more context do we have in the level that we could provide JGPT to make jokes out of? Maybe the other characters. They are protesting together with Koopas, Worms and Togs. Each type of worker. I mean. As Worms and Thwomps used to compete along with Squish, Mario first. Now we're trying to squash this workplace mess. When I drop, it's usually on intruders, but I'm ready to drop these poor conditions too. Toyboys instead of Togs boxes. It's just kicked the wrong key. Yeah, I did tell it's an aurora. I can't believe Kaze is using JGPT instead of hiring writers. He is ruining this industry. Maybe it does. I don't know. Probably not. All of these are like too long setup-wise. They're not quick into the punch. Do you know what I mean? Lost my shell at work today. That's the last straw. Maybe I just ask for more if they have good ideas. Oh, nice. There's gonna be more soon, I hope. Maybe later if I have an idea. We're more than just a stepping stone. Squished at work, squished by Mario, enough. Brick by brick, we'll break the system. We're solid, but our patience isn't. I'm not just a blockhead, I've got feelings too. Built up, but tired of being taken for granite. That's kind of a good one. I want this one. You can't just replace it, Leyla. You don't need to translate it. If you translate this into a different language, just use your own pun. It's not like this is an important text. I mean, we might have to go with a lower quality one like this one as well. Just because we don't have any more ideas. And there are six characters. Let's do this. Ten more. Hmm. Can I have this one? Yes, yes, yes, I can. Let's see. These are the ones I've liked so far. Let's make more like this. It might just give it to me in R64 format. Oh my god, it understood the format. They say I've made the wrong button. It must have been a pothole I missed fixing. Bowser's promise is flatter than I am after Mario is done. Compounding is my game, but this stops the real pain in the asphalt. We can do that. I'm making a protest out of wumps in my Mario 64 suit. They need to protest against Bowser's poor work conditions and some mess happening. Give me other text like this. Did it just try to make an asphalt joke? Yes, it did. The pain in the asphalt. I like that, I want to say. Honestly, I think pain in the asphalt is just too good to not go. I'll go with pain in the asphalt. Fuck it. It seems to have understood the assignment, too. That's crazy. Wait, did it not? Or did it? Where is it wrong? Okay. Shit. It's too mature. Pain in the asphalt? No one's gonna... A little kid's gonna look at that and be like, oh, haha, asphalt. That's a brick thing. I don't think it's mature. It's not too much. Okay, but why won't this compile? Okay. What was that sound? I remember being as good at laughing at shit-talking mushrooms. Nintendo has done worse than that, yeah. What is going on? How is this wrong? Am I blind? Does anyone else see this?  Slash after slash in? Oh. Alright, let's go visit other wumps, see how it works out. Okay. The moment is crushing and leaving. Okay, wait, so it's too long. And I misspelled it, too. Cool. I really need to lower the draw distance here. But this house, this castle is prepared to rot and suddenly walks all over us. Let's see, ever play this? No.  Applying for a position as a doorstop after this, less stressful. I'm going to my game, but this job's a real pain in the asphalt. We're more than just a stepping stone. I'm built up, but tired of being taken for granted. Yeah, most of these work really well. You could probably reuse the stomping animation from the guy in the cement pit with some of the koopas. I could, but I don't think it's ideal. Okay. I should look at when they're working on the wump size. Oh yeah, I think he's supposed to. Why doesn't he? Let me check. Ah, this is why. You don't have any goombas in there, do you? There's one goomba. Is he the one that's going to be flattened? That's the one that got flattened. Yeah. We should have him be flat here. I think that'd be really funny. Not the collision. Where? What are you on about? What did I miss? Why is the thwomp's texture so gritty? Isn't that just a normal thwomp texture? Tell about it when you touch the thwomp's edge. That's because it's a dialogue box. That's just how they work. Yeah. I think this is fun as fuck. He's still flat, because he got fucked from Mario. Still doesn't really look up. I made it too tall. I guess it should be like 250. Oh. Why did I make it that big? The highest tier is 344. This one's a banger. I think this is the Waluigi song. I don't know. Alright, next we have to do the Koopas. We can ask Genji PT again. Unless someone already has a banger idea. Oh, I also need to set the dialogue's sounds. Starts at 348. Will my chat freeze again? Always confuse Worms with Worms. Yeah, they're very easy to confuse. You think spinning in the shell is dizzying? I gave him a lot of exchanges. All of these kind of suck. I don't like any of these. Hello Nintendo for life. I did hand these out already. Okay, the Goomba's definitely going to complain about being flat. What is that noise? My wife's going to leave me. A rolling thwomp? No, I will not. I might also want to think about a background texture actually. I don't know what I'm going to do yet. But something would be nice. Maybe like some clouds in the far distance. I don't know if that would look good though. My kids won't recognize me. I won't fit into my new car. There should be some kind of practical implication of this. At the divorce line? The divorce line's funny, but it's also too sad. I think the divorce line could be really good. What does it say for the divorce line? It would just be like, my wife's going to leave me. I got flat into a pancake, my wife's going to leave me. That is cruel. Imagine the face of my wife when I slide under the front door tonight. Yes, that's the perfect one. Would you leave me if I got flattened into a pancake? Would you leave me if I got flattened into a pancake? I think that's a yes. She's not responding. She's not responding. I wasn't paying attention, I'm sorry. It's okay, we get it. What do you mean? My wife left me a cake bomb. From pancake to pancake. From pancake to pancake. Are you saying you're going to get flat? Yes. What would you do if I got flat like this? I would be very concerned. I'd probably just take you to the hospital. Damn. Damn. Alright, just the three Koopas now. The Goomba was easy, but the Koopas are hard. Is the Goomba that's flat the only Goomba in the protest? Yeah. Okay, so he doesn't really need much of an animation. Yeah, especially because he's so flat. But the Goomba also needs his normal animation still. Like a hop and a walk? No, like him sitting. I have him sitting. I don't have that animation. Yeah, I have him sitting. There's one where he just falls, gets up, and just hops up before he goes flat. Okay, that's perfect, that's all we need. Yeah, I was in the midst of doing a little hopping protest animation. Yeah, that would also be good. Yeah. If you don't use it, you don't use it, but it's there if you want it. Would you love me if I was a pancake? True, the biggest question. I don't know, if you were a pancake... You would eat me. I would leave you? You would eat me. Yes, I would eat you. I just put a dollop of maple syrup. And there you go, I have a tasty snack. These are not very funny. Make some funny ones. Boza wouldn't last a day in my shell. Oh, yes, that's a really good one. Yes, Leela, I am indeed Canadian. It's not like I was born here. Boza wouldn't last a day in my shell. Yes. It's just gonna fade you out and then respawn you with less health. Boza said I'd be a blockster, but all I got was a backscar. I thought Boza needed support to get me a pair of shoes. I'm working day and night for him and he isn't even able to shell out a few coins for us. Yeah, I like that. Hey, now they're just making puns! Hey, Mario, ever heard of the Worms' new gig? They're forming a band, call it Rock and Roll. Huh? You have, Arlo. We're writing funny text right now. Aren't you a funny guy? I am hard at work. Yeah, Biobak's giving us better answers than GenGBD. Biobak's just naturally good at coming up with phrases. Mario, guess what? The Worms started a union in Boza's build, as they call it. They're not blocking. Nope. No, the Koopas are protesting against Boza. They are part of the protest. Goddammit. They're gonna replace all the writers with Biobak. They're all gonna be jobless. Mario, we're on strike 2. Boza promised shells with spikes. And what do we get? These flimsy regular ones. It's kind of funny, but no. He expects us to chase you all days with these feet. I've got blisters, Mario, blisters! I just copy-pasted some stuff and I just decided to use it, Arthur. Oh, that's a good one. That is a good one. I'll use the Koopa with Koop line.  I could be on Koopa with Koop sipping on cocktail right now. The Bowser had to make us work on Festival Day. Yeah, I would be pissed off too. Maybe there should be a line about Koopa with Koop line. About one of them being demanded he show up for work when he had a day off. Eh, no. No? These guys have bigger concerns. And we already have all the texts. Sometimes it's wrong, it's better to have the original message be more specific. Maybe, but I was having a conversation with it. Alright, let's see. I guess I can move to the next line. This guy is my favorite. Got flattened to a pancake. Imagine the face of my wife when I slide under the front door tonight. ... ... ...  ... ... ...  ... ...  Wait, so is this the part where we actually go into the office building? No, this is where you fight the boss. Okay. I think I'll make it so that you can actually just go into the office building from the get-go. But we still need to make the inside of it. Maybe there should be an animation for when he's in the office during the protest where he's kind of just frustrated about the protest and the fact that he lost to Mario again. Yeah, he's going to be frustrated in all of the acts. Maybe every time you go there he's a different text. ... ...   Wait, this is so funny. You just got a very funny idea. And I will squish too. Bowser didn't even cover my medical bills. Let's see if I can squish the dialogue. I think I can. Let me just think of a good way to do it. ... ... The Goomba dialogue box was squished too. ... Let's see. How can I squish the Goomba dialogue box? What is the optimal way to do this? ... ... ...  ...  It's not like processing matters here at all. I can just do something birdy. It wouldn't be a big deal. ... ... ...   ... ...  ...   ... ... ... ...    Don't I have an idea here? There's a whole unused struct to the dialogue entry. ... Can I set this somehow? ...  ...    The first one is always 1.  ... ...     ... That is kind of really cool that we can do that ... Took a bit Let's see if this works, and if it does work then we're gonna rename that field into like special effects What's wrong? Too few arguments in function call 647 Oh Do you like the idea? What idea? You should totally have a drybone cooper here Like I feel inside one of these machines I suppose I didn't even cover my medical bills ... That would be really funny, yes I don't know if I wanna make a whole drybones model though Just for the gag Hmm The dialog box is squished but the text is not ...  Can I just ... Do this here I should be able to just have kev1 matrix in front of all of this, right? ... SpongeConqueror is here? Where? Who's that? I feel like I'm not up to date on the lore here ... ... Isn't this how you do this? I don't know, might work. I know that Spongebob is like a funny little kid that's like complaining about people not liking Spongebob or something, but that's all I know and I know he's like very incomprehensible. Hello cocky death, my death. Hey, we get the flat text, all right, it works. I think it's too flat though, it's like unreadable. I'm gonna make him a bit less flat as well so you can see his animation. I don't want to surgically transform myself into Mario, I don't want to be like 4'10". It's too small, isn't it? I didn't mean for it to be so small. Let's see how this looks. Dude, that's actually fucked up, there is a person on the planet that is the worst Mario 64 player out of every single one, like that person exists and I want to know who that is. Wait, now it works like that? Maybe I'm just doing it wrong, let me remove this again. Would they not just be someone, well it would be someone who's never played it, but I would also, there's many people that have never played, so there's like one person out there that has like the lowest skill floor in all of Mario 64 and they are probably so goddamn awful. Works. There's a person on this planet, yes, that too. People who have never played Mario 64 were better than the worst player, definitely. Who's the best Mario 64 player that has never played Mario 64? No, and I'm not gonna add a shoutout to Sip of Lips. Do you think I am cringe? I think just adding random memes to your hacks is just cringe. Unless it's specifically a meme hack, you should not do it. Alright, so the next step here is to initiate the boss fight. Basically what's gonna happen is you're gonna go into this area here and Bowser's gonna send a strike breaker and he has to somehow just gulp you up and it should only happen on Act 3. So how do we best insinuate this? I was thinking he would just come and he would just eat you and then he'd just go underground with you and there'd be a separate area. Should this just be a cutscene? It's a really good concept. Alright, I wanted to use him again for the second Bowser boss. I don't know if I can use him for all bosses. But I was gonna use him for all the main bosses. I think I will add him to the second Bowser. I'm gonna make a note here before I forget it. King of the Goombas, Goomboss, but there's so many bosses and most of them don't even have a cutscene. No, there's not a boss in every main world, but like every other one. I mean, we can go over this real quick. Running Rushwoods. Yes, there is a boss. Here is a boss. This one has a boss. This one has a boss. This one does not, so 4 out of 5. This one doesn't have one, 4 out of 6. This one has one, 5 out of 7. No, 5 out of 8. No, 5 out of 9. This one does, 6 out of 10. And this one has one too, so 7 out of 11 bosses. Anyway, let me just see here how it would be good to incinerate this. Also, I gotta make it so that this hat here disappears after the second act. Hello on your night long place. How long have I been working this? Maybe like 2 and a half years. Something like that. Maybe a bit longer. I don't know. So what's gonna happen is you're gonna go there to these minions. I wonder if anyone's actually gonna use this thing for its intended purpose. It sucks getting over there like that. The question is, when should the cutscene trigger for the boss? Because you might want to talk to these people. Should he go inside of Bowser's house? Or inside his office here? Can I speech bubble or something similar? Mmm... Yeah, I don't think it's needed. Talk to 3 of them. But the thing is, you can already talk to them on act 2. And there's not gonna be a boss fight on act 2. So you might just not even have a reason to talk to them anymore. It's just an empty platform. Doesn't matter. I don't think it's very disturbing. I don't think it's too obvious that this is a portal place. Try to go into the house and the bridge flips you back. Mmm... Mmm... At least I'm definitely gonna go inside here. This is supposed to be Bowser's office space. So something has to happen inside, I think. I'm not even really sure what we're gonna make this look like inside. Is it just gonna be a small tower that you climb and then there's Bowser at the top? Maybe a cave? It's supposed to be like an office building. You're supposed to go up to Bowser's room and hear Bowser talk about how annoying everything is. So we could make it so that as soon as you touch the bridge here, the cutscene starts and the block just eats you up. But I feel like... No, I feel like there needs to be more. What if Bowser is just outside this time? Actually, we can't have Bowser here. That's too bad performance-wise. The problem with having to be on the bridge is you can just skip the bridge. Hello, Sayo. Now we won't have anyone to talk to. I can't be triggered by a dialogue because you can talk to these all beforehand. The thing is we haven't done anything inside Bowser's building yet. So we have full reign to design this to work well with the mission. I think ideally the player would want to enter the area again. Because in the previous act, you knock the head of the Bowser statue off, it makes a lot of sense to be like, Hey, let's go inside and see how Bowser is reacting. On the first act, he's gonna be like, Man, that Mario, he destroyed my fleet. I'm so upset. On the second act, he's gonna be like, Man, all the work is being screwed over. I'm so upset. On the third act, he's gonna be talking about, Oh my god, they knocked the head of my statue off. I am sick of this. I am done. Oh yeah, yes, yes, that's perfect. Okay, look. Act 1, he's complaining. Act 2, he's complaining. Act 3, there's like a cutscene. You enter there, and he's gonna be really, really upset. He's gonna be in a stomping tantrum. And he's gonna talk about how he's gonna send a strike breaker. He's sick of all these workers. And then you come back out. Come back out to the plaza. All those guys were here before. And the plaza's empty. No one's there anymore. They're all gone. And then you walk out. And as soon as you're in this area, anywhere here, the black comes out and he just eats you. And brings you to the boss fight area. So the second you leave this tower, you're gonna be like, Oh shit, where's everyone? And we're gonna remove the background music as well. It's gonna be like, Oh my god, something changed. So you come out and then it starts. That's perfect. That is what I'll do. Let me just note all of that down.  Enter Bowser's building. Go to Bowser and you hear him complain and send a strike breaker. As soon as you leave Bowser's tower, everyone is gone and the music has gone quiet. As soon as you walk up to... There we go. And when you enter the warp, the other door closes on you and you go up. Yeah, that sounds about right. Actually, it should be almost like that. Hmm. Definitely, I like the idea of an elevator. But I want there to be a Yoshi coin in here as well. So there needs to be a secret somewhere. So it should be like a long thing with an elevator going up. And then at the very top, there is like Bowser's office. You're gonna... Let me just draw this out real quick. Paint. Okay. Paint. We have an entrance hall here and there's gonna be an elevator here. The elevator is the red area. This is like a door that you enter. Let me put this to the bottom of the document. And then it's gonna go up. And you're gonna come out at an area that kind of looks like this. And Bowser is here. And like right here is a window that you can look through. And then right here, there's like a closed off door. That you can't enter. Closed door. Window. And the entrance here is like here. So you'd walk up to the window to hear Bowser complain. I tried to have a good mix of story based and exploring osu!com. With a sleeping Shy Guy at the counter. Yeah, there should be a counter here of just a guy sleeping. Let's add that. Hmm. Reception. Guy sleeps. Yeah, you wouldn't actually talk to Bowser. You would just like listen in on him complaining. Okay. He's just dreaming of it. Okay, so the one thing I want to change about this is that I want there to be a secret. Something you can do to get a Yoshi coin. I think it'd be kind of cool. Hmm. Now he's not going to protest, he just sleeps. Waking up the receptionist Yeah, or like Cooper Go into events. Yeah Okay, one cool thing One thing that'd be really cool Is if there was like a hole right here and you could go into it to the extent here and get a coin So you'd find like a secret window to go out of You think that would work The only thing about that is that we need some kind of way to actually get there. Oh, it could just be wall kicks No, you could just walk kick in the entrance hall here and get to the window like that The toilet at the top of the building you mean Thank you, okay I semi like the the wall kick thing I was hoping that'd be a bit more mystery to it. I Don't like the idea of event that you enter but the problem with event is that the camera is gonna be shit You get it up off the tower at some point no the thing is the top of the tower is not really supported We kind of have a huge performance issue here. So I don't want to support the top of the tower being visible This is not high poly, this is like 20 polygons, 22 Maybe like Wait, what CWC is that you did the acronym for Koopa Wave Cove? It does make a performance difference, but there's also the back No, I just want us to be simple plus it's also if you're on top of this the background is not gonna look good anymore I just don't want the player to get there. The only higher place that supports this is gonna be in the middle of the level You're not gonna find Bowser here This is the highest place I want the player to go so I like the idea of going out of a window here But there should be a secret second floor. You know what I mean? Like the lobby Then the top floor and then like a halfway up floor that is secret Then you can only get in if you do some special shit Yeah, what does that change It doesn't feel useless to me you're the only one saying this is useless This is connecting the whole level It's having a reason for it to be there. Oh, you don't like the theming of it Now that makes more sense I mean this was originally intended to be the blimp landing place where Bowser would land his blimps But I couldn't find a good landing place texture So I ended up not doing that I The circle needs a reason I'm in an app for changing this area. Either way. I want to think about the mystery here. It could be the mystery of Bowser's Tower We could make it so that you somehow escape the elevator while it's going up Maybe there's like a secret action you can do it to make it get stuck and then you can get out or we can make it so that you can walk out of the top of the elevator and Like ledge onto the window I mentioned the elevator is just like a box but no top and then you do wall kicks and you like it up And then maybe you go through an air vent Starts when you get on but if you get out fast enough at least without you and you can end that shaft and wall kick Oh That is a cool idea Okay All right, let me know that done elevator Elevator Exit And Then we need to make like a shaft And From We can still just make up platforms for this as we go This game is a single NFT copy so we have to brain that whoever gets it will share no for me. Thanks true You Yeah, this is gonna be super cool let's add a little window to this then that you can actually get out It's only gonna be one window you can actually get out of which will be like the air shaft And the others maybe like decal buildings and windows Ah There we go, thank you blender very cool I I Wait when he said it everywhere You All right, let's undo that because that's not at all what I want Shit I can't I have to go with this great lovely Oh Group mopping it's been a while since you're a sucker. I thought you were sick I Think this works for the exits Thanks, I think it's worth it to insert and Action the red parts of the texture and what's for some depth? I Don't know what you mean Being sold for $80 $80 video games doesn't seem that outrageous to me If you think about it video games have gotten cheaper since in 1995. How much was Mari 64 back then? How much inflation since 1995 $100 then it's like 185 today. So like 16 of that 1.85 Mari 64 released now would be a hundred eleven dollars And so that's the option okay, so Yeah, but what? You want me to inset and extrude it? What the fuck is the point of that? Oh You want to insert this like all of them Or you mean like the outside here The outside of a book good. Yes But you mean insert the dark proud And Something like that just good it would look a lot better, but I don't know if that's worth it It's 60 bucks what Damn man was lying Well I'm gonna pirate any game. I want like obviously why would I pay for something? That's free It's what I would say if I was a bad person. I would never actually do that. That's what I would say. I was a bad person I Yeah, but like if you it's probably 60 if you live in the United States we live in Canada we pay the 80 What your parents say ahead on time for example Okay, the thing is I actually wouldn't because when I started working there they gave me the game for free So I wouldn't need to I See what a bad person would think is that if something is freely reproducible and you're reproducing it for free Then it doesn't really matter But you know, that's just what bad people think Bad people they seem to think that It's kind of weird to gate keep something with money. Like if you could just give it out for free That's like weird Just because it's not a necessity I don't know I Think it's bad people think it's just a bad business model It looks like lighting isn't being a pleasure as well You can always paint every vertex black in the colors you built and we sent it to you in color Yeah, but it doesn't look like the light is in the plates Where you taking this from I Mean just say what you said, so Nice pin every vertex black in the college. Yeah. Hey what I don't want that what that would ruin all my vertex colors Huh I don't want to lose my product scanner Selena. What are you on about? Okay, let's add a few windows to this building and I think we are done with it I You sound like you're doing crazy talk right now, oh, yeah, we get new textures we got worms textures. It's pretty cool But now I'm basically I would never pirate basically every VM they just somehow appeared on the USB stick that's actually possible Because of quantum tunneling and astral ray bit flips Technically it could happen that every single bit on your USB stick through pure radiation from the Sun Just happens to flip to represent almost every weekend The same thing happened to me You Dude it's not my fault. It's astral ray bit flips I don't think any of these windows really work. Hmm. Let's look at Bowser castles. Let's see if there's any art on Bowser's office. Look, it's a Bowser's office. Ha he just has windows like this. Nothing special. Your honor, Asheray bitflipped the tweet saying I wanted to kill the president onto my computer. I mean, it's not beyond reasonable doubt, you know, I think that is perfectly justified if that's your defense. Dude, I would make such a good lawyer. Do I maybe have something for windows? I don't think so. I can literally steal these. Literally asked for Ray bitflipped this model onto my computer. Lawyer pays more than my current job. I have no idea how much lawyer pays. I guess that depends on how much of a soul you have.  I have the tab open, but I didn't actually download it yet. I'm still planning to. Castle of Dark Illusions. That's what the card looks like. That's fucked up. That's not even a castle. Alright, let's try this model. Wait. Oh shit, this is Daisy's song. I know this one. Dude, when I was working on OnlyUp64, I almost paid for WinRAR. What would you pay for WinRAR? I had to open so many zip files. I don't think any of these work. This isn't really the good window here. Just use 7-zip. Oh. What the hell? Oh, I see. You guys think this would make a good texture? I think it would work. Easily recreate it. What do you need it for? The bullseye office here. You want it in that shape? Yeah. Okay, hang on. I'm going to try this, and you can try yours. Wait, that was Peach? I thought that was Daisy. Which one's this? No, this is Peach. What the fuck? Where's Daisy? Daisy comes in two minutes. Alright. I mean, yeah, now that you're saying it, it makes sense that this is Peach. Dude, I played this game so much, though. Like, crazy that I didn't know that. And crazy that you knew that. I literally, I keep telling the story, I literally won the European Championship for this game twice. I'm a fucking pro gamer. But you know, the championships are like once a week, so it's not really that special. But I only tried twice. So really, kind of a good record. I know this is Yoshi, yeah? How to manage difficulty considering my experience? Playtests. You can also just play on N64 with 500 milliseconds of lag, and it kind of helps you gauge difficulty. There are some things Photoshop can't do, so I have to use GIMP. Oh, yeah, this is Daisy. Of course. I used to main Daisy in this game, because I think she has the best special. Fix AV? What's wrong? The window looks weirdly flat. How many polys in the scene? Like 5,000. And on the left side, you mean these two here? I don't know if it's better to extrude them. Looks like no difference to me. I don't know if it's better to extrude them. I don't know if it's better to extrude them. I don't like the placement of these. No, this is bad. That placement makes no sense. Maybe like that? I turn into Wario when I'm on the toilet. I don't think it looks as bad as I thought it would. Rip. The Canadian toilets can still not handle it, yes. Yeah, I like it. I think the windows are good. I think maybe the actual window color can be different, but the placement is fine. Like that. And then the red is not good. You know what the Zonai are called in French? In German, they're called Zonau. So I'm guessing in French, they're called like Zonau? Something like that. I can't even tell if you're trolling me. I made some angry eyes for the Krippa earlier too. Oh nice. I'm gonna need them in a bit. I have two different versions of the angry Koopas. I wonder if maybe we can overwrite a few of our texture formats to be CI8 to save a bit of processing here. Like that would be cool. Oh, I guess most of these are already CI8. CI4. I8, I8, I8, I4, I8 and I8. CI4? Damn. The texture formats are already really, really good. Oh, I guess that idea. You're not, that's actually the name. Damn. I predicted French. I am writing the script. I rolled the nickels. Was the statue bad though? What do you really want me to change about this though? I kind of like how it looks. Okay, the hat has a different color than the rest. That's a bit weird. I think that's because we changed the world lighting. Yeah, it's because the actual vertex lighting we used is red and the world lighting is not. That's a pretty easy fix though. I think. A better texture. The texture looks perfect to me. I changed the lighting like two days ago. I don't know what you see wrong with that. Sorry, I'm using Sphera in the bad way. Can't you simply record? Actually possible. Death Wizard has done that. But I think that's throwing up whole new performance concerns. It's probably not that much performance actually. But still. Yes, I was thinking of making it so that on the emulator the hat unstretches. Alright, well the next step is going to be making the inside of Bowser's Tower. But I think for the stream today we have done enough. I'm really happy with the plan now. So we're going to continue working on this next time. That's too bad, I sent over some finished animations. Oh, I have to look at this? Alright, let's look at the Goomba builder first. Let's look at them real quick before we leave. Right here. So I made him a new walk cycle. Okay, well he doesn't walk. No, but it's there if you want it. Alright. That's just him sitting and chilling. He's just having a good time. He's having the time of his life on his brain. Let me export this real quick. Then we can look at it in game. And then this is him falling when he sits. Yeah, so it's a fall and a little hop. Oh, what's he hopping for? Oh, to get up afterwards? Yeah, so he falls, he gets back up, and then he gets squished. And then this is him protesting. Alright. Yeah, so it's just a little hop. Alright, the striking Goomba goes here. And then Goomba builder right here. Animation 0 here. Animation 1 here. Alright, let's look at them real quick. Do I have to apologize after this? No. You can't kill them, Davey. These are not really enemies. They're frenemies. Alright, he's chilling, having a good time. Rip. You know what? The fall kind of works, too. I think it's even funnier. Yeah, I think I'm going to remove the jump at the end. It's just going to be a fall. That is perfectly okay. Because the fall flat on his face, only for him to get squished, works very well. Alright, there we go. We're done for today, and I'll see you guys next time. Bye-bye.
