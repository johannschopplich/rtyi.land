Hello, Chinese Numbahs. 24. 🎵 I ain't got a lot of stuff done off stream here. Hello, PC. Hello, Hedgehog Gamer. I am normal case today. As opposed to a normal case. Yeah, we need some good music. What the fuck? What the hell? What the hell? Oh. I see. I must have accidentally moved the bottom here. Underwater case. Oh, it's the background noise fucked again. It's because of the heating. It's gonna turn off in like a few seconds. Is it that loud? 🎵 It's so annoying. Hopefully, we can soon swap it out. What's the song you're listening to? Chippy Chippy Chapa Chapa. You tried to eat toothpaste, it didn't work? Damn, who could have thought? Case, what's the main... By the way, Case, what's the main R lagging on N64? Lol, assuming from screenshot on Discord. Lilaa, did you drink paint this morning? What the fuck does this letter setup mean? Oh, are you asking if course one was lagging? What the fuck? What's with all the holes in my geometry today? Can you stop eating toothpaste? I did not eat toothpaste. Lies are being spread about me. Life on stream by my own wife. Oh, the geometry is probably just buggy because triangle overflow. So screenshot of it running below 30 FPS in tech discussion. Oh, on the Fast64 Discord, I imported F3DEX3 and it decreased FPS by 20%. Sounds like your microphone gain is goofed up. Is it still like that? Because it was... There was an oven that we have a heater on. It turns on during winter a lot of the time. It's very annoying to be sitting next to it, but it should be off again. Either way, what do we listen to today? Microphone looks like a gleed. No. It sounds like my voice is peaking right now. It looks fine and OBS. Oh, God. Yeah, maybe this is better. OK, Nintendo Cowboy Music. There we go. So I finished a fair bit of content off stream. I'll show you what I did. Meowty, partner. Hehe. I never understood the oven joke, and I still don't. And I don't understand why people keep repeating this one joke. Even though it's not even a joke. What is the sociological explanation for this? How long it takes me to make a hack is entirely dependent on how big the hack is and how high quality I want the hack to be. I can make one in five minutes and I can make one in five years. We're missing like 22 percent. Twitch again. I'm on Twitch and YouTube Dawn. Because Twitch changed the rules recently, so now you're allowed to stream on both at the same time. So basically, there's a treasure hunt here and you open a sign and it says protected by the dragon. And over there is a dragon. Zeina made the dragon, by the way. It looks so weird in high FPS. Oh God, this looks fucking weird. I don't like 30 FPS. It looks like a weird stop motion to me. With a family of cacti. Okay, we didn't make the cacti yet, but I know where this would be. Are you sure 30 FPS is correct? I don't know. Yeah, this I don't know, but it goes. Pulling the trigger. Yeah, I guess I finished the whole area of stream and then also did the next area. We need Benjikazooie death updates. 120 stars are finished now, but then we want 20 more stars. We need to do some overworld stuff still. But almost everything is there. Enclosed by steel. This level is running pretty well in 64. It's like almost 60 FPS. Yeah, we had a star like this in Peach's Fury and I liked it so much that I decided to bring it back. And that's a star. Yeah, he is extremely squishy. Silas said he wanted to rework the squishiness function. He said he had a cool idea. So I'm waiting for that to finish. I was actually thinking we should make a hack. 10 levels, 20 stars in each. 200 star hacks and all stars are like Peach's Fury stars. I think that would be the most popular hack of all time. She's early. Cringe. Do you ever suffer from burnout? You seem to always be modding. No, I actually never suffer from burnout. And that's because I do not have a soul. I think all the stars in this game. No, I don't want that. I want to tell stories in this game. I love how this is just an animation. Add the west-themed props to the level. Yeah. Well, okay. The first area is actually like a proper town. The second area is just like the wildness with random oversized wild west props. And the third area, that is the train station here. Yes, yes. No, I was just born without a soul for some reason. Anyway, today we should make a few NPCs. We're going to make some NPCs of enemies. And we're going to have cowboy hats and maybe cowboy boots. I'm sure my sneeze was peaking the audio. Yeah, of course this runs on real hardware. What do you think I do all the optimization for, for emulator? You mean you got me covered? You did some NPCs? It's going to look very similar, yeah. Why can't you sneeze quietly? Why can't you sneeze quietly, Lilaa? What's your opinion, huh? Alright, the NPCs we need. We need cowboy Yoshis. We need cowboy Toads. We need Monty Moles. Shy Guys. Snuffits and Bandits. Sheila, I can give you life advice. What do you need? Trying A-Star Pathfinding and Pygmalion as a boring NPC if I like fun stuff. That seems like a skill issue on your coding part. Ah, the fucking heating turned on again. Oh my god, this is so annoying. If there's an Umbrella, he's going to have a cowboy hat. I use JetGPD for code. What do you mean? Only sometimes. What do you say in response? Say I'll do my best? Yeah, my optimizations are way past what Umbrella could do. Anyway, let's start with the Shy Guys. I guess the last time we had Shy Guys was in course 7. We should use these guys. Give them a cowboy hat. How do we get here? Theme parkour is my beloved. Oh fuck, look how this opened. How do I fullscreen this? Oh, it fixed itself. Why don't those have lights? Wait. Oh, these are so old that they don't use world lighting yet. That's a good point. Alright, let's refactor these real quick. Or rework them real quick to use world lighting here. That's weird. Okay, we need to make this guy a bit different so he actually has shadings. Why do these have shells in the background? Dude, it's the heating. The heating keeps turning on. It's so annoying. You send over the assets? Alright, I'll take a look at them after I'm done with the parkour here. Okay, so we want this one to be a two cycle material. And we want the second cycle to be combined color modeled by shade color alpha. And then we rename this here into blah blah blah, and this one into alpha, and this one into core. There we go. We fixed him. What the hell is this? Maybe that was a bad idea to rename. Yeah, let me just... Actually, does this make any sense? Does he need to use shade color alpha? Why does this guy use shade color alpha at all, actually? Does that make any sense here? Oh, I used shade color to color him. I see. So I'm gonna use shade color alpha to lerp in between... Between what? Is he supposed to have white shoes? I feel like no. Hello, Biobak. I open my throat wide and start blowing. I mean, okay, that's an interesting strategy. I believe you that it works. Okay. That is very goofy, though. Wait a second. They have a prim color that's being set. Okay, I see. I see how it is. Dude, finally the oven is off again. That noise in the background is a kind of secret underground water tank where he keeps his victims. True. When you have fuzzy effects and OBB is applied, the coins don't move with the shaking effect. True. The coins don't draw from matrix. They are actually sprites. That's what you're seeing. Oh, look at this. And remove geo set prim. Okay. Let me just make sure the parkers still look fine. And if they do, we can move on to making the cowboys. Are you aware that when you sneeze, your mic peaks and it's loud as fuck? It's a sneeze. Don't you have like 5 million Shy Guy models in this game already? Yeah, we are reusing a Shy Guy model. We're giving it a cowboy hat. Oh shit, new pipe. Oh yeah, I didn't talk about the new pipes. Right, right, right. We have new pipes. You didn't see that. You weren't here during the Tuesday bonus stream, Biobak. But we made new pipes on stream. I think they look a little nicer. Don't you agree? Honestly, I'm not a fan of the shoe color. The shoes should be a different color. I'm pretty sure they were a different color. They're cool, but they shouldn't be smooth shaded. You want them to look hexagonal? Or which part of this shouldn't be smooth shaded? I'm not sure I 100% understand you. Man, this Shy Guy color looks so much better actually. Yeah, I gave them darker shoes again. I mean, the edges are supposed to be smooth shaded on the other sides. Oh, they are not actually. Wait. I think that's an optical illusion if anything. Actually, I think I know why you might perceive it to be that way and it might not be fixable. You see right here, this edge is not smooth shaded. But the shine texture is smooth shaded. And if we don't smooth shade the shine texture, it's gonna look really weird. So we can't really do much here. Unless we remove shading on the shine all together. The pipe model? Alright, I'll send you the pipe model. Mom said it's my turn on the pipe model. Yes, I'm making a full Mario game. Currently we have 12 levels done. Send me a pipe. I already sent it to Mio Mike. Should make the pipe a perfect circle. Yeah, let's have a 2 million polygon pipe. Organization of the book. What do you mean? Isn't this perfect? Look at this It's sorted by course. We have an extra one for Sharon Banks. We have Mario's animations. We have our font here This is perfect On Nintendo, it's not getting angry. They're getting sad. They're crying in the corner begging for mercy Clean your desktop you think my desktop is dirty It's been cleaner than it has been in literally a year. Look at this. This is so clean compared to before Make the arms not thin Lilaa okay. I get your point. You want the arms to not be thin but this is not it The Arms only looks so thin because they are pointing down. I guess I guess that's still kind of bad All right, I give them two extra triangles, how's that sound Now he's buffer Don't make fun too late. There you go No, I think this looks good now Shy guy bold season true Did you guys see my post today on on Twitter? Me hitting 225 17 reps easy No, then you missed out I'll wait and you still need to shy guy Put the arm bones in the armpits and tweak the way they'll also look better. Is that not what I did wait I Guess they're not quite in the armpits I Guess that looks kind of nice All right, then we'll be it I'm not making any more edits right now I Like I mean take away on this you can bench press a lot but not you're gonna be a dad It's part of the case brand, you know It cares that I'm gonna be a dad all you care about that. I make optimized games and can bench a lot Also, you guys seeing my new shirt I got this for Christmas It's a bunch of cats Oh Yeah, we also need to think about a name for this level I was thinking high noon Hills kind of fucking sucks I don't like it You know work with the government congratulations you sold your soul you are going to hell I Need to think about a name for the baby no who cares how the baby is named I Don't even have to shine a cowboy. Yes Holy boy Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah me me me me me this song is so good Love to love it with the cats, you know I Do need a lower poly hands, but this is not it I Know They're not gonna have social media until they're old enough Lilaa If My child grows up to call my UVs terrible and they're getting put up for adoption What if my kid watches this in like 20 years and he's like them So lucky I didn't get put up for adoption What if they're watching this from the orphanage in 20 years? Then shouldn't have called his UVs bad If you're so happy, why do you feel the need to make sure? Everyone knows like like that's not just normal for you You have to be like I swear. I'm happy I Think twice we all test it. Nope. That looks like a flan. What the hell is that? Still ahead from the cave mouse model. Oh, that's an idea Dude that'd be so weird if my kid watched all my streams While in West Wasteland, that's such a boring name, I don't want this hat the hell this looks terrible What the hell is this Now I'll make him a new head You shouldn't make the wine bombing Martin dizzy and beat him over the drama we do need From your mouse. Oh, let me see what you made You're making a head for the Yoshi's all right How did you name the file did I lose the file I Don't have to file Biobak or I must have overwritten on an accident I Sure hope I didn't undo all of my exchanges in this level Hello scatterbug razor Now It still looks like my back area Sending to you. All right, I I Need to put that on my list then to import a new mouse model Why did you make fender shifts in Super Mario 64, I don't know what that is Do you guys think I should put Managed to hit 200,000 subs without becoming a pedophile on my LinkedIn You think that would be a good thing to have on there Send up that is fucking sick-looking I think that should stay on Twitter Welcome to the cowboy stream I Am big guy now It's funny I Joined at the right time. Yep We're making a whole cowboy level I I Have dirt on you watch out shit Oh, yeah, this looks fucking sick What in tarnation Dude, the last two weeks have actually been crazy. I've been watching so many cowboy movies I've been I'm basically method acting designing a video game Everything's just cowboys in my world right now I feel like we should just kind of drag it into his face like so Oh Yeah, I should show you guys the train station to Let me let me do this with the proper mood of like the actual game audio It's the train station Some dead trees some crates So this is gonna be where you're actually gonna have a shootout with three Goombas five Goombas actually They're gonna be looking at you and they go this town ain't big enough for the six of us I'm gonna have like a conductor here. He's gonna be like a toad guy. He's conducting the calamari train And he will tell you there's like a robbery That happened and that five Goombas are the suspect and then right here there will be just like a huge stack of Goombas in a trench coat and you're gonna have to figure out how to Like accuse them of doing the crime So you only have to do some stuff to topple them over and then they'll have a shootout with you They have those cord guns from Mario Party 2 So, I think this works as a boss fight area I'm talking private for a project. Sure. Just send me an email or something. Oh Yeah, let me actually add the assets Zeno just made to this area here as well Who's she And it's good sure you can message me on this court, too But I have a hundred message requests, so I probably not see it That's gonna be amazing, yeah this level I feel like I feel like recently I have a leveled up a lot of my skills and this level is like the first one that Has those applied and I'm pretty happy with it It's very thematic everything is purposeful and I like that a lot All right. I like the rocks now. Well some of the UV mapping here. So a little bit iffy But I don't think there's much we can do here Yeah, the new rock textures are much better Hell and tree is the cactus is still what it was before. All right, this is all we need from here I Handsome build is true Are they made with blender rot generator no Zeina made those manually by hand Oh Makes sense You see the sneaky triangles you see more Are there any sneaky triangles I missed I Don't think so. I think I got them all or are you on a long-ass delay? Zeina are these mirrored or are these different ribs? Oh It's just a game you can see Well, you put in a triangles to the inside of these which would be sneaky triangles But they are very easy to just pick and delete I Hate making clean fair I Miss me dude, everyone in this game is gonna just be drinking milk. We have to keep this like pg-8, you know They're all gonna be drinking milk. They're gonna shoot cork guns It's gonna be all goofy I Think these are not actually fuck shaders. Yeah What happened Oh, I think Yeah, face corner color face gonna bite color Huh It's still wrong the hell Bargain Are a milky no ice yep it seems about right the funniest is gonna be just a guy going I'm lactose intolerant but I'm milk anyway like cowboys aren't known for following the rules I saw this online but it's like such a funny line I can't not have it replaying the old materials this is because of the products colors and if I just reapply the old materials the products colors will be missing I might just have to redo the vertex colors it is what it is wait why don't I just use this material here I should be reusing that anyway surely it won't bother say not much we just redo them town with a no-name reference I don't know what that is the hell there we go so I want them slightly brown oh god I feel like I'm them up let me just step this open on the side Thomas no name is the biggest meme game to have ever existed and you don't know that nope this world bartenders have moomoo so they can get the milk from the source by Moomoo's you mean the cows from the Moomoo meadows I mean this is what the bar building looks like it's just like a cow colored building with some cowbirds and a big free milk bottles at the top he exports probably with bleeding now that is very very good holy shit all my prayers have been answered I'm still not re-exporting Mario until I'm basically done with the project because every time I do everything goes to shit but that's very very good anyway oh that's way too saturated too bright yeah this should be fine right do we have any more rips here here cuz under the Mario universe only Moomoo's oh okay rail rogue range I like the word rogue in the title but rail also range it's an interesting idea but I'm not a hundred percent sold on it some of the color of the sparkles me actually I'll be honest we might have to slightly reshape the story the whole Yoshi slave labor plot is maybe a bit too dark maybe it's more like just Bowser kidnaps the Yoshi well I mean okay I guess we don't refer to the slave labor I don't know I mean yes he kidnaps the Yoshis I don't know what the proper way to do this would be that's why we do the overworld last so that we can do the plot afterwards to fit the worlds because plot in Mario games is kind of very secondary all right let me just make sure this all works fine also in a cowboy hat is perfect actually all right let's compile and run into the game maybe include that big purple Yoshi from Mario & Luigi games I don't know him honestly I know Boshi is that him maybe Bowser just wants two omelettes dude I love the tumbleweed here the tumbleweed is so good it's such a small addition but it gives the game like so much movement and vibe and makes the world feel so alive okay we definitely have to make this climbable so that doesn't happen is this jump too difficult well okay and when you can't climb it definitely because like you can't just reach it with a normal jump you can just long jump over big-ass gun yeah I'm not a hundred percent sold on the big-ass gun either I think the big-ass gun looks too serious I was thinking shotgun this kind of cowboy style but eh how do I make the cow the tumbleweeds look so good they just spawn in front of the camera somewhere and then they just go through the world there's much to it too out of place it doesn't have placeness yeah but I mean what about the horseshoe and I mean the the hoof iron or the wheels they also don't really have the placeness I wanted this one to feel a little more surreal I guess but I'm not really a hundred percent on the idea well I definitely don't have time to reply to a long-ass message while I'm streaming but maybe afterwards dead-eye dunes grand ascent gulch the round or dustbowl is on all those are come there's there's some cool ideas in there we usually want names that either have rhymes in them or alliterations so that I dunes works grandstand gulch I mean it kind of rolls off the tongue yeah grandstand I like grandstand grandstand something what's the third word that rhymes with sand and is related to cowboys bone-dry but or bone-dry badlands badlands also yeah I agree by a leg that's why I'm not a hundred percent on this area either really I was just kind of desperate to fill this area with something and I thought what if I just have random oversized Western related props would that work out and then I just made them that's true the dry bone guy from YouTube will have a field day grandstand to badlands it's kind of a smooth name yeah let's just temporarily name it that I think this is fine for a name for now grand bandit badland oh bandit also kind of works bandit badland also kind of has a nice ring to it so you like my my water SFX what are you thinking for this area and standby I'm like it could just be skeletons I feel like it kind of works with just skeletons because we want we do want this to be the outskirts also this is gonna be just a bunch of barrels just rolling down by the way in case you're wondering what this is shy guy badlands cuz there's no alterations and no rhymes or not that's a very boring name can we like abandoned mine shaft tracks yeah but that's gonna be here yeah I had the same idea but it's gonna be here I already have that idea in here no that was actually just the water that was not an SFX how about Canyon no do all that meltdown I didn't know that was a thing dry dry desert I feel like there's a video games that already used that name do we want to be the 101st no there's a nice big empty space in the middle what is gonna be there so I was thinking okay there's two options here the first is we leave it empty because having stuff just around the area and not in the middle is awesome for performance the second idea is that if you do the mission with the signs right here some temple or something is gonna come up from the middle with the star on it just to have like a really cool visual of hey you did the mission I was thinking we only do that if we are feeling extra generous towards the player I do want this to be like the Indiana Jones type exploring things you're not supposed to explore thing you know the lost temple or whatever I never I wish we had a rock that's kinda giving arrow vibes does that make sense can a rock if arrow vibes hillbilly bad lights you know what I call the people you're living here hillbillies that's not nice shit okay oh heart you know what the exact idea that you just said where is it I had it written down the exact idea you just said where is it maybe I removed it because I had no need for it anymore but yes that was an idea I had written down and I just didn't edit what if a big hawk nest in the middle cutscene showing him landing and shitting on the stars so you have to platform all the way to the end where you detonate dynamite to scare him off we already have the six stars decided and I do want all the stars to be about outlaws your catch because that has more of a Wild West vibe to me I'm fine with a huge ass hawk and a huge ass nest and all that but I don't think we can really evolve them into a star there's three outlaws well actually there are seven outlaws and you catch them I don't know if I if I explained this but basically this is like this is an old Wild West town and the Wild West there's always bad guys around there's gonna be the sheriff's office here and there's gonna be bad guys in here and you have to solve three secrets that will each give you a star so first there's gonna be like a secret room in the saloon kind of like the rocket hideout in the Pokemon games and once you go in there you'll be in like some mines and you'll have a shootout with like a snifit there's the five Goombas that the train robbery and then you have to have a shootout with and in the gold mines it's gonna be full of snifits and the gold mines are so it's gonna be a red coin mission and the last one is right there was a bank robbery here and there's gonna be Monty Mole digging tracks going here all the way over here to this house and there's gonna be like a secret Monty Mole cave where you have to do a boss fight with the Monty Mole so there's gonna be a lot of boss fights in this level and it's gonna be the only level with more than one boss fight most levels actually have zero but I think it's just a very stylish choice for a Western level hello sailor Tyrell hi guy noon we for now we have grandsons and badlands which kind of works although I guess it doesn't sound too cowboy II we do want it to sound more cowboy I like the gold in this level Sonic Unleashed I'm not interested in Sonic games it's shine you he should say that oh that's such a fun thing to say I'm not sure if I'm convinced by the color of these rocks by the way I'm just now thinking that what about a color like this you guys think that's better they know what do you think you made those initially instead of the desaturated gray so you can always put a network house yet true that was impressive yeah but I'm not gonna play a game because it's an impressive part I don't care if a game is a technical achievement I just want to play fun games I'm like the last person that should say this but it is the truth maybe me get lighter all right I still gotta turn on fuck on these otherwise they look very out of place I don't let's turn on fuck what's going on this might be a render error the fuck okay let me actually look at this in-game see if it renders properly there Oh, he looks very cool. I like this Might need a better texture for the head one with a bit more structure on it, but I can do that I have a texture and it's perfect for this Blistering blistering you're getting blisters here Billowing barrel, what does billowing mean? I don't want to use cryptic words that I don't understand in level titles. That seems so forced I need to add the head and sunglasses the armature. Yeah, no problem Since it's really hard basically. Oh, okay. Well the rocks render correctly in game. So I think we're good. I Still have to agree with my own back down and having these random big Western props It's not really not the good vibe that we want really Then there's one corner on these rocks that's lighter than the others and it's kind of bothering me I'm gonna change that I Don't like that Wait what what the hell? I Guess the rocks will never render correctly again, but that's fine Don't make it feel like worms for you. If you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah, I see what you mean Yeah, exactly better I agree with that Yes, there is more like a graveyard yeah, this is supposed to be the outskirts and They are dangerous to live in very Miss messages for the rocks too Great. Now, I know I missed your suggestion, but I don't know what your suggestion was Blend supreme color at the bottom to fade into the sand color. Oh That doesn't work. We have a very weird combiner here. Unfortunately It's an additive combiner Seems sad in the sky Yeah, this is more like canyons than desert. It's not supposed to be a desert level. It's supposed to be just a wild west on Using fuck. Yep. It's still additive. I can do what I want Lilaa. No one can stop me a Layout fuck floating between the leg. Yes, they will fade into the fog at the bottom You don't need to use vertex alpha to the additive look at this I Have a very cool combined idea actually since they're both intensity textures. I can use the texture alpha and Just use the combined color alpha this way I can have three multiplications in my combined instead of just two Insane, right? Neither way back to this guy. I can I want to give him cowboy boots as well And we should replace this texture with one that looks more cowboy ish It doesn't look very cowboy to me, let's see if there's someone model resource All the seagulls kicking them stuff what is there when you fall down the pits That would have to have been done at the beginning of the planning now, it's kind of too late to completely change the area How do cowboy pants look like? Yeah, something like this. I want the belly like a belt like this Can we maybe find the models from the n64 Mario Party 2 game I There we go, that's a nice texture I like this This is perfect for a cowboy a nice leather belt what the hell Where's my texture I love my texture where's my texture there it is Hmm Okay, this is also a texture with an alpha layer So we could make that work. Do we keep the star on here or the replay that was something else? I DO NOT LIKE THIS But no it's too late to just add changes like that to this game now I Case you should make a little level. I love I don't you make any level. Hey, love. Why don't you make a Lilaa me check? See see what you got now you got verbally abused that's what you get for saying some stupid stuff I West star son son He's got the skill in you ask him to help you make a video Have you guys seen that skill in you Renamed the video from case insulted me to case insulted me and then in brackets Joe Guy is so funny Did I love drama I Think the yellow here looks weird, but I think if I just make this gray scale it will look fine. Oh Yeah My man took a year before turning it into a joke That is exactly what happened I Have made several case me Jack Lila, you can't can't diss me here. I'm sorry Hello when best cool, dude I don't like that. The spacing isn't even if I cut it here. I Also don't want to shrink it because shrinking it looks terrible actually this works I think It still looks good on index colors aren't we have two indexes in game though because Photoshop is stupid I Cooper NPC with a really tall hat Is he gonna be the bartender if so, then yes, I'm fine with that How I make things like this. I don't know. How do you I Make him like a show. I'm on stream You can just watch the stream and you'll figure it out Where did my texture go There we go And the mustache a mustache sounds very fitting here When you learn row making there is a huge document on the simple flips discord that has a lot of info You could look at that one I Would be up for that How fast do you think we would get shut down by Nintendo if you made the roaming Academy Oh I see. Oh, we're out of music Soundcheck from an imaginary Western. All right, two minutes. That's optimistic You Send me the bell texture. Okay before or after the edit, I'll just send you the before edit one What do you want to do with it, oh you wanted for your Cooper after the edit Oh The document has well, I mean how much you need to know depends on how intelligent you are So I cannot promise you that that's everything you need to know Because you might be stupid and I don't know it, you know I Love stomping Koopas. I'm sure there's a rhyme with stomping Koopas and Bruton tootin cowboy somewhere You All right, that's starting to look decent Do you ever not reply back to something which you didn't know how to reply to but now it's been a bit and you feel You shouldn't say anything No Hello ask you Thank you for the sub As patches wait what whatever missing I Guess we can't really do that without it looking weird Then that sucks You All right, I Think it's but looks nice. We're gonna have to do a few changes to you map here. But other than that Actually, I don't think we need to change even about oh, oh actually the corners here are weird Should probably be like that I Still think should be further in Yeah Hello mushy That would be very neat Davey, but that's that's a lot of work to animate like that I probably have to make this old star a separate model You have a pet peeve in video games or something that tends to get repeated and noise here you can do anything like the leg of visuals Deep head controls Like anything that is not actual proper analog controls anything that is digital controls absolutely, he did I I remember playing Spyro on ps1 and Instantly I was like dude this game is shit and I realized it was because of the d-pad so we went and we got the Spyro reignited trilogy and we booted it up and The first thing on the fucking stick they put an emulated d-pad on the stick Instead of giving you proper analog controls. I was so pissed. How could they possibly do that? I'm early for you. But Thomas did the worst part is the ps1 with you. You have a dual shock controller and Actually will be analog controls, but in the Spyro reignited trilogy 25 years after Mario 64 came out. They are still not using analog controls. That's not excusable Okay What else is missing for him to be a proper cowboy does he need to wear a vest I Feel like making a West on him that's gonna be very difficult But he should have cowboy boots. It's for authenticity. It's not it wasn't like this on the ps1 That's the crazy part and you know what the worst part is look at the controller you have a stick here If you actually wanted to use the d-pad, why not use the fucking d-pad? It's right there You think you're all right me that's trolling me lives on a trolling arc This is what cowboy boots look like Wait, isn't there a cowboy shy guy in one of the Mario parties? Kind of Interesting Needs a piece of wheat in his mouth What if your child told you that what would happen, you know exactly what would happen I Would no longer have a child he would be disowned. I Could just change the color of this and would kind of look like a vest Let me try that Hmm Doesn't really look good You think Zeina has a heart no There's no excuse here the kids getting disowned for that one Yeah, this doesn't look good at all he looks so naked I I Feel like I could use a texture with an alpha channel here to have the corners be more rounded and have it look like a proper vest Maybe there's some stuff in the warrior gunman texture here. I Can't go further back great I Will give him a court gun the same way that they have one in the Mario Kart Mario Party games I Feel like I made a 3d model for one already Well kind of It's more like a real gun, but yeah You Let's see does any of these have a texture we can use I Think this one might work if you think a different part of this texture Let's try it 64 by 64 should be able to make this work. I Could just make most of this texture red and then use that as the texture for his whole body here Might work better than alpha channel  Read against red nope I Want it looks weird Oh Actually kind of works, I don't like the hole here. I'm gonna fill that one with just painting it up Let's try it I So when you get 100 constants, I'm getting a star you get walked to Tahiti there's actually no 100 coin stars in this game Fun fact Hello Pytro Richard Oops Is there a texture on this no We can just have this be a basic s texture actually I Just need to make sure that the lowest row of this Exactly matches the RGB values of this and this is full red. So then that's not difficult I actually on second thought maybe it'd be better if all of this was pure red Without the detail. I think that would look less weird It fits better with the other red part and also gives us more color space for the vest There's a level of a sheriff, yeah, but as he is hopelessly overworked he has no hope of catching all these criminals I Look so bad fuck Surely there's a way to make this be decent But it's not it's not this God this is awful I Usually don't paint texture so I don't really know how it works. I'm kind of just improvising here I Like the sick flap here, but I'm not sure if I can paint that on I'm just gonna make something that kind of works and then we can still improve it later, I guess I Please fix that part of the texture what part of the texture It Still just looks like he's wearing a vest that is way too small for him. Not like he's a dangerous cowboy criminal Yeah, the texture just expands like the detail on it it's just not dead No, this doesn't work So jaggedy burn top left Now all of this is bad It just doesn't work I Don't think I have to texture artist skill to make this one work Need some yeah, I also think that would work better I Mean I can probably just Cut this I Don't have to rest hang like that This is difficult to make work Yeah, it is this allowed but if you get banned we get banned it is what it is I Get the math on the shy I definitely don't want my cowboy shy guy to look so much worse than the one Nintendo users Keeps arms untouched it. I mean the arms untouched it kind of works But the vest texture is just bad the one we have Nobody snitch and works, but what about Yeah fair But what if there's just one person that really hates me like that one person that's like the number one Nintendo fanboy That's like man we have to stop modders from stealing Miyamoto's lunch money See there's two people already The D. Okay. Yeah, exactly That just makes all my thumbnails worse and turns the titles into things that I can actually make any sense With the rowdy and Nelson, is that his name? That kind of works Let's give him a cute little gun Whoops I Opinion on the pipe. Alright, let me look and buy a mix of the pipe real quick Hmm Test less intense of a shine. Do you think it would be okay to do something like That I think I've asked I prefer it like this And that's not nice though Let me see what you did here Use shade color alpha to blend between text zero and print. Oh, that's how you made the top shiny I see Looks like it's from the DS version to vote from the DS version was kind of ass It's not the prediction pipe shape it's not That's crazy news to me Wait, how do you blend this to black though? How did you do that It's primitive color just black. No, it's not it's green. How is he blending to black? Oh No, no, no, we have to have lighting on Okay, you can't have lighting off it doesn't work by a leg if you have lighting off your environment map doesn't work and If you have lighting off the pipe doesn't look proper in the world, so we need to keep lighting on So now we have this issue here. Oh No, I don't see sorry miss anymore because I'm multi streaming Code what Maya I missed that message He's already using vertex alpha to control the shininess She's I'm like they call it the mace. Yeah, but it's also making the colors a lot less intense, right? It looks completely different All right now play your song request she taught me to yodel I Free the x3 right now is 20% slower compared to what we have so we can't use F3DEX3 for now I'm not 100% confident that we can use F3DEX3 in the end I Got a lower poli that's gone. Of course I can but I don't want to that seems silly I don't think they have 4.0 support yet I Used that song so good. This is what you into I Don't judge I The more stupid the better you listen to the broccoli song Definitely just no way I Guess the broccoli song by GPF. No one agrees with my music taste here I Think it looks bad. I Mean he needs a gun somehow, but that needs to look good. It needs to be a corkscrew gun There's one in my party too This is what they do here You cocked me That's what this revolver looks like Definitely not the one from space frogs from gpf Should make them shoot the guns that dropped in the flank. Let's say bang. They will shoot corks at you We do need enemies on this level we just don't wait it should be a holster the fuck am I doing Oh Yeah, we'll just give them a holster like this that's way easier Of a code single action army, of course, I know exactly what that is because I am american I Guess I could google it. I don't blame you. That's just stupid So So Yeah, I think that outline works for a holster Yeah Though I think they usually care like for the front like this One more vertex Yeah, that's cool hello see charm Let's bring up music random western music the bottom's two-pointed What's gonna end somehow So What do you want me to do for the bottom Wait, what did I just do? I think I just made a mistake Then it just turns into a vex color blood no, okay My first language is german Hello I have no interest in making my own video game for the n64 I'd rather just make a new one in a modern engine and then actually sell it Um, how's the background song overlay automatically gonna figure out the song though That's the issue, right Other programs that somehow just pull the youtube video you have open So Hello metal dude, don't worry metal dude, I don't remember any of that Besides I'm annoyed at like literally everything If I were mad at people for being annoying, I would be mad at everyone all the time So And in this city I make games for the last it's an interesting market niche But I don't even know if you're allowed to do it for n64 And they have no way of producing cartridges either Where would we find the fitting texture I don't know Should this even have a textile Or should this just be smooth To a modern obj, is that different from just obj or is it is obj considered a modern format So But no, I do not have a way There are ways you can find online via nemu or the 1996 emulator Yeah, the 196 emulator rather Um Well, if you're gonna rip all the mario 64 models to make a game then you're not gonna be legal on that one Yeah, that's the extended obj the obj format is very easy you can just add anything you want to it The question is whether the interpreter also also support for that I See mate and r6 are very spongy. Oh shit. They are applicable everywhere I mean a lot of them are very specific to mario 64 But the techniques used are applicable everywhere Okay, zayna this is looking very fun I like him senor koopa He looks so much like a cowboy wow So Yeah, so what do we do about the vest I like the idea of pointy boots This guy should also have pointy boots honestly  Mustache turtle So Oh, yeah, I like that Yeah Dude this whole level is just about the style of the wild west I think none of these people canonically even are cowboys. They just like to pretend to be cowboys like all of them We're just appropriating cowboy culture Yeah What does it mean to be a cowboy it means to be rootin it needs to be shootin and it means to be drinking milk from a milk bar Still thinking about the west Maybe something untouchable resource I Love drinking milk at the milk bar me too It also means to scream yeehaw exactly and it means to greet people by saying howdy Howdy partner They're searching for vest All right Oh, these are certainly vests Hmm, I don't think any of these workers textures Hmm Surely there's something we can think of I think one issue here is that this is connected if this wasn't connected. It'd be a bit easier to find a good texture Or I could just have this be a polygonal cutout. I mean, he's only 146 triangles, right? Surely it wouldn't be a big deal So So This is a club penguin animation No, wait, not club. Penguin. This is a nude nude. How's the penguin called? That's what this looks like Pengu maybe that's his name So That's terrible hello edgewood we're working on a cowboy So Huh, that's something it still looks so undersized on him Hmm We want to only focus on this side here honestly, I kind of like it Hmm Could you bench him yeah easily So So The bottom part here is so long lanky Then because you're at my party with family You see that's a good time Basically you trip so any vest will look weird. Yeah So I think the gap here is too big and that's one huge issue here So The head is not detachable now So Hello stick figures master That he had more room under the arms I think this is acceptable. I don't think it's good Ah, yes, we guys check inside at the tangible as we all know It's true that the rest on the shy guys is lower I Wonder if this looks better maybe Answer yeah, that's look like the arms are too high up Maybe that's more like it Yeah, I think it's starting to look fine So Don't hate this, but did you ever get to know if your iq is higher than your own parents? What are they? I mean I guess I never seen them take a test With a less pointy arm use too much resources No, we can make it less pointy if we want I guess we can experiment with that I Guess it's 10 extra triangles should be fine But it still looks weird on animations now Are there multiple vertex colors on these There are that's why it looks weird Okay, might be fixable then. Oh god. Okay, this might just be what we have to live with. Girls rule, boys drool, false. Do you strangle by changing the flat part of the head from a pentagon to a rectangle or a single tri? I mean, of course, but that would look terrible. Actually, you mean this part here? The head. I guess the head could technically... No, it can't be. When the arms extrict from the body. I think this one should be moved forward. Yeah, he's giving me proper cowboy vibes now. Like you doubt all boys exist? You think they all just spawned in as men or like what does this mean? Since Transport couldn't make that layer of the head just one single big triangle. That's worse for performance because it's more pixels you draw. But even then, the texture is mirrored, so no. By connecting the jacket to the belt. I could, but I don't want to. Wait, the jacket and the belt are connected. Yeah, triangle count is completely overrated. In fact, it's so overrated I have a whole video about how overrated it is, because people keep telling me about triangle counts when it doesn't really matter much. That's also why I now added them. I didn't know how useless triangle count optimizations were until just recently. That's why he was so low poly at the beginning. But now that I know, we can just add more, I guess. Ten million triangles per frame on N64 win. Yeah, that one might actually be an issue. Alright, Zeina's also making a Goomba. I don't know if we actually want a Goomba here, though, to be honest. Maybe we don't want a Goomba, but we can use the head for something else. We want, let's see, Monty Maw, Snuffit, Shy Guy, Toad, I think? Yoshi? Maybe Bandits? Yeah, there's so many NPCs in here already. Oh, wait, no, we do need Goombas. Never mind. God, fuck, there's so many NPCs in this. Maybe we should cut the Bandits. Yeah, Bandits would be a good one. The problem is, we have so many NPCs now, it's kind of overkill. We do want the town to feel cohesive, right? And if we have so many different kinds of NPCs, it's kind of, I guess it kind of works. Yeah, we definitely have Goombas for the boss. I'm thinking maybe one or two Goombas also live in the town. I guess it's a very diverse town. Okay, question. In this area here, we're going to have one guy being like, I heard of a treasure and they said X marks the spot, but I can't find the treasure or something like that. He's going to be in this area somehow. Which NPC race would fit best here? I don't think it should be a shy guy. I don't feel like it's a toad either. It's definitely not a Yoshi. The Yoshis all live on the ranch. Can't believe K's added fucking politics to RTYI again. Monty Mole. Yeah, a Monty Mole kind of fits. Maybe. Okay, then let's place the first shy guy in front of the roll shop here. That's a good place for one of the shy guys to be. Yeah, I'm not adding even more races to this. It's already too much. Can't see the X because he's a Molten, he's blind. Oh, that's a good point. K's, did you just cancel yourself? I am so canceled. It's so over for me. Fuck me. Fuck that guy. Would you rather have 1 million US dollars or 1 million German money? Of course, 1 million German money and then I just traded for US dollars and now I have like 1.05 million. That's a stupid question. What would you do if it meant you had to help the world with it? Get 10 trillion dollars and then I help the world with it. I'm fine with that. German money. Yes. Oh, he needs a shadow too. Do we not have any shy guys with a shadow so far? We do not. Cool. But we know it's hitbox and we can gather the... No, we can't. Okay, my chat is being weird today. I see, I see how it is. Girls are paid government actors to make me feel bad. Yeah, everyone's in on it. The government's our team's messing specifically with you. Right. I completely forgot about the add interest function. We should use bparam4 for the animation. Let's make a few parameters. bparam1 dialogue.  Oh no, bparam4, okay. bparam1 animation, bparam2 turnval, bparam3 maybe turn distance. Should work out. Oh, is uvo the boomer thing now? Thank you Lilaa, I'll keep that in mind. Next time I want to type uvo, I will make sure not to. Anyone older than me is a boomer. That sounds like a Twitter thing. Seems like something they would do over there. Square bparam3, so if it's 100, it's going to be like 1000. I don't think I need to multiply this with anything anymore then. Oh wait, no, that doesn't make any sense. You should multiply it by 100. All right. Let's see them in game. I'm also out of music again. Is my sound completely gone or did I just turn it down? Okay. I need to change the warp. I've heard of that scale, but it's not going to happen. We all know that. As if that would actually happen. Hello, hello. Oh, he looks nice. He's a bad boy. He looks so much better with the lighting in game. What Lilaa? Why are you casing me? Lilaa. No, he's a bad boy. Look at them. He wouldn't want you to call him a good boy. He's a cowboy. Dude, let him be a bad boy. So what would be a good distance for him to start turning? I think 100 is a bit much. Maybe like 600 coordinates is fine. Turning velocity 0x80 is too little. 0x40 might be good. Animation 0. All right. Oh, God, what happened here? Oh, no. It looks so messed up now. Dude, we already have so many textbox. This is 116.  372-256 is 116. You know, one foot binding for tomorrow. That's confused and uses baseball. I think it would be funny if you just had a single beat. I was confused about what genre they were supposed to be dressing for. And then dressed like a medieval knight or something. Funny, but no. Doesn't fit my vibe. It's all about the vibe. The static assert failed, and I know why. You said your age in German. What would that number mean? It would still be 28. Just in German. That's a bug. Is this cowboy hat too big? I'm kind of leaning towards slightly. Okay. So you guys agree it's too big. That's good.  Sure, it's possible to make it knock it around. But I don't want the pointy hat. His shadow is too small. Why is the shadow so small? Oh, I know why. It's because shadows actually are having a radius of 50 and not 100. There we go. Now he has a shadow. I think he looks good now. Shadow should be less transparent though, eh more transparent. Yeah plenty of people asked for a cowboy hat for mario just for this level. I'm still not 100% decided on it. I think we should do the explorer first just so that one mission is already done. That's actually insane dude. We started on this level like 2 weeks ago and we already have the first mission done. This is gonna be like the fastest developed level yet and it's so cool looking too. I guess that's what 2 weeks of vacation do. Alright let's get Monty Mole. I don't think we ever had a Monty Mole in this game. Anyone remember Monty Mole we put into this game? Brakes are very important. Not for me. Someone asked earlier why I never get burned out. It's because I don't have a soul. I'm literally just a robot. I just make game. I just don't stop. I'm just that Mario. Yeah let's do Monty Mole next. Let's rip the original Mario 64 model. Yeah exactly. That's one thing I don't want. That was the first concern I brought up too when someone asked about it. That's caffeine. I don't even use much caffeine. I actually cycle caffeine. I'm pretty healthy about caffeine. I think this is the guy. Well if you rely on motivation it's not gonna work. You just have to do the thing regardless of whether you want to or not. It's really that simple. Like just do the thing. I don't know why everyone's struggling. I can't tell if this is a Monty Mole. This looks like that fighting type Pokemon. But what else would this be? Yeah Makuhita. It's the mole. Let's see if you're right. I will import one of the animations and see if it still looks anything like a mole. Oh it's the mole. There he is. Yeah we're gonna completely remake the animations. All the Mario 64 animations are so unusable. Look at this. The mole has 17 bones. Do you see where this would have 17 bones? One for the body. One for the hat. Maybe two for each arm. One for the foot. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. It should have 8. But it has 17. It was 96. They couldn't have known. Yeah mole IRL has hundreds of little bones. True. Think about how insane the optimization actually is dude. Real moles have so many bones. They use just a few. I think this next section might be the nose. I don't think that was the nose. What the hell. Let's look at Monty Mole Mario 64. No that actually is supposed to be nose texture. The hell this is what they look like. Look at this. That's generally just what they look like. Okay. At last we need to get. Oh I see. This one is just teeth. I like the teeth. Oh and this is like a cheek texture I see. Does it use this one here? No. It does use this texture here but not like me though. I see how it is. I wish the rib from the model was just perfect. There we go. We finished ripping the model. Why are people talking about Stalin and Hitler right now? We are modding Mario. What's up with the nose? That's just what the nose looks like. This is what they did in Mario 64. Look at him. Do you think maybe this was an environment map instead? Definitely not. We have Trump 64. I wonder what would make something like that. I don't know. Do you guys think I should make another Super Trump 64 if he is up for vote again next year? Would that still be funny? Or is it just sad at that point? He was almost disqualified. Didn't that happen last time too? Wait wait. Okay. I need to understand this. Why was he almost disqualified? And why is he even allowed to run again? Wasn't he impeached or something? Doesn't that mean anything? Hello CAC Honka Honka. Should I run for president of Canada? I don't think I can. Oh, I see. Imagine. They tried to evade a trial or bias. Can we just trip every five seconds? Oh, that would be funny. A run like where you just trip all the time. And then you have to do a dementia test. That's like the final boss. I wish there were more JoMentum memes. I like them. Yeah, we're not going to use the model as is by the way. I think this looks terrible. Hmm. I want it to be properly mirrored. Should I maybe just split them down the middle and then mirror them manually? I think that's the proper option here. It's going to be a bitch to animate if we don't do this properly. I think it's easier to split them if I just do this instead of actually intersecting everything. We can still remove these triangles afterwards, but we do need them right now. To be disqualified from running, the law says you need to have committed treason or conspiring against a country or some such, but they never actually define what falls under that. So now it's a huge legal battle when deciding what the actual definition should be. Okay, I'm looking forward to that. Okay. I mean, sure, I would be capable of being a good ruler, but I'll be honest. I'm going to abuse the shit out of my power. I'm going to come out of office with $200 million in my bank account. You do not want me as your ruler. That would be terrible for every human. Why are you going to use it? That's the whole point of it. Would you optimize the economy? Actually, yes, I probably would. I don't know. That depends. You know what? You should make me ruler, but also give me like $200 million beforehand so I have no more motivation to get more money. Then I would do a good job. I think it's better to have these feet down here. Yeah, to be honest, you guys have too many bones anyway. You can spare a few. And you have $200 million, you start to want $2 billion. No, I think that's false in my case. Okay, well, we need new textures for this anyway. That's not true. That's a bit too negative. I wouldn't do that. It's true. The tailbone is definitely unnecessary. We don't need that at all. Waste of calories and nutrients. Okay, I think that was a long enough stream for today. We're going to make him into a cowboy. We're going to put him in there. We're going to do a few more things, but that's going to happen another day. We also need to make all new textures because the ones he has right now are very suboptimal. They're all RGBA textures, which take really long to load compared to what we could have here. So I'll see you guys in the next stream next Saturday. Bye bye. Transcribed by https://otter.ai
