Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Clayman, I didn't get your song because my whole chrome crashed. What happened? I had to restart my computer because for some reason it was very laggy. This is going to ruin my stream stats unfortunately. It was a very interesting annotation, I originally thought it was for ECC, but I guess I was wrong. Thank you very much for the video. Error correction? Is that what ECC is? Hello, unknown? Can you hear this again? Yes, Clayman. Just send it again and hopefully this time it will work fine. I need Discord for bio back in a bit. Hello?  Hello? You're starting with neon blue here. Delete this. How do I remove it? Okay, it's gone. There's a delete button. What is unique mode? I don't know.  Help programming? Is he behaving so far? Yes. This is not a very good gradient. Alright, let's see if the Clayman song works this time. It works! I'll select now. It's way better. Hello, auto-direct? I'm gonna wait for the reset of the stream this time, and it didn't automatically restart as I was trying to make a backup. Nice. Where's my gradient? Why is the gradient not here? Do I have the stupid? Oh, there we go. There we go. There we go, that's what I want. Instead of CamShank, we have TunaShank right now, I think, and it's like a group goal. There we go. There we go. That's just the texture I want. The pure white one sucks. There's no pure white. CMYK, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow. It's a very ugly gradient. Here's it now. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just gonna cut out the color. There's no gradient here. It should not be like that. There should be... Oh wait, maybe that's what... Yeah, there we go. Is there any good event where the engine can download a runner guard and run them right off? No, the engine code will release together the rest of the game. So I'm thinking the way the spritz will work is... We're gonna have it here. It's gonna be... What the fuck? Okay, that looks weird as fuck. But just trust me that this is fully transparent right now. You can see it being fully transparent here. Alright. And then after you press on the switch, it's gonna do this. And you can walk over it. And then it's gonna change color. And then it's gonna just disappear here eventually. Like that. Let's go straight to alpha. There needs to be a warning that the bridge is gonna disappear, so that's why we can't go straight to alpha. Sign, magenta yellow does not make an active gradient. Is that literally the unpleasant gradient meme? Unpleasant gradient shows up at your front door. What do you do? This is not quite yellow. This is magenta. This is not quite cyan. But it's very close. Yeah, exactly. That's my worry as well. So I was thinking of maybe using layer 4 here. Makes it absolutely unambiguous. Dither? Yeah, how does dither look? I'm actually not sure. I agree, dither would look nice. We can check out what dither looks like I think. Let's see. Maybe we find something. Hmm. The hell? You know, modern games tend to have objects that clip in your plane. This was one in 64. Hmm, sure. It's touring complete. Yeah, that doesn't look too bad. It's kinda nice. Kinda like it. Could you imagine if the visuals matched the actual thing you put down? Wouldn't that be awesome? Someone should make a model exporter with that feature. Where's Lilaa? I need to yell at her. Or Bekkar to fix the bug for me. I don't know which one's more efficient. Do you know why we have such a creature? That sounds promising. I am eagerly awaiting it. I'm gonna record all the b-roll for the next video with him. So we're gonna get a bunch of people to see him and be like what the fuck. True, Kyle, I wasn't even thinking of it like that, but you're right. So now we need an arcade button here. There needs to be a button where if you press it, the light bridge comes out. Because I want the player to trigger this. So obviously a very easy choice is to use one of the arcade buttons. And I think it's very fitting. You can probably make them a little bit reflective, a little bit see-through. You're doing cool shit with the N64's cache, I definitely am. Well, most of the cool shit isn't implemented yet. It's just NES. There's three ideas with the cache that I still need to try. Actually, more. The first is in the idle thread. I'm gonna read the instruction cache and the history of which thread ran last, so I can predict the thread that runs next and prefetch instructions into iCache. The second is when sending a task to the RCP, instead of running index and validate over all indices, I will run hit and validate over the last few RAM addresses that could be relevant. It should reduce memory throughput, but it can be CPU cycles, but CPU cycles don't matter. Then in OS level functions, instead of using stack, I'm gonna create a dirty exclusive, a few bytes of cache, and then hit invalidate before flushing them out, so that all the OS level functions can run without ever assessing RAM. There was something else that I forgot. Back to my normal music. Oh yeah, I don't have normal music. Any, any, oh yeah, what, lo-fi, fuck it. You know what, I'm fine with this music. Pfft. Also, walking on your game. The fuck with the walk. For the most reason... It's so bad, Salwar. Dude, Salwar, I figured out FL Studio recently. I set it up for my... Videos, my YouTube videos. So if we do end up doing that stupid romming idea we have, we're gonna make a banger. We're gonna produce some insane shit. You should already... We should already start writing on it. Get a few Big Boos Haunt rhymes out of the way. It's gonna be so funny. Sincerity, that's what I'm looking for in you. Souls that dream alone, they lie awake. If you have a few, like, put them down. Maybe we should make a GitHub repo. If you've been waiting for, falling in need. Babe, you don't have to wait on me. Cause I've been chasing the highs, the thrill of the heat. But a heart like mine... Amigolito. It's going to be beautifully cringed. Don't let me go. Cause you never know just how long our love will grow. If you've been waiting for, falling in need. Babe, you don't have to wait on me. Cause I've been chasing the highs, the thrill of the heat. But a heart like mine... Amigolito. It's going to be beautifully cringed.  Amigolito. It's going to be beautifully cringed. Yes, take a guess who banned me, I'm sure you can come up with who did it. I changed my mind, what are you talking about? I'm starting with M, correct! I think this looks kinda nice for a button. Getting banned from Microsoft Word. Case Dildo Sponsorship, I have been reached out by a dildo company, they wanted pictures of my dicks so they could make dildos after me and sell them to my fans. But so far I've said no, however, we are probably getting a Manscaped Sponsorship. I can talk about my shaved balls on YouTube videos next. Biobak has already given me a bunch of banger lines. So yeah. Who even does that? Shaving their balls? I mean you do have to shave them eventually, right? Otherwise like, you're gonna just have like 2 meters of bald hair, your bald hair is just gonna come back out of your pants at the bottom. I've never seen anyone with bald hair coming back out of their pants, so clearly everyone shaves their balls eventually. I'm not crazy for thinking that, correct? I'm in a space, recount, shellmonty game. We have the stars already planned. The thing is, I don't want too many game games, I want it all more to have the arcade vibe than real arcade games, because I don't know if arcade games really fit the playstyle here. It doesn't grow forever? Oh. Seems like when I'm the guy who shaved his ass and balls, then all the sponsors on YouTube throw down their sponsorship. What? Doesn't all hair grow infinitely? Hello Lunar Festival. Oh yeah, I was busy optimizing my operating system. Hmm, I'm looking for, let's think, let's find this one, this one. I'm gonna make them sound like glass, that's gonna be very dissatisfying. It doesn't stop growing, but it falls out when I reach a certain length. Ah, I see. Okay. Huh, tiny huge island, goddammit. What's up with the flashing question mark block? I don't see a flashing question mark block. Hmm. The ninth bit can actually be used for like insane easter eggs that no one can discover. What if we just store a hidden ASCII message in the hidden bits on boot? That'd be crazy. And like the only way to read it is to dump the RAM from real N64. I love Berne Grayman, Berneford Kinning. I don't know how I originally named that wrong. 191. Make that message link to an in-game easter egg from mindblowing with like 15 years. 15. I'm gonna increase the lettering total, 15. So this is the last one we have to make. Very similar behavior. You change your name? Nice. Oh, I can tell who you are from your little picture. But I didn't know you before! So your name change has no effect on me. You were nobody to me before, you're still nobody to me. What is this? Global Illumination? Blake has done Global Illumination, but it's Blake, so... 11 coming, she's going to Mr. Mario. I'm gonna screenshot that, send it to her, so she will come. I feel like Lilaa will come. She's gonna come now. It's not transparent. And it doesn't fucking move. How is it this terrible? Also, I feel like the intensity on the lens flare didn't really work. Is the texture maybe bad? Okay, so we got who's playing who's playing. I don't want to turn off the ground pound buttons in Mario Galaxy 2. Why do you want me to do that? I don't wanna. It's not misplaced, that's a fast 64 bug and there's literally nothing I can do about it. They don't look good. You made a donut with the tutorial? Oh, I hate the donut tutorial. Ah! Mario's not on the platform? Something's going really weird here. I think I am losing it. What? Oh. It works on the flipper piece, it doesn't work on the arcade button. That's possible, Kriya, and it looks pretty good. But of course, very expensive. I'm trying to think of a single thing in the entire world that would cause this to happen. Nope, I have not made a video about that. It worked once, and then not again. Cool. Is it an object update order problem? I don't think it can be. I think this might be a fast 64 issue. Maybe the collision is exported so inaccurately that, like, I don't know, man. Oh! Because I had the object still in the level. There we go. Let's go! Dori Dori fans and the owners of the 8-Wheelers! We've been waiting for you! It's finally started! Initial D! Initial D! Initial D! I'm gonna get you like a space boy I'm ready babe Gonna get you I think I might need one that has the shine in the top left corner here or in the middle Like a space boy Like you baby Like so Like a space boy Maybe this is what I want Like a space baby Like a space bae This should be made in grayscale How are you gonna get the colors there in grayscale Zeno? If you have an idea on how to get the colors there, then sure, go for it Otherwise, well, I don't see a possibility Okay, there we go, that looks finally good Can you stop asking me dumb fucking questions? Sorry, I was rude The next thing, I can't select my hardware That's funny, I did download it from Google though, so And we're not using that for the end, so Yeah Mario log, it's a me, changelog Oh my god, there's a whole changelog just for Mario Alright guys, prepare to be flashed Biobak said, this model, okay, first of all, 39% reduction, TMEM time, which is amazing And he also said this looks so much better than makes the old Mario model look like a beta model So let's see this Also, old model was 639 triangles Let's see if we reduce that or increase that Okay The eyes, okay, the eyes are very nice, the buttons are very nice Let's see 595 This is 30 triangles less Okay, so this is the one we care about Yeah, I need to close this, this flash is annoying me It's 30 triangles less, which is amazing Let's see, the eyes are in preview mode Okay The overall change is disabled, so you can see the changes better Got it 26, 629, 627 Okay, I guess there's more than one, alright, let's see it Added the old Mario in the file for comparison Alright, total TMEM, 0, 4385 Okay, so 39-40% TMEM usage decrease Updated shoes now with shine and salts Oh my god, look at the shoe shine And the salts That does look insane 8x16 down to 4x16 Let's see the old one, 16x8 16x4, awesome Updated the eyes, all three variations Yeah, these eyes look beautiful No changes for model size, just visual upgrades Thicker eyebrows, shinier shading Oh yeah, and the eyebrows now also use this actual hair color instead of black Updated vertex colors, yeah you can see like In here, there's some nice vertex coloring This one corner here is a little bit weird if you ask me I don't know why it's weird though What's going on here? That seems unintentional Is there no area around the biome back? It's actually a little distracting to me That actually does bother me a little bit Let me see if I can fix it Let me see This might not be easy to fix Trying to understand the geometry here first of all It's pretty complicated With the rest I'll try and fix it, alright Updated sideburns, new design, new texture Yeah, that does look pretty nice 32x64 down to 32x32 Very nice And it's also a CI8, which is the old one too So that doesn't make a difference actually I just know you remapped the correct way It doesn't stretch like crazy Cool, cool Updated overalls and shirt New folds and channels around the legs and ads for extra detail Oh! Yes, there's folds here There's texture here now Folds around the legs and ass? I don't see ass folds, is that maybe... Yeah, I don't know why I'm not seeing them It no longer looks like he's wearing a diaper, which is interesting One 4x16 8x8 for each mat Let's see that Okay, interesting This material is a little crazy Updated buttons on the overalls Yeah, I see These are a lot nicer looking How do they work? What intonation Okay Okay, I need to disable the lighting and everything Because that would be a bit annoying in Fast64 From 16 triangles to 4 Fair enough, honestly Yeah, I was not sure about my end maps either And this looks nicer than the original vanilla buttons So that should be good 32x32CN8 down to 16x16I4 Yeah, I4 makes more sense for this What's the shading on this? x0 multiplied by prim x0 alpha multiplied by prim So these are both the same Okay, so it's just prim multiplied by 2 multiplied by texture And then also multiplied by shade color Okay I need to think about this for a second Okay This is going to look A very small bit weird In CoreOS 4 around the crystals But it should be fine Where prim is good to remove edges in cutout modes Ah, yeah I see what you mean Can now be affected by shade color It wasn't affected by shade color before? Okay, that's a big issue Average filter for small edges Fucking combiner, I hope it works Yeah, this should work Updated gloss Interesting Change geo a little I do have to enable shading, here's where it starts 16 by 8 down to 16 by 4 Cool Interesting So you removed the vertex color part here Which means it works on one cycle now With anti-aliasing, which is very good Do you still want me to use the preview material here or not? I'm guessing I4 I'm guessing not Which is good Yeah, okay, you removed the vertex colors Updated cap The emulogon now has a flatter bottom, like the official design Oh You're right, that looks a lot better Yeah, true, I noticed that too Although we're talking about Mario, that's much better Updated vertex color on the cap New shading on the fold on top Oh, that looks nice Very, very nice I8 down to I4 Okay, fair enough Shouldn't we... Ah It does make a little bit of a difference I guess it does look a little crunchier It's not a big difference No one's gonna see this on N64 And realistically not even in gameplay So it should be fine I'm just thinking about it If I can somehow make this better Cause... We don't need all the alpha levels And we don't need all the shading levels, right? Oh One can be replaced by shade color, I think And this can be replaced by primal, not by shade So, what if... Prim Zero Shade Zero Prim Zero Combine alpha Shades Combined Combined And one Um Eh, what the fuck Why is it doing this? What have I done? Not what my plan was What do you think? It doesn't quantize, that's the problem Okay, nevermind, we'll just use yours My idea did not work But even if there's a problem with the old one, there's not a problem I just thought maybe I could get these edges here to be a little smoother By giving us more alpha levels But I don't think so Updated wings Remove alpha distinct on the vector, yeah, fair enough Distribute alpha on point, remove the edges and smooth it out Oh, that looks very smooth Ah, yes I see what you mean Make some edges sharp to help with the shading Oh, yeah, that looks... yeah, yeah, I should have thought of that I should have thought of that Move the screen square-protuding ass, sorry People are going to be so upset about this You have no idea That's the one thing I think is most controversial here Still looks like a creature, that is true He looks very good He's gonna look insane Too bad for them, fair enough Maru's ass got nerfed, true There was one thing you wanted to fix, right? The thing at the front here Let me know when that's done so I can import him Import it now, I'm not sure it can be fixed Well, there's a bunch of other changes I need to make Like, all the flags need to be set correctly So, it's... Something I guess I can just copy the UV mapping from yours in the end I guess I can just copy the UV mapping from yours in the end He did the blend colour thing correctly, that's good Is this supposed to be slightly different? Or is it supposed to be the same? I think it's supposed to be the same I think Okay, with this one I think it's not worth to use the custom blend mode And I don't think you changed this one anyway, right? Let me just keep that on my mustache Okay, yeah, this one was set to R59 The other one was set to R60 So it's like a difference of one unit  I'm also just gonna do that I'm also just gonna do that Or does the 3d one look that much better?  Nah, it actually looks better Like it hello filipuccino hope you like the video yeah i want to make sure that the van colors on all of them wait wait this doesn't use the vertex colors anymore we don't need the vertex colors on all on here or do you still want the vertex colors on this file back i think you wanted them removed good good good good good that makes my life so much easier torture i mean fixing the model was my previous model that bad and you call it broken dang bro that's rude it's actually pretty good that these aren't a cutoff layer because that means that the duplicate material load here might not happen you should choose preview can go as well and these are one cycle now fully through Biobak i could tell with this fucking thing on the overworld but you know what game studios would never understand they'll never let us do this they'll be like just use a 32x32 please look at the shu ue map this is i mean the soul seems pretty reasonable interesting and then what is this the bottom part where does this vertex belong to i mean yeah you would not be allowed to do this in the game studio that still seems pretty doable we don't need this anymore and we can set this to one we don't need blend color on this anymore and we don't need blend color anymore all right now just this one here still has the course technique applied can i somehow remove the course technique from this i'd love to be able to remove the course technique from this did i look at the mustache okay mustache is good this is good just double checking ah this also still uses the course technique yeah i'd love to be able to do this without using the course technique open the cyber text on the internet and ruin the surprise all right let's see it oh huh we don't actually need the apply on here do we we couldn't just why are these rgba 16s couldn't they also be ci8s yeah okay so what i'm thinking is instead of using the primitive color here we just use text zero and then we can just multiply text zero by shade color alpha and then multiply that by shade color and then we are rid of the course technique entirely except for the hat but let me think about that afterwards what do you think Biobak do you see any different any issue with that hello cake honka honka i mean yeah but we do want it to be like in the style of mod 64 oh so it was like a nutsack reference i wasn't sure whether i was supposed to point out the nutsack reference or not i have Lilaa eye zero i have mario cock ice shit ntl is in dick then i have mario eyes closed and then i have ray march i attempt five it looks like you want me to use the new eye zero one and new eye two and new eye three though snows in this game has a jiggle bone so respect that that is so annoying man looks to be the same colors though so that's good i just wanted to know how many colors there are in here no it is an option maybe except there's only an option if there's less than 256 which fair enough so Biobak remember how you set how much extra space you saved look at this four zero nine six and two zero four eight you need to add um five and twelve to this though that was two zero four eight though really it showed us four zero nine six on here because it was rgba 16 instead of ci8 it should still be able to like show that there's 300 colors in my opinion you might have i mean had they been ci8 there would have been 256 colors so i would have i don't think it matters because like there were a few more colors but like there's no visual difference so like who cares now these are n64 textures oh right now it's not lerping to the desired color anymore which is completely fine because that's what we want right this is actually kind of true but i mean if it defaulted to rgba 16 then it probably was not fine did i do the cyber texture i did not this should not be an index color um because this one would actually be bigger as a ci8 it would not be big as a ci8 i mean which is insane why does he have eye shadow good question i don't know i think you know what perfect one second leader snaps bulb what you prefer the new eyes that's very good bro why is everyone making fun of firebag's ballsack texture it is what it is man this is what nintendo did nothing we can do we're just being faithful their colosseum is gonna be so happy to know that anti-aliasing works again he's like the go to so i don't know what's going on with this eye shadow thing i found out what was going on with the eye shadow thing yeah sometimes when you 3d model bender the vertex normals get fucked and that's what happened here the vertex normal there must have been like pointing up or something so it was getting way too much shade color now about the head so this is what it looks like i'm done right now this is what it will look like in game but when we do that we lose anti-aliasing so we don't want that shift alt s what does that do i'm scared your mom hit shift alt s at the all you can eat buffet yesterday this has always been that big how was the set to individual origins all right um how do we do this we need to lerp to black dependent shade color alpha and we also need to lerp into repet depending on this texture's color it's rough we can replace this with shade color but then primitive doesn't get multiplied by shade color we need to multiply the whole thing by shade color alpha and we need to lerp between the two so what i don't understand why did my previous plan not work let me try that why does shade color here texture alpha here combine color alpha combine color combine color brim shade why did this not work it doesn't work Why did it not work before? Looks like a mix between N64 and Gamecube Mario. This model has 170 triangles less than 64 Mario. And it has smaller textures than N64 Mario. This model here is lower poly and lower resolution than the original Mario model. And it has smaller textures than the original Mario model. What is the correct response? This would make a banger to the post. Okay, but... Seriously, we need to... ...get this guy... ...multiple pixel color alpha. ...multiple pixel color alpha. ...multiple pixel color alpha. No matter how I think about this, the only way this is possible is if we turn this into a color texture. It would be a lot more expensive. Also, someone just turned itself into an I8. We're starting to... ...laking for the high detail of the textures. Do you think rising up triangles for rounding it? Did you just have a stroke before writing that? Or did I have a stroke before reading that? Are we speaking the same language? What the fuck is going on here? Maybe the geometry... ...as in the triangles... ...is starting to laking for the high detail of the textures. Did you think rising up the triangles for rounding it? Huh? I don't get it. The preview material is missing... ...shade color, let's see. Sorry, I'm Spanish, don't worry about it. But I do not understand. Hmm. No matter how I think about this, this is not possible. And I don't like it. I don't like that this is not possible. Well... Do I have a question? How many sides will you mod? Nine. I think it will need to be cursed. You might feel it. But I haven't given up hope yet. No, that's just two multiplications. And the lerp. And the lerp is... But it's two-sided, shouldn't this technically be possible? Alpha coverage selection. That's coverage for alpha. We only need to do this once. But... ...but...   Okay, what if... What happens if we do this? This is the anti-aliasing cycle. And then we set this to shade color alpha. Do we get anti-aliasing? I'm not sure. I guess I have to try it. Okay. I think it is possible. That's the thing. I'm scared it's gonna break something. I would not be surprised if Mario looks completely wrong now. But that's probably due to my C code. Alright. It looks mostly alright. A few small issues. It looks very detailed. I don't know what went wrong with the blue... ...the gloss here. What is this? What is this TI setting here? Oh, I see. You meant to do that. Thank you for the sub, NevaRant. Is that satisfactory for the gloss pileback? Okay. Nosebone? He has a nosebone. You can see it when I jump. It just feels like something around his butt is missing. You know what I mean? It's like all the same color. It's like it's glowing the same color. Other than that, this is awesome. Guess we have to do a lightning text. I don't know.     Didn't enable... Oh! That would explain... ...why his shirt and pant look wrong. Shit, now he's in CC. He can disable a lightning. Oh, shit! I see, so these need to be two cycles. No other way of doing it. That's fine. Oh yeah, that is much better. Nice. Look at him, dude. Oh my god, this is so nice. Yeah, this is insane. Wait, his shoes look like they're glowing. His shoes are missing light. There we go. Alright, his shoes are real now. He needs a butt crease. Honestly, I like it a little bit of gray. His shoes no longer glow. Only graphics in 2030. Dude, this looks so insanely good. Oh my god. I'm gonna send this to Lila. Lila's gonna be so sad. Patreon screenshot. That would be an insane screenshot for Patreon. Butt crease. Okay. So, I know Biobak didn't want a butt crease. But I feel like... ...he wouldn't mind... ...if I just...  ...added just a little bit of a butt crease. You know? Just a tiny bit. Just a tiny bit. Just increase the existing butt crease. I was thinking of just putting a dark line here. It's very difficult to see what I'm doing. How did Bromodel like this? Okay, so that's the bottom vertex. And then...      Then this is... ...the left vertex. And this is the middle vertex. Got it. So... That's the right vertex. This is the middle one. Oh, but it's not the same on both. But they look like I can just do whatever I want here. So... This one here, I can... Oh, and that's a bit of shading like that. I see. Check this out.  And this. And this. But wouldn't that remove the shading at the bottom? I kinda don't wanna get rid of the shading part here. No, don't worry. But I worry.  It looks bad. Oh, you mean... Just increase this ass shading here? Like so? I don't know. I think what we're missing is... ...this part here at the top. On top of the ass, not on bottom of the ass. I think that's too dark actually. I'd rather get this butt shading here. This costume. And this is just a normal Mario. And I made it white so I can see better. This part of the picture seems good. I don't think it's a mean detail. I think it's a legitimate detail that is worth it. I like that. Like that a little bit. Kinda. Not quite. I think it's too dark still. Okay. How do I make this light, though? Without making it glow. I think this might be what it has to be. I don't know. Let's check it out in the game. Maybe it's not as bad as I think it is. It's hard to tell that it even exists, I actually can't tell that it exists at all. But that might be an emulator bug, with such small UV coordinates emulator inaccuracies can quickly just become a problem. Yeah the head obviously also doesn't look as intended. It looks like an artifact to you more than anything intended, damn. But it's not even visible in game, I don't understand that part. But yeah also the head is wrong. No, it just says that on N64 it can't just be the emulator anymore. What's this? Color? Glendapla. Alpha-M? Is that a framebuffer for alpha? That can't be right, right? Has to be 1-I. Do I not know how opacity works? Oh, opaque works. I think the bottom button could be a little lower, if that makes any sense. Gives me an illusion that I have some horizontal sausage butt. What kind of throws me off is that this side here seems to be darker than the other side. But they are the same, so that doesn't make any sense. No wait, they're not the same. Why is there a difference here? No wait, they are the same. Why do they look different? Maybe it's the lighting? Yeah, that's the lighting direction. I don't know, it doesn't make any sense. I don't know, it is what it is. Can you even face animations like when he gets hurt when it's a star? I can. Dude, I must be completely misunderstanding how this works. Yeah, alpha, man. What are the options here? 1-M-A? I guess it has to be this, right? Color in. Alpha in. Color memory. Alpha memory. Okay, well. I have a feeling this won't look good, but let's try it. Okay. His cheeks look too high. You mean his buttcheeks? I love turning on the N64. It's my favorite thing ever. Especially when it needs, like, free tries. That's what I thought. There's no way this is right. What the hell? Completely deffed. Let's see.  RD def. Coverage test clamp. Coverage test region is clamp. Zmod alpha. Alpha coverage select. Which one's that? Coverage x alpha? That's not it. So just use coverage for alpha. It just feels like there's no way this is right. But this is apparently the render mode that alpha means. Someone just can't make any sense out of it right now. Yeah, it's just so clearly not right. I don't know, man. I'm just going to try the thing that makes sense to me and see if that works. Okay, so using coverage for alpha does that. Which makes sense. What the f- This isn't even making sense. Wait, what if I... I need one disable ID, let me see. Oh. Fair enough. Bro has the fire fragment. Am I stupid? How does that genie thing work? This can't be. This can't be happening. What if I look at something that we know how it works? BLAN, then it's render alpha in. Is it force blending option that maybe ruins this? It doesn't make any sense, though. Why would this work? There's no possible way this could ever work. I am losing it. Pennsylvania nose trigger. I have one clip of it being very intense on Twitter. But it doesn't look good for obvious reasons. Why does turning on the N64 have to be such a torture every single time? Honestly, it doesn't look as wrong as I thought it would. This makes sense if it's going to blend color here. The question is if we can turn these around. Like so. And then use the cycle to alpha as the combined color alpha. I have to get this to work. This is the first time here I am feeling somewhat hopeful that it might work. Yeah, Mari's nose is very jiggling. You can literally just crouch and it will jiggle. This Mario model is going to be my first 1 million viewer video that Nintendo doesn't take down. Maybe, hopefully. Please just put... Put the game, please. I want to look at Mario. How do speedrunners not run into this problem? Well, I was hopeful and I was very disappointed. I think we have to call this impossible. Unless maybe force blending being after this? I don't know man, I have no idea what I am doing. I don't even really know what force blending is. What the fuck is Cloner Alliance? It's my capture card. Okay. It is not working. Wait a second. Wait a goddamn second. We are using an i4 texture for his head. We could save all of this pain here by just adding 32 bytes of data to the texture. And you know what? I am doing it. I am adding 32 bytes. Wait. Oh, this has another disadvantage. And that is Call of Duty. But I don't care anymore. We are doing this. This will be a little bit annoying to implement, but it's fine. We already indexed this to stick to Kalos Biobak. That makes my job so easy. Why don't we just... Yeah. What am I trying to make? Let me look at the original code. Right, this part is white. Okay.        There we go. This is what we are trying to make. And this is 16 colors. 217. Is this the black outline? Is this the black outline? Is this the black outline? Really? There is an outline, but I don't think it's black. It looks between red and white. Did I do it wrong? Is this what we want? This is what we want. I mean, I agree with you that that wasn't a black outline. I just have a low perception skill. I mean, I agree with you that that wasn't a black outline.  Okay. We did it. We did it, guys. It's over. Nah, it looks way better without the outline, if you ask me. Mariko's HD? He's not HD, he's lower res than the vanilla model. Well, not lower res, but... He's cheaper to render. Thank you for allowing me to make the Mario model higher quality.  Very nice of you to increase my polygon budget, mom. This reminds me of when I was a kid. My parents would be like, your allowance is 10 euros a month. And then it's like, can I have more allowance? And then they're like, no, you have never used your allowance for anything. You just want to save up more money. And that's how I feel about the polygon budget, too. Okay, I know it looks fucked, but don't worry about that. That's a C++ problem. Oh my god, he's... It's beautiful so, okay, you may have noticed me struggling with making the M work, and I have settled on a different solution, this solution is possible, unlike the other solution, which is not possible, but this solution has a disadvantage, and that is that now we need to change all 16 colors of mario's hat when mario gets a different cap, we edited the old tech track that explodes, I don't think I did, this one here, right, mario logo 2, that's the one I edited, I didn't edit mario logo rgba 16.png, it was this one, that's the one you wanted, right? I don't think 64ds mario looks anything like this, 64ds mario had like a fabric and shit okay let's see, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, still works, set her color, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, okay, we actually saved the instruction here, the texture has the flat bottom, that's missing here, but then where did the texture go? you're right that your texture looks a lot better, but where did it go, it's not in here, can you send it to me and then I can just do the same edit to that one, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, perfect, we don't need to set the blend color anymore, and there's no pink color here, nice, and extract it from the preview cap material, mario logo 2, it's, that's the texture, you're gonna delete this texture, and then write file to current directory, it just looks different here, what the fuck, yeah it's just exporting this one here, this is a blender bug, it can't do this for some reason, can you just send me the texture please, okay, so now we have the problem that we have a dynamic palette for mario's head instead of a color, so instead of setting one color we now need to HSV shift the entire palette to the new color, this is going to be a little fucked up, cause it is stored as a red texture, so we wanna keep the S and we wanna keep the V but we wanna change the H, that's all I needed to know, that's all you needed to say, HSV shift the texture, you only need to change the H, we need to back this up somewhere, where's a good place to back this up, guys I'm not just adding fingers to the hands, makes no sense, send it, thank you very much, right I was thinking for a good place to store this, group 0.c, fuck it, oh I already did that, mario's head, somebody's redoing mario's model again, okay look, sonic, are you telling me to do this, I'm doing it, I'm doing it, I'm doing it, I'm doing it, I'm doing it, what's our standard HSV value, it's 2550 and 0.9, RGB to HSV online, RGB to HSV online, not fucking none, oh my god, shut up, 258, that's like 254, ER equals go minus current so R minus 2.5, 2554, G, well actually it's DHDS, G minus 2.5, and group D, group B, group D, group B, group B, group D, group D, so the saturation should go to 0 now, H equals max to 0, minus the H, and then remaining 8 by 5, and that's V, that's V, that's V, you do not need to rewrite this to only use a point dash, I mean that would be nice, but like multiple part, which is capitalized, something like that, okay, there we go, now we just need to undo the palette switching thing, so this equals, fuck, are these scaled to 250, they are scaled to 255, so we actually need to do math on all these numbers here, multiply by 21, that should be allowed to do, how's this not infinite, press 4, oh, that's fine, am I not using the spark for anywhere, can you fix, can you fix the buttons lighting, um, I have to look into that separately, let me fix this first, and then I can look at that, so let's see, how did this work, um, image mode, nope, wait, we just need this to be a gradient between white and, oh, red color, right, okay, which part of Mario's M is red, the inner part, and the outer part, so all the black parts need to be red, so we invert this, we add a mask, we take this as the mask, we put this here, and then FF0009, okay, that explains why the color code was running before, wait, wait, okay, all right, this should do it, okay, what happened to his arms, why are his arms white,  oh, that means it worked, okay, so we'll know it works if his head, oh, actually, no, we won't work, no, it works still, do we have anything that changes Mario's cap color, so this still works, the buttons are still glowing a little bit, but it's not really that noticeable, it might be not noticeable under red light, maybe, yeah, you can see, kind of, that they glow, yeah, I think this zoom has a change for Mario's hat, right here, yeah, but I think this is using the main Mario brain functions instead, What about the ice cap? The ice cap should work. That's how we know whether what I just wrote works or not, with the ice cap. Clown Cap sure does look so good. That's surprising, that's a really old texture. I didn't think it was anything special. Ah, right, that's what it does. Okay, do we even have anything that, like, sets Mario's cap color? Maybe I can hijack the makeMarioGrey function. Oh. Okay, so setRedColor does not work. Interesting. This is an issue. I swapped the variable names. Well, that won't do it. I think the only way we actually have to adjust this function is right here. And it does not work, but it removes the M. It made the whole thing red. I think using individual fingers when you're not gonna move them in the game is silly. Okay, this is my official statement here on this map. So, H would be 255. That's fine. S should be zero. Oh, wait. That's probably why. It was adding the saturation, so it was making everything super saturated instead of desaturating it. And does it reset? Let's go. Almost first try. Nice. All right, what were we missing? The button lighting. That's the one thing that arguably could be improved. Okay, this is a tough one. Excuse me. Probably, but I mean, at that point, I would just switch the whole texture. I just wanted to make sure that my function here works, so that's secondary to me right now. Zero, bi-primitive. X0 alpha, bi-primitive, multiviper shades. Make it appear more shiny. I mean, shiny is fine, but it actually uses the light influence less than the other light so far, so it doesn't look shiny at all. It just looks glowing. So, remove the M. Yeah, but that's fine. And just set the saturation of the M to zero. It did not take the brightness into account, it seems, but... Okay, this is fucked up, because like, why is the value of pure red 100 percent? I don't like that. I guess that's just an issue with the HSV model. Can I just use the thing you did for the star over there and shine? It's not a good idea. Let's put it that way. Okay, question. Would you be okay with... ...something like this? Mr. Biobak. Oh, why is there a purple outline? I guess it would be like this. It's not so pretty. Oh wait, why is it combine color with shade color, and then combine color again? I don't think we need that. Bright yellow highlight. Let's look at the vanilla Mars, it's fun. It's very yellow. You gotta feel the dance, it's always in your heart. Feeling the time to come, beat out the rising sun. I wanna feel your heart, the power of the sun. Clouds are not brighter. This is improvable somehow. You haven't been to the top. What if you actually make it reflective like this? You gotta go and leave town. Back on the rocks, back on the rocks, baby. You gotta keep your mind together. Back on the rocks, back on the rocks, baby. You gotta go and live forever. Okay, I guess adding shade color like that is not a good idea. Back on the rocks, it means you've been to the top. Just listen to the bad boy, give him the back door. It can be all gone, in the beginning you get crazy. Spending all the money you got, no more will to love you now. You gotta go and leave town. It is a pure i4, so we can... Back on the rocks, baby. You gotta keep your mind together. Do that without issue. We can use combine color alpha here. Yes, we can use combine color alpha here. Shade color here. This will make it shiny. Alright, I think that's getting there. Back on the rocks, back on the rocks, baby. I think this is good. And now they should no longer be glowing, but they should be shiny. Because now the lighting has double influence on it. So this will make it look reflective, I think. And they look very close to the vanilla ones. Beautiful. Yeah, I love this new model. Beautiful. And you can see his little butt crease now. Oh, you see his butt crease? Let's go. He has a butt crease. Awesome. Why is this crystal green? Wait, is this crystal green? Am I crazy? Yeah, this is yellow. It looks green to me. Did I make this one green on accident? I was planning on making a decal Mario. That's like the metal Mario, but transparent. So that I can render effects like that. But it was gonna be for damage. Looks yellow to you? It looks so green to me. I'm just making sure. I think it's green. The crystal is orange. It should be less green than yellow. Yes, green LMAO, I'm just messing with you. Here it says orange slash yellow. It's green! What are you talking about? Who's texting me on the grams? Hold on, purple? I swear, as soon as this loads and we see the RGB values, you will be so surprised. FFAFF0 That's... wait, what? That's not what I was expecting. That is this color here. How can that be? That is absolutely not the color I'm seeing. MFB227  How is this happening to me? Try another color of crystal in the game. Yes. Wait. This one is clearly green. Uh, yellow. What color is that one? FFAFF40 It's the same color. What? Huh? Okay, but it works here. Why is it wrong here? Is it overpowered by this one here maybe? Let me check. Uh... FFAFF30 FFAFF20 FFAFF40 FFAFF20? Okay, what if I set this to FFAFF40? I'm gonna get to the root of this. This is the behavior, by the way. What if there's just so many lights that the object order makes it so that the last light can't be added and then all we see is green lights? Colorblind says, I am not colorblind! What do you mean? I'm being gaslit. 48 multiplied by 20 plus 1200 Multiplied by 2, 3360. That seems gigantic. I think I'm just being hit by so many crystals that we can't perceive this one here. I think there are new Yoshi games like Yoshi World and Crafty World. I think I played Worldy World, that was fun. I wish the multiplayer mode was good. The problem with the multiplayer mode is that you can't see what's going on.   It said it's always waiting on the slowest player and I don't like that. Multiplayer modes in video games should always be going as fast as the fastest player, not the slowest one. I can swear you said you were in a stream the other week, but maybe that was somebody else. No, I'm not colorblind. Not even close. I just have a low perception stat. Sometimes. It's still green here. It's still green. I mean, this one makes sense that it's green there. This one makes it yellow. There's definitely an issue with too many concurrent lights being on Mario. I think that's the issue really. The problem with that light source is that we can only add like five of them to Mario, I think. Yeah. But this should be fine in X3 if we set it to seven. So let's test on N64 if this is an issue with too many concurrent lights or if something is at play. Okay. Guys, you should just suffice it to say that I am not colorblind. You do not have to worry about that. No! No! I think the VFX particles there caused an RCP crash. Okay, you know what? It works. I'm sure it works. This is not even what we wanted to test right now. This doesn't map up. We know the new Mario model works. It looks awesome. I'm happy with it. That's the takeaway from today's stream. We did not make too much progress on these actors here. We were supposed to make the light bridge today. But that's fine. We made other good progress. Unfortunately, I have to leave you guys today already. Me and Zayna have an appointment today at her parents'. I'll see you later. Bye bye!
