Hello. I completely forgot I did that. It's been so long that anyone pointed that out. Well, it's about your big loser, bro. On a business day again? Yep, Lila, yep. I have officially lost my mind. I am actually working. On my major hack. What is going on? I don't expect...  That was Sonic Adventure reference. What? That's a Sonic Adventure reference? No way. I would get it if it was a Sonic Adventure reference. No respect for hardworking Americans? Sure, I respect them a lot. Hello, Alast. I'm going to run Strygon to update the Upgrader UI to get it to update correctly. You want to upgrade the Upgrader UI just so I upgrade correctly? Hey man, if I'm getting it wrong, I'm sure everyone's getting it wrong. Hello, I'm your cat. Yes, he pissed me off a lot. Well, okay, but there's no way I'm dumber than the average Fast64 loser. So if I'm doing it wrong, everyone must be doing it wrong. Whenever I send someone to read this, they read it. Uh-huh. Hello, Mia. Hello, Tomasas. Just want to make sure this is a proper multiple of 500, and it is. This doesn't have to be a multiple of 500. Do you think I can even have this without everything fucking breaking? 1, 2, 8, 7, 2, divided by 500, 25.744. Man, it's all boxed in and gone, and nothing has come up. Hello, Ricardo. So what I did off-stream was give everything some basic uv-mapping. I think we got this Brick Serena too now. That's decent to me. I want to clarify, I'm in PR for the upgraded changes. I didn't just like ask him. Oh, I see. So it looks like there's a chance that I'm going to get a mystery box gifted from some weeb gift shop thing. And they want me to just give away some stuff, so wouldn't that be nice? Okay, let's prove that. Isn't that the button I clicked before? I don't get it. I missed a beast. One million missed a beast. Is there a preference? Do you have any performance tips about generating multiple animation matrices for multiple entities in a frame? Do it all in one go, so it's instruction cache? I don't know. I only know N64 stuff. I don't know what console you're on. Use quaternions? True. If only we had quaternions. My parents are visiting us in Germany right now, and it's quite a bit of work. My dad decided that we're setting up the automatic lawnmower today, and I've been working in the garden for like three hours. Hello, Davey. You know what I'm going to do? I'm breaking the barrier. Nope, never heard of it. Nice 8-bit dandy. Dude, how is this broken? I'm learning quaternions when you work on reading the update or readme. Honestly, that's a fair deal. I'm up for it. There's no readme on here. Someone from Mario Nova? Oh, no idea what Nova is doing. Hello, guys. Hello, chat. This weekend is the Zevent. So I have four streams open at once, like some kind of 10-year-old Zoomer. It's the Zevent. You told me to read the readme, but there was nothing. Hello, YoshiNamedCase. I wonder if I'm out of memory. Awkward. What if I use Nemu to find the crutch? I see a frame of the level.  I see a frame of the level. I don't know what an FPGA is. The macro code is uploaded to the RSP. You run it. You compute all the triangles. It's a very small bit of code. It's directly in there, so it's really fast. It's still crashing? How can this be? I just removed too many collision triangles. If this doesn't fix the crash, it's not collision triangles. That's AmaraBuilder. Cool, but useless. You're from Beckenheim, right? In the office, it's 1995. Pardon the programming team. What do you change or do differently? The first thing I do is fix the graph render code. Make it all fit into one block of cache. And now the entire game runs at 30 FPS. And we can add Luigi to the game. And it's going to be two days of work. And then Luigi works. And then Miyamoto is going to say... Arigato gozaimasu. And the world is saved. How is it crashing still? Yes. It's one of the actors that's crashing. What the fuck? What the fuck? 1056 for updater? Too complicated. I don't understand. Oh I know what the issue is. What the fuck man. This should work now. Ok so now we need to press the main button instead of video logon. Ok so now we need to press the main button instead of video logon. Favorite color Yoshi? I'm not sure. My parents, they came over 2 days ago, they're gonna stay for 10 days. They brought like 15 Yoshis. I have so many Yoshi plushies now. You guys wouldn't believe that entire thing behind me. Look at this. Can you see it? Oh god I have so much stream delay, I don't know. I hope you saw it. That's a shit ton of Yoshis. Alright Lila, I'll try it. Edit, preferences, 64. Check for update and install main. Alright, alright. I see. Your room looks like a sauna. It's not a sauna. What is N64DD stuff? Give me an example. We win dude, this is a virus. What's the problem?  Node emulation? Like GeoNodes? I don't know. From R64? I'm sure it's gonna be done any second now. Shader nodes? What is a shader node? I've understood why N64 games run worse than PS1 games. Bad programming. Let's go left. My first weight training was today in a related college. You lost 2 pounds in one day. That is quite a myth. That does not sound real. Oh, I see. You can preview X3 features. That makes a lot more sense. If this doesn't export anymore, I will be so upset. Why didn't Lina hide the level exporter? Oh, here. Hey, BBJ on break. Calling Raycast physics, it doesn't convey the incredible power of the change. For my physics changes? Yeah. Maybe. Watching in Biopass right now? Nice. Should still crash. Yeah. I need to find which object does the crash. Yeah, it's hard to say Mario 64 looked good when like Spyro came out and it looks better. Bioglass. There's so many words with bio I can just throw in to get Biobak's attention. I had to take out the bio and smash today. Today's project getting the UVs for the walls to look half decent. And then after that, it's time for the retro section. Don't you have a crash? Can I do? The reason the textures look like shit is probably because the upgraded materials are more efficient. I got three whole months of it long for having a child. But also, I need to work more because I want to make more money. So that's why I'm gonna just stream like basically every day now. Because I'm very efficient working on stream. It defaulted to F3D? Don't tell me it was already F3D before. Don't tell me. I bet it's one of those coin formations here crashing. Coin formations love to crash. Full version of Xmas? No, full version tomorrow, Tanya, just for you. Yeah, it is one of the coin formations. Yeah, the expansion pack is used here. It makes everything a little easier. The pipes are green. It's just that the light is missing in the overworld, which is why they appear black, but they are green. People settings, where are they? Okay, I'm gonna remove the three coin formations and then make sure it works. Yeah, so which one of these coin formations is that? Minus 6651 is one of them. Oh, wait, that's a freezie. Minus 4001, that is one of them. Minus 5008, that's not one I have noted down anywhere. Is it this one? Minus 6001. There's one at minus 6651. 5008, 6651. Aha! This was the cause for the crash. I thought I had the top of these already done. Am I literally insane? I remember having done these. Oh, because I projected everything. These are no longer done. Fuuuuck. I just undid a lot of work. Why would I not test on Project64? What do you want me to test on? You know what, that was ugly anyway. Project64 boots fast and it works, that's why. You have to name any alternative to Project64 and I will tell you in two seconds why it doesn't work. Since Clash Royale Final Game is finished, you should put a small minigame in the crash game, like the Chrome Dinosaur game or Breakout. The Chrome Dinosaur game was actually planned for the crash game, but it will be with Yoshi. Movement doesn't do 60 FPS, it just doesn't work. And Parallel doesn't work at all. Nothing in Parallel works. Every time you open Parallel, you get 16 pop-ups. I don't know if you can see it, but it's a new version of Project64's emulator.  Nope. But it's inaccurate enough to work on emulator. This uses Gliden, which is not 20 years old. Gliden has been updated just last year. And it's gonna be updated for X3 as well. So it will be the only way to play this. Parallel will literally never work. It is forever doomed. Let's see. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 12, 13, 14, 15. 16, 17. It's one more leader. Well, if they had Gliden and Parallel, I'm sure you could use Parallel too. I don't know if they do. I think there was a time when they had it. But for some reason that version was broken or something. I no longer remember. I want nothing to do with Parallel if I can avoid it. And this point Parallel is like my own personal PC point. You know what I mean? I wonder if we can make this 75% of the size. Is there anything that says we can't do 75% of the size? Nope, I think it should work. Let's try it. Someone doesn't know anything. Probably because I can't do basics. Well, let's not do basics anymore. The thing is, every emulator is broken as fuck. It's just that I've been using this emulator because this one is the easiest one to use. And it has the best usability features. And I work around the bugs in this emulator. If I wanted to support a second emulator, I would have to also work around all the bugs in that emulator. So for me, I just have to pick one emulator and run with it. Parallel is Glide64, but Parallel in general is ass. No, it needs GlideN64, not Glide64. Glide64 is unusable. Your Project64 vulnerability is only an issue if you are playing a game that exploits the vulnerability. So if someone is playing your game, you don't need to warn them. Unless you put a virus in your game and you want to warn them from the virus that you put in the game. Alright, I think the main area is fine for me. These little blobs of like whatever. Doesn't matter. Shut up, I will be mining Bitcoin on the idle thread. You might as well give back something to me, you know. Dude, that actually, generally, we could do that. We could mine Bitcoin in the idle thread while you're playing the game. So, we're thinking Mario Land 1 for the 8-bit pipe. Which level do we take? Egypt?  Wait, are you telling me there's just 12 levels in this game? There's no way there's just 12 levels in this game. Alright, which block do we pick? I don't think I want the desert. Haha. There's a space level. Or two. One of these underground sections honestly wouldn't be so bad. I mean, there's a spaceship here. Did I figure what out? It would be kind of lame to do a basic platforming level. Yeah. Hmm. I don't know if I want to put Mario Land 2. I want to put Mario and the spaceship though. It seems so different. Hmm. Hmm hmm. Heath is kind of nice. Settings? Oh, I didn't look for them. These here? Why is it so slow?  Please stop crashing. Hmm. No! How long does this take? No! Wait, why did I switch these two? Hmm. Haha. What are you even doing? I'm swapping layer 5 and layer 6, because I swapped them on my repo. These have to be swapped. In every level. Yeah. I've permanently swapped the draw layers. No, I didn't mean to put the 2 there. Are you streaming because you lost your job? You can't draw these back to front, right? So transparent stuff is most of the time above the decals. Is that stupid? These map to the... These map to the... These don't map to the E now. This doesn't map to layer transparent. This maps to 5. This doesn't map to layer transparent. Or do they actually map to the enum? To map to the enum, we have to turn it back around. Okay, if they map to the enum, name them like the enum. Please. Why are these not named after the enum? They map to the enum. God damn it. Alright, let's undo this. Why does this take so long? No. I'm gonna scream at you. I'm gonna scream at you. Why aren't they named right? Oh, you renamed them? Perfect. That's very nice. Okay. Which Mario level do we need? This is not my fault. Is it, Lilaa? You are going to bed with no socks on for the next week. Something in my hair makes sense. To the Moai level? This one? But this is just basic platforming, right? We have to get this right. The idea will make a big difference here. To Mario Land 2 and better. We're doing Mario Land 1. We already did Mario Land 2. We already did Mario Land 2. And it's a good thing that we've already done Mario Land.             And then I have one planned where it's just a gauntlet of Mario 64 levels. Kind of. That's literally it. We're completely out of ideas for retro games. Unless we wanna do Wrecking Crew or something. Mark Payne would be fun with a Space Casino Arcane level. It was planned for the Papercraft level. Dr. May, we have to climb up the falling blocks. That could also work. But I'm a bit worried about the camera. Yoshi's Story was planned at some point but was scratched because it's unfitting. We're in course 13. So the Space Arcade and the Papercraft level are the last two. I don't like this song. I'm trying to think. I couldn't find it, Lilaa. Is this where the repo settings are? Oh, here. I don't know. Oh, nice. Libratio? I'm an X2. Eh, X3. Yeah, this is pretty nice, Lilaa. I like this a lot. I don't know. What about a Lost Levels Maze Retro Repo at the end with some extra difficult levels? I kinda like the Mario 64 Retro Level. Super Mario Land 3, Mario Land type Retro Level. Didn't that come out after Mario 64? Oh, it was 1994. I guess that works too. But I really want Mario Land 1. That works too, Biobak, yeah? Still, I want Mario Land 1. There's no way around it. We just gotta pick an idea to base it off of. Now, there is the option of the submarine levels or the space levels. But I'm not sold on it. Cause I'm not... It's too different, I think. I don't know.  Why not doing anything that released after Mario 64, maybe? That's the rule. We want it to fit in the time. I think sub-level would be fun. This one? Hmm. I don't know.    How would we do this? Like a rail shooter? You'd be watching like this and you're going into the screen. And you're moving around. In the 2D plane. Pressing A to shoot. Yeah, that's what I was thinking too. How do these submarine levels work? Mario Land 2 or 3? I don't know.  We have to make front sprites for everything then. I don't want to make front sprites for everything. SMLDX, let's see what that is. SMLDX.  It's a ROM hack. I don't think I want to make front sprites for all these. Cause I won't even be able to. Budget cuts. Now we're definitely doing the whole thing in black and white. That's essential to the aesthetic. The sound. I'm also still not sold on the submarine. That kind of feels like against the purpose of these sections. I want them to be like all platforming. I think this level here translates very, very well. Another level done? Yeah, I'm thinking this one. This seems very easy to do. SMOE, it does. This song. Boing. One second, I'm looking for the right person here. One second. He skipped the song? No, no, no, no. This is banger. Oh, I can't find him. You guys know the guy that's like completely on steroids and he's wearing like a Joker mask. And he's pretending to go insane at the gym. That's like what I'm thinking about when I hear the song. Absolute cringe. No, I'm taking this one here. It's coming up in a week. 9-11? I want it to be anything but a worse SML2 level. I mean, yeah, fair, but like it is an important retro game, right? We have to cover this. We can't just not cover this. We covered all the 2D Mario games except this one if we don't. Same thing, but less interesting. I don't think so.  Like the vehicle sections. But they're just also not interesting gameplay-wise. I have done Land 2, yes. Yes, it being Land 1 is non-negotiable. This will be a Land 1 level. Unless we push Land 1 to course 15, in which case you need to throw me a different game that we haven't covered yet. But Land 1 will happen for sure. It would be nice to land another black and white platforming level. I don't know about that. I mean, I haven't played Land 2 as a child. So for me, Land 1 is like the only one that I will have some nostalgia for. Only games that released before Mario 64 are eligible. Yeah, I know what you mean. The problem is that I can't think of a way to make the submarine section interesting. Look at the plane level. Isn't that the same thing, though? Okay, wait, this looks a hundred times better. The issue is going to be making front sprites for these. Shit, how are we going to make front sprites for the enemies? Or do we actually just make it the side scroller? But then it's just the same game, but worse. What's the issue, though? I don't want to make the same game, but worse. Or more worse. Well, maybe it won't be worse, but just like the same game. Playing as Iconic, yeah, I agree. And so if we have a plane model from Mario, we can have 3D plane enemies. Yeah. I might even add the Ken Ken. I can probably make them animate an actress out of like really simple sprites and voxel art. I think that works. And this is 4-3, 4-3 and the very last level. Hmm. Which enemies do we need? Hmm. This guy. And this guy. Okay, just those two. Star Fox to fight Mario Land? Yep, exactly. You can make a section with big walls that have a hole in them and you need to pass through them like the Ninja Mario Challenge. The mini builds too? You can do that, yeah. Do we need a Chi-Tao set? It's all just clouds. Okay, yeah, the clouds are here. And then the blocks. The blocks are here. And then the lines. The lines are here. Okay, perfect. How hard would it be to make a modern indie game not on Unity Unreal? Is it impossible to make it into a single guy? It's possible, it's just more work. And you're gonna have less features. Bye! Alright, these are going to be really long sprints, holy shit. Is this like 8x8? There is no way this is 8x8. 16x16. We also need a Mario model here. Did we just make a voxel art version? Although it would be weird if Mario was voxel art and the rest was not. See ya, baby. ID4? I'm fine with that. Alright, it's going to be all white, right? And we're going to leave the sides for the play area. We can't have the play area be too big. And we need to think of a way to limit the play area visually for the player. Maybe like 10,000x2,000? Why does the stream music suck balls? Ah, this is just YouTube auto-play. The music is really bad though. Okay, alright guys. I get it. I hope you're happy. I'm crying. Alright, we gotta think of a decent way to limit the play area. You can't complain about this song, right? This one's a banger. What if I just use one of these textures here along the rims? Make it a can fix in the center and the player can't escape the screen borders. Yeah, that is actually the simplest solution here. Good idea. Meow, meow, meow. Stars when you shine, you know how I feel. Scent of the pine, you know how I feel. Oh, freedom is mine. What the fuck? And I know how I feel. It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me. Feeling good. Do you think ear cancer can be cured? Sure. Google DeepMind just solved protein folding. I'm sure that's gonna help in curing ear cancer somehow. Cancer can be cured. Oh, Zelda already knows the cure, nevermind. If only those lizard people weren't taking away the cancer cure from us. Should this area have fog? What do you think? I feel like on one hand, fog takes away from the aesthetic. On the other hand, if we have no fog and you can see the entire level until the entire end here, it's gonna look like ass. We need fog. Not this song? I don't think that was the Metal Gear theme. You know what, galvanized square steel. Who else loves galvanized square steel? Hello Super Mario 64 fan. Yeah, I can't stop being curable in the next 10 years, seems perfectly reasonable to me. I wouldn't be surprised if we were the first person to achieve biological immortality. The first generation, not the first person. Can you play blah blah blah? No. I mean, yes, I can, but I'm not gonna. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Should we do the plane first? I wanna make a few of the clouds and then I make the plane, I think. I don't know. That is way too short of a rendering distance. Let me try this. I don't know the reason it's been that fun for a few years now. Yeah, I just put on some random music. I didn't want to look at the playlist for today. This is just YouTube autoplay. This is terrible music. I agree, though. She wants to take a ride on my disco stick.  It will be forced perspective. The camera will be permanently stuck like this. Then you're allowed to move in screen space, but you're not allowed to move the location of the camera. Mario is just gonna be going like this. Then enemies come in front of you. You're gonna move in the camera view. I think this will work pretty well. It's a little bit short, isn't it? Should probably be a good bit longer. I'm on a mission. It involves some heavy touching.  I don't know. It seems like a better length. Area background is not supported in this engine. And to have a solid white background instead of a corridor, you would need to support that in the engine, which would be more expensive. Technically, we could do like a GOSM to clear it all, but it's simpler to just do this. It's gonna be 60 FPS. The song is deep. I also consider to write a disco stick now. I'm pretty sure by disco stick she means a cock. In the song. Which is like. It's probably not what music should be about. Extremely smart. Thank you. What is the name of the song, by the way? I have no idea. I don't know. I didn't look. Just Google Lady Gaga sex song and you'll find it, I'm sure. We only want big Mario. I don't want to deal with small Mario. Okay, I will Google Lady Gaga sex song. Thank you. What is this? Can anyone tell me what the sprite on the right is? What is going on here? Hey. Oh, it's the propeller. That looks nothing like the sprite they showed. That looks nothing like this. Am I insane? It's like two pixels here. This is way more than two pixels. This is touching his nose. He looks completely different in Mario Land. Wait, the sprite is wrong. Look how different this looks. There's just one pixel of nose here. There's two pixels of nose here. There's a dot here and there's no dot on here. The sprite must be completely wrong. Also, the backside is completely different. That looks nothing alike. Oh, this is small Mario. Oh, yeah. Okay. It's the same one now. Travel around the world. You can say that. I'm not going to ban you for that. Okay. Making a 3D model of this. Yikes. How do I do that?   This should be 16 pixels by 16 pixels. Just making sure. 16 by 16. Okay. All right 250 divided by 16 is not this number Oh There we go And that's why to me sorry about this for you no It's not what's on my clipboard there we go When you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you   when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you  when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you  when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you    when you   when you when you when you    when you when you    when you       when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you      when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you  when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you when you   when you when you when you when you when you when you when you Meme reveal? oh, shit, meme reveal. my beautiful brazilian wife nico, big homo, rogue game, bald homo, brazil twitter ban, innocent straight men, we have some jack off the dudes now. is it still part of the assembly, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, oh my god they're so small i can't see them, is that mario? nice emote, i don't get it. yeah this looks a little bit like a plane. is luigi and waluigi kissing, oh, well then, cool, plenty of fun, something you enjoy. i think this is a decent 3d model for this, we can delete the entire front part because it's gonna be invisible in gameplay, this is only 420 vertices, triangles, looks very nice, nice, nice, nice, that's all i needed to hear. that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear,    that's all i needed to hear, that's all I needed to hear, that's all I needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all i needed to hear, that's all I needed to hear,
