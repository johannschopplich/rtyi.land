Hello. Ok. Hello Marty. Welcome to the stream. I did a lot of work off-stream. I finished the whole overworld here. L-O-S-T, dragon. Likely a lot new for you. Yeah, especially now that I'm done with the 0% NintendoCore project, I have been able to actually make progress on the hack again. Why is this happening? That's one thing that's really annoying me. Howdy Clayman. L-O-B-savory. Ship of Kasios, true. I finished like a Bowser gate here. Dude, this overworld... Hey. Who did that? Sonic the Hedgehog, thank you for the 28 months. So the vision for this overworld here is, this is the part of the island Bowser has taken over. Instead of the Yoshi village, I kinda changed my mind entirely. There was supposed to be a mountain village here, fuck that. This is now, Bowser has taken this over and ruined nature. So he has a giant drill, he's gonna have his headquarters here, you're gonna see Yoshi's being tortured inside the headquarters. And you need, I think I set it to 100 stars, and then the store opens. You can talk to this guy here as well. And then there's a secret path to the next part of the overworld, which requires you to blow up this rock. Which is what we're gonna be working on today. Let me just save the game so I don't have to blow it up every time. I'm not sure why the bug exists right now, but we'll figure it out. How do I view someone's discord name in streamer mode? Fuuuuck. Goddammit. I'm gonna have Zayna be the voice director for the Luigi voices, cause I think she knows what we're looking for. Better than I do. For the Luigi voice. We're gonna import Luigi soon into this game. I don't know if I told you guys. We're gonna add Luigi to this game, he's gonna get his own voices, and Zayna is gonna help me direct those voices. So I'm putting her in contact with the person that does the Luigi voices. Why is this happening? What the fuck? How many stars will you need to beat the game? Well that would be 100 if that door is the final bastion. But I'm not 100% convinced on that. Cause in Mario 64 you need 60% of the total stars. In this game if we have 200 stars, actually 60% is 120. So honestly, maybe 100 is just the right number. Yeah, I think 100 I actually like it. It's a nice round number. Field significance. Very achievable. What the fuck? Oh, I think maybe it's because this ceiling is an issue? Oh, Hedda has gone. Hello, Selten. Hey, there we go. So this is supposed to shoot you high enough to just go into the atmosphere. Yeah that definitely should be a 120 star or a 200 star unlock if there's 200 stars. Something like... You can now ride Yoshi in the overworld, I don't know. It's your birthday, my dude? Congratulations, you have become a whole year older since last year. Happy birth. Congratulations, you have been born. You had a new nephew five days ago? Dang, congratulations on that too. Is it true that nowadays people don't really have kids anymore and instead they live the parent life vicariously through their siblings? Or rather that this is becoming more common? And fault them. You know, on GO3 I saw that on your Discord status. This theme is so good. I actually don't need this. Let's do that. I mean I definitely don't mind that. I know that I think Zeyna's brothers are Isamu Laue where they're not gonna have children on their own right now but live the parent life vicariously through us having children and it is very helpful. Having to watch the child like all the time is quite a bit of work. Mastectomy seems like a bad idea. I don't want kids. I don't think it's fair. Well, and then are told you have to become functionary of society? That's bullcrap man. Well, that's only a risk if you're having sex. Sorry, that was just a quip. No you're definitely right. It is unfair that you are born against your will. I agree with the anti-natalism in that sense. There's a sense you don't agree with it then? I mean it is true that it is unfair just being born and being thrown into the world but also part of the anti-natalism movement seems to be like life has to be suffering and there's no way to make it meaningful and like the state of being born is inherently a bad thing. And that part I don't agree with. Oh, Xena's writing. Okay, nothing important. So I was going to hell in the handbasket and I don't want a kid to experience it. I don't think the world is going as bad as people think. People have been talking about the world going down for thousands of years at this point. And I know our situation is different but like every generation's situation is different. I think we're fine. Just being born means you can eventually discover alcohol consumption, the true meaning of life. I see, I see. I don't know. I think I would like to live forever. I think I'm not alive for long enough. I would like to live longer. I don't think living is all that bad. Again this gives you way too little time to actually get on the thing. Cool. What is this, crash? This is finish move. Oh shit, that's bad. Oh, I'm not touching that right now. What if we put this at this number here? Did I already fix it? Look at this little diorama you have here for the world. Isn't that kinda cool? Look, it's like a mini version of the level. Hello, basically graphic. That's nice. I have a new video coming soon. It's called why Nintendo 64 artists need to be mathematicians. I think Marty could tell you stories about that one, now that he's been making models with me. There we go, that mostly works. You're going to learn A minus B multiplied by C minus D. No, it's A minus B multiplied by C plus D. A D is added. Fixed function pipeline, yeah. No, it's a great video. I'm really looking forward to uploading that one. This is one I'm pretty happy with. Most videos I make is like, yeah, this is, everything I say here is true and this is information that might be interesting to you. It's not something I would personally be interested in watching. This one I'm about to make, I think I would love to watch the video. So, I'm looking forward to it. Well, D is also not multiplied by A minus B. So, I mean, there's kind of like two small errors here and that makes a huge difference because I think the exact formula they chose was like perfect. Yeah. Yeah. We're doing a little trolling. Yeah. Actually, no, it needs to be this. Humans are 90% linear algebra and interpolations. Well, you're thinking about physics. Graphics is very different. It's only 3D, I just need to understand math anyway. It's true. But it's a little more extreme in the N64, I think. Or it's a little different on the N64. Maybe you actually need to understand less math, but you need to be a lot better at basic math. You know what I mean? Like, you're not gonna need a college course or anything, but you better be really, really good at third grade math. Alright, we got the geyser. Oh. How do you get down? We have the geyser. We have the geyser. Where does this lead? Nowhere, yeah, it's cool. I think this is gonna be the Mario Golf level. Why aren't you reading the YouTube chat? Wait, is it not showing? Wait, wait, wait, guys, sorry. If I'm not reading the YouTube chat, that is because it's not showing. Oh my god, the YouTube chat is broken. Do you see that? There, it's just whited out. I'm sorry, YouTube chat. I have not been reading you guys because it's broken. Let me figure out why. Where is my YouTube chat? What the fuck? Sorry, I need to figure this out. We have 43 people here and I've been ignoring you guys? Hello, hello guys. Hello everyone. Oh my god, that's so many messages I missed. Oof, I'm sorry. Now, what do I do? What if I just reopen Restream? Nope, still not showing. I don't know what I can do. Let's see. Restream YouTube chat not working. Okay. Huh? Okay. We are here. Don't worry, I see you. Oh god, is Twitch still working? It is. Well, I guess what I can do is I can have them side by side here. That's really annoying though. We'll just have them side by side for now. That sucks. I guess I have to move my OBS over here. So Zeyna has been working on Bone Dragon off stream. But she didn't send the file to me, cool. You have to reset the stream big bro, there's no other way. Maybe that will work. How much monitors are you running? 3? Yes, 3 monitors. Okay. Wait. Restream is also unusable right now. This is awesome. Okay, that kind of works. I forgot I finished another entire Overworld off stream. This part here. We made some changes. We kind of readjusted this. So this is going to have a Bone Dragon in it. Zeyna is currently working on it. Bone Dragon looks so cool. You're going to be like, holy shit, that's the coolest thing ever once you see it. And then we have a little train station here. Where you can hop on. And go to Grand Saint Badland. If you got mistaken with the Eiffel Tower, just make sure that any of the colors aren't invalid and show Banning instead. They're quantized to multiples of 16. So you're going to have 0, 16, 32, 48 as intensity values. Now if you want to have more precision on that, You can use a combiner that transforms the values from 0 to 256 to something like 0 to 32. And then you get values like 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and so on. Anyway, our next mission is Boshi. Let me show you. Ascension of Terminator is completed. Of version 1, where we just import all the content, before Biobank's rework, I would say 95%. Wait, Boshi isn't going to be here. Yo, what is this? What the hell was that? So close. And wow, we're still waiting for Biobank's reworks. Using an N64 controller? Well, technically you can use this as an N64 controller. But this was made for the N64. So I'm not going to use it. I'm going to use the N64 controller. I'm going to use the N64 controller. I'm going to use the N64 controller. I'm going to use the N64 controller. I'm going to use the N64 controller. But this was made for the GameCube. And unlike every other texture format, it doesn't look blur-filtered. Oh no, that's an emulator bug, if anything. Anyway, next thing is. So we want Boshi to show up in the overworld. After you defeat him in Grand St. Patland. He's going to be around here somewhere, practicing his shots. Because he's sick and tired of you beating his ass. So let's import Boshi. F64 render should be somewhat accurate. But I don't think it quantizes the texture format for you. If you want to have that done. You can index it to 16 colors via GIMP. You have to pick the 16 colors in GIMP. And you have to put them to 0, 16, 32 and so on. Or you can import them with N64RIP. And then export them as I4 format. That's a massive 1TB SSD. I don't have a 1TB. Actually, I do have two 1TB SSDs. But my main one is pretty fucked. And I have 64GB of RAM. I need it for my day job. That is it for me. And sometimes it makes a very ugly one. But I hope you enjoyed it. And I'll see you next time. Bye. Well, forget about it for now. Okay, yeah. If you have images. I can probably make more sense out of what you are saying. Hey, hey. How have you been? I have been good. Hello. There is going to be a BoshiBoss. He is not really a boss. He is a mini-game. It's like a reaction time mini-game. There are two mini-games in Course 12. And Testa so far, I really like them. And Testa so far, I really like them. And Testa so far, I really like them. And Testa so far, I really like them. And Testa so far, I really like them. And Testa so far, I really like them. Is it true you are living inside a giant in 6.1? That's how you know it so well? Yeah. How long did you take to learn coding? C or C++? I didn't have to learn it. I just started doing it. Literally, my first day of programming in C, I made Mario 64 multiplayer. C is basically obvious. It's just logical statements. It's just logical statements. You just look at it and you understand what it means. Look at this. If goal Y is larger than position 1, obviously you know what that means, right? You know what it means. If the goal Y is larger than this, execute the code in here. Is that not obvious? Is that not obvious? Look at anything else. If this is not true, then execute the else part. This is just an English sentence. This is just an English sentence. Think about it. If the goal Y is larger than the position index 1, do that. Else, do this. That's just English language. I don't think you need to learn programming. I think it's obvious. Sorry, I got a little passionate. Oh, Marty? He is saying... ... ... Yes. If you look closely on this texture, you see that there is texture filtering here. But because it's quantized to steps of 16, it looks very bad. Now, what I do see here is you have 1, 2, 3, 4 shades of grey actually used. So, I presume your texture is mostly the same grey. What you could do is you could increase the contrast, so instead of having a thin ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Hello, is there not a single gradient here? ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I don't decide where the ads go and I don't really get paid for ads on Twitch. I can't do ads on Twitch anymore. If I could turn them off, I would. Let me show you how much money I actually get from ads on Twitch. ... ... ... ... ... Yeah, it's on the lowest setting, but actually no, it's on the recommended setting. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition Redefinition There is very little Mario 64 Decomp left in RTYI. In fact I don't even... I can't even compile the latest Mario 64 Decompilation. Whenever I want to start a fresh remake, I start off like R8 of the Mario 64 Decomp. Because they made some changes that makes me unable to compile it. I don't want to deal with it. What happened? What happened to you, Boshi? Looks fine to me. They all go to Castle Insights. Boshi, my brother, what happened? I have. I've heard of it. What do you think of it? I don't know. I'd find it a ghost ship. There's no secret in them though. True. Let's come back later with more updates. My shadow is glitchy and the port actually crashed when I tried entering Dark World. I see. The day that I start giving a fuck about the PC port is still... ...away. They got me some changes. The Mark 6 4D Compilation is an ongoing project. They are still updating it with changes to make stuff more readable, and document more functions, and name all the variables. But obviously, I have already read all the code, and I have exchanged a lot of code, and I have already named all the variables. So for me, none of that makes any sense. People have actually mostly stopped asking me to mod the PC port, which has been a pleasant change. Okay, I generally have no idea why Boshi doesn't animate correctly. What if I had to compile twice, because the first time around, it was still getting the Euler animations instead of the Quaternions? That actually was the reason it didn't work. Wow, Boshi brother, your nose looks wrong. What's going on with bro's nose? Wait, it just has a different color. Why? Please don't send me a random link. Hello, Siak. Can I just see what you're carrying for the final boss of your game? It will be cool, I hope. My name is Niyoshima, when she gets seizure, true. What is there even left to do on the PC port? On the Mark 64 PC port? The one that already exists? No idea. On the other one, apparently a lot. But also, the PC port I don't think is very good for modding, because there's so many things it can't do. I don't know if that's still true, I mean, I don't care about it. So I am not up to date on it. But last I heard, it was unable to do any type of two-cycle combiner, other than the ones that already exist on Mark 64. Which means modding it is basically futile. Hello, Cho-Yo-Sato-Mi-Mi-Ni-Miko. Biggest case by Sonic. I don't want it. Okay, so the throw animation doesn't seem to play. Oh. Well, no wonder it didn't play. Okay. Right, let's make a little target for Boshy here. Could be a solid PC port tester, it's full complex two-cycles. Yeah. Although we do have test ROMs, I think, for cycles and stuff. It's just no PC port seems to care about it. You know, it's basically the same criticism people give emulators, where people aren't making Nintendo 64 emulators, they're making Mario 64 emulators. And obviously if you make a Mario 64 emulator, it's not going to be very accurate for anything that uses things that Mario 64 wasn't using, which is basically every game ever. Walter. We need to cook a math. Walter. Most of the ROMs seem to get ported and maxed with Chrome DX, and even then it's usually more important for ROMs that don't use stuff like the random blue switches. That's just ancient ROMX. What happened to the last impact port to PC port? The people making it were like, yeah, we're definitely finishing it 100%, with all the content, we're definitely finishing it. And then... I don't think that happened. I don't think they even finished 5%. But why making an emulator is so difficult? Well, first of all, who said it's difficult? I don't know if it's difficult. I assume it's a lot of work. I don't know if it's a lot of work. I assume it's a lot of work. I assume it's a lot of work. Jesse. We need to cash this. Jesse. So I just transfer things about now? Okay, what tool do you use to export them? I don't know. Because adding translation support is trivial. The problem is supporting it in a tool, which I assume is also trivial, but I haven't done it yet. Oh, who is the main developer of Coop? Is it Exo? Every time I see people talk about Coop, they're always talking about Exo's repository. Did Exo do that? Man, is cat edited. Oh, that's the person that wanted to do the last Impact PC port. Ask him why that's not done. I have not known. This texture sucks balls, man. This is awful. I meant the Coop part of last Impact. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Wait, YouTube chat is back. I just realized I've been reading the YouTube chat twice. Hey, let's go. Can you bullseye on a target? Nope. It's only for Boshi. You don't get to shoot at it. Which makes it compatible with last Impact? Okay. What now? What do I do now that I have imagined it? I like this one. Here I go. Should we systematize using those fronts? This one? Okay, I don't care about bots. Okay, I don't care about bots. Finish the bot first, man. Why are you making bots? Hello, MadLeaderDuckPerson. Welcome to the stream. The port is technically done since version 1.01. The port is technically done and it crashed when you entered Bowser in the Dark World. I'm starting to have issues with this mod. So the things that I do with customfits are normally consistent. Yes! That's the combiner! So, wait... Wait... This is part of my next video, actually. Well, I'll explain that real quick for you. 64 mathematicians... There's like a rescale combiner I'll show here. Yes, this image here. So if you set the primitive color alpha to 0.25, that means your texture, instead of going from black to white, it goes from black to like a dark grey, right? And then you set your base color into primitive color. You can set this to something like grey. Now your texture goes from grey to like a lighter grey. And you have all 16 steps between grey and lighter grey, instead of between black and white. So like, let's say I have my texture like this, my floor, and I convert this into I8, it's gonna turn like this. Obviously that looks terrible. So instead, I take this texture here, I up the contrast into that, by this combiner, and now I get this in-game. Does that make sense? You figured it out? You did? It wasn't me? You figured it out? Okay, I see how it is. No, I'm kidding. Sorry. That sounded really mean. I didn't mean to actually sound mad. I apologize. Hello, Cloud Caesar. Hello, Zena. You brought the baby back home? I was showing the baby Mario earlier. I was doing long jumps, and she looked at him and went, Ma! Yahoo! I was showing the baby Mario earlier. I was doing long jumps, and she looked at him and went, Ma! Yahoo! She loves her Mario. Here's their grandparents. Oh, so you didn't bring it back home. Shiiiit. Showing the baby mario? Baby mario, true. Making things to my monster so that it becomes faster than I could. Oh, I see. Didn't realize how bad ER wait times were. Well, that's why I didn't want to come with you. I figured either you go alone and spend five hours or we go together and spend five hours, but me being there is not gonna change how it goes. So they said everything was fine. Can we go away from my mother and father to weaken the lost love or is the N64 not capable of doing that? The N64 is capable of doing that and that's this RU program for you. You just need to boot up Mario Party 1. How cool is Boshi? So he's going to be standing here and he's going to be throwing eggs at the dart here and when you talk to him he's going to be like leave me alone I'm practicing. And he's going to do this until you have like 180 stars. At 180 stars he's like okay you know what I admit you're pretty good at this. Why don't you give me some tips and then he asks you a couple questions and then he starts hitting the target every time. That's my plan for this. I think it's a cute interaction. Also gives this part a secret star. There's no secret star here yet. Reminds me a bit of that Sonic fanfic. What's Sonic fanfic? Sonichu? Nothing personal kid. Man I'm excited to get course 13 tested. Zena you didn't send me Bone Dragon by the way. The nothing personal kid is a shit poster right? That's on purpose. Nothing personal kid makes me miss the old internet. Do you think how useful is starting off in GL in life? Probably moderately depending on what you want to do in your life. I don't know. This part you definitely need some textures for the first beta test that aren't just this. Wait what the hell? How is this supposed to work? Am I missing warps here? Oh yikes. Hello game david. Oh right I guess this is like non-euclidean space with red points. I see. At least outside. Yeah the inside is not done. I remember this area looking so rough. It's because I didn't do anything here yet. I remember I was working on this and in the middle of working on it Biobax said don't worry about making it look good I'll do that later. And then I just didn't worry about making it look good. Is using any code from r64? That's a complicated question. I don't know. Legally or emotionally I don't know. So when you're young it looked okay? No way. I mean I think if I just put some basic vertex colors over it it is going to look okay. Okay fine I'll look at it. Why? Why'd you make me look at this? What the hell? DVN OST? Trust gang? That makes me trust you less. He is pressing the unsee button. So interesting that you're building around some blender and are able to get in game with r64 movements. Yeah you can do that too if you use the r64 decompilation. This is originally based on the r64 decompilation but at this point I have gone over basically all the r64 code and exchanged it with my own code. So I mean like for example the star select. The star select now works differently. But it still has mostly the same function. So Eliya is actually hiding offensive slur against the Hellenistic pupils. I'm calling cyber bullies. Go ahead. Definitely an Eevee bug. Don't trust Eevee, trust Fast64Renderer. It's made by hell to the dongle, that guy knows what he's doing. What the fuck? Okay. I am copying the code, I am being lazy here. We care about development time, not about code quality here. This is a fucking stupid object behavior. But also there's going to be some differences here. Let's see. Okay I see. I don't think we need this. Oh no, we spawned a Seer. Right, we need to back up his original position here. Yes, that's happening. But it is generally much more accurate and less likely to render. Okay, this is a fair point. I should be copying this as well. I think zero is meaningless. Okay, he should be juggling an egg now. I'm in my own first set, but I'm an awful coder. Dang. Unlucky. But it's okay, I guess it made you a better artist. It probably actually did. Unironically. Okay. Some issues remain, but they're fixable. So do. So that should now throw the egg. I wish I had infinite free time. I would go out and make a snow Yoshi out of snow. That would be fun. Okay, it went out of bounds. It has to be this one. Does that compile? Moveflex doesn't exist. What are they called? Moveflex lowercase or Moveflex? I love Mark64 decompilation. Oh cool, it was a slugger on Yoshi's Island watching the bossy throwing the egg when he talked to him. He says I want to give him tips, but he only talks to real bros. A slugger? Which one's that? Moshi will tell me that's true. Moshi would be fun. I was thinking of your snow cat because of that, but also there is a struggle player, a friend of mine. She made an actual snow Yoshi and it looked very good. Come on, throw it! Okay, interesting. So it's like this, let's do it. Oh well, he's an enemy, so I don't want that. You know, I recently had a theory. You know how Mario has an evil clone and Luigi has an evil clone? What if Daisy is Peach's evil clone? Because she doesn't have another evil clone. What if they made Meech like an actual evil Peach? That would be banger. Meech. What if Peach is the evil one? Hmm, fair point. She is a monarch. Varro Peach? Wait, Varro Peach actually exists? There we go, he's throwing his axe. So I want to make a miss and as you get more stars, I want this hit rate to improve. That egg just exploded in the sand. Okay, the egg should never explode in the sand. That's not good. I think I know why. Never mind, I have no idea why. So do do do but now we just need to figure out why it sometimes explodes and then put in the formula for him hitting or missing but i'm the bruno she's i used to think she was just like evil female ufc cool cool cool cool cool cool cool why wait actually why i don't see the bug that's wild pj henry yoshi all right let's figure out the bug guys i love this emulator i can't believe i can use an emulator for playing and for debugging at the same time the future is crazy dude stc1 oh she echo w a zero one a eight oh so it's only j pointer one that's invalid huh oh fuck obviously you see how useful that is to just look at the assembly this is lunas project 64 by far the best emulator to play mario 64 mods in why did it explode stop exploding in boshi's hand sometimes he froze how's their randomness to this if only my random function wasn't non-deterministic so i could actually test what the fuck is going on throw it throw it throw it throw it throw it throw it throw it okay so when he does throw he almost hits you right so let me do the best exactly because it has gliden 64 which allows you to use x3 it also has legacy romhack support which allows you to play old romhacks it has a built-in debugger which means i can just open the assembly and look what's wrong and it has all the conveniences of graphics plug or input plugins like nrage which is by far the best input plugin so it just has the best of every world it also has low spec modes that allow you to play this on garbage pcs footprint variable coming well i don't know i don't really see it why would it sometimes explode it doesn't really make sense unless the order of operations was wrong i know it's perform actor move i know it's because it's hitting a wall somehow if you want me to figure out in the debugger why it's hitting the wall it's going to be a lot harder than just looking at the code i need now pretty much hit some bullseye every time that's good i want to rotate them around one degree i think so the question is how is it even possible that there is randomness here because this is a hundred percent deterministic if you can have less impact on my phone once i can almost recess in it i use one of those control you can actually phone that's cool set the right button on the explosion skip and wait for it to fire early then step back to see no you're giving awful tips you have no idea what you're talking about i know what's triggering it it's the wall and perform actor move maybe what she said is coming as a well no that's not solid oh my god and even if it did it's deterministic that can't be it there has to be some randomness here which probably means it's got something to do with the way it's allocated from ram so what we can try is to clear the flag early like so which because maybe perform actor move doesn't clear it perfectly because the velocity is zero or something like that so the second one off and the bell itself was broken too dang that's crazy so not pistol exploding sometimes now clearly it's not the time apart i'm thinking but i want to remove this once anyway just it's like an insanity chunk so that's the reason why the game isn't out yet no oh my god it's the timer oh obviously okay now i know why it's because we set the action to one without clearing the timer because the order of operations is wrong this is because the action is set to one right here instead of in the other place that makes sense so we need to set the timer to zero here as well because boshi's script updates before the egg and then we can add that back and now it will work just fine now had i actually gone and tried to use the debugger that would have taken a lot longer because you have to debug this all in assembly you would have just instantly seen the timer being like a hundred and be like why does it start at a hundred and then you would have to load a safe state and you'd have to set a memory breakpoint and then because the randomness is non-deterministic you'd be wrong most of the time so you'd have to try this like 10 times until you finally see oh wait the breakpoints that the values already set before the action is set all right next we need to program misses so i want the miss rate to depend on how many stars you have um that's going to be decided here miss chance equals um so he's always going to miss until you have around 120 stars um then when you have 100 stars i think i'm going to increase this chance slowly you get 80 more stars that's 0x50 multiplied by 0x100 so he's getting around around the 30 chance to hit once you have 200 stars uh actually i think we can up this to 60 so this will always miss and then we do like in wrong angle equals 20 16 uh so we do that well one more year i should say and then we'll just do some geometry here that should be fine so this way we can guarantee he's always being slightly off center oh but actually i think i want to keep df well i think instead of going that way it should be like the wrong guy this is the wrong guy's angle will be so let's not do this let's keep the f all consistent let's make it so that if the cosine of that is wrong then this one here plus equals since wrong value by wrong angle much all right now he should always be way offset sometimes too high yeah he will like always throw in a circle around the goal now that's the idea wait he hits he did the hit animation did i invert the chance i did so come on throw it nice let's see him miss let's see him suck at this i'm having fun he sucks dude he sucks look at them i should make him have sound still so can you trigger both side when you're not looking yes you can so the way it works now until you have 120 stars he's always going to miss and then as you get more stars he is slowly starting to hit and then at some amount of stars he's going to ask you for tips and then he's going to start always hitting and he's going to give you a star for it okay he does that a little early so very cool so all right next we need the talk part so let's move and go so you get some of the amount of stars exactly but also he only appears in the overworld after you've beaten him in a level so at first he's kind of sulking over it but eventually he starts being like okay well actually you're kind of really skilled at what you do teach me it's the idea he has a little maturing arc you know i live in canada i lived in germany until late 2021 interesting well you have to play it safetel i mean it was just a language country flag wait what did you just do a rematch no the first match is like a a cowboy standoff so i feel that would be unfitting it should be fine does this give you a one frame window where you can talk to him afterwards where you will miss i don't like that okay needs to actually we can keep this 14 if we also put this code here oh wait no it's completely fine we don't need this at all but we might as well otherwise it will look wrong by one 30 seconds of a rotation now he did spawn the act twice and i understand why it should prevent that let's see if the act now animates during the talking cutscene are ticklish everybody's ticklish to some degree he can't not be ticklish there's not a single person that isn't ticklish i see that looks kind of bad but i don't think there's much i can do without changing a lot encounter from god of war is ticklish yes obviously yes actually fully dependent it's been said can you're telling me there is a person that is not even a little bit ticklish i'm not familiar with carcass no way there has to be like a weird mental medical condition there's no way you can't be not ticklish at all i don't believe it i want to make the map soon i haven't played any god of war games should i i heard they're slob i heard the god of war games are like the video game equivalent of like reality tv shows like playing god of war is like watching the bachelor or something just for autonomic responses if you're definitely ill what neurological disease symptom autonomic response is tickle response that makes sense it's a living measurement of ticklishness i'm sure there's some amount of brain activity you can measure then it's being triggered when you get tickled you know what he can ask you a little bit earlier for help and then what is this six four multiplied by two c8 yeah he has a decent hit rate so it's six seven what's it six oh my god this line this file is almost ten thousand and it's half of it it is going to be ten thousand lines of code by the time the game is done just one file no last impact is not part of the canon and hellboy is stupid it doesn't sound very boshy at the end but that's fine biobank would save us but all those numbers in defined dialogue there are things like where's the dialogue placed and what sound does it make how much is the sound pitched how many lines per box of dialogue i'm a sharpshooter now comboed into fucking completely missing it's awesome i don't like that this yoshi has almost the same color as a boshi the cool thing about my yoshi coloring system is if i just move him a little bit his color is going to be completely different 15 e18 level units and except a small niche population true which looks much more lower quality than the other yoshis oh yeah here's the pre-reward yoshi the other one is the post-reward yoshi that's why so okay that's a better color for him was a ruined part of the island all the animals flat i still have to add a shit ton of animals all over the island all right all that's missing for boshi now is him questioning the player about tips and tricks so what animals will you add grasshoppers butterflies birds crabs so i think i will never mind if i show you later you can just show them a discord nope it's still slightly off you know why is it so far off oh well um i am done for today that means i will see you guys probably next week i think we made good progress i'm kind of not sure what to upload for shots anymore for for clips anymore in the cleese clips channel i've been working on a lot of things but not a lot that i can really showcase so i will see you in the next stream bye bye
