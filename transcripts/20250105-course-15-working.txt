Lockdown, everyone is ignorant, police... Hello? Where are my people at? Hello Klemen? I have a test, and they tell me people are screwed up. Hello James? Hello DidiNava? This level has changed a lot since stream last saw it. It's extremely different now. How far away am I? I don't know. Stop asking. It is done when it is done. This level no longer has a name actually. Hello Solomon? Hello Selton? Hello Dylan, I am doing well. I hope everyone's enjoying the new demo. If you've even heard of that yet, I released the second demo today. Looks like people somewhat like it. It's good. Haha, you like the bassist line I take it? I want to reduce the overall noisiness of this a little bit, because a lot of people complained about that. Yeah, the demo is up. I released this earlier today. I'm gonna upload a full playthrough of it tomorrow. Keep in mind the demo is just course one. Nothing else, only the first level. If your computer can't handle emulators, that's a little crazy, I agree. Maybe it was 15. Hello Esa, it is course 15. Esa, remember when we made this for the slide basically, and then I changed everything, and now it looks nothing like the slide, I hope. 3, 4, 2, and 1. And 10 actually. 3, 4, 2, 10. True RIP slide. The slide is still up somewhere in the background, but oh my god, the slide looks so bad compared to this. Color theory and all that. Dude, fuck color theory. I hate, I don't like color theory. I don't think color theory is real. I think it's all bullshit. I think color theory is a principle made goal, that doesn't actually function as a goal, and people pretend it's a goal, but it shouldn't be. I don't even use color theory. Funny. Damn, so we need to make it so that you can cross the gap here somehow. I didn't even have the Z plus A move, because it was so strong that like that basically wasn't a game anymore. Also, did you know if you mash A, you go higher? Cool, right? How do you get angle glide then? You should be able to find that online. Yeah, it's like the down B in Super Smash Bros. Did you ever play Super Smash Bros? You learned color theory around Koopa Kanoa? No, I did not learn color theory. I learned about colors. It's very different. I do not subscribe to traditional color theory at all. By the way, we need an OST. Any OST wishes, any takers? Super Paper Mario OST, let's do it. Really love the new video, that's good. Oh, that's loud as fuck. From Blade Smash Remix? I have played Smash Remix. It was a lot of fun to see. Although I played it on real console and... Holy shit, the performance. I am not taking requests for individual songs. I only take requests for OSTs. Unless you use a Twitch point. No, why not? Did Daryl say no? So... Hello, X-Lings. So... Oh, assist stream music, yeah, yeah. Well, I don't know how much of the SimpleFlips hack that you guys want to make, you want to talk about yet. But there is alternate solutions that I can think of. I hope there's a pre-patch for this when it comes out. I've tried patching my own ROMs. It will be very easy to patch. I think you'll figure it out. Yeah, I need to make this... Gap smaller without ruining everything. By the way, the theme for this is like retrofuturism. So we want this to look like a space colony as imagined in 1960. Well, even if it's up on YouTube, that doesn't mean it's not struck, right? It might still be struck for copyright and then it's like... You can't monetize it and that would ruin the bot for SimpleFlips. So... I think that could look good if I make that. So... Wait, case theme edition? Wait, wait, wait, what? You already made that? Hello NecroJames, I also do not speak Italian, so I don't know what that means. So... Underground fields designed temporarily? Because I could see an image of being able to know when Mario is in them and then the borders are not easily apparent on the screen. We might need some VFX on Mario. If you are correct, that seems a little difficult to tell what's going on. Translates to good luck, good luck, thank you for the good luck, Mr. Italian Man. So... The video was so cool. I'm glad you liked it. I really wasn't sure if that video would do well at all because it's like too high tech. But so far it seems to be doing well. Okay, I kind of like that. The gravity zone might need to extend upwards a little bit more. I keep forgetting I changed it so you can only spin or ground pound dive at any time. Because otherwise the movement is too broken. So... I'm gonna remove all momentum because it's supposed to be like a safety move, like a kick. You're not supposed to be using it all over the place. It's supposed to be like, man, I fucked up. I'm gonna use the spin and I'm gonna feel ashamed for it. I don't think that explaining the lore of the library is a very smooth way of doing it. If anything, we would want implicit storytelling. Oh, did I tell you guys what the boss fight in this area is gonna be? I didn't because I made this up like two days ago. So I'm thinking, since this is like a 1960s retrofuturism type thing, we should use a monster similar to movies that came out in the 1950s or 1960s. So the idea I had is that the boss fight in this area is gonna be the blob, basically. So there's gonna be a big gelatinous mass with like a large brain in it that took over the factory over here. And it's gonna kind of move around like water. And you're gonna have to walk up to it over these steel bars here and kick it in the brain to damage it. And then it shoots you back with a wave. And the platforms here are gonna get a little bit more difficult. It no longer is the octopus alien monster. I will do it one day, Applegreen, as soon as Fasana is ready for it. But they are still working on it. So... Okay, I need to move this a little bit out. I really like how the satellites look. No, it's rotating too far. Finger bark? What's that? By the way, Aza, you're still here. Is there any progress on our SimpleFlips entry thing? I have decided to not rush progress or anything. I'll leave this entirely up to YouTube. For some reason, Godzilla and King Kong... I noticed that too, but they don't really seem like space monsters. So... Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? So, I mean, it should be a bit rounded around the edges. Yeah, yeah, I'll definitely change them. Someone on Twitter sent me like a really good concept art for those. And I will definitely use what they showed me. Space Godzilla, true actually. So now we have two paths around the main area and both of them lead up there. Look like PMVs and that shit is aesthetic as fuck. What is a PMV? It's PMV. Speed gains are mostly spent on like more polygons and details, for example this area here, you can see that this area is like relatively high detail right, we need the performance gains here. This is expected to be done. Mods kill this person, shoot them, don't even ban them, just straight up take them on back and shoot them. So the idea is you go around this whole platforming section and then come on top of here and there will be monorails everywhere, retrofuturism is all about monorails I've learned and then that somehow has to lead up. I don't know what that emote is, something with Biolizard from Sonic Adventure 2, no I can't reference Sonic Adventure 2 again. I really liked the feel of Mars Movement Camera Control, that took a while to get used to but I like it, that's good. That's what I heard a lot, people were like oh the camera took a bit to get used to but then I loved it. I'm surprised it takes time to get used to at all because like it's so similar to Vanilla Mario 64 Camera. When you find all the information about the inner workings of its camera you can imagine it's the same as any computer, so I'm just amazed that the CSC students are putting quite hard sometimes to get something like this. I just learned it through osmosis. No the monster is the blob and it's gonna have little blobs all over the space colony here that you can like kill easier, that harass this guy guys. So it makes sense that they're all held up and the blobs are gonna be the enemy throughout the stage here. Well it's not like I'm sorry for referencing SA2, it's just that if I reference it too much people are gonna be like this guy just keeps copying SA2, does he even have an original thought? I would kind of like a wallkick section up here but I'm not sure what the theme is after. We also still need the spaceship to look like a rocket. So maybe we can look out like retro futuristic rockets. Retro futuristic rockets? Does that exist? Would Bernd does board in space? Nope. Poor Bernd, he doesn't deserve this. Is this what they imagined rockets to look like? That looks very similar to mine, that would be funny. The main difference is like spiky things, the texturing is kind of different obviously. In a balloon what color would it be? This one. I want this one. We can still think about the background stuff but we need the main platforming down first. So that kind of looks like... I kind of like how rusty that looks. Let me see if I can do something like that. That drags way too much attention I think. I do not have a tutorial. I have tutorials, Nintendo killed them. I had a funny idea recently that somehow didn't work. Let me show you. So okay, this was with my idea, this was without my idea. My idea was we run the code directly from the cartridge instead of from RAM. So that way we would prevent using the RAM bus to execute code. And obviously this costs like two milliseconds of CPU time. But I had hoped that it would reduce RDP time because it has more memory available to it. Unfortunately it did not and I don't know why. It's not in space so things shouldn't rust. This game doesn't obey the laws of physics, I can't support it's development anymore. You're actually right, it should not rust. That looks like shit though. Welcome to the stream, Myomeg. I'm trying to figure out how to make this rocket climbable. So I'm definitely going to have a monorail here and the monorail is going to go in a circle. And I'm probably also going to have some monorails down here. There should probably be like four monorails going in a circle so you can climb on any of them. Did I learn something? Okay, I learned about what color theory is but it's like, I think it's extremely stupid. Maybe that's a better way to put it. Hello, Sambo. Hello. I'm surprised how many people wanted to play the demo. I didn't think people were really interested in the demo that much. That's probably a way better rocket shape. The advantage of having a smaller rocket shape is less overdraw, so I kind of like that. Big bounce platform. You mean like... Oh, that actually would be cool if the monorail had like a trampoline on the back. What would we theme it like though? Futuristic monorail.  Reset the quest inside the rocket. Now... That would break my plan of having the boss make everyone lock up. And that would make it so you don't get a round tour on star 1. That would be cool. It being bouncy could look really cool. So you would release the demo on Christmas time? That would explain why people are asking for you. I released the demo today, Lemon Guy. Just today. It is already out. You can play it right now. Remember I was aiming to move around the colony 24x7? Yeah, that's the idea. It would be probably like 4 in this circle and then 3 in this circle. And maybe like 8 in the bottom circle. Is he going to appear in this level since he's on a UFO? He's not going to appear in the game unless you save state. Small platforms over that thing. Connect the ridges. Tower from towers. Factory on that side. Oily Boily Bay plagiarism? No. It's... No, no, no, no, no. This has a lot more verticality to it than Oily Boily Bay. It's different. I don't think that's plagiarism. I think that's just what a good level layout looks like. Hello. Hello, Kwei. So I found out today that my game does not boot on the EverDrive X7. So right now I'm trying a build where I invalidate the entire RAM before I boot the game. So this has been running for like over an hour. I could probably have done a better test. Just to see if that makes it boot. Because I noticed that the EverDrive is not clearing beta cache. Which is tragic. Hello, Shane. I am good. How are you? Oh, god. There's... Okay, sorry. I would never genuinely ask how you are. I apologize for doing that on a joke. I hate when people ask how are you. It's the worst. Check Westworld terrain designs. Some are classic, but there are some retrofusion ideas. I have not. Okay, interesting question. So Emmanuel Khan says you should always act like you want others to act. You should act after your own Maxime. And I think no one should ever ask me how you are. Because that's fucking annoying. But at the same time, it is considered polite to ask people how they are. And people will feel better about themselves if you ask them how they are. So, according to Khan, should I ask people how they are or should I not? Technically, I should not, right? But that just makes the world a worse place for everyone else in it. So does that really make sense? Hello, Sam Memory. I have no idea what I think Minecraft. I don't. 12 chunks of memory. How much is a chunk in Minecraft? It's like, what, 64 by 64? And then you have to put all of them? Oh, it's also three-dimensional. How big are Minecraft chunks? 256 maybe? And then, like, what? 24 by 24? That's 12 megabytes. Why does it take 24 megabytes? That's like one block, two blocks. 16 blocks in a single chunk?  Why does it take 24 megabytes? Thank you for the sub. How are you? Good, you? Good, good. It's a preset sentence. You're going to be normal society. It doesn't take much. So it's not a problem. Right, I am aware of all of them. I still don't want people to do it. I'm asking if Immanuel Kant wants me to do it or not. Alright, let's see this. I can't keep moving on with the game. There's no way to store large worlds. 25 million blocks of... Okay, so it is 25 million blocks, so there's way more blocks per chunk than I thought there would be. Yeah, it's pretty neat. I can't keep up with this one.   Well, you can use SRAM or SD card libraries to store it. No, I'm pretty sure you can make Minecraft run on the N64. Hello, Mushy. Alright, let's make this look bouncy on top. How do we do that? ... Right, but that's not what Immanuel Kant says, Biobak. That's what I'm getting at. Immanuel Kant says you should act as though you act the way everyone else ought to act. You're supposed to act the way you want other people to act. And I don't want other people to say, Hello, Ariel. That's the thing. ... No, he probably said that the render distance is 12 chunks, so it's like 12 in that direction, but also 12 in that direction, and 12 in that direction. ... That's philosophy. True. He's Immanuel is a parody of Immanuel. True. Bouncy Blob. Oh, that's actually a good idea. It could be the same substance as the Blob, but then you would think it's like an enemy, right? ... But the Blob design is like a banger idea, because we can prime the opponent to want to jump on the Blobs right away. But we need to make it look different somehow. Yes, Anti-Maya targets 1.6. ... ...  I keep saying this. Also, the thing I like to say is that the more people are in a conversation, the more valuable each second of audio bandwidth is. So the more people are in a conversation, the more valuable each contribution you do should be. And some people don't understand this. ... And they are really annoying. What's Blob? ... I was thinking, since this is retrofuturism, we should have the boss in this being designed after a movie from the 1950s, and this is like a boss that came from space. So if this boss was in the stage, I think that would be really cool. What I'm thinking is there's going to be one big Blob with a big brain inside, and you kick his brain to damage him. And then there's going to be multiple smaller Blobs around the level, and you jump on them to kill them. ...  I feel like that wouldn't look very bouncy, though. It looks more sticky. Minecraft slime? Look, Minecraft copied the movie, if anything. And that is not my fault. ... ... ...    ...        Oh, it's true, it's like the enemy from R-Senshin. ... ... ... ... Does that exist? ...  ...   ... And this works on Parallel Kazini, at least it should.  ... No! Leave me alone, man! ... ...    Yep, it works on Parallel.  Putting Trampoline. ... ... ...   I don't understand. ... ... They're not gonna have a Bowser sticker. There's the Bowser here. I don't understand putting Trampoline.   Could make it a little rounder. ... I could make it a hexagon shape. Hexagons are very futuristic. People in the future love hexagons. ... They would put them everywhere. ...  They know hexagons are the most efficient shape. ... ...  ... Jello? No, no, no, no, no. I don't like that. That doesn't feel like a trampoline. Yes, this is a moon base. Hello, Mr. Right. Thank you for the like. That kind of looks like a hexagon, right? Monsieur, you said you want to run Madness again and you want me to co-commentate with you. I think that could be very funny. Is that a new senpai idea? Next time, if I have time, I'll do it. What if we just make this the most amazing bridge trampoline material of all time? I want to make a version of Sluggy the Unshaven. He seems pretty slick for this. Sluggy the Unshaven. Oh, but isn't he a ghost? That's a very good idea, though. Is he a ghost or not? No, World 5. Yeah, I think I like your idea. I think we'll make it Sluggy the Unshaven. Is my boy Luigi going to make a cameo on RTY? Possibly. All right, fuck it. Instead of the blob, it's Sluggy the Unshaven. Good call. Sluggy the Unshaven. So I'm fine with Sluggy the Unshaven. That's my thought process here. Is there a meta-setup for debugging ROMs that aren't supposed to be? I'm not enough of a Linux-cell to tolerate this. There is the Namu emulator, which I like a lot. You can just open the debugger like this and you can put breakpoints wherever you want and go step by step. You don't need to be a Linux-cell at all. You can just read the assembly. Let's peek. You think Sluggy is bouncing? I don't think he is. I think he's fruity. Yeah, but he's not an alien. Well, I guess an alien creature would still work. Still though, Sluggy the Unshaven is so much better. And also, what's there to do for a script boss fight? Also, even if there is one, isn't Sluggy the Unshaven really cool? He's from Yoshi's Island. We love Yoshi's Island here. I mean, the whole game is called Return to Yoshi's Island. Why not reference Yoshi's Island a little bit? Why is everyone acting like this is an issue? He is slime, but he's a ghost and definitely not retro-futuristic. What's your idea? Is it the same as the Bomb Factory level? Nah, it's very different. This one is all smooth surfaces and blinking lights and stuff. Is this how Brody attacks us? I did not know that. This is a terrible texture for this. Is it the Bomb Camp color scheme? The Bomb Camp color is much more dark and rusty and a lot higher texel density and dark greens. I think it's different. This is your concept? Gate Solver? Okay, I kinda like this. But what about the boss fight? I don't know. Based off Fuzzy's? The only reason I can't base it off Fuzzy's is because you need to drop an enemy. I see, I see. I can see how Squid is more epic. But there's still a question of how do you defeat Squid. Is there a new demo yet? Because I've just been away from gaming for the last couple of weeks, but there was a new stream. I was working on this game in Episode 9 and I'm still using SketchUp. His game is honestly just a Star Revenge game by the looks of it. If you've played Star Revenge, I don't see why you wouldn't want to play his game as well. Because it's the same. I don't drink coffee. I think coffee tastes like ass. Tentacles? Oh shit, you're right. Like black holes opening and tentacles coming out. Oh, but that's gonna be so ass with the camera. Unless we have the black holes all come from the same direction and there's like tentacle attacks coming out of it. But then how do you damage him? Let's think about this. The boss is here.    And the factory. We can change the factory layout completely. I'm not attached to this at all. Boss on one side, Mario on the other. Black hole appears, tentacle comes out to attack him. That's really cool. Head pops out and you throw something at him. Let me look at Kid Sora again. His head pops out. There could be black holes with tentacles all over the level too. Oh my god, that would look so cool. Imagine black holes with tentacles coming out of it all over the level attacking Mario. Imagine black holes with tentacles coming out of it all over the level attacking Mario. Punch big asteroids at it. I don't see how the player would think to hit them back. Fortnite rifts? Oh, they look really good. Yeah, it could be something like that. So he would get attacked from all sides maybe. But then how would the player ever figure out where to... We could... Crazy idea. The rift could be really bright and we could use dynamic lights to shine light onto Mario The rift could be really bright and we could use dynamic lights to shine light onto Mario so the player knows where the attack is coming from. And then we alternate between rifts appearing and the squid appearing And then we alternate between rifts appearing and the squid appearing with its eyes poking out and maybe it shoots lasers at you and then you can just punch it in the face when it does that. I think that works. Now there's one figured out. It will be very easy to figure out. You will see a light on the floor, a light on Mario. It will be super obvious. Yeah. Yeah. The one problem I have with that is that maybe players won't figure out that if it's poking out its head, you're supposed to hit it. that if it's poking out its head, you're supposed to hit it. How do we make something like this look more vulnerable? How do we make something like this look more vulnerable? Oh yeah, it kind of has that effect.    It's like that bug enemy from Odyssey. I don't really know Java. I don't know what that is. I don't really know Java. I don't know what that is. I think I've seen it on Family Guy. The fat slug. Oh, right. Oh, right. If it shoots lasers out of the eyes, put the player thing to do that. I guess if it has two eyes and shoots lasers I guess if it has two eyes and shoots lasers and then the eyes are red pulsating and then you kick the eyes, that would be a really good indicator. I think that works. Yeah, we'll do something like that, I think. Alright, back to trampoline. I call this my futuristic top hat. I call this my futuristic top hat.    And I don't see how that works. It's a funny idea. But we're probably going to use these white looking rifts instead of black holes for the tentacles to come out. I want them to be visually different. Just the black holes are teleports. It's like a facto-forgo with Kirby slowly It's like a facto-forgo with Kirby slowly pushing into a black hole.  Facto-forgo? I don't know what that is. It sounds like the pushing enemy fight from Yoshi's Island.  There are some Ocarina of Time textures, yes. There are some Ocarina of Time textures, yes. I think, maybe. I'm actually not 100% certain. Wait one second, this is important. Wait one second, this is important. Wait one second, this is important. The other grass types can pop out of the black holes and say inane, pompous things. The other grass types can pop out of the black holes  We have some fancy monitors These are the weakness of the tentacles I don't think there's any fancy optimization we can really do here. I don't think there's any fancy optimization we can really do here. Sorry, I'm still a little distracted Sorry, I'm still a little distracted Sorry, I'm still a little distracted    Sorry, I'm still a little distracted  Sorry, I'm still a little distracted Sorry, I'm still a little distracted  That looks terrible, I don't want this What is going on Orange Mint Choco Vanilla, what you doing? Nice kind of happy birthday, even though you can't hear me Hello Vellzey, hello Joseph, I will not adopt you Maybe we can look at like retrofrustrated trampolines, maybe we found something here That's definitely not what it would look like What if it's more like a shockwave that shoots you upwards whenever you land on it Kind of like a speaker And makes a loud wong sound I think that could work well, let me try that Is Bromance coming along? Today is a little bit slow, that's partially because I'm half distracted with all the comments I'm getting right now He's a really strong astrobot, since he has a squid octopus head, it would be a bit nick in it. The ice cannon, like an ice cannon shoots lasers. Well I don't even know that it would shoot lasers or anything like that. Oh I see, it's just an actual squid. Okay, that looks very very cool. We'd have to make sure they only come from like three directions or two directions so you can actually see them all. Or even one direction. But then how do you damage him? This is a very cool concept though, I do like it. Hmm. There's something at the blank wall. Throwing stuff, which is a little awkward in Mario 64 I think. That should really be minimized. Also are there any indicators on how any obtainable munitions? Umm, you get teased with some. You see the star at the top of the rocket and you see paths you can take. So the idea is that while you do star 1, you get teased with all the other stars so you can find them. Hmm.  Shitpost from Exalas, a warrior's taco stand. There's one very stupid shitpost that I am going to make with Doriel and Aza. But I don't know if you're gonna think it's funny or not. You may think it's cringe. Hmm, this doesn't really look like a boombox either. It's so quantized. Nothing Aza, don't worry. Whenever I use a texture like this or this. This is a really nice speaker, I wanna use this texture. Hmm. So it doesn't have any plants, nope. What the fuck. Hmm. And it's so low res, but I guess that's kind of fitting for N64. Hmm. You didn't know I was streaming a workflow? I don't stream that much, just a little bit. Ugh, this looks like shit. I don't think this is gonna look good, but let's try it.  Don't ask why I have that picture of Joe Biden, it's important. I'm sure Biomec can find a better texture for what I'm trying to convey in here. Send it to me. No. This texture is... It conveys the idea, I think that's enough. For now. Hmm. Hmm. We don't need this anymore. A lighting effect on this maybe? I like the blue here. Hmm. Hmm. Let's just look for the textures and see if we get inspired to do something, maybe. Hello, someone. Welcome to the stream. Someone, I've been watching anime this week. It's actually kind of epic. You were right about it. In case you guys don't know, someone is the biggest anime fan I know. That's why I'm telling him. Yippie. My mom just told me that I can drink cola. Yippie. Yippie. Demon Sokka? Is there one without Sokka? No. It could be this, and then we have the blue stripe lined up with... And the stripe lined up with blue. I think that should work. I'm just gonna edit this texture a little bit. Another concept for if the boss for no reason. Let's see. The boss would be floating in the sky. What? Oh, I see. I can't really see what this is to be honest.    It just looks like a red dot to me that says the boss would be floating in the sky. Is that not the image you wanted to send me? And now you just look foolish for no reason. That makes this so much funnier. So I was thinking something like this maybe. The glow here looks kind of sick. Try this. Oh gosh, this is a mess. Oh, I see. Yeah, I don't know. It seems pretty complicated. Look. Looks like a Sonic boss. It's a platform.  Hmm. Okay. Hmm. Oh, the concept again. I see. I see. I'm assuming that's going to work out. Not like that. This is too many triangles. I don't want to do all that just for something you can't even see really. I think that's just a bad idea. Let's try something else. Ah, that could work. Like so. I think that makes the light effect look like something. I am not struggling with topology now. I was just trying to get a cool looking effect. Yeah, that kind of works. And then I need a rim here. I think it might look better without the light in here at the rim. Kind of like that. Yeah, I don't think it looks particularly good, but it will work for now. And this will be the collision map. Very much just the simplified version of it. Making it brighter when it launches Mario is an option. I don't know. I've seen this one. I have not. Interesting. I don't think we can make a full monorail like that just because that's like a lot of detail on it, a lot of polygons spent on something that doesn't really have a gameplay like that. It can't be radially symmetry because it's going to be on a rail. So, it doesn't work, unfortunately. Oops, did I not export this to the right folder? TinyHitChannel, of course. I don't want to make that mistake. How do you get infinite coins there? I mean, it's not really an issue, but how do you do that? It's going to be back on at all times until I see what that sign does when it tries to drop an S-train under via rift. If you dodge it, the camera pans back to the squid. It's in frame. If you kick the S-train in its direction, it becomes measured and hits the squid in the face. Ah, I see, I see. I don't like, I don't know if I like waiting for a damageable face like this. I think I would much prefer it if you had to do platforming to get to it. What if instead of a meteorite falling from the top, instead you had to climb over some platforms to get to it? And like, the more damage it has, the more tentacles it spawns and the more it's using out its lasers or something like that. Use the flag somehow and it spawns infinite coins. Oh, it's supposed to just spawn like 20. Did you somehow underfloor it? Did you grab the flag at the very bottom maybe and it caused infinite coins to spawn? Where did you grab it? If it is an underfloor, then I just fixed it. I don't have a video, so it's hard to tell what happened, but I think at any rate I just fixed it. Then I just deleted it from the TikTok log and I just deleted it from the wrong folder. I am so distracted today. Hello, Raidey. Raidey Schmaidey. Howdy Schmowdey. Yeah, I see what you mean, the fight your fight. It's just I hate waiting around doing nothing. What if instead you had to like attack the tentacles somehow? The tentacles that attacks you with? Like you punch them or something? 2, 1, 3. Need to be easier to defeat though. It could be something like you punch a tentacle and then it becomes damageable somehow. It's funny that this is still called casino when the theme is close. This is just a level. No. Huh? No. Yes, it is. It's windy Stoney today. I can use the angle from Mario now, that's fine. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Well, if there are spikes around the area, you have to place the attacks right above the spikes and you can damage the boss.  I don't know if that's fun. This is like using the environment again. Yeah, I think a big squid can work. Oh. I see some bubbles start to appear. Start hopping on the bubbles. That's funny, a penguin. Let's see, the further out you are, the slower it should go. For sure. But, much exactly. So if the distance is like 4,000. Let's select normal speed, 0 maybe. Hmm. Let's just try this, see where it goes. I can still adjust this value here. What if I just do this? Not Toad, no, not you too. I've made a program in PHP, but I don't know any PHP. I need something other than opacity here. Okay, that works. Okay.  My platforms are not here. I don't know why. Cool, cool, cool. What did I do wrong? I'm not calling the edit function? I am not calling the edit function. Well, that worked basically perfectly first try. But the platforms are so small that landing on them is going to be pretty difficult. Oh no, I'm moving around. Oh, I know why. I guess I'm using opacity uselessly. That's fine. We can just override opacity afterwards. No, advance on most emulators too. I'm programming my game in a way where it's also fine on emulators. That's good, Daniel. Do you study computer science or something? I forgot to grab Tom Nobunaga. Alright, in that case I fixed your bug. So don't worry about it. I thought I fixed this just now. Oh, I thought I did the wrong one. Now if you grab it from the bottom you will get zero coins. It's because it was underflowing. Okay, this is pretty cool. Although this is going to be so shocking when you land on it for the first time. You are just going to fly off. Maybe this was a bad idea a while back. You would think these like carry you. But then they do that. I think we can't do that. What the fuck was that wall? Make it look bouncy? I tried. But that wouldn't help you though. There's nothing to prepare you for that. I don't know about Moevi. Move the center vertex up and down. That could help. Yeah, it would have to be earlier. We could use something more similar to these platforms down here. Oh, we could use the bouncer platforms. You know the spherical bouncers that we use? We could put that there. Hello, Innovator. Either way, to be honest, today I think I'm keeping the stream short. I want to make sure the demo release and video goes fine. Someone said there's something inaccurate in the video and I will investigate and fix that. So I will see you guys next stream. Hopefully soon. I don't actually know when.
