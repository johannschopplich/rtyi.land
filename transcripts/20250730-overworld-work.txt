Sorry I'm late, I had to take a shit. Where are my people at? Hello ED Dragon Cape Man, hello Basketball Fan, hello Zayna. Hello Hans Mayer. We updated to a new version of F3DX 3 today, which unfortunately means that we can no longer use Project 64 to play our game. But Eclab is on it, he is fixing it. So hopefully one day Project 64 will work again, but for now it's NEMU, we can only use NEMU in Real Land 64 right now. Sorry I wanted to check my one change and then we'll get to the overworld. Audio is glitching, how so? NEMU doesn't like when you tap out. I think that's the Windows 11 bug. Yeah it should work in parallel. Unfortunately the Windows 11 audio mixer is also fucked, so I cannot adjust the audio of my emulator. I don't know how they messed up the audio mixer, it just doesn't work around half the time. Okay wait, that is a little bit ugly. Yeah I'm gonna keep working on this after stream. Any OST wishes today? You know what, actually I'm feeling one GEM OST today. I want the N64 version. And find it, oh wait. You see my 2025 release? I'm not shooting for anything, it comes out when it's done. This sounds like fuckin' Spongebob. Punch me boy. Is that what he says? So, actually we can use Project 64 still, but none of the text renders fine. Not sure why that happens, like it looks like this. That also means the dialogue won't show up. That was something weird there. Am I the only one that saw that? Am I going insane? They should look less energetic. Let's give him a less energetic animation. I don't know how to read it in Mr. Krabs, I didn't watch English SpongeBob. I don't know how to read it in Mr. Krabs. I don't know how to read it in Mr. Krabs, I didn't watch English SpongeBob. I don't know how to read it in Mr. Krabs, I didn't watch English SpongeBob. I don't know how to read it in Mr. Krabs, I didn't watch English SpongeBob. I don't know how to read it in Mr. Krabs, I didn't watch English SpongeBob. That's nasty. Does anyone have ideas on how to make people stop asking for release dates? I was asked two times today, which is not a lot compared to a normal day. It is a constant and annoying background noise. I'm both a suffering dingus. Making video games is suffering. I think we should maybe scale this up a little bit. If they make Releasio 1.5, they're just gonna ask even more first. They want Releasio is the thing. All the Releasio PC port would go pretty hard. Oh, we should use that in just a little... Is anyone gonna vote for F3? No. When did Releasio release? That must have been like half a year before Lost Impact, right? Is it 0.64? Ah, I guess four months before Lost Impact. Wait. No, this is like right before Lost Impact. I don't know why TomatoBird isn't an author on that. I don't think he authored anything on it. Do you think one day you'll ever touch up on Remastered? I don't know anything about the world you build, it's just a little janky. No, it's not worth it. It'd be much better to just make a new game from the ground up. Be less work and likely also be more fun. I was thinking maybe to make like a Lost Impact supercut, where I only recreate the fun starts of Lost Impact into a shorter hack. I think that could work. Although it would probably have to be an assembly hack. Guess I'm what makes the hack of Lost Impact. This should probably just be its own function. Oh, it can't be because of the flag. I guess it's easier this way. Branded coins tend to crystal keys. I think it's fine, actually, it's too much of a problem. This is pretty stupid code. There are ideas you love, though. No, it's not. Look at this. Oh, now it works! But around 50% of the time, instead of apps, there's nothing here. Only the reset button. All of these don't appear. So clicking it on a taskbar doesn't fix it. It's like this part that's broken. It's not a visual bug, it's the thing that just doesn't work. Oh, I see. I guess it's just a bug. I guess it's just a bug. I guess it's just a bug. I don't think I want the you are missing out text. Or actually, maybe.  Honestly, this feels like something we will reuse over and over, so let's actually make this a function. Let's make this a function. Let's make this a function. Let's make this a function. It's not terrible, Win11 is. It's not terrible, Win11 is. Do I need anything else? I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't know. I don't think she understands what I'm doing. I don't know if I've been a very social person anyway, so something like that wouldn't matter to me. I don't know if I've been a very social person anyway, so something like that wouldn't matter to me. Why are you so rude to me, huh? Why are you going to be so rude? What are you working on? We are working on the opening to Crystal Caves, or Rainbow Grotto. I'm also working on a system to make it easier for any NPC in the game to just talk to Mario. I'm also working on a system to make it easier for any NPC in the game to just talk to Mario. I'm also working on a system to make it easier for any NPC in the game to just talk to Mario. Yes, we're creating the economy right now. Some people would ban me for that, but you chill. Oh, yeah. I guess I am a very stoic person. I think it was 484. Okay, we gotta make sure the Bob-omb shop still works. And then we gotta make sure that the new shop works. Which we actually can't. Oh, coins! We gotta farm coins. Maybe I am a little bit of a how-is-cyber-bullying-real-ha-ha-ha-ha-just-close-your-eyes-bro type person, because I can just do that. As long as it doesn't affect how much money I make from YouTube, I really don't care what people say about me on the Internet. I cheated. I found a pretty bad bug in the collision engine today. One, it made it so that a lot of ceilings wouldn't work. That's fixed, which is very good. Two, it would also make it so that too many triangles were being iterated, and I didn't fix that part yet. And the reason I didn't fix that part is because I want to do a BVH collision soon anyway, so my fix would be a wasted effort. I don't know, I see a lot of people just still be very invested in what people on the Internet say or think about them, even if they did grow up on the Internet. I think the way I am is just some kind of anti-social personality disorder that makes me not care, which is very practical to have. Now we're going to e-stack areas to get more coins. Is this hardware emulation? No, this is software emulation. Is it me, or does it look more reddish, this area here? Not sure. Sure. Right now I just kind of need to get 200 coins. Which I could cheat, but you know what, I like playing this game. Well then, I guess, fuck me. But it's so fun to move Mario in this game. Wait, what? What are you talking about? There's two ways to understand the words you're using. The first is when you say software emulation, you mean like, are we using software? When you say hardware emulation, the first is, are we using software to emulate a hardware? The other is, are we using hardware to emulate a hardware, you know? When people say hardware emulation, they usually mean like, are you using a hardware to emulate a hardware? Which does exist nowadays, they're called FPGAs. I do recognize how to do that. Okay, all I needed was 300 coins, and then I need to save the game. Let's save the game by connecting the red circle. Can you believe people were like, seriously being like, oh there's not enough platforming in this level? Did you just fucking see me schmoof? How is there not enough platforming? Unbelievable. What language are you using to mod? C. And a little bit of assembling. And Python too, if you count the Blender stuff. That did not work. That did not work. Keep in mind, the text will not render due to an emulation bug. Hello Liliana. You should not open it. Oh, he talked to me too fast again, I don't like that. That was a bug for sure. Yo, why are you doing that bro? I guess it's getting set to action. Oh, it's action status doesn't reset. I see. Hello dashboard. Hey, it works. Okay, let's see if the mice work too. Okay, emulation just ended. I assume that's also an emulation bug. Field parameter gain erase? That's what FPGA stands for. I had no idea. Uh... What? Yeah, you see what it's doing here? That is the emulation bug. What? Okay, it's not doing anything except offer a trade though. Okay. Do the mice have like a special text for their voice? I feel like they should. Something like this. Okay. Do you want me to make this into a real controversy when it comes out? Uh, sure. Okay. The 497. 987. Cooler. Not missing out. And... Mouse. That's not great. Can you suggest for keeping an image of a painting while it remains perfect? What do you think of tinkering with the paintings to have four images? You don't know? Can you show me what the DS paintings look like at full resolution? I don't know what LBP music is. Mouse. No, not even close, Marty. What? That time it just worked? Why did it bug out before? Okay. Okay, so what needs to happen next is as soon as you do the trade, which costs 300 coins, which is perfect, that's what we saw. The mice have to start going crazy and hammer away at the crystal wall in front of them. So first we gotta make the crystal wall. I think 300 coins is like a fair price for opening the third course, right? Okay. We gotta write the text for them too. Blink does work. Oh my... No, he shouldn't say. Nah, nah, the mice are friends, we can't do that. So much work. So little motivation. Who doesn't know this? They're not a thousand polygons, but they are pretty high poly. They're not a thousand polygons, but they are pretty high poly. Do a discard? A discard works. It's mainly like 2 times the original, the N64 ones. Some of these are unused. Let's see. How many pixels is this? 128x128 maybe? Why do they look so jpegged? Huh? They look horrible. What's going on in Worm's Fortress here? Do you see that? Anyway, yeah, this looks like you'd best split it up into 4 paintings. And then make it a 127x128. Actually, no, that doesn't work. Is 4 enough? I don't think 4 is enough. Or maybe it is. If you do 31x128 slices, and then have a 125x128 in total. It's a bit in-depth. I don't think that's a useful concept here. I don't know. How's the mouse going to ask for money? I don't know. It should reference cheese somehow. Yeah, it looks like someone made a jpeg. That's probably not what it looks like in-game. But it makes it hard to tell what's going on in the image. Like McDonald's? Last time I was there, I liked it. But it's been probably like 15 years. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea, man. Is that not too cheesy to ask for? I don't know. What if they also just open up after 70 stars is a little easter egg? Fuck it. I don't know. Hello, SuperM. I don't know. You guys want to see something cool I made? Wait, I can't show you right now. Too bad. Maybe I can show you in my Biobank DMs here. Look at this. How cool is that? How much does this game cost to repaint like a CineDev? How much is a CineDev paid? I don't know. No, the light. I don't know. She needs to conduct a business with you. She needs to conduct a business with you. Is that an emigrating status? Yes! That actually happens in two areas in that level. I don't know. There's a problem here. And that is that if you already have it, he should just instantly thank you for the trades. I don't know. I don't know. I don't like that. Don't know why this area is so cool. I don't know if there's two games to see those. I don't know. Oh, they look a lot better at this scale. So after this, they need to start fucking hammering. Like crazy. I don't know. Oh yeah, I'm a programmer that doesn't really care much about readability. And I am mostly good with logic. So... You will see me write code in a weird way sometimes. Because it's like, I don't need to make sure that someone stupider than me can read it. Does that make sense? I don't know. I don't know what this does. I don't know. So yeah, I make $7,000 a month at 1,700 hours. Okay, so... And well, I guess I don't work full-time or not UI.io. But I guess in the end we can say this is like maybe 3 and a half years of me working on this full-time. Plus a little bit of commissioning people. Let's see. Let's just pretend it's 4 years. How much is that? 12 by 7 by 4. The budget then would be $336,000 for this whole game. Which is pretty cheap as far as N64 games go, compared to Mario 64. Coding a game? I am coding a game. And also 3D modeling it. And also designing it. So right here we need a crystal wall that fits in here. I mean, I don't mind readable code and there is value in it. But there is this whole clique of like readable code fanboys, as I will call them. That are just like really stupid. That are just like... You cannot write good code if I find the code hard to read. That Coding Jesus guy is like a bigger fan of that. When I saw his Pirates of the Video. He was being extremely stupid with it. That guy is such a crypto. You don't use Git? I use Git as a backup system. I don't really use Git to like find errors in what I'm doing. Because... I mean, it would be useful for that. But it's also kind of a skill issue if you need Git for that. Eh. Is that a squishy? I'm surprised Texas is only half of it in Sweden. I thought it was a lot more. Oh, nice squishy. I hope you liked it. The F3. Readable code fanboys are equivalent to Linux nerds. Linux nerds? I just think it's interesting that... There's like a whole culture around coding. Where there's like people that are like fanboys. That are not actually coders. I don't know. I don't use Microsoft Blender plugin. Because that doesn't test my code. But it also plays with fucking default Mario 64 physics. Which are horrendous. A company who drifted the honest mechanic of a readable. And they made them think that there's Roblox games too. And I see Roblox all over the place. I was specifically talking about Coding Jesus. I don't know if you know that guy. He has an Instagram thing. That's where I know him from. Where he gets people on calls. And then asks them really obscure. And irrelevant programming questions. That have nothing to do with being able to write good code. He will ask them something like. If I write this line of code. What will this return? And it's like. Who gives a fuck? What are you testing here? Whether they know operator precedence to that level. And then when they get it wrong. He calls them stupid basically. And then he made this video about. Programming things you should be doing. And how Pirate Software doesn't do them in his code. And why Pirate Software is a terrible programmer. Which he is a terrible coder. But that video was nonsense. US tax is significantly lower than it is in Sweden. Don't worry. I'm surprised though. It is only 50% in Sweden. I thought it would be like 65%. No, I don't know CUDA. Let's get some crystal material. From the crystal cave level. I heard of some dumb clean code. Reduce myself minimize nesting. I mean that's a good thing. Of course it is always better. If your code is easier to read right? Like if you're not sacrificing anything. To make your code easier to read. Sure go for it. But if you're sacrificing time. To make your code easier to read. Then it's like you don't have to do it. But I mean it would be nice. For the next person if you did. I guess that's a contest interview. No I think he's just a grifter. I think he is just like. An average programmer. Who is. Running this whole thing. To like pretend. He is like a great programmer. And get programming fanboys. To like cheer for him. Like I don't think his target audience. Is people that know programming at all. Like I don't think his target audience. Is people that know programming at all. I think it's people that. Don't know programming. And. If he were to hear this and respond to it. He would probably be saying something like. Of course that is. Like my channel is about teaching programming. But it's not. Your channel is about. Giving people the feeling of like. Being better than other programmers. With like really stupid measuring sticks. Which I guess that's the issue. Hello Mariah the human. Yep I've been streaming for a long time. Is he calling in programming Jesus. No coding Jesus. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. Is he calling in programming Jesus. No coding Jesus. Not programming Jesus. Shit I didn't look at the combiner. Oops. I think he just wanted to bankrupt the pirate software. Of course. But I knew him before that. Because he shows up in my Instagram reel. When I'm taking a shit sometimes. So this is actually something he has consistently been doing. This is not something that he started doing because of pirate software. You cannot call him a grifter for that. Like he is passionate about this. However this is his niche. I don't know if he is passionate about it. I mean he is probably passionate about it. Otherwise it would be much easier things to make money with. Oh no. My blender window moved over here. Fuck. I can't get it off. There we go. Oh it's not even an inf map. Interesting. Okay. I'm just coming back to setup here. Strip us of the art of programming. And the art of programming is to grumble at musicians then. Counting programming and art. It's kinda weird. There is a little bit of creative expression in there. Yes. But. In a way it's closer to building a house or something. I think he might be employed. I'm not trying to say that he is not employed in that field. Yes. I think he might be employed. I'm not trying to say that he is not employed in that field. Fuck. I am also saying that he is overrepresenting his skills. To me he very much seems like he is just an average dude. Who acts very elite. To get people to think he is very elite. I mean I am sure you have seen it before, right? People that act very, like with a lot of elitism. To like, make themselves seem part of that elite group. I have definitely seen it before. Common human behaviour. Should there be beef between sonic modos and arm modos? No? Thank you Green Dino. Are you going to make your engine open source? YES! Do you know of people in many games that make perfect game programmers? I don't know what a quantitative degree is. But I have definitely seen them like... I mean he has this thing where he says you can get cracked. And then being cracked is like you are good at programming. All you need to do is buy my horse. Does AI make you a better programmer but you never learned? That's an issue. Because AI at the moment is not a good programmer. So if the horizon of your ability is also the horizon of AI's ability. Probably kind of bad. Do you have to develop for the N64 set your backlighting caper SGI workstation? That's crazy. Sure Green Dino but I'd have to redo that every time I change the physics on my Mario 64 game. Which still happens a fair bit. Kind of stupid to do that. My combiner reset. Hello Zemus. Oh nice hello Graham. I will show what you did on stream. Graham has reached out to me. Saying he wants to help with some 3D models for RTYI. Let me just show you what he's made so far. He's already made a couple models. So first we got, oh nevermind this one is deleted. We got Boonart's wife. Boozette. Or Buette or something. I don't think I've given her a proper name yet. But it looks amazing. We got the Nap E-Nut. That will eat you if you try to escape the overworld. I probably have to change the shaders a little bit. Because he's transparent and transparency is a bit messed up on the N64. That one's good too. And then we have, oh this one is not going to be in the game. But this is also a great model. It's a 332 triangle. So this would work really well on the N64. The texturing is really nice. Yeah that's exactly what I'm talking about. He makes this arbitrary measuring stick. Of like, you need to learn these random operator precedence. And that's what makes you a good programmer. And then it's like, yeah if you can't live up to my arbitrary assessment. Of what makes you a good programmer. Then you fail. Like imagine if I sat, your name needs to be Michael IRL. To be a good programmer. And the closer your name is to that, the better you are. That would be completely ridiculous. By a very similar principle. Okay. We're getting a blooper right now. Okay, we have a blooper in the game actually. But if yours is better, I might just replace him. One of my friends sent that to me. Now this is a stupid name, I sent it wrong. It's the best name, it's a great name. How long have you been programming for? Well I kinda started programming when I was like 12 or so. On my TI-84. I used to program video games in class. One time I wrote a program in class that could solve the entire math test we had. And everyone in my class got an A. Because we were allowed to use calculators in math class, obviously. It was pretty good. Oh, baby bloopers. Okay, we don't have baby bloopers. We just have normal bloopers. Well, and then really, probably programming. I started with like 17, I think. And I started in MIPS assembly. Farjo is a pretty good guy. Farjo is a pretty good guy. When can I start programming on something you didn't get that I was going to get? Two eggs and I should most likely put fries in the back. When can I start programming on something you didn't get that I was going to get? Two eggs and I should most likely put fries in the back. I'm trying to think of a very stupid thing that's equivalent to... I'm having a hard time. You know what, we can just import it like this. You know what, we can just import it like this. I've got a VarioBest and SuperMario64 lunch. Which one's SuperMario64 lunch? Which one's SuperMario64 lunch? He's the boss of world 7, I think. He's the boss of world 7, I think. He is kind of a not great boss though. He is kind of a not great boss though. Can people talk to chatgpt? Dude, I found this out yesterday. You know how some people You know how some people they think chatgpt and I were pushing the frontier of science when we were making new concepts that have never existed? And they make themselves schizophrenic And they make themselves schizophrenic by having the YesManBot agree with them and pretending it's a smart bot. I found out yesterday that the old CEO of Uber is doing that with chatgpt and physics. Clearly, first of all, we noticed I didn't realize this before even super rich people, tech billionaires are completely stupid. I thought you needed some amount of self-reflection and intelligence to get there but evidently not. And also that's fucking insane, right? I think when we grow up when the next generation grows up they are going to tell their parents not to become schizophrenic with chatgpt the same way that we as a generation had to tell our parents that their overseas lover stuck in Nigeria who's also a good looking and famous actor and doesn't actually go on a date with them if they send him $10,000. Exactly, Xana! I thought, I generally thought there was some sort of correlation between being successful and IQ and there probably is but it's clearly much weaker than I had thought. Never had to tell your parents that? I'll just wait until one of them dies. Okay, I shouldn't be saying that. But a lot of old people just, you know, they get catfished online and send all their money away. I miss my Nigerian friends. I can't believe he ghosted you. Who's pinging me? Why, Christoph? I'm streaming. My friends have credit card phobia. Like they're too scared to get a credit card. That's also crazy. I wish I could get like 200 credit cards. I would get 200 credit cards and max all of them out to invest in stocks and then sell all my stocks and then sell all my stocks right before the credit card bills are due and then like pay it back and then I just have like free interest for a month. Unfortunately, they don't let me open infinite credit cards. Yeah, it looked like that. He said he was talking to CGPD and pushing it to the boundaries of like quantum physics that are known and then push even further beyond where they found new physics. Some shit like that. He calls it VIPE PHYSICS. I'm sure Jasper will help you back soon. Just like 15,000 more dollars. Did you ever hear a game that explains that issue? The game is not just a fucking straw man. You ever notice how like so many movies, it's just like the movie director or writer or whoever the fuck making up a straw man and then winning against the straw man. It's like all superhero movies are just shower arguments. Damn, you have like 5 minutes of lags in your honor. Holy shit. Did you ever hear an old and outdated and really bad chess computer beat our most advanced AI? No, it didn't. What are you talking about? There's no way an outdated and really bad chess computer beat our most advanced AI. It's just like a bunch of fucking fucking stupid an outdated and really bad chess computer beat our most advanced AI. That is literally just a lie. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? The AI wasn't good to be built at chess. It wasn't just like, oh fucking, what a surprise. Do it. Yeah. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Did you know, actually, like just recently, our most advanced computer lost to a rock? It was in a, in a, uh, killing people competition. The computer just had no shot. Almost AI doesn't even understand Vagma, true. Can't do Vagma at all. He lost to a rock? These computer shits ain't special, true. Did you know my little daughter beat Muhammad Ali in like a boxing match? Because Muhammad Ali is dead, like he just lost by default. That's the type of shit you guys are saying in chat right now. Actually don't know if he's dead, but dude, I fucking hope he's dead or I'm gonna look so stupid right now. Can an AI count to a jillion? This is actually crazy, dude. Our most advanced AI can't count to a jillion, but like an N64 could. What is this, dude? Like 30 years of tech advancement and we only went backwards? It can't count to a jillion? Oh, this is the adventure, uh, guys, what was my Twitch name, I forgot. 90% of the- I'm surprised it's only 90%, I thought it was probably closer to like 99.99%. Dude, how long is this song? Bran theme extendo, we've been listening to this for 11 minutes. I need out of here. I don't know Zelda, if we can use AI to replace a person, imagine the cost we need to like keep one person running. You know, if AI cuts personal costs in half, we can cut like global carbon emissions almost in half, which is removing all the people, if you consider that. Like yeah, how much does it take like one AI, one AI prompt is like a teaspoon of water, but like a burger is like 4000 liters of water, and you need probably like three or four burgers to keep a person alive. That's like 20,000 liters. With that you could have like at least probably 2 million AI searches in a day. Think about that. That is a ridiculous barzigona. I mean obviously that's impossible, right? Like why would it be possible to distill the entire thing out of it? Isn't the whole idea that it compresses data? Obviously it's a lossy compression, so it should actually be completely impossible to distill the entire thing. Unless I'm misunderstanding this. I don't think I am. Right, I know if I was to make a small company, for what? Okay, so now the grotto should despawn once we have that. Next all we need to do is make it so that once you buy the thing, you are ready to go. So this needs to happen after action three. Action after trades. This is not good. This is not gonna work. Shit. Need to do it differently. Okay but what's the company for? You mean just make a company and then what? File tax reports once a year? That seems useless. I don't want to file tax reports for no reason. What are you trying to get me to do? More tax reports for you? I think there's an unlimited amount. What if you just made like two million companies and kept the tax office so busy that they couldn't possibly keep up with that? Like okay, imagine you're Jeff Bezos and you find the smallest country in the world. And just for the fucking fun of it, you open like two million companies in there. Would that country just go down? Would you just put whatever the fuck you felt like in there? Think about it. Did you see F3? I made F3! My favorites? I think maybe the Maruka Double Dash one with the N64 stuff. Or Amped Up. Amped Up could be cool too, but I'm not sure it actually runs well on N64. Okay, we need some kind of way to detect whether the trade has gone through. What if we just do this? Fuck it. This should be fine. I think. Oh good, this should be fine. I think. So, animation of killing the wall. It's right here. Super Shadow in P6 mod? I kinda wanna play that too, the P6. That's Project O6, right? Like Sonic O6 but fixed. I've never played Sonic O6, but I don't think it's as bad as everyone says. That's why I wanna try it. I'm saying it's probably not as bad as everyone says, based on literally fucking nothing by the way. Wait, it's done? Project O6 is finished? You guys are talking about as if it's finished. I don't wanna play it before it's not fully finished. I don't wanna play it. Oh shit, nice. I am looking forward to that. Someone needs to tell me once it's finished so I can play it. Wait, you made all the bosses in Project O6? Every single one of them? That's kinda crazy. I'm surprised all the big mod creators are here. It's very surprising. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is beautifully stupid. Great. So that's one thing I missed. They might not need Move Angle Jaw. Face Jaw to Move Jaw. Face Jaw is set to Move Jaw. Action is 4. Okay, I actually don't see it. Uh oh. I don't think about that Zelda. I don't know modding communities outside Mario 64, so how can I possibly answer that question? This is Luna's Project 64. It's the same mod that a bunch of people work on. Eclab sent me this version here. It has some nice fixes. Okay, it almost works. It doesn't set the other mouse to also do that, and I know why. I used the wrong behavior. And this is the wrong location. And I should be exploiting this level once. And while this is happening, I need some camera shake. Why does this keep happening? Shit, I forgot a thing. We gotta do this. And then move to sub-500 coordinates. I think it's easiest to just copy that part. So, this will not be doing that, actually. No, I'm not interested in GameCube games. I mean, no, I am interested in GameCube games, but there's just... No point in me doing another thing after Mario 64. Okay, I see. What am I doing? I don't need to shake. Now we should have a diesel discount scene here. Maybe. The thing is, now that I have a family and a child, money is always going to be a consideration. So most likely I am going to not necessarily do what I want to do, but rather what is going to bring me the most money. It is the unfortunate reality. Okay, well, they are mining. I just did the wrong action. Same here. I think we are all good now. I think I will do that Dark Ways, like, it makes a lot of sense. Because I want to do it, and also financially. There's a bunch of cool opportunities in the N64 space still coming up, though. I don't think we'll be running out of N64 stuff to do anytime soon. Okay. Now we need some VFX, so that that actually makes some sense. Let me think, what kind of VFX would you guys think makes sense here? We should definitely have, like, stars appear when they hit the thing. Like, clank, clank, clank. On the animation frame. Jetta. Jetta is not so easy to do. It looks a little bad, the way there's, like, nothing above it. The way the thing just goes down. I don't think it should go down like that. I think it going down like that is a mistake. But if it's Jetta, it's assumed to have volume, so that also might be a bit of an issue. Yeah, I agree, Noroboro. No, Zelda, I'm just streaming to Twitch, don't worry. The YouTube views are not real. They're just bots pretending they exist. We backward-walk-past-the-mice-like-the-clock-town-guard. Yeah. Breaks that appear over time, and then triangle-breaking particles, basically. But that's... that looks so wrong, right? That makes it feel like it's a plane of paper, not like it's actually full of crystals. What are you trying to figure out? How to make the VFX look when you actually break the thing. Because, obviously, going down looks terrible. Like right here, when you destroy this. When you pay them to destroy this. We could have them carve out, like, a path in the middle. How about an effect that looks like this? I gotta make sure to edit my Twitter DMs. Not sure how to make that look in 3D. I mean, I can definitely make little crystal pieces just fly out. We can do the Pokémon approach where we fade the screen to black and then you see the aftermath of it. Actually, no, that's also Breath of the Wild in terms of the kingdom. I don't think many of them do Mirabilis. The black recent lines are drawn by the game. Like, the games have to program that in. I can do that, but I feel like that would make this look so thin. Like it's not actually filled with crystals. But maybe that is the best solution here. Alright, let's look into that then, I guess. See ya. Let's try a Polygon Explosion, don't worry. We'll try a few things here. First of all, we gotta sync this to the animation frame. So on frame 21. This is fucked up, but it is what it is. Let's see, how high up in the air are we here? Fuck, how do I move the dot in the new Blender version? Anyone know? I guess it kinda looks like 143. Hold off on this. 73. This should hit it a few times, then stop hitting it, and then there are dynamic crinkles and rumbles, and then the world falls over like a sheet of paper. This ain't paper, Mario boy. We need a custom version of this tool. I don't like it. This is four. And I think that is it. Triangle shrines. So now we have a bunch of triangles spawned. Next we need to spawn them along the position of our thing here. Which is... Uh... Next up is 230.f Then next down is 460. Then next down minus 460.f Okay. Yeah, we're gonna try to make it shatter. Are billboards like the benches at the entrances? Um, no. Yeah, I guess that was just a guideline they had for the N64. Does this function exist? Nope. What the fuck is this code? Huh? Huh? Stupid-ass vanilla 64 code. Oh well. Hello, AlexDVZ. And then... How long is this? How long is this, guys? What's the math? 2500? 1000? 30? 1000, okay. ... And then the angle is like 45 degrees. Okay. Well, actually more like 30 degrees, so... So... Yeah, I can't be wrong. True-er. Alright, let's see how it goes. I'm half-expecting this to be completely awful. Oh, the triangle breaking particles are nice. Whoa, did you guys see that? The last frame? ... ... Let's see this again. ... ... Okay, I see. ... Can you add gravity to the triangles? I mean, yes. ... Yeah, the triangle explosion looks pretty horrendous. What even is going on here? ... ... ... ... ... It's very hard to see what's going on here because of the video quality. ... But yes. Okay, we first need to get the color right. Let me check where the color is wrong. ... AnimStatus 5, okay. ... The L is too big. ... ... There are the half-gravity, we just need to set it. That's good. ... ... ... ... Okay, I'm definitely spawning them along the wrong axis too. ... And they're too big. I think the color is kinda wrong. ... I can fix the color, it's not a problem. But I don't wanna fix the color if I don't think it's gonna look good. ... Yeah, that's just the wrong axis, man. ... ... These are too big, maybe. ... I don't know how much I can further reduce this without just looking stupid. ... ... Not starting from the center? Really? ... I don't think that's true. ... Hmm. ... ... What do you mean, Fudges? ... ... ... ... You can kinda see them being along the line here. ... Hmm. ... I mean, logically speaking from what I'm seeing here, the logical conclusion would be that I have to rotate at 90 degrees, but that doesn't make sense to me. But I will just try it anyway despite my bad judgment, because I'm confused by this. ... Oops. Huh. That does seem to work. Too bad my angle is shit and I couldn't see it. Wonk. Wonk. ... Honestly, it's not terrible. I just don't like how not evenly distributed these are. What if you distributed them evenly? We could do, like, a 7x4 arrangement. Let's try that. With a little bit of randomness. Yes, Zelda. ... ... ... Let's see how this goes. Get screened, I know. No, there's definitely going to be less than that. We never want there basically to ever be some popup. One, two, wonk. Oh, okay. That has some charm to it. ... We could even do more if we wanted. Like, nine and six, and maybe make them a little taller. Add some randomness to it, too. ... What's the random.build.run0 function? Random.ath.run0. ... What's the star effect? No? A lot of white space? I don't know what that means. Oh no, debugging. We're programming new stuff. Right now we're trying to make an animation for this. Okay. Definitely gotta fix the color of those triangles. Let's do that next. I'm hopeful for this one here. ... One, two, three, four, five. That's nine. That's eight. If you think instead of bigger shots, then shoot out more violence to give it variety. We can randomize it a little bit. No problem at all. But let's get the color right first. ... What's a good orange? Like so, maybe? ... ... Random. ... That, and then the forward well as well. ... Redefinition. Oops. No, let's just release the same alpha everywhere. That's silly. ... I have very little thoughts on Switch 2. I haven't thought about the Switch 2 in weeks. Some of these just spawn way forward, you see that? ... What if we also made them reflective? We could make them a little bit reflective. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I don't need this anymore ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Use more hard-coded lookup tables. No, I actually use less. A lot of the time, my lookup table is pretty slow ... ... and I end up removing it. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I don't think it looks great yet, I think there's still a ways to go. And we need the correct texture first. The sizes are already different, but maybe they're not different enough for you. I can make them differ quite a bit more, see if that works. Now I'm looking for a correct texture. Maybe this, Kraken Floor. Looks pretty terrible... I need like a big, I don't want like a centralised crack like that. Something like this, this is kind of nice. That'd be funny, Wykella. Well keep in mind, there's still going to be the biobank rework of this level, and he might just be like, that's too ugly for my standards, we're gonna remove it. Come on, come on, next part to the desktop, thank you. Dude, something about my startup file is fucked up. Have I not been packing data automatically for the past couple of years now, like, what? No, not for me. For me the last, I would say the last 10% is 9% of the work. Also made the cracks white, black cracks just look dirty, sure. Is this better? That was a question, I'm not sure if it's better. What if the issue is within the detail of the cracks? I haven't been including everything automatically, what have I been doing recently? Let me just make sure my things are working. I guess the save block is the last thing I need, and then the send one. This is automatically packed, okay, that's very good. Link sketch, aha. Where is the save startup file? What's the hotkey? There used to be a ctrl shift s and a ctrl u or something, there we go, okay very good. Okay what if, there's a different way to do this, you could make it so it's like multiple So what we could do is, on the first hit this happens, and on the second hit this happens. I think that would look decent. You could be right that the texture doesn't look, that the texture looks too faded. We could do something like that to solve that, so this would appear on the first and this one would appear on the second. I think, no saturation looks pretty bad too. Maybe something like so, hello Arthur Tilly. What are you casing off to? Just in general, you're casing off in general, that's allowed. Get this man banned from my discord server. Okay. Not even close. Bro, I can't hit my fucking keys, what's going on? That should work. Would it compile inefficiently? Maybe not. You know? That just compiles to a LUI and nothing else. Did you know if you define these as static and const, they will actually just be made into code and won't even be data? Now it doesn't store anything. It's pretty crazy like that. I'm just gonna hardcode these, just fuck it. How are you gonna do an author, how would you do it if not like this? Would you just make a separate array with the values you wanted? That's how I did it like a long time ago. Look, it's annoying to do and this is compiling better anyway. Alright, let's see if that works. Might not work, honestly. Bro, nothing, what is going on with you? And don't say nothing. Um, okay. That's way delayed and doesn't look very good. I wasn't playing on Mario Meltdown now. Okay, this needs to be Mega Man 1 for one. But also, why is it so delayed? I think he's like screaming for help and trying to do it that way or something. That's the only explanation for what this guy is doing. I mean Mario Meltdown looks fine, but it is based on Mario 64 movement and I cannot deal with it anymore. The people have had enough, is what I'm saying. Spring 21 just too late. What? What is happening? Why no work? I also want to add some sounds to this while I'm at it. I don't know why IntelliSense is so stupid right now. Polymetal? I guess that works. Gunshots, sure. Or armored mining sounds. I think that's a good idea too. There we go, that would have done it. Wait, Graham sent me something again? Oh shit, Graham sent me a blooper! That is a pretty nice blooper and a pretty nice baby blooper. I don't know why he sent me a blooper. I don't know why he sent me a blooper. That is a pretty nice blooper and a pretty nice baby blooper. 348 triangles, that's not bad. How does he compare to the blooper I made a while ago though? Let me check that. I think they have a very similar design. Well I guess mine's only 88 triangles, so yours is a lot more detailed. I promise they appear in an area that's already kind of laggy anyway, so I think I have to stick to this. Plus that's a lot less work for me. Oh, that's kind of nice. The game is now done, sure. Okay, something's wrong with the delay though. I don't know why in there it's a delay here, but I'm just going to subtract it out. Must be because it takes that long to start the cutscene. How come every time I go onto Sketchfab, they're trying to get me to goon? The delay was there on the first attempt too. Oh there. I think I still need dust though. Without dust it's not good. I think I'm still missing dust. You guys really think that? I think we're still missing dust. Oh wow. Let's make this one a little cheaper. Let's see what I can do here. Let's see what happens. Howdy man I don't know. Small shots for weirds. There are small shots on the mouse pickaxe, it's just hard to see. Okay, we have that here, but it's not good enough yet. Let's spawn in with much higher opacity. Much higher opacity and velocity, and it should scale a lot faster. Do they move? They don't move at all, okay that's also an issue. Let's see what we get. Hello miguelito. Okay, that's too regular. Way too regular. Hmm. Let's try that. Can I have an explosion sound? It sounds a little too soft for something that sounds exciting. Well, because I don't have a better sound right now. I'm gonna ask my loop to make a better sound, but right now I don't have one. Okay, I think this is good now. Sheesh, to make a business with you. Ultimate test, does it save? Of course I can record a sound effect, but we are on the N64 here, we are very limited on memory, like on ROM, so ideally we want to have a composed sound effect instead of just a made one. Unknown memory action is crazy. How did the inside rodents get in the cave if the game is run from the outside? Ghosts. Hmm. Yeah, this is probably why there's unknown memory action, but let me just verify that. Sound effect. A blammo? I'm not sure about that one. Yeah, that's why the initialization error. You get what I mean. Hey, it works, it's saved. All the mice are gone, we opened the cave. Cheese to do business with you. Are they mining cheese? I mean, it kind of looks like it, doesn't it? That might be an emulator bug. I was gonna show you the cheese in the level, but it is what it is. Anyway, we are done for today. Good VFX we made today, I like it. We have the entrance to this done now, so in our production thing here, this gets a plus. Plus. Plus. Each stack can also be unlocked with the bomb flow, it just blows up, I didn't do that yet. I'm gonna do that too, just make it so the bomb flow can blow it up. Anyway, I will see you guys in the next stream, most likely on Saturday. Bye bye!
