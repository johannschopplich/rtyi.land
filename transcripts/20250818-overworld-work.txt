Hello. Stopping Nuts from saying first, you just said first! Hello Daily Delphox, good to see you around. I fixed a nasty bug today, where Mario was allowed to just move through walls. It was pretty damn bad, but it's fixed! The whole bug was like a floating point error with walls. Yes, that was also the Wario clipping bug. But it was especially bad in Koopa with Koff, where you could routinely gain a lot of speed. See, no clip. Oop, we're cooked. That's a scary noise to just hear randomly. Today we're going to continue on part 3. I wonder, can you skip it without gaining crazy velocity? You can, you can do that. So many ways into the zoo. What's part 3? This is part 3 of the overworld, not the crib. This is for something else, I'm going to keep this part open. That is a cute crib though, isn't it? This is for course 9. Offstream right now I'm working on making course 9 ready for a beta test. Part 3 refers to part 3 of the overworld, which is the one where the zoo is. Any OST wishes today? Hmm. You know what they should do? They should reset Yu-Gi-Oh! to 2004. And then make the game again, but this time don't go off-rails. You should make a video game about that. Dude, there's so much potential for a Yu-Gi-Oh! video game. Imagine a Yu-Gi-Oh! game, but it works like the Pokemon games, where you collect cards, but you collect cards instead of Pokemon. I don't want to listen to just one song, but we can put on the FFXIII OST. It's taking a little bit to load. Let's see, what's next for part 3? Oh, the lighthouse! We gotta do the lighthouse next. I don't know Shift in reality, but ever since my brother watched Yu-Gi-Oh! earlier this year, I've been seeing people talk about it every day. How? See, okay, there's a good reason I talked about it. So, I was recording my next video earlier, or my next next video. I have two videos in advance prepared. And in that, I talk about language learning, because that's the sponsor. And you know the way I learned English? I had some Yu-Gi-Oh! cards that were English, so I couldn't know what they do. But then I had other cards that were in German and English, so I could compare the words between the German and English cards and infer what the only English card does. That's why I'm thinking of Yu-Gi-Oh! Hello, Versace. This is loud as fuck. It's crazy, well, I didn't always get it right. I remember Drillago, I had trouble with. Drillago's effect is, if every face-up card your opponent controls has 1600 or more attack, you can attack directly. Or it's maybe something like, if your opponent only controls face-up cards with 1600 or more, you can attack directly. I'm actually not sure which one of the two effects it is. But I remember that threw me off as a kid. So part four would be next, which is this part here with the mirror. But there is a lighthouse here that we need to finish, to finish part three. You know the coolest part about this? Look, after you go through part three, and you end up back here. It's like a circle. If you look at the world map, you start over here, and you go through here, go through here, go through the cave, and then you're back here. But now you're all the way up, and there's gonna be a spool here that you kick down, and then after you kick it down... Yeah, there's gonna be no warps in the final game. It's all just gonna be actually an open world. But what we need to think about now is actually the lighthouse here. Because I wanted the player to go into the lighthouse and activate the lighthouse. Well, there are technically loading zones, but you're not gonna see them. Like, you're gonna go here, and then instead of that happening, you're just gonna see the game, like, start up for a frame or two. So there's 15 parts of Overworld in total. Let's see how it all just goes on forever. And then later you're gonna be able to go up here. Whoa! That's a problem! I guess I fucked this up. Makes sense, actually. I wouldn't say it's preloading the area, but, like, there's gonna be no warp transition. Loading times in R64 are really short, so you're not really gonna notice. Here's another crazy connection that I haven't put in yet! Oh no! Anyway, that would lead to up there, where the star is. Yeah, the floor is supposed to exist, but it's fine that it doesn't right now. Yeah, I guess I forgot to put the swap. Anyway, we need to think about something for the lighthouse. I actually kinda fucked this up. Hmm. It's a nice lighthouse shape, right? Does that even work? So what's gonna happen is you're gonna go into the lighthouse, and you hit a switch. And after you hit a switch, the top of the lighthouse turns. So initially, the light goes maybe to this direction here, or maybe into the inside of the island. But then after you hit the switch, the light is gonna turn, and it's gonna point at the ship here. And you're gonna be able to see the ship. So yeah, we need a shape that we can actually rotate here. And I think what I made there does not work. Maybe this is good? Something like this? With like a fence around it? How would the light look like? I guess I should ask that question. You know what, why don't I just Google lighthouse? Hello, Graham? Ah. It's like window. Oh, this is nice. I want this. Thanks, Blanda. Distribute your game pitch to a publisher? Nice! I hope that goes well. Also, I think I know the reason Biobank hasn't been around much. I think he's working on a different project right now, which is totally fine. Oh, you were in Gamedev Daily Delphox? I knew you were into like 3D art, but I didn't know you were making games. Hello, ExcellentGamer? Yep, I felt like doing another stream. Lucky you. Ah, okay. I thought you did 3D art, even. An art test starting tomorrow? What is an art test? I think Zaina had to do something like that, kinda. They were giving her like a model and she had to clean it up. And I secretly helped her, so she got hired. I'm just kinda goated. Hello, Piccolos. Wow, what the fuck? Something seems wrong here. Okay, I just created them wrong the first time around. Okay. Okay, calm down. Yeah, that's kinda nice. It's just been trying to rush through. Oh, I see. Makes sense. Definitely always nice to have like a working build first. I feel the same way. Once I have like... You know, right now what I'm doing is I'm getting like a rough first version of my levels done, getting them beta tested, and then polishing them up as we go. And that feels a lot better, development-wise. You're the first one that doesn't make a pickle joke, Ace. I fucking love you. Your name is literally Pickolas, like... You know, the pickle is like the last thing we should talk about. That's like the one thing missing from your name. What you mean? It's like when you tell someone don't think of an elephant and they think of an elephant. Like, this is the one thing I told you not to do. Is the FedYoshi I made for you? I'm gonna use it, but I have not imported the game yet. That is way later down the road. That's gonna be like one or two months at least before I get to that. True daily Delphox. Have you gotten beta tested yet? I find that the more you test, the quicker you can improve your game. Like, it's crazy how valuable testers are. But I get that testers are hard to find if you are not already, like, famous. I very much have an advantage in that regard. Hello, marionette. See, what I do right now is I isolate individual levels into a test ROM, and then I send the test ROM to just one person. And use their feedback to improve the game. And I find that's very useful. Well, this is the worst texture imaginable, but it's the UV network. Dang, I thought I was doing something or something. It's horrible. Simon says, don't think of an elephant. Ah, you all lose. That's not a lighthouse. An entire level inside an area? That's just a whole puzzle. The lighthouse has a switch you press to turn the light. And the light shines at a very foggy area. And once you shine the light at the foggy area, you can move through it without being warped out. So the plan is for this to unlock a level. So unless it gets a little blurry, I could paint you a new tiling texture. That would be great, although I will say that what you see right now is definitely not planned to be final. This is awful. But if you were to make a better lighthouse texture, that would be awesome. I actually tried to make a reflective texture, which maybe I can show you real quick what that is supposed to look like. This is actually the sickest effect ever. You're going to be very bothered by this. Wait, it broke? No, I broke it! Oh, I broke it somehow. I don't know how I broke it, but I did. You see the building here? How there's like... There was a blue texture on it, now it's gone. There were like highlights on it, I just broke them somehow. There's blue! That highlight usually moves, and it looks like a reflection. But something broke it, so I can't show you. Yeah, I don't know that yet, Piccolos. The problem is that that would be very time-consuming, and I don't know how much time I'm going to have in the future. I would like to do it. Yeah, I'm trying to have an overworld that feels very connected. So having a puzzle in one part that unlocks something in a different part is just what I want. Programming is in the process of suffering. If you're not suffering, then you're not programming. Maybe it's fun at the beginning, but don't worry, it's all suffering soon enough. Yeah, I'm trying to have a puzzle in one part that unlocks something in a different part. Maybe it's fun at the beginning, but don't worry, it's all suffering soon enough. Yeah, I'm trying to have a puzzle in one part that unlocks something in a different part. Maybe it's fun at the beginning, but don't worry, it's all suffering soon enough. Maybe it's fun at the beginning, but don't worry, it's all suffering soon enough. Yeah, I'm trying to have a puzzle in one part that unlocks something in a different part. Maybe it's fun at the beginning, but don't worry, it's all suffering soon enough. Maybe it's fun at the beginning, but don't worry, it's all suffering soon enough. Yeah, 3D collision is very difficult. So almost every time I fix a bug with the 3D collision, I also introduce one. That just is the way it is. That is absolutely not what it looks like. What? That's just not what my thing looks like. What the fuck is being rendered here? Huh? Why is this happening? Is it in keeping now? But this is not what it looks like! This is nonsense! Let me export it in-game, it's gonna look completely different. Hello, nothing. Oh, it's still not exported. No! It's taking forever. There we go. Let's see what this actually looks like in-game. Well, it definitely looks nothing like that. What the fuck? What's going on? Huh? Ow! Hello, Askel. These are normal vertex color values. This genuinely makes zero sense. What's this linear zone allocation? What do you mean by that? You mean like memory allocation? Where it's like, you have a start pointer, and when you wanna allocate data, you just add that amount of bytes to the start pointer? Because yes, it does that. Well, actually, my own allocator. My allocator does something similar to that. The original one also stores block sizes and how much to deallocate if you wanted to deallocate it. But I simply do not allow deallocation, because that's a useless feature. Okay, now it just works. Now it looks completely different. Okay. This is kind of what I wanted. It's like glassy, but also there is a thing here. But the top of my reference line toss is also just black, so... Fuck it, we'll do that, I guess. Oh no, I like the frame looking intricate. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think that works for the top of the lighthouse. Now for the inside of the lighthouse. Do we really want to do much with it, is the question. I'm thinking the inside of the lighthouse should be simple, just like... One room. Nothing else. One naked, bare-ass room. Yeah, I just didn't set a warp here. Huh. Interesting. Let's do that right now. So this is part six, part seven. And where is it? Part six, underwater cave system. Okay, three is the indicator for start, two is the area indicator. So we need three six over here. Like the Paper Mario thing. Nah. I'm thinking nah. Why did it move? What the hell? That was weird. I need to warp out in this direction again. And we need to warp out in this direction here. Go to area six. Bonjour, unplatincomprehensible. That is a very incomprehensible name. Congratulations. We're not doing all that. I wanna be done with the game at some point. We can't go through that any further, please. You gonna hard mode? Probably not. I don't think hard mode is meaningful in Mario 64. In Mario 64, you kinda make your own difficulty. Hard mode is when you want to play more risky. Yes. Hello Yoshi party. Might have been a while. Hello Rixie. This way works. That way works too. Don't worry about those graphical errors. They don't mean anything. Anyway. Let's think about the inside of the lighthouse. God, I hope Graham makes a new texture for the lighthouse. Look how ugly that looks. Right now. Look. We're gonna put like a lamp here. That's just gonna go in a random direction. And then once you turn it, it's gonna show up. In the correct overworld. That will be a challenge. Where does he go? The reason for that is extremely complicated. I thought it was a fast 64 as well the first time I saw it. But no, that's actually just an engine limitation. Of course, we are going to prevent the player from doing this in the final version. It's just a bug, don't worry about it. Like I said, hopefully Graham makes a new texture, because this one looks awful. Anyway. I don't know if I want to do a whole platforming section for the inside. What if there was just like a control panel and the switch? And you press the switch. Maybe if I want to go a little harder on it. Do we really want there to be more than that? If there's a platforming section, how do we make it interesting? I don't really see a way. Does it need to do that? Isn't it good enough if this just opens the next level? Is it memorable enough if it just opens the next level? Like will you press the button and then forget that it opened the level? Maybe there should be a little challenge just for the player to feel like they have achieved something. Honestly, that might be important. Otherwise the player might forget that they actually just did something. That's my one worry. That's kind of a nice entrance. I think we'll copy something like that. That's kind of a nice entrance. Put Tick Tock Clock inside the lighthouse. Which is the entirety of Tick Tock Clock for no reason. I'm a little worried that we're going to have a repeat of the last impact lighthouse. Which sucked. Because the camera was so tight. We could have a platforming challenge with the camera just locked into the middle. Honestly, that kind of works. That might not be awful. Maybe just one big walljump to the top? Honestly? Yeah. We could actually just have the entire lighthouse themed around walljumps. Let's do that. We don't really have a walljump level. Fuck it. This will be the walljump level. This feels a little dirty, but I kind of have to do that. Ugh. I'm going to do it, but I'm going to feel bad about doing it. Damn, you hate Mario Star Road? I have met Mario Star Road haters before, but... I find that usually when people hate Mario Star Road, it's like rationalized hatred. You know, it's like... They look at the hack and they're like, this should not be good. As in, this is so old, this was made with outdated tools, this is low poly, this is less effort than some of the current hacks. This should not be good. And then that's how they rationalize not liking it. I've met actually a lot of people like that. At least three or four. It's kind of surprising. Or they're like, well, it's Galaxus, kind of a piece of shit, so that's why I should hate this. That also happens. I hate old things, I only like new things. You know me, right? Wait, wait, wait. My opinion on games can be expressed with... How do I... This image here. How is that good? I want Gobbledygoo! That guy is me. That's me. It's good. Well, whether you like it or not, it's very subjective. You think Tears of the Kingdom is overhated? I have never seen anyone hate it, except for me! I hate it. I like Breath of the Wild a lot more. See, there's similar rational hatred. Not rationalized hatred, but rationalized this is better than that. I like Tears of the Kingdom, it's just Breath of the Wild with more stuff. It has to be better. Really? Okay, well, it's not a terrible game. It's just I personally hate it. In large chunks, due to the cosmetics you find in the underground. I think somebody's jumping in. I see only like new things. Is anything not good? The stars are not always that poorly designed. Yeah, I can see a lot of poor design in it. Like, that Mips forest with all the invisible walls, that's kind of bullshit. Mad musical madness, that's pretty much bullshit. The first Bowser level being such a difficulty spike, I remember that's bullshit. But also, there's something special about exploring the castle. Which, I think that's really what makes it feel so good. It evokes the same feeling as Mario 64, with getting deep into the castle and the castle has secrets everywhere. A more open approach to puzzle solving. See, for me, my Tears of the Kingdom experience was that every puzzle had the same solution. So it didn't feel like puzzle solving at all, it just felt like a more sluggish version of platforming to me. There's this one dungeon with, um, fire. Not fire, the one with the minecarts and the volcano. And there's not a single puzzle I did with that, I just platformed my way through it. It just felt like a clunky platform in that sense. Yeah, I mean, that's the best part of World of the Wild 2, right? Being creative. But, in a way, you need limitations to really be creative. And if you just have two or three options that are completely overpowered, then... It kind of takes away the opportunity to be creative. Yeah, I thought a lot of them did. Like, Magnesis and Recall as a combination is just so overpowered that it kind of takes out a lot of the puzzles. I would not have been able to complete the game if I didn't find the early versions because I wouldn't have fun without the battery upgrades. Yeah, not having batteries also. Not having batteries also. Actually, no. You know what? The worst part about it is that your creations just despawn. Like, your Zonai. That was the most fun part of the game, and they didn't let you play with it. It was so expensive to play with it that it's basically never worth it. And then even when you do play with it, it just disappears. That's a tragedy. Do you remember, Ibarra? I do. Okay, you know what else? This is a very minor thing, but the fact that it's so bad. The selling. Like, selling items in Tears of the Kingdom for rupees. Why do I have to sell everything one by one? Hmm. Is there anything in the environments where there's less tension and it's more like niche survival tools? Hmm. Some of them. I mean, the bomb. The two types of bombs definitely makes one of the two bombs niche. But Magnesis definitely felt very useful. The freezing. The freezing is... Honestly, I like the freezing as an ability. It's so innocent and it can combo with stuff. It's good. I think maybe this is a good guideline, where it's like, if you give players utility, make sure that each individual piece of utility is really weak. Because if you make it strong, then it's just very easy to break everything. Hello, Sol is too cool. He's only gets you some designated level items though, like when there's an Ultra Hand as a physics tool. Yeah, but that made Ultra Hand way too good, right? I mean, that's why you have the recall Ultra Hand thing, where it's just, you can do whatever. I assume that's why they made it only work on designated level items. Because they knew, like, okay, this is actually way too much. If you can use it on everything. I don't know. Tell us how 3D Mario is. It's not a fair challenge. The game is difficult because it's poorly made. Ooh, okay. I mean, it's definitely a lot more difficult than any official game. What is this song? Final Fantasy XIII soundtrack. I don't know. I don't know what the concept of this song is. Star Route for many people, I think, is still, like, the only hack that feels like Mario 64. So the consensus of it is very good. But that's the consensus in, like, the public's eye, I think. The consensus in the community's eye is the thing I mentioned where it's like, oh, this is old and doesn't have all the quality of life upgrades, therefore it's bad. But I disagree with that thinking, too. The thing I don't agree with as far as others are concerned, you have to find a treasure map, you have to unlock the ice cap, you have to go on the other side of the world, and the player needs to complete the lighthouse. I don't know. Hmm. Hmm. That's a thinker. Um, hmm. You have to unlock the ice cap. Hmm. Yeah, you kinda do have to unlock the ice cap for all this. The lighthouse definitely should be easy to complete. You also kinda get the cloud cap this way. Maybe we just need to make really sure that the ice cap's easy to unlock? Hmm. Well, my game diverges a lot more from Mario 64's formula than Star Road's. Um, I do think it's in a more enjoyable way, but, you know, if you're in this for like, I like Mario 64 and I want more Mario 64, then Star Road is maybe more well-suited? Hmm. Yeah, we need to make it really obvious how to find the ice cap. You're right, tea time. Mario 64 code and essence left. Well, there's a little bit of Mario 64 code left. Just today I ripped out another piece of it. Um, I do plan before release to go over everything and make sure that, you know, stuff like this just goes. Because that's just a remnant of Mario 64 that no one needs. Um, and eventually we'll be at 0% Mario 64 code. So that will be nice. And like, refactor code to actually fit with my code guidelines. Hmm. We will do stuff like that. That's the nice part about working alone on a project. You can just make refactors and no one cares. Um, definitely as a patch, Akiren, just to be safe. Yes, they need Darfox. And that also is the reason why I need 0% original code. To make my own game I have to replace Mario even with my own character. Fortunately, programming a player character is very easy. The only difficult part about it is like programming the collision. And I've already done that. So I don't think that making my own player character would take very long. Apart from animations. All the animation work is going to be a lot. But I have help. Do you have a character design? We have been workshopping a little bit for quite a while now. But it's not finalized yet. Not 100% on it. It's like, I think we have something decent. But it's missing the special something. Yeah, I mean, I agree. You know, that reminds me of something. How is that game called? Renegade or something? N64 style? Relegate? I'm just gonna go with N64 style for the game. Pseudo-regalia. This has that effect where it's like, people see the main character. And they're very attracted to the main character. And the game itself looks very pokey. But because they like the main character, that game is very popular. How do you and the team go about making textures look N64-esque? Biobank often makes a 3D model and pre-renders it into a texture. A lot of them are also from Minecraft texture packs. Mario's gonna stay in Return to Yoshi's Islands. There might be a separate game with my own custom character. Sybil has realistic design. To be honest, I was looking at that and I was thinking like, okay, the fact that people are attracted to this is the main reason people like this game. But maybe that says more about me than about the people. How do you and the team go about making textures look N64-esque? I think we killed Pirate7. So we're gonna make this the lighthouse. Hello Benjamin. There's a good chance that he will be playable. I haven't played it, so I wouldn't know. I just thought it looked kinda poopy. And then also, I've watched someone play this for 5 minutes. So that's my entire impression. But I saw it advertised as an N64-style game. But then it has per-pixel lighting. And it looked like the N64 style was just an excuse to not put much work into the visuals. Because it wasn't really N64-style, what I saw. Hello XBM. The movement is really good. Okay, that's good. So maybe that's also a big contributor to why people like the game. I don't know. And also, I think it's pretty strange because it's made in only a few months. And it goes to a shelf where you can make a game if you purchase the parts that matter. True, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What am I doing after RTY is finished? I don't know. Make YouTube videos. Collect money. And chill with my family. Maybe make more games. So that's finally getting fixed. Graham said he might make a texture. So if he makes a texture, it's finally getting fixed. But you know what? You know what? Just for everyone's eyeballs' sake, I am going to fix it right now. It's fixed. It needs to be rewritten by default. For what? Yeah, exactly, Konzo. And I get it. I mean, making like the AAA art style is so time-consuming that it would be impossible for an indie dev to make a game at all. You have 7 ads? You're getting scammed by Twitch. Maybe you should just subscribe to the channel so you don't get any ads. Okay. Okay, that's a big one. Okay, that's fair. It's definitely a lot easier to work in my audio code. If you look at mine. Red for sound. The whole thing is just 3,000 lines. Compared to vanilla where it's like... Actually, this is not even 3,000 lines. Like 500 of those is dialogue. More like 2,000 lines. Dialogue and tables. It's a lot easier to work with for sure. Sorry. Sorry. I like the harmonica. The developers are next. No one is safe. No one is safe. Thanks for the money, Powerboys. 2025 edition. I don't know, Darkwings. The thing is, even if I was not making a game anymore, my YouTube channel is so profitable right now with all the sponsors, that I would be making videos for Eternity's Curse to come. Until it's dead. They're gonna kill that channel. Please don't. Bro, we're gonna turn into fucking Veritasium. Clickbait bullshit. Are they still so bad? Let me see. Yeah, I'm sure that's real. God, I hate this channel. I used to like it. I only hate it because I used to love it. See, you can't really hate something without the first having been love, you know? Yeah. See, one project I really want to make is... So maybe you remember, the first Mario 64 game I ever made, Mario 64 Madness, was made in two weeks and had 123 stars. I think it would be cool to make another project like that, but have it run on N64. If it runs on N64, I hate it. I hate it, but I don't care about it. Maybe I should make this one for sure. I don't think I have another one of this size in me. I released my dick with an A-powered Mecha Penis and this is what happened? And the thumb says, it's doing it by itself. Yeah, except I have to bring the N64 into it somehow. Yes, Dark Wheeze. No, Tad, I'm not doing that. But if you're lucky, we could get the static recompilation, which is basically everything you described without any of the stupid bullshit of what you described. Why not make your own emulator? I mean, what we could do is we could take Luna's Project 64 and bundle my ROM with it and then you would just have to double click Luna's Project 64 and it would be set up and ready to go for you with the correct settings hardcoded into it. I think that would be fine. But yeah, I'm definitely not. Making an emulator from the ground up. No it isn't. Making a ranger is easy. I do it all the time. So Lunar's Project 64 is kind of just that emulator but updated. So that you know the security issue is gone and like some other things are easier or better. The idea is that this way no one needs to update to an emulator they don't like. Obviously it's still based on like Project 64 I think. So it has many of the same issues. Didn't you work at- I still work at Gears for Breakfast. I think the N64 is just hard to emulate because of it's weird architecture. See the Gamecube, at the time the Gamecube happened, hardware was actually strong enough to do 3D games. When the N64 happened, clearly it wasn't. They had to make like a ton of nonsense, not nonsense but like a ton of hacks to get the console to run at all. Is that a good thing guys? Run at a higher framerate or is everything just interpolated? It's just interpolated. Which makes it a higher framerate. But the way it's interpolated is different than what you might think. Like it's not the stupid movie AI interpolation bullshit or anything like that. They actually interpolate the rendering matrices. So what you get is pretty realistically close to what you would get with a higher framerate if the game was programmed for it. The thing is you can't just put that framerate of a game higher. Let's take Mario Kart for example. Let's say the game runs at 30fps normally, I don't know what it runs at, but let's say you make it run at 60fps. Now if you run all the same code, obviously the game is twice as fast. If you run all the same code but like half the velocity in the end, you still don't get the same result because acceleration curves are going to be different. The acceleration is going to happen at twice the rate. So the integral is going to be larger. And there's issues like that everywhere. So no matter what you do, you cannot get games run at a higher framerate just by doing the thing that applies to every game. You have to edit every single game individually. Well my name is stillBienecredits for the final thing. I believe I put you in. Let me check. You are, shoutouts to all contributors, xpm-textures. You are in here. There's a dog on the beach, can my name go in the credits as dog conceptualization? There has to be a minimum threshold to where a contributor ends. Because otherwise you're going to have people that gave me advice in high school to be like always be true to yourself or some shit like that. Then you have to be like, wow, this guy inspired me. So the line is, if you have made an asset or anything that actually makes it into the game, then I put your name into the credits. Do we need any new textures? Probably. That's like the entire intro. Oh, no, that's not the intro anymore. I think you missed it. We have a different intro. Biomake made a cinematic for this. Have you seen Biomech's cinematic for the intro? It is so good. Let me find it. It's the storyboard. Mario and Chilling in their house. And then... Knock, knock, knock. Hello! Here's a letter. Mario, Dinosaurland is in danger. Let me tell you how it happened. It was a beautiful day on Yoshi's Island. The Super Happy Tree had blessed us with a big gift. Unfortunately, it was a trap. All the Yoshis on the island were captured at the same time. Well, all the Yoshis except me. I was busy working somewhere. I was about to fly away with all my friends. Everyone is gone. I can't do anything. So, Mario, please help us. Return to Yoshi's Island. Cinema. The story seems kind of dark. I was thinking that too. But I'm not really sure how we can make that any better. We need Bozo to be a ruthless capitalist. That's important to me. Is there a reason for Bozo to capture the Yoshis? Yes, he puts them to work in his factories. Mario games never had dark stories. Super Galaxy Island does. But won't they die? No, they don't die. Bozo is just making them work and build his ships and stuff. They don't die. They just get enslaved, basically. Yoshi's Island Yoshi's Island Yoshi's Special Level I mean, there is a level where Yoshi's working and they're for sure sweating. Yoshi's Island Prega B? Prega B, I see. As in a priority of Prega U, Prega University. That's how I'm understanding it. Is it even legal for them to call themselves a university? It feels like it should be illegal. Because they're just not, right? Yoshi's Island Bozo in a mine course? No, Bozo is not in a mine course. Return Yoshi's slave master? What? Bozo's a little ruthless in this game. What can I say? He's out for profit. Yoshi's Island Yoshi's Island Prega U is federally funded? That is so funny. So what if the way this level works is the camera was just statically in the middle here? And you had to climb around the outside doing wallkicks and stuff to get to the top. Do you think that would be fun? I think it would be. Say that again? No. ETC type deal? I guess kinda. I get to D level? Well, not quite to D, but almost. Let's see what fun platforming we can put in here. Let's start it this way, so that no matter which way you go, you're gonna have a good start. Why would we have random generated obstacles? We're not Pikmin 2. We're not making the same mistake as Pikmin 2. I have not made a Minecraft reference. If you had a Minecraft reference in what I said, then that is your own personal brain rot. What is this 6-7 thing? I said 6-7 in my last video, and people were like, Kaze is saying brain rot. And I'm like, what the fuck? What is 6-7? How is it brain rot? I can't even fucking say numbers anymore. Yeah, don't worry. It won't be too banishing. You're gonna be mostly going around the outside, and there's going to be a safe ground like every couple meters. People hate the game score? Huh? Is it basically the same as mid? Oh, because like a 6-7 rating is mid? Is that the idea? It's just the number that people say? I'm getting mixed signals here. 6-7-S chap. Did I use it right? I have not decided on the T-time. It feels wrong to have a final level, a real final level, a real, real final level, you know? I don't know. See, you're joking, but I actually was thinking that the final level in 64-land was too easy, and I wanted it to be more difficult. And people were like, no, that level is too difficult. So I don't know what to believe anymore. I don't know. To run like difficulty syndrome? That's true. But for the final level? I mean, come on. Just the final level? As a treat? And would be like a challenge that the average player spends 10 hours on? That's how you generate memories, you know? Yeah? It's kind of a nice section. Is it? Oh, no. What happened? What happened? Yeah, that sounds cool there, Fox. We can probably do something like that. It was not the camera setup. What was it? What did we change? Nothing, right? What did I change to break it? Maybe if we used a better emulator? Hello, Xena. Infinite loop? How come? That's the idle thread! I did not. Look at this, Xena made this crib. For course 9. This is going to lead to the wingtub level. I changed the UVs of this lighting because it looked weird before. Well, I made it weirder somehow. Here's the crib, right? Little did you know it was Evil Baby. What's the crib for? It's for a baby Yoshi. Well, no one's actually inside here, but this is like a warp. You go there and Mario jumps into it. Okay, so... Something here seems to crash and I'm not sure what it is. That would certainly do it. What? Huh? It would pregnant women on baby blankets? Well, it would be closer to putting toddlers on the baby blankets. And is that really so weird? Like, baby blankets have Pokemon on them? Oh, I exported the wrong level. That's why. I want to make clean. I'm just going to make clean and then it's going to work. That bug was not real, I just exported the wrong level. Rewrite on the rust? True, that will fix everything. Why didn't I think of that? You must be a genius. There we go. Okay. Wow, this feels like an optical illusion. Maybe if I make the whole thing a little smaller, it will feel a little better. Yeah, I think we gotta make the whole thing a little smaller. There is a good chance it will support many languages, yes. Obviously, I am not going to make all the languages. But I probably will make a German version. And I think Biobank wants to make a French version. And Rionna wants to make a Spanish one. So that's a couple languages covered. Well, I said I was going to make it smaller. Did I not? Hello Polaris. Did I not mean the whole lighthouse? I did mean the whole lighthouse. I already shrunk the whole lighthouse. It's already done! I'm two steps ahead of you. Thank you. I'm trying to do my own C++ 3D rendering or Qt animation. I'm sure my videos will help a lot if you watch the one on render matrices, for example. This is a good intro to the subject. You know what they say, the more the merrier. I already said the more the better, but I agree. I don't want this to be too difficult, so I'm just going to do that. Hello Xeraclum. Let's have the player go around here. I don't think that works. And then here we can do another small walking section. Are we still in the overworld? Yeah, the overworld is gigantic. So we're going to be in the overworld for a while. We are almost done with part 3 out of 15 in the overworld, so this is quite the project. What is that? What is an open world pit for? I'm going to make the lava go up. No! There was this one Final Fantasy song that drove me fucking insane every time I heard it. Oh yeah. Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon. You know that song? I hope that doesn't play. I am going to lose it if it plays. One game, Chocobo's Dungeons. Something about bangers? So the Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon is not in the game? You know when you just play the fucking whole keyboard from left to right and then from right to left. Oh, fuck. 4248. What the fuck am I saying? 4248. Okay, I'm right. I don't know what that was. I had a little bit of a stroke. Yes, I think we should have some windows to put light into here and make this look nice. This is a bit hard to see, but if you use windows in the correct places, I think that's fine. This jump is a little too difficult. Is this jump fine? I'm not sure. I think I have to move this down a little bit. Yeah, I like the camera. This seems like a worthwhile section to the player. Nope, they're not facing inwards at all. That's a bit of an optical illusion. There's a little bit of a built-in shortcut here, if you're brave enough. Makes me feel claustrophobic. What? I think I'm going to move far away, maybe? This feels very close to Mario. We could try to move it onto the other side, but I think the camera moving around like that would feel very bad. We don't have a texture yet. How can I change the texture when there is none yet? Oh, it's a lighthouse. How do I make this jump less difficult? Do we just connect that? I could just connect that. I think I might just have to connect that. We could connect only one side, but that's a little bit evil. You know what we could also do? We could just remove one side of this whole thing, so there's only one way to get up. But I think I like the symmetry. And then I wanted a window in here. I could align the windows with those quartz here. I think that could look good. The windows themselves are not aligned in the middle. There we go. Like so. The thing still rotates around the center, but I think it's worth a try. No, I don't want to just slide the camera around here. I'd have to add that functionality to the engine, and I don't think it's going to be good. Let's slide the camera like that. Let's just do it. Still works. Nothing wrong with a bit of camera trolling, making the player stay worse. Nothing wrong with, you know, just torturing your player. Developers need to have fun, too. They're also humans. Oh, this is a very unfitting window. Hello, Rex Rath. Could you give me a list of homies, so I know that I'm on the list? So I can appropriately respond to your question. Inquiry. Prompt. Okay, these all look terrible. Balan Wonderworld. Dude, I played like one level of Balan Wonderworld with Zayna. It was bad. Oh my god, you are the unusual brought back memories of that one. You guys, if you've played, I think Donkey Kong 64, you know what I'm talking about. You get one long wooden log that's like at the top of a room with like a little platforming section to it, where you are Diddy Kong and you have to walk past the log. Do you know what I mean? I think you know exactly what I mean if you know Donkey Kong 64. Which world? I think it's Aztec Land or something. You know what I'm talking about. I am glad. Okay. Okay. Okay. I remember I played the game. I got to the point where there's the clown box that jumps from platform to platform. And I got so annoyed at having to wait for the vulnerable phase and I just stopped playing. Damn, if even the person that 100%ed it multiple times rages at it, I think I was very justified. Stop being so negative? No. Okay, fine. I'll say something nice about Donkey Kong 64. It's got a banger vibe. The intro is very cool. The intro is like peak video games. I don't know. I never played much banjo. I don't know. I should have played banjo. I think I would have fun with it. I just never did. Okay. I'm just leaving this as a note for myself. I like this kind of light. Just take another look, see if it feels fine. I'm not doing that. Well, Donkey Kong 64 has a lot of cultural significance still today, right? The charm of the game is clearly what makes sense, not so much the gameplay. It's kind of interesting that the charm of the game is what people remember and not really the moment-to-moment gameplay. It feels like games nowadays have the opposite thing going on, where they care more about moment-to-moment gameplay than overall charm. Seems to be what Volunteers Against Nonsense is saying. While I don't have the tactical power of a Nintendo Switch, I think this is a little bit of an unfair comparison. You know what we actually do have over Nintendo Switch games though? Our animations of background characters don't go into low FPS mode. Alright, I think doing it this way, with just one big switch at the top, that will start a cutscene after the top of the light is turning. So that's the only thing we have to do. We have to put a big thing here, with a light. And then, once you press the switch, this level here loads, the whole light turns, and World 5 opens up. That's good. I would say before we do that, we should work on the ice cap. It doesn't have textures yet in XPM, so don't worry about that. What if the camera looks up at the ceiling of the room? Then you can't see Mario. I would say that's a problem. Anyway, so the plan was, once you have collected enough stars, there would be a treasure map you can find somehow. The treasure map would have instructions like, go here, do three backflips, and you'll find the ice cap level or something. Does that make it stargated? Well, my initial plan was that it would randomly appear at some point. But considering how important it is that you find the ice cap immediately, I was thinking there would just be a message in a bottle here immediately. Like, there would be a message in a bottle thing, it would sparkle, so you'd be very inclined to collect it. And once you collect it, it gives you instructions on how to find the ice cap level. I think that is the correct way of doing it. And we also need to add to the overworld that if you've beaten Wario in this level here, he sells you a star for 1000 coins. Are there any? There's some places that are stargated, like the first boza level, and the second boza level, and the third boza level, but that's about it. Oh yeah, uh, Wario's sale thing? I think I'll have Zayna make the model for that, where Wario sells you a star. Um, message in the bottle. We need to think of a puzzle for the message in the bottle, too. Let me think about it, what would it look like? It should reference things that actually just exist in the world. Something like, stand at the palm, and face the entrance to the spooky cave, and then turn around, and do 5 backflips, and then do a ground pound. Something like that is what we want. I'm just thinking, is there a good way of doing it? We could put a special landmark here. Like a landmark, just for the thing. Something in the middle of here would be very good. Something that is here naturally. Maybe something that even is kind of shaped like an X. Wow, that was not good. What are natural formations that a pirate would remember? Um, let's see. Nature highlights. We're not doing that Zelda. Why is it hair? What is this? A pond? Okay. It's all just fucking mountains. Nature spots. Nature landmarks. That's what we're looking for, we're looking for landmarks. Natural landmarks. Unless we're going to have a float animation, kind of bobbing up and down in the water. Um, no, they're kind of touching the floor. That's why they won't. They're on the floor. How come humans have evolved in a way where we think our mountains are cool? Makes no sense. A bridge is cool. This is not real, right? That's pretty cool. Mountains fear predators, but there's also no food. Actually, aren't there mountain lions on mountains? I guess we can eat those. Hello, AP. Katze, you're calling me Katze? I'm assuming that's how to correct. Going pretty well. Look at this, this guy won't let us in. What an asshole. Okay, I'm thinking for a natural landmark, we could put maybe a little rock formation here. And then the treasure map could be like, step on the rock formation and look at the volcano. Eh, it's going to be hard to figure out which volcano I mean. Hehe. Oh yeah, you have to trick Wario. Well, you can crawl through there, or you can, you know, do that. But the intended way is to crawl through here. Oh, you mean like the Yoshi's Island penicills? We should be adding those, yes. Understandable, AP. Maybe a little lake, like a puddle? I feel like if we want to have a permanent marking, a piece of rock makes the most sense. You know, like Stonehenge, but Yoshi's? Yoshihenge? What does Stonehenge look like? Yeah, like a Yoshi way of Stonehenge. Surely they would do something cool with it. I haven't shown this in like an hour, I think you're way behind Graham. Why is this wing a pentagon? I feel like Hexen is worth the extra tries. No. It's so small. We're not adding random quicksand here. No, I think a rock formation, but then I'm thinking of how the input should work. If we add those hills from Yoshi's Island... Let me see those. We could have the player target one of those. You know these cells? We could have some of these cells in the background. So, if we had like one rock you stand on, and then there's the hills in the background here, and then we tell the player stand on the rock, face the hill, and then do three backflips, and then do a groundbound. It is Final Fantasy! We're listening to Final Fantasy XIII. A basalt column? Let me look at what that looks like. What the hell? That's real? That's crazy. This is actually just hexagons. Okay, how about we see if we can pull off a good version of these cells first, and then we put like three hills here. And then we tell the player face that hill, do five backflips, and do a groundbound. Not every player knows how to do a backflip. Then what else is it gonna be? That would be cute, Graham. That is a detail for maybe later. For now, we want to get the main gameplay done. Three steps forward? And what is a step? Think about it, what is a step? Can you give me an answer to something that is a step and is unambiguous? I don't think you can. We could even give a backflip tutorial in the treasure map. How about that? A punch is consistent, a jump kick is not. Honestly, giving the breakdance a use wouldn't even be so bad. I think people would love it if that move actually ever did anything. Honestly, this is only 60 triangles. We can easily add a bunch of these here. Yep, I think I like these cells. Now, how do we make the model for these? The ones from the overworlds in the first demo looked horrible. I'm not using those. What sphere? Oh, I see. I mean, is it really so different from what I'm doing here? I guess I can see the argument for something like this. Yeah, that's a lot rounder at little cost. What's with the lighting here? There we go. I doubt it's more efficient than this. This should be max efficiency. I mean, if you can prove me wrong, that would be pretty awesome. The Ocean's Island water color level? No, we're not changing the anti-abyssal style just for one level. I think I'll need Zayna to make a texture for this. Yes, Biobank is working on the ice cap. Right on the bottom? No, it's just like that on purpose. That's kind of what they look like. You'll see, I think. I hope. If you don't see it, then I can still change it. How do you even make this texture? I'm just making one. There's one retro section in every level. That's the current rule. It's very telegraphed. Stop! It comes before Mario Sunshine chronically. Stop. Their face is wider. Yeah, that's not quite right. They do look shrewdly drawn, but not this horrific. I hate this. I wish I could still use Photoshop. Okay, I think this kind of works. How do you invert colors in GIMP? There has to be a hotkey. Looks like they're wide in the middle, though. Yeah, don't worry, we'll solve that with UV mapping. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ The noise input is pretty bad. We do not want the noise input. Lesson learned. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ That looks so ass. You could paint the- Yeah, that would be awesome. Then I don't have to do this. This is the reference. I want all three of those and the three colors. I mean, ideally this would work via vertex colors, but honestly I don't know how to do this. Oh, you have a quad sphere? Let me take a look at that. You sent me a quad sphere. ♪♪ Well, art sets are hard to make, especially when I'm not a texture artist at all. Really, I'm just hoping to get something that is good enough that Biobank understands my idea. But if Graham can do it right, right away, that's even better. ♪♪ You can model them, Graham. It's fine either way. I suspect you prefer to model them yourself. Although keep in mind mine are only 45 triangles. So that is a good triangle guideline. ♪♪ ♪♪ Hmm. I'm guessing you meant like this for the top. I don't know. Oh, that's kind of crazy how this looks. It's better than I thought it would. How does it compare to like an icosphere? Multivisual icosphere. ♪♪ It looks more like a one-division icosphere and it's normally more than two-divisions, so that makes sense. We can afford the 15 triangles. I'm actually more worried that we're going to run out of memory in this area here at some point. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Honestly, with a proper second texture this wouldn't even look horrible. If only I had something... Wow. Terrible. Is there something around the whole island or just that part? Possibly around everything. I'm not sure yet. I'll just leave it like this for now, since Graham will just make something better anyway. And then right here we want some sort of rock formation. And then the hint can just be like look at that, do five backflips, do a ground pound. Well, actually I want the thing to be here, so maybe look at that, turn around, do five backflips. It would be nice if we had some sort of visual hint here too, something that marks the spot really. Shine blue piglets, kinda. Yeah, just break dance five times, that will get you from A to B. 30 minutes. Alright, that's pretty good. I don't know how long it will take me to make a decent version of this. Alright, here we go. This is part of Fast64, which is a plugin I use and not something I made. It is community made. Like the Mars64 community made this together. We're actually so lucky that the Zelda hackers started working with the decomp because the Zelda hackers always had much better rawmaking tools and now that they also work with the decomp we get to profit off of that. I don't know what it is, man. Something about Zelda hackers just makes it so that they're way more talented than the Mars64 people. On average of course, we're talking averages. I don't know. There are many things I could do and even more that I don't want to do. At least the island forms are ones of those that I do not want to do. It's such a random idea. The problem is, there are many, many random ideas and we can't add them all to the game. At this point, I think we have inflated the scope enough. We are done creepscoping. Scope-creeping. So now it's all just finishing the plans we already have. I will probably do a playthrough of it on my main channel. Mario 64 for inflation? That's already a Mario 64 in the ass. Nintendo gave this to you. I don't know. Probably should have UV-mapped this first. But oh well. I guess they're different enough. That's fine. Do you have your own eye texture from Lyrie? No, I don't. I have no eye texture. When you just saw me try to draw it and my attempt was pathetic. Nice, nice. That's good. I think this will give us the best results. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, I definitely don't want that. Whoa, what's this door? What's this? What's this? I don't know. Can I make a triangle on this texture? I don't know. That's kind of not horrible. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think that is decent. This will be our stone formation here. I don't know. And then this part here. Easy. Easy. They kind of look like wood. Maybe that's the color? I don't even see the wood. I don't know. No, it's kind of ambient occlusion. It's kind of always like that. I don't know the physical reason behind it. But it usually looks a lot better when you do it. Yeah, now we can be like... If the hint there is like... Stand on the rock transformation. Look at the thing. Turn around and do 7 backflips. And then it's here. That's perfect. Plus the rocks kind of break out the complete emptiness of this a bit. I'm using Luna's Project 64. Vabsia moment. It is a Vabsia moment. That's basically the same idea. Yep, next we need to make the message in the bottle. But for now, I believe I am done. And I will be cancelling the stream now. Bye bye. We're done here. Bye bye.
