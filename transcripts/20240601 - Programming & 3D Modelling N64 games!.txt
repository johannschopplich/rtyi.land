I mean, see if I can somehow make this work. No one here. Oh, hello Yoshi name case. Great. I can't log into restream. That's awesome. Hello Molly. Hello Zaina. Hello Lila. Oh my god. You're now a mod. I just saw it for the first time. I can't see the YouTube chat either. Or maybe just no one's typing in there. That's also possible. Let me just figure out my chat situation here real quick. Isn't there like a pop-up chat on Twitch? How do I do this? How do you pop-up chat on Twitch? Wait. Is my microphone muted, guys? Was my microphone muted? Hello, are we here now? God damn it. Basically, I was saying we have a restream situation once again, and I cannot see my chat. Hello Lila. I just saw for the first time that you are a mod on here. I couldn't tell before because I was on restream chat, but now restream doesn't work anymore. Everything's frozen. Cool, cool, cool. Hello, you guys in the YouTube chat. The YouTube is not working for me. Awesome, awesome. Hello, Biobank. Let me just figure out how I can look at my livestream. There we go. Oh, I can now see the YouTube chat. Cool, cool. Okay, so I found a program I usually hate the most. JavaScript and Node.js. I don't know what that is. Guys, how do you pop-up the Twitch chat? Everything is frozen because of IceCastle. True. I was playing with materials a little bit more after talking to Dan. I could get something like this to kind of work. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the thing that he was trying to get to work. The thing he did looked a lot better than what I have here, I think, which is unfortunate. Pop-up chat, I found the button. I have the chat popped out, and now I can also look at the YouTube chat. Hello, XPM. Oh, this is cool. Now I can see both chats. All right, this will have to work. I'm giving up on restream. Hello, Valze. So, trying to make the light shine different layers of the textures, similar to ice. Yeah, so, I mean, if you look at the walls right here, you can see how the shine moves already. But it didn't look as icy as I want them to be. Same Leela. Nice slide hack. Glad you like it. So, I was making a lot of content recently. For this, I was thinking this was going to be like one way to get around. I was thinking this level should have a lot of these slide jumps because I really like them. Although I do need a way to safely get back here. So, we're going to add that, hopefully. What a nice castle to rule. Way to lead for the Royal Skyrim game. What's that, Eiza? And just allow them to use your engine. That was just a collaboration, honestly. I did all the programming and I helped them with a bunch of shaders. And, of course, I had complete authority over my slides. So, I guess I was more in charge. But Eiza did most of his own stuff himself. There's also this part here. See, what I did here is... It's kind of hard to realize you can go there. But you can do this to reveal more of the secret path. And then here you go down like that. Which the camera here still sucks. But I'm going to fix that. I think that's kind of neat. And then let me show you what we have on the other side of the castle. The cats seem to be very expressive. Yeah, I think they're kind of cute. This is also kind of cute. So, here we got a bunch of different platforming stuff. Where you can just go wherever you want. I like this part here. The bridges are very cool, too. So, this is going to be a very platformy level, I think. Those are usually a little bit quicker to make. Then over here, I kind of improved this section a little bit. So that there's like a proper space here. Where you can then roll the snowball down into the wall here. It's less sub-area-ish than last time. Well, because it's bigger now. I'm glad you like Peach's Fury. We did put... Or I did put a lot of work into the controls there. You can also do cool skips like this. Which I kind of like. There's the bug with the sideflip there. Don't worry about that. Difficulty probably around vanilla Mario 64. Some of this may look more difficult. But the controls in this game are a lot more consistent. So, that hopefully makes up for the difficulty. We must combine it as multi-texture plus shade color. Plus prim color over shade alpha. Okay. Not 100% sure what this means yet. But sounds good. But yeah, I made a lot of this castle to be like about sliding. And like slight momentum jumps. So, right here you can just climb this by doing the slight momentum jumps. Which I guess could be kind of neat. And then over here, this would be up to the boss. And right here we're gonna have like ice walls on the sides. With like enemies frozen behind it. Okay. Hello Retroboy. Dang. Twitch is scamming you for more money. I kind of don't like that this is such a leap of faith. If you want to get anywhere. Maybe we should not have this. Or maybe if we move this further down. So, instead of leap of faithing you would like instantly end up here. And do this jump. You can see how the castle makes a loop. Where the black spots are supposed to be. They're just not existing right now. The AI voice. That was a voice before AI was a thing. Let's just text to speech. Summerland vibes are back. Yep, yep. Playtest this. We are not doing any playtesting for a long time. Generic male TTS voice. No, it's Justin. I thermal paste. I am so confused. Yeah, basically. Our task for the day is to make the platforming good. And then after we made the platforming good. We can make the visuals good. And this is kind of like what we want the visuals to look like. This was our test for this. Yeah, it's 10 bits minimum. It's stupid enough to be like, oh my God. They have artificial intelligence in that. See a ether. Let's see. What's the ratio here? 4250 divided by 2000. It's okay. So. 941. So we'd have to move to the 941 units down. To keep the same RAM. That would lead us to exit here, which is also not good. Hello, Mushi. Post them. Ask a stupid question. What is a good way not to write in C? A good way not to write in C. I guess that would be writing an assembly. Assembly is a good way to not write in C. Do you still use Sketchup sometimes? No. There's no use case for it for me. Right. And we need a way to get back from here to the main area. So those are the two things we want to do. I think just having a walk section here would be completely fine. The problem is. We're running out of level.  I think we're out of level. No, I just mean like physical space. There is no more physical space here. So I have to move this down a little bit. I mean, that's what we're doing early sketching for to make sure everything works as we want. Right, so this is 300 extra coordinates now, which is nice, nice. And it still looks fine to me. Why did you make some areas before in the outside area? This is the main area. Imagine wall kicks with an ice wall and mirror Mario on each side. Oh, that would be look so cool. I want a section for that now. That's that's just such a cool idea. Wait, a mirror Mario on each side. So you have something like this and then there's a mirror Mario here and a mirror Mario here. But if you did that, wouldn't you end up with like a hall of mirrors like. Like this. I don't want to render that many Mario's. I did not leave. That sounds cool. Yeah. What if just one side was mirrored and the other wasn't? Hall of mirrors is still doable. Yeah, but I'm on an N64. Do you really want that? Yeah, Leo, I do that. Like that scene in John Wick. Oh yeah, John Wick. Of course, everyone knows John Wick. How can I forget that beloved movie? Can I send a video on that meme review? Sure. We cut all these appearing platforms to be visible in a mirror. True. All right. Let's see what Lila has sent me. Let's get banned. Big balls. What's that in the video? No, better said that. That was too well timed. I see. That takes a long time to recognize for how few pixels that is. Are you sure this is viable? What's this neural network going to do? That's a lot slower than I thought it would be. It is cool. Yeah, I 100% agree. It's cool. Dude, if you say this is cool, you're going to get canceled on Twitter. They hate AI over there. Legit, I'm at a point where I won't say that anything AI is going to look cool publicly. Because I think that I will literally be murdered on twitter.com. You know what? No, I'm not making any more jokes about that. No, no, they just hate AI. That's shit. No, Nova, don't do it. Yes, that was a neural network running on the N64. Okay, how do we best lay out these walls so that we can make the mirror happen? Ethical, useful AI. What about an AI that does your taxes for you? And it's trained by actually looking at people's taxes. And if Degree Project is about designing an AI machine learning to break positions of solar stains. Yeah, you're going to get murdered. I have no idea what that is right now, boy. Same pens, but do you trust the average person to do it better? Not sure. Yeah. I think that's the big thing. Like, it doesn't need to be good. It just needs to be better than the average person. I think that's true for a lot of technologies.  Don't like the nest. Nope. Yeah. So I know this all looks spooky right now, but it's all just a platforming we're planning right now. So don't worry. Do not cry, my children. What's going on here? So this is going to be the mirror here, this wall. And then you're going to walk kick off the mirror here between the wall. So you're just going to keep picking the mirror, Mario, and it's going to look really cool. I just like my own backside. And I'm like, let's just put that in the game. It's about. Does Snow think Yoshi is on his level? I don't think so. Oh yeah guys. I had a crazy experience yesterday and there's one thing I need from you guys. I need you guys to send me a picture and I want you to be genuine about this. Send me a picture of chicken filet. I'm serious. 100% send me a picture of what you think chicken filet is. From Google or from home, either one is fine. I just need to know what you guys think chicken filet is. Do you have some enemies planned for this level? Yes, yes. I actually have a lot of enemies planned. Chicken filet. Okay. He believes this is chicken filet. What else? Is zombie Mario out of snow? Another chicken filet. Thank you very much. Note how this chicken filet is kind of different from this chicken filet. Chicken filet. Let's see. Okay. Chicken filet. Interesting. This is also very different from this one. This kind of... Okay. This one here looks like an uncooked version of this, but it looks very, very different from this one here. Thank you for the input. Another picture of chicken filet. Okay. Interesting. You think that's chicken filet? Sorry, I can't read all that Retroboy. I just want to make my level. No. And no one chicken filet. This is what you believe chicken filet is? I feel like you have not taken the assignment serious. Yeah, I feel like we don't have a conclusive opinion on what chicken filet is. Yes. Basically, our eternary programming language that's hard to write for clown. Oh, I see. I don't know. I don't like making a programming language just for the difficult. If you want the difficult, go lift weights. Go learn an art. Programming is something you do to build something. The act of it itself should be as simple as possible. Raw chicken filet. Okay. Okay. All right. So we've got a bunch of opinions on chicken filet so far. Is there anyone else want to give their opinion on chicken filet before the big reveal? Okay. So I was at a restaurant yesterday and I ordered the chicken filet with some fries. I thought I was going to get like a proper meal, you know, some chicken breast, like slightly grilled, maybe some fries on the side, like a sauce on top. What I got, let me find an image that looks disgusting enough. I got something kind of like this with like a sauce and plastic buckets. And these tasted like plastic and like cardboard, actually, they were literally like just deep frozen chicken tendies that they just warmed up again. It was awful. And I was so sad. You got tendies? Yes, exactly. Mom, we have chicken filet at home. And I said to the waitress, I think you got my order wrong. I wanted chicken filet and you gave me chicken tenders. And they're like, no, no, no, no, no. This is chicken filet. And you make chicken tenders, things like cardboard. That's the $10 chicken tender pack from ShopBoss. Literally, that's what they warmed me up because I had that before and it tasted exactly like that. Microwaved 50% breading. Exactly. Dude, it was just breading. Exactly invalid input. That is how bad that tastes. So this is going to be jails. And then right here, you're going to see like a fog on the floor. And when you go below the fog, Mario is going to freeze kind of like how it does in Hazy Maze Cave in the dirt. Yeah, OK, Lina, breading is fine. But if the breading is like more than 50% of the meal and all you taste is just like the meat is like an excuse to eat breading and oil, like it's just not good. Levels with jail cells four. Do we actually have that many? You think this is going to look cool with the mirror Mario there? Didn't taste like rubber. It actually just tasted like cardboard. It's an excuse to save money. Yeah, but I didn't expect to just get so blatantly ripped off. The zoo, the ship, this one and Bowser too. I think that's fair, right? You think we shouldn't have jails here? I mean, it is a castle, right? The castle would have jail cells. Kind of establishment in the diner though. It was just a restaurant somewhere, I don't know. You think of garlic bread? It's pretty good. I kind of don't like how the visibility here is. I think they wouldn't jail the enemies, they would just freeze them in ice. Okay. You know what? What if instead of jail cells, this is just like frozen walls and there's people behind the frozen walls. What's the verdict on chicken filet? People said I got scammed. Okay, so I think this is bad because you can't actually see Mario walking here and that's like half the appeal. I think this is a bit better. We're going to skunk area on Wednesdays and I have got to show you the shit they eat over here. Is it? You guys know that SpongeBob episode with the fake Krabby Patties that are just made out of mud? That's what I imagine skunk cafeteria food to be like. I have never eaten the food at school. I always brought my own cafeteria food is so expensive for no reason. And so shit. Would making the wall you don't walk in from a mirror help with visibility? No, I don't think so. Paid for it, yeah. School cafeteria food. You have to pay for it. LSU belts. Do not worry. I will keep packing those Marios. Okay, so we need to add the way back from here to the main area. And we also need to add the way here. I will not tell you what this is. Oh my God. Dude, they're serving literal dog shit. This looks disgusting. It's chocolate pickle. Sure. Hey guys, this is not dog shit, I swear. It's a chocolate pickle. What's on the menu today? Trum. Just poor kids, man. How expensive are meals at your school? I don't know. I did not buy a meal a single time because every time they had food, it looked bad. Also, I'm the kind of kid if my mom gives me $3 for food. I'm going to keep the $3 and go hungry. But you need to realize that my mom would never give me money for school because she would know that I would just keep it and not buy food. CEO grinds it from the get-go. Dude, I don't think I have spent money for anything for fun in my entire life past the age of 5 or so, except for Super Smash Brothers Brawl when it came out. And you guys are saying it's true. But that's not really spending it, right? Because it still reserves some value. You can just resell that. Can you buy a RetroBlaster to make NXR cartridges? Yeah, but that's actually like an investment. I do need that for my YouTube channel. And I did make the Valuigi's Tango Stand cartridge, which netted me $600. So honestly, the RetroBlaster thing was a plus $400 for me. 15 euros worth of food. Yeah, I used to live like that too when I was in Bremen. I had to eat off of $70 a month. I used to live off of 300 euros every month and 220 of those were rent. Should I buy a Good Condition OG one or a Hori Pad Mini? I'm not quite sure. I like the Hori design. There's the Brawler. The Brawler is pretty good. I like it. Maybe you should try that one. 220 for rent is super cheap. It was 8 square meters though. That's also a good way to do it N-Pen. It's not a concern. I could spend more. I just cook a lot. So it's cheap. Oh, well nowadays I can't eat that cheap. I need like 3,500 calories a day. Okay, so why are the stream tags on Twitch English and Gargoyle? Gargoyle? Gargoyle my balls? That's why. Bro fell for it. Come on. You fell for it dude. You got what's coming to you. What about the Brawler? Right, you still have the Z button here, right? It's like the same as with a vanilla controller. It's on your left finger, right? With the vanilla controller, you'd have your hand here, which is also the Z button. So it is the same. The only difference here is that you have easy access to the D-Pad. If you want to use it and to the L button. So really it just gives you access to all of this here for free. And the start button is a bit more convenient too. Is this how I get treats on my first stream I watch on Twitch? Well, yes. Dude, I have heard of the monkey food guy. That's crazy that you've heard of that. Okay, let me think about this though. How do we best do this? I need the player to go down here somewhere or I could just remove this entire thing. Honestly, that wouldn't be such a bad decision either. The thing I like about this though is that if a player goes like here, they can just go back. Then again, this whole apparatus here is kind of useless, but I do like how it interconnects the castle, you know? By the way, do you really want that question answered? If you're being a hundred percent real with us here. What if instead of this, that was just a warp pipe from here to here and then we remove this and those are connected by a warp pipe. I think that could work well. And then maybe we have a Yoshi coin up here. Yeah, let's do that. Fuck it. Idea, a slide section with a loop. All I got is Sonic. There's plenty of sliding here, but I don't think I want to do a loop. That feels like it's, you know, it's too random. It's not really within the theme of the ice castle. I think making a game is all about designing a feeling that you want the player to have and that just doesn't fit the feeling of this area. I'm sorry, but you just come with a decent amount of time anyway. But it's tofu natural, isn't it? Just very, very processed plant. I don't make a slight bend goes down from the bottom of the world to the top of the world using infinite staircase from the eastern is a trip. That does sound actually very cool. I do kind of like that. That is a very cool idea. There should be something like that somewhere. I mean, just note down the Yoshi coin here. Yoshi coin in Big M is a secret warp pipe. Tofu is processed like almond milk or something is processed. Oh, I see. Wait, then what is it made from? Hello, Boris. Yes, I'm very fast, but I'm not even the fastest. I'm just doing some common sense stuff. If I actually had good mouse precision, that would be so much faster. Or if I actually like tried all the shortcuts and stuff. Idea slide section with the disappearing bullshit. I think those mix well. Yeah. We can we can write this down. Let's just more ideas. Slides with disappearing stuff and Infinite staircase style slides between the parts of the castle milk from soybeans I'm making into those blocks from what I remember oh so you're just filtering out the fat I guess I released the source code whenever my mods done because if I release it before then I dig my whole mod so I don't want that I don't want people to just you know take my mods because if people play it early they're not gonna like it you know what I could do if we have the the warp slide here we could make a slide go down from here and come out here and then we can make a slide like go down here and come out from here you know what I mean that would be kind of neat yeah no I know what you mean Dave I think it's a cool idea oh yeah the source code release is a hundred percent plant I have already released an old version of the source code with peaches fury case you should port our device external devices lighting engine to our DX and PC port let me open my DMS with wise guy real quick just so I can he said he said this I know you don't care about ports I didn't even don't really think it actually interesting but if you ever wanted we could discuss recompiling RT by I so it's honestly not out of the question we were having a few plans here that goes on wall but pops out of another wall in the same room seamlessly like a portal well it would be something like that but like castle why do you know what I mean I think doing both ideas is a little a hello music's out um any OST suggestions Rila are you vegan no okay cuz you know so much about vegan you come out my team I recomb it's possible just veganism strongest soldier and transgenderism strongest soldier to ICAC dude Lila it's your month actually that's sick you know what we're just listen to the same album again forget can you believe it they made a whole month's just for Lila it's the Lambo okay let me plan this so we come out here we go in here fine we come out here when do we go in I don't know can't go in here what if it's just here just some no that's lame what if you go down here and you come out here or you go down here and you come out here or you could go down here and come out here I would like if you go down here and come out here actually and then this could just be the warp pipe to here yo thank you for the donation and pen I will keep it up do not worry I'm sorry if I missed YouTube channel a little bit it is kind of hard to pay attention to everything going on at the same time while also to help them again and some you know that just drinking a cigarette with optimized code applied to it yeah yeah I mean that's the plan right but I still need to isolate all my improvements for that to happen which is a lot of work especially while I'm still actively developing and that's kind of likely to happen I like this video my mind forecast instead of just castle yeah that was the idea right yeah well hopefully one day I will have time to decouple all the improvements it's just gonna be something in the future and I still need to import Sauron's Trace as soon as I can can't forget about that don't know if you guys you guys definitely have not seen it but Sauron basically made a cool thing that traces when which a thread runs and for how long so with that essentially you get a full overview of everything going on in the frame and like when it's going on which helps a lot with performance you could port the all I have not seen Coastcoat no Iceborn they're like dry bones but made out of ice and hit they shatter into small chunks dude the dry bone guy would love that and that's a cool idea but where are you have okay so this and this is connected this warps to this I'm gonna mark the warps here somehow it's like a red triangle warp just so we don't forget about it and then this is literally just a warp pipe I did you a slight section that is a rooting piece like this sorry for my mouse writing oh yeah we have there is something very similar with the crystals the problem is that anything like that is very difficult for players to deal with so we'd have to brainstorm ideas on how to make sure that players can actually deal with it also the problem with that is that we would need like a big slide and rather I just want like an icy castle full of small slides having a big slide somewhere could kind of work actually I feel like we can just put that together with the 8-bit pipe maybe maybe it's not one path that's the slides nothing else really bring back the last impact difficulty I mean a lot of that difficulty is gonna be there just less jank and more like you get the difficulty you want that's kind of the beauty in Mario 64 in that the game is as difficult as you make it you always have the option to do something extremely risky extremely difficult to pull off that makes you go faster but you also have the option to take a safe route right I feel like that's kind of the idea with Mario 64 so the game is as difficult as you are brave and if you're just not brave sure the game will be easy but that's honestly on you I was wondering how the code works that keeps Mario on the moving rotating that I'm probably gonna do you know they get it kind of works via matrices I think they get like a positional officer to you and then they rotate and they apply the rotation matrix that is the difference between the two rotations and see how much the point moved on that matrix and then move Mario but that amount Rainbow Ride is objectively hard well Rainbow Ride is hard because you're gonna die of boredom this is actually something insane I've noticed playing Yoshi's Woolly World the bosses in that game that are twice speed are easier than the bosses in that game that are one time speed because the bosses and one time speed are so fucking boring then I just stop paying attention to the game I just can't focus on it I think the object is more transparent this Mario's solo class is transparent that's not how parenting works no not the Mario 64 sure that's probably one way to do it but no that's just not how it works it's the same math that you would do with a parent but you're actually not parenting anything you're just doing the math well you're not a branch out of Mars exterminate your own full game yes yes I will I'm actually already working in Unreal Engine five for a different company I'm in a loop I know why I'm able to find file that was scary come on there we go where were you when RGYI kill no that was my PC not my code yeah this will work with the mirror and this should be easy enough because you really don't need to be very flat against the wall for this to work perfect forming RPG mm dude I've been waiting so long 1964 hopefully one day I had someone have the insane idea in my discord they posted this to render the game at 160 by 120 but then afterwards use one of those AI upscaling algorithms to render the game at full res and honestly I think that might work I think it's not impossible that that would work I'm gonna be a tomodachi let's go dude free DLSS on n64 exactly what's an FSR Morris I don't know these tech words I just know how to program n64 if there is a DLSS that is trained on 160 by 120 and we can run it on Mars 64 I absolutely want to try it because I think it has potential I think it could work imagine you just have an option to turn DLSS on or off in your Mario 64 hack dude I hope it looks like shit yeah but imagine if it doesn't do it making mods would be so weird from then on oh it's AMD's open source DLSS stuff and not the AI stuff oh dude if we can port that that would be a sick thing to try so this should be yeah okay this is the special war but this actually needs to go the other way around dude this looks wild I want an area like this in the game oh I hadn't even thought about using a texture like that that looks even crazier than I thought it would honestly DLSS on n64 seems like a James Lambert video he seems like the type to do tech stuff like that can you use this for every bottomless pit here I can give that a try yo thank you for the subscription Jonas98 all right let's give biomech's idea and try here so you say something well we probably don't want exactly what we had there right let's let's find the texture that looks reasonable for this bottomless pit here black alpha noise texture okay I have an idea I have a stupid idea is this the same one I think it is Hello EtherEck Hello It's Chris30Mon It's a surreal looking ice castle So we have a bunch of like trippy stuff going on here but we also have a bunch of not trippy stuff going on It's uhm A bunch of ice enemies A scared village that is scared of the ice castle basically I don't know Hard to describe what I want Okay, I think this is a good way of doing it Let's take a look at it, see if it works out. The objUpdateFloor seems to only update Mario's height to the floor, do you happen to know the function actually handles the moving Mario to the new location of the moving polygon? It's the step function in every individual action state. I have made my own version of it. Your sub button won't come up, I ensure nothing happens, oh, well, thank you for the sub, either way. This did not work the way that we wanted it to work, why? Why is there just a black render at the bottom? How is it being cleared with black? Is it not? No, it's not being cleared with black, it's just too transparent, yeah, too opaque. It's not cut, it's not supposed to be cut out. Okay, so we had one shot or one of you didn't see everything you ever wanted in one moment, would you capture it or would you just let it slip? I think, I believe truly if you are in the situation there and you can choose to either capture it or let it slip, you should capture it. I don't know if this is a controversial take. Oh my God, this looks insane. A slide with that, yeah, I'm thinking that a slide with that would go hard. This is not the source engine void, this is like on purpose, you see how it looks like it's like flaming there or something. This looks extremely cool to me. I don't think it's usable here though, because as you can see, there's level under or actually, no, the level is not going to be shown. You're not going to see the level here while you're up there. Infinite falling section. An infinite falling section would be cool. The problem is once you bonk somewhere, you're just going to be stuck forever. Insane idea. What's this insane idea? I'm fine with this being at the voids, by the way, don't misunderstand me here. I do not care about Hasbun Hotel. That's my opinion. I've not watched it. I do not want to watch it. Have you guys seen that tweet where one person's like, I'm not planning. I haven't watched the BTS video and one of the BTS fans, like, that's kind of disrespectful. You should have said you haven't watched it yet. You can imply that you're not interested in watching it. I don't know, man. I mean, everyone for themselves, but like, that's kind of disrespectful. During the fight on the roof, one of the AX of the bosses, the entire area flips upside down and marathons into the sky with this effect that has to dodge stars. Okay, yes, that fits. I like that a lot, actually. One attack is in flipping the level upside down. Mario falls into the sky and has to dodge stars. The frame rather is cleared with that thing and this effect. Yeah, yeah, very fitting. Because in Yoshi's Island, there's also gravity shenanigans going on. There's plenty of effects where you just drive a cart. Yes. Yes. And it still feels good. Oh, yeah. What do you think of my reflective wall here? I think it looks like shit. This one, too. I don't like this one, either. Yes, there is an enemy that freezes you into an ice cube. But it's not Sonic Mania inspired. It's Last Impact inspired.  That gives me the egg. Would not marry. Needs to get into finance. Needs to be 6'5". I'm getting the egg here. Yeah. Why is this Adventure of Mario and Luigi? I have not watched it, either. Is that real? Well, it's not my own fork of GCC. It's Easy As Pie's fork, basically. Easy As Pie made this for N64 with some guidelines. Okay. So, our next struggle. There needs to be a way from the snowman area back to the main area. Because what if you don't want to go to the snowman area? Do you see the fucking GCC? You're not stamping. Okay. What's a GCC? When you use public travel bus, specifically. The last time I've been on a bus was probably 2020 or so. CN valid input. I used to use a bus fairly regularly. Back when I was playing Smash Bros Melee and traveling for that game. But now, I don't. Do I want to watch the Mario and Luigi Adventure? Oh, God. That's way too much. I'm not watching that right now. Is that like a shitpost dub? Do I have a big and masculine American car? Yeah. If the pollution from my car does not kill at least 15 animals every year. I am not satisfied with my car. I do want to pay $2,000 a month in insurance and gas. Also, imagine pulling up to a friend's house and he has a bigger car than you. Doesn't that make you feel not masculine enough? I don't know. I don't know what car people think. Panzerkampfwagen. Yeah. I show up in a Panzerkampfwagen when I go visit my friend. And then I shoot bullets at his house. Just to show him I'm in charge, you know? Hello, Ellie. Ellie, I hope my talk, my passion for cars has not turned you off the stream. I'm just very, very passionate about big cars. Okay. Do we just make a little slide back? Just like it's like the slides at the beginning here. But like one goes back here. It could kind of work. I could also have like,        Statues or staircases here. Honestly, I don't like when people say Nintendo should have just used faster memory. Because then clearly that would have been more expensive, right? Like, how do you, as just a random guy on Reddit or YouTube, know that that's the most cost efficient way to make the console faster? Yeah, I got these nuts. True. What did I do? Oh, there we go. Did you ever just downloaded more RAM? Yeah, then that's basically the vibe I'm getting from that. It'd be kind of like staircases here and then like a slide down. Something like this. Yeah. Why don't they have one like that on each side? Is that a viable layout? I think having some random symmetry everywhere is kind of neat, because it's like a castle. Mario doesn't get a velocity from that. I mean, he does get inertia on my repo, but that's not how it works in most repos. Are you looking at Hackam R64, maybe? Because they have platforming displacement, too. Sure, but what's the point of that? Oh, interesting. I did not know that. But also just having more RAM. If you make hardware mods, you can make stronger ones. If you make hardware mods, just play on emulator. Also, hello, Tharo. Did not expect you to see here. That's pretty cool. It's the castle of a throne room. It should where the big bosses. I'm productive all the time. Sour, do you need another district? Yeah, we already have some statues here, and we're going to add paintings. For now, we're not actually making the level beautiful, though. We're just planning out the platforming, and then afterwards, we're going to try to make it look good. But if we do both at the same time, then we're going to spend a lot of time making stuff look good that is not even going to make it into the game. I'm going to add statues.   What do you think of Cartoon Sentiments fandom? Like with the new Starwing ROM-MEC, that makes the game run at decent speed by using the Super FX2 chip instead of the FX1 chip. I think that's similar. For example, I try to stay within the 64 megabytes limit because I do want to do this whole thing with the technology of the time. Or rather with the hardware of the time, not the technology. Almost made it. Let's try the other one. Oh, Mushi, you haven't heard this. Basically, Sawa needed a diss track made. I think that's it.        I think this is a bit awkward, how you land on the invisible stuff. But considering how you get there, you might just know what's there. Also, you can probably just do that. No, you can't. I can add a platform here below, though, that you can just jump up on, which we probably should do anyway because then it's going to feel safer to just trust the platform there. Like right here. Technology of... No, no, the hardware. You know what I mean? Like the game itself could run with the same hardware. Besides, I don't use Shen Chen PD that much. Does that mean you're just... No, no, no, it's against Sawa. Basically, Sawa wanted some beef. And then he got his beef. And then he got his beef. It was an absolute shitpost thing, but you know. I'm a bit worried that the death warp is going to be too high up here. Oh, I guess actually it doesn't matter because the room here will be invisible. So you won't actually see this. Yeah. Yeah, true. I mean, you can just look at the decom. I mean, sure, it would be funny, Sawa, but no one knows who you are. You're literally just too irrelevant for that room, like, to have mass appeal. And that's not even me dissing you, that's just me speaking the truth. Yeah, I think that works. Can you put a mesh there or would ruin the theme? We can put a mesh there. We can put meshes wherever we want. Okay, let's recap all the stars real quick and see if we have a decent layout now. First star, platforming gauntlet to a star you see early on, but can't reach until later. The star is going to be right here behind the glass. You can't reach it, because to reach it you need to go up here. You can exit this way and do some platforming up here and get a bit like that, which I think that's fine. Then the other way is through here, here, up here, through here, and then this way. Good. I think that feels nice and open. That should be fine. Star 2, the snowman cave path. For the snowman cave path, you need to go through here, get up here, do the slide jump, and then we actually have like a linear section here. Should work. Boss fight with the big raven. To get to the big raven, you need to end the platforming gauntlet here, which has the ice blocks, and it's the stairs, and then it has the boss fight. That should be fine. Or alternatively, you can go through the abyss and skip the ice blocks, but then you have to go through the abyss for the cold haze rooms. This is a completely separate thing. I'm still not 100% sure on these jumps here. They seem a little very difficult, but you can also just kind of skip them, so maybe it's fine. Red's outside. Okay, we don't need to account for that. Bit pipe via hidden entrance from the outside should be in one of the jail cells. So the idea is that there's a bit pipe here. You get there through like a slide outside, and then inside the jail cell, you will find the pipe. Since we are going with the idea of making ice walls, I'm just gonna move this back a thousand coordinates so we can have to stand out a little bit more. I think it's 0xf1. We haven't found the magical function yet. Apply platform displacement with underscores in between the words. This game does not have the fire flower, and I don't want it here. F6. Again, we tend to move windows a little. Yes, there's windows. There's a window here that blows you around, which you just made me realize that we should use this a lot more. Oops. We should have used that here. Well, I guess we can just use it as an option.         That's an obstacle, too. It's a cool thing about the window, it can be an obstacle or a helper. Well, these are supposed to look like windows, I guess they don't really do that yet. We also still need to fill this room here and this room here. I just realized we didn't put anything there yet. Welcome back, AetherEgg. I don't want ice skating. We have plenty of mechanics, we just need to use them well. So just using ice skating or something like that is not something I want. We should make use of all the mechanics we have first. Hello Yoji named Ace. Did you guys play the Haka release today? And if so, what did you think? Oh yeah, that's kind of pointless to go up here or in here. Well, I guess this one's kind of cool for like just seeing the level. What hack? You guys don't even know? What the hell? You guys don't even know that I released a hack today? This one here. I'm just going to speedrun it real quick. That time I became friends with the Royal Scuttlebug family and fell from space. It's a very cute hack. What is this? It's a romhack about becoming friends with the Royal Scuttlebugs. I don't know what a vibe this is. Chittering camera rotation. I must have missed that. Isn't this cool as fuck? Yeah, it's just easier to work with stream music. That's a skip by the way. Are you cheating on me with another guy for your models? This is with Eiza. Eiza, send us, send us. I know you are very, very busy. That's why you get to rework my models to make sure they look good. This is just going to like pass one of my models basically. Well, this is still Eiza's model here. The water is very nice. See? Okay. The one thing I made about the level is the water. And I made it like a little more visible. But yeah, visibility was a big issue here. And this is the part of the hack I made. That you can just skip if you're good at Mario 64. How much time was this made? I think I spent maybe like a week on my slides and then I went a little bit back and forth with Eiza. But this was just like a side project that I did like, you know, not spending a lot of time on it. Did SimpleFlips need like 15 attempts to land on this? It is so easy though. And that's basically the whole hack already. It's a very small hack. I don't think it looks that good, Moshi. As Tami said, shit was easy. We had the last number of spider walls and it is easy. Also, you just saw me first try the whole thing with skips and everything. And then at the end, everyone's happy. Then look at Mario. Look at Mario. He's doing the dance. I wish I could outsource all the asset making and make the evil corporation. Ninety nine percent of the budget went into the cutscenes. A good amount of our time was on the cutscenes, yeah. Why can I not? I need more money to make the evil corporation. Oh, I have an idea for the section, actually. Let me just fix that. Put a cube here. Didn't Pi make like a slide hack? And it's like you play it and it's like, holy shit, this slide is cool. And then you keep playing and it's like, oh my God, I'm getting so sick of slides. It was a cool idea. It's just the slides get exhausting quick. That's why in my slide, I broke it up with normal platforming. No more saved microseconds, no more Yoshi plushies, no Rambo's room room. I'll sacrifice the Yoshi plushies. It's fine for me without the plushies, honestly. Oh. I just got yes, it's even linked below in the description. You like the logo of the slide hack that much? More than RTY's? Dang. That's unfortunate. Because we kind of just threw that shit together. You ate it? No way. No, it's still here. I see it. It's right there. It must be linked, you definitely ate it. All right, well, I guess I believe you. It's like, why would someone just go on the Internet and lie? Sometimes you respond to chat like you. No way. I would never treat you guys like a toddler. You guys are my special little boys. Still unable to join my discount. I don't know what to do about it, honestly. Biobank, careful how you talk to me or I'm going to take your nose. Your nose is going to be gone. Not my nose. I don't know what to do about an XPM. Maybe ask Pablo or someone who knows. Maybe ask beta actually beta knows to this kind of stuff, I think. Yes, of course, the other Pablo. Or do you know this stuff? Are you a mod on my discord server, Pablo? I don't think you are. To Nintendo music. No. No. No.  No.  No. No.  I'm kind of worried that the player is going to get stuck behind here, but I don't think it's an issue. Let's try it. All right. Enjoy your tuna sandwich. The bottom of the platforms isn't mollos. It's not supposed to be. It's going to be like one of those ice bridges with snow hanging from the sides. Okay, that jump is entirely impossible. That jump is just never going to happen. I guess you can do that. Yeah, this section sucks. I don't like this at all. I don't like this at all. I don't like this at all. I don't like this at all. Okay. I don't like this at all. This should be a little bit better. I don't think I want this on the other side, because on the other side, there's this thing here. Then these two need to be moved down a little bit. Maybe like so. And then you still can't get there, which sucks. There could be a little bit of like a statue here, and then you land on the statue. I think that could look very impressive. Kind of like so. And then there's like a statue here that you stand on something kind of this shape. Let's see how that works out platforming wise. Depending on downloading cars, I would do that. Absolutely.  So don't work while streaming. Don't you feel like you got to work and engage with chat at the same time? Yeah, that is true. Although it's also like easier to focus when you're streaming. You can't really get distracted, you know? Why is that so funny? So there's definitely a lot of momentum gained here. I do think we need to go a little bit higher, though. Give me an idea how to do while watching your stream. Find a job as like a cashier, and then you can watch my stream while you make money and you can donate the money you make to me. Yeah. There should probably be a lower cap on the speed you can get here. Yeah. I think this works well. It's just going to be looking a little bit ugly for now, but I think this is a solvable problem. Right. You come here for the entrance. You look. I mean, you see a big slide here, but then if you like go past the slides, maybe you see like a big statue over there that you can climb. Camera really is my biggest concern in this construction here. So the wind needs a lower cap. The wind does not have a cap. Cool. I think that means stretching the stream is boring. Damn. But no, I don't think there's a stream I could watch in the entire world without doing something else. Yeah, that's too much inertia. I think this should just be reduced when you're long jumping. What? This is something else I'm doing, working on my mod. I killed a dinosaur with that sneeze? No, I didn't mean to. Okay, that one works perfectly. The other one's a little weirder. I mean, you can always just save it. And it's not like there's anything valuable here, although it's gonna be more annoying that there's something valuable here or not. I don't know. We also should make it so that the doors kind of block the camera, because that way when you go through something, you're not gonna be bothered by that. Song request? Wait, that's a Discord link. XPM, you need to send a YouTube link, not a Discord invite. I think this one is a little bit misleading. I don't like it. Oh, YouTube link. Let's go. What are we listening to? Oh no. Oh. Then I'm done. Then I'm done. What a banger. Is this song in Fast and Furious? From Kirby music? I hate Kirby music man. I can't do it anymore. I can't do it anymore. I miss when Paper Mario didn't have EXP and levels. True. Back in the day. But then they released the first one and ruined the whole thing. I can't do it anymore. I can't do it anymore. I can't do it anymore. I can't do it anymore. Heart type beat. Thank you. So glad you enjoy and share my taste in music. I don't know what we're listening to by the way. This just came on on autoplay. Wait, this is this is the the anime edgy music. The AMV music. I can't do it anymore. I can't do it anymore. I have never seen the appeal of the. It's just B-movie scripts, fitness, grand pisa tests, cock and ball torture. It's like the same joke all three of those. I can't do it anymore. The joke is that it's funny. That's not how jokes work. I'm just saying it's funny because it's funny. I can't do it anymore. I think I may have messed up making the windows. No, they're not very versatile. Snow effects. Well, it's not going to snow inside the castle. Yeah, you know what I mean? It's kind of messed up. It's not it's not very usable here. I think I need to make a separate version of it that doesn't have the last part. You know what? I'm going to put on the song that actually sucks balls. If you guys keep saying that. Fuck all of you. We're going to listen to songs that actually suck balls. Now. Let me just let me just go into my like videos playlist here. I can't switch account. I can't actually go to my like videos. Cool. I'm locked. Cause probably because I'm streaming. Awesome. I am not playing Tango. Tango is the worst. Let's try this. Wait, we start at three. It should work though. Let's see how this works out. I either just fuck the door and just fix that. Oh yeah, that's way better. Nice, that's clean. Let's try this one. So we're done with this on. The thing is. Yeah. First issue is going to be the camera here. Because like, it's going to suck. Unless the camera like automatically snaps this close, then maybe you can think to just go here. But you're going to be confused as to what to do. And then maybe you can see that. Still, this sucks. But you can make it over here pretty easily now. But yes, the camera will be an issue in tight indoor rooms like this. We could just move the camera in some of these rooms to like a hard corner position. Which I also don't like. The Ocarina of Time does that? Holy shit. Did you go into a NoBlender project to do that for the wind? I went into a file just for the wind here. I have a separate file for the wind. The problem is the camera needs to transition smoothly. Otherwise it's going to mess with your movement. Because you're going to be expecting one camera behavior and then getting another. Alternatively, we can remove this room entirely. And instead get the space here to make a better camera. I think that's probably our better option here.  This level very much is like the form-follows-function-time deal, I think. I just hope it won't look too ugly in the end. I don't know. I don't know. Let's check how the camera works out. And this is why it looks like shit now. Because we're still figuring out all the platforming. We don't want to spend any time making it pretty before we don't have the platforming. Yeah, this feels much more reasonable to do now. There's still the issue that you can't really see that side though. But I have a solution for that as well. First of all, this should be lowered down. Second of all, we're going to subdivide this side of the thing here. So that the camera can go further back. 300. 300. I don't like that. That should be 250 on each side. You missed the sub A mods. Oh, he's, he's begging. Not begging, begging. You know what I mean? The type of begging where I'm like, not really begging. You're just kind of like doing the implied begging. I'm going to write on the slide dramatic you made the video about later today. To make sure, but I worried that the star hut element is too far left. It's going to get counted by overkill on my CRT. I don't think it will. It shouldn't. But yeah, sounds like a good plan. I hope that works well. And also interesting thing that Romic isn't even supposed to have the hut. I just accidentally left it in the entire hut as a useless at that game. But yeah, if it does cut off, that would be very good to know, because then I can fix it in this room and care. Can you do a backflip yet? Kinda. I guess the best way to do it is with a long jump. Oh, definitely not. It's a side flip. Okay, that's a cool platforming though. I'm liking the way you move through this level here. I don't know, what do you guys think of the platforming in this level? You think it's working out well so far? Feels like I have a lot of freedom in how I want to approach the level. I think I can skip this here. Have we tried this pipe before? It works. The game can lay out over some of the textures very cool. Oh, it looks like it's a text gen, but it's not actually. This is just a shifting texture. Wait, is this what you meant, this brick? Or did you mean the other ones? Because there's some with text gen and some without it. This one is with text gen? Okay, yeah, this one's definitely with text gen. And then the walls just kind of fake that, so I can do it without a decal, without still having texture mapping. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, it looks very fitting for ice. You can even, if you want, you can go back here. But it's very difficult without taking damage. But yeah, here's text gen too. This one's smooth because I wanted it to be shiny. And then we got the penguins here, which I wanted to look sculpted, like the potatoes when I peeled them instead of my mom. Oh yeah, we have to remove the lobby items now. Okay, so what is missing? This room here and the entire underground area here with the icy fog. Then the last room is done again. And this room, I'm not 100% certain on this room yet. This one feels kind of poopy. See that, Davey? I'm also not 100% sure on this, the back and forth. I think doing it once is fun. Doing it twice, maybe. Doing it three times, a little much. Especially because the camera here isn't great. Either way, we'll be thinking about this some other time. I think this will be the end of my stream. And I will see you guys in the next stream next Saturday. Bye-bye.
