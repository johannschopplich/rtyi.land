You Oh I think it's a black face counting disabled And it's the same here and this one's actually less of an issue and a selton Hey keys, are you going to stream? No, not today Yeah Yeah, the stream today is fake I Forgot that I need this It works works, that's cool All right, let's add a warp out to this and then I think the side level is done That's cool Thinking early about asking you if he was eligible to decide I was when we talked about in stream a couple of weeks ago I'm not sure what you're talking about We need to be more specific It's a really nice water ripple animation, I didn't see a water ripple animation On this This one actually does still need some visuals I know a lecho room. Yeah. Hello Akai guy I mean that would I be able sure if you are good enough at modeling I wouldn't want someone making a side level who produces more work for me than he solves So there is like a level of skill you need for your work to be accepted Over the signature they look sickly. That's a bummer You I said, I'm gonna work in a world event. Okay, we did not do that yet You Are right on that it is something I wanted to do at one point, but I'm not sure if I want to do that any longer We need to add the warp out to the world, what are the red lines? Oh, these are seams So near seams I marked a new view map and then I can UV unwrap it this much faster And I didn't actually do this part yet. Let me show you what I can do afterwards. So You see how this causes like a seam to exist in the UV map Like so What I can do afterwards is I can take this entire seam Move it here to where it overlaps Like so Make sure they overlap the exact UV coordinates. Now this looks awful for a second, but then Now it's seamless isn't that fucking cool Of course it's still not perfect. I Also fucked this part up. Oh my god, I fucked that part up. Oops You What happened here I think that was supposed to go there. There's over here Yeah, well you get the idea Yes, I am shaved. Would you rather poop out watermelon or pee out a cranberry? probably I think they would both kill me True John Lurie, that is very true And just use the entire material to use cube protection. Yeah, that would look pretty awful and cause a bunch of seams to exist You There we go perfectly seamless You You beam mapping is a prerequisite for 3d modeling you can't get away without it still need to you beam up the tree as well Bro is sitting on a chair. I look at this loser. He has a chair What a loser You I don't think 0xEE is used yet If I use keep face attributes only here I fall for testing Don't know what it is, don't use it Don't know what it is, don't use it Hello SquishyStache I don't know what it is, don't use it I don't know what it is, don't use it We should get a new water shader still Just make sure exiting works now It does, looks good Alright, then we just need to fix the UV map for the tree And then I think the level is finished Maybe I'll just have to jump, pretty sure you can I guess you don't really gain a lot of speed because everything is seeding I'm sure you can get a proper BLJ off him Get a standing nest to prevent back pain I'm actually getting a standing nest soon as part of a sponsorship But I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it We should copy the texture from this tree here Or, well actually, I don't think we need to do that Let's just make this seamless so that in the future that's as easy to do Okay, is this a cube projection? Is that what it looks like? What are these little silly individual triangles in the UV map? Anyway, the way you would properly UV map something like this is you would Mark steam here Select all this, press U twice And then what I would, let me actually just triangulate it first And then what I do is I select one side Straighten it, okay that's a bad one, straighten it Straighten it like this Straighten it like this Like this, okay that's a good straightening This is all a little too wide for me Maybe I can straighten this part here, oh that's better And then I need to make this roughly aligned to an edge here Something like that Something like that Something like that And like so And then the easiest thing to do is just make this zero This zero Align the heights of the vertices And just make it bigger until it's roughly one repetition Like so, take this, move it on over, now it's seamless How's your wrist? My wrist is slowly getting better I was at a Canadian doctor recently on Wednesday And Canadian doctors are actually insane, they actually listen to you They actually try to find a solution, they don't treat you like you're fucking stupid It's crazy I'm actually feeling somewhat optimistic about my wrist after going to the doctor I think it's only going to take two to three weeks to heal now Is that on? Yes, that's the Magic UV add-on That's the three UV maps And then gymming with the industry Well, there's some exercises I can't do, but I'm doing the exercises that I can do Yes, I have seen Pyro in 64 I spoke to Hiltododongo, the guy that made it And he thinks it is a good idea for me to make a video about it at some point But we're going to wait maybe two or three months first So that the first wave of users is done with it And all the low-hanging fruit optimizations are fixed There's also one massive unoptimization in LibDragon That is costing you easily 30% of FPS That can be fixed though And once it is fixed, Pyro's performance is going to be a lot better So those are the two things I want out of the way Before I help him advertise Pyroid Or make a video about Pyroid Help myself advertise Pyroid Yeah, just a performance issue That is LibDragon, not Pyroid And I'm the first wave of testers out of the way Something about this rock feels bald to me It's like it's missing vertex colors Gotta fix that Is it all Rayman-esque? This texture feels so low-resolution, am I crazy? It is very low-resolution That's a little higher resolution That's a bit stupid though It is How much did I ever get in some stagement commissions? I don't know, how good are you? If you're bad at it, you'd be lucky if someone wants your work at all And if you're really good at it, and there's a commercial game You could possibly charge thousands I think I just need to put them On top of here It's not apparent, but I'm going to have to wait For something in the initial game to come out of it To kind of figure out how to get GLB mods up to it Fair enough Do you have any advice for 3D artists who want to learn to code on the N64? Coding for the N64 is super easy, especially with LibDragon I don't think you need any advice, just code I've heard that some people are afraid to start hobbies Because they're afraid of failing at them or something And I think, I feel, or I notice That people are this way with programming When reality is just start and it is going to work out Hello friend, your content is so amazing So I give you a follow, I just want to be your friend So we can stream together I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it But I'm going to try Can we stream together and share ideas together? No, I want to stream with you Who are you? Hello, my name is Mario We need a song for the stage What do you think of the visuals of the stage now? Does it look more like an RTY eye level? Now that I changed the vertex colors a bit Made the mushrooms higher poly Gave them the padded headcase twist I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it But I'm going to try I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it But I'm going to try Wow, Mario is really quiet I didn't notice that I didn't notice that These things are sickly as fuck Is it because of the colors? Because they're like desaturated Is Underdog from Mario Paint in this? It honestly might be, I'm not sure anymore There are some characters from Mario Paint in this In my opinion, this is the best looking issue In my opinion, the most handsomest YouTuber on the planet is Kazumaru, who is just an unbiased observer So, side level finished, that feels good Alright, let's look for the next piece of work we can do We have the Shy Guy Seeg level, it is done And this is done Your level is ready for me? Let's go back to that then I think I'm near the level Dariel, but it's not as good as Dariel, I'm not a biomech You think biomech is better than Dariel? That's interesting I never thought about it was better, but that's not the level we're working on This is the level we're working on again today It is Marty's level Alright Marty, do you have all the files for me? Did you edit the level in any way? I think you wanted to reduce vertex counts again or something Discord They're already in there? Did I just not think about it? Oh yeah, you did send them like 6 days ago And I just didn't download them I was so busy the last few days, you guys have no idea how stressful it is I'm officially buying the house right now My parents were there, my little baby is yapping She's running around with 2 Yoshis stacked on top of each other Going double Yoshi, double Yoshi My life is tumultuous I don't know why, but fast64 renders just stop working for me Yeah I do It's something my dad ordered I don't know why, but fast64 renders just stop working for me I don't know why, but fast64 renders just stop working for me My dad is just teaching the baby nonsense Do you have a changelog for me, Marty? Like what should I be aware of? And maybe this will look fun at the end Maybe not Hello Kreitzra I'm glad you like him I'm thinking about making a video about illegal n64 modeling techniques Or well, I'm not just thinking about it, it's basically already done So that will be the next video It has a lot of cool stuff Dirt path and rocks opaque, texture are too big And rocks opaque Oh my god, the lag Oh my god, let me select the thing I'm guessing this is supposed to be an I4 And I like illegal LEGO techniques exactly like that It used to be so bad last time, so I'm changing the blender Hey, I'm not sure, I don't think I made a change Before Codefiance, were you already a programmer? Not really MIPS Assembly was kind of my first programming language I mean, I did some programming on my TI-84 during class That's about it Don't know if that makes me a programmer or not That's kind of cool, Caleb Okay, um Let's start at the beginning of the level So, you want me to make this at level 3 I'm going to make some progress I'm not sure if I'm already doing that I'm going to make some progress I'm going to make some progress So, you want me to make this close, right? How is this supposed to work? Is there like a to-do list or something? It's been so long since I looked at this Pyrite's pretty cool So many people asking me about Pyrite Kind of crazy Yeah, I don't have the to-do list right now One point inside the garden unless going OOB exits the level Gotcha It will not Oh, it has to be inside the thing here I guess we should just Do that Made a to-do list in image form Oh, I see The collision map is still 5000 triangles That is a little surprising to me That's all This is all flat, is it not? This can just be two triangles Or, well, maybe a color model too Let's do it I would like to simplify the collision map just a little bit before we begin here How about that? Go back? I think there's gonna be triangles Wait Did I fuck something up? Oops Yeah, I fucked it up Then I'll just restore the path Crazy to think that the ncf can render all of this True Okay, let me see where the path actually is Oh, okay, I see I see the idea now That step silence is the problem We can save it from here Well, we can simplify it just a little bit Yeah, we can simplify that much The doctor told me that I should not use too many Blender hotkeys because that's probably what caused my hand injuries And now look at me, using Blender like this At Apollo Rust No, every tweeted author has 82.73%, I think we're a lot further than 82.73% I mean, the game's in a state where technically I could just release it right now, basically Well, after bug testing, but still Technically, I don't need to edit any more content now, and we would have a decent game Oh, well then I guess your preview is still useful, it's just not really that useful Okay, do you have the to-do list still? We get this now, and then you just walk forward, and isn't there supposed to be enemies here? On its way, okay Let's start from the start of the level Add everything in the order that it appears Sorry, the collision panicked you Fair enough But don't worry, I fixed it Scarecrow and lawn chomper Let's start with the lawn chomper So this guy is the problem right now with Unlivedragon that I was talking about, just in case someone's curious Currently the way it works is that every new material is like a full 2 microcode switches So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 microcode switches This guy would take like 5% of your entire render budget right now That's the performance problem, the pyrite that I was talking about Let's audit these materials Don't do anything Black primitive color Why are we adding black? Or is this like a dark grey? It's like a value of 0A, that's funny Shell front That just looks fine Gonna love this guy, what did I do? That's fine Lighting! Okay, you can't have lighting, sorry, that's illegal I will recreate your material, kind of I think he wanted something I think it needs to be 2 cycle Hello, am I blind? Primitive? Thank you What part was illegal? Setting light color is illegal Can't do that This is because unlike Mario 64, light color actually is like the color of the light Sounds stupid when I put it like that, but in Mario 64 light color is not the color of the light I think it looked something like this If this is not to your satisfaction, I'll send it back at the end Yeah, again, light color is illegal Just a black primitive here I'm supposed to match the engine and connect still? Okay, so a little more reddish A bit brighter A bit of saturation Kind of like that There we go That's a really cool enemy, I see you don't love me I'm going to cry Okay, looks good Oh, they don't all take lighting That's kind of a problem, I think Well, that's for sure fine Although I think this is a little unnecessary I think for performance reasons, I'm just saying no to this one Wait Nope nope nope, what did I do wrong? Yeah, I closed it off again Or is there more here? It's just a single color, is it not? Right, the face is staying, it's fine, it's just them using a whole texture is a little bad Textures are very expensive I want to know what those perf reasons are, it's 32x32, it's half a T-Month old, it's 16 microseconds The level already has performance issues, so we really have to be a little bit savory with our triangles here Yeah, the triangles are way cheaper than the texture These teeth are very cool Okay, this one also uses lighting, which is illegal This does not use lighting, which would be fine, but isn't Oh, okay, it ran out of vertex colors here, that's fine Also no lighting here I'm guessing this also uses vertex colors I think this one could get away without lighting, I think that would look a lot better Because this way it's going to take the sun we have in the level You okay with that? You think that's better? Because then we actually have the lighting reflect of it Okay, this one also uses lighting, which again is illegal I guess I never really told you that, so that's fair Subtract prim here, have the color roughly be the same Wait, that also sets lighting? Am I completely crazy? What is going on? I need to subtract primitive again, I guess Use shade color alpha Or That should be fine But not multiplying by shade color would look really weird I think we just need to multiply by shade color And then store the actual color in C here is fine Or No, it needs to be like this Wait, what was this multiplying with? Vertex colors? What the hell? Okay, this is a very difficult setup to work with, what the fuck? I think I tinted too much the engine Kinda like so That's too much Let's actually look at what these textures are and if we can do something Where is this used? Oh, these are the screws I see now What are we making? We're working on Marty's side level The engine set the lighting again, oh no Actually multiplying all the primitive colors for the bright light here Okay, this is a difficult one to solve Let's see what you did That's a crazy material But all this for 64x32? Couldn't you just make an RGBA32? Or is this because you want the colors animated? Do you want us to do that? I can finally go into the desert and run about crumbling like France in World War 2 The comedy club saved you, that's funny Okay, we can animate the glow, that's no problem But I do need to find a different way to introduce color Now usually you could just put the environment color here But we can't do that because of our 64x64 limitations I think it might just have to be grey The N64 can handle normal maps pretty easily Just no one's used them yet, that's literally it Sorry, it has to be grey, there's no other way, we just don't have lighting available like that Let's see if the game engine is good I think the engine itself is good, yes Let's go to Biobank Biobank didn't know you can't use light color, that's concerning Oh shit, same thing here But wait, this one's an easy fix This is gonna look even better actually No problem at all Now this looks so tempting, this looks like I can save a triangle here Oh I see, head covers another texture 32x32, how many triangles would it take to just close up the polygons? 5, 10 Honestly I think we should just go for the polygonal version It's cheaper this way I would not make a ROM hack with pirate64, that makes no sense, that's a homebrew thing What if? What the hell, I did something wrong Like this, to make the head a bit rounder That looks weird Nevermind I changed my mind What if we attached the head to the motor like so? Do you think that would look bad? It would save us a few triangles Oh right, he is opening and closing, so that would look bad Yep, good point Yep, that convinced me I think this will be our guide on the important game YouTube doesn't want me to talk about how many Koopas died in the Koopa cast? What? Okay, some issues with that We need the size right? So how big were you envisioning this relative to Mario? I'm thinking Mario is about half of this size here So he would be 300 units in total Gotcha I will do what I feel like then Nintendo wants to partner with me to make an official Mario 64 1.1 version update, I would absolutely be up for it But I have my doubts In fact, if Nintendo asks to partner with me, my first thought would be they are trying to find my address and kill me That would be the first thing going through my mind when I read the email I would sell the Seg for 30 dollars, I wish to it I would be rich afterwards I don't know if this is wisdom I have gathered or just bullshit I'm thinking But I'm thinking listening to music while you work makes you stupid Makes me stupid I stop listening to music while I work, I just work in silence now I feel like this is something we're gonna find out collectively as humanity in like 50 years Nintendo is going to be like, what the hell Are there reasons to avoid working with Nintendo? No Can't find file path Oh Okay well, it's all not set up So let's see if you can have your own music, true Oh, because I didn't make the animation yet So I'll have one idle animation What have I done? How did I mess that up, what? There we go Hello random user, hello Freddy Ferbinardo Oh, image by Marty This has to go, this is done The launch, oh you want the launch jumpers to patrol on a route, okay I'll do that Yes, Nintendo will send an army of attorneys to my house, this is very realistic They will come knocking with swords and shields Okay, so basically Goomba-like but they walk along a spline Okay I don't think 2D image is appropriate for these guys Condition mesh can maybe be approximated Something like that but it will need something at the front as well to actually look any decent So 0, 1, 3, 1 and that was 120 I think 120 A good angle to Mario And then for the radius maybe From Megalomercy to defeat Bowser's lawyers, true And then for the shadow, we need a shadow Oh well we don't need a shadow but we need a random radius That should be 427, roughly the same 20 adds good solidity, actually we need an even higher solidity Okay, we should have something in-game now that hurts you Oh, I forgot about the mill Alright, let's take a look at the chomper in-game Then compile Oh, I forgot this You know once AI gets good enough at video editing, what I'm going to do is I'm going to have it watch every single stream I have ever had And I'm going to have it compile every clip where someone asked for a release date into one long video This is going to be my first 40 hour video and it's just going to be 40 hours of people asking for release dates Okay, I would like that. Actually, we don't want that to be possible, right? We want the player to go through the Yoshis here That's not good then But yeah, you see how the light now actually works with the chomp properly? That's what we wanted The shadow's half the size we wanted Is the release date video coming out? Eh, tomorrow Well, actually I need to program this before we can move on to the next thing He also needs a hitbox at the front Maybe the back should deal 1 damage and the front should deal like 3, I think that would be fair While you're here, check for pro UV skinning, I will do that next time This is going to be a hitbox that only exists at the front For his mouth, radius 100 seems about right Seems to be a bit higher How many volumes does the area render anyway? I think it's like 12,000 10,500 Y, X, Y, Y Which is 163 Thoughts on Suichi's bounty? Don't know anything about it First time I'm hearing of this Hm, only 1 damage It is where the mouth is, but it doesn't do the damage that I wanted it to do But how? What? Okay, I don't get that at all If I change this to a 3, will it do 3 damage on the mouth now? Suichi is giving people $8000 for any to beat any of his world records? Dang, I'm almost tempted to just cheat Make a second account, call it SuichiNator, and just cheat Okay, that's weird Unless the hitbox is programmed to take its parents' damage to a coin value? No, it's not That makes zero sense, what? Am I just wrong on the size of the hitbox? I increased the wrong hitbox size, didn't I? I increased the hitbox size instead of the shadow size Watch Yep That's what happened Now it should work Suichi initially gave $1k, but anyone can contribute Dude, that's the- easiest 8k of my life. I can just cheat and make those $8,000. That is dangerous, man. They need more restrictions. It needs to be something like the run needs to be recorded in front of a live audience, or something. I'm sure they have something, actually. Okay. The hitbox is still not positioned correctly. It shouldn't be this difficult to make a hitbox, but somehow it is. What else could I be missing? I can't use Goombas here. Cool. Okay, we'll just spawn the jump itself as a model. Did you know that's PBR Starcoin in the game? Yes, it is used in this game. Aha, it was a lateral offset instead of the forward. All right, it will work now. You have to tear it in through the edges. Man, through the edges feels like such a fever dream to me. It's like, how is that game real? How did I make that game? Nice, that is what we wanted. All right. Next, time to make some splines of them. Where are they supposed to go? Is there like a guideline or something? We have some here. Wind. Surely we want more than just one, right? Surely we haven't made this entire enemy just for them to be only one. Well, Through the Ages was a game that was made in exchange for pay, and a lot of the levels there I didn't make, so... Obviously, there was less care in it, I guess. I think I'll add one here as well. Or maybe even two. I think I'll add one here as well. Or maybe even two. Time for a spline. We want these to feel mechanical, so the splines will need to be placed in a way where it's like robotics to move along it. Interesting. That feels like a pretty robotic spline. And this is 10,467 triangles according to Blender. 10,466. Oh, that's pretty bad. That's pretty bad. So I'm doing a Nostruno-listed science on OnOff. Hello, hello Biobank. Yeah, my argument is that I decided this today. It was wonderful Ragebait and no one took it, but it is my serious opinion. But I also believe that my serious opinion is Ragebait. See, my serious Ragebait opinion is that I think that music makes us stupid, listening to music while we work. I think boredom is very important. I think it's very important to be bored. And dude, this is the crazy part. You can slot in boredom while you're working if you just don't listen to music. You can do two things at once, work and be bored. That's awesome. Oh my god, we're being so productive by just not listening to music. Did you think about this? Okay, we're just gonna have to hope this looks robotic enough. When bored, you can't do shit. Your brain just keeps distracting you. Skin issue. Brain issue. Yeah, the music in Subway Server is gameplay from my brain in case you focus on the work. Exactly, dude. It is Subway Server gameplay. Okay. I guess at least we agree on the premise, just not on the conclusion. I call this... I don't know. I don't call this fucking anything. I will just get used to no music. Three. Why do I need Subway Server when I have Twitch chat? What is the word? Patrol. I forgot to parent these to the area. So, let me... You're right though that no music makes it more boring. Watching the stream makes me want to be productive to at least feel something. Wait, what? You can listen to your own music on the side, right? Okay, fuck you. Distracts you from work. Is this a song request? Great. Hmm. Hello, XBM. Omg, Spyro the Dragon. No way, it's just Spyro. Fuck it. Fuck it! The fucking double, I don't care. Let me do this. That's what we need. Can you send me the 2 hour OST? No! I like my silence. Don't Grüezi me, I don't speak Bavarian. Use MrFloor, she'll appreciate it. Why does double clicking do this now? Omg, it used to not be like that, I swear. Dude, I'm cooking on the side, then the signs made me forget you were there and you jumpscared me. Bro thought he was just cooking with some yodeling videos on the side. I guess this is my life now, I'm a Yorule watcher. Let's not use opacity because we want to use that for the exhaust. Okay, new object field time. And a new union time. So, they find the closest point once, and then afterwards they just patrol along that line. Monkey comedy club, true. Why are you saying this? Rumble on the things, sure, we can have that. Let's do a super cool hack here in the engine. Now we can translate them, isn't that cool? At least if it is exported correctly we can. Yep, we can now translate that bone. Put it the wrong way around. Okay, I see. Yeah, I enabled that. But I also enabled translation so you can have the whole pipe rotate. Or move rather. Let me check something. Okay, that should work. Wait, why is there a plus one here? Okay, now it should ram around. And I made this fucking mistake again. That's what years of indoctrination does to you. Will there be gas pumping out? Probably not. Maybe. Probably not. Maybe actually. That would be kinda cool. It should probably be there. There are physics I'd like to use that I've already programmed somewhere else. Something like this. So they will relatively quickly stop if they are not aligned with their goal angle. That's good. Rotate. Relatively slow. We can probably speed this up a little bit. 11 units of speed is good. Let's see if it works. Who be pinging me? It is. The UED. Oh no, it's not aligned with the model direction. There's also one of them missing. Okay, so this is a problem. You always have to model Z down, otherwise that happens. And why is one of the two jumps missing? Did I only put one? I only put one. Well, I want to explain why one jump is missing. I didn't only put one. One was just high up in the sky. Which also explains it. We need a physics table. It shouldn't be as bouncy. It's so funny seeing Marty with two different accounts in Twitch chat and YouTube. Okay, that looks very nice and mechanical. They're mowing the lawn! That's pretty cool. I'm liking it. I'm just kind of chilling. Ow, the animation fucked up from me doing that. No problem, I can just remake it because it was garbage anyway. And then this one should probably rhythmically just pop up and down. Yep, they are chain chomp lawn mowers. And then when they spot Mario, they should have an animation and chase Mario until Mario's gone. Oh, I need a raycast for that. That should be in the zoo level. Here, S-Vision. That's not correct. There's an icon. Start. Yes, you can use little peaches for your textures. Okay. Gang, what's your review? With audio stream or without audio stream? Which one do you prefer? I have a feeling people like with music more, so I think I might have to listen to music only while streaming. Music? Okay. I think you are correct that people prefer that too. In that case, I guess I am now open for OST suggestions. A little animation of noticing Mario. Kingdom Hearts 2, alright. I know the biggest Kingdom Hearts fans on the planet. Let's check with them. Okay. Then he starts going. I think it kind of works. Music? That is so Polish sounding. Seneca? No. I don't know that. Okay. Yum yum. And the shake on this one needs to be a little more violent here during this animation. Oh, how did this go away? What? What the fuck? Oh well. I must have accidentally pasted too much. Oh god. That's not a blender issue, that was definitely me fucking up. Okay. Okay. Alright, let's see how this works. There is more that I need to do. Alright. Why do I think my audience is kids? I think only a small percentage of my audience is children. Maybe like 15%? Okay. They don't properly do what I need them to do. You should talk more, the music is kind of boring. Wrong animation for one. Maybe it feels way too slow to me. I don't know why they're so slow. They shouldn't be. Not lunch, but be very fast at least. I know why, I know why, I know why, I know why, I know why. That is true, horrible rules. Water typically should be animated. Okay, that's more like it. Ah! Help! Oh, he can't leave the garden! Okay, that's actually awesome. I like these a lot. Okay, if they catch you here, you're fucked. It's kind of undesired. No, you can't ride them. They just deal 1 damage to you if you jump on them from behind. I see why people would want to ride them though. Riding them looks fun. Maybe I should allow people to ride them. I guess let's do it. Targets. Yes, I think so, Biomech. Alright, now you should be able to ride them. Let's play poopy! It's not really a stealth stage, no. There's one enemy that's kind of like a stealth thing. That's how you ride them. I still need to set the O angle well drawn up. Yep, it's basically all multi, with minor edits. Okay, I think the behavior of them is done. Obviously they still need a VFX and SFX pass for sure. I kind of want to do the level from front to back. Although maybe we should do all the texture animations first. Get some SFX for these and then do texture animations for everything. Oh, that's nice, Marty. I didn't expect it as much, honestly. What's this sound? What's this? I don't want to program that breaking animation, I'm sorry. Alright, let's hear the sound. Okay, that fucking sucks. Let's try that again. I think I like those sounds, except for the elevator sound. Why is that so awful? Are they all this awful? Is elevator free? Okay. Isn't this garbage? Isn't this wrong? But we will try it anyway. Forward is... Minus 276. Y is 271. And then... The left is... But I need to do slow key presses like that, otherwise my wrist is gonna hurt. I'm so old and dead. They should grab Mario like a chug-chug, but that's wrong. Just hold on to him a bit and drive around before dropping him. That's brutal. I write that I would like to see the materials of his body right now a bit, so the shader is more visible. This looks good. Oh, I see. Yeah, that's no problem. Let's brighten him up a little. Well, how do I brighten him up? I don't really have much control to brighten him up. Honestly, I will leave that to you. Sorry, this might be important. That is true, you can't check yourself in-game. Problem is, I don't really know how to brighten this up, other than by editing the textures. The random smoke looks very good to me. Did he just not hit me at all? Okay, he stopped dealing damage, that's a problem. Problem because of that. No, we're not doing that, Squid Kid. Not everything has to be a star, some stuff just has to be content. Okay, cool. I swear you used to be able to double-click things without it marking the whole line. That is so annoying. Let's change that in the latest update. Oh, it's because this is before August. That probably fixes it, maybe? Hopefully? True GD tester. That did damage. It's like in a weird position somewhere. Yeah, it's not where his body is, it's offset somehow. I must have- oh, wait. It's because we rotated the model. It's because the model was rotated wrong. Duh. This should work. The primitive is subtractive. If I brighten them, I make the whole thing darker. And if I darken them, then I lose saturation, so it's not that simple. Brightening them will require a little bit of intelligent thought. I would say the launch jumpers are good now. Okay, what do we need for texture animations? So obviously the water needs to be animated. What kind of water are we working with here? Water, grassy wind, and wooden turbine. Water, grassy wind, and wooden turbine. Wooden tur- this? Lamps? I am confused. I'm sure I'll find out in a bit. Wind would be an animation, gotcha. Okay, I can tell, to make that work, we probably want this at 60fps. So we're not going to use Fast64's built-in animations. The wind is going to be... Oh, that's nice. That's gotta be so cool. Those are color index animations. Okay, I'll be honest, I don't think we can do this all today. I think next time we work on this level, which is probably next stream, we'll do all the texture animations. And probably the scarecrow, or whatever else comes first on the level. But yeah, I think we will finish this level over the next few streams. I will be working on the next side level off-stream, probably. Yeah, I will be going offline for now, and I'll see you guys next week.
