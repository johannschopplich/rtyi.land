It in and I hope we can go a whole stream without people asking me for release dates every 15 minutes that would be pretty nice it looks like Donkey Kong's house wait yeah honestly it has that vibe dude Donkey Kong would totally have a squat rack in his house he's a monkey he's gonna train for the next king kong rule boss fight or whatever Donkey Kong is up to I don't know I don't play Donkey Kong what OST do we pick for today okay and where did we leave off I think we were programming all the platforms here right I just made this one here and now I need to program it this one should be pretty easy to program I think I'll program it as an object just so now she and everything works right off the bat I think I'm listening to the Ocarina of Time OST because I want to use this OST in my new video out my way I mean that just seems like a fun goofy name no issue with that hello Selden not some surprise you are here mr. comet great to see you I am gonna continue monstrous manner I think tomorrow hopefully if I have time I'm not a fan of the textures of this at all but let's see I think I'm really close to the end already actually I guess yeah six hours is a pretty long playtime for a moment hello Hydra I am NOT remastering OOT no unless that was decent financial incentive to do so but there just isn't I cannot justify full-time hacking OOT like it doesn't work did someone just call me true when's the release date the stream should not be buffering hello creep attack yeah time to export this yes in a new location I actually recently moved I don't know if you know about this and now I'm in a new location hello hello hello hello hello hello so I'm working on a video on the Indra square root I think it might do okay on YouTube I honestly have no idea what people want anymore I don't know what that's not what I copied yeah Zeina is finally out of my hair she is upstairs now and I'm downstairs isn't that nice we have an upstairs unbelievable her number five on trending I feel like a lot of programmers watch my channel now and not so much the casual audience ever since the source code revert so now what's popular is like the technical stuff and not the baby easy simple stuff but I am still planning on a one-hour video essay on ground water more 64 actually now you should not be looking forward to a one-hour video essay on that it's gonna be terrible it's gonna be just like the grass video I'm gonna spend 10 minutes just talking about video game water I'm just gonna talk about like different styles of video game water you will learn way too much about video game water April 1st is just my excuse to shitpost that's what it's devolved to I did not mean to open that I found some nice mini optimizations over the week to some ways to remove a few more functions like this in line them we're slowly getting to a point where I no longer know any more optimizations which is crazy isn't it so see every time that is true but like this time I know more than last time so the remaining optimizations have to be small I would like to do ot next but I need financial incentive I can't just do it it would be irresponsible honestly having done it once like why would I want to do it again wait what's going wrong oh it's your scrotum zeros missing big optimizations I can make no only very small ones hello Sinai this new house was already there last week wasn't it because it is a basement I'm a basement dweller now do you think there are insults out there complaining that I'm appropriating the basement while alive fix out yeah true I'm a fixer maybe looking into combining stream music elements with sequence music to get them in storage yep I have played a large chunk of Mario RPG but I quit eventually because it got grindy or something I don't remember good morning Lilaa welcome to the fake cell stream I wasn't streaming earlier so much a nice room and then he said fake salad sinks a lot of the video I died it should be this comment here I'll be Jay undeclared how I don't think Zeina would be playing candy crush I'm more of a cold cell than a think so what the fuck are these words what is the thing selling a cold cell missing one thing before we can compile and look at our elevator and that is the declaration do you think generating items from an SVG and runtime could be reasonable that depends on how complex your level is I think it's doable but it is going to take about a good amount of resources I think hello Clayman I don't see your headache interesting oh I see I was returning that doesn't fit into the texture cache Lilaa I thought you of all people knew how texture cash worked can't believe he would do this to me okay so now with the oh I don't think my grandparents did anything at all like what the fuck when my grandparents doing all day you know what I mean you ever think about someone and you're like there's no way in fuck this person has a life at all like if I'm not interacting with them they're inactive they don't exist they're like an actual NPC an animal crossing to me but if all people just gossip all day that's that's not a good life to have but like my grandparents they lived alone on a hill with two people and no one else around who could they possibly have gossiped about why is this not moving Mario and absolutely should be what the hell I did hit compile did I not this area is very early oh and this is for the transitions leader I see yeah that honestly seems reasonable dude what's going on what's the conductors level this is the power plant area from the oil level so if you go inside the whole power generator gonna have to platform through it and eventually you get to the wall but later if they take too much time to like actually compute out then I can't have them in I mean if you wanted to compress them into SVGs and then uncompressed them at runtime yeah I'm because I do need more RAM savings for like second I work can just do one every other frame I don't wanna I think it's gonna be expensive Lilaa there's some subtle hint you can put into the radioactive plant boss battle and treat alone to imply that the reach mirror is from this level that is a funny idea I mean we could just put a bozo symbol on it but I mean it's not from this level like that's not the cannon here your grandfather was a you might have thought my grandfather actually no my grandfather was like seven in World War two okay considering what's going on here what happens if I just did this there's no way that this shouldn't affect Morris velocity unless I broke platform displacement entirely let me see if that's true if this doesn't work honestly that's the only explanation I must have broken platform displacement entirely it works here what about things that move the velocity all right daylight savings in Europe early no platform platform displacement works so why the fuck does my elevator not work oh what if what if right there were two of the exact same platform in the exact same spot overlapping each other and that's why it didn't work animated transitions Okay, now you're crazy talking Lilaa That happened so much it's usually the first time that happened, isn't it? I don't think i've ever made that mistake before Okay, Lila, I believe you that this feature may work but I don't see how oh I also forgot to give it collision Okay now for real I'm using the tick function. I am I think that banning slurs is silly Let the children swear Wait, no, no, not slurs swears swears guys. I meant swears guys. I meant swears. I meant to say swears Oh no Ah Oh no Oh Oh my god, it's over it absolutely is It's the monster's mana treadmill dude, I was gonna make that joke I was gonna finish it and then say to come and look from it. This is how you make a treadmill See you guys in a downfall of keys Mario's moving a little fast. I need to slow down a bit. Oh shit. Thanks. I couldn't tell it's not like that's exactly what I was working on  Okay, it's going slightly faster I Think you say will be held against young cards true I Know it's vibrating and that's because this is actually animated at 30 fps, but it was animated at any higher fps It would Also be twice as fast All right. I think this works now She's cut out for transitions instead of textures You mean like polygonal cutouts So The problem with using polygonal cutouts instead of textures is that you can't really get the smooth edges Unless you also use like vertex alpha on them Which I guess that could look pretty good. Yeah Mario did you end up um picking any textures for this because otherwise I might have to try some more What if no smooth edges just like sharp I think that would look very new mush That would kind of look like the star revenge polygonal cutouts on the floor And I really don't like those Dude did you guys see the performance improvement last week? Look at this This was in the last week or so We went from 43 to 45 fps to the range of 45 to 49 fps And then I fixed some culling thing and now the fps are down to 47 again, but still I'm gonna just pick random textures. I'll change them when I rework the level So That's kind of really difficult for me because I can't really estimate the vibe of this, you know i'm kind of When I design a level I kind of have to go with the vibe But i'll just try that if you say that's fine I will give it a try So You should make an entire level about making a math umpire Oh, I see i'll just pick something that fits the vibe Um Oh You get the reference one reference Oh breaking bad I am losing officially I Access the normal access I'm not raining Z is forward in blender So the Z normal axis is the axis that the face is facing You How do you make music and it's not fun to elect to make the lowest team in my six or something I think it's not good. You can use Fuck the sex 64 seq 64 and it will let you do that And I guess this whole area is gonna be ugly until Biobak gets to it just because I Can't really change many things right now Without knowing the exact textures This will be in the game Yeah fair Mario never had that energy that is actually factual And yeah, let's not do SVGs and rum let's door compressed on polygonal transactions So it don't start UV. Thanks. I need to know what's what we do start off for smooth So You wanna store a polygonal cutouts and use the transparent layer to run that is that the idea I'm getting here I Don't know what the end goal is I mean you want to render out the texture from that you want to render this overhead thing? I think both could work honestly I Don't think text that will ever look good or maybe maybe text that will look good I'm not sure 50 50 on it Case are you able to tell what you worked on at years for breakfast? They haven't announced anything in a while and I expect new things. I Am NOT allowed to tell what I am working on. I'm still actively working there. I Also don't know what the company would like me to respond to questions like that What's the official HR community manager response here I Don't even know if I'm allowed to say that we are working on a game maybe we're not I Working on DLCs, maybe we're just sitting around and doing nothing HR says just say the name of the game. Oh, thank you HR Yeah, I was hired in GFB We are working on a competitor to win, right so true We're gonna make win zip oh You own it Lilaa I thought that was still Jonas I have never recreated any of my levels. Maybe that would be a funny idea Did I force you to eat yes for breakfast as part of the company policy Mm-hmm But they say I shouldn't say that publicly They don't want to get in trouble with the Twitter crowd over forcing people to eat gears Of course you can beat Morris's over the guitar hero controller, it's not even difficult I Dude we made it 30 minutes into the stream and no one's asked for a release stand yet. What a blissful day. This has been Oh Okay, I thought that as soon as I say that everyone else for the release date so creative guys Sorry, I was being a big I Did I'm actually so glad that in that and dude video or whoever the guy was they credited me as the author of Mario Party 64 just because of The whole credit thing just because like people were like case you didn't credit correctly now people gonna think you made it Well, I had nothing to do with Mario Party 64 and people still thought it What can I do? This is like clear proof. It is not my own fault The girl from tinder I kidnapped and keep in my basement, please think You Case that's a bit petty. So what I don't care Honestly, I don't think it's petty I think if I actually worked for it that would have been patty but it just happened It was just a beautiful coincidence of nature I We also found out why the coins were rendering weird and I fixed it It was just a small miscomputation Case your platforms are overlapping. I think you should fix that. Okay Lilaa I Have one in my chest it's worse than that Oh The 4,000 polygon treadmill curve it's not 4,000 it's 44. Come on Yes The models are all invisible blender because they're objects they're spawned by the game There's no way for planet to know what's happening in my game That's all memos of gizmos to work from home or did it finally get an office since they don't have time from home No, we're still all in the home office Oh, this is a problem True the bunny force robots. They don't make for very good platforms Okay, this is weird because This shouldn't have worked at all and yet somehow it kind of did Because I forgot to do a thing I Need to actually turn this off Yet somehow it kind of worked and it really really really shouldn't Wait No, it's not an animated material what the fuck so weird I Never do runtime code changes to optimize your game. Yes. I have no qualms about run time code changes actually the first game or the second game in which I really assembly code it which was Maurice holiday, I think it's what it was called had runtime code changes I had self-modifying assembly code Because I figured hey, this is actually a faster way to program this. I Wanted to change the axis on which an object moves so I just changed the assembly code and run time to change the axis of points to And then ran the same assembly code Because Megan then you had to write every line of assembly code into lemme SM one by one I Don't see how this is scrolling on the y-axis at all. This is actually a huge problem I'm on 3.4 This really shouldn't be scrolling yet and thus there's some bug going on. Let's stop scrolling cool I'm Pretty sure there's a fast 64 and texture scroll comment that is just breaking this Send you a new emote on this court. Oh That would be a good one, but I don't know how to add him. Wait, can we add emotes here? I'll get emotes to YouTube chat if I knew I would do it Yeah, look at this there's a text scroll here, huh Hey, I Removed it Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Nope. I didn't It's still here How is there a texture scroll here I literally removed it I Think I need to make clean But it also means that this is just two point one two five and not two point five The name of the file was crossed out The name of the file was crossed out. Oh, oh cool. That's good I Mean because here today we're overlapping No, that was just a different action that I hadn't selected that was doing the scrolling. I think the velocity is going to be wrong now But in a good way because this should be a lot slower now Hmm Interesting That Means we can make the 60fps, which is good When you think Mario's movement state machine is a strip they're not on enum It's a struct You're talking about Good morning case or should I say case? I think both is fine Hmm No, did I put this on the wrong layer Nope layer four I Mean that would be really cool. Which one? I Should turn more sunshine into an in 64 game. I think it can be done Because that would be like the ultimate just like destruction Right now that we have this per frame we can turn this up to 4.25 again. I Think I'm just gonna turn Delfino Plaza into an n64 level Just to prove it can be done, but I'm never actually gonna go through with it There was a DS remake of Mario Sunshine going on to That could have been really cool But I think they ran into The romega fate which is you don't finish your game When are you done to make like X of everything but good where it runs 60 and a rear to be pretty free cloud Just set me up That would be really good free cloud Honestly before our tyi's release. I do want to release one or two more demos where people can just Play test the physics and stuff so we should do that, but it's gonna be like The the most popular famous known levels for Mario 64. I Was gonna do that was once fathers were not as forms for just But I ended up being too busy to do it and people didn't even really like it that much So it's kind of polygonally inefficient. So a Now why does my set tile size not scroll do I need to modify the third argument or not the second that must be it I Not enough contrast that's always the problem I See oh Here we go A nice beautiful 60fps animation So the idea is that you go on here and you just jump forward like that and then there would be more platforms there And then here it's just a slidy time Okay, that's a huge problem actually that never should happen And then the final room here with some platforming and I'm at the star I Wasn't doing random things. I was just Actually, and the argument for the scrolling was random. Oh I know why though because this is the tile and this is why and this is X or S&T I Doing more small topical simulation acts like only up 60 would be fun Yeah, see the thing is I do want to release more hacks before I release our toy I just to get the camera and the physics just right because when I released only up 64 I released issues with the camera I noticed issues with the side flip and I feel like I want to release at least one egg where it's like this is all perfect And then I put our tyi out because once I have our tyi out I can't really change anything anymore that much But I also don't want to work on hacks that are not gonna be a financial success So we do have to find something topical or something clickbaity like Mario 64 level but good Dangling platforms. Oh, we wanted dangling platforms here Okay, this is gonna be a bit of a problem because the treadmill shoots you so far forward. I think I do need Something coming out of the wall like this where you can just land What is an OTA update I Think I want to see how I went on one of us just activates chaos bars. Of course would be fun Yeah, I mean, I think that could work for you guys, but like I Really don't want to put in all that work on making the wonderflowers and stuff And I just don't think it'd be a very cool idea. That's also one thing That I somewhat value like the fact that I should be liking the idea making at least somewhat You Yeah, Zeina's in a different room now she's upstairs and I'm downstairs she said I am never allowed to come upstairs And then she punched me And then she said she would lie about this on stream and gaslight you guys Oh When you just come rushing down if I ever go to the toilet to draw an MS paint You Did I think I found the perfect way to script my videos from now on look at this It's a five-step act first. We hook in the viewer By saying some ridiculous out-of-pocket shit right here. It's gonna be like yeah the fast in West Garret is not even good You know, we're gonna say something like that Then second We're gonna start building tension. We're gonna be like look this is devastating There's no way our hero can win this battle. We're gonna be like, yeah, this is why it's bad And this is why it's bad and this is why it's bad We're gonna make it sound completely hopeless and then at the height of tension just like a normal free act story We're gonna be at the climax and we're gonna be like actually There's this one use case. This is the one time where you can actually use the inner square That's a really good year And then we have our epilogue here where we talk about more improvements to the fast and with square roots and how much it saves Now I just gotta pick music to properly accompany this and I think I'm gonna go with the ocarina of time OST There's six steps not five that's fine That's the fast and with square root get the girl in the end it does And I'm thinking of going with ocarina of time music here There is a decent likelihood that Luigi is going to be playable Do you guys hear the heater turn on too much in the background or is it kind of not bothering you Yeah, a lot of video essays do just sound like chat GPT Which is exactly why I had chat GPT get mine for April fools The Plants versus zombies OST that doesn't sound like it could build tension and all the things I need Wait, how much that I extend this it should be 500 I think it is 500 But this is way too close this is just seven recordings away I Can't reminded you of summoning salt. I don't really watch a lot of summoning salt No, it does go out out after a while that's just we have a stupid oily pump so it like turns on and off all the time We Just caught the biggest cheetah in speedrunning He was pretending to be blindfolded, but if you look closely you can see that he's actually looking at the screen Isn't this so outrageous what huge news let's talk about this for 30 minutes I Don't know I just saw the cheetah video that they made and The guy who cheated I don't think he was even trying to hide that he was cheating and it was pretty obvious Did something's going really weird with my waltz in this level, I don't know why it's just here The Blindfulness mistakes for guy. Yeah It was blatantly obvious that he was cheating and the stream had like five viewers and No one would ever have believed them and the video went on for so long. It was like, okay, who the fuck cares? No one watched this guy. No one accepted his run. No one believed him for a second. Why are you talking about this? He had five viewers You know, I mean You might as well make a 15-minute documentary about your toddler playing with Legos that is just as relevant Timmy was misbehaving in playtime. Let's talk about this for 30 minutes Is this maybe not perfectly aligned it is fuck You watch that video yeah, if you watch the video you would think that this was a much bigger deal than it actually was the reality is No one cared ever We Do need Yoshi coins in here, I just realized so bar on mission one scaffolds Somewhere in the water huge part regular locks is a coin and if you dig deep and this has to be in the power plant I Better and so part of water. Yeah, so I'm actually thinking we should have a bunch of breakable blocks here like the Mario Party minigame and Then you just break all of them and there's a Yoshi coin inside Seems like the guy kept doubling down on the light on I Mean, maybe he kept saying yeah, but like no one would ever believe it I That first glance at Timmy appears to follow the Lego set instructions perfectly But if you slow down the footage of the tick-tock is on recorded in his birthday, you'll notice something is off I Yeah, fuck it I guess this is the gold and I level Mmm destructible blocks, how do we make them look? How do we properly convey that they are destructible? I mean, how did that not work? No, I see You Are we really gonna make the player use these to get up there? That seems a little brutal. I think I'm gonna make something easier so that they can use wall kicks here to get up. Like you pull one down and then you wall kick onto the other one. That should be difficult enough. How would I have caught this far? There we go. Weight elevator. They're super rusty. I don't think that conveys destructibility very well. I think this might work. I mean, we can have them just be cracked metal barrels. But this is the power plant. There surely is something we can do power plant-wise that will work here. You know what, I don't want this. I want this to be three pipes going down, not just the platform. I think this would look cooler if this was just a bunch of pipes. 900, so they have to be 300 coordinates actually. Maybe the blocks have surf acid coming out of the cracks? I still don't know what that is There are server that can patch ROMs army and isn't parallel launcher you can use any IPS patcher or BPS patcher You can even use hack 64 they have a thing online Where you can just patch your game I I See why you wouldn't want to use parallel launcher. I hate the software to Fuck parallel launcher every time you open it up. There's like 15 updates Guys if I open parallel launcher, how many updates do you think there will be just give me a guess How many times do I have to press the update button I Hundred fifteen six hundred sixty-six. Okay, you know when you guys guesses are also ridiculously high you're ruining my job To I Think like five or six is realistic. Let's open parallel launcher One two three only three Although we don't know how many that would have been an impressed. Yes, maybe that would have been more I Case make it so I can send links. How Said 15 cuz you said it. Oh fair. I Don't know well, I don't know either Lilaa you're gonna have to live this life I Know it doesn't matter how many times you open the software. This is like every time Even when I was actually trying to use it actively it kept happening Honestly You should see this as an advertisement for parallel launcher because I'm sure you guys like updates unlike me. I Just want the thing that works and then it works forever Case you like to me. You're the one who recommended to me Well, it is the easiest option and probably also the best because everyone's developing on it now I'm just a boomer that uses project 64. I Would emulate this as a service Oh Like a subscription service that you pay for every month. Yeah I think that's already existing. It's called Nintendo online That's honestly exactly what I said to Rosetta I said the parallel launcher will never become the standard forever because it is attached to retroarch So if you use the stuff that is exclusive to parallel launcher your hack will get outdated eventually Lilaa send a link. What is this? Oh That looks mostly fine, I mean I can tell some oddities like here You can definitely tell that some of it is holy go nice I Think this needs another subdivision Or two How can I okay, well I guess I have to make Lilaa a mod I Guess you can post links now Anything will offer on in front of this is fine possibly I Have no idea what all graveness What does it stand for I will use my powers, thank you. Oh shit Well fellas we live in an e-girl dictatorship now It was nice knowing you 1984 is about to begin Case expects about me. I'm awesome faults You 1984 was 84 years ago case damn time really goes faster when you're having fun Since 64 fucking sucks It's like an n64 but worse I tried to use at once because missing link was crashing on n64 and I thought they could save time and NC and send 64 didn't emulate the crash correctly So I couldn't actually use it and at that point like I went for all this effort Try and use this emulator. That's supposed to be super accurate and it's not accurate You They don't actually know what year it is, huh Do you think the mindset that the people in 1984 the book had could actually ever exist in real life Where they go that whatever the government says is true and I will live a still it was my truth Do you think people are capable of that that mindset I Was that book just making shit up I Guess I'm 64 could easily run on the ps1. What do you mean? Look at something like spiral. That's Graphically a lot more demanding than my 64, isn't it? Why wouldn't Mario 64 run on it? But only we were able to keep the thoughts of his own bullshit doctor had completely survived. Oh I see Wait, so do you basically selectively breed people for obedience So you just get more and more obedient people every generation. Is that the idea? It's the book about eugenics You It's got nothing to do by me being German, I think that's a perfectly normal thought At Uni and a level ask me anything. Well, I just lost your question. You didn't answer it But that is a logical takeaway I see I hope all of you guys know the remix of the song If not, I have bad news for you guys I might listen to it You it's not well might not be what it's about but it might actually just above that, you know My game is not estimating as a game you game simply for the fact that I'm rendering at a much lower resolution The Polygon count sure it is a game keep game in many aspects I Show you the new music for the first temple It It's beautiful What does this message mean be Turk I'm trying to understand what you're trying to tell me with that Like doesn't matter whether you spell it doesn't let us or the word They're definitely gonna put our team I I onto actual and 64 cards I Say anything bunny first warm-ups I just thought it'd be really funny if my course one had a lunch of level warm-ups that I'll lead to here The director book isn't 1984. Hey, then what is it? You just said it's 1984 Are you saying it's not 1984 I think what are you doing? I Think this is way too difficult. We can't ever be like that I Wouldn't just say it was my name for a bit easier. Hey Hey, I Am so comfy what the fuck are you guys talking about? Shouldn't games good difficult as you go forever. That is also true I'm just trying to see like how bad can you really play this game before you're running into trouble? The problem here is that the camera also kind of sucks, right? I don't like that. You can't see Mario If you were able to see Mario correctly during this I wouldn't mind this at all. I think Of Hon hon, yo, hon, Joe, I'm sure you're pronouncing a hon. Yo Okay, that's because hon. Yo It's you pronounce it like that in German and I think you also pronounce it like that in Japanese I think you're pronouncing it wrong if you say hon. Joe Of course I can add Mario outlines My game is actually the first one and have that Because I I took the code from frame and turned it into C code or turn it into assembly. I don't remember Tony's always felt exactly as it's about yes But the J sound is different in German and probably also in Japanese from a harness in English Yeah, I already put a shadow of Mario behind walls and Mario party 64 That was me This has to be different Let's move it over here And Then we can have to be another row of pipes here You Maybe just one pipe you land on that and then you land over there. Let's see if that works If you just make the walls a little more nuts and give them camera collision That is how the level works, but this is a platform in the middle of the level So we can't do that Why don't you just turn the camera collision on on those I Can but I would also have to increase the camera distance on that and would still be weird I don't want the camera colliding anywhere Also, no, that's not how camera collision works in this game Look camera collision automatically doesn't do anything if it's in middle of the level Only when you actually go into a wall does it do anything because we don't want the camera to zoom in on every fucking fence I don't wanna why are you guys making these stupid suggestions? Why don't I just move the platforms out of the way? What is this? Already not a solution I Think that works You Don't like landing on ledges. Well, this is fine because this is a climbable one. So you won't slide off You So likely likely On here and then do a side flip and a jump. I think I might want to reduce how quickly these snap back just to make that jump a bit easier. Didn't they remove the chanting in the US version? It does sound like they're doing it. How does the Mario bounciness work? What is the Mario bounciness? Mario's not bouncing at all. Look. He cannot wall jump on the pipes now. Oh, this caution stretch. Whenever Mario's absolute value changes, you receive some bounce velocity either up or down. When Mario's velocity goes away from zero, he squishes a bit and when it goes towards zero, he elongates a bit. So like if I fall, it will get longer and then get short as soon as he lands. And when I jump, he goes long again. I actually did rework this recently and I think it looks a lot better now. What do you think? Why aren't you doing a Mario 64 Beyond the course barrel playthrough? I tried, but I got eight stars in and then I hated the game and I just quit. So I didn't upload that because that would have been very depressing to watch. What if you have boxes you have to punch multiple times for them to destroy, like you punch it once and there's a crack, you punch it again, there's a bigger crack. Like that. We need to think about this part now. We're already halfway done with the power plant here. Like we have this section, this section, and two sections remain. Well, actually three if you count the slide. BTCM had boxes like that, but no indication there were damage when you hit that once. Yeah, that. See, that. Yeah. I don't like that. You barely started, how does that give you enough to tell if you hated or loved it? Well, if it was really boring, then I'm confident in saying that I don't want to continue playing. How much do you think eight stars is? It's like almost an hour already. See, my experience with the game was like, oh, I'm in the vanilla castle, let's get on top. And then there was this speedrunner entrance and I was like, okay, well, I guess I'm just gonna go in here and see what this is. And then I skipped basically half the story already. And then I just kinda, I think I was in the lava level, the Jurassic level. I think I fought the boss once. Some energy pistons. Yeah, we're gonna have all of that. We, right now, are just thinking about, you know, what we have here is that we need boxes we can destroy so we can hide a Yoshi coin underneath it. No, I wanted to see what's in there. I don't know if it said speedrunner hall, but I told Robert about the hall and he said, oh yeah, that's a speedrunner hall, something like that. They crank, okay, wait, fireland blocks. Let's see how they look like. Oh, they look stupid. The only one speedrunner I could never get into. Damn, that's devastating. Is this, this looks like Counter-Strike or Fortnite. Shouldn't be crates like this. Barrels, because this is an oil power plant, right? It could be barrels, but I don't want Mario to destroy barrels. It says rust on the image. Where? Not that it matters, but what the fuck? Comically large batteries. We don't want Mario destroying batteries. Maybe that's like a storage room in a power plant. Are the other pictures? Okay, the other pictures, yes. Why not just batteries explode or something? And they're also not really known to be breakable. But it's all overrun with vegetation because it's a power plant. I don't think that an oil plant in the middle of the ocean would really have that many plants, right? Almost because spilled slippery oil would destroy it. I don't know if I want that, really. I think I just want normal crates here. Oil drum. What is that? It's just a barrel. Why is it called drum? But no, it needs to look breakable. I want the plant to break a bunch of shit here, just because it would be really fun. Grantee industries. Yes, that is a good idea. I remember this level. I worked on this with UAD. Have you guys heard that Sega is making a new game where they spent a lot of money on it? I don't know if it's real. I just kind of heard that. Dude, I want a choo-choo train in this game. Ah, it's like this. That doesn't look too breakable to me, though. The Wild West. Ah, shit. That's a cool idea. The Wild World level needs one. Yes. This level needs to have a train where Mario plays detective inside. It'd be too cool. It's just way too cool. I want a train and you're playing detective and then you're having a boss fight on top of the train roof. That'd just be too cool. They're making a super game. Wild Guy Gulch. TTYD did it. It's fine. I can do it, too. You know what, I hadn't timed it as well. Now that I think about it. It's not going to be a train level. It's a Wild West level. Why would I add six birds? I don't understand this reference. Here's another attempt. Oh, wait. There we go, YouTube. Yeah, that's a lot smoother. That might work. I am not sure. You guys think this looks good? I think this looks kind of bad. Okay, if we look at the shot. I don't know, man. The fence looks so weak. The colors are random almost. This one seems so bright and it's not lit by the rest of the scene. It's surprising. I thought Banjo-Tooie games always looked kind of bad. The box is marked as fragile or breakable. I see. That makes sense. I'm starting to think, do I even want breakable crates? What else can we put that's breakable? Should we substitute this with another Yoshi coin? I don't think Yoshi coin can be put here. We should definitely put a shit ton of barrels in here. There's gonna be amp enemies in here. Yeah, maybe it'd be cool to have more types of amps like the other Mario games have it. That move around inside poles and stuff or inside the ground because everything's electric. Everything here should be electric. Maybe we can do something with that. Hmm. It could also be a little puzzle where you turn on a light or something. Oh yeah, that's the thing I want here too. This whole area should have pretty dynamic lighting. I wanted to make it so that enemies that have lighting effects move through here and all the vertices around it light up. So I will make a bunch of lightning enemies. I wonder if we can use that for the Yoshi coin instead. We can just put barrels everywhere around here like it's no big deal. I'm gonna put power generators around here. There's gonna be amps going through here. There should also be amps going around the pipes here. Maybe these pipes should be clear. Oh, maybe not. There will be gates here with amps going through. Gates here. There's the trap melts here. More stuff here. There will be amps going through this here. This will be the whole amp section. Yeah, just like we're gonna redo the amps. The amps on R64, I don't think they are viable. We're gonna make them look kind of like Mario Odyssey, I think. They need to be a lot lighter. Give me two secs. Okay, you already made some. If we do have a Yoshi coin, it should be in the first area though and I think we need one. Get up! Plant or plant one? Let's see what will I make. Let's see if this is true or rubbish. This is rubbish. Why'd you do this, Lilaa? Why would you do this to me? I don't have to tech chest. Yep, I do not. Oh, you fixed the GeoLeon? I want to make completely new amps anyway. I can't do anything with a fixed vanilla one. Yes, pack your data. Let me pull up the references for my interior. This is what I want this to look like. And this. And this. I guess this is all from Pokémon. Can we use any of this as inspiration for something to use for the Yoshi coin? I like the letters too. The letters are kind of cool. But I don't think we can realistically use the letters well on Mario 64. Anything a little breakable? Oh, we could totally have a dangling platform. Like a platform that's somewhere out and then you ground pound it and the platform just falls and that somehow helps you get a coin. Hmm. Wait a second, wait a second. I have a cool idea. I have a really cool idea. Let me see how this works. So imagine a Yoshi coin like somewhere up here and there's no way to reach it. Like you could try and reach it like that, you wouldn't get to it. And the only way to get it would be to pull this platform down and then like hit it something like that. I think that would be really cool. I'm gonna have to make this one go down a bit further, but it should work. I think that's the play. Turbine halts. Let me see what that is. I am not quite sure what a turbine hall is. I don't see anything of reference there. Then chain near the death bar and when you stand on a platform it pulls the coin up. That kind of works too. The thing is I want the Yoshi coin to be in the first room here. So let's do that. That you don't have to do half the star again if you miss the Yoshi coin. It's kind of sucky you have to do that jump to get there. Ideally you would be able to just do a long jump. Oh you can do a long jump but you have to space it really well. Let me make it easier to space it. I think it's fine here because if we put geometry down here like generators and stuff, oil barrels, it will look more natural. But like it's true it's 8 bytes. All real displace comments are 8 bytes. They're just some fake ones that are macros to do more than one thing. Yeah that works for the Yoshi coin. Just gonna put some stuff below it. This is not the spirit temple song. This is also not the potion shop is it? Is there even a potion shop? Water temple. All right. That sucks that you can do that. I don't like that. I don't want the player to be able to do that. Just no. Now what do we put under there? They're gonna jump to obscure platform under this floor. Same height but would feel better to find. They're gonna jump to obscure platform under the slopes. You mean from here over there? You can do that if you want. We can have it be closer to the platform. The thing is I want there to be something else down here that you can then stand on. Like a generator. Let me finish this first and then you can tell me what you think. I'm gonna have something kind of like this in there. You know what I don't need the whole thing. I can just make one here. Could just put a platform to prevent the number of the entire corner be accessible. Now we don't have to do anything like that. So do This is a power generator after all so it makes sense that there's that thing. Polygonal shadows. Like instead of a texture you want to use vertex alpha. That's a tough call actually. I've been told a triangle is b0 bytes so like for a shadow. I guess for a square shadow it could work. For a square shadow you'd have two four six eight ten triangles. Which is what is a multiplied by b0? Like something like seven zero zero. I guess it could kind of work. Oh well now you can just do that. I don't want that to happen. I don't want players to just do that. Wait what will you replace them with Biobak? Nothing they don't look good. Oh damn. I didn't realize. Put some railings on the ramps. That doesn't help. Or I can just jump over them. The only real fix is to make the thing smaller. 0x600. Dude I was so close by saying seven zero zero. Holy shit. Is that what I said? Should be SVG at load time to save some room space or compress text just normally. SVG at load time is extremely over engineered. And it is going to save you just a few bytes of memory. But it is technically an optimization. So I'm on board with it. They look good but they fuck up the geo and objects aren't affected so they look off. Yeah yeah. I see what you mean. It's not just a few bytes. We have circle transition, bowser transition, nori transition and star transition. So four of them. Altogether is 16 kilobytes. And you said one SVG text was 1.4 kilobytes. So it's 5.6 kilobytes plus the algorithm to decode SVGs. I'm guessing you save 9 kilobytes of room space. And like 70% compression. That's like 1.5 kilobytes what you save. Yeah I mean you are free to do it but I think you're gonna save like 1.5 kilobytes overall. So how much does that really help? I mean it's not nothing but it's very close to nothing. Well if you do remove the polygonal channels I guess it frees up some performance in the level. That level is a bit rough performance wise. Yeah this easily works. I held back a little bit but it's fine. You don't reach 50 FPS yet? I have but you can still if you're like in widescreen modes or maybe with anti-aliasing. You know. The camera on that can be pretty rough. I mean there are romhacks with every level being a full level which I think that's like it's 26 areas in total. I think Mario just slides too fast on this. Can I make this just slippery to make him go slower? So I want to make some enemies next. How do the M Mario sunshine look like? Did I always look like this? It just kind of looks bad. Oh my god this is fucking rough looking. They absolutely need to glow. I'm reworking them yeah. Make them look like Odyssey's wild transformation. That was my first thought as well. I actually thought that was an imp. They are not in Mario Odyssey. So  How do you make an effect like that? Is it just a spiky texture that's scaling up disappearing and then a new one? We can probably do that. If we have. So these amps are going to be moving. So what if we make the gray ball and then we also add like a polygonal thing pyramid that goes outwards. With a texture that is put with a random text shift offset and the random roll rotation. When we can scale up disappear and then the next one and we do that over oil fuzzy. Oh no wait that's a really cool idea. Oh I like that. I think I like that a lot. What would it do to you? I guess I would let you send a link John but somehow YouTube deletes them. Maybe you can send it on my discord. No I definitely want these fuzzies. I think there's some pretty easy ways to program an asset trip. So Hmm. Let's try experiment with some asset trip visuals. That gives everything in the room a rainbow oil texture. But it makes a fucked up version of the music that seamlessly blends in. That would be really difficult. But I can fuck the music up in runtime with like pitch bends and stuff. Reverse controls. Nah. Dude why doesn't this work? What the hell? Is this not what a matrix is? Do I have to do this? That's really weird. Okay. I already did the asset trip there but it worked very differently. So we can't really apply that here. Okay. That looks fucking weird. But that's not what I want. Why did it do that? Why is it like this? It shouldn't be. Okay. It might be the stupid GCC bug again. Nope. Maybe it's not. Okay. Why is it like this? I think this idea has potential but it's just not doing it right. Alright. This is more like it. Okay. Maybe not like that. I don't know what the best matrix element is to mess with. Yes! We moved. This is the new place.  I see some slide changes from doing that. I'm sure there's one element in the perspective matrix where if we mess with it, it will look just right Well, this is definitely disorienting I didn't realize it could do that. That's cool Dude why does it take so long to open? Oh fuck This definitely feels very not good This would be an epic effect for chaos Dude why does my emulator take so long to open now? Actual misery So Nah, there's no way I can do that easily by a mic What about these motherfuckers Fizzle it They're nice, but I prefer the old school enemies that were already in Yoshi's Island That's one reason I like the fuzzy idea so much because it is already in Yoshi's Island And this mod is Return to Yoshi's Island after all So Man Ah, I guess you can send it modding or showcase or something I just started the emulator. That's very fun So We can power things when they explode that'd be a really cool puzzle mechanic I think these mechanics are just like too deep So We don't want anything that's going that far Oh I see the issue. I now see why this wasn't working at all So So So This should give us some really trippy effects really fast Yeah, that's better but this is not what we want Hmm What could be a good one I wonder how the translation role would work out Ideally it would look like a bit of it of the swimming field a few type effect Oh This is I see we overwrote this which just fucks everything up obviously There's also a chance that we just didn't put the values high enough I I'm not entirely sure how the view matrix does the thing Well, this is definitely disorienting but not what we need Interesting Maybe if we subtract 100 or add 100 it could kind of work Then again, I still haven't decided what we want an oil block to actually an oil fuzzy to actually do Oh That's weird as shit Oh my god Yeah, I think someone will run this mod That looks very trippy But looks too much like it's moving left and right It's not what I wanted To all of these make it look like it's moving left and right What are you trying to accomplish here we're trying to accomplish a fuzzy effect and I think this is it Like a trippy filter If you make it a good bit slower I Definitely prefer sweet candy Well, that's not what I was expecting from that It's no good way to sync to the music there is And it's still just this I was hoping to other access as well I Yeah, we're gonna have four police on tier for sure All right, so if we do want the fuzzy filter I think this is it I Although maybe it should be a bit faster not this fast but like a bit faster Increasing and decreasing the field of view. Yeah, we can do that, too I Would have to be something like this I guess Oh Wait Was it reading the fourth Here, okay, let's move this coach here then see how that does it Yeah, I think this is a very trippy effect Of course we want these two effects to be desynchronized from each other But if we do want a trippy effect, this would be it I think Maybe we need to make it a bit stronger, too But it looks pretty good I'm just safe to somewhere and do all this stuff The question is If we do end up with oil fuzzies, what else do we do? Do we have the oil fuzzies in the main level? I feel like yes, I feel like we should have some enemies on the main level and the oil fuzzy is too good for that What else does the oil fuzzy do? How is he different from a normal fuzzy? Makes the music slower. He activates the wobbly effect I Mean Yoshi's getting high when touching White snake enemies. They're called white snake. They're called fuzzies Touch fuzzy get dizzy. Oh They should make Marsh super slippery so you can't stop yes, I like that All fuzzy Mario leaves An oil trail gets super slippery. Can't stop moving The weird Effect happens should you take damage to a Lot of squash and stretch. I should squash and stretch to viewport Or Do you mean you want a squash and stretch Mario I Could strengthen our squash and stretch effect, I guess Mario's squash and stretch effects becomes 5x strong 4x, whatever So, you know spoofy yeah Oh Yes damage Also, Mario can't stop if you try to stop he Can stop forces keep pushing Direction and rotates Also increase the strength of the rainbow effect on the oil That will look wild I have another sick idea Oh Let me see this Wait, why is that happening? I Don't feel so rotated the hue of the fog what is this going on? I Think it looks good Rotate the hue of the fork So the water is gonna be super rainbow the level is gonna glow in rainbow colors the whole viewport is gonna go The view of you is gonna go Mario's gonna be super squashy and stretchy. He's gonna slide all over the place. It's gonna feel uncontrollable. I Don't think we need to deal damage to Mario because you will fall into the oil But I never said I'm doing this for the fan sleek. I'm doing this because I want to Yeah, it will affect the audio I just didn't audio slow down You will be able to walk again BLG during this yes All right, so we're gonna put them in the factory puts them Factory or part another power plant and level Yeah, my Halloween was barely even like a Halloween there were no people coming getting candy I Got all the candy myself To start me to change when I know the animations don't change apart from the super squashy and stretchy one Okay Another enemy I guess is Notice one done as well and So pyramids with random electric spark texture appears every frames or so girls over 10 frames disappears The pyramids act Or two to three maybe two to four and pyramids active at a time Time going Opposites And and close and lights factory and Moves random splines metal stuff that works This is a genuine game effect I See it's possible to do this, but yeah, it just wouldn't look good at all I Mean what we got is as close as we can to that We just need to also have a sine wave that moves that on the X direction and honestly, it will look kind of similar. I think Okay, but we're gonna program these two next time I think for today I am finished We're gonna program two amps and then The amp and fuzzy and the fuzzy is finally an enemy here I think we have an issue with my areas having too few enemies too many friends but yeah, I Will see you guys in the next stream. Bye. Bye
