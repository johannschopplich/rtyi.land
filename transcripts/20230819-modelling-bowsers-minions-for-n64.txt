I Know How about the Mario Party for OST today Okay, I'm muted Do we have a lot of delay right now could that be No Do we have a lot of delay what is going on Nope no Everything was good. Hello Franco Duba So today we're probably gonna start working on the Bowser protest Hello beat arc He double hockey stick ball case what the hell what's that mean? Hello Lila, I heard Unfortunately, the cutscene is fucked and I don't know why you It means hello He double hockey stick ball case Okay, I guess that means hello Hello Nintendo for life Hello sile I Think today we're gonna start on making the protest here The thing is I feel like this level is missing something. I Think it's missing a lot of coins that we put everywhere Like this is too dead for me. You know what I mean? Double hockey sticks usually mean it. Hello cool Sorry, I I've got it someone else video open I'm a fan. Yeah, this one's super open lots of platforming You Can have to start from here in a location instead of from the head since the animation only ever goes one way When I just haven't spawned from the hat isn't it just easier what's the advantage to doing it your way Wait YouTube's telling me about a widget You Tube's not getting enough data to stream properly stream status bad, huh? You might want to smooth shade the platform you stand on to demolish Bowser statue Dude That's actually so weird because it is smooth shaded. I was thinking that too But like I did smooth shaded same with those ones. I don't know what's going on there Hey, wait, this looks smooth except for here I Think I know what's wrong. I know what's wrong. Okay, Lilaa good good thing. You mentioned that I Mean check something It was not smooth shaded never mind, I'm completely wrong I Why is it still not sharp I Have a different color for the demolishing one. That's an interesting idea. I kind of like that Yep, she means that we have a different color per crane and I think that's a good idea and Be very easy to just change it like maybe the demolishing one that's like kind of reddish Although reddish doesn't look good here Purple doesn't look very Bowser II I Mean it's like a dark one. I Kind of like it Darkest Bowser color, you know I Let's do the same thing to the other cranes But if I don't already know made for this game, what's your favorite one so far? You need to pick my favorite one is always the most recent level I made I Don't want to add a buzzer longer to this However rotating train in the rotating crane with a hook And this one has the shading we want what the hell This also has a useless condition triangle does it not Seems useless to me Hello case sir release date PC port hello and bio back French croissant baguette I French moment Can a room might be part of the PC, but sure, you know what you can do You can just make an emulator and the emulator only opens one room and now you have a PC port That's amazing, right? Yeah, the black in kind of looks like shit to be honest I kind of hate this This looks terrible. It doesn't fit at all I am making a big game rom I guess now. I want us to go back in color Unfortunately Zeina's gone today. Otherwise, she maybe would have finished the animation for the guy here Which would have been very cool So Just let maybe a lever you have to kick or push Hmm I See what you mean, yes, but the switch is like so Mario But You didn't know what the soap was for oh, yeah, I didn't even show the finished soap on stream yet Can join the upper leg to the foot that seems like a bad idea. What's you're gonna do with knees? Oh The skinning on this is kind of weird. Honestly Blake blue p-switch by a p-switch. These are four coins I Like the switch, you know why I do it's because every Bowser level in Mario 64 uses this exact switch to help Mario beat the stage This this is just a very Mario 64 Bowser design And games have had levers forever What was the first Mario game with a lever Yeah Yeah, I really like this switch to be honest Wait this switch what the fuck are you guys saying the same thing I do? How's the switch looking like this? Oh Yeah, it's not centered Did I edit the switch this might be my fault and not Nintendo's fault guys don't blame Nintendo just yet Oh Okay, but don't blame me just yet either wait what the fuck How did that happen Oh This is Nintendo's UV map, this is not me I Don't think this looks better Not that the impression recommend for W has been lower to 1 million You can post the switch and say you can never unsee that for quick money Oh Wait only a million. I think I can get a million impressions on Twitter. Wait a second I have 283 thousand already. It's only for it's three months, right? We Can get the meal guys we can make money off of posting stupid bait on Twitter They don't actually pay how much do they pay Lilaa Top mention is khaki death. Sure Okay, wait 250,000 and then Wait, that's just Instead all impressions or just tweets 180,000 and 183 thousand. So three seven two six hundred twenty five thousand. We're so close to the million No, no, no, okay guys following strategy we're gonna be posting more stupid bait We're gonna activate the demonetization on Twitter and then after that we're gonna get Twitter blue and it's gonna pay my bills And I'm never gonna pay for Twitter blue again Check the Twitter page blue subscription pace Where's that I Don't even know where to get Twitter blue Don't call me a blood You're the blood I Think these should be sharp Who that looks cool, I like to switch way better I Didn't interfere t-model. I literally just started doing it I said if the start button would hopefully stop being broken. Nope, your guess for what's being broken is completely wrong Wait, I press the switch Charlie It's still not a very good 3d model I Mean it's decent now Although the shadows when it's flat look really stupid so I have to undo that unfortunately I Didn't think that the shadows like the normals would not transmit translate when you like scale that's really bad I The stream is laggy, that's not good Set model I'll see what can go sure Let's find some bio back here General Purple floss, which On my phone and the stream is not like for me nice Just when you update normal, it's sure I'll just make a dynamic model. That is Normals and it's just gonna be copied in RAM. Actually, that's very possible, but I don't wanna Also, I'm gonna reset the color it's we gotta have a different color I'm thinking maybe dark yellow, maybe But black is just like terrible And dark yellow also just looks wrong no, I don't like this saturated yellow I Also looks terrible cool We're told false information still 5 million are fucking unlucky we're never gonna get monetized on Twitter a Million I would have done that I would have gotten the million impressions 5 million note short Can it be great great look terrible No, I think I think the black look terrible You know in the crane can see what the fuck they're doing Well, but this is Bowser's crane so They don't need to see what doing I Mean orange could work. Let's just try this one. See how this looks in game Green and red. I don't think green fits the art style of this level here Okay, one problem I have with the orange is that the orange appears so much darker than the yellow that we had before It just tends out too much among the other cranes Yellow with black cabin I think that could look good for like a general crane We'd have to change all the cranes which is possible Turn an infant background, maybe I think a background could add a lot to this level. Yeah Also funniest shit ever happened guys I found out when we were in 64 testing this level and it already hit 30 FPS. I Was exporting it as an F 3d model and not every DX 2 So we had twice the verdict loads twice the triangle comments and Some other unoptimizations and it still ran fine We could export it again and see how well it runs Either way orange looks terrible. I'm not doing orange Maybe I'd be up for something like this. That means I can end a 20 million polysphere for fun. True! Oh, that sounds sick, Lila. Oh yeah, I like the crane now. I think that's a fine color. Alright, you know what, let's try the level on our N64 again. Now keep in mind, an optimization idea that we were thinking of was to make it so that Link increases the FPS by like 5, 6. So whatever you're seeing right now, it's probably going to be 5 to 6 slower than what actually is going to be in the final game. But let's see it. I build them with Blender. Oh shit, I have another sick thing that might happen. So this week, a merch company has written me, and they said they can print custom products. So they were saying, if we want to, we can make N64 boxes and sell those as merch. With like an instruction booklet, official, and all that. So we could actually just print N64 boxes for all the games. That would be sick merch. Dude, when I sell RGYI, I could just sell the box without the ROM, and it'd be legal. And then I would also make a ROM that's just the OST and sell that. Dude, we're gonna be fucking millionaires. Dude, we're gonna make a full ROM making company. If that works out, I'm like, I don't know, maybe I'm gonna start hiring people. Oh right, shit, it has this issue. I forgot. Either way, even with these visuals, it seems to run pretty well. Yeah! Yahoo! I'm taking 10% of the royalty for doing like 25% of the work with the set. You know what, if the set makes decent money, I have to pay you. I completely agree. I was offering to pay the musicians as well, for like the rights to the music, once everything's done. Yeah. Fix this so we can see proper performance test? Fine. Clip ratio. What level are we working on? Wet dry world? Wet dry world is 11, as every single person on this world knows. Okay, wait. The joke's kinda lost here, because wet dry world is actually the 11th course. Which is a complete coincidence. Because the level ID and the actual course number is completely independent from each other. Like Bomber's Battlefield is 9. Yeah, it's a one line change. Fucked up Yoshi of the week, let's go. These don't seem fucked up. Oh, nevermind. Hm. How to change the original Mario 64 light to directional? So a man named Wiseguy made a thing called Matrix Stack Fix. In the original game, the whole world is being transformed around the camera. There's not like a view matrix. So if you put a light source into the original game, your light source is gonna be transformed by the camera. So you effectively cannot put world lighting, unless you do like reverse math. So what you need to do is you need to use Wiseguy's Matrix Stack Fix. And then you just put a light, and it will be a world light. Let's go. Ah, this performance seems pretty good to me. For such a big level, I can't complain. Oh, I didn't even show you guys the whomps yet. So this should theoretically be the laggiest place on the level. Yeah, 22. But keep in mind, we're gonna enable backface culling here. For all these gates. So this is gonna go way down. The lag is gonna go way down. It's also just one situation, so who really cares. They're not shit whomps, they're oil whomps. Dude, it's so hard to play with this input lag, you guys have no idea. If anyone complains about my gameplay, they can go fuck themselves. Was that an unnecessary triangle right here in my level? Did you guys see it? Dude, this song is such a banger. Oh, it's just a triangle that's a bit too big. Wait, no, it's not. What the hell? What the hell?! What is this? What is this? Alright, well, that's two triangles down. Fullscreen? I can do that. Sneaky try, sneaky try. Dude, too bad we don't have the emote anymore. This is also the laggiest button. Actually, this might be the actual laggiest button in the level. But again, we have no culling yet. Nothing. Yeah, literally no culling. This is an 8000 polygon level. No render areas. We didn't even sort the triangles yet. Sorting the triangles will also give us a big performance boost. I don't know why I'm doing this.   Oh yeah, and we didn't make a collision map yet. Which will also help. Because when you make a collision map, you actually reduce the amount of collision triangles. And you guys know what's also beautiful? I think I found the bug that caused only Up64 to crash. And now RTYI is so stable on the N64. The inconsistent FPS is pretty weird. Well, that's why... I mean, this is going to be the default. You're supposed to play with limited FPS. So it's going to be a whole lot less when you're playing on the N64.     You have to play like this. It's really hard to play with lag, though. I have like half a second of input lag. I just have to know what Mario's going to do when I press a button. And then react to what's going to happen in two seconds. Ah, no. 20 FPS interpolation looked terrible. I tried it, but no. Oh, all the heads are fucked up. Oh, also, sick new thing. If you use NEMU64, you can... Wait, I didn't even tell you guys about this yet. A new emulator dropped recently called NEMU64. Yes, NEMU, the emulator from 2002. And they updated it. And it's so much better now. And you can debug everything with it. You can debug this playlist with it. Under 19? You saw an un-go under 19? I didn't. It was a consistent ready at the end, wasn't it? How is this going to have GNU debugger, though? Oh, oh. GNU debugger? Do you mean... Do you mean if you go to... Plugin and then go to the GDB debugger, wait for connection? Do you mean that? The feature I can use right now on this emulator because it already exists? You mean that, Lilaa? That debugger? Cache emulation, of course. Yes, F3 accepts fangames. Yes. Just use DecomBannon. It makes your life way easier. All right, let's spread some coins around this level. Hackasm64 is the most convenient way to start hacking Mario. It's like a thing that's made for like a mix of usability and performance. If they can take a performance improvement without hurting usability, they're going to have it in there. But it's not going to be maximized on performance. No idea what Lilaa was talking about because I blocked her. Thanks for sharing that. That's so funny to me. Is it C or C++? They're the same thing, really. Okay. If that's a concern for you, then... Never mind. I was going to say... Bad things. They had a similar 3D modeling software that was just a lot worse and slower. What am I going to do for this level right now? Right now I'm spreading coins so that the level looks a bit more populated. I wonder if I can put like a coin ring here. Shit, I just realized that I put a bunch of vertical coin formations because I forgot to change the B' to 0. C++ is just C with classes? Yeah. And you can program classes in C as well if you want. So there's not really a point to it. I think C++ is just a shitty version of C. Here's my hot take for the day. Actually, never mind. There's one good thing in C++ and that is templates. Templates are tolerable. I accept them. I think they're good. Classes equals bad. They are just like an unnecessary obstruction if you ask me. What the fuck happened to the floor? How did I do that? What the fuck? Oh, that really should have crushed me. What? What is so fucked up that I can't look at it? No, this is not 1.6. There's some memory corruption somewhere. Shouldn't be hard to find. Don't worry about it. I mean, the only thing I changed was add a bunch of coin formations and then suddenly this started happening. Okay. Let's remove some of these coin formations again and see if that fixes it. Okay. The moon jump is coded then, because every time you recompile the ROM, your cheat codes are gonna get wiped. Did I get shadow banned from chat or something? Yes, I'm the only one who can read your messages. No one else can read them right now. Okay, something clearly happened to the floor. Wait, I removed two triangles. There's no way that removing those two triangles had all these effects, is there? There's also the coin formations that seem to have done that. Okay. Guys, would I ever lie to you? Would I ever gaslight you? Me? You think I would do that? Okay. What? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. How did this happen? How did the material get shorter? What the hell? Okay. What proved your second theory? The starring imposter proved what? What the hell? No, you're just wrong. The issue is that the camera is not updating its render focus. That is the only issue. Okay, if you see a bug in my game, then I will likely already know what the solution is. Unless I specifically say, what the fuck, I don't know what's causing that. That means I already know the solution. The crazy thing is that there's just something over there that's causing this. Wait a second. I know what's causing this. Okay. I think the yellow coin model got unloaded. What the fuck? Then fix the bug? No. See, this is one thing I'm generally not understanding, but this has nothing to do with any star. I don't even see a star right now. How do you unload the coin model? The coin model is loaded per area and you need to call special code to load it again. Oh, that confirmation is bad anyway, because it's not in the crash. I won't have removing it, we'll just fix it because it sure feels like there's something over here that's just causing this to happen. I think it might also be the crane hook. How much of it do you have to modify for it to not count as a system save anymore? Doesn't matter. Nintendo is paying the copyright law, yes? It says I'm 64 if Nintendo says so. Yeah, that completely fixes it. Huh, did I have weird values on this? Am I missing something? 0, 2, 0. Huh. This is in the shape of the Nintendo IP. So. Legendary coins are rendering fine, but Mario and the level are not. So there should probably be something rendering there maybe. No, what's the coin? There's not just gonna be one thing that's causing this. The coin is somehow gonna lead to a memory corruption further down the line. Why have I defined this here? Ah, I guess that was a thing I wanted to do. To like move these objects with defines into the same file. Not really a fan of that anymore. Are the coins rendered before the level Mario then? They don't render before. Your internet seems to be working. Hmm. Okay, I have no theory as to what happened there. Unless... No, that doesn't make any sense. The coin render array is not full. We have a giant coin render array that's for sure not full. That is actually very concerning. I think our next step should be designing a background. So I want the sea to look like it's very far out to the sides. So I have to fade it out to the sides. The problem is if I fade it too early, it will look claustrophobic. The other problem is if I render it too far, it's gonna look shitty on N64 like we just saw. So I need to add coins to the dino domain. Yeah. Is this rendering really where near the edge as well? On N64, yes. That's because of the frost at the clip ratio. I think in the background there should be more steel. See, one cool thing about having it like this, like we do right now... It looks like it's just fading into fog at the edges. And I like that. Oh. Actually, it doesn't really work because the clip ratio is still too low for that. Hmm. We could bring the fog closer in. And add 3D modeled steel beams and stuff over there. So it looks like there's platforms in the background. But I don't know if it's gonna look like it's going on forever. Make the sky look foggy. Yeah. I'm thinking of maybe having it painted on oil rigs. Okay. We have the problem that that's gonna look really close though. Yeah, I agree, Capricorn. I'm just thinking of how to do it exactly. We can displace the skybox in only the X and Z direction. I think that could look really good. And then it would be like a really tall skybox. I wonder if that would work. Do you think that would work? Oil rigs all around the course. Four or six of them. Maybe that would look bad. No, no, I like that. The problem is, if we have that many 3D models, it's gonna start lagging. This is already a pretty tough level to render. And I also really need to bring the fog in closer. Because the way it is right now, it's too far. C11, new VG. Let's just make a new version of this. And we're gonna work on that version. I'm thinking we should bring it in this close. And then this is gonna be where the fog starts. Do we all need to be in the skybox, not the 3D model? Maybe. We can do that, but it might also look shitty if we do that, you know. Should smooth the alpha on the steel beams. Should smooth the alpha on the steel beams. Like on the background. They don't have any alpha on the background. On these? Have them like fade out towards the bottom? Have them be on layer 5? Do you know how this would look if the steel beams were on layer 5? Nothing would work. Could I expand the ocean a bit more? If we expand the ocean, is it... I have a sick idea. Is this gonna work? Let me think about this. Okay, I have something that might look awesome or it's gonna look terrible. It's one of those two. Okay. Okay, by now you might be thinking, Case, what the fuck are you doing? Trust. Okay. Needs to be transparent decal. So you don't translate the white, it will look cool. IMO. Alright. I have no idea what this is gonna look like. I've never done this before. I feel like there could be so many unforeseen consequences. Oily, boily, bay. BG. How do you make sure the textures you use aren't displayed when the game is built? You don't. Okay. Okay. Two, three, four, five. Okay, five. Maybe we can set like a flag, like 0x15. I have two switch positions, I'm not sure which one is better. Do they use vertex colors? I think this one looks really cool. It's an interesting design, but it doesn't feel like Mario 64. That's probably also way too high poly. This one here also looks really cool, but I'm worried that this is using vertex colors. Because if it's using vertex colors, we can't use the real light thing anymore. But you can actually just use vertex alpha and you're gonna get the same thing. I think this one's pretty good. Circle button or square button? Guys, this one here is like 4000 polygons. Right one is 1336 polygons only. Do you guys see the issue? Okay. Okay. I mean, B has very obvious shitpost, but you also get a face value and some presses. Yes! I thought that is a shitpost. Undeclared. I think they took it at the face value, because I pretended to. Only shitty default lighting, do you want it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It looks really good. Hello, Sas, the man. TheRombieZ64. Discord, discord, discord, discord. Sure, buddy. It would be pretty badly, though. What's far away and is it far? That's how far away the model is. It's 99% far away. Okay. Took it down to 1. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very good. Distance percentage. That makes no sense. So it wouldn't be that bad. It would be better when we're in a small room. Yeah. All right. I will import your model right now. Shit. How did he call it? Purple floor switch. You also reduced the triangle count, didn't you? This is so much better than the one we had before. This actually just looks like an upgraded version of the Mario 64 one. Very, very nice. Wait, and somehow you managed to fit this in such a small texture. Okay. Is this better as a CI8 or an RGBA? It's better as an RGBA. Because the palette is 512 byte. Yes. It is mirrored lila. You can reduce. The colors are different, but I think they're better. Okay. The gold is different. The problem is the same. Yeah, that's what I thought. If you keep fog, you should definitely color everything else. How do you think that's possible? How is that supposed to work? I think Bio made the bevel extremely small and stretched it across the model like an airtight plastic wrap. I don't think he changed geometry much. I think he just removed to use the subdivision. This is both the same formula, but this one is for the oil water. So I actually need this here. I think the alpha. Which model is that? That's the one we want. Yeah. 96 seems promising. Moment of truth. It didn't compile. Of course, I need to make clean. I hate that this happens. No, not make. There we go. I have not changed the geometry. I've just changed the texture. Oh. Okay. Oh, I see you. Okay. I was thinking those rainbows to materials with, you know, two textures, but it was just one material that changed to purple. I see. I now see it all. I remember that's further away than the focus don't render. I'm actually not much about rendering works. Marking every triangle that's too far away to render. I'm impossible, but that's going to be like 15 times more expensive than just rendering a level. Just fix the warnings and makes the compiler slow. You can fix these warnings. Look at this. Let's say I compile this file. It says warning register of GKern object used for multiple global register variables. Yes, it is used for multiple variables because that makes the game like 2% faster. It's warning me that I'm writing good code. What do you want me to do? Write bad code? What about some warnings which can be ignored by pragmas? This one cannot be ignored by a pragma. At least I couldn't find one. And like 90% of the warnings I would usually get are warnings from the original game. That's just like Mario 64 is not very good. And with the code and it's just original Mario 64 code that's throwing the warnings. 0, 1, 2. Somehow my NPG is not rendering. Oh, I know why. I have all the warnings. Enabled that would warn me of code being not optimal, but I cannot turn this off, right? This is the same warning over and over It's just warning me that I have a special register that holds a variable and it's like I have one of these per thread Ha Interesting I Wonder if the issue even is here Let's disable this part by part until we know the issue Okay, listen this code here No, okay. Look, I think the warnings are good and I'm using warnings on purpose to warn me of code That might not be optimal But there's just so much code that is not optimal still left from the original Mario 64 That I can't fix at all feasibly. There's just too much of it around like eventually maybe I'll go through it, but it's gonna take like tens of hours until it's all done and In the meantime, these warnings are helpful for writing my own codes because if a warning shows up here And it's not one of these two warnings here about the thing I'm doing. Well, then I'm gonna look into it I Know it won't tell me what a crash happens, but I know it's because I'm rendering the background here. Oh I only that the F here that would explain the crash Also, I don't think they make the compiler slow Making the whole project from clean takes like 20 seconds. So I don't think they have a big impact Okay, that did not work I Mean okay, the underground is here But it's way too high up and the background is completely not rendering Hmm Well, most of it is not even gone it's just like unused files because I have a warning that wants me of everything that might be unused What the fuck I Definitely need to fix that one, too. I Thought I did That's not good Notepad stream, let's fucking go I think the issue is that it is rendering this on the wrong layer Because our background is like on multiple layers at once I Like right here Is there anything that can be improved for nervousness optimization, I mean in the original render and Mario 64 Yes, there's a lot of optimization in this project right here There's gonna be a lot less but I feel like if we optimize the microcode we could still get like Four to five percent performance out of it. Maybe even more Okay, but to be fair the collision issues would have been there in original 64 as well in original 64 You just be walking through the crane. So it's not a big deal But if we change the render mode Oh Maybe I can change the order of triangles here to render better Nope the background still doesn't render Okay So thinking about this this needs to render first and then the oil water and then the fake alpha So let's sort mesh elements by material export again, maybe What even is our order right now? Ah There we go Okay, this feels like it's so far away But it's not you see what I mean It does look weird What game engine is this Mario 64 It is oh, yeah, it is still when she at the edges Okay, but that means okay that and that makes me know what the glitch is done. So that's good Looks mismatched exactly and the fog comes in way too early I Mean a lot of that is because the waves are so high right now They're very yet. Very very easy to fix down. So that's not a big deal Let me just fix them right now see how it works Yeah, it does not look like fuck Yeah, this isn't good This is bad But what alternative options do we have let's think about this. What else can we do? I'm trying to do I got lost. I'm trying to make it have a good background We can't try a lower far away, let's see how that works So I'm making music goobers blowing Mario now Which we mistake for products as your motion means invent the server so far away. Yeah kinda But yeah now this looks like it's just floating in the sky which is very very bad And then when you're high up it looks yeah, yeah, I look at that that's terrible this is awful Like the ways fade into a solid dark blue don't pick up the gradient in the sky box It's still gonna look like the things are just stuck in the sky box here That's What really bothers me I feel like an end BG doesn't work if The elements in your level are touching the sky box. I Think that's a rule of thumb here I don't think so, but they are floating in the sky right now It will never work I can mathematically prove that this will never work I think the idea is fundamentally wrong Fitting out the polygons be too resource-intensive. That's what we're doing We're not fading out the polygons here Let's think how can we make an ocean that looks really really big What if the ocean was going up near the rims of the level I That's a crazy idea, but I think it will work I That's the wrong vertex I'm supposed to do it right here Likely gonna be way too high but it is an idea I Just want to see what this concept of theory looks like Well, then Great I We're just stuck in the rainbow crater I Interesting that makes the ocean look a lot bigger I Don't know where the alpha fade went though. Oh I must have messed it up. Oh, yeah, I did definitely mess it up I Now it looks like the faraway stuff is gonna go under Although it really shouldn't And it still has the issue that if we go up the skybox just starts eating the level Yeah, I think the NBG is just not the possible here, of course counting is possible in the n64 I But culling is not even what we're thinking about we are right now thinking about how to make the background look good Yeah, that's actually it and we run the problem that making the water be too far away is Is Bad because we have a culling area. So if anything's too far away from the camera It's gonna just not be visible and there's no way to get around that. It's a hardware limitation We were thinking of just putting it closer and Like having the camera rendered and then have it be like below everything But that also doesn't work I Guess now things don't interact with the water anymore. I think the water has to be in the 3d model There's no way around it Yeah, the more I think about it the more I'm sure of it It's impossible By mixer you have to create it would be fine No, of course the gradient is fine, but I'm not thinking about how to make a gradient I'm thinking about how to make the water look good And Back to what we had before More experimentation needed The water can't be at a height relevant tomorrow to avoid culling No, because if we do that then as soon as you jump the water is just gonna start and the level is just gonna start being flooded Which would be stupid, wouldn't it? That would not look good What if you think that that plus water with the level water and rendered both Huh, you want me to render water twice? What's that gonna do? Going to fix a terribly optimized game No How's that gonna help anything That's not just because the collision map gets corrupted That's because we have too many collision triangles. It's not gonna be a real issue Like in the thing you did for the wing cap skybox on the far away water Exactly. That is what's not working because that's always been this behind now Imagine if this water here has a wave you see how it now kind of obstructs this that's gonna get lost if we do that technique Especially if we have a skybox like this Because now as soon as you like go higher up and the skybox follows you It looks like the things just starting to float on the background What are those massive invisible boxes I have no idea blend out of them I Have been working on this over a few months now But I have a full-time job on the side. So that's why I don't have too much time to just work on this all the time Outside the level you could do that No, it's gonna follow you around you you would have to know where the boundaries are It's a job programmer I Guess if we wanted we could Try that technique that why do I have to OBS open? Why did my GCC just turn into OBS? If you really wanted we could have it so that it goes up among the rims Like we had before But with the 3d model That would make the ocean maybe look a little bigger I Don't know Hello MPG Yes, smart vision I am full-time in CFP I Don't know for how much longer I'll be there but that is my current situation Oh Tremendous motherfuck. I mean we already have fake fuck in there and actually also real fuck. So oh God what happened to this the steel beam disappeared Where did the steel beam go did I kill it on accident? Oh I see the issue, no big deal. If I would have been Construction Marked with how ripped you are, I wish that would be so much easier than being a programmer. So Scott was not Giga Leaked. Decomp didn't exist, I would just make my own video games I think. Maybe I'd be making a game in assembly right now. Okay so I like, I kinda like how the ocean looks honestly. What I don't like is how big it has to be in physical space for it to work. So if maybe we could make it so that this is smaller, that would be perfect. Somehow we gotta make it smaller without also completely making it look like shit. That's our big issue here. Oh I'm not adapted well to the outside environment. I'm kinda like a vampire. I would die in the sun. I am the whitest man alive. Oops. I would not survive 24 hours in Florida. I think I would survive 24 hours in Florida. I think it's very easy to survive in Florida. If Americans can do it, it can't be difficult. Does this make the sea look more vast is my question. I think it does. You think the sea looks further now than it did before? Even though we kinda pulled the vertices in. I think it's kind of like an optical illusion that works because you expect the sea to be flat. I don't think anyone looks at this and is like hmm, the sea looks ugly curved. You missed us theorycrafting how to make the sea look further. So now we can probably put the fuck back. I really should be getting squished there. Wait, was there no coin sound? Oh, it's there. How has everyone done for Resident Evil Banjo-Kazooie? We are on the last world actually. We have like 115 stars done or maybe even 118. I'm gonna use this question in the OG game. Why? What's it gonna do? What if the universe gets smaller the further away from so it gives the illusion of distance? That is a really good idea but computationally that's gonna be so expensive. Expand it as far as you can. It's already expanded further than we can and that's why it's giving us trouble. Why don't I stream that? Because no one gives a shit about it. If I stream that I get like zero viewers. I could probably do it another way but this is I think faster which is a bit miserable but this is the situation we live in a society. Okay, that's a lot less miserable now that I realize I can do that. Dude, this song was a bop when it came out in 2004. Oh guys, have you heard the newest drama? I don't know anything about this drama but I was approached today because someone wanted my input on the drama and I was like what the fuck are you talking about? But apparently there's new beta Mario 64 Romhacks drama. Very exciting. Very exciting times for the Mario 64 beta community. It's been a while since the last drama I think like at least two months. And you mean the B33131? You know about this? Wait, you guys know about this? Everyone does except for me. Oh shit, when the Koopa isn't here you can't draw on the cement. That's a problem. Apparently the team that worked on one of those beta recreations has beef with the creator and it's like the biggest one of them out there. And they wanted my input and my input was like yeah, he seems like a solid guy. I think that was the opposite of what they wanted. I think this looks really good. Now we just need to add a bit of a gradient to it. Any other ones that are fucked? I don't think so. You were one of those staffs? Let's go. What happened? I haven't had any bad experience with the guy that you know made B3313 or I don't know if he made it. I think it was just like one of the people working on it. So I want to know like what is going on over there. I think Biobak wanted us to do a blue gradient here so let's just add it before he tells me to do it. You know how when your mom tells you to bring out the trash you don't want to do it anymore? That's what we're doing here. You barely had anything to do with this? Oh okay. It's not an nfbg. An nfbg doesn't work if the elements in your level are touching the background. Hello we crashed because they opened obs. But no texture? No we're gonna add a texture. Don't worry about that. But we're not gonna make it an nfbg. I don't know where you can turn on the cursor in obs. I'll set it in lofty lumber leaps. Yeah but lofty lumber leaps fades out towards the bottom. It doesn't actually touch it. We can't do that here. That kind of looks pretty good. Although I'm not quite on board with it. Somehow you managed to turn the cursor on by opening obs. Huh? Are you sure it was ever off? Am I being gaslighted? So the simpleweb said yes he gave this to me for free. I just had to model. You don't know if a sandbox texture will look good? I haven't decided on yet. But I know that I want to add metal constructs here. Hmm what is the object called? Probably the first thing I want to render the level. Are you okay? No I'm thinking. How can I do this? What is this? Why does it not render right? How's there still like a break? Unless. Unless these are not a 2048 negative from the get-go. Oh my god I just realized that's a possibility. 2.009 oh you b!tch. So these are 39 too low. Or 39 up from what I think they should be. What's going on? My mouse just turned 5 fps. I'm going to turn the cursor on manually go to the screen capture bar. Why? I don't know how it was off. I am stream also dropped frames. Damn. My stream might have just my pc might have just been fucked. For a second. Something really weird about this background. Let's think about this way fight max is 256. So the most that can be up at any point is to 512. So if you take this and go 512 and we take this and go 512 minus that should perfectly cover the background but it doesn't. I have a like 3060 ti and like a super strong cpu. It's like a thousand dollar modern setup. I need it for my work. So some of my recording is always shit though.  Oh, I know what it is. Of course. We do this here. Duh. It's uh 25627 plus 14218 38 844 divided by 32 1200. But if you go 1213 and we should probably move the lowest edge of it down by like. I don't know 200 maybe. This looks fucked but trust. So this is rising the fact that raises words to the camera horizon and make the beast look like they. Huh, but that's basically what I'm doing here. So they had the same idea. Don't regret going to youtube. I don't know. I still think twitch is gonna die. Oh yes, that is what I want. Oh that is so much nicer. Got a secret side in plain sight. Where the streets are empty that's where we run. Still as I could do. Rectange is the edge of the actual water model. Oh that looks good too. Oh I see what you want now. They have a little bit of a problem here because we use fuck in the level. I really like how you suck star. We could be heroes. Let's see. So if I get this right. Can I just pick the colors out of your image? I can't. Oh but your ocean is also a completely different color from mine. My ocean is like reddish or not red but it's like oily. I think you kind of have something like this going on. We could be heroes. We could be heroes. We could be. Whoops. Am I getting the idea right, Biobak? Is this the idea? Maybe my course is just hard to see because I move it around a lot. Maybe blend the heights. No that won't make no sense. I should give you some useful info about some big brain programmer chat stuff. I have the brain mass of a goldfish. Yeah you can just chill here and be a nuisance. That's all fine. Okay I think this idea has a lot of potential. What do you think, Biobak? Need the edge of the water to be the same as the skybox gradient. Yeah yeah yeah look I did that. Don't worry. I am not a glue eater. This is what I thought as well. We are in agreement.  I hope it's not gonna look weird on the inside edges. Okay. Let's keep this link for after the stream, check it out, I'm sure you'll find that stuff very useful. Oh, alright, let me just move this into my tabs. Dude, why are people in my chat so smart compared to the average person on the planet? I think everyone here just gets smarter by watching me, to be honest, like you should just keep watching me to expand your brain, I don't know, just my opinion though. I think we can move it down a little. We're slowly figuring out the best skybox here. Hello Z64, you missed us designing the background. Seeing an attention to people in chat, I'm seeing 45 people watching a guy type text into Notepad. This still just kinda looks wrong to me. I think I still need to move it further down, and I think I can. Yeah, yeah, I agree, definitely has to be moved further down still. The colors I had before were the same gradient concept. The color I had before was just orange. We're going to be focusing on gameplay more- oh yeah, okay, don't worry, let's just make the game look like shit, people only want gameplay. Why do we even have graphics? Let's just replace Mario for just a box. Maybe we make the box red if we're generous. What color is lavender? Let's just describe it using only six hex digits. Hello Clayman. I did make a mod that removes whole textures, it's called Chinese Knockoff Mario 64. I think this has a charm to it. I think this one's a bit too big. I also think maybe we should do something like this. Oh god, what happened? It was not focused around the right center point. It doesn't look as far away as in Biobak's thing, that's the one issue I'm having with this. I don't get the vibe that this is further away, I just get the vibe that it's painted on the horizon. It doesn't look far, it looks painted on. What is making that effect happen? We should try using E6-E6FA like you were before. What? E6-E6FA? No way! It's too close and you see the perspective changing? Yeah, I think so too. No way that's lavender! What? That's not E6-E6FA, no way! This looks like E0-C0FF maybe. I got pretty close. Oh, but this is a lighter shade. It's not E6-E6AF. What? E6-E6FA? That's what that is. You know the E6 I'm talking about though? I know what E6-E6FA is. You were tricked by Bing. How do you let Bing lie to you about something like that? I might as well have said 1 plus 1 is 3 and you would have... That's what that sounds like to me. What if we have normal ocean floor and then this is just the inf BG? Let's try this. I think that idea has potential. I don't even remember the color. Yeah. Now I'm going to mix Biobak's idea with something new here. New strategy today, honestly. This is a new invention, maybe. I don't know. I think the horizon line has to look very flat for it to work. Agreed. Agreed. Softlight purple looked awesome with the rest of the color palettes. We had an orange before. Oh, you mean in the stream just now? Now I know what you're talking about. I remember now. This has a charm to it. Oh, what happened over there? Oh no. Oh no. I think we can make it work like this. I think we can make it work. Okay.  Where did my level go? Oh, it detected this as two separate files. Great. I'm going to kill one of them. Hello, Ciela Cheryl. I think you should try to lower the bluish horizon a bit. I might be wrong, but it could look more natural. Yeah, we're trying to figure out the best way to do it right now. The thing is, we have to have it be relatively close, so we can't have it be too low, or it's going to look like the C just ends way too short. We are working on making this perfect here at Case Industries. We gotta make clean again. Great. We should make it more round, maybe. Attack scroll to pink. What's needing this file? Oh my god, there's like... I didn't know this was a thing. That is pretty terrible. Any highlights of the stream? I'm not sure. The boss of just all ringstones should be Bowser in giant construction mesh with a draw on one arm. Well, that wouldn't be fun. I don't want to do that. Bowser was already the boss in the level right before this. Dude, how is it so much work just to remove a texture scroll? Holy shit. Hello, Charles Aufmuth. Oh, that is disgusting. That's a big problem. How would you like the texture scrolls to work? I don't know. Maybe when you delete... No, I don't know how this would work. It does make it look more infinite though. More infinite. It looks terrible though. So let me try my idea from before. Okay. Okay.  If you can think of a good solution, you should suggest it. I can't think of one. Huh? It doesn't even matter that I put the position to zero. Wait. I think it might be reading a value that's just zero. I want to make it work for a stealer. It still looks like shit right now. There's no point in trying anything until this works. Oh. There we go.  Because of culling radius, that's why. Oh, this is way better. Okay. Okay.  If we find the right way to translate this, then this is perfect. So zero is clearly not enough. Should this? Maybe. Based on camera translation uh camera pitch should we maybe pitch this by the same as the camera shouldn't be more prevalent like the ocean maybe that's what Lilaa is saying too but let's see i wanted to look decent first before i try anything like that okay here's one issue the side that is closer to the camera seems to be doing looking a lot better than the other side how can that be is it moving too far to the camera wait this is also so big it has to work like this or it's not gonna work at all it needs to move more with the camera than that okay one is clearly too much 0.7 is clearly too little maybe 0.9 once we have the height right we can check out why the horizon looks weird i think 0.9 is getting close maybe 0.95 all right i'm starting to have hope for this wait did i make it worse oh yeah you're right 0.8 good try actually 0.8 is definitely too low 0.85 let's try that oh the music makes you sad i don't even know these songs from my childhood these are all new songs to me so i have no nostalgia here okay we can maybe do a little more than that and let's also address the other issue in the room i'm trying to play bad music yep you got me i love them on me feeling sad hey look if music invokes emotion in you isn't that always a good thing oh oh yeah oh you know what that doesn't matter if you can't get high enough to actually see that issue happening when does it happen yeah it starts happening like there but you can't get that high show i think this is awesome Biobak what do you think i think maybe i can increase the multiplicator a little bit still why did they say that it looked bad at 0.9 again let me check that out hi i'm Biobak and i think you should try the previous color damn you're starting to impersonate Biobak to try and make me do stuff oh it's too high wait and 8.5 was too low i think the water should be the same color all across but the effect is nice what what the fuck is going on is this too low again hey and this part of the ocean lies deeper in sweden i guess they're going to change bro's altitude yeah it's not simple to get this right okay good this is too low okay we're getting there and now we're finally getting the perfect number it says course block instead of course one really that doesn't matter okay 0.85 am i just opening the rom so fast that the complete compile changes like didn't come in before could that be maybe that's why this is so confusing i'd say this is near perfect this is about as good as we're gonna get it because otherwise that side is gonna go down the font is really good what do you mean all right i think the water should be the same color all across but the effect is nice okay so you want me to change the horizon color am i getting you right here should i go with lila's suggestion of having it be kind of a pink is that what we are thinking here i think it was something like this what was my color like like that all right let's export and compile you should change the color of the osha we're working on it is that the color you were wishing for i got like 12 course i think i liked your other one my other one don't fucking give me e6e6fa that one's awful me i mean the ocean color is more like this darker i guess i didn't make it darker just now the color fade is weird kind of yeah we're turning into a radio station right now no it's just somewhere in the playlist i don't hate this i think it works i want to check the color code from the oil ocean it's possible but it might be different here the color of the ocean is like super dark it's like a dark blue it just doesn't appear that way it's kind of fading into more of a orange red at the edges which i can try to do like i think that would be like a good fade color if you want it yeah yeah you know what let's try that to make it look like it's actually part of the fuck maybe that makes the most sense is it worth deriving a delta from the darkest and brightest color in the ocean hey hey what are you talking about a delta what you want to do with the delta it's maybe a bit too purple  just thought but i don't understand what you're trying to propose more red like the ocean yeah i made it a little more red i want to look smooth with the fork now it's still too pink  maybe make it darker maybe yeah fine let's make it darker okay why don't you just make mario start in obb so you don't have to go down the pipe every time because he's not going to start on the right location and the world lighting isn't going to be applied i think this is perfect so but not perfect render color management view transform for render then color management i'm already lost there's no color management render on the right tab all the things that i need all the things that you need f3d render options when i see you baby i just don't wanna let go okay at this point it's just the fog color stone like there isn't much ocean anymore anymore in there dude why are there people running around in front of my window get back in your house i'm a grumpy old man get off my lawn did you do the thing i suggested i don't know is this the thing you suggested this almost looks just like volumetric fog or something smothers you kick some butts life please i'm not trying to get arrested i'm gonna get kicked out of canada blender render settings there is no blender menu i went into the render settings but there was color management oh render and then render settings nope there's no render settings here what do you want me to do f3d render settings like the object settings object this is this is the object settings i'm guessing object properties i've been trying not to go dude i wouldn't mind programming in jail right Lilaa i have no idea what you're talking about tap on the object select render what where the up there's like 15 different object settings hover over the button that says render where there's object settings like they they're everywhere there's object settings like here and then there's object settings like here and then there's object settings like here and there's object settings here it's like five different versions of those where's the screenshot Lilaa kick Lilaa in the butt i'm gonna kick her to the butt and until she's on the moon with one kick that's object settings you think that is object settings the fucking microwave simple i don't think you want to get me and then she says render settings color management and then what was that i can lift you up let's see where did she want me to go afterwards view transform set it to standard view transform is set to standard it was already set to standard i have never changed it Lilaa this is just what it was either way i think i'm done for today the background looks really good now hopefully i can think of like metal constructs to add everywhere to make this look so big i'm gonna just put some random shit in there i feel like if i just make it small enough maybe if i had like 2d cutouts of like shit in the background just add it to the nfbg it's gonna look pretty good but yeah i'll see you guys in the next stream bye
