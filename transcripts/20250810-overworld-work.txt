Hello. Hello. Hello x links. It's so tight on me. Hello Nintendo for life. Hello Mimoski. Hello everyone. I was working on a bunch of minor optimizations and on my to-do list this week. I got quite a few fixes done. I also finished my next video. And then I finished another half a video after that. So we have two videos coming soon. I'm being gigaprotective. Hello. I DM you in response to your DMs. Okay. Don't pin this on me. You were gone last week. I missed a few streams. We were working on the overworld programming. I don't think I can show you any of it because... Well, there are certain unlocks you need to do to actually see it. You can kind of see the outline of the boot here. I'd be extremely impressed if anyone could tell she was here. I think I'll make her a slight bit less transparent. You're bad. True. Feel ashamed, idiot. At least that's her name. Minecraft mod. Seems reasonable. Whoa, what the fuck is that? That's today's episode. More programming for the overworld. This seems like a good transparency level. It's like you can kinda tell something's there, but you don't know what it is. That's very mysterious. And there's also a good chance you miss it. Please don't tell me I should make a video about it. I made that video today. Is that a joke? So, we lost... Oh, right! We were at Dory! We need to make Dory be locked to the floor with an anchor. And then after you beat the first Bowser level, she's free. So what's the best way to chain her to the floor? Do we just put a chain and an anchor around her? I think that might work. Let's do it. Who is DMing me? I have not allowed this. It is hubboy. Midstream. Unbelievable. Any OST wishes for today? Hello Mariah the Human. My man, you're the best one. Thank you. So, she is going to be chained to the floor at first. Until you free her. Doom OST. You know what? I want Sinny. That's what I'm in the mood for. We need an anchor. Do we have an anchor? We have some in course 5. Let's use those. You're not excited about DIY? Well, the game is slowly getting done. We have all 15 main courses now in the game and programmed. And now we're working on the overworld. Marty has been working on a side level this whole time. And it's looking so cool. Look at this. It's a very elaborate level. It should be possible to finish all my ROMAX in time. Well, if you do something like Mario 64 Madness 100% without save states. Maybe not. That one is pretty difficult to do. Hello Asuko. What's missing for part 2? Only this part here. The rest is done. Dang, everything on the screen. That's a lot. Does that really count? How do you discern between which save state saves you time versus which one makes the game easier? Because if you think about it, if you can get something 1 out of 1000 times. Then making a save state after that thing only saves you time. Because you know you can get there. So really, there is no difference between save stating only when it saves you time. And save stating every single time. It really is the same thing. Is that the new model that you didn't make? Inertia is pretty fun. I like it too. How does it feel to playtest with other people for a month? It usually doesn't take long. So usually the way that playtests work is I just message the people that have filled out the beta test application form. If you didn't know, there is a whole application form for beta testing. Right here. I'll post it in chat. If you fill it out, then you are recorded as a response and I might call on you for a beta test. This might be the final Dory version. I will not guarantee it, but I also have not planned any changes to it. How high up in the water is Dory here? The floor is somewhat flat, so maybe we can do something like this. Yeah, we're trying not to use the modern art style. We're just trying to get the best out of the N64. 574? So it should be kind of here. So she's just going to be tied down with an anchor and going to be unable to move. And then after you beat the first Bowser level, Yoshi frees her and rides on her back. What do I think about 64DS? I hate it. Well, actually, that's a lie. I don't need it. But man, I need my analog controls, please. What's this song? This is Silly Cat music. Nah, we're not doing random stuff like that, Jordan. There is a very clear purpose to Dory being here. And that is to get you to the other side of the overworld. I remember that. I remember using that. I think Scallog sent me one like that, but I don't think he ever made it public. Probably I used someone else's. Sorry, I mean, probably the no-published one is someone else's. So I don't know if he ever made this public. I don't know what I said. Someone leveled up on YouTube chat? What the fuck does that mean? What does that mean? Me, when I level up the stairs that seem to go on forever? Ach-cha-cha, ach-cha-cha. We're in Metal Mart. I mean the song. Lame. He doesn't get it. Chat, he doesn't know. He lacks information about some obscure video game. The music from UnfunnyHowToMakeSnuffNotScaryVideo. Okay, but FNUF was never scary to begin with, unless you are like 12 years old. The only thing scary about FNUF is how fucking boring the game is. I'm sure there are some FNUF fans out there that are just offended. But genuinely, I tried playing it and there was nothing going on. And I got bored and I just walked away and just let the game play itself. And then I died like 10 minutes later. And I'm like, I survived 10 minutes doing nothing? How do people play this? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. She is chained. One week. I'm sure by Anki you don't mean me, so who is Anki and shit? I didn't clickteam, so it's a miracle I was made with how annoying clickteam fusion is. Oh? Sorry, he is going to be chained. And if you want to free her, you have to beat the first Bowser level first. Good motivation, right? This is evil, that's the point. Bowser did this. Bowser is a bad guy, bro. You're not supposed to be cheering for Bowser. I can't believe Bowser did this. He did an evil thing. No way. You know what I want to get into? I want to get into rage baiting people. But the social consequences of rage baiting people is just too much. It's like cheating at card games. I think cheating at card games would be really fun. But also, there are social consequences to it. So you can't really do it. But the minigame of trying to deceive people sounds really fun. She ended up donating to charity? That doesn't mean anything. Jeff Bezos donated to charity. You hit G three times, which disables... or enables... The fucking editing mode where the UVs move with the surface. Hello, Skyloft. I think there's a random anomaly where you're supposed to cheat. That sounds fun. I think this is how we chain her. Watching Spaceman? The speedrunner? Spaceman? Who are we talking about? A Darius game HMC? Well, there's nothing saying there's only one Darius in the Mario universe. There's multiple Darius, actually. There's a different level where multiple Darius show up, too. Spaceman 158? That's not even the Spaceman I was thinking of! Why is there so many Spacemen? Interesting space. True. Space is pretty fucking cool. If someone offered you to go on the Apollo mission to go to the moon, would you say yes? Like you'd have to go to the moon? All the way? And back? Absolutely. You need hella training. Training for what? You're sitting in, essentially, a self-driving plane. What are you going to train for? If the mission fails, you're dead. What's training going to do? Increase your survival chances from 0.1% to 0.2%? Oh yeah, you're not getting any athletic and cognitive tests. Maybe you get like a week of prepare time. And then it's off to space. We passed the cognitive test. What is 13 multiplied by 23? I actually didn't think about this. Why did Dory change up? Bowser changed her up. I don't know what I meant. Wait, so what do they test in the cognitive test? Will you go insane if we leave you in a room by yourself for a week? Okay, you don't need to know a multiplication table to do that. I'll show you how to do it. This is a math problem, this is only travel, but if you don't do it... You just go 23 multiplied by 10 equals 30, and then you... 23 multiplied by 3 equals 69, and then you get 299. It is usually that simple. Use your knowledge and problem-solving skills? It's just an environment map, and you asked me to use it quite a few times. More skills? Trigonometry? I see, trigonometry is probably useful on the space station. Okay, but you have to keep in mind, how long was the Apollo mission? Was it like a week to the moon? Wait... How long was the day to the moon? Three days? That's like just a nice vacation. Sorry isn't Shane for our crimes. Honestly, it's fucking crazy, just like three days of straight going up. And then you have to come down too, which I guess is another three days. Have you spent two hours mowing the lawn today? Should I switch to a robot mower, man? Yes! I keep telling you, get a robotic lawn mower. Why are you not listening to me? Does the Neophytics version let you use packed normals in your hack now? It does. People say like, oh well, mower is a luxury item. But really what you should be thinking about is, can you afford not to have a robotic lawn mower? Because think about all the time you lose from mowing your lawn that you could spend working. It's genuinely more expensive to not have a robotic lawn mower. You could be out there grinding, making Instagram shorts with AI. You know the ones where it's like a Reddit voice reading the fake Reddit story with Minecraft gameplay. Instead of mowing the lawn, and use that money to pay off the lawn mower. Maybe we're faster going down? That would make sense. Riding lawn mowers at the bare minimum? No, they are more expensive than robotic ones. And they make more work for you. And you have to pay money to maintain them with gas and stuff. They're just an all around worse deal. It did not break down. The robotic lawn mower remains amazing. No collision data to export? That would do it. Ruby pinging me. Hello, Stephanaurus. I'm live once a week, so you can see me working with life a lot, if you would like. It's annoying. Hello, Stephanaurus. I'm live once a week, so you can see me working with life a lot, if you would like. That's the one reason I will not get a pool. Just the running cost. Unless I am really fucking rich. If I'm ever rich, I'm getting a pool. But I need to be super rich. Actually, the first thing I would buy if I got rich is a bigger robotic lawn mower that can do my whole property. That would be so cool. Oh yeah, are you guys seeing the new water view effects? You like it? Do you like it? I fixed it. He's chained and angry. And the thing is below water. That's a problem. Below the thing. The thing is below the thing. I did say that. That's a nurse, but I don't know if you consider that rich. Maybe he's not rich, maybe he's just bad with money. You know, people that are bad with money and people that are rich, they live pretty similarly. Hello, Daily Delphox. It is Mario time. I've heard somewhere that doctors are like the people that earn the best, but also the people that are like the worst with money. I don't know if that's true, but I have heard it. Okay, Dory is completely chained. Poor Dory. How do I open the level giving menu again? Yeah, I programmed the save file editor into this thing here. And I need to give myself the Bowser level thing. So we can test if Dory gets unchained. I really don't like that Dory is chained in this game. Can you fix it? You can fix it as the player! Okay, I intended the menu to show up if you press L and R in the same frame, but it's clearly not working. That's why. Okay. I know what's wrong. Okay. So... Which one's the Bowser level? I'm just gonna give myself all these stars. You guys are complaining that I'm doing this so much? No. I definitely had dreams about coding in Mario 64, but honestly dreams are very rare for me nowadays. Okay, yeah. The save editor worked. See, Bowser is now broken. And the ghost here should now be somewhat visible. It is not. That's a problem. That's a bug for sure. And Dory is working too, in her own special way. Let's see what went wrong. Oh! Right, because I needed all the stars here. Mario's head is bouncing. So Dory's animation bugging out is entirely intentional. It's because there is no second animation here yet. That's good. That means it's all working right now. Perfect. Now for Dory, the way I had this envisioned is that once she's unbound, there is a Yoshi on her back. And the Yoshi is riding her, and she is going around here to help you go to the other side of the overworld. So we should put a location for her to hang around around. This is what I'll do. So both you and the Yoshi are riding her? Yes. You know what? We should just copy this from the normal Dory. Why the fuck not? At least she goes in circles and should have her speed up when she's not near one of your stops for convenience. Yep, she does that. Hello and Snickers. Is he hitting ROM size limit? Well, there's actually a very good reason I'm hitting ROM size limit. And that is if you look at my build folder here. So yes, the ROM in total is exactly 60 megabytes, but 46.3 of those megabytes is just sound samples. Yep, KhakiDev is right. So really there's only 13.7 megabytes of game and 46.3 megabytes of audio. Like it's all this stuff here that's taking a shit ton of data. Did we manage to compress the audio of your game? Yeah, so there is an idea to compress audio that the people in the dragon had, which I think would compress it by something like 8 nines. Right, so like an 11% reduction that would instantly get us 4 megabytes, which would be like super, super good. Alright, she is now going around. Still need to export more animations here. You know what, I'm just going to use this one animation for both actions here. Oh, she wasn't animating at all. No surprise. Yes, 4 megabytes. Well, a little more than 4 megabytes, right? You have to take 46.3 minus 46.3 multiplied by 8 divided by 9. 5.1 megabytes. If that's the compression rate. But you know what I would do with those 4 megabytes? I would just put in more music. So all you're gaining from that is like slightly better audio quality in one level. Like I am not worried about hitting the ROM limit. If we ever get close to hitting the ROM limit, I'm just going to go and reduce the sample rate of an unimportant song from 32,000 to 22,000. Or maybe transcribe a song into MIDI. Like it's just going to be a little bit more work for me or slightly lower audio quality in the final game. It is not going to be a big deal. But audio compression techniques would be the most valuable thing right now in terms of ROM size. Yeah, if we can gain those 5 megabytes without ruining the audio quality. I didn't mean to cry, but I duped this. What the fuck? Why is she stuck in the mountain? That's annoying me. She escaped the mountain, but that doesn't help her. Interesting. How come? Did I export this level? I hope I did. If not, then how is it not crashing? Nessie? I like Nessie for her. Not Doreen. That's how she's called in German, I'm pretty sure. Well, obviously the N64 can do whatever you want. This is going to take a little longer. And I don't like how this old code looks. Are we copying the move chart? We were not. Sounds like he wants you to play Mario Sunshine instead of watching the stream. Yeah, the N64 does have basically no audio hardware. She keeps staying around here. What did I do wrong? That's not even the zero point. That's just some random point here, no? Why would she be interested in this point? Yeah, true, excellent gamer, but this is still a pretty early version, so we're not trying to get the best out of the graphics. This is just a guideline for what we actually want in the end. For now, we're programming the game first, and then we're maybe prettying it up. I don't think she can long jump to begin with. I'm going to try this one more time. I can imagine that thing made some weird mistakes happen, but at the same time, I don't know. Yeah, it makes no sense to me that she's around here. Unless the randomf32around0 function broke. Thinking. So, 1.f is minus 0.5 to 0.5. Nope, this should be fine. Does she care about the target point at all, is what I wonder then. Hello, not Kevin. The BLJ works on RTYI, but there's no rumble. Yeah, I didn't remove the BLJ. It is too fun of a trick. Double promotion? Wait, what the fuck was that? Why was there a 7 in my function name? I think I was missing this include, and he just did not warn me. I can't believe it. How is it possible? Why does she care so much about the stupid rock? Will you make me bacon and egg breakfast? I know what's going on. Do you know this save block here? This save block spawns a star that's spinning inside. And this star is a behave static object, so she's finding that instead of the target point. I need to use a different dot actor. Yeah, so she was caring about that exclamation box. That makes a lot of sense. I want my breakfast, I just want to ask a really stupid question in return. I don't watch Mario 64 speedruns. This is no diss to Green Tsuji. If anything, this is a praise. But he is so good at the game, that I have trouble believing that it is possible that someone can be this good at the game. So I don't want to watch it, because I feel like 10 years down the road, people are going to be like, oh yeah, he cheated. Which I don't even know how he would do that. It's just so unbelievable that he's this good at the game, that I refuse to believe it. That's supposed to be an accusation, I'm just saying he's way too good. Is the swing thing so dumb? It's not dumb. It would be really cool if you ran it, I would definitely watch that. But no, speedrunning and watching is just, I can't do it. It's boring. Like 90% of the time. I have watched enough speedruns. Okay, next we need to make it so that Dory, when Mario is nearby, comes up to him and helps you get over there. Or maybe just like, if you aren't Dory, then Dory tries to make it so that you can get here. Alright, cock it up. Good job. Looking forward to it. The new project? You mean this one here? I guess it is going to be new once it's finally done. Okay, I might have forgotten to export the level. Yeah, she's not swimming in water, she's swimming in science soup. Special thing Boza put in here to keep her happy. I've only written about it, it's the app that I'm running on Mipsmart, it's true. RTYI is now like 5 years in development I think. It is a pretty big game now, so I don't feel bad about that. Okay, maybe she shouldn't be doing this. I should probably stop spinning once she's nearby enough. And maybe I can lower the water a little bit. The data leaked from Mario 64 to help the engine development? Definitely not, I never even looked at it. It is entirely useless. Like, okay, you need to realize, the code that Nintendo wrote for Mario 64 is abysmal garbage. So leaked code that didn't even make it into the final game would be even more abysmal garbage. So like, you definitely wouldn't want to touch it. The survival of the same code except all the names suck? Yeah. Why were we not receiving inherited velocity on here? Wait a second, we ran this function twice. Not 1000, but maybe 658? I'm actually thinking of adding collision BVH to the engine, which would improve collision functions a fair bit. I think that is a pretty exciting prospect for the future. Right now it uses the cell lookup thing. But I think BVH would make the whole collision a little bit faster. That actually looks so much better. Wait, I like this so much more. What about some of the BVH? Mario 64 currently uses cells, and I'm thinking of moving to BVH. I already have stuff planned out for it, how I want the BVH cells to look and stuff like that. Sir Boo theme level? There is a ghost level. Not around Boos, but around Shy Guys. Can I tell you something like that a million years ago? You told me to do array collision, which was a terrible idea. But if you want to help with BVH, I definitely need people to help me with the makefile. Well, I don't need people, but I would appreciate people to help me with that. Collision mitigation at build time instead of run time? That's a bad idea. So you can make it more advanced? Okay, that's a good idea. But honestly, we can generate it at run time and make it more complex. Because our load times are so small, it doesn't really matter. But yes, I would probably generate the BVH at build time, just because a good BVH is very expensive to generate. Which is going to cost a good bit more ROM, which is a problem. It costs extra memory. That's the issue. ROM. We are kind of bottlenecked on ROM space. We don't want to waste any ROM space. I don't know about that. I think for collision BVH, I calculated it something like a megabyte. But I guess we can compress that still. Amazement RAM space. We still have quite a bit of RAM space. But our RAM is weirdly partitioned. I'm actually making a video right now about how much RAM Mario 64 really needed. Guess in chat how much RAM did you need to run Mario 64 on the Nintendo 64 in 1996? Give me a number in megabyte. It currently uses exactly 4 megabytes. 2 megabytes, 2 kilobytes, 2 to 3 megabytes, 1 megabyte? I almost said 4 megabyte. But I mean, for Mario 64, that's true. But yeah, it is around 2 megabytes. So around half of the RAM it actually used. I don't know. I don't understand how they ran by fitting the ROM in there too. Oh god. Honestly? In 8 megabytes? We can do that. I mean, of course, in 8 megabytes it's actually pretty easy. In 4 megabytes? I... I don't want to say it's impossible. But I have my doubts about it being possible. Also, hello, Thara. Great to see you here. So she should be turning to the left as soon as she gets close enough. Actually, she shouldn't because I made a stupid mistake. Oh, she does turn. Actually, that makes sense. Perfect. Story delivery complete. I just use all eight megabytes. The thing is, so the RAM in Return to Useless Island, the thing about RAM is the RAM has eight segments that are each one megabyte and if you access them in parallel you get slightly faster access. So I have like the Z-buffer in segment zero and then a frame buffer in segment four and then one in five and one in six and one in seven so that my RAM is like completely split up, very fragmented. And then between the frame buffer and Z-buffers I store data. You could of course compress it but you would lose maybe five percent of performance so we do not want that. Think of angles and hacks is crazy. Your name is Crack Hacks, what do you mean? You better think of angles and hacks. Anyway, next what we need is a Yoshi on her back that if you talk to it tells you about how he freed Yoshi, freed Dory with his mighty behind after Bowser was beaten. Ah, I almost diluted my entire course. 0xf7 makes sense. Do you have every colored Yoshi like in the game or in real life? Because the answer is yes for both. We have a couple baby Yoshis but not very many. There's one baby Yoshi that sits on your head and yeah it's like a grappling hook and like a mini level. The Yoshis have different powers in Mario World? I was not aware of that. So hello Chania Retro Computer Gaming. I'm coming with VS Codes. I'm not very committed to VS Codes. This is just inertia from using it already. Although I do not know about R2-R2 anyway. 296 so oh I thought all of them were fire-breathing. Damage when jumps blue Yoshi gets wings and you can fly with it. Yoshi has fireballs and blue Yoshi does everything that the other ones do. Ah, so blue Yoshi is just the bad one, the best one. I do not like slings. So we have a generic function for talking to Mario, do we? No, we don't. This is a generic function for offering a trade. We should make a generic talking function as well. Wait, we have that. It's just this part. So let's see if that works. That's the dialogue that pops up if you're trying to accept the trade but don't have the money to accept the trade. So okay he is not sitting as intended. This is an actual Yoshi villager and not the Dory Rider that I copied the wrong movie here. Ah, it is not. How is this possible? Oh, we don't actually copy the positions. That would do it. There was a banger optimization I tried yesterday that unfortunately didn't work, which I'm very sad about. And I'm actually not entirely sure why it didn't work, because logically to me it sounded like it should be working. So you know how you need to clear the Z-buffer before you can start rendering? Most of the time the RDP does it. The RDP writes a color image that's like the whole pixel. All of them are just like maximum depth so that the next frame you draw it just draws over. And the suggestion was to split it up so the RSP does like half of it and the RDP does the other half of it or some percentage. So here I wrote code that makes the RSP do less and less of the work and the RDP more and more. But clearly, like if you look at the microsecond counter here, it just goes straight down. The more work I made the RSP do, the worse it got. Which doesn't make any sense to me. I thought for sure the RSP clearing a little bit would help a small bit, but no. Straight up we just need the RSP performance at the beginning of a frame. Yes, this will be open source when it releases. This hitbox is too big. It doesn't make any sense though, the RSP being busy. I don't know. I'm still thinking I did something wrong, but I'm not sure. Of course, the question is, why would... I mean, I guess it could be true that like literally any bandwidth the RSP uses the RDP can't use. But I thought like while the RDP is drawing the pixels, the RSP can maybe slightly earlier take over the memory bus and like get an extra line in every now and then, but apparently not. So this is not a SID animation. Oh, because we didn't actually put the SID animation in. What's it for? Zero, one, two, three, four. It needs a different color. Well, the RDP and the RSP always work together, but I had them work together on the same task basically, just different parts of it. Right, think about like... Think about washing machines and doing your clothes. Maybe you need more than one load of laundry, but maybe you also have more than one washing machine. I wasn't sure how many washing machines I had basically, but turns out apparently I only have one. We need more Yoshi colors. Okay, what color do we give the rider? So we don't actually know 100%, but it is slower in my case, is the infuriating part. So somehow, what must be going on, what I'm imagining here is that the RSP, because it is clearing the Z-buffer, can't start other tasks, or maybe because we're also sending the RSP clear comments, somehow we're using more memory traffic. I mean, I heard it helps in Zelda, so it not helping in this game is kind of extremely sad. But also, I don't clear the frame buffer, so I think that is the relevant difference. I imagine what they're doing in OOT is the RDP clears the frame buffer, while the RSP clears the Z-buffer. And because I don't clear the frame buffer, it just doesn't help in my case, I think. It's the only explanation I have. That's... dude, I said the same thing. I looked at the loggering up time, I'm like, how is this not 60 FPS? How is this 30? This should be a 60 game. It seems so much easier to draw than Mario 64, like, most of the time. If you look at Hyrule Field, like, really, what's going on in Hyrule Field? How about... oh no, we want them to kind of contrast with the Dory. How about this color for him? Maybe something more saturated. This? Maybe a darker one? I'm sure it could run at 30 if you optimized it a little bit. 22, 1, 0, 19. 19? Is this 19? Yeah, he is correct about that. No, it's not gonna be as Mario in that. That isn't an enormous... oh, that's surprising. I would think that's like, probably at least 1.5 milliseconds of RDP time. Did I... I did not compile the game. Undefined reference to... oh. Undefined reference to... oh. Because I'm renaming Mario 64 functions to fit with my new coding guidelines. Yes, drawing the skybox should work as a framework for clear. That's kind of what I'm doing. If you look at this stage here, so what's going on is below the horizon line, just slightly below, it stops. So like, only the top 60% of the screen here actually has the framebuffer cleared. The bottom 40% doesn't have the framebuffer cleared. We just clear the Z-buffer and then demand that the game has watertight geometry in a way where it overrides the full pixel buffer. That way you can stop clearing half the framebuffer, which is helping performance a lot. But it also means, like... Oh, nevermind, this is... the skybox doesn't have this optimization yet. But if the skybox had that optimization and you did something like that, you would see a whole lot of mirror effect here. Ah, okay, that makes sense. From what Wiseguy showed me of Ocarina of Time, it looked like there's some serious inefficiency going on on the CPU to the point where, like, that's probably causing issues. Yo, why... Yo, bro, bro! You're clipping out of render. And I know why. Let's fix that. I was able to save about 8ms of video by fixing the app condition. Holy shit, that is really bad. Sorry. Wow! Okay, but, like, I mean, I hope we all just agree about this, like, the more you clean up the CPU, the better the RDP performance also gets. Because I've had insane success just cleaning up CPU and getting slightly better RDP performance as a result. For some of the Helm Rook bugs, like, talk about it as though they are separate things. But on the N64, they're so close together, you can't really separate them. I measure CPU performance improvements in RDP time. That's how little I care about CPU. I mean, actually, can I show this right now? Let me see. Oh, it takes, like, 14 seconds for the profiler. The profiler averages 800 ticks. So the profiler takes a little bit to get going. And also, I probably waste, like, 2ms on just the profiler. But if you look at this, man, like, this is with infinite drawing distance. You can see the enemies right to your move all the way over here. Those four pixels. And still, we get, like, 8ms of CPU time. Well, all combined together, that's, like, 10ms. Without the profiler, it would probably be, like, 7ms or 8ms. And 8ms of idle time. 8ms of idle time. So even with something ridiculous, like unlimited drawing distance, computing animations all the way over here, you get nowhere near the CPU limit. For that reason, I'm just saying, like, the CPU is completely irrelevant. I do not care about the CPU cycle at all. I only care about its RDP impact. So... You can turn AA on. It does cost a little bit of FPS. It is true that the first level is a lot smaller than the others. So I didn't really like the color of this Yoshi. He didn't really look like this. Oh, I know why. I think this still is the color. If enemies are using the flight contact switches, I feel like it can be sped up a bunch. Definitely, definitely. So I am not a fan of this Yoshi. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. I am planning to do that. Currently, DeathWizard is working on a complete replacement for Libultra. So I want to wait until he's done with that. And then the plans I have is an OS running thread. It's just going to be stored on K0 permanently. It's never going to be off. All registers are going to be assumed to be 32-bit. 64-bit is going to be entirely gone. We just have a 32-bit OS. Um, there's a couple more things. But those are the big ones. I also, like, killed probably 80% of Libultra codes. I have a node on here that's... Oh, right. And there's a few registers like GP, K0, something versus 8. Cache invalidation for thread switching? Definitely. We need to do hit invalidate. Fuck. What's the... Create directory exclusive. That one. Also, this is a crazy one. Instead of a stack during the OS, I just want to have a fake stack with create directory exclusive. Just use the cache as a stack to bypass memory entirely. Oh yeah, there's a few threads that don't use FPU, like the idle thread. I mean, the idle thread, we can just make it not do any floating point stuff at all, right? All right, he looks kind of nice. Did I say that Mario Galaxy 64 finally came out? I did not. We still need to import Biobank's new Yoshi, I think, right? Is this the same guy? This is not the same guy. Look at this. This new guy will look a lot nicer. Let's see if it just works. Right, so this is a 5.64 issue where you can't put the GeoASM at the beginning, so we need to manually just do this. The glasses, there's going to be one special Yoshi with glasses. Um, basically there's going to be, I think, 10 special colored Yoshi. Then if you talk to them, they give you a special mission. They kind of work like the green stars in Mario Galaxy. Oh my god, he immediately looks so much more legit. Look at this. What a crazy difference. Although there is a weird dark part behind him here. What's that about? They all set primitive color. This is a big problem. So. We can be using primitive color here, I think. Oh, well, we can be using primitive color, but not like that. Okay. So. This is fine. And then this function here needs to instead push a primitive color instead of this. So. I think two zeros at once. Oops. That worked. Nice. Am I just being used for color palette at this project? Um, that question means nothing to me. I don't understand. We're using all the colors. All right, Joshua's dark spot is gone, and he's using the correct colors. He looks so good, man. I love him. Now he just needs his own text box. Question, is this jump easy enough? I'm worried that people will have trouble with it. We could lower it a little bit. We should lower it a little bit. Ah, maybe this is better. So. Are there moves in this game? Yes, there are more moves in this game than Mario 64. Just like the ground pound dive and Mario's down B from Super Smash Bros Melee. So. And of course, the ground pound jump. So. We still need to make a decent forest here. We definitely cannot have this be in the final game. So. Does he have the same down B in Smash 64? No way. If he has that same down B in Smash 64, that is even better. Because then I can be like, yeah, that's an N64 error thing. Look it up, nerd. Why are you coming at me? That would honestly make my game slightly better. How's Mario 64 Mario sticking to moving platforms? Matrix transformations. So. Isn't the ground pound dive kind of irrelevant considering you can just hit A, B, N, E, H, I, J, C, D, E? No. No, no, no, no, no. The ground pound dive is, um... You kind of stop in midair. Look at this, you can do this. And stop a run. Or you can do this to get started earlier. There is a usage to it. But maybe the usage eludes the average user. But yes, you can also just hit B and get something similar looking. The flat spray is a crime, man. How did they do that to Mario in Smash Bros.? Oh, that actually looks a lot better with Ori now. Yes, you can BLJ. My one worry is that you can somehow get up here without Dory. But I don't see how. Oh, that looks so close. Oh, wait, I think this is possible. Yeah, it's not possible. All right, this is done. Oh yeah, it is in the stone air now. Don't worry about allow for speedrun. I don't want to allow obvious skips in the speedrun. If there is a skip in the game, I'm fine with it. I'm not gonna cry over it. But at least you need to work for it. You need to do something that they didn't foresee. So, let me see what's seen from above. Yep, this is probably the biggest overworld in a Mario game ever. But I think it will be worth it. The overworld itself is like two courses. There is probably around 20 stars in here. I actually love this overworld. The way we did this overworld has some really cool stuff. Okay, I don't know what was going on there. Anyway, one thing I like a lot about the world is when you first get here, you see this lighthouse and the volcano. And you have like no way of going there. But then after you play through the game a little bit, you get around here, you get around here, you get around here, you find the cave, you go through the cave, you come out on the other side of the cave, and now you're by the lighthouse. How cool is that? You were teased about this from the get-go. And the volcano too. You can get into the volcano actually and go into the volcano. I want the whole overworld to just feel like a place in the end. Anyway, time for prod 3. Oh, we need to program the lighthouse here too. I did not export. Yeah, the overworld of this game is actually almost kind of like a Zelda game in a way. How did you manage to render the coins in-game? They are 2D view bits or 3D models? They are 2D billboards. A lot of people think they're 3D models, but they are not. So we can arise the final level. Nope. They don't have pallets. There's also stuff like the star over there. You see this like from the beginning of the game, but you can't reach it until after you beat the first puzzle level. Okay, so this overworld is fucking lame actually. One cool thing I want to do with these swings is, I want to put Yoshis on it after you beat the first puzzle level. Rayyan made these by the way. Very nice. There has to be a BLJ here. Huh. Maybe it's not that easy to BLJ. Hmm. So there was planned to be one mission here where you collect, I think, silver stars before a timer runs out. I'm not sure I actually like this game. It's pretty nice. I mean some of the puzzles are nice like the watermelon and the grapes, but the strawberries look really poopy. There's four power-ups in the game and three of them are new. Yeah, we need to do something about how empty the little area is. I can't have that in the game. So, this feels pretty fun. And then from here you see Intercourse 3. Do you see that? That's where Intercourse 3 is. But in Intercourse 3 you only see the other side and like it's mirrored. So this is like a one-way mirror. They are like the Wingham. They're all timer-based. Well, actually two of them are timer-based and then two of them are ammunition-based. Anyway, let's think about how to reduce the empty space here. We also have to go through the boardwalk here. Where the fuck comes up as you go? The zipline has progressive speed and resistance. All right, and there's a clam puzzle here where it's like someone gives you instructions. On how to get the thing. Then you have to follow them. A Yoshi smoothie shop? What would that do? Nothing? Like the tea shops in Origami King? Where everyone's just yapping? Wait, there could be a smoothie shop that gives you like a hint on how to get one of the mini-games. The way it works in Origami King is you can like order a tea and then there's like locals that talk and usually they have like a hint on how to find the secret item. That would kind of work. Valoigi is in this game. He is in Vario's Wildlife World in the level. And he's refusing to sell you a taco. That's all he does. And you can break his furniture. We have this. We have this. And we have this. We don't have a pepper but we have the orange. Okay but this is still empty. This is not good. Also when I went in there just now I did not see the cave to the level five. Let me see if that's obvious or not. Okay yeah if you missed that that's kind of on your own fault. Uh currently there's 193 stars planned but obviously we're not going to end it with 193. That'd be a weird number. So it might turn out 190, 195 or 200. Okay that looks good enough. The way this is going to work is if you go in here you will just be whopped out. I think you need to program that actually. Actually the sign needs to change. This level is no longer called Big Boo's Cruise. It's called Rouga Galleon. Also this material is missing the fork. 165. It probably was 165 at some point. But things change. So I have seen that. Well I don't know how it works but I have seen some scattershot runs. Did you make that sign? Maybe. So Hm. So this cliff is fine. This part is not fine at all. Let's see. Are there any events we have planned for here? This one. The Boobla infestation. We need to program that. Bone Dragon. Part 4 cave. The zoo. Is this because a new level was designed? We suddenly need one single star for 1000 coins. Is it star 165DS? Yes I know what that is. I am familiar with Skellogs. He used to be a Mario 64 hacker. Time Red Coin. Well this should be a silver star. Let's make the boost to the Mario World star with a fork. No we are not randomly mixing stars like that. We didn't make the sandbucket that he gets married to. I just realized. Beautiful pile of silly gates. We need to program that star. Part 3 message in a bottle to find the ice cap. No star spawns under 10 stars. Yeah actually we kind of need this. We need to gather everything I need to program here. What are you listening to? We are listening to Ultimate Silly Playlist for Boost Energy. The start of the stream I just put in silly cat music and then auto-played it. The beginners in this game. There will be Yoshi stars. They kind of function like green stars but they aren't really. Honestly there are not even boosts in this game Jordan. Except for Boon Art and Boa Trees which both kind of just have their own design. Well there will be a green Yoshi and he will give you Yoshi stars. But they are not gonna function like green stars. But there are boosts. What about Boa Trees and Boon Art? Don't forget those two. Daily doubles. You're gonna love Boa Trees and Boon Art. Look at this right here. You see this very transparent thing? That's Boa Trees. That's Boon Art's wife. She is very shy. She's shy because the robot's looking at her. So you need to free her. And you can talk to her husband on course three. Which is right here. He said he's missing his wife. He wants her to come home. Doesn't give you any star for bringing her home. But it's like a cute little thing that happens. That you can engage with. How good is Boon Art? I think you will love Boon Art. Boon Art's like an old man. He just lives in his shack. He doesn't want to do anything except drink tea, fill out his taxes and live in peace. He is very old. Dealing your taxes is honestly not as bad as everyone said. I don't know why people bitch about it. Maybe I'm also old. I don't know. What's so funny about the clip? The fact that music. Is that the funny part? YouTube was like, ah, we found the copyright thing here. You might want to replace that music. And I'm like, okay. Fucking give me clown music then. And then when it inserted the music, instead of inserting the music normally, it fucked up my voice and inserted the music so loud. It's like, all right, well, fuck it. I guess that's the clip for today. Have you heard of clowncore? I have not. He listened to sad clowncore. That kid was probably extremely based. You should have befriended them. Or her. It can be a girl too. Although given the fact that this kid listened to sad clowncore, I am here for my assumptions. You know what? It's not clowncore famous. Let's find out what this is. So. This is sad clowncore. This is 100% all AI, is it not? Okay, I'm done with sad clowncore. That is a gigantic banana, yes. Bro, I think your classmate just listened to fucking AI music all day. If he said sad clowncore. What the hell are you playing? This is a secret level that you can unlock in Mario 64 if you ground pound the moat outside the castle 120 times. But you need to be fast. You need to do it under five minutes. Otherwise it's not gonna unlock. Did you try anything strawberry that big? Yes, I actually preferred the bigger strawberries. How long do you think it would take me to eat that? Yeah. So we're going to put two Yoshis on the swing here at some point. I think I want there to be something here. So it's an Ultra Dad. Throw the real descent in a little bit. Also there's no grape here. Where did the two grapes go? I don't think I exported this. I think something went wrong. Yeah, I see what you mean, Daily Delphox. This level was started long before DK Bonanza came out. So it gives you those vibes. Then they took that from me. They saw what I was doing and were like, quick, make a video game before he does. Let me cut the banana in half to wall jump in between. That's kind of a banger idea. That idea is kind of cooking. Yeah, we can add more plants, vegetation and stuff. This is not supposed to be like a final art pass anyway. This is just like to get the gameplay done for the overworld. It just needs to look acceptable right now. Makes the platforming a bit easier. Oh, Daily Delphox, I forgot about that. I'm a shame to my family. I'm a genuine mentor. I don't care. It sounds like a stupid joke. Why would you? I mean, that's what beta testing is for. I actually think my experience is kind of the opposite. That beta testing is almost used as a crutch. Like, not even being tried to get it right the first time. Or to like, get useful data. Just like, make a thing, just shit something together and then throw beta testing at it. And then you make the minimum change needed to frustration minimize it. And I hate that style. I use Windows 11. Well, it's still a horrible level right now. So that's not good. We could probably improve this a fair bit. If we made the grass go up into here. So... Damn. Well, we don't want that. So... Ah! How are you feeling about this? Much more colorful, right? It should be a little better. I think the ocean with the fruits is not that plain though. I mean, once we have the water animated properly, maybe it will be a bit better. But we'll see. We'll see what we can do. Let me first take in the scenery. You can swim in the water further away. That could help. We need a few of those anyway. Oh yeah, this feels so much nicer to me right now already. Well, okay, once we have the water animated here, I think this is going to be a lot better. Trees for sure, trees. There won't be palm trees here. Pearl also for sure. Fishes, all that good stuff. I still need to add seagulls actually. All right, so okay, next step is... I forget palm trees. I know, I've definitely embraced that version 1 of whatever demo I'll make will be kind of bad. So I know that when I send a beta test build until I'm like 50% done with beta testing, I imagine they will run into like really frustrating issues. Or sometimes I even purposely like do experimental designs where I'm not certain that they will work. And then like 90% of the time it won't work, but then like 10% of the time it does work. That's where the magic happens. Okay, that didn't work, cool. Let's try that again. I love how you increase the emotional attachment to Dory. Yes, Dory is great, we love Dory in here. Dory is somehow one of the most popular Mario 64 characters in the community, despite it feeling like Nintendo doesn't care about her at all. They struck gold and they just threw it away. How do I not get banned? Well not like that, Mott kills him. Just kidding. You're gonna fail to emotionally grip the player with Dory. The player has given Dory to Zoey since they don't know her. She needs to do something nice to the player before being trapped to invest the player. But she's stuck. How's she gonna do something nice? Honestly, if you really wanted to do that, we could have her save Mario during the intro cutscene. Just during the intro cutscene Mario's boat crashes. Dory saving you, honestly, would be kind of crazy. Okay, let's return to Yoshi's Island 64. We could definitely make Dory save the player. I've read somewhere that dinosaurs are not actually the source of fossil fuels. Is that true? Is it actually all just all trees? Have we been lied to? Or have I been lied to just recently? Yeah, this already looks a lot more juicy. Way better than before. So Biomass and there's a lot more plant-based biomass than animal-based. Yeah, that makes sense. That's between the corals, maybe. It seems like too difficult of a jump. So, we are going to add a silver coin switch somewhere in here. And ideally, you'd be able to get all the silver coins by just platforming over these fruits. So we could put the switch on here and then one silver coin on each strawberry and one silver star. One, two, three. And then one on the apple. Four. And then one on the watermelon. Five. Or if we really wanted, we could only add two on the strawberries. And then number five is over here. I think that would work pretty well. I think, yeah, that's a good silver star. I'm going to save it. I think three strawberries is fine. You buy strawberries in bundles. Oh yeah, we should have beach towels that were left behind and sandcastles. I'm going to add that to the list here. Beach towels that were left behind and sandcastles. Sounds good, Zainab. I'm not sure about parasols. Maybe you could have parasols that you can bounce on. Let's add that to this too. Although we already used that in a different course as a mechanic, so maybe not. Beach chairs? Nah, we got towels. They're Yoshis. They're two primitive chairs. I think the solution is to move the grape, not rotate the apple. But yeah, we still have to fine-tune the placement of things a little bit. I don't like that I have two copies of the silver star switch in different courses, but I think it has to be this way. Unfortunate. Well, actually, I can try to remedy that by loading the overworld bank in this course. I do not care. It's fine. It will be fine, I hope. These are terrible expert settings. I don't have to move them, it just makes my life a lot easier. I don't have to move them, it just makes my life a lot easier. It is a bad practice to do it this way, but it makes my life so much easier. So we might just have to deal with that. You forget crabs? Yes, I didn't add any crabs yet. Fine, I'll add crabs. Although this is the Yoshi side of things, so we're probably adding less crabs than the rest of the world. This is a more civilized place. I'm getting free. I'm not happy about this. I just have to make sure everyone knows that. When I think about it, will there be fishes in the water? Yes. I just haven't added any yet. I usually do environment stuff like that at the end. I can make a very basic video game, but I have never done any development for any idea what engine I should use. No, not really. It doesn't really matter, I think. I don't think I will ever make a big Moriac that doesn't work on console again. That just doesn't seem to be a point. Why would I make it not work on console? This should be star ID 1, I think. We should make a table for that. Oh, we have one. Good thinking. You're thinking about if it works on console on average, how hard is it to go back on instant to get it to work on console? It should be fairly easy. I mean, if you base it on my engine, I think it will most likely already mostly work on console. That's true, Eddie. That's just because they were made on such old tools. If they were made with modern tools, they would work on console, but probably the Dianodoxy creatures, probably not. Oh my god, Mobs is so far behind on stream. Now he's talking about Clown Core. We moved on from that like two hours ago. Where's the ticking? Why is it not ticking? Hmm, now it's gone. And it didn't come back up. Damn, there's some issues. It didn't... What could that mean? I don't know when you really think I'm right. Yes, you are correct. I will make my engine public. Ideally, this will allow other people to contribute to it as well and maybe find performance or stability improvements. They usually don't have a coin floating on it. That's just a Romhack thing that they made because they just didn't know how to make Invisible Secrets work. But I think Invisible Secrets have a lot of potential. They can be very fun. They're just done pulling so much that they got a bad rep for it. So Damn, definitely needs more time. So There's no way to increase the time here. Okay, that's problematic. So Let's do that and just give it four more seconds, eight more seconds. Let's see. Hello, Blue Harvey. How are those two signouts looking? They're not being made by yourself. Why does it need a timer? Because it's a Silver Star machine without a timer. It's boring. The side level Marty is working on looks amazing. The side level Isa is working on looks okay, but I think he's not working on it anymore. He kinda didn't put in the work I hoped he would. So I'm not sure if I can use it or when I can get to it or if I can use it. Let's see. So I'll definitely make all these sprues climbable in the end, by the way, so you're not gonna have the problem that Mario will slip and slide all over the place. So it is possible now, but it's still way too tight. Peach's Fury is a very different game. Whoa, I don't like that. Three more seconds. I was thinking eight more seconds. Let's increase it by eight and beat this as slow as like a complete noob would. Jordan, I think we'll be held to a much higher standard than the vanilla Mario 64 game, so we cannot make bullshit stars like that. The climate around video games has changed a lot since then. Back then, you could make bullshit and people had only one video game to play, so they were like, well, I guess I'm gonna spend all my afternoon solving this bullshit. But now people don't do that. They're like, this fucking sucks. Why would I play this? I'll just complain online or find a solution online or play something else, because you know, I didn't pay any money for this. I'm not very committed to this. I'm not very committed to this. Okay, I don't like the shadow here. So we'll do that. So now they should have the shadow in the background as they move. Kinda Zim Zim, yeah? That's not wrong. So right now I'm trying to beat this slowly to see how this would play out for a bad player. Maybe they even miss this jump here. Do you think that's slow enough? I think maybe that's enough time. Like, I played that fully on purpose and I still kinda made it. With about a second to spare. I think it works. I think we can consider this done. So did I not have this written down? Well, there we go. One or two more seconds. I think it's... I mean, this is what beta testing is for, genuinely. This is like, okay, well, if the people can't do this well enough in the beta test, we'll add a second or two more. But for now I'm feeling comfortable with this time limit. And if it's actually bad, then during testing I'll just add a second or two more. I don't think I want the pepper actually. All right, good progress. I think next time we work on this we might have to already program the lighthouse, which means I also have to do the inside of the lighthouse, because I forgot to do that actually the first time around. So yes, I think I'm done for today and I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye-bye!
