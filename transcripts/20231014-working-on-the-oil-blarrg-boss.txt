Hi so I've got new recording settings hopefully everything's a little bit better now chop-chop streamer boy chop-chop chatter boy woman girl female Lilaa okay the reason I was slightly late is because when I click start streaming in OBS it takes like half a minute until I'm actually live my old stream is lagging there we go we're moving into our new house next week and I got a job I got a new job as a 3d modeler for for the government kind of it's not for a government stop saying that that's nice you're asking about the house but also what it's interested a sign conference is a common variable for the no you like star select sure buddy once we got today so I did this and they're all in cages now and Mario's blah blah blah when he falls I also improved the auto-focus a little bit and no longer focuses it as aggressively so if you want to look around the room you could more of them holy shit that's cool the wave looks weird I feel like the text should scroll better but somehow the tile scroll doesn't work I haven't done any lighting here yet why what's okay cuz the Blargg is really really dark right now it's a little hard to do sometimes Mario just falls through these and just dies this makes the boss fight kind of difficult right now and this is cool oh yeah I also want to remove this I just realized I want to remove this is that I feel like this would be better if it was just removed and just like oh you just did the thing the others are insane all right points here should definitely a pointer issue I figured out how to edge chat to screen on YouTube nope never when I'd scale the wave exponentially small small small small smaller than giant huh what's the exponent here I am very confused either I'm not scaling down oh you mean at the end does it not oh I guess I can't get an exponentially oh but then it's fastest at the beginning and slowest at the end that's stupid only at the end it looks kind of weird okay why not just do something like this then let's see how that looks the second level has some rough performance was it always like that nope that's your PC 64 and should have no performance issues nothing I do and that is very expensive to do yeah so the whole oh whoops okay it's a bit too big what did I see is fixed yes still only not scaling down at the end oh you wanted to always scale down I see what you want now dude this buck is actually like so annoying but that's actually a really good buck to know about because that gives me a very good hint as to what's wrong I'm getting a new controller I see why you a parallel you can't get it to work anymore welcome to my mine for mining diamonds I don't think I wanted to always kill dolly now I gameplay wise it needs to be big enough to hit you let's think of a response please it takes three cycles in to get the same coefficients in which you know it kind of sucks but it doesn't take a single rem ss so it doesn't really matter yes we're getting them a bunch of times but as soon as we switch to Katerinian animations it's gonna be a lot less relevant it's gonna be per object we get the coefficients I guess we still get them like 600 times a frame I guess that's kind of big but usually the reason we have a coefficient in a register it's not to reduce the cycle count it's to reduce the memory count and because they're just two cycles every time it's like a thousand two hundred cycles or something who cares they were in the data section they're not I put them into graph render I can show you yeah see it's actually only one coefficient to any OSTs for today senior star section to import all right we'll get started with that KWC I hate that that's the acronym for Cooper wave Cove you might have to do a bunch of custom code for these video I'm sorry but it's for the good cause that is all all fine Racing Lagoon I'd like to listen to an OST that someone know okay so how does this work it's the same as course one just like scrolling along that's easy to do almost got crazy Cooper Carnival it's a good thing I noticed that that's not a good abbreviation all right we need an OST though Mario Party Mario Kart Mario I don't know Oh origami king let's do it origami king actually has a dude I remember thinking about origami king dude the artists are so great the music is so great it's a shame that the game designers on this game are trash like poor dudes let me make sure all the materials are fine that is what I feared are they like this in Cooper wave Cove as well god I hope not you you know it's also good if you don't mind listening to the same melody for three hours Oh nth color what's with anchor pimp color wait half of these have fuck and the other half loans that's not good are they supposed to fuck bio back no they're not okay because some of these have fuck and others don't okay in that case let's do this again I don't why can I not why can I not select some of this okay so this is fine oh you can't have nth color in here yeah yeah definitely can't have nth color and this one needs to be no up and opaque the problem with having nth color set on emulator sometimes they will just go invisible if you do that and we don't want these to go invisible I think opinion on paper Mario 64 I do not remember what is paper Mario 64 and what is origami King and what is TTYD they just blend together into the same game to me okay so this one has fuck applied I'm guessing this is not supposed to have fuck I'm present when I say it's done like 75 or something oh guys I have banger news Arctic realized yesterday that his tool strm 64 has some cool properties that allow us to save 1.7 megabytes of ROM space apparently there were a few songs in RTUI that they kept going after the loop point and we didn't need that at all so Arctic still saved a few megabytes here and there which means we are allowed to have more streamed music than we thought they're not done in their random order it's basically just whatever Biobak feels like making first gets made first you now to add mp3 recording sure I hope these all render and like full 60 FPS on n64 if not we might have to slightly optimize this this right now is like on optimized garbage strictly speaking what is this zero faces four inches I guess we don't oh shit we do need that weird yeah yeah they don't need to be optimized there's also like a bunch of combiners that I didn't optimize here technically like if we did want this to be optimized we could just kind of like have to draw order be rigid and if none of them actually use any buffers or whatever or like the backside of the houses like we don't need them I'm assuming we don't need them unless you have some sort of crazy animation plant I'm just gonna remove these to save some that shouldn't do it that saves 80 triangles so if you need you could make a more carnivals themed after like the free right cue or something oh that's funny why is the floor subdivided like that for its colors I'm guessing 50 by it seems it's not a lot but it's free so why one way same here it's all hidden sneaky triangles true he's sneaking them in eventually someone's gonna have like a free camera mo attack in this game and they're gonna like sneak around and they will see so many of biomex in triangles he's gonna have like hidden penis drawn on here somewhere material 0 0 1 as an issue oh that's clearly an i8 already exported yes I will program it in that you will just get a stroke if you watch it if you don't get this up close I am capable of doing that so don't fuck with my game for it's 9 it's basically the same function isn't it IRL brain RAM values yes all right Lilaa I'll edit it again good suggestion I won't read that's cocky don't worry that's like a thing I will add but it will just be rapping at you it's like resetting can you have a basic screen function yes that is likely what I will do I am writing some mysterious codes to half of you guys you don't know what's up hello hans wurst why are you tilting your variables with the present occurrence i am wrong and see but shouldn't you use to know it shouldn't there's there's no advantage or disadvantage to doing it either way if anyone tells you you should do in a certain way they are 100% guarantee the fucking idiot let's make sure the background corresponds to renders fine and then use this one okay so who decides that that's an arbitrary rule there's no advantage or disadvantage to this but it is not okay there's still no reason for this okay this still has to fade an animation by a bag do you want that but it's a standard okay there's different standards like in epic games and back in these games everything uses the capitalization i put here i'm not trying to be right i just am right you can take it out this time all right does rom size affect n64 compatibility theoretically yes but we're not gonna go with that they can do rom size anyway spouse's comedy club and cooper got old still a thing it's not gonna be a comedy club that's spouse's magic show and yes it's still gonna be a thing okay guys i will explain to you why pascal case or snake case or camera case or whatever the fuck doesn't matter because okay first of all your function is yellow you have an ide the function is yellow all right you don't need the casing of the variable or function name to indicate what it is because it's fucking yellow does the event on jank center yes but basically every text editor has a feature like that counterpoint kind of blindness counter counterpoint change the colors to colors you can see it's not kind of when i use get defensively i think it's colored here um all right and get up desktop this is a bit scary okay my repo doesn't exist anymore don't mind i can't show you to get this oh that looks nice what do you guys say wrong level though that's honestly a good point yes okay the next sticker well at least the yoshi part of the next sticker is done oh okay where's koopa with kove what the fuck is wrong with me koopa carnival where is koopa with kove there we go which one was this course e12 oh it's gonna be wait what should i list this okay works for me for now i need parameter scroll speed wait what that is an unused parameter yeah we swapped them hello clayman move the text down a little it's not centered i sent you the sketch oh let's see it so they're not making new new stuff this is gonna be the skill issue or she was it just program just program will yoshi the skill um hold okay let me see what Biobak means by move the text down it's not centered here we go and we have i don't really like the background for it just yet it's not finished but yeah the text space is not optimized really yeah it's a bit not elegant but yeah but i think once all the yoshis are done i want to do four and make it into like a little sticker pack all right so i think the next one is gonna be going hey i don't know should it be yellow or should it be red i don't care it could be orange also chat i need a list of famous case of cases infant most infamous quotes like something i can use for a sticker pack oh you made this the exact same size Biobak that makes stuff easier chocolate chicken you see how there's more space at the bottom than the top oh you are thinking of like it's not centered vertically because okay i see i see i see what what what what what just happened oh my god Biobak please send please send them to me you have a list of case quotes oh no this man what's he doing to me is he keeping tabs on me am i gonna be oh i could make more than four stickers with this if there's some really good ones i do not know of a cigarette quote never out of one every time you say dumb shit oh no Biobak has us covered oh no it's gonna make a whole video just exposing me oh what the fuck what happened why is my camera up here and it still looks kind of nice from up here yeah but hey oh you think i know what happens not sticker friendly if you can if anyone can find me some sticker friendly quotes i can see what i can make okay so what probably happened is that the object spawned but it spawned off of mario who had a weird rotation at the moment all right one more try so does that's like see if any of your code i don't think so i've entirely forgotten the context of most of these i bought it for 35 a piece and i sold it for 400 a piece and i made six thousand dollars on cock i do remember the context of that wow okay that's more centered so so so   wait youtube's just telling me that my bid rate is a third of what it should be oh have i shown you guys this here okay wait wait wait let me show you this this is so cool i think i did that this week so oh no huh the fog isn't really working what do you mean by the fog isn't really working the phone is working perfectly fine so it's like why do they usually ask me not to add fog to it so i mean fog is basically free to add to that wait it doesn't it's not looping anymore arctic did arctic remove the loop points oh yeah no way um huh i guess it's just broke an echo by wafer golf all right either way i'm ready for the next star select you got anything else Biobak i'm gonna note down the bug real quick  send it now all right oh mouse cave i have not seen this one yet oh that already looks cool oh that's so cool do we just like want this to move like this that's the animation oh all right that one looks super sick so now you see this oh that is so cool this is for um the uh what's it called the crystal cave area yes oh that is awesome you know what i think it'd be really cool if we had some of the glowing crystals from that in there if it's possible it is possible but it's gonna mess with the lighting quite a bit and i see can we just billboard them no oh i don't know it's like i think the perfect cherry on top would be having the crystals in there if it doesn't mess with the lighting too much yeah but this is really really cool i see all right so there's not much we can do about it right now that's fine okay it's two thousand deep don't worry Biobak i am well aware so did you see what i said the card should turn we'd have to time it to the track the f3d settings is the fog not in the material oh you use global fog oh no wait wait wait wait what's the microcode on the other backgrounds also set to f3d let me check that real quick so It's set to F3D Sneaky microcode, yep It doesn't really matter which microcode you use but if you use regular F3D then the displace is a lot bigger than it should be and just renders a lot slower Now I already saw that it was not in the material, don't worry Let me just figure out where this is here 970.100.300 This is not fully black, is that on purpose? That it's like slightly grey? All right This is also very similar to the other ActSelect So we can probably run that with the same function, we just need to add additional parameters So The card is animated with a noise model, first you will have to reanimate it So Dude I hate this error That's such a stupid error The value is reused elsewhere. It's like a global variable Stupid So These are gonna make some banger clips like people are gonna go fucking crazy over these There's a lot of really stupid gcc warnings you can not get rid of unfortunately So Okay, so we're gonna turn these into x style offset So So So So So  Bit of a weird function argument organization, but two caps Compiles all the same kind of Actually doesn't compile the same but it works out So Three news and stuff the moment the star is selected. Yes. Yes again So this goes the object animations border you wait through the pane, I don't know about that Just add y already y scrolling maybe but y scrolling is already in there So That's far Are you sure about this Biobak? This is like 30 000 coordinates far I don't think we need three tiles. I think two tiles is easily enough Huh, this might actually be a problem because it's so far So Are the s32 types of boards They can be I mean, okay, the thing is A bool is typically just a single bit right bool is not a real type The hardware recognizes all the hardware does is operate on s32s all the time It just like has a bit flag to mask out all the remaining bits So when I use a bool or an s32 in a function like this The only difference is that when you pass an argument it might have to end with one if you use a bool So an s32 is just always better and has all the same features Hello melsto Okay Lilaa the problem is it might be outside of the 33 000 coordinate range Which would be causing a crash on the n64 So Okay, but three repeats would cause a crash This is the issue I do not want my n64 to crash It's like too far So If you render any object out of this range your n64 is just gonna crash I will have to bring the fog nearer But you're going beyond this it's just a crash So I think I have to shorten this whole thing What the fuck So I think this should do it And I am going to have to make this like half the size unfortunately But we're not used to yoshi card here doesn't really matter If I like once the yoshi card we can add the yoshi card if not then not So unfortunately I do have to do this So what the hell can I somehow like turn the fork off for rendering so they can see the level where is this this is here what do I have selected oh the floor so this should still make it seamless since i'm in your live chat since like last year the hack is already yoshi theme what about making some sort of small sequel minigame to the yoshi racing simulator it'd be kind of fun but i feel like that's it's blowing the scope up too much i did want it in this year for a little bit but i realized like doesn't fit the scope of this game it's like too random hello please are you gonna put the entire universe into the mario 64 pc port yes please just make a game that i can live in i do not want to play a video game i want a second life i want the second life in mario 64 pc port thank you this is still almost 30 000 actually can you play second life yeah no i'm i'm trying to joke about how there's many games that are actually just like a full-on here's a second life you can live and not like actual minigames i think skyrim started that trend oh the spawn z is already minus three minus six thousand wait so which way does the camera look camera's looking this way we're at minus six thousand six thousand down or up i think it's down that gives us quite a few more coordinates to work with i need a number of coordinates and how much is too much how do you know i just do i don't know what do you mean i'm trying to understand what question you're asking can you see them in blender oh i just added a plane here with six fifty five six coordinates and that's like i know it's this much it can be this much in any direction you just rotate up what's nope same issue i mean the best we could do is move the camera back but then i'd have to like look into hacking the camera and i don't really wanna do that so this is something that's a lot less to run now could we use trying to make really nice facts here yes we can hackasm64 uses wisecast lightning engine which is basically just point lights from f3dsx i don't know what the engine actually does or how it's different from just fucking using point lights like what's the point of the engine why don't you just use point lights explain like how is it different from just putting a point light in your game why don't i use point lights because they take an unnecessary amount of imem and i can just use the original lights to fake point lights so i don't know if any n64 game has impressive lighting okay i need to render a square at the end here so that the background doesn't do this oh shit do hmm we do need to fill the buffer somehow that's exactly what we do in valid inputs okay how do we make the backgrounds gray the best without having to deal with too much shit switch and if compile to the same thing unless your compiler has a specific optimization turned on that turns it to a jump table in which case the switch case is faster that's exactly what we do in valid input what do you mean a gray plane attached to the camera i mean yes technically that's what we want i'm just thinking about what's the best way to actually get this gray plane in because i can't just attach it to the model i also can't just attach it to the render i might have to spawn a separate object that is just a gray plane i think that is the play here so like so we should use the same material as this just to ensure it's the same thing um they are probably also not identical in c sharp maybe also not in java i doubt they're the same it probably depends on your compiler flex i don't know if java even has those maybe it's like a build option so whatever  oh whoops  oh i just have the name wrong don't i okay mesh there we go What even is PG-3 oh I see ah, this is what I did Oh shit This is actually fucked up that I'm doing this What the fuck is A-Pole? Oh I see, yeah that works No this makes sense, it's for the gay hole, it needs to be called gay pole Alright, let's see how this works out YouTube won't let me speak, damn Lilaa, silenced by big tech once again Semmel or Brötchen? I have never used the word Semmel in my life There is nothing, it stopped rendering everything entirely, how? What the fuck are you talking about Lilaa? Are you schizo posting in my chat Lilaa? Did all the backgrounds stop working or something? What the hell? Hmm, not this one I think I have it defined for this I do not Okay, something must be going wrong in the tile functions here then I guess I was going the wrong direction so this makes sense maybe Undefined reference to SQR? It's an SM64 delete, what the fuck? What's this for playing? Oh okay, I see Got a super cum working, but with a U and no E Wait, you can't say cum because YouTube is deleting that if you say it None of you guys can say cum, but I can 1984, literally Alright, so this is a good start I think this is a good amount of fuck Like you can barely see your head, I think that's good Now why do these tracks not render? Wrong layout, that's why Why is there a white primitive cut on here? Cum Wait, you can! Maybe add a minecart and be blind? Oh, you think we should add the thing that is in the blend file that Biobak asked me to add? You think that would be a good idea? I think you might be onto something Should we make it faster? Yeah, I was It looks so much smaller here than in-game I have already set it to 80 speed, which is crazy Biobak modeled this at an insane scale This minecart is probably 5 times as big as Mario The minecart is 4 times as big as Mario Why is the grey plane not here? The grey plane needs to be here That is my biggest issue with this Why are there cow vertices? I fucking hate this Oh my god, everything you do in Puzzles and Dragons always has these cow vertices Pain Making something bigger doesn't... Actually, yes, it does mean it's harder to render, because it can't be too far away from the camera But it also means that the depth is more accurate, which I guess doesn't really matter in this scenario But there are slight differences We don't want the background to be too distracting I think that there's a very tempting force to just add more and more shit Until it's just a clusterfuck of stuff, but it kinda ruins the elegance of the background Yes, but I don't think there's any weirdness to begin with Oh, it's because the position is not set So it's just spawned in a random location Hmm It's still not there Clip plane? I think it's a clip plane moment Honestly, it might be I have an idea Fuck it Fuck all of this This is what we do Damn Buy a big box, yep He is helping me rework some of my older levels What the fuck? Okay, I see my mistake I mean, I don't mind paying him, but he never asked for any money Except as a joke, $5 per vertex, which I can't afford But my YouTube as it is, is already barely even profitable Ah, it renders without depth, right Then why is it rendering over this? Oh, no, they all set the background Hmm Hmm This kind of sucks Fuck He is starving, damn Like actually, I'm not sure if you're joking anymore Because asking to be paid seems completely reasonable But saying you're starving seems a little... I did not expect that What is jackup level? Oh, there we go Oh, the tracks render a bit weird under the star Hmm Will you be playing Super Mario 64 releases? Sure What are you talking about? It's very clear what I'm talking about I'm talking about that the rails here, they don't render correctly They look weird, I find It's kind of the rails render on top, so the fuck is kind of disappearing, I guess Hmm Maybe we can push the fuck back a little bit To fix this Hmm I'm not really interested in that, Lilo Hmm Yeah, I think this is a bit less noticeable now And it also looks a lot deeper Well, what else am I supposed to do? I can't just not respond seriously Okay, yeah, my YouTube channel last month, $6.90 and a little bit on Patreon I definitely cannot pay him enough to buy all his groceries But I can definitely give you some of that for all the help It likes colors There's not much we can do without messing with the fuck, unfortunately Hmm Go fund me to feed the starving biopacks Hmm Yeah, definitely, I mean, that's definitely the plan with the music That would like buy the music and like pay the musician off Hmm Yes, these levels are all going to be pretty easy, 60 FPS When I mean jacquard level, I mean the area where one jumps into a pipe Why do you call that a jacquard level? What is wrong with you? Oh, what the hell am I looking at? Hmm Animate the turning place, what do you mean? It's just a nice modifier, I see I'm just thinking about how I would best translate this in the game Hmm What if we make it so that we give this thing different rotation targets Depending on the coordinate, module, some other value We're not exporting the blend animation, that's not what we want We could just, you know, make noise, like it's not an issue I don't wanna use cozy stool, guys, this is noise, we have noise in mario 64 We don't need to timestamp the fucking noise, leave me alone Aha Yes, but turning, that still should not be animated as noise or whatever This is a static object, I'm gonna export it as a static object You still haven't even told me what you mean by animated turning How do you animate turning? Like this? Or like... Like this? Like, what do you mean? When does cozy stool do? Yeah, you can export object animations And basically you do like any keyframe animation and then you can just export it via some tool And export all the keyframes into like a separate format Okay, so you want the car to follow the trails. Why would we use Cozy's object exporting tool if we could just like make the spline points a thing and move it along the spline points? Oh shit, I didn't save this one yet. I didn't think of it. Well, maybe instead of trying to think of a solution, you should have thought about what the problem was first, because you didn't tell me what the problem was. You just told me a random solution, and I didn't even know what problem you were seeing. That is an issue. I'm so into writing a giant robot Yoshi with an original design. Okay, this is cool. This is very cool. I'm gonna cry. It's all fine. We do not need to cry. It's been only two years to go until you have 60 FPS, the other game you need 60 FPS, that's  Oh guys, I have a banger video actually coming out. We're gonna be Biobak's friend, but this one. No Pony is overrated. But this one's gonna make the bucks. Okay, let's formulate a plan. Spawn minecart, move minecart to spline points, increase and increase by 80 a tick, and that's our distance along the spline. And by case, why is Lompony cringe? It's just a video about how the N64 could have had much higher polygon counts and how polygon count doesn't matter as much as people think. Someone's saying random swear words in Spanish, that's not good. This shit is gonna get de-arrowed fast. Dude, there's just like the number one case, hate that, just changing all my thumbnails on the de-arrow plugin and changing the titles to like less accurate ones for some reason. I don't know why they would do that, but they do do that. That's not good. Well at least it's finished now. Interesting. Will there be a lantern? No, because of the lighting issue that we kept talking about the whole stream. Oh, behave mirror object, perfect. Actually, true. Spanish won't be that scary though. Oh, whoops. Yep, that was deserved. Where's my minecart? Oh, I spawned the wrong object. Hello Spanish, hello to all my bonjours out there. You mean the oil? Yes, you take damage when you touch the oil. Where's my minecart? Let's try something. This should make the minecart move like through the screen from behind. Okay, that kind of works. Okay, now we're getting somewhere. I think Biobak wanted this to be like... Nope, I think this is fine. But it should be moved up like 300 coordinates maybe? Let me find the exact amount. 293. When will my minecart all stay like this during the boss fight? It looks too different to the block itself. I would darken it. Hmm, I'm unsure. Maybe we'll darken it. Okay, there we go. Now we need to animate this. Goofy ass song, true. Is the ScareFuzz64 compatible? Anyone know? How do I find out what it is? Is this an Erp's Curve? I don't think it is. Cool. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, we can do Metroid Prime next stream maybe? You're just gonna be here early enough to let me know. Hmm. When Mario Expansion Kazoo released it? I don't know, that's dumb. It will happen one day. What do you do if you're young and something is hypothetically watching Scooby-Doo Toilet content every day? There's only one cure. Nevermind, don't do this. I don't want to finish my sentence. Once we get to the dinner table. Nope, I do not have a solution. You are powerless. Well, the next part is Splinter. Oh, here we go. Dude, fucking Fuzz64 added the water skybox segment to my level? I am so sad. This is gonna cause my game to not compile. One second. Why does it do this? It should not be allowed to do this. But yeah, if you want to discuss pay after the stream, we can do that. I don't know if I can. I mean, I definitely can't pay you like a real job. But you should be compensated somewhat. I used to know Fuzz64. The old ones are not well usable. Okay, so we are going to use the O-Action of BG5 to find the X position of this thing here. I am Prince of Nigeria. If you finish your sentence, I will transfer 100,000 USD in Bitcoin Wallet to your address. Okay, I was gonna say the only cure is an actual bullet, but that's a bit brutal. It's your little brother. You shouldn't do that. Now give me the money. I literally never hear about this whole Skibidi Toilet thing unless Arthur or Lilo is complaining about it. You guys are way too obsessed with this. That is my perception of this. Okay, let's do this. Oh, the tile upset is weird. This has to be a full number. Let's see. Happy, happy, happy. You made up a fucking meme with the happy happy cats. What are you talking about? I didn't. It's real. Zayna, you know the happy cats are real. Yeah, I know the happy cat song. See? See? See? Oh my God, I can't sing in that high of an octave worse than anything. I think the happy cat has been a meme between us for a while now. Yeah. Okay, no joke. My Instagram algorithm is ruined thanks to cats. I used to get all this cool artwork and art tips, and now it's majority cats. And most of it is happy, happy, happy cats. My Instagram algorithm is ruined. I mean, some of them are kind of nice. They're pretty good. I don't need to segment it. It's broken. I also had another idea for the Yoshi sticker set. What is it? I hate video games. I'm doing it right now. But that's not popular enough. Only someone on my stream or that would know me personally would get that. Fair. But I've got a really good emotion for this Yoshi. Maybe we can use another quote for it. Yeah. Should have like a Yoshi of every color and we can just put some of some of the case quotes with it It's up to you It's getting a little bit much though Yeah, all right. See ya and well, I don't forget to subscribe and hit that Bell Mr. Beast now I'm about to hit that Bell I Need half of these values Yes, you with the park face and the text that says 0.01 microseconds Was my big suggestion I'm gonna screen I'm gonna just take a quick screenshot of that There we go, all right perfect suggestion Yeah, no other question is if we can really use all this Yoshi stuff So start X is More wait, we need to find the first as less Right because it keeps the creasing yes And all action is also being decreased Okay, so we find the first that is less and then we find the first to this having a higher value And Then We need the distance here So and C is gonna be less So start Z and minus and Z And since our position is gonna be Unless it's also be like start Z Pg5 actually not all This needs to be into a float All right, this should do it So if you don't have time for the two other star stacks You want to at least see how to show them on stream. I can show them if you want Let's see how this looks first I Got a time It's gone Hmm Why is it gone when it is a break I guess that works, too I'm never sure how many indents the break goes out like does it go out of the loop here or just out of the brackets here Oh Okay, yeah, and then the break is fine So this is a small positive value because all action is bigger. Oh Does it need to be the other way around This is weird So the start X is gonna be like minus 9,000 it's gonna be bigger than All of these positions are bigger this doesn't make any sense I Maybe I should just print And we actually can also scroll the wheel texture it was good I tried it Okay, I mean scrolling the wheel is basically free All right, I'm gonna print I Hope I didn't put Oh anywhere did I oh shut up be a lot here Who is the is viewer This should be a plus two not a minus. Oh, no, it should be a minus Oh Interesting, that's definitely not what this value is I hope Oh my god leader, it's so useless leave me alone with that. Oh I'm so tired of people trying to tell me to use the weird parallel launch their console debug shit I want nothing to do with it. I can just print to the screen They still want nothing to do with it The fucking connect on the everdrive doesn't even work. So even if it's not parallel specific It's specific to a tool that doesn't actually work Now it just needs to be plus one so we just had to divide by zero here the whole time whoops No one that didn't work Well, I didn't build it Okay, so there are a few issues with this but overall it's not looking awful like it's at least doing something I Still want nothing to do with the Lilaa there is no point in me using it, especially not here I'm just tired of people suggesting the same tool over and over Okay, so The 5,000 stuff will never be less no action. Is that important? I think it is How do we deal with this I think the problem is that All of this is actually not starting at zero it's starting at 5,052, isn't it? No, it's starting at minus 6,000 here I Can see value in like outputting warnings and stuff like that But that's not at all what I'm doing here Still no good I Think something in the logic is just still wrong So it's less than no action. Then the next one is gonna be way less than action. That's a problem The way we do it right now. It's actually interpolating to the previous point I I Should be doing this and then the end is a bless so these can be flipped again. I  That's why I'm so confusing a beginning I'm just going to get really pissed and explode on stream. I Seem angrier than I am I'm just very easily irritated, but I also like instantly just don't care anymore Yeah Okay, but at least it's kind of like following the lines now I Also just realized a mistake I made I That was making this a lot uglier than it should be 496 8 9 3 shit How much is it really 50 coordinates Oh, obviously I think every random one is up at those values. What values? I don't know. That's what I'm trying to debug right now So if this is less than our action which the first point it should have happened Which is fine actually then we take this one and interpolate to the previous one So this interpolates to this one, which is fine and because the first one will never happen We actually do not even need this part Okay, that's a good start Okay makes sense So Very small value this start next Less small value gets subtracted. So this is a negative value this is By definition less than this. So this is a big negative value So they cancel out and becomes a positive value Let's see if I get a weird alpha anywhere I Am not sure why it goes to such a little number. Hello crispy You're kiki. Hello kiki It has been a while hasn't it but that's what you've always done you've always like shown up like once every six months or something You The alpha is always zero, there's no way that's right. Oh Because the casting is the wrong order This MF twerking true Hmm And don't worry we're gonna make it look better I know it looks bad right now But it's gonna look better in the end to not worry Or even if it doesn't look better we can just remove it but we still have to see how it looks Once we actually have everything in Because I'm pretty sure it will look better Oh, I see one issue we have Since this goes directly to this there's like a period of nothing happening here. Oh Wait, no, I meant those goes back up to this and then When we're here this this is the first number that can be Less than election. Yes And this is A Full action is minus 12,000 Then this is the first number that is less So this should all be fine because there's a device to this and then this can't be then it's this one that's weird Let's also print I just to be safe I Should give us the eye at the point or at which we exit the loop. So we know which point is the issue Oh Ten the issue is a ten I like how the alpha always decreases. This is exactly what we wanted. How's there an issue at 10 though? Did I skip one of these points by accident? It's still throwing up this issue What if no point is smaller that has to be it Is it because I am less than 10 or not? I don't think so. There we go. We just had to add the one extra point. Actually, maybe you are right. Yes, right. Actually, that is like half the issue. I feel like in Biobak's sketch this was closer to the camera. It was slightly closer to the camera, wasn't it? Regardless of whether it was, I wanted it closer to the camera. Trying to make it centered between the stars and the text. I was thinking it should be that the text is centered between the bottom of the minecart. I think I prefer this. Look at it. Looks good. It kind of makes the stars pop out really nicely. You also clogged my toilet again. What? That must have been you. No. It was the neighbors. Just like they come in and eat the cake. But the cake is in the fridge. We haven't had any cake today. Most normal conversation. Yes, exactly. Kiki. Okay. Let's see this. Oh shit, I did this again. So now, if we did it right, we should have a little bit of a pitch rotation. It might be the opposite of what we want it to be, but it should look pretty nice. That's not what we wanted. I even called it raw and then I set the pitch. Cool. Also, no, this is good. Let's try it. Is this doing the pitch in the right way? I think it should be the opposite. You can't just create a safe state. It doesn't work like that. Okay. Why was I banned on SMW Central? It's a long story. It's a funny story too. I was indeed banned from being based. Okay. It feels a bit slow. That's a pretty easy fix. Before I apply the fix, I will also add the scrolling so we don't have to boot into this twice. Oh my god, that has color. This is so good. Cool. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't want to add the scrolling with Fast64 because it's just so unoptimized if you do. Okay. You can't include the header here. That's cool. Okay. It is now faster. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Is this it? I think that is it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see if it scrolls. Let's see if it scrolls. Do the wheels scroll or not? I can't tell. So this needs to be faster now. Does anyone see the wheel scroll? I'm not sure. Maybe I did it wrong. Yeah, it's tilting to the left and not to the right because the tilting velocity is linear. And because it first goes to the left, it never goes back to the middle because it's already to the left now. Oh, the wheels are definitely scrolling now. Okay. Okay. Okay. Need to make the wheels bigger? Nah. It's good as is. I think this might be way too fast for scrolling now. Yep. Okay. I can't even tell the direction of the scroll. But it's a long story of being banned in SMW Central. Basically, back then we were trying to make games N64 compatible. And we were working on it. And there was this one person that knew nothing about it, that just kept posting the stupidest theories about it on the forum. And he kept badgering people, hey, when are you gonna do this? When are you gonna do this? When are you gonna do this? So I replied that I fucked the dark ones, which I didn't do, but I thought it was a funny reply at the second. And then I got banned for that. Okay. The scrolling looks awful. I don't like it at all. When did you ever think this was the appropriate answer? That's a good question. I think I need to pick a different text. I'm gonna ruin your bio. Model. Are you Luigi in this one? Likely, yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. 12345678. This should probably scroll a little better. Alright, if you have any more star select screens that you want everyone to see, yeah. Bubble Dome star select, alright. We'll take a look at it, but we won't be able to import it today. Oh, that looks nice. I like it. I am enjoying this. I think this should maybe be E0 instead of C0. And there's one more issue I just noticed. And that is that I can still disappear. This should fix it all. Okay, well, great progress on the boss fight we did today. You might not like coding it though. Oh, that's cool. Do you just kind of see the domes in the distance here? Is this just scrolling forward at you? Oh, the new marine looks cool too. This looks way better than the one we have in the level. We should replace it with that one. Oh, that looks really cool. Yep, this is perfect. I'm not sure about the lights here, because the lights are kind of like over the stars. Do you think we should remove the lights? I'm not sold on them. It's cool that you see the level in the distance. It's like you're traveling there. Yeah. That's also true. Alright, let's see this. Oh, okay, I see, I see. Did you see it? From the beginning. Oh, it's so cute! Yep. I love that. Maybe we should have some more first. There's more animations in this?  One item and when you select the star. Okay, let me... How do I find the other animation? Fly in, fly out? Oh, when you select the star. Okay. Oh my god. That's insane. He's got a little hop. Yep. Maybe we should have a couple other birds, or maybe some falling leaves in the background. I can definitely add falling leaves here. Oh, but the falling leaves are going to mess with the layout again. Yeah, this is all possible. Well, no, he's going to fly... No, he's going to be under the text. Oh, he's going to be flying under the text. I could probably make him fly over the text if we really need it. No random over the text? It's possible. Yeah, we should give all of this a try. But that is for next stream. Now you guys have a cliffhanger. Oh, now this is a big cliffhanger. I will be offline for now and I'll see you guys next Saturday. Bye bye. Bye bye.
