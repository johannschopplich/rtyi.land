["Trip Through Time"] ["Trip Through Time"]  We are two minutes early today to make up for the times we were 30 seconds late before. That's my excuse. Hello EpicLegend, hello HerminusMario8573. Hello CaptainSweetRoll, hello TomMasses, hello Aaron. ["Trip Through Time"] Hello Skoolacross. Hello Vellzey, hello NonPlusNoko. Oh, you responded to my comment. What was it? Hello B-Turk. Hello Selton. ["Trip Through Time"] Leaving a comment, critiquing whatever I made is always good. There's always a good chance that I will just say, well, your criticism is stupid, I'll ignore it. But there's also a good chance that I'll seriously look at it and reconsider my decisions. I feel like that's kind of like an integrity thing you should do. Always look at criticism very objectively. And unemotionally. Did I block you on Discord? Yes! You pinged me for no reason, so I blocked you. If you are going to be annoying, I will block you. It is as simple as that. Hello Clayman. Today we are here with the Goofy Gooba music. Heh. 473. Hello IonStream. R.I.P. BMG Gamer. Well, you know, you live and you learn. You have to have this negative experience of getting blocked for being annoying once so you can be less annoying in the future and maybe not be annoying. You know what I mean? Hello Jackarack. When are you working on Big Case? Lila. Little Lila. We are working on the swinging saloon doors. Little Lila, did you see the duel I posted today? So we got a few things left to finish up. For one, these train tracks need to stop floating in midair. It is actually a pretty short list. We want to add a chain chomp here. For that I want to move the wiggler and the chain chomp mempool alloc to an object specific bank instead. Then we want to make the train wheels move. If you can see right now, they don't really move. It kind of looks bad. We want to add some sound, some smoke and some VFX to the train. And right now I am working on the swinging doors that are supposed to be in the saloon right here. And then after that there's just one thing left and that is the bartender's hat here. We want it to grow every act. Revent stopped working for you? No! Something's weird with the bar textures. Let me investigate that real quick. God, I felt like shit before the stream started but now I'm feeling fine. I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm just sick when the pressure is on. You know what I mean? I just get down with it. Hello, Biomech. Why is this one so hard? It's so weird. The hell? It was just blue in-game. What the fuck? Don't get it. Maybe the render mode is not being reset actually. That's probably what it is. I think this is a fast 64 bug. Although the fail looks a bit too quick in addition back into gameplay. The fail? Let me see what you mean. Mastodamia. Mastodamia. Is that marzipan? White chocolate sounds good. What the fuck? True. It's a known fast 64 issue that render mode bleeding does something wrong sometimes. Let me see. What do you mean? The fail into gameplay goes too quick. You mean like when Mario gets hit? Oh, that part. I see what you mean. You know you can cheat this guy too? You have to shoot when it says fire, but... I shot before it said fire. I see what you mean though Leela. Let me look into that real quick. So you think this one's too early basically. I can increase this to like 52. You definitely need more time before the fire and some indicators. Indicator. Okay. Like a countdown? Or like a countdown?     Yeah, not all the signs are there Bruno. Zeno's making the textures. Oh shit. Hello Dan. You're looking for Leela? 321. Yeah, maybe we do a 321 here. Alright, I'll try a 321. That is true Mushi, but now we have a much better idea of what we actually want here. Alright, let's see the fail. Okay, that's better. I agree. Yes, Biomech. That would be a good idea, but I'm planning to have a completely custom music here. I want it to be like a proper... Something like that. I don't know. Okay. So... Fine. Are we making 15 Marvel? Okay. Oh, it stays active, but Mario stayed resets? I gotcha. It's the shell bug from original Mario 64, isn't it? Damn Leela, even Dan misses you. How sad is this? Why wouldn't I just do this? It stays half active. It's weird, but it's funny. Yeah, I know what you mean. Dude, Leela, yesterday Scuttlebug Razor. I saw him in the chat and he said how much he misses you. Or she. I think Scuttlebug Razor is trans now. She wants you to PR her fast 64 PRs. To review them. Yes, yes. Okay, that's good to know. I wasn't sure if that's a real memory or a fake memory I dreamt. Sometimes I have fake memories that come to me in my dreams and they just aren't true. And sometimes they are true after all. But they came to me in my dreams. Maybe I'm a prophet. I mean, I was going to have to say I thought it might be layers of irony when I first started. Yeah, exactly. That's the thing. All right, let's see the countdown. Oh, and this should also make a click sound. I don't know why it's in German. Explain layman terms. What were devs doing wrong when developing for the N64? Skill issues. Can't stand these IA music videos with nonsense added like that. Totally random generated. All right, let's see it. It didn't say fire. He just shot at me. I don't know. Lila, we finished a whole ROM egg that you didn't even see. You have lots of stuff to play. Once you are back on your computer. Why is this one probably shouldn't be random, right? Well, okay, this one should be random, but this one you shouldn't be. Why is it like that? What the hell is this for? Oh, because this is when it shoots when it says fire. I see. And the part where I randomize when the fire goes down is missing here. Not much, but a bit. Oh, but we didn't even release it yet. Rude gaming to you. True. Well, I didn't think would ruin all of gaming. I mean, many games don't even really need optimization because they're very simple. That's crazy. We'll do something like this and randomly waits between one second and three seconds. Oh, you also have to use USB tethering. Then that sucks. I had to use it for a while and I hated it. Is it kind of experience to have priests come to your house during Easter? Is that a Portugal smaller city thing? No, I never had that happen. Where I live, priests come to your house if you turn 90 years old. Happened to my grandfather. And he fucking gated it. They're like, congratulations on turning 90. Okay, well, get the fuck out of my house, please. He didn't say please. We've noticed you're going to die soon. Wouldn't you like to convert to Jesus? Fuck. I wish Aza was here so I could get the permission to show our compact. I think it's kind of cute. They hit everyone with water. Who wanted that? All right, let's see this. Three, two, one. He shot without saying fire, you asshole. You're cheating. Now I know why. During the pandemic, they made sure to clean Jesus' feet with rubbing alcohol. Who would have thought that? Well, Zayn outside of the family is also very religious in the house. They have, like, at least 20 pictures of Jesus around. So I am somewhat familiar with, like, religion, religious tradition. It memes non-drum for a birthday. He showed me then. It was very funny. Hello, Michi. Okay, it works. Except he doesn't fucking shoot at me. There we go. Now it works. Trust, it works now. During the distance is pretty low where I live right now. Did they turn Fog all the way up? You think they did it for visual effect or optimization? Because, you know, a lot of the time Fog actually ruins your performance. Alright, now it all works. Promise. He will shoot the egg at me and he will count down. Two, one. Hey! Alright, let's try to win one. Three, two, one. Every time. Oh, are they trying to pray the fence away? Is that why they're coming to you? Either way, we want to work on the barters today and not the Boshy. I just wanted to real quick add the counter to him. I wasted time on here, whoops, should be like this. Doesn't need parameters, doesn't need collision data, doesn't need a home, also does not need a home. I don't think we want a shadow on it. All I have to do is deepen Boshi's voice and he'll be completely done. Yeah, I'll deepen his voice a little bit. I put it on my list just now, it's not gonna be difficult. I actually already have the functionality to pitch the Yoshi samples because I had to implement it before. The reason I have never heard anyone else talk about priest visiting was because the Is it there, like, yeah, no, not deactivate. This doesn't deactivate. It doesn't. This is a lie. It doesn't deactivate. Yeah, I might have to look at Mario RPG. Okay. Okay. This behavior, let me check how far we move it. I want to move this for 2.5. No. And we need to set this on one of the two doors. Does this one West-like level have a name? Rent Center Badland, I think is what we decided on. We still need to do the star names next. That will be our next challenge. I should be rotating these. Yes, I said Grand Sand Badland. That is likely going to be the final name. That invites you to a conversation about shadows. Lila will get the treatment everyone has been getting on Dan's voice channel recently. It is funny. We often hang out in Dan's voice channel, and every time he brings up shadows or graph notes, at least one or two people are like, no, not again. You can just do this here. Back from Disney World. It's good. Oh, what the fuck? I did it wrong. No way. Wait, how is this wrong? I am confused. Oh, well. Yeah, no worries, Dan. It's fun talking about stuff like that. Distant Mounds. We already added Distant Mounds last stream, didn't we? Oh, so it's just your internet that's fucked, Lila? Do you have an amusement park? Amusement park kind of snitch? I do. I don't know. Maybe not. It has to be somewhere. Isn't it good that there's new rights? Ah, this is what I want. This is not what I want. Surely somewhere I check the Warp Node ID, right? You know what? Fuck it. This is too Mario. I don't know. Are all the ideas for Stars and Yoshi coins complete at this point? I had an idea for Horseshoe Throwing and our collective minigames. I haven't really thought about it. Shit. I need to finish the Yoshi coins. Yeah, there's still a little bit to be done on this stage. Lila and Burger King gets me on stories. This is the first time I'm hearing of this. It sounds great, though. Is a thousand times a thousand is a million? Really? What a surprise. The Internet is just the KKK of positive opinions? What? How about Hammer Bros. somewhere that throws horseshoes and he's the one running the minigame? I don't know if I'm gonna add a whole minigame. The Yoshi coins are supposed to be like little things. All right. And now we need to make it so that if Mario walks into the door, the door starts to swing. But let me make sure that the swinging effect is right for now, actually. I just died up. Actually, if you died, you wouldn't be able to type. What? What in tarnation? Oh, I know what I did. OK. Wait, it actually deactivates? Shit, I thought it just made it inactive. OK. Something like this. OK, so that's it on the Cowboy Hammer, bro. We kind of have an issue with this level in that we're kind of out of memory. So I don't really want to add new characters if we can prevent that. All right, the doors are properly closed now and I can still get in. And now the door should swing when I get out. Well, they're swinging. I don't know what to do. Interesting. I'm guessing this is just a 16 roll around. So. Can this happen? Where it's like. Yeah. We'll just do this. Can I just clip all this shit and make it into YouTube shorts? A lot of this would go hard on YouTube shorts. I love a squishy Mario's. We made him a little squishy. Turn him into a little bit of a squish ball. Oh, no, don't go back to the Yoshi kangaroo. We've talked about the Yoshi kangaroo for three weeks in a row. And I say no every time. All right, next, if you touch it, they also need to be moving. And actually, I want there to be a little bit more friction on this because they are too swinging. When you kick them, they should be very spinny, right? But probably only the one you kicked. So. Would be funny to have to kick them to enter the crew. Give me a good computer. I did your stuff for a year. How much is a good computer? Is that worth it for a year? Right now, I pay my shorts guy like two hundred seventy dollars per year. It's actually quite a bit. I don't know.     But you would probably make much better shorts.  Now we need to find out the direction that Mario is in so we can get a little object to get Mario. With this. And actually, we did this before. The bush. Chick bush.  Fake bush. What is it called? Fake bush. This should do it. Stuff and stream stuff. But we see that she has 10 seconds before the right click menu opens. What the fuck? Yeah, you really need a better PC. How do you use blender? Since I owe you for the level editing anyway, what if I just get you the PC and like only a portion of that counts? Does that make sense? I get you a thousand dollar PC. It counts as like eight hundred dollars that I owe you. This is too much velocity, though. That's my computer. Mine's from like 2017. Wait, mine's only a year newer than yours. Although I upgraded some parts for Unreal Engine development, because my job requires me to actually use Unreal Engine. OK, this is exactly the wrong direction.  It would be funny if you had to kick them to enter, but I feel like that that might discourage people from entering. Sunrun rise for jobs? No, it's I work at a game studio and we just happen to use Unreal Engine. I feel like I don't like the base rotation. I think it would look better if it was slightly outwards, but maybe not actually. Oh, game dev jobs. Yeah, there's tons of game dev jobs that are looking. It's super easy to find a job if you're an Unreal Engine experienced person. Ways to music offbeat? I don't know. Ask Nintendo. They made this. What's Biobank up to recently? I will show you one screenshot of what Biobank did to the level. He just started reworking course 11 and this already looks insane. I'll show you what this looked like before. Do you remember this container here I made? A while ago with some random textures. Biobank had an issue with the combiner, so he sent me an image and he made it look like this. It's crazy. Looks so much better already. It looks like it has so much depth. I mean, it's weathered. It looks really good. Yes, Clueless Koopa. But OK, what you're doing right now, you have a solution and you're looking for a problem. But I want to implement solutions to my problems. True, Biobank. Although last week he was on Kangaroo Yoshi. He's not as dead set on the thing as the other guy. Oh, why are they swinging in opposite directions? Fuck, let me kick the door. I might have to make the warp smaller, just so we can play with these more. How is this still wrong? Does that have to be like... Oh, wait, no, wait, don't wait. Heh. Oh no, we don't want to do the steel leaf section. The steel leaf section is great, I think. Maybe, maybe not. Yeah, but there's no reason for us to even add the horseshoe thing, you know? Just let things happen naturally. Bye. Should be games is way smaller. It's gonna be tough to make them look like proper saloon doors The entrance way smaller So you think my saloon doors look like shit I see I see I Can't probably make it smaller You thinking just like the inner part here This is a shower curtain wouldn't you want to live in a saloon shower? Okay, I will heed your warning and make them smaller see if that makes this easier to 3d model You You're thinking something like this I'm guessing Easy enough change About the session. Did you see the thing I said before the end of the world? I'm showing this guy or something for knowing an area. Yeah, I saw that. It's really weird Lila, I've changed the Bowser statue already. You might like it better now. Let me show you It looks like this now Isn't that slightly better it's a pretty complicated combiner And I think it's slightly better And F8 so we can't set this to age to make it smaller or we can move them further in So I see over in the twitch it or something. I don't see them here. Yes. Yes, we have twitch and YouTube separately done It doesn't work differently. Although unfortunately, I Honestly fear you this doesn't look like bar 64 anymore you should fear me I can bench 315 pounds You So we have something like this now and the Sun and or needs to fit this new mold Probably said I am the main character now I am You But what was that water special at all, I mean, I'm glad then you added water special the color Yeah, I have a note in my notes that says to make it so that I can color the water Splash so once that is there That that issue will be resolved. You are perfectly right and saying that the colors wrong Have yet to add the feature There's some muscle keys usually going to be in the game no, I don't put myself in my games I Think self inserts is a little cringe If you can't get enough of me you can keep watching my stream so You Speaking of cringe self-inserts have you played the last star revenge do what a fucking segway Do you mean decades after I have not But I have seen someone play it and they seem to like it a lot, but I don't think I would like it So I plan not to play it. I Should have hit the export button here The vanilla sorry wait, there's another story inch So change to what's broken like a bad guy in the lore Well, I didn't I wasn't talking about broderick specifically, but he does self-insert Right unless I know it's starting to the way and flanking not good Well, okay. I Within the community itself like the hardcore speedrunners. I think star revenge is overrated. Sure, right? It's just It's very popular there but outside of the community Outside of the core community you show it to anyone who's not super familiar from our 64x. They're gonna think it looks awful and It's not popular there I think it's just that it appears to us The ones in chat here that it is overrated because we interact with so many people that rate it highly But I think that the vast majority of people do not rate it as highly. I Don't know if I can recall it overrated because of that And it's pushing into me Okay, it's more bounce but it's it's getting there I don't know. I don't want to talk poorly about Brody attacks cuz like I Don't think there's any benefit to that and I don't want to be an asshole for no reason Right, I just my decision is to just let other people enjoy it and Just for myself Keep in the back of my mind. Like this is not what the vast majority of people actually think It's just our niche community here Okay, well for some reason we have to invert this here but it is what it is and I think we can crank this up to 25 And we also need to make it so that the face angle jaw is clenched for sure The plot is very contrived and I don't think it matters to actually playing the game New music down a little so I can hear your beautiful voice butter. Sure If it is too loud I turned it down slightly Yeah, Brody's necks are very much just like here's a level go play in it It's not like here's a new experience go experience it. You know what I mean? It's like vanilla movements and you better like vanilla movement Um, I need to make this be clamps Without using animation set of velocity, that's a terrible idea And I shouldn't be using this this is a bad idea Right, let's do it here Oh Okay, you know what I'll show it fuck it I'll show what I don't like about it On the our HTC page This is one of the screenshots he used to showcase this and it's like I Can't know like this texture repeats like 400 times in this one picture This one here repeats like 300 times. I just don't think it's so pretty That's One thing I want to point out if he starts using fast 64 and like multi textures, maybe it's gonna be better Dude the doors go the wrong direction again. Are you fucking kidding me? What what the fuck am I doing wrong here? Also takes forever to push this open You My doors are very messed up true, that's why I'm fixing them right now I Preferred a vanilla bow a metal field honestly machine Just because the textures are less obnoxious and I think the colors fit a bit better together Even though they didn't fit very well together and vanilla to begin with I Think 64 DS already has like a big improvement over Mario 64 spawn on battlefields looks wise And then I like how he's pushing them open it's going the wrong direction again Wait, how can this twist around? I Heard there's no different based on the side you kick well Hopefully not But yes, it is on both sides that's that's why this is weird wait now it's fixed Are you planning in tears I can be 60 months? Nope You Wait, this is from John to opacity And this is going further This is not how it should be right should be in minus and plus here Am I being stupid here This is 6 0 0 0 so This plus this is My brain's frozen the fuck Yes, this would be right, okay The question remains Why does the direction goes feel so random And works correctly when I'm walking into them But now it's like always turned around Cheater Check eで   I No, I And said gotta spontaneous Let's start it around one more time see what happens now now that don't have the proper limit working We're using a tense bigger than zero, which is the product more than zero Again, it doesn't matter what I do. It always turns this way. I Inverted the sign but it didn't invert the direction And now when I'm punching from the other side it also turns around That is a goofy claimant What if it rotated like no it can't force it for the around Your friend like a smart true When I'm using apps angle the fear I You Apps angle this doesn't depend on the side you're on It should be something like this Should be since should it be anything at all? You What is the forward-facing direction So if Mario's here Then we have no rotation, right, let's put up the calls extra quick And if Mario is slightly offset then it's still above zero so this is pointless Do we just check if it's more or less I Don't know Let's try this. I just get the vibe that this will work If it's consistently wrong now, we can just insert the science and it should be consistently rights Ignore why and get magnitude you don't even know what why is which directions why? Okay Okay, so we would need to invert it for one of the doors which makes sense this is planned good This is why I initially already provided the beeper I'm here You What if he used animations out of programming extra physics on the door no I Would that even work I would still have to compute the rotation There we go, wait when you push it's wrong is it not I Think the right door doesn't work. Sometimes It's this roll around at zero I Think it is We might need the angle differ earlier And the thing with this is that this is an s16 angle so it's Like minus 179 it just goes back to like 180. You know what I mean? The XYZ values are my relative to inch, okay, so Nope it's it's still turned around wrong So we don't have a forward vector one as a unit so if we actually did like Sins of face angle plus 90 got that as a forward vector and then also did it for Mario the mess wouldn't change It would still be the same thing I Didn't use Morris facing go here. Well, no wonder didn't work. I Used its starting facing location facing angle You We're probably gonna have to feature Sauron again sometime. He's currently working on making F3DX less RSP intensive in the hopes that it'll work on RTYI. Dude, no way, it's wrong again. Wait. Maybe, maybe I need to reboot this again. No! I'm just doing random stuff at this point. At some point it'll just work and I'm kind of too lazy to really think about it. Oh, we're out of music. Any music wishes? Dude, are you fucking kidding me? How is this, we're still around again. Penny's big breakaway. All right, let's listen to that. Okay, maybe we should actually think about this. So rotation from the object to Mario. We are rolling this around as it should be. Then if Mario's facing, Mario's facing angle doesn't matter. It's going to be Mario's facing angle plus 4, 0, 0, 0 because it's rotated, right? We can actually use our angle to Mario, now that I think about it. This is what we should, is that the mistake we made all along? Did we use the face angle instead of the angle to Mario? Don't tell me we did. And that makes sense because the fake bush was actually looking forward. These are looking sideways. It seems right, except when I punch it now. Why would this be turned around when I punch? Does that make sense? Not really. Probably have to turn it all around. Too late, Bernie, listening to Penny's big breakaway. Yeah, I didn't actually think this would be this much. How can it be that this is right now, except when I punch? That just doesn't check out, does it? This just doesn't make sense. Is it because Mario's velocity resets? When I punch. Instead of different directions being punched? Yes, yes, these are different branches of codes. And I also should only rotate this much, not 6, 0, 0, 0. That probably also messed with stuff. Can it be beneficial to sort all triangles on L, given by size of the triangles? Since it would expect triangles, there's no metamemories. The RDP is never finished. The RDP is permanently busy. So the situation you're describing doesn't exist. But also sorting triangles is going to be so expensive that any potential gain you would from something like that, it's just going to be evaporated. Okay, interesting. Very interesting. Understandable. Well, I can push them now, but when you punch them, they go crazy. Let's see. These should probably reset O-Angle Veljo. It's going like a doorstop. Yep. I mean, we programmed the doorstop here, basically. Kind of makes sense. Oh, that's a weird triangle there. Did we finally do it? It was all because I used fucking face angle instead of angle to Mario. I think it was. Whoops. Ahead of time in Blender? Of course the triangles are sorted in Blender, but they're sorted by overdraw, not by triangle size. You gotta sort by overdraw. If you sort by triangle size, you get garbage. Next, I want to make it so that they're also inside here. 0xE. 0xE.  Equals. Ah, shit. You don't actually need this. Don't mind. This is good. The pathway will have to be around the same size as this. So, 460.             16 units. I keep forgetting where I put the thing. Here. It's 600 units, so we need to make it shorter by... Let's see. We have 412, so 188. So 90, roughly. 94 on each side. Doable. Yo, thank you for the sub, Sonic the Hedgehog. I owe it to you as well. Never run. Oh, it cut off. I wanted to hear the end of the joke. What do they do in Texas? Will we ever know? Let me see the rest of the edges. No! I feel like this should have a more saloon-like shape instead of just being a rectangle. What is a more saloon-like shape? Maybe... Oops. Something like that? Good point. Ah, that sucks then. But the issue was really just something stupid. I was just checking the wrong angle. I was checking the object's angle and then Mario's angle instead of checking the object's angle to Mario and the object's angle. So, simple fix in the end. Google saloon doors? Fine. Google saloon doors. Dang. Oh, this is a cool shape. I don't know why my brain came up with this shape here. What is a saloon-like shape? Or something like this, fellas? What if we make a stargrave and the doors be good so it looks less like a generic saloon? Yes, that would be good. I think. Fine. Fine, I'll do it. How does XL and then... How? Hello, Jet. Maybe put the ground pound symbol on the door so you know it can't kick them. That's also a good idea. There definitely needs to be some kind of symbol on here. See you then. Have fun with your shadows. Oh yeah, the April 1st improved Mario movement. I'm sure that will be very improved. Your April 1st project. Guys, I completely forgot to make an April Fool's joke this year. I didn't do my free hour water essay. I know, it is sad. The issue with angles is that you have to convert vector to angle and convert angle to vector. False. Liquors and hookers inside. I don't think so. Maybe my blocks have something on them. I kind of like the question mark, but no. We'll remove it soon. I'm planning on making a video about random matrices. I'm planning on making a video about the short hack I made with Eiza. Two videos are kind of planned, but I couldn't make either one of them yet. Hello, RTJ. I don't think you can stick figure. I don't think you know how to compile my ROM hack. Also, the vanilla camera is just nuked. Can I? I can, but I'm not going to. I don't think I want to put an arrow in there. Let me look at actual saloons in video games.  Just a single one. Cool, cool. It looks kind of similar though, but I like the sideways stripes here. Let's actually find a decent texture here. Coding assembly? I used to, but right now we're just coding in C. We're doing it sometimes in assembly, but usually not. This already looks a lot better, to be honest. I'm going to use this. Yes, they can be played on real N64s. This one here especially is optimized for it. So you've brought up that most of the video games are in English? No, I'm still going with that. I just forgot to say it. Yeah, except only piracy. Actually, you know what? Video games encourage piracy. Fuck it. If you play video games, you need to die for encouraging piracy. Trigonometry is expensive. Did you see me use trigonometry there? I just used subtraction and addition. Do you not think that I know what's expensive and what's not expensive on the N64? Ah, shit. Oh, also, this one needs to be inverted depending on bperm2. Use some level background textures to see if I can polish anything at all before Roman releases it. I'd love to have that there. We don't use background textures. We use background skybox 3D models, things. This needs to be... No, this doesn't need to be further down. The collision needs to extend into the floor. That's what needs to happen. Like so. We're using it, of course. It is very convenient to back up your stuff on hit. And I'm back. Where are my doors? And why is... This has to be a first N64 bug. Hey, these work now, though. That's good. I don't like the color of them. I think if they're going to be part of the Milky Bar, they have to have saturation zero. Eh. Maybe like this. We would send you to Japan, into Nintendo headquarters, and hope you win the fight. You would be the chosen one. There we go. This might actually stick into the ceiling, which would really suck. I didn't really try that before. No, it is simpler to just use Git over zipping stuff. Because it's super easy with Git. Look, I can just go... Blah blah blah. And my changes are saved. And it's that simple. Hello, Nova. What's up? This is up right now. I needed to rotate these 90 degrees. Still more annoying than autosync. What is autosync? Is it one of those Microsoft OneDrive features? I cannot stand OneDrive. I do not want to upload all my files to Microsoft's cloud. Do you think Microsoft trains their AIs on the files that you upload to their cloud? I feel like they would. Oh, I see, I see. So you have a thing that automatically syncs your stuff online. Yeah, I can see how that would be kind of nice. Would be a mess of scan after that. Yeah. I mean, that's the Google strategy, right? You just do the scan though, and then you pay like the fee and you're all good. Okay, this is kind of neat. I think we're all good. I just think maybe I need to turn these around 180 degrees. I want to set a start camera here. So the way it actually rotates a certain direction at the start of an area, which is very helpful. And if we set start camera so that we can actually see Mario here, it will help a lot. So four zeros from here, I think. So this would be eight zero and this one would be just zero, but it's not. So the bottom one is eight zero. So now we would have a camera setting like this, which should make it a little more easy to see the swinging doors. That's how Uber became a thing. Just like take the fees. I mean, there's the saying that goes, if it's punishable with a fee, then it just means it's illegal if you have the money, right? And Google has the money, so what you gonna do? Find them? Will Boshy also be in jail with the Shy Guys and the Monty's? No. Boshy just says, I have had enough and leaves. He's done playing Wild West. Oh, so this one is rotated completely wrong. And Mario should not be pushed back into the warp by the doors, please. Oh, I don't like common line interface stuff. Feels so slow to use, which I don't know if that's actually true. But you have to type so much to do so little. I think you need the two sets of doors. You want no doors inside? I think we can remove the inside ones. Yeah. All right, fine. We'll remove them. Fine, we'll get rid of it. And I'll set the slot to C0, maybe. Actually, maybe this one should be like... Maybe the camera settings should be... Here? 4-0 is here, so like 8-0 is at the bottom. IDK how bits work. Well, thank you for the bits anyway. I'll use C0. All right, we got the saloon door stunt that can go off my list. Make the Bartender Koopa's head grow 10 units or so every act upwards. Let's do that. So Is it this guy? Is that the bartender? I think it is. Turbine wiring is both fast and slower. That's false, it can't be both. I don't know when this ends up being slow for me, but riding on an autobot system feels pretty fast. Oh, okay. What do you think a platformer means, Nick Figures? Okay, I have the same feeling.  Alright, so there should be something just called head material. There are other Koopas, yes, but only one guy that looks like this. Oh no, my fucking auto thing stopped working again, lovely. Can it grow every time you get a star or every time you advance an act? I think every time you get a star, because there has to be a story to this level. I think that works better. With every criminal you jail? Let's see, how many criminals are there? Let me check. The missions are saloon, secret room, so that's four criminals, then the Monty Moles, that's another four. The Rustclaw Yoshi, that's nine scavenger hunts, abandoned gold mine. There's only three stars that really are about jailing people. Well I guess there's gonna be Yoshi coins as well, but eh. I think we should just go by stars in the level, so it's a little bit more obvious. I think we have Popsi. Alright, let's see, what do we really want here? I think by default we should make his head a little bit shorter then. Like his normal head will be something like this, 40 units down, and then every star you get, we maybe move it like 10 units up, so at the end it will be looking like this. That's by far the stupidest thing in this game, yep. Dude, I wish my autocomplete didn't randomly break every now and then. I might just have to restart VS Code real quick. What? Okay. Okay. Okay. I, what? Oops. Forgot this part. Do I have to get the thing where Blend will sometimes crash and refuse to open until you reboot? No. That doesn't sound very good though. I'll just make sure that this is all of them. There's a clear line here, that's good. I think 80 is the right number. Bits! Thank you for the bits. Computer, it takes 20 minutes to boot back up? Holy shit. Alright, so his head should be slightly smaller than usual now. Maybe I should have been recording stuff, but the absolute chaos of passing keys and Oh, I don't really have a coding style. I do want to enforce the Pascal case on everything like this, but this is like from Vanilla Decomp, right? I didn't make this. At the beginning I just did whatever, but now I'm trying to use Pascal case on everything and this is just Vanilla Decomp stuff. Which I will just ignore. Okay, so it worked, but it ate some vertices that it was not supposed to eat, so we might have to increase this to 90 or so. How do you point everyone at the table? A pointer is just a number. So remember the tweet about how IDEs make pointers pointless? I don't remember ever tweeting that, but maybe I did. I don't know, I don't think coding style is very important, right? Yeah, I can see myself saying that IDEs make it pointless, because you can see the functions are yellow, the variables are blue. Like, what more do you need? Oh no, are we doing a BuzzFeed quiz? Now the question is, do we like that it starts so low? I think it's fine. Although it might be funnier if it starts a little crazier and gets a little crazier in the end. I'm gonna move this up another 10 coordinates. I think that's fine. Which furry Nintendo character are you? None of them. Actually, I am Shadow the Hedgehog. I am all of me. Step into my mystery. Alright, let's collect stars in here and see if it works. Might be fun to collect stars in here anyway. Wait, the fuck? Okay, saloon, secret room, shoot out with the snuffits. Yeah, let's do that. Do I remember you? Yes, Chibui, I remember your name. Most players will only be in the saloon for the first star. It's fine if they miss it. It's just a stupid easter egg, you know? Wait, does the door not work? Did the door break somehow? Say it ain't so. Yeah, I think the door is broken right now. Cool, let's do a different star. Monty Monty. Little bank. I think we do not have the star with the 8-bit pipe. If I make a pointer to a pointer and a pointer to the original pointer, does that make it its own variable? Yes? No? Depends on whether you store. Variable is just a number you store in memory. Or actually, it's not even necessarily that. Sometimes you don't even start them. Someone said that this is too difficult, but it's like. You can do this with so much time left without even really trying hard. Yeah. And speed kicks in this game feel so good. Well, there's no one going stars. So it's a bit annoying to traverse. I think it's really fun. Yeah. Maybe you're right on the scale of Excel Shell. Scala Rex Shell. What is that? But no, it's it's kind of already made for like normal Mario movements. I think I like it a lot, actually. Dry Bones, you guys have the same last name. I see. Really, Scala Rex, the king of skeletons. That sounds like Dry Bones' French name. Oh, yeah. It's finished this month before I die. When will you die? Fucked I shot too early. No, I'm so sorry. I was so useless. Wait. Oh, oh, I see. Okay, we found a bug. Hmm. Hmm. Why did I do this? Here. Fix the bug. I have an idea. You can do shadows or not.  Yeah, it will be similar. We're thinking you can buy stuff for the islands. So you can get upgrades. How does it look without widescreen? Do not worry, my friends. I have made sure it looks fine in normal screen as well. Okay. Let me in. Is it bigger? It's definitely bigger, isn't it? Yeah, okay. It's way bigger. Yeah. What do you mean? We use that idea in some places. Nope. Just from the video. Hello, Mitchell. Alright, his hat is now growing. What do we next? Lower Boshy's pitch? We can do that. And just a bank pitch. Oh, that's how I did it. That pitches the whole bank? Sets it to 32. Is this even used? I think I murdered this at some point. Hey, interesting. Suggesting his pitch won't be that easy. But why is it like this? When did I change this? Ah, this is where the soundbank pitch would be used. Into the town, clock striking 9 and for the Boshy quickdraw. Yeah, that would be cool, but it's not visible enough. We thought about this last week. Yeah, this is what turns sound requests into actual sounds to be played. Why is it resetting to 32 though? This is weird. How's 32 a good default? You know, let's just reimplement the way this works here. And then whatever happens, happens. We only really need this on freck scale. I don't know why it's there on volume as well. It should change everything, how everything sounds. Oh, this does not change anything. What about multiplayer? I don't know how realistic the multiplayer thing still is. Maybe I will still do it, but I haven't thought about it. Audio is clicky. Oh yeah, but that's just a plugin. That doesn't matter. I don't know.  Let's see what happens when I do this. I don't quite understand what's going on here, actually. Okay, good. I have not, I don't want a new emulator. Cool, cool. Do we really want this though? I feel like there's a better way to do this. Because this is a multiplication every time we use a sound effect. And it would kind of blow to have to do this. And I don't like this. I think we should get rid of sound bank pitch. And think about a different way of doing this. Yes, that was on purpose. That was a test to see if that works. And it does. But I don't like this way of doing it. We need to change the frequency scale of this differently somehow. So that we can properly affect the sound effects. What are you trying to do? I'm trying to make sound effects pitchable. Which was a functionality I had implemented before. But the way it was implemented was not that good. Gsoundbanks pitch. There's a gsoundbanks.pitch. Is that how I made it work before? Isn't that in vanilla? No. Not that I would know. I just saw this. Maybe it is here. Maybe it is here. Maybe it is here. Maybe it is here. Do my pitch based on active range. And apply the result on target sample frequency. I don't need to do anything. I will likely just be a multiplicator. Which effectively just moves the octave. Because octave is not rhythmic based. I used minus 30.f here. As in pitch down 30 coordinates. Or 30 halftones. Which I don't actually like. This is kind of like a multiplicator. Where it is divided by 15 again afterwards. Why is this divided by 15 again afterwards? Why not just divide by 480 here? What is this shit? Who programs like this? This is vanilla Mario 64 code I think. I wouldn't do this. Okay. Now if we pass in a pitch that is up to 128. Or minus 127. I think this would be fine. I am just going to change this one here. Wait this also goes by item. Why does the item have a pitch? Where does that come from? That's what we need to find. Audio random plus adjust freq. Adjust freq comes from where? There. Ah. Oh, okay. There. So there seems to be two different systems here. One of which is intended and one of which isn't. I don't think it just bank pitch is supposed to be here. Yep. This is definitely an old one. And this isn't supposed to be here at all. There we go. Okay. We just said the adjust Frank somewhere. And then hopefully this returns to nothing. What are you looking at? Hello, Donna, the bunny. We are making the Yoshi sound pitchable. Basically. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.   Does this have the variable sound flag? Okay. Flex twist the last value here. So we need to set this to zero XC. Probably all the Yoshi should have this. All the Yoshi sounds. Did I invent the system and then never use it? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then it's not being pitched. The system should just be removed. Because this one sucks. Nope. Okay. So this system should be a little more efficient.  It's just being pitched on different reference. Okay. I don't know what you're yapping about. I don't know if you're being serious or if this is just whatever. I don't think we need this. Is there even how the sound is here? The climate sounds. Okay. Okay. So we'll move this in here. The way this is set up and just Frank, we can change it whenever we need to. And by doing that, we can change the pitch of something. And it's almost free of cost unless we are actually changing the pitch of something. That's basically the big idea. Every time you program something, you want it to be free of cost. If you're not using that part of codes. This isn't going to work because it's already playing the sound. Was it just bank pitch and vanilla thing? Oh, well, it is gone now. Depending on first. What? Please do not ask questions like that. Where's Leela? Leela has internet problems right now, but she was on YouTube earlier. Hello, Eskil. Hello, Kek Honka Honka. Let's see if the Yoshi. Oh, the Yoshi doesn't spawn when you get the star already. Shit. So we can't even test it like that. Oh, that sucks. That sucks. Oh, there's a better way we can handle this. I just realized. We can just always set that. Like so. And then just reset the frag. That's perfect. Why does it set the pitch anyway the first time? Because it can't just be undefined, right? It actually might. It may actually just be undefined by default. That would be insane. That would be like a crazy bug we just prevented. I wanted you to see the video I commented on here a few times. I want to program. Lay flags. That's the second variable. How's the set on the Yoshi sounds? Get set to zero. This should be fine. Let's just make Boshi always spawn just when you experiment here. You already have the next level planned out? Not quite. But I realized today there's more on this level missing than I thought there was. But I might still have it done by next Saturday because I'm going to have a week off this  Maybe I'll even do like a bonus stream or two if I can and I'm in the mood for it. We'll see. All right, let me hear Boshi. It didn't really sound lower to me. Let's see. What if we just set this to 48. Just for the experiment. The frequency of the sound half as low and it should be very visible now. I may have just not noticed it before probably. Sounds straight ass. What? Why are you ripping off Lauter and Bjarnhofzinger's mirror? I don't think I am. What is a bespoke sound effect, B-Turk? The next course, I'm not entirely sure yet. I know course 14 is going to be a space arcade. And I've already made an area for it. Okay, there was something there, but not all of it. Okay, okay, it did something. I love you, Snow Course. Maybe a side level. Is this for already existing sound effects, the code I'm editing here? This might be already. Yeah. Um, and well, I guess the pulse pointer is the same, but it is a new sound effect. What about the ones that are not new ones? Wait, this is almost the same code here. Why is this duplicated? This shouldn't be duplicated. Uh, wait, start sound. Let's clean up some code here. We do not want duplicated code. But before I do that, let me verify this actually works as I want it to work if I move this here. Okay, it honestly just feels like you're yapping on about a random subject that has almost nothing to do with what I'm doing to make yourself look smart, and it's kind of annoying. Because what you're saying seems to have very little relation to what we're trying to do here. Uh, yeah, Minty, the compiler is pretty smart. All right, let's listen to this again. Hey, it works! This is what we wanted. There's something. No, this is exactly what we wanted. Uh, next time we'll clean up this code though, because this is not good. I don't like this. This is basically the same code repeated twice. Also, why are we returning here? Should we really be returning here? Is this how the vanilla game does it? I don't think it is. Let me check. This might be a bug I introduced at some point. It may, Lila. That sounds potentially hype. But fun fact, Lila. RTYI is actually RSP bottlenecked. What are you talking about with the unrelated argument? Uh, the code coder guy. Not argument, just like unrelated stuff he's talking about. Yeah, this is not returning me well, actually. It's more like a break than a return, no? I'm still shocked about that, I know. Isn't it crazy? Oh wait, this is a return. Okay, nevermind. All good. For all practical purposes, this is a return. Oh, you're an emulator code caller? Maybe I underestimated you or something, because it just looked like you were talking about nothing that is related to anything I'm doing. You're talking about something about audio mixing. That's not what you're doing. Okay, so this is for existing sounds. So, restart sounds is what we do here. And this is the shorter one, so we will restart this part here, or we will copy this part here. Let me make sure it actually makes the code smaller when I do this. Wait, did I copy this wrong? I may have. Could you improve culling maybe? Save some more RSP? Have it stall the RSP even less? Well, with Sauren's new FBDX3, we are going to be a lot less RSP bottlenecked. See you, Donna. Next Sunday? It's Saturday. I'm a Saturday streamer. Even the computer is lagging. I guess, yeah. Well, you can do that here, too, so... My idea is to apply sound effects. My idea is to apply the engine we have right now to just change the frequency that it provides the RSP. I don't know, Lila. I'm hoping he is. It'd be a tragedy if he wasn't. Let's see, we're at 4A0C. With this, we are down to 495C. Okay, and then lastly, we have to try with this one at the bottom here. So, which parts does this copy? It does not set the pose. It sets the sound bits. It sets adjust freq. Oh, wait. We don't want to do all of this. We just want to do this part here. And the distance computation. Wait, the sound thing updates the position even when the sound doesn't restart. That is interesting. But that makes a lot of sense. Should I continue? Yes, Lila, I should. Can I wish RTY target 60fps on real hardware? Do you know how much less oppressive the game would look then though? I don't want that. It sucks that we have to do it like this. Maybe just this part here should be the insides. Bits. Bits, pitch and status. Okay. This is what we want. Bits. Guys, amazing news. We saved free instruction from all that. But not just that, we also have the code to be easier to work with now. Isn't that amazing? Now let's make sure we didn't fuck everything over. With the free instructions we just saved. Is the audio better? Well, we don't have it. Red still working on it. Have you ever seen Red finish anything ever? Come on. How's the giant Yoshi egg moving like that? Strong wins. Alright, the Boshi pitch has been lowered.  And we got rid of a bunch of useless audio stuff. Very nice. We cleared up some stuff. Audio engine has a new feature where we can actually pitch individual sounds. Very happy with this. There's one thing I want to change. And that is, I want the text boxes to be able to supply the pitch. Because if we don't have that, we have an issue. Because like, how are we going to pitch down character voices? Let's program that real quick. And then we also make it so that Boshi's text boxes have a sound. It's even lower. It's very easy to change. If we want it even lower, we can just change this to minus 90 or something. Insane hack, Leela. Keep going and you can go all the way down to 2 kilograms. I bet Leela is like, maybe 5 grams of protein IRL. You need to implement that sort of stuff as custom sound comments for the day. The work faults. I can literally do it right now. Alright, we need the voices. 398, this is when you cheat. Let's see, what sound fits him cheating? The crying Yoshi, I would say. 398 Boshi after Mario loses? Maybe the pump sound? Or maybe the wiki? So in this case, a client switch or something? Or will regular Visual Studio work? I don't want to use regular Visual Studio. I already used it for work. Well, you're on the text box. If you're on the text boxes, you should make them good. What's wrong with them? Boshi after Mario wins? Also cry on a cry, obviously. Piano guy. Boshi after accepting? Definitely a pump. Right above the Shy Guy. And then 3-2. Let's also make that a pump just for now. Not the voices. I thought I didn't need those meds anymore. Who's talking to you, Lina? The great thing about this is that I can open it via Ubuntu Terminal. So it's like, you know, directly synced up to my repo properly or something. I don't know how it works. And then right here, we will use the Dialogue ID to pitch down the sound if we want. Hello, Vahai. Innovator. What's wrong with MarginalVS? I use it for work and I don't want anything from my work to show up here because I'm on an NDA. So it's just dangerous for me to open Visual Studio while I'm actually working on stream. That's literally it. Okay, so... Can I clear your stream and stuff? Yeah, but I don't want to do that every time I stream. You know what? Before I make a change like that, let me just commit once. Stream Dialogue Rewards. And time 2 is gonna go so hard. You know the worst part is I'm not even allowed to make jokes because someone might take any of the jokes I made about that serious. Otherwise, I would be shitposting with you. Yes, we are developing bionic penises and gifts for breakfast. You figured it out. Okay. Alright, that should be the pitch number. Hopefully, it's not compiled. Oh, no. It's the dialogue to find.        A brock pass 7 arguments but just takes 6 text it's in define text line 56 I should include the pack 0 enough, i dont need this hey, it compiled i dont know what koto devil is whats jetbrains? i dont know these programmer words, i just program dude, my fucking vs code broke again what, what, what, what the hell? dialogue pitch undefined type dialogue entry, oh im missing the ingame menu.h alright and now we should be able to pitch down boshi's sounds like this alright, lets see if it worked oh no i didnt, right we wanted to look at your stuff and your yoshi reps oh it worked let me make sure that the normal yoshi is not fucked by this he is not, nice, nice, nice we implemented this free of cost, very nice well not entirely free of cost, it costs a little bit when you actually open a dialogue but who cares alright, lets see what bturk thinks is the better dialogue for the yoshi reps is this all 17? it changed the comments uh oh, it changed the save state you know this is occurring in the timeline, such an attack is not fine save states are rude, they ruin my mood. So listen up dude, I have a few, I come in peace, I mean rain, but I've seen you using save states, my expertise, you can beat the game with ease, if you cheat again I'll have to break your knees hmm this cellops here dont fit in the rap, you know? with expertise, thats just 4 cellops, next time think about, wait actually, next time think about not doing that please, I'll have no other option, you'll have to break your knees I guess its 2 lines here per rap, with expertise you can beat the game with ease, ok I actually kinda like that then, so think about, next time think about not doing that please, thats 9 cellops, with expertise you can beat the game with ease, thats 11, I think that works just hire eminem, true, actually you know what, eminems lyrics are not good, have you ever looked at them, look at this, little gay looking boy, so gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy, you witnessing a massacre, like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy, always gay, that voice gay, thats all they say, looking boy should read the last line of fuck and will change your mind, what is that? I will just say safe state then, with expertise you can beat the game with ease, but if you cheat again, I'll have to break your knees, yeah I like that, go ahead look it up, is fuck also by eminem, fuck eminem lyrics, oh god damn I'm gonna fucking, what's the last one, shove a gerbil in your ass friend too, what is a gerbil, what are you, are you using chat gpt to write these text messages, just copy, no I'm not gonna copy paste them, I'm gonna use my own judgement to see what I think is better, look what a gerbil is, ok gerbil, oh what, next one, I've noticed a crack in the timeline, blah blah blah, I come from yoyo yoshi, I come from space, I know you're a good guy, but just in case, safe states will soon ruin your fun, if you keep using them I've got a gun, house is different, come from space, I know you're a good guy, but just in case, safe states will soon, ok fine I can do that, I've got a gun, alright, is there any other typos you fixed, yeah this is pretty nice, I like it, the new one at the end had one or two gpt lines, oh I didn't mean you with chat gpt, I meant code coder, cause he's just saying the most random things ever, it's like someone went into chat gpt and was like, wait, let me try this, pretend to be a knowledgeable programmer in this twitch chat, he is hacking an n64 game right now and programming sounds, just caught up with what's happening, are we trying to inject custom sounds into the game or modify existing ones, wait it's doing a whole roleplay, but yes this is the vibe I'm getting here, alright, what's up, I'm a space rapper from far away, using safe states is never ok, oh wait, you added this an extra line, wait this doesn't work, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, yeah it has to be 8 exactly, otherwise it doesn't render right, I'm a space rapper from far away, using safe states is never ok, your star count is cheated and inflated, do it again, you'll be eviscerated, ok I like this but I have to change the lines here, which is fine, we can fix it, what's up, I'm a space rapper from far away, yeah I think that works, next one, I'm the safe state Yoshi, I observe space time, I come to you with a wicked sick rhyme, if I see on my radar that you've safe stated, your life privileges will be confiscated, yep this is perfect, I believe you code coder, but what is this random stuff you're talking about, you're just saying things with no context that are not even true, that's something an AI would do, I'm an alien Yoshi and I'm immortal, ok I like the extra I end here, I've come to you through a space time portal, saving your state was one big blunder, do it again and you'll be 6 feet under, yeah this is better, agreed, the syllables are better this way, I'm Yoshi from the time patrol, I watch over space time, that's my role, I've seen you save state from inside a wormhole, this one doesn't flow well I think, if you keep doing that I'll shut down the console, well it's still good, it's like the rapping can't be good, it has to have that 90s educational rap flow, no no no I want this guy to go hard, no like I said I believe you, what do you mean why should I be lying, I said I believe you, you're just saying the most random things and I don't understand why you're doing that, are you trying to grab me, what do you mean, I don't understand, I'm a space time Yoshi and a UFO, save states are bad don't you know, I don't like cheetahs living in my universe, oh I don't like people, okay yeah that's better, save state again and you'll be put in a hearse, I forgot what a hearse is, now this one might be more lines is it not, one two three four five six seven eight, okay perfect, I'm an alien Yoshi from another dimension, I got something to say, I require your attention, save state again, no matter the intention, okay this one's good, that's what they use to transfer coffins caskets to a funeral, oh oh, these pros surely go hard, yep this Yoshi is very aggressive, I'm a Yoshi and a spaceship, I tr... wait that's the wrong one, a Yoshi in a spaceship travels through the stars I'm coming to your planet to spit some hot bars, Seastating ain't cool bro, I thought you knew that, you keep doing it and you'll become my doormat, yeah this is fine, Space Yoshi's rhymes are interplanetary, better listen to me I can get really scary, if you make me travel through another supernova I'm gonna make sure that you get a game over, it's especially threatening because you can't game over normally in this game, how are you detecting save states for this, there are some emulator things you can do, the emulator when you save state it doesn't actually save the EEP ROM because otherwise if you load a save state you would lose some progress right, so if there's a mismatch between the EEP ROM and what the game is doing right now then we can just trigger a save state detection, setman I'm space Yoshi, I'm a cool Yoshi and my rhymes are sick, oh this one's completely replaced, if you use save states I'll hit you with a brick, save states are gross and cheating is vile, if I catch you in the act I'll delete your save file, yep this one's great, I'm all the way from the moon so you better listen to my tune, don't use save states even once in a while or I'll sentence you to death without a trial, I'm a Yoshi and a satellite, I travel at the speed of light, I come to you with important advice, if you use save states I'll shoot you twice, do these still compile, I feel like oh yep they still do, it's very easy to ruin the formatting here so that's why I wanted to make sure, save state Yoshi that is my name, spitting hot reps is the reason I came, save state abuses, you losers are lame, do it again and I'll turn off your game, yeah that works better than I'll show you pain, this is good, okay wait you made two more, what is this, missing with time and that's a crime, I'm dropping these rhymes to keep you online, save state Yoshi, keep being real, cheat one more time and it's game over, deal, save scumming ain't cool, you're breaking all the rules, you're messing with fate, it's a real crime, I'll feed you to Rana if you cheat one more time, this one doesn't really work, the amount of bars here is wrong, is this the chat GPT ones, VTARG, these two, so I mean I didn't really plan on having these so I could add them if you really want them but if they're just AI generated maybe I don't want them, especially the last one that doesn't really work, and this one didn't deal, I feel like it doesn't flow very well either because there's such a long break here, all right now that we have VTARG's updated dialogues in here and we finished pitching Boshi, there's a few things missing, mostly the trains and adding the chain chomp and the signs and some 3d modeling but I think this is a good point to stop for today and I will see you guys in the next stream, bye bye!
