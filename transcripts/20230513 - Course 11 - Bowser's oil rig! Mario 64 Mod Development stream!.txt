I'm gonna switch headsets and we're gonna get course 11 open hmm wait my chat is not loading or it's just no one here that might just be no one here okay you know what i think my chat's not loading let me just f5 hello externomite hello ask hello externomite again hello richton hello neilman yep my chat was just bugged um i'm gonna be watching robots premiere in a bit so we'll do a live react on stream hello cullen hello externomite for the third time hello segwell uh i just finished rendering the video here about mario's movement not being perfect that will be an interesting watch i hope let's try to do some 3d modeling hello mario luigi sm64 oh shit you are a member wow holy shit you're one of the few with the x symbol what from here rovide is announcing a release date for in his hack i don't know why he's announcing an announcement but here we go do you fix brj's new hack no what ost shall we listen to today so we do have to make some basic platforms here yeah so this is actually going to be a bit difficult because now that we switch to the oil rig theming we need some new platform ideas this is going to be a bit difficult to pull off oh well mario bros ds came out after the n64 so that is not a thing we can do tetris pizza tower eh yo thank you for the two dollars dutos very appreciated hmm right some bullies on the steel burst stuff like that rayman ost i don't like pizza tower i think i'm not sure i think i listened to it before we're just gonna listen to rayman hello franco dubo good saturday right so the whole volcano theme is gone now we want it to be something like this uh maybe we should look at more oil rig well we want the airships to be landing here as well so how would an airship landing strip look like let's make one of those as a platform first shake mario bros not super mario bros roger chris with a luigi clone or something now we already have mario bros new haircut it got too long i always cut my hair when it gets long all right so we got the main ship area mission one two three four and five oh my god there's a lot of missions for one area tear dump the underwater area oh okay so there's just one long pipe here okay we also need the main plaza neither can i to be honest how do these beams connect to the floor and rico harbour oh like that that looks cool let's make something like that so okay we're gonna react to this first though we've all been waiting for this it's an 11 hour game all right when the moon moved on to better things when the dragon was forced to cut off its wings when the world had all virtue and well can't read it out loud that fast so all right so you go back to the castle and explore it that's a very cool way to start off your romeg does romeg has a writer oh those trees are hideous so that's an interesting effect with the moon in the sky  i do like this it looks like a fucked up version of peaches castle and an alternate way to climb it is also really cool so it's kind of weird that everything here is fuck but then the door is just like glowing in the dark should probably fix that before release using demeroy is so cool for a romeg intro though friday like next friday you're releasing it the week after birth of the wild robot oh what are you doing everyone's gonna be playing brother wild it is looking very cool though hello deathpool yeah i'm looking forward to this the way this is uh introduced is really cool  a pretty balls is released at the same week as brother wild though yeah so oh my gosh they called wednesday anam what the fuck am i reading so it's gonna be coming soon because of robots coming on another idea stream he said that the game is done and only music is left yeah i i figured it was coming soon too i just didn't think he would release it a week after rather wild because that's uh dangerous marketing wise but now it's too late nintendo also has a habit of going after ROM hack right after they release their own games so that is a pretty ballsy move to do what's the concept of several this is bowser's airship place they produce airships here and this is where they take off and stuff so this is going to be a level full of bowser's minions working here and you're gonna be messing with them basically so all of the optimization in the game source code already modified the console in some way it's all in the games code i'm not modifying the console for modifying the console we might as well just be playing on emulator you know it'd be pretty pointless at that point not this sack retro gamer it was rovet sack so my heck is okay the name is weird i'm planning to call it return to yoshi's island 64 that's the current name but like it might not be the most searchable name so if we could do engine optimizations here but if you could overclock the console encodes i mean if you could also measure the temperature of the console and go i guess you could do that and make sure to always stay at a safe temperature but i don't think you can if we had a 16 megabyte expansion pack i wouldn't even help  actually if you had 16 market megabytes we could probably put an mp3 instead of wav files and decode the mp3s into the additional 8 megabytes that'd be like one thing we could do like we would decode them during load time although that would probably cause really long load times i'm looking for a nice rock texture here this one looks kind of neat you should blame me on the curse mirror when it comes out i usually don't like playing games on stream because when i play a game on stream i don't feel like i can actually just focus on the moment you know okay uv mapping this is gonna be a different type of challenge isn't it nope that's actually kind of decent looking the rarest move of edge shading depends on what the thing is the first test stream i've made it to gotta say this is sick i'm glad you enjoy it so there we go so we want something kind of like this yeah i like that what is it supposed to be and this is going to be like bowser's oil rig kind of kind of not sure hello persona cartoon split free cartoon split free cartoon split free what what am i missing what is cartoon split free is that the spongebob noise when they do like the face close up what am i gonna do when i release rty um nothing oh yeah i slightly changed the watercolor what do you think why is the car nice playing don't worry about it it's theoretically possible to make i don't know maybe even if there was one though what would be the point do you like the new color i made it less black and a little bit of a blue tone to it that's supposed to be oily water yeah okay but farsana think about this what if we use the extra eight megabytes to decode mp3s into wav files during runtime like on load time we could save us some rom size yeah i changed the color because it looked too much like lava sure but how about not being a complete affront to god wow how do you get the wavy effect mathematics all right okay i'm actually having trouble coming up with the layout for this see the thing is we need big white platforms for characters to stand on but what kind of design would we use for big white platforms here what is blue now i added an nth color aspect to this so now i can add a base color to it right because it was too dark before i think so i added a bit of blue to it i think this is like 5 0 22 rgb wise hello hanker cranes we definitely want cranes we can just model assets and see how they stick together poses iric is not the actual name this is gonna be all names in this game are like cool alterations like bunny brushwoods we got a rainbow grotto which is just a rhyme we got uh all alone bubble dome which is also just a rhyme we got wario's wildlife valley no war is a wildlife world which is an alliteration we got uh ghoul guy galleon so frantic fleet factory is the current name i'm thinking of i guess let's just make a fucking crane and see what happens since the water here seems to be around this height a bit more i'll just do this so we actually have a better view of what's going on here so on some platforms the classic mario enemies are turned into a stone like shanker scooper etc you mean like statues of mario enemies absolutely not i don't like this platform here at all i think this platform here is garbage i like a lot of the rico harbour assets i think we should go with something like this the ship in rico harbour is pretty cool and i would like if we could use something like that this is not lava it's water don't worry about what it looks like here statues but moved into platforms i am having a hard time imagining that i like the helicopter strip here we need a landing strip like this for the flying boats we made the only version of tiny island you should have been there when we were planning level themes something like that was on my mind bozo's sticky structure well it's not an alliteration what's another word for a bozo same word for bozo with s you said should we start the level a landing pad for the bowser blimp yeah yeah something like that is what i'm thinking actually now that i think about it so this platform here was intended to be right before the pipe that leads to bowser so having his blimp landing pad here would be perfect i guess that's where he lives and that's also the perfect place for the riot to happen so let's find some good references for a blimp landing pad well i guess blimps don't really use landing pads huh you can't make it on yourself well we have cooper carnival we have one letter off do not google bowser blimp on google worst mistake of my life so if it's a landing pad for a blimp i'm guessing the size here is not good because it should be more cuboid I want something like this, I think, pad-wise. Should be a clown blimp. Yeah, yeah, that could kind of work. I could see that. Oh, that reminds me, I still wanted to add some of the clown blimp enemies to Bowser level, right? Not clown blimp. Where are they? Where is the idea? Evil Flying Clown has the idea of fire ground on top to destroy. This part is missing. I just now realized. I still also need to do the end cutscene, but I was waiting for the animations for Zeina first. They took a while. Yeah, we're kind of having a big design document here. Oh, right, Leela, you're coming to make me realize I want to change something about Course 1. Here we go again. I know, I know, here we go again, but look, my idea for Course 1. Look at the first star in Course 1. So you kind of go along here, go along here. Initially what it was, is that there was just a line to get to the end there and that star was like way too short. So I added a bit more to it, but you learn how these work here, which I think is already an improvement, right? Like this is fun, but I was thinking, I was thinking we're going to add something else. We're gonna, over there, I'm going to put a tree and you're going to walk onto the tree and then on the tree, there's going to be another one of those plants. And then the windmill there, I'll move the windmill right behind this lock here, right? And then you just spin on top of the windmill and the star kind of just takes you around the whole level like that, with a lot of vertical platforming. What do you think? I do not support the Rumbleback now. Let's make it able to climb out for a first level. I don't know about that. Trees fucking suck. I mean, yeah, it could be a mushroom. I don't know. I think that's like a nice amount of verticality to it. More space. Now, if I add space, I want the space to be filled with goods. Okay, so this is going to be where the blimp lands. The problem I have with that is that we don't just want this to be a big cement block. Yeah, of course, one star one would just be Desert Burst. Giant Carrot. Giant Carrot in the middle of the level is a bit much, I think. The landings don't have to be alliterated. They have to be alliterations, or rhymes, or any other stylistic metal that is like burned into your brain when you read it the first time. I mean, maybe if you look at more oil rigs, we'll find something. These are kind of just standing on thin platforms. If that's a legal move, I'll just do that, I guess. I mean, that kind of looks like it's holding it, but I feel like we're wasting our potential for visual diversity here. If we use the same anchor points, you know. I don't know Donkey Kong Country naming scheme. At least no desert courses in a sec. Not really, not yet. The next level plant is a Wild West course, so that's going to be kind of a desert course. It's going to be about catching bad guys. I kind of like these oil rig holds here. We could do something like that, just have like one thing in the middle that's holding the whole platform up. Multi-language support is possible, and there's a good chance we'll have that, because there's this really annoying guy called Rionu, and he just won't leave me alone, and he says he's going to translate that. Never heard of him. Yeah, if you want to know who he is, you have to, like if you want to ask ChenGBD who he is, you actually have to put in Rionu, the Mario 64 hacker, for ChenGBD to understand. And since Leela is a bot, that makes sense. Now that I've mentioned that he's a Mario 64 hacker, do you know him? You could add another element to the theme, like a giant fucked up vine or shrimps growing from the oil. I like the idea of adding another theme to it, yes, but I don't think shrimps is the idea that we're looking for. Actually, 30. It's probably best we just make a few random assets for now, and then just see how we can combine them to look good. This is usually not how we make levels, but for this level, it might be the best. Oh, I like big rocks, yeah, yeah, yeah, big rocks would make this a lot easier to work with. Fuck it, big rock it is. Obviously, the rock has to be a bit pretty in the end, it can't just be this, but still. 8 bits? No. What the fuck are you saying? Could one of the rocks be really tall and have the riot landing pad from all the way at the top of it? Hmm. It's like almost a mountain. So you just put a fucking mountain down here? I kinda like it. Okay, but if we put a mountain down here, we should probably plan the first area a little bit. So this was the initial plan. Obviously, this is not happening. Very obviously, this is not the plan anymore. So let's paint up something new. We got everything is the ocean, okay, everything. And we need one area just for the red coins, just somewhere off. Probably like, let's just move it down here. Okay, we got the mission one area where you mess with everyone. This is where they work. This could be like down. So floor level. Mission one. This is floor to top level with a lot of verticality. And then on the floor level here. Floor level is mission for power generator, right? Ocean spires. All right, let's see an ocean spire. Oh, that looks really cool. Yeah, yeah, I like that. And okay, this is mission one. Mission two is where they are on a strike and you operate a crane to break a big Bowser statue. Okay, just to give you guys an idea, this is going to be where the red coins are going to be. Around this area is where you mess with everyone. Power generator is going to be down here. Operating the crane and breaking the statue. Okay, I think the Bowser statue should be in the middle of the whole level then. Cockroach wreck. Statue can be carved out of one of the spires. Oh, that would look really cool. Space Hitler? Who's Space Hitler? Bowser statue. It's going to be on the floor. Floor level and blimp pad top level. So the thing is, you're not supposed to be able to destroy the Bowser statue until they start striking. So we have to block the crane that destroys the Bowser statue somehow. For that we're probably going to have thwomps that would usually block you during mission one. But during mission two, they just let you go into the crane. We could have a crane climb mission. So that the whole level or the whole mission would be inside the crane. Which could be really cool. It could be really tight platforming. Like a thin upwards crane. I think it would look cool. You guys on board on that? Should I un-use mortis enemies but not just chuck your bully clone? I don't wanna. That's an area of fossils. Why? So the crane entrance has to be... Right here I think. Oops. The statue looks like this. It has oil pouring out of its mouth. Oh shit! What is this? Starman doesn't have a mission where you climb inside the crane. It will be fun. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. So one, two... Mission three is here. Mission four is here. Mission five is this. Mission six is the 8-bit pipe under the water. This is perfect. This is all we need. Don't worry about it. Since we are planning on doing this... Let's move this somewhere else. This looks cool. Oh, this with oil pouring out of its mouth. That would look really cool. And then with the crane you just behead him and get the star. So I'm using Pearl for testing my romec and now I can run my roms and it won't crash. Nice! Should we go to some bones that float in the lava? Oh, it's Bowsa and you get a stalker gromp on each one. No! I don't want that. That is way too dark for this level. This is supposed to be like Bowsa's stupid oil rig. There's no evil stuff going on here. Well, I mean, other than Bowsa. So since we are... Oh God, this is where the level is. This probably fits best somewhere in the mission one area. Since we want the big Bowser statue in the middle of this level, let's experiment with ways to make the spire look that doesn't look bad. That is the wrong object. Maybe you can make that destroy the pump, make the oil level grow up and so make... Nope. I don't want random ideas, guys. If you have random ideas, that is great and all and you are free to be creative. But like the probability of me actually putting any of them in is very slim. Maybe they can look at the background and make some markers. That's a very interesting geometry that would be really easy to make look good. I was just gonna make like actual realistic fucking mountains, but... I'm really glad we brought this up, yeah. I'm just thinking about how to actually carve Bowser into this now. Do we want them to be that slanted? I mean, that's kind of cool that they're so slanted, but then how am I gonna make any geometry on this? Maybe they should be slanted like the other way? Let's get some Mario mountains. Yeah, let's kind of make some shit like this. Oh, this is cool too. Oh, I kind of like this. Oh, it's Mario World. Oh my god, look how hideous this is. Oh, that is rough. Same here. Oh, that's a custom level. Oops, I'm sorry. You should not shit on custom levels. You can't shit on Nintendo though. Honestly, I kind of like this. Just like a spiky thing with a few outer layers on it. This is also very cool though. What are other unrealistic types of mountains we can make? I think we have to do a bit of experimenting here to get something we like. I don't know about this. This is not it. We're not adding Mr. Beast to this, I'm sorry. Is it supposed to be a mountain? It's supposed to be a spire. Alright, so something like this is one random idea. I don't think it's good though. So, let's move this somewhere over here. Let's try and see how the mountains from New Super Mario Bros. would look like. I don't know. They're kind of like this. And then the bottom is deleted. And then they're slightly beveled. They're beveled. Like that. This is not that high quality. I know it looks like a lot of polygons, but this whole mountain is like 30 triangles. And then this is scaled down to like 0.7. And then it's a bunch of these next to each other. Which kind of looks pretty cool though. And these seem to converge towards this triangle here. Yeah, I could kind of see this working out. I think the best thing you can do about it is be high quality. Poorly like the background here that was my first idea but it did not look good when I tried some things this level feels like it's starting really rough yeah yeah that's always how it goes let's see how this looks with a good rock texture we probably should just not even bother with the single layer texture just go directly to the multi-texture you should add red goop instead of attack mario but don't do any damage and drop a hold on a keyboard shell like I missed once in mario why would I do that those are just random ideas what problem does that solve designing something is not just about coming up with ideas it's about solving whatever problem you have in design oh you started a new decomp for a new game you just set up the make file and everything is it already shift upon a week on the first two rooms of the aquarium holy shit it's good that you're having fun though I think the zoo has huge potential I looked at it again and I realized that I actually just fucking ruined the colors in it you can send an anger picture of Mario mountains yes that is allowed how courses will deserve yes I mean 15 of course so knowing level in general I think it might sell the ocean vibe a bit more of some ambient sounds like flowing water or seagull noises I think would go a long way yeah that is gonna be in the music though but I agree that those would generally be good never positive impact I think these type of buttons don't look too bad what's we made a ton of stuff from sketch change all things myself and can we change the lighting oh yeah the lighting I kind of ruined that and I think the didn't really have any and what the fuck is that I don't know what happened over there oh it's okay okay it's just bad textures don't worry about it the mountain looks really cool I think I mean are you asking how are those mountains as in how the fuck do you think that what you're looking at there is a mountain or like what do you mean by that so I think this is safe to remove let's actually unrotate these for actually account offense but they just don't look like months well they're kind of inspired from a Mario game and they're supposed to be spires which yeah so we definitely have to get rid of these gaps here now I think it looks very good in game actually so we'd have to carve a Bowser statue into this which I don't really see how that's gonna be possible but definitely double she said that but I made the service of all those arena the aquarium oh this is vario submarine it looks really good yeah I like it a lot how does tessellating the mountains up they do match the ones in the Mario Bros. backgrounds but the question is is this good the most essential would be around here we are this answer the issue that we need this to be really big so if we made all the mountains this style it wouldn't really work because we need this to be like really high up in the air pals us polluted power plants if he was named pals other would work but Bowser's the power plant that's another iteration maybe to eat all different sizes now I don't think it matters really what we do there's no way we can make these slanted and also that big without it looking really weird I do you have to keep in mind like one would have to be like oh actually it's too big but like like this maybe how much is this I think I want this to be like maybe 12 16,000 coordinates actually it's 30,000 yeah that's about a size we would need they don't even have colors yet this is actually all done just via geo nodes we could go for the super marbles color which kind of is like a little bit of a baby blue I guess oh god what this looks terrible coming in idea of using the background from the previous you should smooth shape those doesn't work with geo nodes right as soon as I hide the geo nodes it will work but oh yeah just use edge split I don't want to edge split while modeling here I can use the smooth node though if you want what's the smooth node how's it called maybe I lost it rip I don't use the ambient color that would do a lot it's picking me so sharps sure but I can't even find a smooth node so either way I don't like this because one really cool thing about these is that the inner part is so defined we don't really have to here so we could have a texture that defines the inner part a lot but if we do that then the UV map here is gonna be a bit very stretchy let me just show you what that would look like that's a good rock with an outline I'm sure I have a few textures like that am I gonna use a fucking floor tile texture I hope not okay I guess this kind of works to just see what it would look like that actually kind of looks sick I'm just saying I'm gonna have to change the outside UV map and the rims and I think this would work so it's not gonna be awful for platforming yeah yeah that is also a worry it's gonna be hard to tell the player which which surfaces are standable and which ones aren't unless it's like completely standable now today it's definitely a stream for experimenting with the mountains okay well if you guys need a better texture to be able to evaluate this let's just get you guys a better texture oh wait there's an issue oh I know why okay we do something else let me do something else for quick well that's a big oil rig oil and rig are not an iteration there so nope I have a cool idea that might work so if you had to tell me that this looks like shit I would agree with you but hear me out just wait for a second hmm no I want that the inverse of this I think yeah something like that and then this part of course has to be a UV map differently oh um uh we can do that so this kind of looks even more like the mario bros ones i don't know if it's just me or if it's just the sound of people pooping on me i just hear someone saying people shouldn't be pooping on me okay this is terrible bad this looks unfinished interesting we cannot listen to this one because that's the original style that we were going for it's kind of unfitting with the level because it's still like so bright compared to the rest i'm still not sold on using these mountains though i don't think it's a bad mountain though resnor's rusty rig why resnor? resnor's in this level rusty rig kind of works though um what other mario mountains do we have thank you lila no i don't think this mountain is good this mountain is always gonna have some sort of issue like there's too many issues i can think of let's see those uh what am i looking for here revolution at the rusty rig that would be a good name for the mission but not for the level the top right one this i actually just saw this and this is kind of inspiring in a way because i kind of like this the yoshi mountains what's that there's one mission where they strike yeah but that's not the whole level oh like in the overworld nah i'm not feeling these see what i like about this mountain these mountains here is how pronounced the lines are you see how there's like it's like someone made just like a normal mountain and then drew a few lines into it that's such a cool look let me give that a try i know you feel like what is this this is awful what is this music oh If we keep using so much air The solar power can flow really nice to me You're out of touch, I'm out of touch But I'm out of my head when you're not around You're out of touch, I'm out of touch But I'm out of my head when you're not around You're out of touch, I'm out of touch But I'm out of my head when you're not around  When I'm out You're not around But I'm out of my head when you're not around Manner, Manner Wow Manner, Manner Now let's give the idea that thing gave me a try God, modeling this is gonna be a pain Holy shit Manner, Manner But I'm out of my head when you're not around When I'm out You're not around But I'm out of my head when you're not around Yep, that kinda works I need to be able to shade these individually though That's gonna be an issue If we can't get the smooth shading working on like a few of these individually at a time This is not gonna work Oh great, now we're listening to meme songs I need to get the note I guess cause they're all yellow Oh really, mountains are not yellow Is this the German radio chats? I don't know, YouTube decided to listen to this I don't wanna listen to this Note trees Note tree Shade smooth, there we go Oh, cause I didn't have a fake user Hmm There we go What are you listening to? I don't know I just wanna work But YouTube keeps playing weird songs Lila, how does this work with MarkSharp? It doesn't Maybe add split modifier? There we go How do you just move it up one instead of two first? What the fuck? Oh, like this There we go Alright, there we go Now it is possible Can we listen to Speedcore? I don't think the rest of chat would appreciate that RustyRigRefinery I don't think this is a refinery, yeah That's the issue with that name There we go There we go There we go There we go Honestly, this looks pretty good to me, something like this What was this Blackwater Bay? Ha, Blackwater is interesting Will the planned casino level be a main course? Yes If the plan stands, we don't know 100% that that will be the main course yet Or that that will be a thing at all yet You never know, sometimes you just randomly get a bad idea, you know I don't know Okay Oh my god, can we stop listening to shitty music? I'll put on the Mario Odyssey OST Tales of the Kingdom is exhausting? That's interesting I haven't heard anyone say that yet But honestly, I've been feeling less free in video games as well I don't know a better word than that I feel like there are so many video games where there is no solution right off the bat And I know that I just have to follow these instructions that I have already predefined like months ago to solve the game And it's like I'm not even playing, I'm actually just following instructions I've laid out myself Your puzzles are not exactly special I'm not talking about puzzles Yeah, just in general Like if I boot up Mario Odyssey, I know to just like enter the level and like Let's say it's a cave level, I follow the right wall until I've been everywhere in the level And I just interact with the things that look interactable And that's it That was my game experience Maybe I'm getting old Hmm, the lighting is not as sharp as I'd like I'm supposed to solve what? I just mean like the steps that I'm gonna take are things that I've already decided like before I even played the game And now I'm just sitting there passively doing what I already decided to do months ago That's like not freedom That's not the freedom I want games to give me, you know Maybe freedom in games just doesn't exist Why would I want to play Minecraft? I think you're the only one that does that Maybe I mean, how do you do it? And do you just kind of like go unconscious and let your subconscious decide what to do? Do you not think about it at all? It's a relaxing not-hard experience, which gives you a lot of time to do stuff But you don't do that at home You play the game and have fun without hyper-analyzing how you're doing it? Well, I am hyper-analyzing fucking everything I mean that kind of feels like the way you're supposed to live life This is a mountain, not Yoshi's ice Although I can kind of see the Yoshi ice in this, yes Hello, James What? How many monsters are we gonna take this time? We'll find it out It's still an oil rig, but we're adding rocks so that we have platforms for Mario to actually stand on And to put stuff into I just don't know about mountains like this for actually just standing on them If you make a mountain like this, it never feels like Mario is supposed to stand on anything And you get so many weird spots, which is awkward to move I feel like even if these were nice visually It wouldn't work in an actual game Even those are better for that There aren't many mountains to stand on Mario Bob-omb Battlefield has a mountain Quokka Mountain is literally a mountain Tortoise Mountain is literally a mountain Tiny Huge Island is a huge mountain you climb Like half the levels are just mountains Tortoise Mountain is not a mountain That's all cancel keys for thinking that So if you wanted a place for Mario to stand on We should do something like this And then put a different texture on here Honestly that kinda works I don't know what that is I don't like that I don't want anything mech or marina I mean marina is not bad, but mech? Mines don't make logical sense next to an oil rig Maybe ships or something would be better We were thinking these to be like ocean spires basically Rather than like mountains So I'd have to be like tilted Even cases can't walk We got a Mac Miao from bosses 3 that has paths too Let's see that This is pretty good looking But this feels like it's gonna be very high poly I could climb all the way up here it's kind of cool what about the little ice faces from shovel land you mean those that's like a visual inspiration of them being glaciers instead of mountain or spires what when did I make gay Koopas and support death at least a gay Koopas thing has to be a lie I do not remember making gay Koopas Koopa with cough oh because it's like why are those gay what if I'm missing do I have dementia because I don't understand why the Koopas and Koopa with cough are gay I have dementia dementia that's fair I guess this is obviously not gonna be in the actual texture because it's hideous I just want to see like what kind of impression this makes on me when I go in game I feel like something like this is not terrible I support death which means only one thing whose death do I support or just like death in general I haven't gotten that part yet if you think I donate money to the death factory I own shares in death Inc. yeah so if you have a clear path to walk on here this is not terrible so the spire theming could work it's just that as soon as you go onto the actual mountain this is gonna be fuck I mean you can't save any kind of data in secret Andrus right so in the decomp what we do is we do save it as a C file but like you might as well just save it as a hex file it doesn't make a difference it is all the same yeah obviously we don't want this texture the question is just if we want to go with the spire theming here I'm not really sold on this you know because we do need this to go up like all the way there needs to be like a huge rig around here it's there like a fantasy version of an oil rig see I external might this is interesting I don't like these mountains these and these look kinda cool we could go with something like that yeah let's try that that's actually way better I think I finally have the thing that I want so we've got gump in game open fortress which is an oil rig take a look at that it's pretty looking all right I'm definitely gonna save this link here actually the way I'm gonna model this is gonna be different I'm gonna model just one side of this and then I'm gonna use a modifier to do this this is gonna look very Mario esque as well which is why I like this idea so much and there will be no confusion about where you can and can't stand it's actually had some interesting properties but it's not what we need right now I need this one here and I need my my sideways Shafi rocks did you miss something nope someone just said where did my little texture go I used to section like half an hour ago but I did not remember name and we just had just called to something kind of like this wait I just remembered I have the structure on this court right wait for it nata sent me this texture a while ago is it on my desktop rocky wrench ring well we don't use the rocky wrench enemy here that's actually an enemy in mario 64 if you didn't know or not mario 64 but mario is this a joke in some way no it's not a joke it's 100 serious if you press a you will be game just for today real press B to be a bee today that doesn't rhyme leila that doesn't work press y to be by today and today doesn't rhyme dude okay you know what i think this texture is still on here zaprock rock okay i wonder who made that name we don't need the course name yet we're gonna be working on this for a long time we can come up with the name whenever we feel like it and might just come to me in my sleep you know sometimes you just wake up and there's like random thoughts in your brain during your sleep and you just have a great idea so well yeah but if it's called rocky wrench rig and we don't put rocky wrenches kind of like a scam okay this is finally gonna fry the rsp it's fine this is 14 triangles piece so this would be mario's theme song if he wasn't breaking bad  okay one thing i'm thinking about though is how do we make this mountain taller we can have a mountain like this here and then the koopa statue would just be like at the front which would look really cool the enemies here will be mostly just like normal bowser minions and then the obstacles would be like maybe oil that spills out of like a pipe and hits you maybe jumping poodle boos if you get an enemy other than shy guys this time hey it is yoshi's island we do need to shy guys  okay let's actually just apply the modifiers and then get that and modify this so this is annoying to model let's not do this for now because that's gonna be just too much work for something we might even scrap oops okay all right calm down what the hell it doesn't do this oh there we go is this how we would do this mountain no they're not yoshis the rioting npcs they're all bowser's minions man this whole thing is only like 200 triangles we could have a lot of these mountain rangers around i kind of like them i dig them i think this is what we do we have mountain rangers like that and we have one here one for the building here and one for the koopa stuff That would be one of the weaviest things to do Leela. Keep in mind please that these are not the actual way these platforms are gonna look like. This is just some temporary shit I'm putting together. So that I have a rough idea of what this will feel like in final. I love Super Mario Logans and... Okay, chill. You cannot come in here and call me an Aryan super soldier. You will get my YouTube stream banned. There is not a case monopoly in the modern community. Anyone can just make a hack. I kinda like how big and mighty these walls look. That makes the level feel so big, wow. I mean I guess the level is very big. Keep in mind this is our basic outline. So there needs to be a lot of oil rig stuff here, maybe some small mountains. This is the little monster to the left, this is the big monster to the top. And the reds are gonna be all on oil rig stuff. There is nothing saying a hack that releases won't be as popular as mine. And this is just a feature that's not implemented yet on this. Don't worry about it. There is basically supposed to be a global coin count, but it doesn't initialize right now. Those holes are huge, please increase the UV sizes. What do you mean? Oh you mean on the red platform? I don't think the red platform is actually gonna make it anywhere. I'm not planning to use it. I shaped your child, damn. I was basically a child myself back when you were a child I'm guessing. Still only 27. The white platform is supposed to be just like a thicker platform. We still need to texture this. Let's make a few assets for this and then we can continue on actually putting them together in a way that makes sense platforming wise. Now that I think about it, we should come up with platforming mechanics for this as well. We should have a bunch of moving platforms around. Broken airships, not really platforming stuff. Trains, yes. Platforms on hooks, yes. Hooks, okay. Seesaw platforms, I like that. Shipping containers, okay. Piles of firsts, that probably meant dirt. Construction tunnels, we can't do that. Temporary fencing, yes. Concrete barriers, yes. Zip lines between buildings, I still like that. Cannons that should be in buildings, very cool. Thermal power plant, yes. Now you're 21, oh damn. Yeah, I was like... How old was I when Last of Us came out? 22? Hello, Dario. Yeah, I'm not that much older than you, Lina. Oh, I'm doing a Dario reference. Why is Dario talking about Mario's... Whatever the fuck that is, ancestry. His eyes are exactly those from Philosopher's King's Explorers. Okay, having the eyes of a king is not a compliment. Most kings were like insanely inbred. And being anything like a king is not a compliment. Being like a king, phenotype-wise, is an insult. Is the current king of England an inbred? I don't even know. Wasn't there some crazy thing about the queen before that like... Her aunt was like also her mom or some shit? The Dutch one is? Okay. Let's see. Is the queen of England inbred? Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were both third cousins and second cousins once removed, which does constitute a mild amount of inbreeding. Ah, okay. So they were not dead inbred, just a little. Just a little bit of inbreeding as a treat. Haha. Haha. Toads are not Bowser's minions, so... That won't work. Toads aren't in, you know. What's gaslighting? Gaslighting. This is kind of a cool texture. Let's rescale this to N64 size and see if we can make it work. Yeah. Needs to be sharper than that.  No, this looks like shit. I wonder if there's like a good AI downscaler. Like if different shape with different color. They aren't going to be wearing helmets because they're workers, so you don't actually damage them. It is entirely possible that one of my textures is from Spongebob. The texture would be good if it wasn't so associated with the DioDioDog sub. No, downscaler, not upscaler. Okay. I think this texture could work with some small adjustments. Yeah, I think this works well. I have no idea where I got this texture. I think this is a pretty beautiful template for a platform to look like. I just really hate the stone here. Stone just kind of ruins it completely. And it also should be this nice. Actually, should it be this nice royal purple? Should it be a multitext? I don't think so. This texture just really doesn't work with this rock here. This rock is just not giving me the Mario vibes, you know. I've recently noticed that people started just saying it's giving X. They omit who the object and who the receiver of the thing is. I'm a bit confused. What's up with that? I think it's one of those weird Zuma slangs. These are not Brolier Mountains. Look at that mountain. I will look at the mountain in a second. I want metal squares instead of stone hills. I don't think it works. If I rotate this 90 degrees, it's kind of pretty. All right, so you think this is bad? I think it looks fine. I feel like I want a more simplistic, less grainy texture here. That is too simplistic and too not grainy. You know what I mean, though? I don't see the issue right now. It's behind me. Look at the front of the big mountain. You mean the random fucked up UVs here on the geometry that isn't finished? This is not going to be like this in-game at all. Don't worry, I'm going to completely remake the mountain. I just want the basic layout here so I can actually start working on this level. There we go. So what's the shape of the big mountain you want to unsee? Why? Do you see cock and bolts or something? I don't see cock and bolts. Do you see cock and bolts in there? Really? I think that might say more about you than about the mountain. Okay, I think this idea has potential. It's just something about this texture that's not resonating that much with me. But that might just be because there's no depth to the texture. Of course there's going to be depth in the 3D model. Vertex colors are definitely going to make it better, yes. I don't think that's the issue though. Will the texture have color like in the Bomb Factory? No, I think we're better off just plastering vertex colors about this. This is so subdivided that that strategy is not really worth it. Cobble reefs. I definitely like the idea of adding cobbles to this. The problem is though, this level is going to be very high poly. This level is going to absolutely murder the triangles. So if we add cobbles to this as well, it might end up being too much. We're definitely going to do some shit like vertex colors at the bottom though. Let me see how this looks real quick. Hello, RGTF2. How's CPU right now? CPU is fine. Skipping all animation logic on cowl vertices is an interesting idea. We could subdivide the ocean at all to do that. Oh yeah, that is much better. Yeah. I actually touched grass yesterday. Me and Zeina, we went out and we made a cool... We made a terrarium in a closed jar. I just wanted to make one. See what happens. All right. This is it for today. I'm probably going to be working on this over the week. I'm going to start making some actual layouts in here. The first goal is going to be to just make a bunch of assets. We're going to make a crane, make some containers, some platforms. And then we're going to see how we can combine them to make interesting platforming. And then we're going to slowly build the level. Right now, we're still just shaping up the level so that it can become a decent level. I will see you guys next Saturday. Until then, bye bye.
