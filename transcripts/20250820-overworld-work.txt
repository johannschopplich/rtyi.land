thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you this is where the seashaw needs to go well a lot of people do seem to be into it it's honestly crazy how much people are into it hello wing cap man the most twitchlessest game on steam? that's kinda crazy any ost wishes? i want silly gooba music every superstars music? maybe? how about goopy curvy music why is it one two oatmeal? i googled goofy curvy music alright well i guess this is it let's take a look at it okay i need to refactor this this is fucked up we can't have this for the seagulls but i like the idea of putting seagulls into the overworld we should do that hot bomb rusher cyberpunk? no this is fine this is gooba music what a triumph is that no way man that's such a triumph this is gooba music alright let's see it hello cavezito they're calling it the best triumph anyone has ever seen no way no this isn't gonna work 400 units okay that should give us a big range of ground pounds yeah that's a seagull where is it dude that would look so cool if we just had a bunch of these floating around in the background imagine like 15 of these just flying by that would do so much for the game this game is too complex to run on the ps1 for sure right i know oh yeah have you seen these graham made me some pretty nice textures for these guys and then i made some edits to the model and made a shader for it okay i would say uh the instructions work perfectly and there's a relatively wide range of where ground pound is valid okay nice this should lead to the ice cap oh the no graham didn't do the rocks graham did the hills hello esco i won't be able to find the cell there's going to be a message in the bottle zaina's working on the bottle right now and it's gonna just gonna be stuck here next to the ice cap it's gonna be sparkly so you go towards it and there will be a hint that's like stand in the middle of the rock formation look at the big red friends out of the three brothers or something like that and do seven backflips no but biobank is actually working on that level right now the ice cap course i also had the first beta test of course nine done uh koopa wave kulf and the reception was pretty positive which is good there were a lot of things i need to change but actually that means i need to update the tracker document i keep forgetting to update the milestone tracker that puts gameplay testing to 15% and i think we can give this one 58% uh 48% dead is the wrong level what oh it's peach secret slide duh zaina did you do any progress on the the thing the message in the bottle if not then we're going to do seagulls first let's do seagulls not yet all right time for seagulls then so okay how do we best do the seagulls the thing is i want the seagulls to work without me having to do too much work on everything so we need to give the seagulls some kind of path to go around but i also don't want them to all be on the same path or the same size so let's do a seagull in it thing here this is all garbage this is complete garbage also garbage so so what we'll do you know it's fully controllable with the b parameters the thing is um we probably want them to go in an arc from either side to the other so we kind of need to define a spawn point and a despawn point maybe we should make a seagull spline and then have the seagulls go along the spline and spawn randomly on the spline with random offsets on the spline points sounds good to me let's do it so then we also should do a seagull spawner actually should we do that maybe not let's not do that i have an idea so we'll have them spawn behind the hill here move here we probably want them just outside the bounds of the level like so then around the side here dancing dinos may be fitting for this hello pachu true if the dancing dinos sing with the stream that'd be pretty banger uh the x turn doesn't say the size of the thing oh that's kind of rough okay well i guess we can't help that let's send the bottle is this a rework of the bottle let's see it we can get to that after the seagulls then oh you sent the blend one file not the blend file it's the wrong file it's going pretty well watch a little bit and you'll see awesome stuff so what are you working on hello sanitizer i am working on making seagulls work in the background right now so all right i can show you real quick what they look like right now and what we want to do we'll do it okay right there so we have this little seagull actor here they're supposed to be silhouettes that kind of fly around in the background they're the goonies from yoshi's island and we want them to fly around the island at the top there that's what we're working on right now and also we're working on a message in a bottle that tells you how to get to the secret level with the ice cap which is going to be the next thing we do say that just made this model for us can you make the message stick out of here the bottle is nice but i need the message to stick out at the top i think that would look a little nicer also i think this makes it you know what i mean i don't want the cork in there because i want mario to be able to read the message immediately but yeah it's the glass itself looks great i like the color a lot i like this is easier i'm not sure if the texture works at all you know i think that might need to be like a 3d mesh that seagull sounds i think there are already some in the lst for this level okay so now we also need to pick a random place for them to be so i'm right shifting this by eight because of a project 64 bug that i want to work around i wouldn't need to do this usually so wait let me think about this there's one spline point when there's zero spline points this is zero when there's two spline points then this is two so this is going to be one too much right yep it is remix canvas do you typically use the center does it depend on the level it depends on the level so for here i just made like an icosphere but then some levels are just like a half dome do do it'd be plus one oh there's plus one do this function doesn't follow my coding guidelines so i'm just renaming that i'm sure this game is ready like 95 ish 90 something like that hard to say is there enough coming yes maybe four five six seven eight nine ten eleven eleven seagulls for this area sounds good to me for now maybe i should have added a seagull spot now oh well do hello tea time do okay we have seagulls now and they are at randomish positions but they're not distributed the way i want them to be that just doesn't look good something went wrong and i know what it is how we're doing yes it is entirely based on the goonies from yoshi's island wait what the fuck do um okay they're all gone especially behind the mountain all of them hmm do are you faking it i like yoshi's island i played that game a lot in my childhood never 100 of them the percentage of minimum product version of heck is left to be done by you is taken by finishing world when did you have a stroke typing that can you try again do let's see if we deducted the correct amount of spline points seven yep there's seven points okay hmm random plot is zero to one it is i'm faking it call me yandere dev what is going on well okay one thing we need to do for seagulls is disable backface culling so let's just make sure that is a thing i also need to re-export this look at what they did to my seagull here do do do do do do do where did i store it probably in the old w1 photo actually uh-huh do i mean from now to finishing the heck excellent text and biomech rework what percentage of work will have been taken by finishing your world i'd say 80 do do do this is not a castle grounds actor this is an overworld bang actor but i'll check one second let me finish this first i think i used group 12 do and it's do do again and i actually gained a lot of ram soon with the script that someone made for me someone 2639 that's his name his name is very confusing how would you just call yourself someone any dream where you made one side that was night themed and i had like 10 dreams about the sack that's crazy probably had more dreams about the sack than me then do do but make them in color i think it's too easy to confuse them with mouse or that's fine i don't care if you confuse them with grouse do do do hello graham i just showed them the mountains you made we should make a light level right now not right now but there's a lot of side levels i still need to make and honestly i'm kind of hoping i can get a few people to help me with those that's so much work and marty is already helping with one side level he's been putting so much work into it it's gonna be the biggest side level i think i was thinking all the side levels would be like minimal and just single mechanic based so we can have some recurring mechanics instead of having them only be used once oh they're all here is that all of them now there's one here too oh do you prefer level and or star in terms of looks graphics how they play or just something that you're proud of how it turned out my favorite star might be the piranha plant boss fight just because of how visually impressive it is or the maybe the bowser one boss fight but i haven't beta tested it yet so i fear it's actually going to be jank as hell and i need to refactor the gameplay a lot so and on memory action so they all get six they all get six that makes no sense so is this a project 64 bug with the random function so the beauty of the random function so so so so so fuck it so i did it the wrong way around that's the issue god damn it i'm gonna be somewhere so they seem free day they're gonna be far away it will work out don't worry hey there we go so do you see me right now where's my water i have no water i'm sorry i'm gonna die so that's why i thank you very much right i gotta look at her new model too oh yes that's how i wanted it that is very nice that's a nice message in the bottle what do you mean curvature scale doesn't follow my coding guidelines i'm trying to have consistent coding guidelines so we're removing a lot of that kind of stuff and i low polygonized a little bit hello i looked at the new bottle it looks pretty nice hey also can i have my phone back you can have your phone back okay chad i'm going back upstairs now again i'm adding detail what you mean actually i removed one vertex we don't need the bottom part because it can't come out of the floor you're painting cheese nice there's a very nice message in the bottle honestly we can just put this in the level itself 94 vertices wait she made the texture 33 by 32 zena what is this texture format and the paper too mass cook i don't know if that's what it is it's and goes on better regardless you make the textures 33 by 32 it'll fix it all right just send me the fixed textures so i gotta say these do seem to be a little too high what the hell all right next up randomize the positions a little bit uh-huh fine seagull random range will be b param for multiplied by 100.5 plus 250 actually we'll just be powerful by 100.5 fuck it it's good enough it's pronounced case like the word maze or casa like doesn't matter are you doing why do you need to know are you trying to hack into my accounts why do you need to know personal information about me who are you hi the dir is i'm not even in america i think it's going to be moving across the sky too they will we're working on that part still so what the fuck is that button still we're going to have a direction start here let me just think about where no no i don't like that not intentional timer either no not opacity not nm states fuck do now you know do you i don't know how to pronounce my name can you make this rainbow ring slightly higher poli yeah yeah there's probably going to be a texture in the end um these are just there from biobank now i'm just going to rework it anyway do it's a nice new texture for me do you see the brown language circles that go left and right that made r and python look like shit no i'm in german english i can speak a little bit of latin a little bit of plato i can say bonjour no you guys seen the cat that goes bonjour no i love that cat do do do do do do learn french weewee my insights 1 billion nested loop iterations what are the circles supposed to represent how long one iteration is what is this supposed to mean i mean r and python look like shit how r is this this is such a meaningless metric you know what this feels like this feels like when a pharma company brings out a new medicine and they like test on 10 million people and like the results are completely random but then they find like oh out of every girl between the age of 12 and 14 that lives in arkansas and has a dog as a pet this medicine actually improved their back pain it's like of course you're gonna find one group where it's gonna do better fucking duh that looks very similar to that do reportedly 99 of lottery winners have profited from playing the lottery dark theme i am on dark theme oh you mean on twitter i don't know how to do that on twitter are machine learning shit or what no they're just a random thing you do in programming i guess we need to start a goal position somewhere that needs to be the next location so we need a function for that so so i need to back this up somewhere oh this is not good i guess i need to move my thing to 1f that works you're saying you should add bouncing balls to the raw mech beyond the charisma that true we can't be behind chris murrell's shadow we have to add bouncing bolts oh no my 50 layers of nested for loops in python is lower than nc yeah no i can't make 50 nested for loops i can't believe it man my performance is ruined my program relied on that so you need to say this and this doesn't provide anything they're all trend is pretty much the same as other benchmarks i see i mean it makes sense right you would expect python to be slower i wouldn't expect it to be 140 times slower though in fact i am a hundred percent certain i could make a test case scenario on the n64 in which python outperforms c i could do that to make a rate speed video python is faster than assembly on the nintendo 64 and there's always other some languages are now i can make it faster i promise jenny how do you put in a wrong language that looks like absolutely gobbledygook and is it possible to recommend you know musically going or something this looks like gobbledygook to you bro that's not a thing of the language that's you you should have been here like in 2015 when i was programming everything in assembly then i wouldn't have blamed you for that right now because you're fully integrated no jitting that's all right yeah yeah can make anything well would be basically equivalent code how's it fast and how do you even run an n64 okay this is the thing on n64 the only performance benchmark that matters for code that runs on a cpu is memory throughput so if you write your python code in a way where reading it takes less data throughput than reading assembly instructions it will be faster and this is possible because python is like more dense information wise than C code or assembly code the arrow just means lead road read word that's it or load word that's all this is just load word which i guess that's assembly brain to think about it like that but that's all it does really you no no i'm saying i can make an actual test where python performs better i know what you're saying and i agree with your python like in almost every reasonable use case python is going to be a lot slower i'm just saying i can make it faster if i really want to make what one test case for python is faster i could do that hello excellent gamer so oh i see so i could make sense no so that should work right and then so so so wait so that should work right i fucked up something completely i got this yes shit objects might be moving too far okay then seagulls have too much range these are the level boundaries no they are not these are the level boundaries how are the seagulls moving out of this ah yeah this is just a temporary skybox how are you reading that you do need to be able to see into the matrix really there is no other option so funny i haven't gotten around to actually making the skybox yet there were there was another level where i haven't gotten around to making the skybox and i finished the entire level and the test skybox just stayed there forever i'm not sure on your furniture when you sit on it or something oh okay it's someone else no this is not getting into the nso library bye psycho see you after the meeting it's still going out of bounds um okay test this give them no horizontal range at all still going out of bounds i mean the crash screen right there is easy to read because there is just like an assert there that tells you hey this is the bug i think the only logical conclusion here is that seagulls are not perfectly following the path only this red seems useful that's not true if you look at this look how much useful info there is there's the pc there's the ra okay gp is not useful um there's stuff like this and a0 you see 8027b0bd now you know the ram address of something i was doing something with the main code segment d0 is something de see this is an append display list comment so i know this was somewhere in appending a display list the stack pointer i know this is on the graphic thread sa is this number i know this is the master display list hat you know there's a lot of useful stuff here well it seems to not be following its path it's the problem all right if i just take that computer now and move i'm sure they'll no longer be crashing i'm 100% certain i'm just doing this for test purposes here yeah it looks like they are just reaching their end and then going for a bow so something near oh okay well i definitely forgot this line of code here so i don't think that would have caused a crash but that's definitely something that needs to be in there also i'm not warping them i just realized this is a problem they need to be warped when they reach or we just turn them around let's just turn them around let's just do it let's continue with different project 64 it's just letters and numbers your entire sentence is just letters and numbers duh i can do it back to you what now oh my god that would certainly do it they weren't moving from their position on the x-axis they were moving from their position on the y-axis so they were just they were not respecting their x position no wonder it was shit okay that's a problem the birds are going crazy so assembly is more like the latin of programming i mean that's a good way of looking at it so okay actually no i don't understand this now why are they not going to the correct location but who is pna how do you recompile so fast it's only a small change is the initial programming and semi-stellar programming yeah i think i think that's very fitting and then maybe like python is like not quite english but it's like baby noises you know they can say mama they can say nom nom nom when they're hungry and they can say when they're sad it's python it's not very efficient communication but it gets the job done you can do the essentials with just that it depends on where you make the change i guess you have to set up your includes correctly and like if you included this file somewhere else then you would have to recompile that entire file and that would make it take a lot longer well let's see how this does this gets plus the direction so let's think about this reach o health which is past the last point does that make sense no actually because when you're on the second when you're on point one then your goal is point zero so if you were ever on point zero oh but that's actually fine like this second opacity it's zero you are going the wrong direction but it's not opacity let's say right here yeah when opacity is one and then action is minus one then opacity becomes zero here and the goal becomes minus one which is an issue actually should it be like this for the orc he also work world. Okay that's better. Hey! We got the seagulls working. The base implementation of them anyway. Now, why is their vertical range not as it should be? Are we overwriting their Y position goals now? You see how they're all at the same height? I don't like that. They shouldn't be at the same height. I guess they're not quite- ah, they are basically at the same height. You can just use them, there's nothing you need to do for an undercut. They will literally just work. You just need to make them part of the area I suppose. Maybe that's what you're missing. Oh, oh, oh! We forgot to do the random float around zero. I say we, that means all of us. You guys forgot it with me. No one stopped me from doing this. You're bad, it's okay, I forgive you. Okay that's a lot better. And I agree, some sine wave movement on top of this would be nice. Make them white with a tinge of white? Oh I see. Maybe, but there's a good chance that we'll make them harder to see or different or whatever. You get the idea man, just why not doing it right now. Does this look good? I use floats more to get used to. Bro they're flapping, they are flapping. Okay, definitely not what I wanted though. Wow, what the fuck did I say that's so confusing? I thought I was being pretty clear. Yeah, I like it. No, you're missing the whole github thing if you use... Oh you mean the comparison, I don't know man. I've never used cloud resumer, sounds awful. I don't want to deal with Microsoft. All right and now adding seagulls to the second area should be as easy as just take the spline and move it here. Are they having a spline bath? Yes! Some random variation. Microsoft teams, who is Michael? You don't want to know. Oh we can make the seagulls go behind these, that's gonna look cool. That whole company is a little shady. Are you willing to go up to micro 64 version? I am willing to sell my own mother. For a good price. Like, at least 400 microseconds. Become Bill Gates and being a billionaire, true. I should name my firstborn Trill. Yeah, seagulls typically fly pretty low in case they stink. My toes are not stinky. I am barefoot all day, so they get lots of air. It's not stinky at all. See, okay, crash screen, easy fix. We just go to 802.85.84, generate seagull goal. So now we know where the issue is. I forgot to set up with the second spline path here. How is that not useful, huh? Skill issue if you can't read the scratch screen. See, see, see how good the crash screen is? We fixed it in 0.5 seconds. Where are my seagulls? We fixed the crash, but where are my seagulls? Why is it Area 1? Oh, I know where my seagulls are. They are in Area 1. I have to reparent that one. Now there are strawberries on Peach's birthday cake in Mario Party 1. On Mario Party 1 is canon to Mario 64, I hope. You're talking about the crash screen you set for a string that didn't exist in the file you were searching, so I still don't understand your point. Because I went too far and downed the memory and then I changed the 5 to a 4 and then it existed. I mean, I was able to fix it based off that, so shouldn't that be proof that I know exactly how to use my crash screen? Oh, that guy is in front of them. Oh, they're so close. Why are they so close? Guys! You're not welcome here. They might have no z-test? No, that can't be. Hmm. I mean, that guy looked fine. Seems to be some bug remaining with this whole thing. Hmm. Fuck. Okay, this actually makes no sense to me. I don't see how this is even possible. We just go from the first to the last point here. I thought we fixed exactly that and made this work in the generic use case. So, do I have to go from pure C to C++? No. It is easy to the point that I didn't know a single little bit of C++ when I started working there and no one said anything. No one even noticed that I can't program C++. They asked this during the job interview, can you program C++? And I said no, I've never done it. They asked this during the job interview, can you program C++? And I said no, I've never done it. And they were like, okay, well, whatever. It does look to be only one direction. Modern hardware and N64. Modern hardware has programmable shaders? That's a very big difference, I think. Do you have to read? No, it's basically the same. Like, everything you see here could basically also be the valid C++ code. Hmm, wait, they even both have six points, so how can this be? Hey, I think we made a decent weapon. Even without shaders, we did the best we could. Okay, well, this is not supposed to have a shadow, let's look at it earlier. Did you just come flying through here like it's natural? Did I miss something when I made this mine, maybe? Oh, I see, Graham, that makes sense. Modern hardware and N64, that is a big difference. See, at Minecraft, I'd use VS. I'm unsubbing right now. You say society sucks and yet you live in it? Curious. The Bravens are not seagulls, I am fine with that. We're not caring about that right now. Hmm, we can do something here. Let's do some debug printing here. I don't actually need this one. Let's see what the seagulls are doing here. We thought they were bats. Fine, I guess we will make them white and blue. Everyone seems to fucking hate these guys for no reason. Well, I guess they do have a reason. But if everyone hates them, surely there's something wrong, right? I forgot to square this. Hello, Polaris. Direction minus one, opacity six. Let's get one from the other side. Direction minus one, opacity five. How is that possible? How is that possible? Interesting thing to notice now, main issue is them taking the path from here to here instead of going around the path that is them. Path that is designated for them. They wouldn't be going close if they followed their path. How can this work in one world, but not the other? Actually, it's a very good question. I moved them to spline point O opacity plus O seagull direction. And that works in the overworld here, but not in the other one. And they have the same number of spline points, which is interesting. So what could even be different? In the first overworld, they move on the X axis, actually. In the second, they should be moving on the Z axis, and they do. 34,124, this should just crash, but it doesn't. Also interesting. They moved to a location where they should not be allowed to be, but it didn't crash. That means they must have not reached the last position, right? Is there anyone else? There's 15 overworlds, 16, 17, 200, 2000. If you haven't already, try to write your own heap allocator. I have my own allocator, and it's not a heap allocator. A heap allocator is way too expensive for something like this, where you already know how many finite resources you need beforehand. It would be a complete waste of space. Hello, I like DBZ. So they must have reached here, and then turned around to go over there, right? That is kinda what we saw. So, the last point is not being reached. Is this the last point? It is 0.6. Why are they not reaching 0.6 is the question then. Instead of 0.6, they're going to 0.0. The direction is supposed to just turn around. Equipped with this new knowledge, let's take another look. Delti said you should eat a lemon. Thank you, Delti. Lemons are very tasty. I accidentally went clean. Marty world again. This is the site level Marty is working on. It looks pretty awesome. All that just for one star is going to be crazy. Let me catch a seagull coming from here. It works now. Stas! What could have happened? Could it be that, because this point was defined to be more than minus 32.000, it overflowed and generated a point with trajectory N as the ID somehow? I don't see how. Some kind of data overflow is the only idea I have, but I don't see how that's possible, so I don't think that makes sense. Well, it's cool that it works. Cool. Next, a message in a bottle. Do views exist in RTYI? I am not sure. This is a very cool message in a bottle. They were going to 0.5 and the other 0.6, and both times they were going to points that should have been on the same side, but they weren't. Yeah? Oh, wait, you're right! The Z coordinate just overflowed to a negative value. Duh, obviously that would happen. Yep, that mystery is solved. Wait, I need the 2D pictures to animate. Oh, it's not going to work. Pan and A button challenge on RTYI? I don't think it's going to happen. It doesn't feel official enough, I'm pretty sure. He doesn't seem like the type of guy that is just up for arbitrary challenges. And not being an official game kind of makes it arbitrary in his eyes, I would imagine. Got it in ABC Strat in Star Road? I mean, I guess, like, as a hobby. But that's not the same. I think you misunderstand Panet's character. I don't know. Put a sparkle twinkle photographic on a bottle? Yes! It is very important that the player sees this, because Course 5 and the Ice Cap is locked behind it. So we cannot risk the player not figuring out about this. Zero big The Cat cameos, I'm sorry! Yeah, no, that's the biggest issue with the game. The alpha sorting is weird, what the fuck is that? Is that blender attempting to alpha sort, somehow? This is a weird shader setup. Why do people get so mad when I call N64 materials shaders? I mean, we all know they're technically fixed function pipelines, but like... You want me to say fixed function pipeline setup every single time instead of shader? Oh wow, I really like this fixed function pipeline setup. I'm raw. I cannot attach a sparkle bubble to the bottle itself, but I can... Or I'm planning to put a sparkle effect right here on top of the bottle itself. It just is not going to be attached to it. That's rage bait, he's rage baiting. I'm not sure if it's just a really complicated fixed function anyway, it's just that it happens to take a number of runs off if you're not nice. Well, I mean, I guess. Maybe, but like, I think the program is like the opposite of a fixed function. Thick to thin flare with the scroll, so it's thin in the bottle and then gets thick with the scroll outside it. Don't we already kind of have that here? With this part? I guess we can... Um... Something like that? You think that looks better? I don't know. Adjust the thickness. I'm not sure how... Like so? I don't know. Like so? I don't know. Oh, I thought you said thick to thin as in, you know, have some parts be thick and others be thin. Yeah, I can see how the thickness makes it more readable. Especially on the N64, it's like fucked up the resolution. Yeah, I think this is best. This is best. I... I don't know. Big yellow, red, orange, green, red. So, red is your... Behinds? Good luck. Good luck. Okay, um, this could be a little better. So... Also, I don't like the range. Honestly, I think I'm making a noob media for this. What font is it? What do you mean what font is it? Let's use the font we use in the game, brah. I should ask this owl what font he actually used here. What font? No, that's awful. If you have random ideas like that, PolishPython, why don't you make your own ROMEC? Okay, yeah, this looks great. To whoever is after me booty, you shall never find it. Only I memorized the riddle to recapture it. Plant yourself on a stone circle and greet your blue, red, and green friend. Show red your behind, then backflip seven times. Good luck. You think that's obvious enough? Stone circle, you greet your three friends. Three, four, five, six, seven. And I groundbound. Well, took more like eight times. And stand. That's true, ROMEC can get me hurt. I'm sure we can make this text better. I like that friend and sand rhymes. Okay, I don't know. Maybe... Still, I also want to make it so that if you have the star... Then it's not going to just happen. Okay. Leveled PSS. So if you have the star, then something will be set. So that the sparkles don't spawn. This way, the bottle stops trying to get your attention as soon as you have finished everything in the level. Let's see. Is that the last pet? Forgot about that. I added a new debugging tool, basically. When an object would have an invalid floor during render, the game just crashes and notifies me. That's how I get rid of all the invalid floors during render. I guess that's an issue in the game in some places. Gives me two CPU cycles. But it also makes shadows look consistent. Maybe it's a little more complicated than that. Maybe my debugging tool doesn't actually cover the side levels. Because that actually makes sense. It's kind of terrible. I didn't actually try to make it good. Not my debugging tool, my star tool here. Let me check that. Yeah, okay. That would do it. So where the fuck are the stars actually stored? Wait, what? Oh. Oh, they are stored here. Okay, that makes sense. Okay. I see. I am just going to assume it works. I'm fairly sure it works. I think this is obvious enough so that every player will find it. I'm not 100% certain. But that's what we have beta testing for. If I find during testing that the hint is not obvious enough for people, we can still reword it to make it more obvious. Anyway, we have almost two hours of stream now. And I will see you guys in the next stream then. Bye bye!
