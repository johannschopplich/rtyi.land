Hello, hello. I guess we'll do this. I don't like that. That's kind of nice. We'll do this. Who pinched me? Hello, X things. Nice, open the level. Blender. Hello, Selton. Hello, Selton. They're not light sources, they're just lights. Or decals. I basically finished this level here off-screen. Thank you, Pfizer. But I have to admit, a lot of this is also Diablox work and not just my own. Hello, Clayman. Hello, Clayman. I finished this off-stream. Yeah, what's that? Hello, ZeroVolt. Fun fact, ZeroVolt converted this song here and put it in-game. I think it crashes if I leave. Yeah, that's fine. I need to fix that. Looks so cool, yeah. Meowdy, partner. The shy guys be angry in the next mission. They're always angry, they're already attacking you. I'm gonna go for a chance, but I'm gonna keep this close to the chest. I do have a getup account, and you can find all the versions of this engine on there without the RTY part. And you can find multiplayer. But this right now is not open source yet. It will be open source though, once it's done. Anyway, I have to program the door today. This one here. And then some other stuff in this area. Oh, there was another new feature I wanted to add. I forgot. Mario, let's make the water surface... Yes, the WaveRace 64 water physics are not difficult to implement. Actually, I'm not sure I understand the full extent of the WaveRace water physics. But from what I've seen, the visuals of it at least are pretty simple. Hello, Biobak. Any OST wishes for today? Calling the Atari Jaguar a 64-bit engine is like calling two bicycles a... Fuck, what do you call it? A cart? CB-Row? Oh, that's a good one. CB-Row was such a cool game. Didn't finish it. Forgot why I didn't finish it. Found you on LinkedIn? What the fuck? You discovered me through LinkedIn? That is crazy. What are you talking about, Zayna? Why are you in such a bad mood? I've never played Clean Sweep, no. I have a presentation in university? Ugh. The WaveZen wave is just not like sine waves to me, on a desolated hexagon. The WaveZen wave is just not like sine waves to me, on a desolated hexagon. Do I run on a computer? I don't. Implementing the WaveEquironay be doable. Okay. The WaveEquironay. The WaveEquironay. Hello Samuel. Hello Michel, I planned for the intro but it's a PowerPoint animation. Shit. Can you just record it and send it to me? You have a son. He can be a mighty pain in the ass but you love him. This is like basically everything. Do you save a list of music done or left to be done slash imported? Um, kind of. I have this file and then I have the music folder here. And everything that's not in the done folder still needs to be done, I think. And then improvable songs. Oh yeah, the Moribos Tree Underground definitely needs to be done. I don't think I use this one here. I don't know what this is. I don't use the DPC anymore. Let's not have the power required to record and play a PowerPoint at the same time. PowerPoint is such a fucking joke, dude. God, we don't hate Microsoft enough.  Differently, because this kind of sucks. I don't know what this is. This should do it. A question, what program do you use to code? This is VS Code. Is this the right history? No longer we can keep an ASMR, you should. Are you having it? Someone who? I knew someone when I was younger that did Scrummeroid Romics and he put all his files in the folder named MPT Porn. Because his girlfriend hated his interests in video games. Oh, for sure, yeah. That makes sense, I believe that. I'm sorry, I'm Chris. I'm not sure if I want to spend time or stay for tuna shake. Well, it's up to you. What does a peer comment do? It marks the function as a function that does not modify memory. There we go. Safelex are now implemented. It's... It took obvious 2 minutes and 46 seconds to open. Holy shit. Found any optimizations? We did not find any optimizations... Super recently, I think. Except really minor ones. But, I am going to, maybe after this stream, turn all the 4x4 matrices finally into 4x3 matrices. Finally gonna bite into that problem. And that will be a pretty big optimization, considering how far into optimizing we are. This should probably be like a cutscene, right? I think we got an unstable stream. Oh. Hello? I don't know. I have no idea about what's impressive and what's not, to be honest. Because I was never an oil programmer, I feel. I can only compare what other people have done and what they haven't, I guess. Where's the cutscene? I don't know if you see, maybe you should set switch statements. Switch statements are just a more convenient way to type a bunch of else ifs. And smarters may say something like, oh but switch keys just can optimize into jump tables. Yeah, guess what? If else statements can too. If they can't, then it's a compiler skill issue. I don't know if you see, maybe you should set switch statements to a bunch of else ifs. I don't know if you see, maybe you should set switch statements to a bunch of else ifs. Do you know bugs that are in this video game? Nope, I don't know which. Let's take a look at some of the behaviors. The tick comment is a custom behavior comment that replaces loops in the mar64 behavior. In the mar64 behavior, every function, every tick has to load the behavior script beginLoop, callNate with endLoop, which can randomly get you between one and two cache lines of data, cache throughput. So that's like a random, what is it, 0.2 microseconds on data cache throughput. Plus all the functions you have to run in the behavior script processor. So it's probably like two microseconds per actor. With 100 actors, that's like 200 microseconds you just throw away. Alright, let's see what we got. VLC media player, please. Chillin', we're chillin'. Someone's at the door. Yo, it's Parakarry. Hmm, dear Mario, dinosaur land is in danger. Let me tell you how it happened. Ooh, okay, that's a fuckin' sick effect. It's a beautiful day on Yoshi's Island. Rian blessed us with a big gift. Unfortunately, it was a trap. All Yoshi's on the island were captured at the same time. While all Yoshi's were busy working somewhere. So I had to fly away with all my friends. Where's this gun? I can't do anything. So Mario, please help us. Oh, that's fuckin' sick. Oh, oh, that's good. I like this. We're gonna do that. That's fuckin' sick, I'm convinced. That's a banger. Cinema. Damn. Speedkid, speedkid. Yeah, dude, this, like, dude, Mario is fuckin' locked into it. He does not waste a millisecond. Can we make these into hand-drawn storybook-like pages? We can. But do we want to, is the question. It would fit really well with the idea of it being, like, Yoshi's story. Imagine, okay, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold this back up. So imagine this is a 3D scene. And this is still 3D, still 3D, still 3D. And then right here, it turns into, like, a storybook. Except the text is, like, normal Mario 64 text. This is normal Mario 64 text. This is normal, normal, normal, normal. This is still all normal. Well, no, this is still, like, storybook. Storybook, storybook, storybook. And then here, it's storybook. But then the storybook alpha overlay disappears slowly to reveal the island below it in 3D. And now with the island being in 3D, the camera pans over to Mario. Let me write that down. Interesting. We used Biobak's storyboard, the Yoshi memory flashback installed in storybook 2D Arch. And then on the island image, storybook first. But it fades out to reveal the 3D island. Camera pans to Mario. All 3D gameplay starts. Oh yeah, I'm sure Badub can pull that up. The thing that I got when you screenshake and you see the boat get eaten. Yeah, I'm not 100% sure how we implement the boat getting eaten and that yet. Yeah, that could work, though. Are we gonna be laggy as fuck? Oh, you think the one frame a second storybook cutscene is gonna be laggy?  The storybook visuals are not gonna be that much data. They're gonna be... It is only 320x240, right? We can calculate this. 320x240, maybe we have like 7 pages. It's this many bytes. Divide by 1, 2, 3, 4, divide by 1, 2, 3, 4. Ugh, that's half a megabyte. We might have to stream this from memory and then delete it, otherwise it might not fit in with the... Actually, this might just be a different level overall, right? Also keep in mind it's gonna be compressed, so I don't know what the compression factor is. Like 5.1 megabytes, I think. Kinda irrelevant. Okay, this song is driving me fucking insane. It's been going for 12 minutes. We're playing Chibi-Robo again. I don't think it's gonna put us over the limit, though. There's... I mean, if you look at this, if you look at this, if you look at this... Let's see, how much space do we have left? We have around 4 megabytes left. And there's still a lot I can remove, so I think we realistically have 5 megabytes left. Or maybe even more. There's probably a lot of silence at the end of songs, so maybe like 7 megabytes. If Redz does the compression thing, then we get like another 4 megabytes. I think there's a lot of opportunities here. To alternate? Well, if we make the images CI8, where each 64x32 tile only has 256 colors, which we can do for sure, I think, we can easily alternate those. And then that's halving the image for sure. Like, easily. The one thing I'm worried about is memory, but I think we're fine. Like, as in RAM, but now RAM is not an issue. Fuck it. It's gonna be fine. It will be so fucking cool. Okay. Okay. Let's see if this works out. Okay. Maybe not what I wanted. No.  I'd like to involve a moon. What the fuck have I done? No, Arlon, you slowly rescue the Yoshis as you go along. Who is pinching me? Oh, it's Biobak. Oh, you uploaded it to Discord. Oops. What is the first thing in the beginning of Missing Link that looks so different than Arcana? Well, it's Wilted for one. Right, because the Deku Tree is no longer there to protect it. But also you have to think about game worlds not actually being one-to-one physical representations of the places you visit. Right? If they were, then Hyrule would, like, there would be 20 people living in Hyrule. Obviously that is not the case. Or, like, the Kokiri Forest would be basically right next to Hyrule Castle. You need to think about games more as, like, a story that you're being told, and you're being told the simplified version of the story. They're not gonna give you every unnecessary detail. Yeah, Arlon, you start with one Yoshi being on the island, and then after you beat the first Bowser level, there's, I think, 11 Yoshis on the island. And then as you go further into the island, you find, like, a couple more. They're, like, all over the place. We even had a plan to progress the music as it goes along, but I'm not sure if that's still gonna be possible. Um, can we maybe give Mario the animation of the Star Unlock? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, that would be the ideal Arlon. Sure. Wait, you have my Twitter login. You can just do it yourself. Uh, where's your account? Did you make this here? Fireback3D. There we go. I can follow you back, I think. How do you retweet something? How do you retweet something? There's also someone who has to login to my Facebook account. One day, someone who's just sharing accounts with me is, like, gonna do some bad stuff, and I'm gonna get into trouble. I already know. Maybe just as a prank. Oh god, nevermind. Nevermind. I don't wanna put any bad thoughts into anyone's mind. Right, so Act Automatical needs... M action state set to the animation. Let's see how this works out. Okay, that's pretty good. Nice. We need to spawn the star, too. Okay, we lost that flower. That is indeed an issue. And I'm not 100% sure how to solve that. I know how to solve that. Okay. It's only Moiris in the center. I have a better solution. This is gonna look a lot better, I think. Thanks for watching! Love it. We need an unlock star too. Yeah, so this would just usually spawn that, we obviously don't have that anymore. This is weird dude, what the hell, that's how they programmed it. You know what, Parker, this is gone. Your gone too. Act entering star door, not sure what kind of door this is. What the hell. Could we maybe make these unlock stars in a way where like, the more stars you have, the more pop up? Or the more stars you need, the more pop up? I feel like that would be pretty cool. What if they were like, circling around Mowry when going up? You know what, the destination is so nice. Why did you think there was no destination much? I don't want to shadow on this one. Oh, the thing is in, I just fell. I guess not bad. The levels through the ages, what? Through the ages has a similar level, which is also a temple, but it looks very different. I don't like that this is a thing. Let's make Beeper and Drew decide how many stars pop up. So the more stars pop up, the smaller we want each individual star to be, I think. So let's do 1.5 minus Beeper multiplied by 0.055 maybe. Maybe we scale by a security of F. So at 20 stars, it would be invisible. Cool, cool, cool. That's not what we want. 20 stars is half size, makes sense. 40 stars invisible. Don't like it either. At 100 stars invisible, maybe that works. At 20 stars, it would be pretty big still. Eh, should be fine. Maybe this should be smooth stepped, honestly. Let's get smooth stepped. Let's get smooth stepped. This is what we do. So we're gonna have this, and then we're gonna make it so that in the future, if you have to unlock 20 stars, what it's gonna do? It's gonna spawn 20 stars with like two frames of a difference, and they're all gonna circle around you like that. Is this a song request? I'm assuming it is. Final bells on metal cover? Alright. Alright. Oh. Aha, load group 12, is that what it is? Nice! Okay, I like that. Perfect, I thought I had. Banger song. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Don't be backlash to me uploading the video. But it seems people generally like the video. Which is good. I wasn't sure if people would like me sharing game design things. I don't want to watch a video about Rayquaza. Any OST wishes? Anything get backlash? Because it's not my usual content. Sharing stuff about game design is very difficult, and it's not as objective. Yeah. The agenda is everything... you know what? That's a better one. Let's do that. It's funny. Wait, it got banned? What are you talking about? Oh wait! It got the video taken down. Oh, I forgot. Nope, we can't listen to this. I think I remember. Nope, we need something else. I guess Mario Sunshine. Dene, dene, dene, dene, dene, dene, dene, dene, dene, dene, dene. In case you didn't know, that's all we're gonna do. It's just dead forever. Alright, we should have a decent first visual for this now. Ugh, the camera here. We're gonna apply this water all around the island still. Okay, the star is completely wrong. Cool, cool, cool. Love it. How did that happen? Looks sick. Dude, let me show you the sickest thing ever. This is a level we finished just recently. You know what? As a bonus, I'm gonna show it to you on a real Nintendo 64. I finished this level literally earlier today. Don't tell me my fucking recording setup is wrong. My recording setup is broken. I guess I can show it to you like this. Now I'm gone though. You'll just have to deal with me not being here for a second. Look at this beautiful level. And it's perfect for it. Perfect there. The whole thing is so clean. You know what? Fuck it, we're gonna get widescreen. Can I do this without the DS crashing? Yeah, we get widescreen on the N64. What about it? Let's turn anti-aliasing on too, just to have the most expensive visuals possible on the N64. How do you like that? Oops, that was my capture card. I have so much input lag. No, I can't kill the Shy Guy. You guys have to give me credit, man. It's difficult to play with this. Why is he shitting cotton? Wasn't it just dust? Test this when you're ready. I'm definitely looking for a test as always though. I actually need to test the first level soon. Come on, get up there! I can't play with this input lag. Mario, please! We can't even kick. You know what? This is good. Playing with this much input lag, I bet that's how a complete noob feels about playing this game. And I've actually performed a test at this level. This has two huge areas, so we can just hide one area later on. Just press Alt-True. Why is it laggy? Because I'm playing with the highest graphics settings possible. And even that, it's not really laggy, is it? It's still 30 FPS here. And I didn't even optimize it yet. There's a whole second area that is rendering at the same time over that direction. Dead. Yeah, now you can see it. Right here. Banger. It looks slow-mo. What? Maybe it's because you're so used to me playing this in 60 FPS that... I don't know. It definitely doesn't feel slow-mo. I'm not the anti-aliasing that tried to stream. It's just the capture card that tries to stream sometimes. Or the video sometimes. Okay, that looks very mistimed still. Let me think about this a bit closer. It's too far out. It appears too early. And it doesn't stick around for long enough. And of course it doesn't spin. Looks slithero to you. Alright. Whatever you say. And... does this make sense? 0x64 by 0x80 is... fuck. I don't know. Zero zero seems like a lot. Let's do that But you don't only see if you're an excellent item and then look for some Sure, there's nothing really stopping you from just putting two games on one cartridge Oh Okay, that looks almost good Thanks But probably start out a little further away and like smaller but other than that It's just Respawn it's annoying swimming over here How do we do the skill You Needs to also be animated so we want to start with a small scale and slowly ramp it up I actually think maybe we don't want actually It's still pretty bad Think the item time might be wrong or too high Maybe it's an issue that it's like so low or so high up I Didn't see Mario that time I need to see Mario, please I Need a different scaling here You Maybe just square roots. It's a slightly more points You stream often yeah, I stream like once or twice a week and sometimes even three times Okay, then that was pretty close to good I would say I Need the stars to spawn a little bit of pixie dust I Mean the double sqr is what I want I Just like almost good, but I feel like at the end it needs a little bit of time where it just hangs You Like almost more than a second I would say I Oh My streams are always around 2 p.m. My local time. Okay, I think we've got it Now the dust You Yeah I think this is gonna look awesome though But pretty bad I Actually don't want this song to play here You Well, they are at 7 p.m. At the time where I was when I left the Germany Now they're 2 p.m. There's a 5-hour time difference I Think I'm gonna add a size range or size velocity to this because it looks pretty cool when you do that I'm also in real life to the one dog. My house could study and it's about seven stars Okay, that looks mostly good I If I want to and I think I will I I Want the dust to like fall to the floor Oh It's showering Mario and pixie dust Oh, that's so cool all stars should do this instead, right That looks so much better than a normal star animation Am I wrong I Mean try that I'm off to Canada and to flee Germany Germany sucks I Yeah, this instead needs to shower and pixie dust looks way cooler if it does Star Your compile issue one second Oh I'm kind of sad that you can't really see Mario here. And of course the star also needs to like explode particles So that parts not done yet, but let's check this out again Do I have a star that spawns like far away I guess I have to go my game But I don't want to play all the way to the convecting right now I can never go back to normal Mario 64 movement after this. Oh That's nice Yeah Yeah, you see how Mario good shower there that's so cool We're starting to have a game I Should find a name for that money shower, of course Refused to acknowledge The joke you just made wait. No. Ah, I opened the door and that means the door doesn't spawn anymore I forgot I already programmed that oops At least we know that works Oh Don't go the wrong way Super Mario 63 Yeah, that is kind of nice but not what we're looking for here, right I Can I have the opposite where it's that they like explode which that is kind of what we're making here You will see once it works, I hope So As I could use some dust cloud effects as well because it's super interesting going to the ground Perhaps with those clouds when it goes down, you know, you're not fair. I Will do that right now Buh buh buh buh, one second, let me just get the values here. 26.43 on the x-axis, that's the z-axis actually. This one here is minus 26.43, and then 549 on the x-axis, or 91. This way it's minus, and then just four fifths, no, 549, minus 549, and this needs to be the height, which we can also determine. Let's see if that looks any good. Double promotion? Where's double promotion? Is it not spawn object relative? No. Where is this double promotion? It's somewhere in here. Find floor? Yeah, let's find floor. Much better camera angle.  These spawned in the completely wrong spot. And I don't like the ending sound of that, it doesn't feel very satisfying. I also feel like they should just be spawned all across the door, sort of in these two places. We can't just make them brown, but we'll find door. Yeah, they should be all across. I think I'm just gonna have them spawn every tick on a random spot here. Okay, that's pretty nice. I changed the wall color, but stop before going down the rest of the way. I think this is good. I like it. We could maybe change the ending to spawn the dust over multiple frames, but I don't think it really makes a difference. Or we could double the size of the dust. Yep, I think I like the bigger dust better. It's pretty good to me now, honestly. Ground, roof or smoke when the door is fully open. I don't see how that would look good. It's probably somewhat bigger. Let me think about that. Hmm, yeah. We might have to just, you know, invest more into a bigger particle system, so we can do more things, really. I think we need, like, ribbons and stuff as well. We finally made something. Oh, that's good, quite. I wasn't sure if people would enjoy that style of content. That opened some more possibilities for me. We gotta move on, though. I'm gonna mark everything that's done with blasts. Let's see, is the cannon done? I already wrote a whole SFX composer, so we have a decent engine for sound composing now. Okay, the cannon is here, but it's not locked. So, what we want here is a guy that's like, I'll let you use my cannon, but I want 200 coins from you. Where do I put the guy? I want this to cost coins, like it's important to me that some things just cost money. I might have to give him a new platform. Or adjust this, maybe move this a bit to the mountain, because I don't like that this whole section exists anyway. Let's see how that would feel. Does this make sense? Kinda, it looks kind of nice. I think I want that. I think I want it from Super Mario Night 64, but unless I'm branching from Nicolas, I don't give them a trike on an eyepatch. I don't understand, unfortunately. I'm guessing Super Mario Nightmare was not what the idea was. Why is the Koopa style using King Bob-omb animations? What the hell? A klepto pirate bird. There's a pirate invasion, so them having a klepto with them would be fairly reasonable, and I think it would be cool thematically. Because pirates are known to have birds. So yeah, you guys will have to watch me remove two points now for a couple minutes. Sometimes I get stuck doing this, because I see a huge section where I forgot to remove those. Or I didn't have time to remove those yet. Yep. Oh, looks like we're done. How many are missing? 229. Still a ways to go. They should be the character that grants you the access to the cannon. Oh, why them? Why not a Bob-omb? Why do spells and defies seem to separate me? Don't like that at all. Actually, that's fine.  I think a black Bob-omb guarding the cannon would make sense, considering he charges you money. I managed to fix the microphone clicking glitch, because I'm not hearing anymore. I do not remember ever running into a microphone clicking glitch. You caught me a stinky. What if he just was patrolling up and down here, and then when you talk to him, it's like 200 coins and I'll let you in on my cannon. Hydranas are probably gonna find a way to clip into this somehow. Yeah, you have to broke them. The cop being corrupted something true. That makes me sound too much like blue hairsome pronouns. I will not be true for that one. You mentioned you're having problems with that back then. I don't remember that. I mean, I never listen to my own audio, so I wouldn't know if that happened. I don't think we need this behavior here. We don't use these guys. So I'm gonna call him Corrupt Dom.

Might have to farm a few coins real quick. Alright, we might be done programming this guy. Okay, it's already fucked up. Oh, so that's where my bracket went. Okay, now it all makes sense. I deleted the wrong line of code. Why did no one tell me? Okay, okay. That did not work at all. Let's try that again. Is it just not responding? Is it setting the action wrong? It shouldn't be setting the action wrong. What the fuck? Do all questions not work right now? There's a good chance this is true. Because I did refactor this recently. So, I might have just broken this. I changed a lot about dialogues. Yeah, look at this. It's just always zero. Damn. Okay, we need to fix dialogues first. But I think the problem is done programming. It's just that I broke dialogues in the entire game. That's annoying. Well, that's a little bit of an annoying issue to fix on stream. So, I'm going to fix this off stream. Hopefully, I might be able to stream tomorrow. But I'm not 100% sure. We would have to do more overworld programming. We're slowly getting done with part 1, which is great. We're also going to have to do the sand form soon. The sand form is going to be very fun. So, yeah. Until next stream. Bye bye.
