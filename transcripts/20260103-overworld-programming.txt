you you Hello x-lings Hello Zeta Zebra Happy New Year. Nothing changed. Hello Dodongo Nope, sorry, I got a ping. Maybe this is important. It's my agency You And then we're going to lose too much on YouTube YouTube isn't that bad oh Oh my god, my agency just let me know I need to finish a video in 10 in 9 days Great. Awesome. Thank you. I'm not being able to do that That's fucking stupid They wanted it that soon. They should have let me know earlier Hello tired You You watching this on YouTube right now I can see Okay, let's see, how do we have this working out? After you talk Go section three, which is a cutscene. Oh Of The one melon that survives which is this one here and shy guys approaching it. So I think the first thing we need to do is Program the shy guy spawner Hello Jordan Oh my god, why am I getting news like that right now right as I start streaming Okay, what about this basically I have this Mario game where it's like a first-person thing Mm-hmm second We have to struck Mario game and Basically in that game you you trade like drugs like it stalks you you shoot people you try to get a high score and I was thinking when I release it we could release it with a contest Where the person that gets the highest score it's like a cash reward. I guess think that would be exciting Also, look what I made off stream with Zena This area here The way this is going to work is that there's going to be ice caps and while you're outside the lamps you're gonna take damage Unless you're wearing the ice cap I Think this is a very chill area. You see the moon over there, too It Looks very good, but something about this is still cringe to me. I think it's like how these assets aren't really buried in snow like it's just stylus off It needs to be properly buried Lemon did a test of course 12 recently. Oh That's bad, that's not round anyway, that's not me we're working on we're working on this You Need to while we need an OST We need to signify to the shy guy spawner that the invasion has started which we can by just setting the action You You Are you Actually, we don't need this You good I am good Hello Karen Maiden You But an ominous silence true true hello sky left happy new year When is my play on Android I think this will be playable on Android Anyway if anyone has OST wishes I am willing to listen You Hey, we already have the spear guy overworld set up Okay, wait, we have basically everything already We just need to make the spear guys run around Got it You Hello savory How long do you think it will be on the underside of this finish nothing? I'm gonna just the engine rework stuff. I'm actually pretty close to that from the things I want to do The major thing missing though right now is the music engine which I basically finished it from my side, but There isn't plan to maybe remake the whole thing in our own words to be more optimal altogether, I Might only release an engine version of it as before and though I don't see why it wouldn't run on Android surely they have good enough emulators, right? You Do meet her no, okay New demo of a separate be version releases, but you probably won't care about 50k triangles whenever that's like you love me that X's and Mesa's crazy stuff, though Doesn't sound that crazy to me That way They still I mean a high triangle count is a bad thing There was a resolution when I got mad and you made work I Understand your proposal and I think there are some merits to it, but I don't think it's very different from what I was already doing right I think it would lose a bit of resolution which would make this look crunchier But going around the rim that way To have like the one strip could prevent some of the staircase stepping so that maybe is a good idea But I'm still not sure I even want a 3d coin anymore and not I want a PBR coin anymore I definitely still want a 3d coin so You Now, how do we define how about we just define this with two spline points, I think that's the best way of doing it I'm hearing people brag about high triangle counts just reminds me of the early days of Mario 64 modding Where people would make areas with way too high triangle counts and they were like extremely unoptimized and they were very proud of them and It is Giving me a little bit of a feeling of cringe The ship was already done last stream I Don't have stuff people make in high poly is just very inefficient I remember bro Dude sending me a level of like 20,000 triangles and around 15,000 of those was just him putting trees in the ground in a way where like fuck the geometry This was for Goomba's easter egg signed in like 2013, so don't get mad at him for that Uh-huh. Oh I didn't shout them to this. That's why There's but if you had a dedicated texture artist Do you think you'd use more 60 by 60 a force like the venture games as much as images sourced from other games as fast at all. I Don't think I would use more CI force because CI force generally Cannot be multi textured with another texture Or maybe I would use them a little more because if you have an artist for it Then they would be able to maybe use CI for tech just get multi texture with themselves in a reasonable way But most of the time I would still use I force or I ate You They are not child traffickers That's like asking if the if like an orphanage it picks up a child starving on its steps as a child trafficker I Mustn't be firm feel brought I paint in the way pension The benji games piece stuff together in a cool way, but because of the filters there seems There shouldn't be seams. They're doing it wrong if there seems So you're not able to support each chunk having a unique palette Well, if each tank has a unique power than there seems unless you match the colors on the edges, but that's very difficult So raising a kid going the kids growing. Well Seems to be no issues with the kit. She is still healthy This is a banger So even then the big seems between each time you spend some of the eggs I think But you don't need to make seems just because you use multiple textures Much texture mode in fast 64 just cuts half a pixel and then merge it into a single texture Half a pixel and then merges them over each other so that the filtering looks the same That's the correct of doing it. I mean you can see this even in Mario 64. They had this figured out on Mario 64 Getting it wrong would be a little bit embarrassing So it's doing well, I think you can guess I'm actually not sure. I think this is just a generic overuse injury Or maybe it's from sleeping wrong Since you could probably use a very basic or large texture mode system is just I mean not having any seems if the radio bees I Said it was 64 large touch. Well, you don't need large texture mode of 30 by 64 and this you're using rgba 32 Captain I have no idea what it is. I I don't go to doctors anymore Every time I go to a doctor they just make me wait for hours and then tell me random bullshit that is wrong they just roll a dice and Then I listen to them and it gets worse You The last time I was a doctor it was for my elbow here and the doctor told me after waiting for three hours the doctor told me well nothing we can do we can inject like steroids in there and then maybe it gets better and I actually just take painkillers until the next three weeks and then come back and that was such a bullshit advice I actually just googled symptoms myself During my own conclusions and then did physiotherapy which fixed it now granted There is a chance that time would have fixed it even without therapy But it took less than three weeks and I didn't take painkillers So I didn't listen to him and it fixed itself faster than the doctor told me it would be fixed So Do you have a mouse or do you have a drawing tablet? Nope. I have a mouse I need to explain Well, okay. I think you misunderstand large texture mode if you have 464 by 64 You have 256 pixels of resolutions, but there's three edges between it. So you actually need a 253 image You Hello zeal distant lens Although I now have a house doctor and I am willing to give doctors one more chance So if my wrist doesn't get better, which it is getting better, then I will go to the doctor I Think you can play RT by I on retroarch on androids You Right My engine doesn't like this now still gotta get used to that Same here. Oh my god years of conditioning And rested fuck you will go into this device but not to restraining what the fuck are you talking about I Don't even know what restraining is I do workouts. That's all I can do. I tell me what restraining is is This restraining if I pull weight like this because I do that The nyan-nyan training I do that was like, I think a hundred fifteen pounds right now. I could just pull it down Since you know Charles and stuff don't the flowers and reuse it similar technique Well, it is the same as large texture modes would do except I manually split it because large texture mode kind of doesn't slightly wrong I Wrote it the meow meows. I did do the meow meows. Do you see my shirt today? I have to meow meow shirt My daughter when she sees me wear this shirt, she points and it goes meow meow meow As I feel oh my god mom I'm on TV I Do you think use supplements for your workouts? Mmm But a roll of nylon tape with handles on either side clip onto a cylinder that holds weight plates I Have no idea what the fuck that is. I can't even visualize this. I Guess I don't know what nylon is. How did you learn coding? I was just born with it Running so easy I Mean it came across from Yeah, I didn't learn coding it is the truth I just didn't learn coding I just started coding and it just worked Illegally, you can't just do it. I Don't think anyone has to learn coding Just look at what other code how other code works and then just start doing it I Music days kick ass. It's the doom OST Happy New Year's. Let's go with 2026. We're closer to 2050 than 2000 that is true factual You know what this could also be it's good to be like this It's a learning don't I mean I guess you can consider learning this what's what's a similar activity I can't compare to anything I've cutting just hate and song the best is that I'm Devin mines. Yeah, but fortunately that's only like coding is a very front-loaded in frustration Activity but like when you start you all have to deal with stupid tech bullshit and compilers and dependencies But then after that you're free and you can just do what you want Are you working on today the melon mission? You You And your answers will be done in the first second half of the year What kind of question is that you're assuming it's just gonna get done this year I'm not telling you shit It's done when it's done Still have to wait for a lot of biobank reworks You Right, I forgot this is how it works double promotion Right, this is the function I use now, how did that even compile that's not a real function So That's actually a basic reason pretty specific on many amount of edges But each generated in the base area by one pixel that filling work correctly exactly unless you use no filtering At least I think that's also implemented in first 64 actually in fast 64 It's slightly wrong because the outer edge also is one extra cut that they just add So you just have to deal with that That's why I cut them manually and they don't want to change how that works, unfortunately Look it's done when it's done. You can't ask me for release dates. It might release it might not release I Accidentally gave that the melon 3d model They're also not spawning anything y'all notice that You Oh Why are we not spawning anything You Happy New Year case in chat. Happy New Year my back Look it up What do you think about the 600 otherwise I have no idea what even that console is which games are in the console And a Wink at man, it's been a while It's called a wrist roller and tomato plate hitch with high capacity separate. Okay. Wait, let me Google that in a second Yeah, they just refused to spawn I'll never mind now I just want wrist roller How I see So it is this yeah, I already heavily trained this done by doing triceps push down Okay, they do spawn we just need On Actually one because we want to allow walk off actually yes I Mean anything you have to what you're just announcing that bio back. How do you know that? How many zombies on screen can the n64 handle it's probably in the quintillions it's probably more than the quintillions It's it's probably larger than any number you've ever heard You That's actually a good question, what will I stream after RTY I has done I actually don't know It's mostly rest of the cold often I Mean when I go outside, is that what you mean? Now you're right retros is kind of dogshit I hate it too So There was something I wanted to do we now know they spawn They run down they don't jump over the gap, but that should be fine Unless that's what I wanted them to do jump over again. I Wanted to make sure they die correctly You will bring down the heaven's wrath And they are no longer your people to save It's this the issue that I wanted to fix here I Just try it Swarm us So I said do the extra sprint on the image that just to make that I've checked out of all It's the only reason I think to do that. I think that's why they do it. Yes Hello Chunko You know one thing I still really really want to do and this would be perfect after RTY I is just Spend a month on making one romhack Just give it a month and then you're forced to be done. I Think that could be banger You Hey stem true Case does the s hyper pretty on Texas export correctly to our device as well then change that which takes a little clamping Yes, hi Take a look I believe that exports correctly. Yes, but I think if you want to see that correctly you need to be in fast 64 render on modes I'll buy a bank. I'm gonna show this to you since you're here. I was working on this We're staying off stream this area here cozy village What do you think? This is far outside the eyes the idea here is this is a village and everyone here is scared of the big Raven that took over the castle I Think it looks very cool One thing I really like is the additive combiner here for the light. Well, it's not a combined. It's a blend modes. That's very good to me Okay You guys like this or not, that's good. I thought this area was a bit cringe To be honest Mainly it's cringe because all the things we put here don't look like they belong in the environment like What the fuck is this? It's just a table someone dropped in I Think it should feel a little more abandoned. Yeah, I Tried to do it with the fog and stuff it needs to be more snowed in right Like this house, I think this house kind of has what I want, but they need to be like icicles hanging from it So The idea for this area was gameplay wise there would be You would take damage everywhere here unless you're in the lamps and in the lamps you can grab up an ice Cap, then you can use the ice cap to be immune from the cold Snowed in towel you might say Yes, is there a pun here you said that like that's a pun, but no, that's just what it is He's a bit much I'm being inclusion or should well, it's because we didn't run it's got it. Yeah Snowed in town from undertale Wow Aaron puts on a Viking power up. Yep. Maybe it doesn't do that All right, I was fruit It can't stop No, he doesn't do that because we don't want a new power up to just exist for one level like that So what I saw this coming from here is it is interesting getting some Austrian verdicts cuz I have some Juno's to come up I have to get your notes to There is a moon in the sky It's like it's still about the capital. Yeah, that's some purpose I like that, too Oh, okay. Why do you have a much more powerful geo not than I did then Anyway, let's figure out why these guys aren't moving on Oh because I Didn't set the action to one fucking Yeah My life has gotten so busy, that's the wrong level. Did you guys see how the game closed with the skirt transition? Isn't that cool? Maybe it's no bizarre effects, but make the damage outside arms more justified. Yeah, definitely I need to think about more how to make that happen. I was thinking Mario would also turn a little blue and decolored You Yeah, it looks like the goal position isn't correctly determined You missed it again, okay a circle There's like four random ones that can play when you reset And just all the way there emulator bug Let's get animation from our facing the left because anything else is going to look goofy I can make that There's like an ice block in that level. I can make it so that if you go to 0 HP there Mario just kind of freezes What if he just freezes in place whatever animation frame he had and just drops That would look so cool. He just freezes and boom. That's it and then zooms in on his face and goes. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I Will make a note for that And Freeze to death animation for outside and on freezes You can't play sounds after you close that anymore you can only edit run directly Well, I guess you can put the sound and run directly but Because he's blue see we still have to make the decal Mario model I had a plan where I just copy Mario's model. This is something I would do near the end of development Obviously I copy Mario's model and everything is going to be in the decal layer And it's like an environment map thing and then we can put in any vertex alphas or vertex colors we want So that effects like Mario being oily or Mario being dirty or Mario being wet or Mario being ice cold can be pulled off Mario already has a gun in this game. And in fact, I'm releasing a game where Mario has a gun in the next two weeks But I tell me why if M extra time I equals one isn't working on my wall side function. I am allowed to tell you That should just work, I mean, I guess I don't know what you're trying to make work Did you say I'm gonna shotgun ruskies for users? No, it's a completely separate thing. This is a thing I made like 2020 and I can finally release it Anyway, hmm. Why are we not? Updating our positions the way we are expecting I Because the first entry is something else Like this now they should go to the watermelon The first entry is something else Like this now they should go to the watermelon We're doing this again we're going to the wrong level over and over Yes and I want to release it with a contest where the highest scoring person gets like 250 bucks Like I want to invite everyone to play the game and then whoever gets the highest points gets a little bit of money from me it needs to be like a verified run though Okay that looks good The idea with the shiga and the watermelon basically there's this field of watermelons here when you first get to this area and eventually all the watermelons disappear except for one and this yoshi says help and it's because the watermelons are and the shigas are eating his watermelon Oh they're falling out there that's what's crashing the game makes sense Next they need to jump when they get to the gap here and then slow down a good bit Do you think it's because I'm running the function as a regular voyage rather than action? No I mean if you're not returning a value then you're just gonna get a random value and you might just get an infinite loop and crash Okay It's not impressive it's kind of a shitpost game but I have made it and it's time to release it The game is free but you can win money by getting the highest score once I release that I was thinking a $250 cash prize see I'm scared of putting it up the $500 cash price because I have a $500 cash price and I give it to Canadian I have to file a tax form and I don't want to do that I've been living in Canada since 2021 I thought this people knew this at this point So Hello SunnyDive what's your name? SunnyDive3F This means my stream times yeah it's in the afternoon now well my stream time actually didn't change when I moved from Germany I wanted to get the same audience so I moved them from 7 p.m to 2 p.m. Is there any other competition? No That has even weirder tax rules I bet I actually can't do that because this is going to constantly be lower than at the beginning so we need to do something else it's 200 units For hundreds Take a random identity I got and I'm Iris I know you're Iris Farina I can tell from the profile picture Why are you making spoofed is the defiance that I've heard you don't know you see good Um why would I make this an F32? Why would you make a thing that never changes a variable? Um what did I do wrong? I forgot this I'll beat you okay there's a mask around it Move mask on ground Now they should be jumping the gap I also want to make it so that if they've jumped the gap they get slower and I think the only way to do that is by giving it like an old subjection and then if the sub action is active Something like this So feathery shields that mess with object memories they better work Let's F32 spoof this okay I'm not asking what that would look like I'm asking why you would do that Yeah Okay this is an issue Was Canada a business opportunity or you just like the place? It's because Zayna lived here The dancing like ballerina is true Oh wait the I'm also just glad to live anywhere that's not Germany Okay that seems to work they keep their speed until here They just don't have enough speed to jump the gap I guess I just haven't seen fancy similar variables like this so there's a lot of sense to define Okay I will tell you something if you have if I instead of like const float spoof this like this it would generate this during the function call and if I did something like It's going to load this from ram the 5.f it's going to load this from ram add it together and then just multiply it and that's going to discard it so doing it this way actually compiles to the exact same as doing it this way so there's really no difference here because it loads this from memory anyway but if it didn't load this from memory and had to generate it from memory because it loads this from memory anyway but if it didn't load this from memory and had to generate this during code then it would just be worse so really when you're doing that you are guaranteed to either end up with the same or worse code than if you just used to define this is luna's project 64 made by aglab in that case what we'll do is if our subtraction is set and you land then it sets it to two uh jump a little good and blending slowed down i'm just that would be cool i'm surprised it doesn't just work out of the gate anyway okay nice they're attacking the melon and okay it works it works it works the only problem is they're speeding up here again so that's obviously a problem oh this resets the osap action let's see that's fine we can just cheat like that and then the squared oh this needs to be more than that because it's squared i'm surprised the other one worked at all that's crazy i'm gonna make it easier if the platform edges met the water rather than plateauing the platform edges met the water instead of plateauing yes that would be easier but i don't want that so oh cool they don't like being killed right now oh shit i forgot about this part they're crashing in the other level too right now that's a crazy mistake to make rock is fixed but they actually need their hitbox active too so okay we got a watermelon defense going he's already attacking it okay this is not easy actually what the fuck this is so hard wow okay we need to make it easier that's cool though it's fun i like it so this should probably get harder over time right what do you think should this get harder over time i would say yes what we'll do is the hundreds the random minus by 16 so now each second they spawn two frames faster which means after a minute they spawn instantly but they're not supposed to spawn forever right so um maybe i should increase the devisor a little but it's a music doom one minute what about one minute so yep that's what i just did so plants versus zombies true god plants versus zombies is so goated really long i think you should kill the shy guys and time it and see how long it takes before you get bored okay i mean i mean i made it so you have to kill 20 shy guys that was the original idea so let's see how that works out in practice with the num shy guys killed what do you always think to have small counties play whenever it gets difficult to know there's my next one and there's going to be a cutscene at the start of this and then like it's just going to start so you're gonna arrive to something kind of like this so oh it doesn't reset their interaction so you can also make them go a little bit faster here over time but honestly i think their speed is fine just making sure that they actually only spawns 20 now three of them are missing two of them are missing try diving into them i'll be running because let's see let's jump on every single one that's fine i don't want the yoshi to just tell you that because you might just dash into the spear and that will damage you also i just realized the bug this needs to be always active there is my phone no yeah but people should be able to just have that choice i think it's fine the melon is not going to explode right away i think the model is going to have like five or six hp the melon is definitely going to have particle effects for that or not particle effects but an effect now i need to prevent them from running off as well i think we can just move this in a little bit i think i should just do the thing they find fun i'm sure they'll figure it out so let's play cutscene not melon exploding kill mario respawn next to yoshi is what i'm doing here it's not getting more efficient than diving here do i wonder it can be how many lines of code have you written uh maybe two or three million you can have yoshi freaking out standing on top of the melon where he faced the ones the players can't find that could kind of work yeah and i like that but let's do this first here let's see how would the melon shake it would i think would go up and down and maybe go down um let's actually multiply by this so we have exactly eight repeats let's see how the damage animation looks like now scan z and down on x y yep yep something like that you'll see i think you'll like what i just made i hope i made it correctly oh peak it's peak it's peak fUcK fUcK What the hell? What is going on here? It's scale looked way too big. It's because I multiplied by 30. That's why. I've made a romhack of Pokemon Reds, like last week, where Global EXP Share is active and Global EXP Gain is reduced and I've been playing it and oh my god it is so much more fun. I will never play a Pokemon game without Modern EXP Share again. Okay! Now it just needs to die. It's maybe a lot of fast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I kind of turn it down pretty easily. That's not an issue at all. Yes, I can make particles spawn. Probably something very similar to my test particles here, right? Let's do that. Fuck it. Let's do that. Let's do that. Let's do that. So, I probably want this to be like green particles that turn darker. That should be quicker. This fuck-ass tool. I never want to see it again. Probably starts like here. Oh, I see. Okay. And then a little bit darker, maybe a little orange or two. Like it's kind of rotting. Yeah. Sure, we're just going to straight up import the Doom OSD, whatever you say. I think the size should be slightly increased. And then this one despawns faster than the other one. That's fine. I think a little less drag would be appropriate. And a little more lifetime, maybe not. A little more random translation though. This is a big one. Let's see how this works out. And, you know what? I have the perfect sound. What? Where's the money bag? The money bag death sound is so good for this. Okay. This one, maybe. Hello, Alec. That sounds pretty exciting, Marty. I'm very excited for your level to be fully in-game. It jiggled more radically the more it got hit. Yeah, it would be nice to have a damage indicator. What if it kept jiggling after it was hit? That's what I was thinking. That looks pretty fucking sick. Let's add a cutscene where it just explodes. Okay. Yep, they just want to ruin the Yoshi's day. What is the lore behind the gruesome attack? It's the Shy Guys, man. They hate the Yoshis. First time meow. Meow, meow. That's true, you have to cut the melon before eating it. Yeah. He is speaking facts. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't imagine it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even realize it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even imagine it was still growing. Wow, I didn't even imagine it was still growing. I can imagine difficulty too. Although I did run a Course 12 playtest just a couple days ago with one of Zena's friends who is not into ROM hacks and they beat Course 12 without any issues and they loved it. And they actually loved the camera too. They said the camera was great. So I'm not confident that it's going to be difficulty. As much as this, this is Return to Yoshi's Island. Oh, I didn't increment health. That won't do it. Well, the thing about AgloCam I think is that it's predictable. So if you don't mind having 12 buttons to control the camera, then it mostly works. But this one's also predictable. You just need to get used to it again. I think they're just used to something else. The game being too easy. Oh! If the game being too easy is a complaint people have, then we fucked up. Because ideally this game would be fun even when it is easy. But typically the problem with ROM hacks is that they're way too difficult. Okay. I see the issue. They should all just celebrate at the end. Let's make them all celebrate. Let's make them all celebrate. It's funny that you think the issue is that people are going to think it's too difficult when I was worried about people thinking it's going to be the other way around. Because every ROM hack ever is too difficult for the average person. Even Star Road is too difficult for the average person. And Star Road is one of the easiest hacks you can find. Star Road is okay, but it does have a lot of intent and difficulty. So you think the problem is not difficulty, but rather unintentional difficulty? I guess there is some truth to that. For sure. Star Road wouldn't be like Yo! 964 if someone actually took the time to try and make a decent version of it. It's just that when I made it, I made it up the Bindring version with the shitty Mario 64 engine. And I did it in like 2 or 3 days. Okay. The difficulty level is not what you intend it to be? You messed up. That's true. You think all of Star Road's difficulty is intended? I don't think so. I think these need to be bigger. Can you believe that this is only 16 bytes of data that I'm storing here? All this info is 16 bytes of data. It's fucking crazy, is it not? This is so cheap, but it looks so expensive. So there are several reasons, but there are a lot of difficulty jumps early on that could have been fixed very easily if they were not intended. Yeah. I don't think they are intended to be so difficult. Like the fact that the first Bowser level is such a difficulty spike is kind of very bad. Because you can't get around that as a player. That looks wrong. Yeah, there's no way that's intended, right, Biobank? With the enemy song? No. If there is an hours of playtesting, that's going to make me stop being so bad at the game. I remember one of my first few stars in Star Road was the one with the pillars in Brown Up and Pond. And I remember that being very difficult for me at the time. When the runes sparkle in September? I do not remember that. Honestly, do players really want difficulty, though? Do they not just want excitement? And can we not bring them excitement without difficulty? Oh, did you use channel points to request that song, Tanja? I do not see when people redeem channel points. If you have used channel points, you will need to let me know. And chat will need to watch for you. Okay, I guess you requested when the... Okay. Fine, we'll listen to it. The last impact shadow factory is very difficult, but it's all intended. Now, whether it's good that you intend something like that or not is a separate conversation, I guess. We need to reset now. Oh, I remember this, yes. Bet I kept requesting this. It is a banger. Do all Germans like Rammstein? No. Actually, I think Rammstein got cancelled recently. It should have challenge, because otherwise it wouldn't be exciting. Okay, but what if it was exciting without challenge? Like, hypothetically. Just imagine this. Yeah, Rammstein did some really stupid shit with the fans, if I remember correctly. I think there were some pretty serious allegations there, but I don't know how credible they are, but I know they're there. You know when it's exciting without challenge, keys being jingled? I mean, theoretically, if we could design the game in a way where without difficulty you experience the wonder through the eyes of a baby of keys being jingled, I think we win. Wouldn't be good to be honest to think this game every time this happens, true. Hello, Armach. So many people coming in today being like, I didn't know you streamed. What's going on? You can't agree with that anymore? Which, the first or the second part? Because Mario Galaxy is fun without challenge. Where's the challenge in Mario Galaxy? I think we are more difficult than Base Mario 64. Well, okay. I think our game looks more difficult than Base Mario 64, but because the physics are actually polished, I think it's just more difficult. Like, a jump like this is not something you would do in Base Mario 64, right? Like, that feels kinda dangerous, does it not? But it is safer. I guess people could do something like this. I don't know. We have a lot of playtesting. If it's too easy, I'm sure playtesters will tell us and we can just make it harder. Are these jumps not all more difficult than Base Mario 64 jumps? Something like this is some, like, Tick Tock Clock bullshit. This shit is easy? Well, obviously it's easy when I play, because I'm fucking GOATED. You can see me play Mario 64 and it's gonna be easy. It's kinda pointless. There's no counter to end the clock in Mario 64. Well, there's this course you love, but... I don't know. I'm feeling fairly confident that the game is either easy enough or too difficult. Or difficult enough or too difficult. When you play this level, is it easier compared to Base Mario 64? Which course are you comparing it to? Because if you look at Course 11 Mario 64, that's, like, Wet Dry World. There's nothing more difficult than Wet Dry World. Have you looked at Wet Dry World? Can we please be sane and compare it to Wet Dry World for a second? Let me open Wet Dry World, just so we all have this in front of our eyes. Oh shit, I don't have the Star Stands up. Oh, I can just do that, okay. Okay, I want us to compare that to this, please. How are you ever going to lose in this level? Like, this shit is not serious, right? Like, you climb the entire level just doing that. Oh no, I took damage. Okay, I guess this part's difficult because of the fuck-ass camera, which means I can't actually look in front of me. Awesome. It's not losing, it's about difficult jumps. I think in that sense, you kind of make it difficult to yourself. The camera jumping onto this felt like- what the fuck? The camera automatically turned. I hate Mario 64. I hate Mario 64. With Mario CD on? Let's try that. Right, that's how the long jump works in this game. Oh yes! Mario CD on, you can actually see. I don't know. I don't see how difficult this is. I'm feeling fairly confident in this assessment. This is when only Wily Bay is easier than Shifting Sandman in Lethal Lava Land. Interesting. Honestly, we can just reset to Action 0 here. Let's see how this works out. This should now, when we lose, kill us and put us in front of the Yoshi thing. Basement is hotter than most of upstairs. Maybe? Hard to say. Oh, what the fuck? That's not where I was supposed to go. Actually, I guess Jolly Roger Bay you have to jump over the thing. There's the fuck ass plank you have to walk over to get to the ship. And then if you fall down, you're just stuck in pain. What happened just now? This stage is the hardest stage in the game because you're constantly fighting the urge to go play a final level. But honestly, the way we should consider this is like, if truly at some point it turns out that the game is too easy, it is very easy to increase the difficulty. It's always easier to make it more difficult than it is to make it less difficult, right? If that truly became an issue, I think we still shouldn't be worrying about that. Everyone says that. Guys, Mario 64, you pick your own difficulty. You can do difficult jumps if you want. Look at this. Let's go to the same level. Let me just show you the ways to approach this level. If you're like little Timmy Noob and you want to get up there, the way you can do this is you can be very careful. I'm a stupid little noob. I'm a noob. I don't know what I'm doing. I can't play Mario 64. Look at me. I'm walking. Look at me. I'm a little stupid noob. By the way, the movement I'm doing here, some of the testers had trouble with that. I think. Which is why I made some of the stuff here easier. But let's say you're not a stupid little noob. You can, like, do shit. I can't get up there, but I can get up here. Isn't that fucking sick? That's freedom, man. That's the point of Mario 64. This is where the soul of the game is. You can't just do things like that. Can I always add a difficulty slider? No, you can't. That's why it's grungy. Yeah, that makes sense. Be savory. I can see that being a decent strategy. Until you get too good at playing upside down. I just realized we do need Action 4 after all. Maybe we don't? Maybe we can just do that. Actually, no. It needs to be here. I should do it. I should do it. I should do it. The only difficult change I would do is increase damage for falling into lava. I think there's a weird societal phenomenon going on where people say they want difficulty and then they experience difficulty and they actually hate it. Like from suffering games? I don't think they're difficult games. I think they're just games that make you play the same boss fight over and over until you know all the patterns. They are trial and error style games. I'm gonna get some hate for that. Okay, what was wrong with the death warp though? Something about this one was really weird. Anyway, let's try again what we have right now. We want to feel like we're being challenged by feeling like they can't master it. Yeah, I guess Dark Souls gives you that. Or from such games. I think they're purposely designed in a way where everyone can beat them in finite time. Okay. It starts here, it goes up, and then it needs to go down. So that's C-0-0 now. Do you watch Forsen? No. I think I made the melon particles too big. The question remains, why does Mario take damage when that happens? Oh wait, the used object is not being set I think. I think that's the issue. I think I got it. So can I add, I think some people are being aggressive and pretending they enjoy doing the peer pressure instead of grabbing the object being smooth. Maybe. I think what it is, is people like the idea of liking difficult games. So they play a game that is difficult but will make them fail a couple times before they master it, but will always be beatable in finite time. Ah, still didn't work. My birthday, I'm 60, lol, awesome and pawesome. Okay, Hazel, thank you. Okay, it still needs to play the cutscene and the melon needs to respawn. And, this stupid, it needs to not stay gone forever. Same shit here I guess. Okay, so you're being skilled artist in other fields to the infinity, environment art, double design, what are my chances of getting confidence without prior knowledge? If you're capable of coding, you're capable of coding on the N64. It's not any more difficult than any other architecture. So I think your chances are pretty good. I think most people can pick up coding. The one thing difficult is when your little brother sees you drinking beer and he wants to taste it and when he gets older and tastes the beer he hates it because it's not like he imagined it. Interesting take. This music's kinda loud. Let's get some models. Okay, I'm not sure which models there were. I'm not sure I wanted those models converted for Rty either. What models were those? What's a difficult game I beat? What about the Orc Colosseum in Pokemon XD? You know, the really difficult, unfair one. That's something I would consider difficult. Because you don't learn anything from playing it. It's difficult from the get-go. Although it's also a lot of randomness so maybe that's not a good example. What about Mario 64? Oh, right. Is that Mario GSM 64? It is Mario GSM 64. Happy New Year, Mario GSM 64. Here's F-Zero GX. What about Mario Kart 64 100%ing it? Is that difficult? I think that's like moderately difficult. Becoming like top 10 in a competitive game, that's a difficult game. AI makeovers of screenshots from Rty? You know, people are going to hate you for making this. Okay, some of these look very wrong. This one's kind of neat. But I'm not allowed to enjoy AR unfortunately. I think it is kind of neat. I think the technology is neat but I'm not allowed to enjoy it or to encourage you to do that. People will hate you for making that. You're going to get like a shitstorm right now. Nevermind, maybe I'm wrong. Okay, I see. I like that. Okay, what else could be going on that makes it so that the player doesn't respawn where they should be? When I warp the player, they just kinda... Die? Is there... Do we do something with BRM2 other than that? That scale thing? Come to think of it though, this was supposed to be the smallest melon. Let's make this one. Make this one. Make the warp one and go to one. What did you just swallow? Water? Wait, the pill I took. This is rhodiola rosea extract. It is supposed to help mental neuroplasticity. Now, does it help or not? I am not sure. But imagine if it does help. I'm not willing to take the risk of it not helping. This is like a small version of Pascal's Major. Do not try it just because I told you that it maybe has small benefits. Because like, maybe it doesn't. And then you would get scammed and it would be my fault. I don't get it. It's putting me here. It shouldn't be. And the thing didn't respawn. Creatine. I know. Creatine is very important. So creatine is actually very well supported and you absolutely should be taking creatine. Everyone should be taking creatine. That one I'm confident in. I do a bunch of like small things that maybe help mental function because mental function is very important to me. This actually makes no sense to me. He's like, he's respawning somewhere around here and taking damage. And his skill is going all weird. Is this just not a legit deathwarp? Does it just not work as a deathwarp? What if I use something that's not a deathwarp? Like spin airborne warp? Vitamin D is also a must if you live in Northern Hemisphere. Vitamin D. I'm locked in. Come on, export a level. What the fuck? The melon also doesn't respawn. That's sus. Okay, actually that makes sense. Yes, the cutscene is actually already over by the time this plays. That's fine. So I actually do want to keep this a deathwarp. The question is, why is it just not doing anything? Is it because warps in the same area don't work fine? Did I break warps in the same area? I think I might have. Let's try another warp in the same area. Okay, that one works, but I think I had to program some exception for it. But why is it putting me in the position where the melon is? Wait a second. I think this is the issue. So my Mario Kart secret is counter steering? I don't think I've played that one. Dude, I wish they made a version of Mario Kart Double Dash where you could drive without the boost being the way it is. You know what I mean? When you play Mario Kart Double Dash and you have to do that? Always like this? I can't stand it. Why is like 90% of the game button mashing? Who thought of that, man? I'm so mad. I should make a remake of Mario Kart Double Dash where button mashing doesn't work anymore. Yes, that's the Smash Gamecube controller. Is it rare or something? Okay, the SS has a cooldown. Yeah, I think it's less extreme than Mario Kart DS, but I've seen some MKDasher videos. Hey, it works! And the watermelon respawns. Kind of. I'm using Action 4 after all. I think the mission is fully working now, except for the ending. Maybe the ending does work. Oh wait, there's no cutscene yet. Alright, let's try it. We're gonna start the mission, lose on purpose, talk to the Yoshi to start the mission again, win the mission, see if we get the star. Because it's less work, Caleb. Help! Shy Guys, they came and they destroyed my melons, what if they come back? And now the cutscene would play after Shy Guys coming back. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. I lost! It's too difficult, speaking of the game being too easy. Does it not work again? It doesn't work again, okay. No. Music? I don't know, that's some Russian words. I didn't count. Oh, fuck. It's way too difficult. It's way too difficult. What's an appropriate way to make this easier? I think they're slow enough. Maybe. Do they spawn too fast? It's like once you get hit once, you're just out of it for good. Demand more help? I don't know. I made them go further back now and gave them a bit more spawn time. Yeah, I was thinking of a visual for that too, but I have not come up with anything good yet. I think maybe their spear should deactivate as soon as they are getting hurt. I think that would help considerably. What the fuck? That was their spear, lingering around. That's a bug. That's considerably more manageable. I still lost. See, that's what I'm doing. More than 5 HP is way too much. I was curious if this will ever be released as a main playable on the original hardware. Yes, of course. That's the end goal. No, that wasn't me. Okay. This needs to deactivate immediately. Oh, right. And then this can't be at the bottom. That had to be at the top. Okay, I see. I really should have made a separate function just to destroy them. Anything will be done? Nope. This is the overworld though, and all 15 main courses are done. So really, we're closing in on the finish line, but there's still some polishing left to do. So I don't want to give a release date. Who knows, maybe I want to make this legally distinct. I'm definitely going to talk to a lawyer. And that's going to take a lot of time, if that's what we do. Oh, what the fuck was that? The interact stance also doesn't reset, which is a problem. And there was something lingering that hit me. And groups to splash damage. I think that would be a very good idea. I think it'd be more satisfying as well to just kill groups of them. Throwing a power-up so you can take out the enemies more easily? No. I like the group idea. I mean, they were already spawning somewhat in groups, and that's a very fun way of doing this. Yeah, no, I think there was a lingering hitbox around somewhere from something. I think they can somehow die without destroying the hitbox. I mean, this is definitely... yeah, that definitely caused that. I forgot to do this, even though I was 100% depending on doing this. So surrender and bounding reset run lingering items. Let's see how that happens. I mean, sure, but that would take more time than just removing the lingering items. It's more to spawn in groups, kind of. Okay. Let's see. If we do it this way, then there should be just a random chance for her to spawn more than one at a time. That should shorten the total time, and that should shorten the speed at which they spawn. Let's try that. Just one. It should happen around half the time. Two of them, okay. Another two of them. Another group of two. A group of four. Okay, that should be very rare. A group of 50,000?! What?! Okay, that should only happen half the time. And it should not happen more than once. The dungeon can easily spawn like 200 coins and the like. The Shy Guys don't have the real Shy Guys, I haven't unthought of that. I think it's because of Project64's wrong counter-factor emulation, basically. Because the RNG function I use uses some deep hardware behavior that Project64 might not be able to emulate. So Project64 just emulated the random function wrong and got the same result over and over. Damn. It's still too difficult, but I think we're kind of getting there. Is this unbeatable? It's beatable, it's just very difficult. What other dials could we turn to make this easier? We could move the melon to a location that's further away from the middle. Like we could move the melon over here. And then they would all come from more or less the same angle. But I kind of like that the melon is in the middle. It should be a noise or something to tell the player that they're close to hit the melon. Maybe. How many have you beat? I actually didn't count, but I think I was very close to all 20. I think those 5 were the last ones left. We could also increase the spoof distance maybe. Let's see if that helps. Let's see if they're still jumping over the gap now. Because now they should slow down way earlier and you should have a lot more time to react. I don't like that, nevermind, I changed my mind. Does that kick still give you invincibility? They never give you invincibility. They give you immunity to lava, that's it. quicksets. But that's collision, not interaction. If I just do it... It's time to jump on Samara, I can get to the other side faster. Yeah. I don't think that's really the issue. I think the issue is that diving into them is kind of awkward. You get hit once and then it's just over. What if after a Shy Guy has hit once, they are really slow? So that him hitting twice is very difficult. I think that's the solution. Let's try that. They are slower when you do not look at them, so you are not getting a surprise when you are on the other side of the arena. They are already very, very slow. A charged animation could also slow them down quite a bit. I don't want to program the ability for them to actually lose parts of their model like that. One. Two, three. Four, five. Six, seven. Eight, nine. How are those two? Ten. Eleven, twelve. Thirteen, fourteen. Fifteen, sixteen. Seventeen, eighteen. Nineteen, twenty. Give me the star. You asshole, you didn't give me the star. Six, seven. Or any other nine-year-olds. So I won that time. That's when they can still fall off, which is a problem. Hopefully that fixes that. Maybe it's easy enough now. Thank you for the Melon HP by adding a fence thingy to destroy first. No, I don't want the player to just have its melon being hit like 10-20 times. Like at that point, each individual hit doesn't feel like anything anymore. It's all one hitbox, Joss. We'll see. We can't do that. I don't understand it for life. I think what we have now is fine. We can always tune the difficulty by just reducing the speed. Uh, it would just be weird if it was reduced so much that it's like visible. Like, you know, it would look weird if they get too slow. But I think the speed we have now is like just barely touching the line of being acceptable. We can reduce the turning angle too. That'd be an easy knob to work on. To make it a little easier. But I think this is fine for now. The waterman has five hits. Anyway, that's it for today's stream. And I will see you guys tomorrow for the next stream, where we hopefully finish the mission and add another star to the star total in RTYI. Until then, bye bye!
