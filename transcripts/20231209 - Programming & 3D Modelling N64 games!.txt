Well, we're live on Twitch, nice, nice, nice. And we're live on YouTube. This looks like it is going to work. I see a message from Zeyna, your Twitch works again. This is my first time trying Restream. Also first, you are definitely first. I have a Restream dashboard that I might not need. I'm not sure. Hello James, hello Maui. Return of Twitch stream. We are Restreaming to both YouTube and Twitch at the same time right now. This is my first time doing it, so hopefully it works. Hello some guy. Why? Oh, there it is. Took a while to show up. Does it have more delay now? I hope not. That would kind of stink. Let's put on Mario Sunshine, why not?  Pablo Capo. Shit. It's been a while, I completely forgot. It says we have 24 viewers, that's cool. Yes, multistream biomech. Hello, Mario Nova. Hello Skyloft. Yeah, see, the reason I went back to Twitch is I found an ad blocker. And I not found an ad blocker, Twitch would be dead to me. Hello Lunar, hello some guy. I am not playing Fortnite. Hello, Tommasus. Yeah, if you have been a Twitch-only viewer, you missed a lot of stuff. Yeah, Twitch was dead to me because I didn't have an ad blocker. Hello BaselineFunk. It's too cold to take off my shirt. I mean, it's on Twitch, so I'll talk on YouTube chat, so my messages stand out more. Valid. What ad blocker are you using? I won't say. It's a tiny bit of unistream, but we're too shy to talk. You're shy? Dude, yeah, I'm so happy with the new redesign. You guys miss like all of course 10, course 9, course 11. That's how long I've been off Twitch. Let me show some of the stuff you missed. We now have 16 different floors, normal Mario 64 floor. Can you hear everything? Is the audio good? Yeah, we also have a pretty reasonably often crashing OBS. Grass, everyone knows grass, water, stone, creaky woods, snow, sand, ice, and now the new ones. This is mud, I think, wood, steel, glass, so now you can't see all chat message. They all appear on stream in the bottom left corner. Oh no, no, never. I was still streaming every Saturday. Okay, this is leaves, oh this is mud, I don't know what this is then, squishy, and grates. Do you link the sound effects and the textures here? I'm making it myself, so I thought I could explain this. Every surface has a type that is a bunch of different flags on what should be active on and currently we are working on oily boily bay. This is a pretty early area still. Something that Twitch viewers might have missed is the entire outside area here. This whole thing, and it's really, really cool. Look, you can even make floor steps in the sand. And he gets upset, and he gets upset. Game of the year 2024, I hope I can release it 2024, I don't actually know. The area is enormous, yep. It's giant. Like the new chat up in the corner, though I think it would be better if the comments didn't fade away after so long. You want them to stick around forever? This is the coolest effect ever. You can also ruin these guys' day. I love my thwomp domino, I do that in like every game ever. What else do we have? We have a bunch of stuff here. The UT1 has 10 seconds delay? Oh, hell nah. Hello, HedgehogGamer. Hello, WingCatMan, also a very long time ago that I last saw you.  You're missing YouTube streams? Oh. That's unfortunate. I usually schedule them an hour in advance, so it shouldn't be hard to catch them. Oh, I see, my own bad game, that is a long delay. This area, of course, not finished yet. We already have songs for all these areas from Badoop. And the songs are a banger. I think I like the dual setup. I think this works for me. So our current goal is to make the 8-bit section here. And we're almost out of retro games. So we're getting kinda desperate here. We're pulling from games that are barely even retro games. At the point of the N64. So the retro game here will be... Where is it? Board the Platforms! It'll be like Mario State from Board the Platforms in Smash 64, but in 3D. And it might be before GTA 6. Oh, that's a nice bio. Hello, ZeroWorld. Hello, ZeroWorld. And the next level will be Mario Paint. The level after that will be Dr. Mario. And then the last one will be Mario Land 1. So yeah, the idea for the Board the Platforms is gonna be like, you spawn here, and then you're gonna be going around. We do need to get the art style right first. So let me enter the level, show you what I have right now. We don't have Mario yet? Or Mario goes missing? No. Those games are just not good enough. You like my background? It's just my house. I didn't put it on purpose. Oh yeah, the Twitch chat doesn't know this, but we moved to a house recently. What is going on here? What the hell? So yeah, if you look at Board the Platforms in Smash 64. And it's this type of background. Which we could put, but it just doesn't look very good. I think. So we might have to think a little bit more about this. Although it's a very distinct style. I think we could make this work in 3D. Didn't you always live in a house? No no no, we only recently moved here. I should probably show you guys what our house looks like. I hope OBS doesn't crash. It did not. Okay. I have a scene for facecam. It worked. So we got that whole thing. That's a bunch of weightlifting setups. We have the Yoshi wall. And then there's another wall here. That's my setup. Dude, my controller keeps disconnecting. I'm hitting the R button. You live in a gym now? I've always lived in a gym. The Yoshi is so big he doesn't fit in the shelf. I didn't play the Mario RPG remake now. So. The question is, how do we best make this background work? I'm thinking we're gonna have a bunch of spheres. And they're all gonna be semi-transparent. This is gonna need so much performance. Actually no, let's not have this be spheres. We could just have this be squares. What if we take a dark blue sphere? This will be around the level. Around the sphere, there will be a bunch of rectangles like this. And they will be semi-transparent. Blocks in 3D instead of squares? I was thinking squares all facing the middle. Hello, Maths Cass. Dude, look at this. This is actually such a cheap trick. If you look at the actual background, it's just a single image. With a bunch of these drawn on. We can make a much more impressive effect than this. How are you? I am good. Hello. Alright, let's try it. You know what? It can be just a cube. What about the background being the targets? The targets will be actual things in the level. Look, I already made a target 3D model. Bonjour. Bonjour.   And the problem is obvious. How much will it affect performance? If we just do individual squares without the sphere thing, it will barely affect it. I think actually I need to make a sphere. Just so we can evenly distribute the squares around everything. It's a lot darker. Yeah, I like that. Let's actually move the arrow somewhere where it doesn't overlap another level. I wanna check it out real quick. I don't wanna follow them. I don't want to have them follow the camera. I want them to be fixed in the sky so that they look like they're actually there in space. If you look at this, you see how this square is actually there in 3D space. And then these here are not. These are just static and not moving. I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna have one layer of these squares here that are actually there in space. And then we're gonna have one layer of the slightly green ones here that are also there in space. And then we're gonna have one layer of the blue ones that are also there in space. So it's gonna look like this, but a lot better. It's gonna look like a high-quality version of this. That's the idea. Yeah, you have a foreground background and then an actual just background background. But we're gonna have it actually be three different backgrounds. Mind if I do something just for nostalgia? What is it? I'm not making a B3313 retro level. What the hell? Did you put in a song request or something? Because I don't see what you did. Shit. I guess that's one disadvantage. I can't see when someone actually uses their points. Alright. Well, I guess that's a song request. I'm skipping this one. They're not listening to Crazy Bus. You have been scammed. Are you a free horse on the way to the sweet, sweet nectar? Oh my god. How am I gonna do that? How can I make a cum shake down here? There has to be a stipulation that you can only get it while Zena is here. Because I can't just cancel my stream and make one. Just put a sound song, please. Send me a new one if you want a different one. Okay, so these are just gonna be a primitive color with nothing else. Does that kind of look like the Smash Bros. Square? Something about this doesn't feel right to me. Smash Bros. Square feels a lot whiter. I think this is just because of how fast 64 renders transparency. I have to look at this in-game and get it right for trial and error. Continue this video today. The game is really looking amazing. You guys are doing great work. Dude, the comments on this video are so insanely positive. And this video is doing super well. I think people are sending this to their friends and be like, holy shit, look at this N64 game. It looks square. No, what I need to see is how the transparency looks. Because fast 64 doesn't render transparency right. Right now it just looks like a dark blue square to me. But it needs to look white. Right, I need to compare it with this. And I think it's good. I also want to know why there's this bug here with my pipe. I don't know why there's a bug with my pipe. That is actually kind of terrifying. We might be running low on memory in this level. Let me check if we can do something. Reduce the memory footprint. 0f. That's Goombas and shit, isn't it? Let me use any of this. Use the purple switch. Let me scan Pablo. He didn't send me the new song. Yeah, that's what you want. You want the virality of your video being sent to other people. That's like the one thing you're hoping for. Eating an apple. Apples are pretty nice. Nice.         Let me also use Blender 2.79, why? 2.79, after that, there was a huge refactor that changed a lot of things. It removed a lot of features and it added a lot of different features. So if there was a feature that was removed in 2.7, 2.8, that you still want, I can't see why. For example, you can no longer use vertex alpha, at least not without separate layers. A lot of old modding tools are not compatible with 2.83, so that's probably why. Can I know what quiz I'm beta testing? Well, right now you're not beta testing anyway. I was saying that if Quiz 4 gets done, you may be able to beta test it. I'm not making any promises. All right, let's make the green squares. This should be smaller by a little bit. I actually give this variable names, is that not insane? Completely unexpected for me Hello kiddos, dude yes I have been off twitch for a while Let's see how it goes, first stream back to twitch Glad you came back as well I did not expect my first stream back to twitch to actually have a lot of viewers on twitch Well, I mean I'm also on youtube So half the viewers are on twitch, half of them are on youtube and I really like this This is a very nice cozy setup for me This also means I can make both youtube and twitch fight against each other, like the viewers, to get more engagement That's insane OMG a chat on screen, yep we're using the restream chat We gotta so that the youtube and the twitch We can sub again, yep that's free $2.50 in my pocket I think there were some people that never unsubbed from twitch Thank you for donating to me all these months, because you forgot Appreciate it I wanna take a look, see if it's all fine This feels like there should be more viewers to be honest You still have the gargoyle tag? Let's go I asked him the same thing, what thing? Why does it feel like it's been months since you did a stream? At least months since I caught one? Because I streamed on youtube, Mushy I have been streaming on youtube for a few months, and now I'm streaming to both youtube and twitch at the same time Twitch changed the TOS so that now you can multistream I've been streaming the whole time, Garryk Just no one knew, because I was streaming on youtube On youtube I used to average around 50 viewers On twitch we used to average around 100 viewers Right now combined we are at 104, isn't that nice? Oh this looks so good! This looks just like it This is what we want That's so cool I don't know why I only see 145 pound, okay kill us, okay okay Let me show you, let me show you what's going on here That's my bench right? The big plate, that's a 50 The small plates, that's 25s And then there's an 11 I have the most fucked up plates ever So what's on there is 242 pounds, plus the bar And I did 80s, it's more and smaller honestly More and smaller I think, I don't need to be ashamed for 245 plus the bar I think some squares rotate, no they don't move in smash Yep, the chat commented both sources Yeah the plates are all over the place, they are pretty wack Okay next we need a light green square that's almost blue Oh there's also a factor of these all being different shapes in the original Oh so they're pretty well Man has a 13 pound, 27.8 pound and I do have 1.1 pound plates Why did he even get a 50 pound plate Yep My bar also has a permanent bend now They have 100 pound plates? Nah We do need new 50s though I think it's 270 pounds, no that's 242 pounds on there And then the bar too But the bar is not that heavy, it's not a 45 pound bar I just did that for 9, 8 and then 7 reps The bend bar sucks for bench It's not too big a deal I think Do you think it makes bench easier the same or harder? For me honestly it's not so bad because it rotates the bar into the right position so it doesn't move as much Squares and yeah these are all supposed to be rotated towards the middle so that's kind of an issue but I might still just rotate them afterwards I'm just trying to efficiently make this whole thing somehow It's not gonna look perfect along the way It just takes the shoulders right out, what the fuck? Quasi billboarding? No these are not individual objects We might just rotate them back in like in blender But first I need to have them like be positioned around this whole thing so that I can have the level work Right we also need to create the level is the thing Hello Anubis Could you get a way of painting all the squares onto a scrolling texture and paint it on a few layers of squares so you only need one for the sphere of geometry which would move the No no no no if you do that you are getting four times overdraw One time overdrawing the entire screen is like 20 milliseconds Five milliseconds so all four together is like 20 milliseconds So that would suck Yeah of course shoulders, muscles, wrist bar Honestly for me it's not as much about building big muscles it's just about building strength at this point I just like the challenge of like increasing the weight You should build big bugs I would love to build big bugs I am literally working on that Did I start working at Gears for Breakfast before or after I left Twitch? I don't even know Either way I work at Gears for Breakfast now Before, shit you know that and I don't Hello Sully, I'm on Twitch and YouTube I will read both chats and they're both combined Yeah I think it was before too, Lilo I do have a lifting belt but I only use it for that lift because I don't want to break my fucking back And I have two rooms, one above the other joined by a climbable rope, would that work with object loading and shit? They would have to become the same room So while they might be perceivable as two different rooms they would effectively just be one Okay wait, wait, wait, wait Is this a lava bubble texture? That's a lava bubble, I think I think there's a lava bubble spawning inside the pipe Like the weirdest graphical errors I think that's what this is It's like a single triangle They're two big rooms, ah yeah you can't then And I like it, I would like to add more of these I mean I would like more of these This is Smash 64, bought the platforms So yeah kiddos, hello boys to men Damn Twitch is a lot more active than YouTube right now So next we should probably also make these squares be able to be different This was a new video being uploaded and you just have to pop in as I got the programmer wrong, thank you I want the same vibe as the original Smash Bros and it doesn't move there so that's why I don't want it to move here Okay this looks fucked up here but I think it might be fine in-game How hot can the RDP get? It's fine How many coins is left on this hack room? After this 4 This hack room Yes this is Smash 64 Check this co-op Can I do anything to any of them without rope or door Oh these, they are not big Now you can just connect them We can just make, ah Making this the same room This might be fine but we'll need two different boxes to define the room which I can work with But do we really want this? I feel like that would ruin gameplay Because this whole thing, you're gonna be here after doing some platforming and then just falling down here because you think this is somewhere to go Would ruin the experience I think it's a bad idea to do that, just like gameplay wise That's why I'm against it, not because of technical reasons I have some code that I used in the video here That is not supposed to actually be in the replay I'm making a new video on when bad code is actually good And that's gonna be part of the video So now with the bounce nets Wait, the door with the bounce nets? Am I missing something? Yeah, I think I need a different image here I was thinking you were talking about this part where you get the star How do you enter this room at the bottom then? Transparent pixels overlapping each other are not as bad as people make you believe Let's go! It's a Psy-Op by BigRamHacking to make you... What the hell? What was that? Why can't I move? Is it because of all these condition triangles? Either way, that looks terrible I hate this That looks so bad Maybe we need a different concept for how to make this I think this was not a good idea It looks like Melee's Break the Tarkin Corporate art style This guy, yeah Shit, it's the thing, do you hear the radiator too loud? I have a better idea You see this guy here? What if we take this? What if we make... We take a high poly skysphere and we cut it out from there Don't just say case! What do you mean case? Don't case me! Is it the furnace that's loud? Can you hear it? If so, then yes This furnace will turn on every now and then You don't need 3D... No, no, no, look I have THE idea The best one yet You have chat on screen now? Next level streams? Yep, because of Twitch and YouTube multistream Okay We will make a UV sphere We will give this 32 rings and 64 segments We're gonna make it 20.000 in size And this... Will be what we use We're just gonna draw the squares onto here That's not noose? What's not noose? You don't need so many polygons? Where's all your skyboxes? Lila, shut up and watch               Thank you Okay, are the white ones always square? Dude, awesome, I love these YouTube problems. The white ones are always squares. Do we copy that over or do we just make any one we want? So we're just gonna draw shapes onto this like this and then we're gonna invert our selection and remove everything else. Just watch, Trina, you will learn, today you will learn. Tetris exactly, we're drawing like Tetris. That's me, raywascool777, I changed my name to Green's Dash Productions recently, I just wanted to let you know I'm advanced. All right, Green's Dash Productions. T-spin double, yep. Yes, I have a confession, I was never a big Tetris fan, I barely have any time in Tetris. The only time I really played Tetris was when I was bored in class on my calculator. Let's in depth criticize a quick proof of concept. Eh, I don't like the length, I think you're nuts, Yoshi could give you a possibility for a tunnel level, we're not making a tunnel level, oh you guys don't even know what the next level themes are. We actually only have four level themes left, some of these are still pending. The next one is planned to be Wild West Valley, in Wild West Valley there will be a bunch of villains, a bunch of like boss enemies that you have to catch and these will be like boss fights, detective, that type of thing. The next one, I'm not 100% on this one but I was thinking maybe a music level but I have like no ideas for this. The next one an oversized casino level, I also have no ideas for this. And the last one would be a comic based world, Mario would be the comic superhero and he would have to fight the bad guys and like hunt them down like a comic hero in like a skyscraper city. So you know we're talking about the dimension where you will only hear blabbering about Mario 64 code. Wouldn't that be an awesome place to be? This song sounds like the guy making the song, I had fun making it. And we're gonna do this for free spheres. Can read anything, ah this is the Minecraft font, it was supposed to be very readable. What if musical 1 is actually a skill with multiple subjects where you have- oh god that sounds awful. You made Among Us shaped blocks, trying to think of how they would look like. What would this be? What would what be? Are peanuts yes or no? Peanuts are nice. Scallop said he's gonna release a demo soon so let's use- shit I forgot to fuse this. You know what I shouldn't fuse this, this should be separate stuff so I can decide the render order. A transparent one. Let me also look into the bubble code. Bubbles. It seems that these use some undefined vertices, oh well that was an easy bug to fix. A Yoshi school, that's cute, do we do a Yoshi school level? That's that's kind of a sick idea. You know what I was thinking? I was thinking I should go back to my old school that I went to as a teenager and just break into it, just like go there and feel the liminal space, you know what I mean? Just like be there and be like oh my god I'm not supposed to be here. That's a fun vibe. Oh yeah this looks awesome, this is really good looking, I like this. I feel like a Yoshi school instead of a music level, that has potential. Will it be on stream? Will I film myself breaking the law? Yes or no? It really seems I'm breaking your NDA and doing drugs. Dude, I had a nightmare today that I accidentally broke our NDA and Gus Fring came to me and interrogated me about me breaking my NDA, that was fucking scary. It was not your fault, Lila, no. Did you break your legs? No, he just interrogated me. Scary dude. You know you're the reason I want to make video games in the future, that's cool. If you like making games, you should. You can't even start making games like today, no one's stopping you. That's an ugly piece. There are only two hours left from today, that depends on where you live. And four hours is plenty. Dude, four hours, that's enough to start Mario 64 hacking and make Course 1 of Mario 64 Madness. If you think about it, that's what I did. Video based on a game I'm making for my final college project. Making games right now, that's neat. Oh, I see. Game design major. Oh. Bye, Zena. See ya. Bird. Yeah, that Madness remake is now in dev time for literally 50 times longer than the original Mario 64 Madness was. Just think about that, 50 times longer. Yeah. That's a little extreme. And update image on Discord. The way it currently is, makes no sense for a ship. Agree. The way I want to make it makes a lot more sense, prettier, cooler. Oh, I see. Can we have a door here? No, I see what you mean. But if we can add a door here before the entrance, that would work for me. Or, well, actually, since this is a hallway, we can do this. We could make it so that both rooms render while you're in the middle of the hallway. And then when you're downstairs, this room hides. And when you're upstairs, this room hides. This should work. 64 Land is your favorite? My favorite is also always the one I last released, which I think is 64 Land. I'm not remaking Last Impact. My last hack is only up to 64. Well, it wasn't a serious hack, though. That was clearly just cloud grab. Dude, do you think being honest about being a cloud chaser makes being a cloud chaser less bad? Because I don't subscribe to cloud chasers. I'm just a piece of shit. The 50-star supercut, yeah, that would be really nice. If I had infinite time, I would do that. Or if I didn't have a full-time job, I would definitely make a supercut like that. Big fan of this shape here. Yeah, I don't think anyone's gonna hate me for just chasing cloud. Because people generally just like me already. But if I was Logan Paul or something, people would hate me for it. Hmm. I do want to make a little update patch for The Missing Link 2. That's honestly the one thing I really want to update. Because I think Missing Link is a near-perfect game. There's just a few small mistakes. I have to sneeze. Yeah, but I was still super busy, Mushy. I just don't get any free time. You sneezed and an ad came up? Was it for tissues? Any particular example for chasing cloud? Making only up 64?  You want the burger? Dude, Leela, why are you so hungry today? Do you guys also imagine Leela as just being like 4'10 and like 95 pounds? You know the people that send you like an image of a small cat and going if you're angry at me, this is literally who you're angry at? That's how I imagine Leela. Hello, Wahoo. Walkies in Mario 64. I can make that for SimpleFlips. I can make that happen.  It's also data. It is also data. I love it how I'm progressing my full level remaking. Wait, you're remaking your level before the others even finish their level? Color packs are awesome. A subscription? Thank you for the $2 donation. Is it a song? I miss getting songs. Is it? What's going on? Is it not? Why is there no song? Let me log in to Streamlabs. Bang, a song playing. Wait, you hear the song? He is trolling me. No, you're trolling. There's no song. There was also a Prime sub. Where is the song? Let me go to my dashboard, maybe. No, I see nothing. The hell? It's not in my recent updates.  It's not in my recent events. Did it break? Don't buy the data. He would. What the fuck? Oh, wait, you did this on YouTube. Wait. Can you just... What the hell? Alright, you just send it to me on Discord, that works. Let's give it a try. You guys like my keyboard ASMR? Tetris? It's this year. Tetris? You don't like me saying Tetris? Tetris? You don't like me saying fuck either? I fucked this up again. Oh my god, that's so annoying. This needs to render after. What the hell am I listening to? Oh, someone asked what I thought of Lego Fortnite. I actually did play Lego Fortnite on Thursday. The thing at Gifts for Breakfast where we're allowed to play games for two hours with the team and get paid for it. And let me tell you. I'm really glad I got paid for that time because... That was fucking miserable. I would not ever play that fucking shit again. Lego Fortnite is so bad. The others liked it though. But, you know, this is just my personal thing. I fucking hate it.  When you also play Fortnite, we don't. We also play Lethal League. Someone go get them a drink. That's what I was thinking just like You have blend I installed You learn game development. You can just make a game. Why are you making a game in fortnight? It's fine you don't even like video games, yeah That's fair, that's honestly why I preface this with the others like that because I knew that it's just me hating it I'm watching on both twitch and YouTube. Thank you very much for the view inflation. We have 130 viewers the fuck That's nice you post face it because he said it afterwards that's true I post faced it You remember the good old trick of just insulting the viewers worldview to get them to click on your video I Should do that more like even with just twitch chat I should just say some completely wild shit and then afterwards correct myself all the time And we enjoyed the Sun I didn't but thank you for the song You're in case inflation for explanations, I don't think actually there might be some stuff you find There might be some sonico scene it's just called case that's just I'm gonna start debating with me on how texture cash works. I just mine Here's a regular name no, but you know sonico sees Good one time I tried to research what a blimp would look like if both I had one Do not Google Bowser blimp Worst mistake of my life If they don't make multiplayer, yep, there might be a multiplayer version of this You Google and pass on I know what I'm pass on this It's there who sits on stairs Oh, I see Yeah, sit and stare seems reasonable You  Fucking name Aza as I you should just bully robot for the rest of his life about or in the multiverse It would be funny and justified And you'd be like the only one who can do it. You're the chosen one on this one because you actually finished your level This is not a Tetris level this is smash 64 bought the platforms You finish your fallout personally, I believe you You Wait, mr. Morton person that you're gonna Google if you Google it That's just a chess move, right Right But I can be mean to run this because everyone else yeah you again that's exactly right what you're saying He chose to be What are they doing with the heck right now anyway, what was the strategy for when this would inevitably happen Surely something was planned ahead for it, right? But Carla is my ceiling white I didn't even have to look up I knew from memory You You know, what's crazy how come modern medicine hasn't found a way to make your fingernails stop growing yet Wouldn't that be so helpful and would save you so much time over the span of your life They're not our biggest problem, but they seem like a pretty low-hanging fruit to solve no today not I Also, they just hand off the levels to someone else, you know what I would have done I would have tried to find 20 people or 25 And then I would have just put in all the levels that got done And then it's like if you didn't finish your head, it's not three levels not gonna be put into the heck I feel like that could work Doesn't be like yeah, fuck it. Maybe you have 16 levels. Maybe a 40 levels. It is fine By this obsession with 15 Accusations but accusations, what did I miss? Hello moon for that I miss an accusation What I'm I'm being accused of this time That's a chat fun, that's very ugly Minecraft I can try changing it But the restream app only comes with a handful of themes so we can have like fortnight or world of tanks or something something like that I'll come on. I think he hasn't made peanut butter substitute actually tastes like peanut butter. I don't know Not a peanut butter fan don't care It Was a game that we need something you say I think there's a man who's going to let that slide in the triggered video Shit they got me they know Okay, but the idea is That the retro levels are all in 64 before the n64 and that so this is fine by my rules There's also gonna be a paper Mario retro level Do You think he's gonna look at this and be like man. They should have used hotel Mario or man. They should have used Mario is missing. You know the one with the history where you go back in time as Luigi or whatever You think anyone's gonna be like man, that's that's the biggest issue I have with this game I just wish the retro levels for more like shitty old games that no one liked and There's actually good games You Do you think nothing even he actually still wants a big room level after the simple flips competition after ever like 50,000 big room levels. I Feel like no Oh No, we have culling enabled Culling is ain't unnecessary vertices So this is quite a few polygons, but it will work out Iris is absolutely going to keep being better than Emmy. I'm sorry. What Oh In this video one of the shot is it evils that big house kingdom would fit the game perfectly it's not real No way I Was time machine was history more is missing this geography in my mind there was just one of those times But can you debug with the Leela and can you come to play games with it? That's the thing I care about and people can play my games And How easy is it to play games with that dog Yeah, I think we got the vibe I Think this exactly has survived from game Dude that's crazy. Look at that. What color is this? What color is Mario looking at here this long bar? This is a blue, what is this purple purple blue violet rip of Indigo I'm a blue Vinny. Let's fuck that because this is blue. This is just blue There's no purple in here It's literally just blue I Nearly like your place. No, it's just an optical illusion. Yes. The other colors here make it look like blue And no, it's not just blue no, it's it's like a desaturated blue But I don't like that it looks like this yes It's not like this Hmm Our edges look a lot sharper than they do in Smash Bros. I don't like that. I Think this is a bit of an issue. Hmm. Let me try something I Maybe they overlap too much It no, I don't want that How am I I'm good, oh, you mean No, there are no rats here that's the thing there's not a single piece of red than this whole thing Well, I accept for the platforms somehow what we did looks shitty though, I think we don't quite have it yet Yours is too perfect. Yeah angry. I need to change to walk here just come out here That's a lot better already I Don't like even care but It was something Maybe a skybox your coat though. And I think it works as this I wanted to move space But someone's mash bros have tilted them really I Don't think so. I don't see the tilt GTM yep, we're multi-streaming It feels that way I think the edges feel a lot fuzzier because it's such a low-res texture. I Think that changes a lot But also like what the fuck is going on over there, you know what I mean I Think this is a render order issue. I think the render order is wrong. It's parent Maybe not an order should be fine Hmm All right, this is my distance no a Slow slow spin We could yeah, I feel like a spin might work It's kind of a different vibe, but it could work. I Overlaps your two and we have right there. I Think I don't like how the white makes it look you red So I'm gonna try this If this looks better Virtual boy game no It could work but I don't think there are any good virtual boy games Also Nintendo themselves doesn't really acknowledge that I'll show you a preview animation This is my customization rig and work well enough. I don't know. Is it like a Mario animation? Virtual girl. Nope, just boys This is the 90s girls don't exist, I'm sorry Okay, I'm gonna change to up here I Still look so purple. I don't want in purple I What about this check in the front number in the middle of the page LMAO Morris early years of preschool fun This is not a very popular retro game, I believe you're not doing this I Was going to the different layers would be cool if they go in different directions since there's a landmark of purple So this can make it look like they're moving. Yeah, I can't do that. Oh Yeah, those colors are much better All right, let's give it a slow spin I suppose Hmm What is the best way to give this a spin The problem is that this is annoying to set up Brizzy case breezy, but you mean to say British If he's coming to the end, but there's a person asking about patreon billing shit where where we are did I miss it I Don't such a skirt to get better Like as a one-time thank you tip because I'm not made of money and it says I will build in January So that's patreon bill after a month immersion period you can send it. Yeah. Yeah, you have to cancel after the 1st of January and Then it will go bill you once and then not again. I Don't know you men do will I care that's like up to you to decide if I care or not like try and predict it I'll try it then It's up cancer right away and get that once really how it works never subscribe to anyone on patreon Okay, so this will be attached With a rotation matrix What if we can? We had a function note here just one That's two That's three what does fast 64 export now You Yeah, sure mama that works I mean you don't need to donate that way You want to you can just donate by a message. You can even get a song request that way or you Just not donate which would be depressing for me okay so this puts the geo asm right here now can i add this as a rotation node if i rotate this here will fast64 export this as a geo rotate yes or no come on okay oh my god this is shit it adds a geo rotation node and then it adds the geo asm that's so annoying but it works it works it will work this is the stupidest thing ever okay geo rotate smash background um the parameter let's have one parameter be the rotation speed and then the other direction so let's do 0xh7 maybe and you rotate this slightly and then we have to be shit how did i call the other one geo rotate smash background okay this one will be zero to smash background 0x um this should be slightly faster i think so let's try nine and then this one should be the other direction again and maybe even slower like 0x85 and i need to rotate it slightly let's see what this exports us enjoy thank you very much let's see it is this like a fast64 rig what is this it's been working animations for a while let me very cyberspace yep that's the idea i did not rotate this one maybe aa transparent needs to be rotated so if we have it this way we can just have the geo asm find its parent from the hash link map and then use that to set the parameter in the geo rotation nodes how long is the sun three minutes it felt like forever so  the geo rotation nodes x and 360 angle format no no way marie64 would be programmed like this okay wait this is semi-reasonable actually i think yeah look they just divided by 180 so we can just add to the jaw yeah patreon is really weird as a tip is probably easier patreon is supposed to work as like an income for the creator but maybe as a donation thing so it's possible to use open ai api to use cgpdn64 gambling not today but maybe someday in the future it's also not dependent on object let's make sure it compiles return gfx always return zero why are you using wsr why not what would you like me to use instead gargoyle in text yep i need network support for what so finding the parent is not as simple as going node parent in this game it's because i refactored the code to not store the parent here and it stores the parent in a hash map um find value wait is that enough so how do i find the parent oh oh that's how it works right  if not translation location translate does this work? invalid use of undefined time to graph not link it's not the point in the z-buffer is it? yes let's include the z-buffer here oh i'm not including buffers at all it should be invalid initializer then again trying to tell me that i would be able to make godfather level fully ai movie in the next 10 months i don't know about that he never responded very strange truly very very strange hello cadx yearly visit you're lucky you can visit this is my first stream on twitch for a long time well i mean you don't have to provide help for my project's email although if you do say you're gonna then i think you kind of do have that responsibility like as soon as you agree to it uh error invalid initializer oh i forgot a star there we go so all right let's give it a try if everything works it's good if it doesn't work that's also not surprising i heard that ko-fi was very good in relaying money what the fuck is ko-fi what is relaying money while using both snake and camel case man i simply do not care this is not what i wanted first of all it's way too fast and second of all it's not inverting as desired i don't even know what snake and camel case means i usually just capitalize the first word the rest is still from vanilla mario 64 i guess that's why the cases are messed up i'm still going to send action as well yeah hmm hmm oh ko-fi i see i see i never used the website i don't know much about it oh okay this is gonna call context oh well they both suck i just use whatever epic games coding standard is because that's what i have to do at work they're so fast what the hell is the parameter wait a second i think i think this is not how it works oh it should be all fine maybe it's in geo asm macro i closed the one thing i wanted to keep open awesome um well making the switch right now would be a stupid idea anyway 0.07 um it's less than that it's 65 no it's uh like 7 divided by 6 5 5 3 6 it's this much of a circle every frame so it should take one divided by this divided by 60 it should take 156 seconds to rotate once you subscribe but i don't think it'll appear on screen yeah notification notifications seem to be broken i have to bring them back so i'll just use the rotation speeds one two and three see how that works out what has case been up to just living my life modding mario rotation speed one looks good to me rotation speed two looks very valuable and rotation speed three is way too fast i guess this is just an unfortunate situation of how it is still we need to figure out how to make this go the other way um it could be that the parameter just gets set to zero which would suck in which case i can just do this yes so let's try it what if someone parted star road i lost them back to bc that would be nice what would you do if a nuke landed right next to you right now die pet my cat one last time i don't have a cat i wish i had a cat i remember a few days ago i had a dream that maxwell the cat was sitting on my blanket he was just sitting there staring at me all the red underlines make you want to die i'm begging you to update your include path or something eh there's not that many i don't know how to fix it we tried it before it sucked and then it is what it is if someone knows to fix i'll try it if no one knows then the middle one is so fast what is actually going on here could it be that the issue was brackets so instead of the smash beam of light animation falling into the void that'd be really cool how does a basic and operation not work am i losing it i'm printing this now  one two and nine it's one two and nine but they all rotate to the left oh is this possible surely that wouldn't do something yeah it just looked too shit without the background code so i had to do it that was it and it was just the order of operations god damn it oh that's so reassuring to know cat x wow saved my day the blob is wrong let's fix that as well real quick so zero x a and this is x one zero did i put fuck how did i do this wrong so the green seems a little too slow okay here's the deal we can make it twice as fast or we can make it the same speed those are our two options i think the green is fast enough it may seem a little slower because it's like right in front of us it's the same speed as the blue actually yeah the green and the blue are the same speed so one thing i still want to think about is how we fade out the platforms at the bottom because i don't like the way this is i'm thinking maybe i'll set up a combiner to fade into the blue but that also looks bad i also can't fade into alpha maybe we just have to leave it  tetrasphere i've never played tetrasphere but i have like a shitty little game game boy that i got a few days ago that can it just runs retro arch and it can play like all these retro games and that come with tetrasphere pre-installed i gave it a try for a little bit but yeah i'm a fake tetris fan Actually, I'm not even that I'm not even pretending to be a Tetris fan At half Top eight half sphere with the texture that fades into the top and At half feet half sphere for the texture that feeds into transparency at the top look at the bottom what What am I reading that can't make sense out of these words? Oh you want this to fade into white or something We could fade the background into white but I think I would look bad I'm saying the man was all the way to the blue part of the sphere and then fade to blue Yeah, that would be so huge so long Okay, next we need to design the platform in here I think I want the general shape to be like you go out into four paths and there's platforms to jump on and Then you get there We are going to make this with just block out platforms at first So all of the shit this your part of it. Oh, that's kind of annoying to edit So, let's just move these over here for now just put a bunch of block of platforms and then keep going And I'm so tired of the song. I need a new OST Any OST wishes today I Can't do Mario sunshine anymore. I'm sorry. This is just pain Oh Mario RPG, let's do it Wouldn't be fun to actually get the super smash that enemies from our faults down Hmm Yeah, okay. No, it would be funny but like can we make that look fine considering how the camera is just gonna follow Mario I'm just gonna Smash together some random platforms and then after that, we're gonna see how to make them look fun This is the block out technique basically I Want some moving platforms to so like this platform could be moving up and down And I want this to ultimately align to some sort of tile right here There's a thousand units that's kind of huge actually Let's Make sure that we got the scale somewhat, right? Remember they used a few textures that follow the camera of the character despondent moments. Those the animation sections get loaded Mm-hmm. Yeah, but that doesn't work with Space Space Wait, wait shit. I missed the donation. What what the fuck? How did I miss this someone just donated 200 euros? 30 minutes ago, and I missed it holy fuck and Keen, thank you very much for the donation. Holy shit That is definitely helping How did I miss that how did no one tell me Now I feel bad for missing that oh Fuck So Generous We all missed it though the hell is it because my alerts don't work right now That's a bummer Movement is so smooth. It's not good yet Not a fan of how it is Like this platforms way too big this one needs to be an up-down platform, but it needs to be half the size All these platforms are just too big You True listen to my like it's a good idea You See how we get man, I think this will be a lot better I Feel like the multi stream is definitely the way to go We reach so many more people I become a bigger cultural event We have so many more people in chat I Said make sense that the players to jump that high here For this one. It makes sense. This is gonna be an up-down platform. So it works still and Then this works as well Yeah, I think this is nice I see other stream on twitch I Don't think I want to start streaming on Twitter. Can you imagine how terrible that would be? Somehow I have over 30,000 followers on Twitter I don't know how or who these people are, but they all just started following me I don't think most of them are familiar with my brand either. I think they just ran the people They might only know me from Twitter You So the bottom platforms of Mario also has some Something like this I cannot want I feel like a big wall I Put the next platform here and then make a path to reach it somehow You have a bunch of bots joining telling you and they are GFX artists and check out their work And they will let you know that he can write an essay for you Man I have a 15 word essay do it tomorrow and I'm still up hacking Mario 64 That's crazy, bro So wild for that one I Did you say 15 when I say up 15 word essay This is just me being stupid I Don't fuck sitting in X. Yes The Atari Yagra the thing is I don't care about our target at all I Actually used to be Mario He would tell me always when I was a kid he used to be Mario before he retired I don't know who is Mario now, but it used to be my dad President's talking about my dad the Mario. Yep. That's him Haven't finished doing a play for that means like that's true But you just haven't been enjoying it as much in the end Just get a good board of it Why the hell am I using one right? Why do you think that So This will be an up-down platform Kind of like this like that few small jumps in a row. It's kind of a cool section This one's pretty easy to do I don't know if this one is easy enough I Get that's definitely not the intended way of doing it. I Think I need to move that one down a bit so that people can like get on here do a long jump and get up there It's Like hearing him talking to a microphone what my stream sounds like me talking into microphone, that's insane No way that's my stream sound like talking into a microphone Yes, this is to smash for 64 Basically in return to use islands every course out of the 15 main courses has a retro bit section and They are inspired by a retro game that came during the n64 or before that and this one has smashed for 64 You So we definitely need a lava section to And only talk like that when I have both streams open, okay, I'm sorry I will wait for you to have both streams open before I talk like that again Hopefully you allow me soon I think you deserve a platform for doing this. Maybe one more jump I Will anyone actually land on the red part here, I'm not sure Need to get a vibe check for this one The day if I bring them back, I don't think so Is you were confused on what I meant by half sphere fade on the background. I showed an example on this I Get my message requests is a six months ago. Oh I Could accept it. Yeah. Yeah girl keeping game bossing So you wanted to fade into black at the bottom Well, we don't need a house here for that You just want to free the vertex color to black I Mean we can do that. Yeah Is that any good though, that's what I'm wondering the easiest way would be to just change this to shade color It's To our previous print color See your shade should probably like start maybe one less like here Values point one four, we have one two, three Four five levels. It's a five point one four to a five besides Is This what you were thinking basically We'll be spinning when you want to spin so it all faded. Oh, I see you see I Well, we couldn't apply in the same multiplication with this year, but I Think I think over this background, it's fine. But over all of it Hmm I mean, it's still just like a small piece at the bottom. We could increase the size of the crater I don't know if I want the colors of the actual well, actually That's not a Derping When came are you modeling Mario 64 I Do like the black hole at the bottom I Feel like this jump is just too difficult. Well, actually you can if you really want and we are in course 11 Maybe it's fine to have a slightly more difficult jump here. It's not like you have to do this I'll jump here. Of course you can long jump That was an interesting bug though, I wasn't supposed to detach from that edge. Luckily the RTYI camera is perfect, so we can just set it up. I think I want a bigger landing area here, and then I'm fine with this. Like so. I don't see any reacts. The anti-mirror cam has one thing that bugs me, what is it? I'm always open to try and improve the camera. I fixed one camera bug recently, if it's that exact thing you're complaining about, then that will be the funniest thing ever. Small d-pad adjustments shouldn't have sine interpolation and should just be linear. Oh, they don't have sine interpolation. They are at first very small, and the longer you hold them, the faster they get. That's because I wanted to work as a small adjustment, but I also wanted to work as a main camera option. Let me show you. You don't like the smooth camera in the Onio Pack? This is the same camera as in the Onio Pack. If you didn't use the snappy camera and only up, that's literally just your own fault. By making it have a bit of a velocity, you can do a minimal adjustment like this, but you can also use this as your main camera button. That's what I want, honestly. I'm guessing you only wanted a minuscule adjustment like this, and that's why this is better for you? Is that what's going on? We're talking about cameras. What was the method you used to turn yours into a light source? Because the way I did was that I... Attack a specific light source to the camera directly. At the light that comes from the camera. I just do this. It can work as both. If you want to make precise adjustments, the smoothing messes up. And if you want to use it as a main camera button, it all starts frustrating. I am using it as both, and it works for me. Hmm. Maybe I need to change the curve of this building then for you. Because people that use it as a slow rotation button, they're not going to be pro players. They're going to be very slow players, so they're not going to mind a bit more startup. Hmm.  Yeah, I see what you mean though. Like, tapping it for one frame moves out half as much as tapping it for two frames. So, do you want it always to be slow, or do you want it to be even less? What is it here? Hmm. I could put it above a threshold. Hmm. Hmm. Let me try this. Hmm. Let's have this be like... I will have this be 37.5F. And then I will set the acceleration to be like... Much slower, like 10.5 maybe. And then... Actually, let's have this be 37 to keep the first frame the same. Yeah, but the adjustment is so slow. It's like such a weird hack feature, you know what I mean? More like a feature you would have in a toolset than a feature you would have in a game. It's just too slow, I find. Actually, I think the base velocity needs to increase. And then the acceleration needs to decrease. How about this? Actually, 75. 75 should be fine. And then... Let's do this. Okay. Actually, we might not even need this. Let's try this, see if it feels good. This is closer to how ParallelCam would do it, but it still has my acceleration feature that I want. Hello, Brawl Dude. It's a bit to compile. This is a small enough adjustment. I think this works for you. I mean, this is a pretty small adjustment you can make. Like, even if you have really small fingers, you can make a small adjustment. You can also make small adjustments like this. You can see that. Well, some people just prefer the slow rotating camera where they have to let go. That's why. It's literally the whole reason. I think this is a bit too much, then. Let's try, like, 580. Let's see. No one's going to think I was... Well, that's because people are so used to the other thing. You can get them used to another thing. No, I'm not letting Lance change this stuff. These are all the options you get. I don't like the cluttered options menu. This feels fast enough for bad players. But it still gives you the option to slightly align if you want. Like, even if you need 4 frames, it's still going to be a relatively consistent length. We'll just try this. Maybe it's better, maybe not. If not, then I'm lucky. Woohoo! What other ideas can we use here? We should also use the arrow, actually. The arrow, like, the arrow down there. I need that texture. That arrow looks good. I think I can find it in the Smash remakes. I have one texture pack downloaded somewhere. Somewhere. What the hell? What Atari games are there that are to be fans of? I never played on an Atari console. That was before my time. I am not that old. Is this for an item? For an item? No, no, we want the arrows. Not an item. What do you mean the grenade? The grenade should be an item, but which one? I don't remember there being a realistic grenade in Smash Bros. Other than Snake and Brawl. I'mma dip. Alright. Bye bye. This is not me ending the stream. This is me saying bye to Aza. Do not get confused. Sometimes I say bye to someone and everyone thinks I'm ending the stream. It has happened before. Trophies. I feel like it didn't. Hey, hey, oh my god, there's so many of those. No biobank. Guys, do you want to hear my worst opinion yet? I promise you this will be the worst one. I think... I think Studio Ghibli movies are kinda really just very boring. Don't like them at all. In-game. I think that doesn't work anymore. There was some guy that did that and they got arrested for it. It's actually crazy that you can get arrested for saying three letters like that. I don't know.  Even Spirited Away? Yeah. I watched Spirited Away with Zayna for the first time. That's pretty mean. Kinda just boring. You see the movie with the flying Italian pig? Porco Dio? Could be useful. I don't think we want to use any of this. Opinions on FNAF movie. I was never into FNAF. So I didn't watch the FNAF movie. I know, shocker. Mario movie. Very well executed fan service. Probably very boring if you're not a Mario fan. But if you're a Mario fan, it's like, oh look. It's the guy I know. Neat. You can't just not watch it? Well, I just did. What you gonna do about it? I don't know. FNAF movie? 10 out of 10 fan service, 5 out of 10 movies? Yeah. Well, I would say 10 out of 10 fan service and like 2 out of 10 movies. We have similar opinions here. There's only one true Garfield movie for me. And it's made by Lasagna Cat. This one here. It's a one hour analysis of a single Garfield script. And the guy is just bullshitting the entire time. This is what your English teacher wants you to think about when you read a piece of literature. The curtains are blue. Really? That's all that's going on here? I don't think so. No, I'm just saying this is the real Garfield movie to various. Can we continue to play games where this movie has confusing nonsensical articles, weird scenario and has an incomplete ending? This movie that was not made for me. Not really my taste. Okay, but to be fair, if you write a book and you specifically mentioned that the curtains are blue and there's no reason that they are blue, like, why the fuck did you put that in your book? Actually, genuinely. Who cares if it doesn't matter?  We don't envision the world. I guess. Yeah. I'm using a writing stream, but yeah. I think that when you speak you should be precise and you should be concise those are the two qualities i value the most in speech although book is more entertainment than like informative speech so i think the rules are a little bit different i think it's different from making an so no one acknowledged leela if you acknowledge leela you are part of the group she's speaking to you would be coming out of the closet unless you are gay in which case feel free to respond to leela i did someone redeem the water thing shit i can't see it anymore i'm thinking we can replace z plus a sorry to move with something more similar to z s summons in order to fall on the opposite side one somersault ea the ground part the long jump not replacing the long jump okay well i drank my water i have to think about something to do about the whole switch rewards thing it's confirmed for gay no am i gay now how am i gonna tell zena so i had to fuck up the sandbag at the end for the start funny but not really fitting i don't think the sandbag even existed in this game did it was there a sandbag in this game so the yeah no sandbag so what if you made the player walk between here nothing made the player walk down here oh that would be my bill so and to offer promotion of your channel viewers follow us oh my god the follower bots i can finally get famous again for cheap we are so back so so never was there a cheaper way to get famous do you guys think if you had mr beast amount of money you could also make a very successful youtube channel out of it or would it be too difficult so Why is this being weird? And where is that way around? That's bizarre, all right those are our first four platforms let's just make sure they all work Do you think all the people that are making those bots are famous themselves? They're like man I got a million followers I want to share my success Okay Mr. Meese to do it for you that's true You know what I don't understand how come not every company just hires a bunch of Indian dudes to do all their work for them Like every programming company marketing company everything Indian dudes literally work for so cheap and they're most of the time more skilled than North Americans too I think Why don't they do that? Their architecture looks like ass it's literally ripped Actually it might be upscaled I ripped it from the tech subheck It should look better India's advanced dude Yeah I'm saying why don't they do that? There's I was thinking about getting thumbnails done for a bunch of old videos And they make decent thumbnails and they take five dollars per thumbnail five dollars How are they gonna do that? Could hire a whole social media team for like 500 dollars a month it feels like They can take the company's profit off of them and export the money elsewhere instead of hiring locals it's a short version Local power gens get ticked off? No one would ever find out Okay that's way too difficult to do This jumps fine honestly it's just a little bit difficult but this shouldn't it's not Okay customer service is the one thing you can't outsource though because this is public facing It's like the worst thing to outsource Wait if the worst thing to outsource is outsourced maybe basically everything is outsourced and we just don't know You know the funniest shenever I got there's um sometimes I get messages from companies and they're like test this thing for us and make a review on it on your youtube we'll give it to you for free and I always say yes I like getting free shit and then I don't make the youtube video but they have sent me a blu-ray speaker from China and the speaker has voice comments and the voice comments only work if you speak to it with the Chinese accent And the speaker has a Chinese accent too it's so dumb Yes this is for rtyui They will blackmail me later on now And I'll be honest if I ever get cancelled I'll I'll just start doing the Donald Trump thing I'm like oh they they want to cancel me they're all so sensitive we need to stop this and then I'll rally people behind me like that Fuck it if I'm going down we're all going down I'm taking society with me See the left is trying to cancel me already they are added as we speak I don't want to watch the clip is there anything important in there that I need to know Bloody black what is this I'm sure there's an explanation for this That's the clip the hell There isn't I think oh what what did I do Okay let me see this Oh okay well I think that's a fair question Someone just took the totes and made them black I think it's fair to ask why I mean isn't that the game where they gave all the characters like really big boobs like obviously I'm gonna be into that It is no secret that I'm a heterosexual male Controversial character wait what You have adult rex big boobs like the t-rex Oh that's just a woman with giant boobs the hell That is a fucking weird character design how do you put that in a game that just instantly makes a game a weird sex game if you have characters like that Dude look at this character you can't tell me that's like a normal character what the fuck is this what is this Oh my god that was so long ago three years I looked so weird back then All right we have four platforms down they all seem pretty nice and reachable now I will put this here I think that's cooler All right that explains it all I think I want this to look a bit different I'll make it work kind of like this I think that's gonna look cool okay I think halfway done here that's good enough we've done a lot of work today I'll go back to my video editing cave and end my stream for today My complaint with this is very similar to the mario bros retro pipe It will be very different now this is different this is not linear this is like all of it but we'll talk about this later I'll end the stream for now bye-bye
