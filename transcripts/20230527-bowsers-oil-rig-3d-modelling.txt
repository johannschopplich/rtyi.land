You you you hello hello hello case issue hello Lilaa yeah my microphone unplugged when I so I have recently made the decision that we're gonna remake some of the old retro areas because they're much smaller than the rest of the retro areas and they could be easy much is there any more Bowser's animations that you need or can I send these off and work on the NPCs I can't think of any other animations I need right now okay I'm going to save this oh god I only have audio in one ear no so the video today I decided to update the fog and I think this looks a lot better what do you think hello errands you guys like this I also updated the lights I think the light is really cool now I've decided we're gonna do a little polishing face on return to Yoshi's Island where we're just gonna polish up a bunch of old things or it should be bluer yeah he's fine just like a road bridge physics kind of poggers poggers this is an interesting issue let me fix that real quick that is that one's not my fault I promise I blame bio back there we go either way we are working on the oil rig today okay well I can't really do it right now that's fine why is it called hot one because it's the this is the third time he's in the intricate scene buzzer one fight and now both are to fight I don't know the beginning of the game I don't think I did but are you just sticking to his idle animation or do we do you want now here's some shouting animation to and like a few pulses do you have any NPCs for me to fix nope or I mean I can give you some you want to do the buzzy beetles yes all right the buzzy beetles should be pretty simple she's highland course to then buzzy we know they just have a walk animation and they're going to shell animation we've seen a new work cycle in action no I haven't actually implemented any both animations yet so it's gonna be like a whole buzzer fight we have to make either way I've made a bit of progress on this what about the magic show oh shit the magic show also still needs to be done the magic still is like not even started yet I need to implement the whole thing still so I've only made some pretty basic platforming stuff here I've also already laid out where all the balls are NPCs are gonna be in the first part of the level and there will be a place where you have to shoot to we need to fix the cannon camera holy shit like up there is where you use the cannon for and then there will be a switch here and if you press the switch the crane will move and there will be like a thing here that the demolition sphere you guys know what I'm talking about and the demolition sphere will knock off Bowser's hat yeah for then I kind of updated all the lib ultra things including the translation matrix thing and kind of broke the old rectacle I think that's what it is maybe something else broke it actually something else now that I think about it something else broke it at any rate I'm just gonna remake that whole cannon rectacle anyway because the way is rendered is atrocious how's the camera wallet detection pretty good well then that one's probably a bad example of it I'll show you like in here so if you go near a thing and there's it's gonna block the camera like that it's gonna go in but if this is inside level geometry like this path here added this this post here it's not gonna block the camera right so only outside level geometry is gonna block the camera like that so let's get back to the oil rig or do you guys want to see the retro section remake what's the magic show basically Bowser has okay this is a very secret thing it's an easter egg you can't find it under normal circumstances but if you do a specific thing you can enter Bowser's magic show and Bowser just sounds like a bunch of really bad jokes on there and does a few bad magic tricks and that's it yeah the magic show is not a new level theme so you can see I have a few notes here it looks like it's 9,000 triangles but most of it is the text here I don't mind space on my next account no it's gonna be like is sawing a pokey in half or and stuff like that because he like pokies can already be soon in half you know or like making someone disappear and then he makes a boot disappear basically he just does a bunch of magic tricks that don't work so we got this mission to us the minions are striking and you just fucking knock Bowser's head off let's draw the demolition sphere here how's the what is the proper name for that I'm sure it's not called demolition sphere I mean this wrecking ball yes right there was that whole song about a I did not mean to put my wrecking ball here it's 80 triangles that's a lot I thought it would be but that's fine demolition sphere yes wrecking ball is just demolition sphere isn't it stupid then we have both the wall the words ball and the word sphere what's the difference between a ball in the sphere no fake 2d sprite no it's way too big for that it's not gonna work well as a 2d sprite balls can be ellipsoids or like a football right yes you can use it as a 2d image for that but it's gonna look like ass if it's so big how's yours because I have an icosphere they are a little bit rounder looking for less triangles so icospheres are just better what I will see do we pick for today something let's do a summer list let's do something summary summary like Mario what is digga like Laura hello Laura love bye I don't know who you are but Lilaa seems very excited about you shit did you guys hear I found this out yesterday bad stuff is happening to Elon Musk he started taking like a weight loss drug that is like really bad for you and it's most likely just gonna fucking murder him you mean he's just gonna murder himself by taking those drugs that's exactly what I said I feel that would be a good idea to name some guys are my level to plane collision since you don't collide with the other side sometimes that seems like your level is just fucked nothing to do with planes well don't tell him yeah I expected that sentiment what did I say yesterday Elon Musk is not a person he's an entity no like I this is a good little conspiracy theory that I believe but at some point when you have so much money at your disposal you don't become you cease to become human anymore you are just an entity that exists with too much money either way so usually you know if you're overweight and you want to lose weight then usually the weight do you lose it's gonna be like at least 80% fat and maybe 20% lean mass right and your heart rates gonna go down because your heart has to work less hard but the weight loss drug he uses it causes people to lose a shit ton of weight but almost two-thirds of that was a lean mass and their heart rate went up so they're losing weight but essentially they're getting fatter like more of their body becomes fat essentially speaking and their heart just fucking explodes and for some reason he's doing that he just decided death was an option yeah painful death is his option hello XPM hello excellent gamer dude how hard is it to find just the texture for a sphere it's a bit less glaring Laura blender will give you will be your your godson is good you know what fuck this we're going retro retro we're doing this I love that the first the second image is just Miley Cyrus yeah let's try this let me just see how this looks I wish I wait myself at the beginning of infection cuz I'm probably gonna have lost kills by the end damn that doesn't sound fun okay so I made a random question do you ever playing at least one time on a pinball machine I've never played on a real pinball machine but I have played space pinball from like Microsoft XP hello tantrum boy honestly looks decent to me I don't completely hate it doesn't have to pinball level yet oh we're planning a casino level for sauna we're getting there we're making the pinball real like oh look the sunshine pinball sucked the lost impact pinball sucked maybe even the 60 fall in pinball sucked let's make another one this time for real all right we need to make more level so mission free both ascends enemy to break the strike the enemy gives you a star so we need a place where they are striking and Bowser this place needs to be accessible the whole way through and I guess we should combine this with four because there needs to be a thing where you can platform through the power generator so there needs to be a path from here to here and the power generator here and there needs to be like a platform here that's right in front of Bowser's house here the question is how do we make Bowser's office look like because I think Bowser's should be a place you enter I like the idea of a mini castle but I want the castle to be like inside the cave oh wait hold on like how inside the cave do you want this to be like and basically I just need it to be a secluded area for like performance purposes hang on let me see if I can find something I mean pinball sounds fun all-star but I just never got to play it anywhere I think it costs money to play it so I just never played it I don't like to spend money this doesn't look good well it is not gonna be what's actually in the game this is just temporary geometry oh like a castle half in a mountain like that yes yes well I mean the purpose of this though is that we don't have to render that much so we can't really do that you could have like the roof of it and you could just enter from the chimney no no this has to be like the official entrance to Bowser's castle we can't just get into it like that case this you'll thank you for the $5 can you explain when this game will come out so it's programming and I'm curious it's difficult to estimate the thing is I do have a full-time job so I can't spend that much time on it I'm trying to get it done in a timely manner but we are only two-thirds through the game and it's been like almost three years now yeah I mean we're probably more than two-thirds done because a lot of engine changes are already made but realistically it's still gonna be at least like a year and a half tomorrow okay yeah tomorrow what's your job I am a programmer at gears for breakfast I program in Unreal Engine this also would be like 50% he's a chunk of chair true he punches puppies professionally if that paid better I would so where in this mountain do you want the castle entrance it doesn't even need to be in on it just needs to be a cool entrance that is secluded we can have there be like mountain walls like this and then maybe like two towers and then the huge entrance in front yeah that could be cool that could kind of work cuz like I found this image here that kind of describes it maybe yeah I don't need a I have seen it there's also the issue that we kind of wanted this to be the top level there's also the idea that maybe this is gonna be like a clear pipe far away the wrecking ball doesn't look good maybe I mean all right fine let's try it with the texture you never heard my wife's voice before I guess she's often quiet in the background I'm usually just helping him doing stuff usually she's a loudmouth excuse me good sir am I wrong you're not wrong not entirely I'm pretty naturally loud yes Lilaa I can talk shocking I know There, is that wrecking ball better? Actually, I want to change the texture a little bit, but I do think it's a lot better already. I found a second-hand switch light for 90 euros. Do you think you should buy it? If it still works, then yeah, you should buy it and just resell it No, it's a sister-in-law troll If I had a girlfriend, my wife would be very disappointed, true Oh There we go Third cousin twice removed What does that mean So Are we going see if we're going with that idea though? I mean, let me look at the cave again Because I feel like the cave looks terrible right now Posted a mock-up of the new air, but when you're making a new air, but where is it? Where can I see it I Did not see it Nice line Yeah, so that whole thing looks terrible it's just looks so much less detail than anything else in the scene So we can't have this I think But If we had both this castle also be on like oil rig things like this and it just looked like a basic castle from the outside With the basic gate to open That's not even possible what's not even possible It's in a modding channel, it's very life, that's what I don't expect much. Oh You're online with the new dials, it's just a suggestion. Oh I see Okay, this looks cool, but how the fuck am I supposed to do this How do I program this I mean I guess it's possible still like hmm Hmm I guess there's some combiner math you could do for this. I agree. It looks a lot better It's not that hard, how would you do it I Don't want to add like a million vertices to this That's the issue Use a random tutorial on the logic what? No, I'm thinking of an efficient way to do it if I have a million vertices obviously I can just change like the vertex color All right, let's try the idea with just having bozos castle here instead of this whole thing We could have a castle and then on the top there could be the blimp landing pads that we need a blimp pad even We do not The red coins are gonna be behind here Hold on. You're just gonna be over here when this level is gonna be really small if I do that though Since the shape is static you don't have to pre generate you can just mess with our scales from real time Yeah, but that's exactly what I wanted to avoid There won't be so many vertices How's the progress of banjo, okay, I can show you real quick the newest update We are still currently working on this part, I think there's 115 stars done now What's the last thing I did? I think I made nap out of this wife Oh God I missed the bar. There's snap nut on there snap. That's wife. That's the last thing we did He's just sleeping You know the ton of vertex rating red colors would be pretty quick since you not be doing math to decide to go No, not many. Yeah, I guess I guess I guess I would work Maybe that's what we do Nice death ball Okay, let's think about this again the problem I have here is that I don't want the level to be miniscule And right now it's looking like it's gonna be minuscule if we do this This is the idea here, right so we have permission one screen done if the crane entrance we have the reds done And not the reds the reds are gonna be like behind here So next it would be a bunch of like scaffolding shit just to get here But the entrance to bozos castle and a big landing pad in front And the landing pad is gonna be where you fight the boss Hello bio back. You didn't miss too much. Did you see the clip today by your back? Hi GTM Right, and then we have the power generator here, which we can also have a little bit of platforms here Oh, I guess the power generator is gonna go downwards. So it's not that small still the overworld feels so small to me now I don't like that I Don't like how small it feels, how can we fix that? I also made some slight changes to the level by a bag. I don't know if you're gonna hate or love it It's actually a pretty big change I'll just run it by you So I completely changed the way the fuck works It's now blue instead of black and Mario's different light a Student streaming been for you We can't as a viewers, but I'm fine with that as long as it means I don't have to put up with twitch's ads And basically the issue here is that The world feels too small if I just go with my current plan So we would have about 20 seconds of platforming here to get to the boss fight area and then from the boss fight area you Can also go here where there will be The power generator where you can go downwards, right? But then like we have this one linear section that goes here and we have a linear section here We have a semi linear red coin section here and then to the plan to the boss. There's like no platforming at all And then I guess there's gonna be a section inside of a Bowser's Castle burrow, whatever But it's also not much and we were planning In mid pipe, how do you get there? Oh There was a crane inside planned at first, I guess I didn't do that It's good as well doesn't really look like it's deep underwater main, but hey, I find that looks very underwater I  This is the office building basically where it would be inside the castle. I've painted that Every free the underwater area. I guess you can go on the one. Oh, okay. I know what we can do If We add entrances to go into the underwater area like all over the place and you could go from place to place I think that would add a lot But then we need like cool stuff to go into the underwater area Could be almost like a quick travel system actually And Then The 8-bit pipe could be like a secret entrance that you enter somewhere And the power generator would be in the same place I guess Yeah, I guess it would be in the same place and then why would you ever need to enter the power generator though Maybe it's a separate place. Actually, let's do that Yes, 45 entrances Okay, and the crane inside is just gone that makes the overall feel a lot bigger Yeah, my oh my couch a lot with the models he like whenever I finish a model he's looking over it again It makes it a lot prettier That Is part of the reason that this looks so much better than the demo The other part is obviously that the engine is a lot better and that I also improved at art Okay, I think it won't feel too small now now that I thought this out more But Let's set some entrances around them to the underground area How would we have these entrances look because we want Mario to go in and we also want them to go out and we want Them to all look the same so that they have a recognizable design and you will feel compelled to understand what is going on here And Entrance yes, they well the area is not gonna be underwater, right? But it's gonna be below sea level and there's gonna be water around you and maybe you'll see some sea creatures around and some like You know through windows. You will see stuff So There's gonna be three or four entrances to the underwater area here like maybe here here here and here and It's all connected and there is the entrance to the 8-bit pipe underground The animation is done very nicely But we also need to give the player a lot of stuff to find in the underwater area So definitely two Yoshi coins and the 8-bit pipe is a good start I Rx often have people in a diving suit attached to a rope would be cool if you had that as a mission. I Don't think we have that much freedom with the mission store because we have three story missions that are kind of necessary Then we have the red coins and the 8-bit pipe So there's just one mission left and the last mission was gonna be something with going down the power generator I don't think I want Mario to swim here I Don't know what that means Lilaa, how would you want to delete the generated animation file? What came for the retro pipe smash 64 Yeah, but we still need a design for this is my issue right now You'll be swimming to be more like metal cap, but they are innocent. Yeah I have a cool idea on how this should look Um Actually, it's my 64 is in Mario 64 A student observation Dude we recently played Pikmin 2. What do you before I say anything? What do you guys think of Pikmin 2? I Wonder what case I hate video games Emanuel thinks about Pikmin 2. I Wonder real big mystery here. I Pikmin 2 what the fuck you haven't played Pikmin 1 No, I shouldn't have connected these now I regret it I Did you get tears of the kingdom? Yeah, we just started playing like a bit ago We have like three or four hours in the game. I'm just gonna solve every puzzle as well as possible It seems there's some combinations of things you can do it that are just so broken though that they break like every puzzle Which I get is kind of the point of the game I Promise with Pikmin 2 is that Everything is kind of just like random AI generated dungeons and the game asks you to just beat all of them And there's like nothing to it. You don't actually make any choices. You just follow the right wall and Deal with every obstacle the game throws at you the way that the game asks you to deal with them You have no freedom. You're basically just like a worker drone. You're not actually playing a game. You're just doing what you're being told You might as well not be playing It's a mediation of the deaths when we are told them to code that What's with that blocker I Mean is a reimagining of big one. They need to add all the quality to a person who gives at it I don't know what quality of life and roots once they are. I only played one and two I'm not getting demonetized either. So well pigment 2 is basically all dungeons I Also, I don't have every video game sometimes I like video games tears of the kingdom so far has been really fun There I said it. There's a video game. I like I Have officially endorsed the video game I'm not using this somewhere else as well. I feel like oh right on the cannon. I Don't want this to be the same thing just a cannon I Okay case I like one video I know hey Is there any of your retro pipes going to the VG Sierra nope only n64 and earlier This is gonna be open source, of course. I Will open sources once it is released but not before because I would just be leaking my entire mod You Know what dr. Mario 64 is a possibility Yes, there's a Yoshi's Island retro pipe hello Maui Wait a week or two to release the source code for spoilers. Yeah, that too Also for you know Nintendo Because if you release the source codes, I feel like you can have a lot more trouble with Nintendo Boily oil rig and I am NOT up for that name I don't know if people will speedrun the hack. The thing with this hack is that the physics are so different that you're going to unlearn your normal Mario 64 muscle memory. So if you are a speedrunner and you want to speedrun this game, you kind of have to commit to only speedrunning this game. Because your normal Mario muscle memory is going to be so messed up by that. Why would that be? You're legit not using the Nintendo libraries anymore? Well, I have a Goomba model and I have a Mario model and, you know. I will get Dolphin. I heard that Dolphin put some of the encryption keys into their source code, which, that was just like a terrible move. Honestly, I'm kind of upset about that. They had this one shot to just be like, yeah, fuck Nintendo, we're just doing this anyway. And they kind of just ruined their shot by doing something stupid like that. Alright, I have returned. You know what I mean? Like if you want to beat Nintendo at their stupid game, you can't make those mistakes. Yeah, we literally have a boss called Mean Machine Robowser. It was only on Steam that it got shut down, the normal emulator did not. I have no idea what the implications of that are at all. Dude, my dreams recently have been getting weirder and weirder too. I don't even remember what's happening in them, I just remember that they're fucking wild. Everything just feels like a fever dream. That looks a bit blurry. Let's get it out more, I don't know. Let me still experiment with this. If it truly is too blurry, we can still just make it a multi-texture and just say like, oh, fuck it, we're making this grainy. But I don't know if I like that. Doesn't look that awful actually. That looks like a rock. Cool for you. Do you want the name of this level to be based around the Alrick or did you want something else? It doesn't really matter what the name is, it just needs to be a cool alliteration, so that it is easy to just go into your brain and remember the name. Can multi-texture make things have a normal map look? No. So it's just a number used to decrypt the Nintendo games? Yeah, but I don't know. I don't know if that's a fair game or not. I have an island. I have an island. Yes, there will be a boss here, but it won't be an island. It will be like an oil rig platform, which by the way, we still haven't decided what the boss of this level is. It's just like, okay, there's a strike going on and Bowser sends one of his big boys to break the strike. Like one of his loyal minions has to be really just like a fat enemy. So if you have an idea of what the boss should be, you are free to tell me. This is your one-time invitation to actually have an opinion. You will very rarely get this on the internet. Dripping dark deeps. Goopa Bloopa. Is Goopa Bloopa really a Bowser minion though? Is that what you think? Like, oh, this is Bowser's top guy. This is his top dog. A robot pipe. A robot pipe. You think that is Bowser's top dog. His top minion. His number one guy is a robot pipe. What if Big Bird was a Bob-omb? Could use alternate to fight. We already have a Bob-omb boss in the Bob-omb factory. So, no. Boom Boom. Boom Boom. Let's see Boom Boom. Which one's that again? Oh, this guy. He definitely looks like one of Bowser's top guys. Yeah, I agree. Kamek. Kamek doesn't seem like a strike breaker to me. Kamek is more like Bowser's assistant. Bowser's magician. Strike breaker is just gonna be like a big, fat, burly guy. What do you have in mind for one of the Bowser fights? I don't know what we have for the third Bowser fight yet. We did the first two. Come over and say that there's magic and have it fight you. No. I don't want a robot pipe. I want a big, fat dude. Who's that? Oh, from Mario World. And the issue is that I hate Mario World. So, no. If we had a big, fat dude from Yoshi's Island, that would be perfect. Wait. And I don't want the guy with the blue pants. The blue what? The guy with the blue pants. Oh. Sumo brah. Let's see that guy. Yeah, kinda. Bouldergeist. But with oil instead of a ghost. Huh. He's kinda neat, yeah. But I would absolutely love if this guy was from Yoshi's Island. So, any Yoshi's Island bosses are like an additional plus point. Oh, you guys know the Blarks from Yoshi's Island? Wait. This year? Imagine one of these made out of oil. Yeah. You can also just make up a dude exactly. But this guy out of oil? Seems pretty fun to me. Hello, creep attacks. This is not the beta block. This is completely different. It's a gargantua block. You're thinking of the shitty little hippo. Raphael the Raven. He doesn't really fit this level. What about the hook-billed Koopa? This big, fat Koopa. Doesn't really seem like a Bowser minion though, right? Or maybe. Maybe. He fits in Yoshi's Island. He is literally from Yoshi's Island. Yeah, he would kinda work. But would he be on an oil rig? Just give him a worker's helmet. But he's a strike breaker. He doesn't work with them. A strike breaker? Yeah. Maybe he's the guy who's just there for the free food. Alright, I will google Grim Leecher. And if this is not anything sensible... Oh, wait, what? What the hell is this? How do I not remember this guy? That's because he's in Yoshi's New Island. Oh, so he's not in the real game? He's in a 3DS game. So he's not in the real game. That is a real game. He's not in the real game. What do you mean by real game? It's the attack from the all black where he swallows the entire platform and you have to hide in a box or something. Oh, yeah, yeah. See, we haven't designed the area yet. So we have full reign to just design an area that fits well for the boss fight. There are many cool things we can pull off here. He's in a GBA remake. That's the one I played. I haven't seen him. Sluggy the Unshaven. That's a stupid name. Who's that? Is that the little... Yeah. Sluggy the Unshaven. But no, I think the Oil Blargg is really our play here. Because blocks are really famous in Yoshi's Island. They're everywhere. And Oil Blargg just fits so well to this level. I know what the bandits are and I don't want them here. The bandits fit better into the casino world. I prefer the GBA version because Yoshi's sounds are very cute and you can actually see the red coins. Has to be translated? Yeah. Yeah, actually, that would explain it. What about this guy from Yoshi's Island? Mr. Pipe. Make a metal? Huge metal pipe? Oh my god, that's an insane idea. Why did no one think of a huge metal pipe before? Thank you, Biobak. That is so refreshing to hear. Robot Pipe Boss, yes! I... I'm so tempted to just do it just to give that one guy a seizure. How are you gonna do the dark outlines of the block? You can use some... Inverted normals if that's what you wanted, but I don't think we even want those. Bro, I'm just looking for a texture that looks like something that would fit here. How difficult is this? It just needs to be like a little thing with an outline. We're not doing the metal pipe, guys! I was fucking around! It is gonna be the Oil Blargg, most likely. And next step is thinking about how the Oil Blargg could be a cool fight. I really like the idea of him just swallowing up platforms. And there being a little arena where you fight him in. Fucked up Yoshi for the week? Oh, that's... I can't tell how fucked up this is. He kinda has a scrotum head. Wait... Yeah... Should split up into smaller Oil Blarggs. That's an idea. Probably sending oil waves. Yeah, definitely like large waves of shit that attack you. But blocks are really just attacking like that. And how do you kill him, though? You make him swallow soap? Is soap how you get rid of oil? How do you clean oil? Soap is an insane idea. I was just thinking of like fire or like... You know, stuff like that. But soap? I don't know.        Hmm... Get a bucket of soapy water. Hmm... There's a soap that cuts through grease like nothing. I see. Yes! Yes! Dawn dish soap! What's that? The best dish soap on the planet. Okay. I did not expect to hear people enthusiastically talk about dish soap today. Real. The best tasting one? True. I remember there was a YouTuber that reviewed like different flavors of bleach at some point. He just drank straight up bleach? He just reviewed bleach. It was after that one person died from just suiciding by just drinking a bunch of bleach. That was a very edgy YouTuber. You could write on a Koopa shell, replace it with a sponge and clean him off. Oh, that could look very cinematic actually. Very silly but very fitting for Mario. Yeah. Honestly, that sounds like a shitpost idea but at the same time, I kind of like it. Every time he attacks, then you clean the leftovers of him off the arena? Hmm... Hmm... How do you usually fight a gargantua block? Let's look at a few videos. See if we have some ideas here. This doesn't look like a video of a gargantua block. What is... What the fuck? I wonder if these videos are AI generated. You could probably AI generate some Boinga videos like this and get millions of views. These sounds are so much cuter than the other game. Is that the boss you just avoided? Oh wait, it is. No, this is just the thing you avoid. I don't know if there's a boss version of it though. You can fight them but... Wait, what the fuck is this game? Is this a sheep looking? Oh god. Oh, he's also in Woolly... Oh my god, he looks terrible in Woolly World. I guess there might just be nothing else you can do in this art style. He looks like a scarf. Yeah. It's kind of neat. Maybe we should play this game at some point. Is this video in 15 FPS? Yes. I definitely have to use him. But is there like a boss fight version of him? Maybe not. Okay. There's never a boss version of him. I guess we have to completely make this up out of nowhere. This kind of reminds me of Pervert Chaos from Sonic Adventure. Fight-wise. He looks very upset, I agree. What if the little bobber guys come out of the goopy brownness? Sunshine? No. I don't want Sunshine. The oil master. I guess that's kind of what he is. Nice. You're sliding around on a sponge with Subtrang behind you as the slide across minibosses is still metal. Oh Right Mario Galaxy had enemies like that and that lava level do you fight them? It's their boss fight with them That's what I want to know There could be a small minion in a hamster ball driving the all mark from inside and every time it's smallest of blood from the Hamster balls left on the platform and you can kick it away But that's such a huge leap in lore I Feel like that's not official Mario lore and that they're controlled by something like that so if we did that we would kind of We would put our game outside of the Mario universe in a way and I don't like that That's the boss, what's the boss? Hello, say literal you have to beat him in his lava form by using a crane to cool him down with oil. I Want the player to control Mario and not a crane? It's kind of one risk when you make a game like this because we have so many options it's very tempting to You know use our custom coding instead of the Mario moveset and I think that often leads to poor ROM hack So I want to avoid that So This is where I was thinking the four underground entrances should be roughly And then we have the poser castle here What the fuck This is an i8 You can do it But it wouldn't be a nice detail when the Oil Blargg is formed and deactivates the oil effect on the water because he's the oil Oh, that's very easy to do. I was actually thinking of making it so that the oil effect around him is much stronger than everywhere else But One of our wires already model them that's from my 2dk game. What about them? You want to like seal him in oil barrels or like you want to make him swallow them This is the wrong overworld You Like the losses and you're fighting a gun to a black made of multiple blocks you defeat Well, let's still kind of ask the question of how you even Damage in but that idea is fine. Like that. That's a thing. We could implement if we wanted to So there's an option we can keep in mind Alright these workers on the ground entrances Although it should be moved a bit further back here That's a good well I Don't want them to be damaged by eating oil have anything that should make him stronger but I like biomex idea of him just like Removing the oil from everywhere else once he forms. It's very easy to do to Throw Yoshi X to break him into smaller pieces then right soap to clean them up How do you throw Yoshi X you don't have Yoshi there's no rideable Yoshi here Mario isn't really throwing X around Combat in Mario 64 is not easy because like his punches can a suck We need to think of a way to beat them like through the environment. I Really like the idea of him just like being on a soap shell soap Koopa shell stuff like that Can make for a very cinematic fight It is a big sealed barrel. He's the only damage did it through the fight and end up trapping him in a big barrel I Can kind of see it. Yeah thinking about it So be a huge wooden platform, let's say this is the wooden platform here and I'm on it Then I guess there would be like a play or different places on the arena that I wouldn't need to ground pounds I would cause cracks to appear and then Once you've ground pounded enough places a crack will open and he just slowly slides into that and then he's stuck in there forever But wouldn't that mean that he's moving around On the wooden barrel instead of on the seat Which is where you would usually expect him because usually lava blocks are in lava Water blocks are in water and the Oil Blargg needs to be in the oil That's the one thing I worry about I'll enjoy another You are a c64 ml coder no assembly only person. Okay, what's the difference between machine language in the subway? What do you think? I'm not really sure what to make of that. He's saying you just type in zeros and ones Into like a binary editor Yeah, exactly that's why I don't like it delivers As a jumping egg under the belt sometimes but this time he jumps into the barrel and gets trapped I don't want him to jump because like Just like the thing below him. No one knows what his feets are like, you know, it's kind of like the dick lit effect You can never have a dick lit jump because then everyone would see their feet No one knows what they look like I need to enable fuck on this Oh This can be setting the fuck Yeah, then this up my father would be funny yeah, I think so too I think there should be a little bit of like a guarded arena maybe we just have like things that float in the water that kind of Slightly do a barrier, you know how I'm like in Rico Harbor. There's like the yellow lines You can't go past that and then Mario's just like on a Soap shell which I'm not sure how we're gonna do that part yet And like you have to drive around on him to like clean him up Yeah Step on him while he tries to run away although that would mean that we have like a damageable face and a non-damageable face, which actually makes sense because The dope is the soap is gonna slowly shrink, right? Yeah, this is starting to work out So we have an arena that is guarded off and every now and then there's like a soap bar you get And if you're in the soap bar, you can chase him when you're in the soap bar. He runs away and When you hit him with the soap bar he like shrinks and eventually he's so small that he just dies But it would probably have to be in a separate area here How are we gonna make an area like that work in the main area If the area starts above the water and slowly lowers until it's underwater and then the boss spawns. So We'd have, let me delete this because this is definitely not gonna be here We'd have like the area here. It'd be like maybe an octagonal and then as soon as you step on it Everyone that's striking there Like runs off there's like a camera shake a cutscene the thing lowers into water. Maybe you transition the area and then you come out in like an underground thing and the platform keeps going down and Hmm yeah, yeah Maybe the minions can throw you the soap bars because you're helping them. Yeah Hmm Well after the fight the minions are supposed to be back at work so There must gonna be a block most likely that's our current idea On this random boss don't use it all the back will be dangerous and able to follow you in their old tricks Therefore it's a nice mechanic cut cut this way by using water barrels He's gonna be made out of oil and water, right? But no, I don't think we want to go the burn way Let me just imagine this area here It would have to be one of those things with like gates grates Like this so the block can actually go through the arena to attack you So when the floor opens up How does the floor open up just goes to the side When does it go into Could be back at work Battalion and bozo has given them some ridiculous tiny thing like free breakfast and since they've never seen bozo be nice to them They think it's awesome You know what? That's fair Right Okay, so we have our thing The thing opens up goes on the ground. Now. We are underground on like a great There's the block running around the block has two attacks I think one with where he just makes waves that attack you waves of oil. They like If you like poison damage One way he attacks you with his mouth. Maybe one way like shoots up from the ground Every now and then a soap bar spawns. If you don't have the soap bar, you can just go to the block and like run him over we're just gonna Make him be in pain and he's gonna shrink when you do that by like some percentage when he shrinks all the way he dies Only one question is left Where does the soap bar come from? When you make said the Bowser minions, which I kind of like So Arena Opens up he goes underground in a cutscene No enemies come with you Position to fight area There's Great Multiple grades Mario to stand on maybe they sometimes go in the lava Lark has three attacks One waves to fight Three shoot up from floor scale up Z scale down X Y and Every few seconds soap bar spawns Bar he runs away gets faster HP while hitting him he scales down and Once below in scale threshold device good fight There should be minions cleaning and you can write a soap bar before the boss fights. You can get used to the soap controls. I Mean on one end. Yes on the other hand If we allow Mario to just write a soap bar on the floor here We can't have the wave effect because the wave effect makes the dynamic collision way too complicated So that's the problem see if you work check I always spam ctrl s whenever I'm thinking so I never need to save my work on purpose Type so fast. My typing speed is roughly average It's like 85 words per minute, I think It's not that much for a gamer It's just a control. That should be fine Yeah, we should let players use the soap bar in the level though, I agree with that Let's just have this be in a level there are oil specs in the level Clean up with a soap bar for a Yoshi coin or blue coins. Kushnik And They're cleaning the bedroom, so you're riding above the water Yeah, okay, okay same idea then I just don't want the player to you know drive around on the oil here Mmm, so we need to replace some of these with soap bars So let's do at least two of them with salt bars And this one is gonna be so bar on the water, yeah Don't mission one scaffolds So All right, we're gonna move that here so far I Revisit mini-games where you clean oil piles in a closed platform. Well, that's basically what this is Get a Yoshi coin here, maybe they should even be coin trails with that. I don't know. Maybe not Maybe not I Just want him yes, you just run into him to clean them up He should look worried and like run away when you do that, so maybe we need this ice to be animatable Maybe you'll get eyelids to animate Gonna be very obvious you have no chance of seeing it after the boss you are forced To go here to do mission to to trigger mission free. So you're a hundred percent guaranteed to see this before mission free Can't believe Lilaa would call me stinky It's not true I have never smelt bad Pretend I didn't hear that I Wonder if the mouse ever got stuck in the bucket again, I would see a jump around unless it died That's a brutal we're got no net never smelled once in his life I Would never I'm not run into him with this Hope it would be cooler to surround him by surfing and force him to move into the soap track you create. I Mean it would work that would be a bit more tactical, but I think it's more fun to just like run into him I'm gonna do him with a bar of soap. Yeah, like chase him with the soap Just start with a bar of soap and chase him. Yeah, that's it. Yeah That sounds like a lot of fun I So much drinks over time news you're forced to do it three or four times I Was targeting like two for good players and three for bad players or maybe even four. So yeah roughly same idea Lilaa is redacted. I believe it I Just running into him with few can awkward what happens after when you pass through him with your bones of him your Your soap I would run out and if it runs out you're gonna take damage in the oily water You're gonna have to get back to land. I'm gonna have to return to land early. You can do either one of the two Kong I mean we can't do that, but There are silent doesn't sound very interesting what is different in the Russell and compared to Mushroom Kingdom Maybe I'm just not getting it Said if you theater bows are born in the moment. Hello James show Dude my German I think if I spoke German now, I would Just sound like a book i wouldn't sound like a normal human speaking because my vocabulary is so unusual because i barely speak german anymore and even before i moved to canada i didn't speak that much your stepdad just gave you an insane amount of food i mean is he forcing you to eat it sarasaland is basically just egypt huh that doesn't sound that exciting either the radius level that's in sarasaland oh that was like mario land hello lilliana is it no no leftover food so that's fine yes and no he's never been mad and it's leftover food and you think there's a yes and no answer to him forcing you some people can tell i'm german others have a bit of a trouble with it i guess it depends on how well you know english so holy shit fish in chat oh this could be an interesting texture choice let's try this yeah i try to not speak german on stream because if i do speak german on stream then a lot of people are not gonna send me so it feels a bit exclusionary so i love following the quads true ah bierlederhosen hitler hitler yep that's what they like to say they all just think of bayern well not to say that bayern is hitler hitler but you know bierlederhosen yeah that's bayern is this copy of photoshop legal crazy gyro are you accusing me me case of pirating software it's a hundred percent legal would i ever pirate software like come on would you download a car i would absolutely download a car if i could i live with a criminal wouldn't it be cool to have a downloaded 100 legal car i live with a criminal i do not associate if anyone at nintendo is seeing this i don't know her what's nintendo gonna do come to my house with a gun to my face it's more likely than you think yes mr emulator so this looks kind of like shit i hate it oh i did not know that i thought that was somewhere like in the middle of germany where they were getting pretty right wing nowadays i am from very northwest germany the city is called northern which just translates to north that's how far north it is so i'm from a hospital dude i was born in a hospital too crazy how that works you don't understand german politics they're not that different from actually they are very different from american ones yeah actually american ones are much more shit show not that german politics are great but they're a little better that is not how you were envisioning the area how were you envisioning it saying yoshi shooting his ex would be nice to shoot soap yeah um i don't really want to add shooting mechanics to mario 64 though i mean especially for like just a boss fight it's weird to add a whole mechanic like that i think it's not elegant i think this could work a bit better so a change that you're requesting by your back so i can say yes or no to that okay yeah i mean when would they be spawning from this texture is not even seamless dude give you a second okay one so a giant soap dispenser that shoots oil barrels at you  okay this might work out kind of visually speaking so i mean that's how i envisioned the underground area yeah but not the above ground area oh i see now i see now okay see all right all right i was thinking there was gonna be a thing like this and it's closed off and as soon as you step on there's a platform that goes underground and then underground there's this not this game here eh but the original game for sure yeah it has to be underground if it's above ground we can't have the waves right if you ever if you're ever on the waves here you're just fucked like the waves how are you gonna program that the waves move so radically it's gonna be impossible for me to actually determine where the collision is but if this is underground and this is just considered like one huge oil barrel i'm always done for the fight hmm okay but then how are the minions striking here oh i guess i guess it would work kind of i really like the idea of this being a separate area though inside an oil barrel and there's another ring here it's made to make when we get a separate area i agree but we have to make the fight work somehow and then a separate area can look so much better the issue is this area is gonna have performance problems if we put too much here i mean yes but we can't add stuff underground we could add so many things to it and also minions could throw you the soap and it wouldn't make sense well i mean actually yeah they could also throw it here still so i want this to look like a giant metal oil barrel i think this texture is not perfect for that maybe the dookie nookie texture works i don't know why i call that that so where the f**k is it i think i eats you and spits you out in a separate area oh i like that yeah yeah all right let's do that f**k it i guess it doesn't have to be underground so it has to be one of the cleaning crew guys right or how are you getting the soap how do you stay motivated i'm not motivated at all so you need to work without motivation i'm not overclocking the n64 i'm not gonna require hardware mods for my game buy soap like a normal person now you need to get soap from somewhere oh murthra and boza says he's been hunting dumping barrels of oil in the sea to feed them hey yeah i like that it's a funny idea it doesn't work for a lot of people though skill issue just work it's not that hard you're physically capable of working so why aren't you that's how i approach it monty moles gives off a gender vibes true true the problem is we need mario to have a place where soap or spawn in here somehow so it can also just be fluid like a supply pipe right i think about the idea that bozo used to throw oil barrels there to feed them there could be a pipe that usually all barrels pop out of but now soap bars do that that would require a text to explain though i wish i got airdrops into your airdrop maybe like a para cooper still that will require a text so yeah that works i just have a para cooper okay in that case we just kind of need bozo's castle here and next to bozo's castle is going to be the platform where they strike so this is going to be where they strike i guess the entrance to bozo's castle after all and then i'm thinking a little bridge here just like made out of metal so why does it look like a toilet i don't know that might be a u issue i do not see a toilet if anyone sees a toilet i think that's not on me so case toilet case i know if did it finally happen that we finally had the mandatory toilet per key sec that's a real thing people are accusing me of they're saying case you put the so so so it's not an accusation it's an observation see see what i'm talking about this is what i have to deal with what if for balsa's office here we go with like a castle design like um where is it is this what i'm thinking of there's one really cool one this one here that's what we want bowser's office with the little claws i like that what's that this is going to be bowser's castle Lilaa so so so so so so so so  whenever you sex there's e-stacks everywhere in this game thank you Lilaa so so so you Fuck, I would just like some triangles please. There we go. Definitely a blender issue. I have an oil manager office sign on it. No, it's Bowser, he's not just the oil manager, he's the big guy. He's the big boy. I think that looks good. See Sleek Steamworks? No, the rate of fill. Oh no. Surely we can optimize this a little. There, I hope you're happy. There we go. Charity Y.I. lives another day. Oozing oil ocean. Going with oil ocean is a bit too close to Sonic's level. What is the same security menu inside blender? I remember wishing something was on the console. Wait, what about oozing oil operation? Wow? Oozing oil operation. Hmm, that could work, yeah. Not entirely opposed to it. It's not a bad idea. I mean, he's trying to build, set up his next plan, so I think it's good. Yeah. Wait, someone in chat just gave the exact same name of oozing oil operation. Did they stole your idea? Who stole whose? I don't know. I didn't even notice. That name is perfect. Can't use it. Okay, sir. Okay, boss. I'm right on it. Boss. Do this as a hobby or a business? Both. It started purely as a hobby, but it slowly turned into, like, business because I started making money from it. This is a bit expensive for a detail you will barely see, but I'm sure we can do some optimization on this too. What will I do again? It doesn't matter. We don't need to do this right now. Business, Nintendo News after you? No. I mean, yes, but, like, nothing's been happening, so. Last time they took me down, I told them to fuck off, basically, and they did fuck off. I'm even, like, contesting their YouTube claims and they're putting me back online. I'm not really that worried about Nintendo anymore. How do you make money from this? YouTube ads. Ad revenue on YouTube, basically. That's the only thing you can do. I did hear what happened to Dolphin. Besides, I don't think Nintendo gives a shit whether you make money from your mods or not. That's never been a criteria. I remember before I had a Patreon, they were very aggressive towards me, and now that I have a Patreon, honestly, it's been less. Definitely don't need these black bolts here. I think this works for Bozo's office building. Maybe actually it should be a lot higher. I think it'd be cooler if this was really high. Like that. As a model myself, how the heck do you model this fast? Like normal would take me 1.5 more time for you. Just do it. Just like be a gamer. I didn't even do anything special. I just looked up the blender shortcuts list and then that was it. I just scanned them into my brain. I'm just both different. I don't know. But I get that a lot. A lot of people see me use blender. They're like, holy shit, you're so fast. What was the office concept art? I like it. Yeah. Mine is the toilet. I think I like it. Fine. You know what? This goes into this. So if you have this office here, then the office tower should be in the middle of the whole thing. Maybe slightly back. And if someone actually wanted to be faster blender, they could probably be a lot faster than me. I don't even probably even use shortcuts on a mouse or anything. I don't have that mouse. If you really wanted to go fast, you should run the shortcuts and have them on a mouse since you know, sometimes I have to take my hand off the keyboard like that and it really slows me down. I noticed that. Well, let's just fill out the main focus point is the toilet. Ah, shit. I only want the building, unfortunately. I'm really sorry about that. A wet floor caution sign. Now Bowser doesn't really deal with Osha, you know. What's a good insult for Osha? Alas, Chachabitty, give me a good line for a villain making a pun on Osha regulations that insults the Osha regulations. Shit. Let me type this GPU real quick and that's of Osha more like jumps somewhere. Osha more like overly sensitive has that apprehend us. Your regulations could stop a paper cut, let alone a real workplace accident. I love this stupid AI. Yeah, follow Osho, I'll blow your stupid head away, mwaha. Putting horns on the building. Yep, I think that was a very fun touch that Biobak had. Can I do some office decorations? Sure, what do you want to do? Maybe there's like a picture of Bowser in a suit and tie. We definitely need number one boss mug. Yeah, yeah. Maybe a picture of Bowser Jr. on his desk. I don't know if you will be seeing his desk. I don't know, maybe he has this little booth in his office. Do we get to explore the inside of the building? Yeah, you will be able to climb around in here and like see his building. At least that's the idea. Maybe we could have some Koopas in suits trying to knock on Bowser's office door like Sir, we need to stop this protest. You don't see them talk, no. Talking is too much, that's too intrusive. These things have to be like subtle and just visual, they can't be annoying. No, a picture of Peach on his desk. We could have a picture of Peach on the walls. Yeah, I'm not opposed to that. Yeah, let me just check how the size of these elements feels. Material 0042. I just wanted to have this at the top, but I thought the toilet would be funnier. I entered the wrong level. All these pipes don't work yet. This is the only pipe that works because we're still on the first level of the third overworld. Okay, yeah, the size of that seems perfect to me from here. I even kind of like how this platform looks. Mm-hmm. I don't know what that one second is. There are targets with Mario's face taped to it. Yeah, there can be a lot of easter eggs here. And the question is, how do you actually see these? Again, there's the material dab and Bowser's office. It's gonna be in the castle. But there isn't much to do in there. Mm-hmm. Definitely a Yoshi coin. This needs to be in the Bowser castle. Hmm. Now I see. We need more underwater. We can't avoid this. Yeah, okay, we have to. There just have to be two Yoshi coins and nothing else really. And this is not gonna be a metal pipe anymore. This is just gonna be a normal entrance to a castle. So there really is only two Yoshi coins in here and nothing else. That almost feels like this building is a red herring now. I don't really like it that much. Hmm. There isn't much else we can do though. Unless we remove the power generator thing and replace it for something in Bowser's castle. Or something that requires you being in both places. Which I do not like at all. When there's a whole building to be, I was just thinking a really tall tower with a desk at the top. You know what? That works too. But no, actually if it's just a really tall building with a desk at the top. Let's say. And the minions are knocking on there. How do you see Bowser at all? You just like see him from the top of the crane. And from there you can see all these easter eggs. I guess that works. But then can you go inside? What do you see inside? Just like Bowser's reception. Maybe that would be better. God damn it. You're convincing me. It should be a way to reach the top as an easter egg. Yeah. You know, I've also had the thought that it kind of sucks that this is another Bowser castle. I don't really want the whole castle. So I think I'm gonna. Go with that suggestion and just have it be a big tower. So. It's not really the shape you wanted. So. No, I entered local space. No, how do I get out? No. Sometimes you do this misclick and it does this and it's the worst thing of all time. Well, I guess that view was ruined. Let's slash above the keyboard. How did I press the button? Oh god, my view is locked. Okay, that's. Okay, we're safe. Yeah, okay. Well, unfortunately, me and Zeina, we have to go to a birthday party, to a double birthday party. And we should be there at five and I still have to shower. Because I'm not a stinky, I will shower. So we're gonna have to head out for now. Next time we're gonna continue this. I'm probably gonna finish the retro area off stream this week. I have Monday off, so I may have a lot of time to work. Yeah, that's what I do on my day off, I work. And I'll see you guys next Saturday or tomorrow for the case clips. Until then, bye bye.
