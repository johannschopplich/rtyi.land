Hello, Bingus. Hello, Mimoski. Welcome to the stream, everyone. Welcome to the stream, everyone. Welcome to the stream, everyone. So the past week, I have been working on completely remaking Mario 64's sound engine. During this stream, you might hear some sound bugs. I am still working on fixing those. But having our own custom sound engine means it will be a lot easier to fix bugs and address issues and add new things and stuff. I need to switch to this.  Definitely trippy, tropper, tropper, trippy. It's not even close. Hello, Sam Memory. I can't wait for the next demo. I don't think there will be another demo. The next release will be the full game. Anyway, the sound engine rework. The sound engine is now around 80% faster than vanilla sound engine. The code is around a quarter of the size. We need much less memory. And we support 32 notes instead of 16. So now songs can be much more complex and it's not even more expensive. Yep, 80%. I kind of want this to be underwater so that the whole thing doesn't suck to walk through. Check out the remake, Buzzer. It's pretty fun and challenging. I've seen what it is, but I haven't played it. I still got a little bit of sound stuff to do. Ideally, once I'm done with it, it will allow us to add a lot more sound effects. Because in vanilla Marv64, if you try to add sound effects, it doesn't really work. And I never knew why. And I still don't know why, but I'm sure that my rework doesn't have that issue anymore. Yes, everything you see right now is placeholder. As we try to figure out the best way to do this overworld. Well, originally I didn't even make this mod for the optimization. The optimization just kind of happened because I felt too limited by the hardware. I don't know, it's kind of weird to me that this whole project became so much about optimization in the public eye. But I guess it was bound to happen. That's just what did well on YouTube, and that's why I kept engaging with that. What's L-Ultra doing? Why don't you ask me? Why don't you ask L-Ultra? It's kind of rude to talk about people right in front of them, no? I would like to apologize to L-Ultra for Lila's rudeness. Usually Lila behaves herself a little more. We keep her around. She's like the resident stream pet. Any LST wishes today? People got Kase streaming again? Hello. Or is calling me a pet? I've done worse. I don't know why you're getting upset. What are your plans for this level? Any new mechanics? This is the overworld, and yes, there's tons of new mechanics. Because it's the overworld. This is the biggest level ever. This level will have like 30 stars or something like that. Is L-Ultra new here or not? I don't know. Origami King LST? I need better access to my water. I think L-Ultra is pretty new here. The idea of a human calling themselves new is funny to me. That's true, Alex. I can definitely see it. We have a bit of a problem here. Bells Astral is going to be here. The Yoshi Village is going to be over here. There needs to be a good bit of space between them. Otherwise, it feels weird, I think. But also, we don't want a lot of empty space. So we need to do something. How's Draco's Mario coming? Draco's Mario is finished. I am just waiting for the commissioner to tell me that he also thinks it's finished. So I can release it. L-Ultra again. Lutra? Is your name Lutra? You must consider, I have heard about the Ultra 64 for so long. That that just seems like a normal word to me. Lutra does not seem like a name to me. Never heard of anyone called Lutra. Not L-Ultra. L-Ultra! Lip-Ultra, true. Lip-Ultra too. Some small boats with Yoshis in them.  Okay, I think what we do is we put a bunch of trees here with hammocks in them. And that's going to kind of separate the Bowser section here. Lutra is the genus of European otter. What the hell? How would I know that? Cases of fake European, true. I mean, I live in Canada now, so... I hope I never have to move to an EU country again. You know what I kind of don't like in video games? The fact that you spend the whole video game saving the world. But then once you save the world, you're not allowed to explore the saved world. The game is just like, yeah, let's go back to the save. And before you save the world. I think I want to change that. I don't know.  I want the player to save the world and then be like, yep, this is the world now. You saved it. Look at that. Does this make this any better? I would assume not. But let's see. Seattle girlies. Seattle girlies. So this is going to be Moshi's target practice. There isn't much here. That's going to be the entrance to the Bowser level. I kind of need this to be off to the side. We can put a few hammocks between here. Maybe let Mario climb on the trees. But this is still large and empty. And it sucks. I think maybe it would be better if I actually had some proper mountain region here. Like if we said, okay, everything to the left of here is going to be mountainous. I think that's the way to go. I actually want this to be in this line here. Do you have a sketch of the old or have you just been making as you go? I have a sketch of it. I just haven't opened it on stream in a while because we already know what it's going to look like. I always sketch my level first, I guess. Okay, the coloring doesn't matter. The coloring means nothing right now. It's not supposed to be text. It's just... But yeah, I think it would be extremely cool if in this game, for a change, after you save the world, it doesn't reset your save file. It's just you are in the world and the world is saved. And now you're free to do whatever you want. That's kind of cool looking. I kind of like this. So what music is saying? I have to open a music I've never made that's such a bop. But I do made around 12 OVALT songs. And this is the current version that 0VALT is working on right now. Sounds like this. This is just one of like 15 songs. The song is going to fade whenever you walk to a different area. So the OVALT is going to be insanely full and sprawling with music. The one you're thinking of, I think it's just one of the many. I'm not sure if that's still in there. Is this streamed? It's not. It's a midi song. But do use the secret technique on this one. Lila is not asking if the stream is streamed. She's asking if the song is streamed. But honestly, I shouldn't have corrected you guys. Lila being made fun of is much funnier. Especially when it's unjust. Will there be a snowy mountain peak? Yes, actually. There is a whole level like that. Although you're spending most of the time inside the castle on the mountain. What's Mario's voice sound like in German, I bet he said, it is me, Mario, in a really formal way. Es ist ich, Mario. It's not insulting your social life. That's the sound that plays when you think about Lila's social life. I didn't say shit about you, Lila.  Okay, my hair won't look even better if you delete everything and replace it with a low-quality image of French toast. I'll consider it. Why are you touching up the mesh so much? And what the fuck do you think I'm doing? Are you just here to drive me insane? Is that the goal? So, I think we're gonna have the guy that has this flower garden right here. It still looks so big, holy shit. Yeah, this just feels wrong. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. It will be something like this. Let's take a look at the skill fields right now. I played WarioWare for Game Boy recently for the first time and it was a banger. But do you have 1, 2 and 3 bounce on blender? I don't. Okay, I think the trees here are fine. I think the walk over to Bowser's area is fine, too. This could be fine. This still feels big and flat. I guess this is a little Yoshi mountain village and the Yoshis have two villages on this island. Um, I don't know which one I played. I played the one that's on an NSO. Biobak is making a lot of custom textures but not literally every texture is custom. However, in the end I probably will have to make every texture custom. For the reason that if I want this to all be legal, I would technically need custom textures for everything. But that's something for later if I actually do want to make this a legal game or something. Then I'll get a bunch of texture artists to help with that. I don't think it will be that much work because a lot of them are already custom. Okay. Okay. Okay. Streamer, are you watching? I'm not watching the streamer. So we're seeing how far the thanks comes in since I'm watching the streams that I won back in high school when you started working on the tree level. The tree level? Oh, is that course 10? Oh my god. That's like, that's beyond halfway through development. But it doesn't feel weird to think that, you know, I might be done developing this like eventually. But so far I've always finished my hacks. So I'm very confident this one is going to get done soon. Are there any mechanic-based minigames left to decide? No, not really. I mean, if you have any good ideas, we can maybe do it, but... Dude, this is actually right up my alley because I spent the last week analyzing the Mario 64 sound engine and rewriting it. Diddy Kong Racing. Oh wait, this is Hackamari64. Hackamari64 is fucked, just so you know. I've heard the sound before. This happened in Portal Mario. Um... Red coins used to synthetically generate waves at runtime. Does this happen again? It should happen on every red coin now, right? Does he collect another? No, that one sounded normal. Why was the other one... Honestly, I'm not sure. I have removed synthetic waves from my engine a long time ago. I would imagine that's something that went wrong with that. The red coins are the only ones using the synth waves. So I bet that's related. Hackamari64 is by Rione. Hackamari64 is a group effort, it is not just by Rione. So yeah, at first I thought the Hackamari64 project was cool. But I became a hater over time because they kept making really weird decisions. And then they kept complaining that they can't have my code because my code is too difficult to understand or debug or something, which I think made no sense. And now I'm a bit of a hater. What's fucked about it? They're missing all the optimizations, even when I publish them. They just have some weird decisions. What's the goal of it? I don't think they have a goal that they actually pursue. I think they just do things. If the goal was to have a repository that's keeping vanilla parity and is good for ROM hacking. Well, they haven't kept vanilla parity because you boot the game and the camera is fucked. Because the camera doesn't look like the vanilla camera at all. If the goal is to make the thing that's most usable to make ROM hacks with, I think they haven't achieved that either. Because there's many features that they don't add because they want to keep vanilla parity. How do you still find the time to work so hard on this game and be in your job and your wife and your other commitments? This is some insane work. Honestly, it's not that hard to find time for this stuff. If you think about your day-to-day, I'm sure you'll find that you waste most of your free time. And that's why you don't have time to do stuff like this. That's not meant as a front. I know it sounded like a front, but this is just something general about humans. Nope, I'm literally just a normal programmer at my day job. Not even a senior developer or anything like that. I could really use more money though. Why are you talking about TD Bank? Oh yeah, new video tomorrow. I know the videos are coming fast recently. It is because I find sponsors and sponsors make videos for us and will pay you a lot of money. So I'm like, okay, I'll make the video. I want the money. I gotta find a way to record footage faster though. It always takes me so long to record all the stuff for the videos. I have to work almost like two days to make a video. And that is with an editor. Okay, this scale seems a lot more reasonable for a mountain town already. It's just scaled 20% down. Hitting balls in a jar. Is this a ligma? Isn't it a little bit crowder? What does crowder mean? Oh yeah, I would like the videos we're making too. There's multiple paths up already. So we were gonna add a wool warehouse. And I think the best place for the warehouse is to go here. Is there any overworld music? It's not imported yet, but there's 12 different songs for this overworld so far. Or 8 or 9 or 10 or 13. A lot for sure. Hello, Biobak. Mario. I'm just now thinking about putting the wheel warehouse here at the wool. It's gonna be Boshi's target practice. This is going to be the mountain Yoshi village. And then this is the fargrass area where I don't know what to do with yet. We have a flower farm. Treehouses, right. I need treehouses, but that's going in this area. I think the wool building works well here. And boats can be anywhere. Boshi and Marca... Wait, Boshi and Marca, we? I have not. What is that? Boshi and Marca. Is it special? This? Marca the world. There's no way, dude. No, this sucks. Oh, that's cool, though. Where is... I'm not clicking on that. That's cool that he's in Mario Kart World, but it sucks that Mario Kart World is also called MKW. Not a fan of that. They should change the name to accommodate me. It should be illegal to release two games with the same acronym. Someone start a petition. Stop killing acronyms. Guys, what's stop killing games? Is it based or cringe? Because someone pinged me about it on Twitter and I don't know if it's based or cringe. I just know there was some controversy with it. I don't want any explanation about it, I just want to paste or cringe both, dang. Good old moral ambiguity, moral greyness. Pasted in theory and cringed in practice, I see, I see. Based in theory and cringed in practice, that sounds like fucking Jordan Peterson talking about communism. Let's make this stream not a politics stream though, I realize that we've had a lot of that recently and I think it's not what people desire when they come here. The sex milking factory. I set up my fish pond yesterday, now we have 10 goldfish in there. And I hope the birds don't come and eat my fish friends. He co-created a milking fetish video saying this is what they are doing to young boys in China. I don't think this is true for everyone, Moe. I don't think you could bring up me and talk about some insane shit I didn't know. Actually you can, nevermind. I have done plenty of insane shit in the past. Another thing about hacker is that they use the boltrap but they use the binary inclusion of the boltrap, so now you have a big blob of code that you can't edit. Like come on, that is fucked. And then after doing that, saying that my code is hard to edit, then it shouldn't be in. Come on. The hypocrisy. There is plenty of unnecessary triangles in here. We are keeping a lot of unnecessary triangles around so we can edit this level more in the  future. I think this part looks nice now, mostly, kind of. Should we maybe like pull this in a little bit so that this feels more out of sight? Honestly yes, that's a great idea. We want this to be somewhat out of sight from the Yoshi village. I think that's nice. I'm not ragebaiting you. You genuinely can't edit the boltrap in hacker. It's true. You just have a big binary blob that you're gonna have to replace if you ever wanna change the OS functions, which of course most people don't do. But it's still like giga annoying if you do wanna do it. Very sharp corner? I don't think so. Seems reasonable to me. A Yoshi Moai statue would be great. Okay, guys, I have a question for you. So, you need to help me with the thumbnail and the video. The next video is going to be about RNG in Mario 64 and how to improve it. This is a thumbnail idea. And then I have this thumbnail idea, but I don't like it as much as this one. And also this, and I don't really like it. Yeah, and then the title, the title ideas I have is randomness is not random and how I fixed it. I kinda don't like it. Perfecting random number generation in brackets on the Nintendo 64, I kinda like that. The issue with randomness, very vague posting, but eh. And then the last is the perfect random function in brackets for the N64, question mark. Because we wanna put hammocks between them either. Change the nice color, it should be more orangey.  Wait, Brandon said I didn't put the tree line in the clip looking a bit offset backwards a little bit to give parallax effect. Ew, it's 3D, there's no parallax effect. Yeah, I just copy pasted your text and put it in Zane's DMs. But it's not the worst RNG in R64, huh? Orangey. What's the joke? Is there some kind of orangey thing I did that I don't remember? Videos about orangey, oh, who would understand that? I will delete that message. Kalian, what's the joke? Anyway, we need a wool warehouse. What would a wool warehouse look like? Wait, is this wool? I thought wool was like from sheep. I don't see how a randomizer would be fun for this game. That is yarn, yeah. Did we give it a name, the store? Is it gonna be a store? What is it gonna be? Maybe it should just be a Yoshi just storing wool in a place in his house. What if there's just a house and the house is full of wool? And then you talk to the Yoshi and the Yoshi is like, I'm saving wool. No. It's gonna be like a light reference. He's just saying he's gonna save up the wool because he's wanting to craft something. What's the joke?  Oh no, not this unfunny Vega shit, please. Being around unfunny people is some kind of divine punishment. This is a wooly warehouse. Yeah, I don't think we're gonna give it a name at all actually. Because it doesn't really serve a purpose, right? I think we're just gonna have this be a throwaway gag. You can do anything you want, it's real. Did you guys know that you can program Tetris? In Mario 64's music format. As in, the entire game of Tetris is literally a valid MIDI sequence in Mario 64. Let me see if I can find this. Yep, I have the file. DeathWizard made this. This music sequence is literally Tetris. Which version of Tetris? Whichever one DeathWizard made. Imagine downloading the music sequence from Super Mario World Central, putting it into your ROM Mac, and then it's just fucking Tetris. Drinks no mercy, do me a favor and you can have Mario fight Ace of Diamonds in Luigi's Pokédex for the thumbnail. Hmm. Well, that's not really what the video is about, so. For that reason, I don't think that's a great idea. The video is about, like, finding a new RNG algorithm that uses real-world entropy as well. I kind of prefer the bigger Yoshi houses. They're much nicer than the smaller ones we had before. But I think we probably need a redesign of these houses. They look a little poopy. I export it and then I compile the game. But the Yoshi village does feel like a decent-sized overworld now. And then this is the part with the entrance to the last Bowser level, where you need enough magic to get through. And this is a little bit of a walk, but I think that's fine. It sounds like you had a terrible setup, Ether Egg. Can you use the temperature thing to randomize the randomness even more? I do. That's how I discovered the temperature thing. Because I just did a thing and then I realized, hey, wait. This is actually using real-world entropy. Maybe even temperature wouldn't matter. All right. Now that we have this done, it is time to go back to the first overworld and make this look semi-decent. Not on Coyote. It is not Easter yet. Coyotey, not Coyote. I keep forgetting. All right. First of all, oops. This dirt wall here. So we do need there to be a dirt wall a little bit. So it makes sense that this is the bunny barrel. But I don't know if we need such a big dirt wall. Pile of dirt next to a mountain. Does this exist in the real world? Not really. Got a lot in ethic. Yeah, but this looks so man-made. Yeah, I've done that before. I've made a rome called Super Mario Bros. 64. And you can play as Luigi, Mario, Wario, or Waluigi. And each plumber has a different difficulty. Where do these caves come from? I'm just going to switch out in the overworld. Yeah, almost like I didn't actually UV map anything yet. And like I haven't actually done any visuals yet. That's crazy. I wonder why. This is kind of nice. Maybe we should go for this type of level. Block. Maybe I shouldn't punch outwards but rather inwards. Maybe I shouldn't punch outwards but rather inwards. Maybe I shouldn't punch outwards but rather inwards. Like so I guess. Maybe I shouldn't punch outwards but rather inwards. Keaton, how long have you been SMC's Maraad King? Sorry if you've answered this question a billion times. Uh like 2011 I guess. All right let's make a wall texture. Wait, shit before we can move on I kind of need to finish the mountains. As in give the mountains like a mountain roof or something. Just so we know what they're supposed to look like in the end. How would this best work? How does the mountain look like here? Like this. It's like a normal mountain and then a transition and then that mountain. That's kind of cool looking. I think we should do something kind of like it. Yeah like this here is cool. This mountain texture is a lot better already. We should probably use something like this here more. So So So Kind of like that. So Okay it's not gonna work like that. So Could you imagine people like joining a Bob Ross stream and like complaining that he's not done yet like the whole time. So I can't imagine it very well. I don't need much imagination for that. So Complaining about Bob Ross not reading chat. True very very true. So Okay the mountain kind of like that works for me. Then there is a mountain around here. Oh that's a jank-ass mountain what the hell. Wait this is not a full mountain. Oh no this is an issue. What the fuck is this? This geometry makes no sense. Shit  Like how would this ever work out? It just doesn't. Right So Would have to be all of that all of that and then. I guess there can be like a second level of mountain here like so. And now it kind of makes sense. When does my next painting release? Yo bum we've been waiting forever when's the next painting? So So Any enemies that didn't make the cut for R2-D2? Oh yeah plenty. Hello again Caleb. So I don't actually know if I use more enemies than actually I have to use more enemies than vanilla game right? We made so many custom ones. So So So You are bored? Well go work on a romeg. Don't like how the walls of trees are in line with the cliffs or whatever? Yep that's because this is not the final version. This obviously looks like garbage. You're not supposed to like it. At least not yet. If you think this is good you're just wrong. We're still on the stage where we're making a lot of rapid changes. So finalizing any visuals right now would be very stupid. Be a waste of time. Oh this is unnecessary. And this is unnecessary. You know just like 5 minutes ago we were talking about people joining Rob Ross's chat to complain that he's not done with the painting yet. What you did just now is kinda bad. You triangulate all the faces at the end to avoid pain? On Xport it is all being triangulated. In Mario 64 you don't really render. Actually I mean you do render triangles. But you don't really... Don't worry about it. What do you say about this game? Is it at least going to release in this year? No I don't. It's gonna come when it's gonna come. I'm not gonna give release dates until I know what the release date is. And I don't. The thing is I can't release this around the same time as Nintendo releases anything. And I also can't announce a release date around the same time Nintendo releases anything. Because if I do they will literally kill me. So if I release this I have to find a period of time where Nintendo is not dropping any big announcement or releases. And that is for sure not right now. June 5th 2025. Late 25 or early 26. I'm not saying any of that stuff. There's still so many levels for Biobak to rework. This reminds me of one comment I got on YouTube in a weird way. Or like an email. They wrote me an email. And from the way the email was written you could tell that they thought all my videos were fanfiction. Like the same way analog horror is like people making up stories. Or like Ben Drowned is someone making up a story. They thought all my optimizations was just me making up technology. Yo Gaio. Yo Gaio. The optimizations are in fact real. This guy. The email he wrote me was like hey you should make a video about an optimization that works like this. And it's like that's not how any optimization works. They had just made one up because they thought it sounded cool. It's a mirrorless camera right? If you like you can buy me a webcam. You should optimize your viewers. I don't want to live my life like that. In what part of the world is this? Part 12. I'm going to read about how Marzmell makes the game run better. True. It has to be like a funny troll idea for April 1st like that. Look guys I unstretched the UVs. Isn't that amazing? Alright so only two mountainous areas remain. Well kinda only one. And it's this big one here. With the volcano. This one is tough to work with. Holy shit. I don't think I ever commented that Oh, the most critical one I mean the YouTube commentary one I don't want to name any names I want to start a beef here actually you know what if I had beef with most critical that would go hard I would become so famous but I don't think I want beef with them I think I would probably like him I just see this videos it's really funny how case is afraid to realize I am afraid to realize the markets your internet is optimized question mark would be possible make it have 3d characters and 60fps 3d characters is going to be very tough if you want them to look decent 60fps and single-player for sure see he makes a parody of my videos and that no but yes that would be funny you make an account called dry accepting and if the exact opposite is an opinion of what he does okay the direct opposite opinion of what he does is like see his opinion is like you take the most popular opinion on the topic or like you take all the opinions on a topic and average them out the opposite of that would be like both extreme opinions at the same time so like Twitter exactly likes better you've ever seen like the Nazi fanboys like that that would be like the opposite of most critical opinion Nazi fanboys the content cop situation is rather unremarkable in the last couple years yeah that's like a moist critical opposite very Nazi fanboys very Nazi fanboys truly truly sounds insane there has to be like an element of role-playing to it right like most of them aren't serious they just role-playing and they don't realize some people are serious about it right how old are you 30 29 actually you need your text to strum do you make them yourself and mix up all of it this is true that I don't know what the hell is going on chats are pissed because the videos on the land restaurant are you talking about oh we're out of music are you talking about content cop he's gonna get the Knights no oh don't kill that's like four years of history in German history class all you really learn about is how bad it was that's like all we the way you're taught the subject is actually insane I think when he added huh I am confused yeah that seems pretty accurate you had fucking nuclear bombs at that point it was GG no German propaganda right now is very anti-german as in like almost like Germany is real evil and we need to make up to the world what we've done to them at least that's how it was when I was in school no Bismarck a frantic debate in Germany there's a statue of Bismarck in my hometown but I don't know who it is it is still like that that's what I thought we need new OST any wishes for today we did stunt both world wars that's what you learn in school I mean that's probably true I'm not saying oh you learn it in school that's why it's not true I'm saying history is always written by the winner if I read anything in history I automatically do not really believe it okay wait that's that's wrong of course I believe most of it but I'm guessing it's mixed in with a lot of propaganda Super Paper Mario okay that's a Super Paper Mario I think actually I have a good point to illustrate that is I don't think like in American school you learn a lot of like what Americans did to the Indians right even though it's obviously very bad that everyone knows that because like history is written by the winners oh really okay no maybe I'm wrong Holly especially the math that's cause my realization it's extremely downplayed what now I hear two complete opposite opinions they made a big meal with the Indians that taught them the secrets and offered their land yeah and then they called it Thanksgiving because everyone was so nice and friendly to each other and we still celebrate that until today I didn't see it oh Zelda want one all right Zelda let's do this one see how you think you're so ladybug on my screen who let a lady in my house I'm sorry I mean when I want to be sure I'm talking like we were the losers wait what oh I see I think anyway I think maybe maybe a better way to say what I believe is something along the lines of anytime there is people in power that have an interest in rewriting history they are going to rewrite history so maybe don't trust too much or assume for truth what an institution backed by a all right so I think we have the basic mountains done now well all right we need to go back to exporting area one into castle grounds and then we can start making the textures all right there we go very nice it is a problem that I can just see and actually no it's not that's fine it's fine it's perfectly fine it is supposed to be like that it's still working on fine yeah I think that's the standard working sound anyway I think a cool way to make these look is to have like a little bit of plant material on it oh by the way I noticed what the issue with the coin salt here was it's whenever the Goomba bunnies jump all sound sees look at this this is what the bug is people complained about this in the demo okay that's that's a different problem I can't figure it out don't worry do I like that some of these walls are not perfectly even do we make this a material I kind of don't like that these walls are not perfectly even but this part looks very cool actually it's just that this part doesn't look good or it looks exhausting to deal with the little ledge here is great actually I think I'm with the ledge everywhere what if I turn this and then make this go in here doesn't really work I think we need to delete this fully and do something else entirely maybe that can be something wooden here something man-made oh Oh Yeah, that looks so much better Instantly Hmm, now what to put here? Big boulder? I kinda like big boulder yeah I'm not hating it right now I think it can work now for this material we need to do something else entirely actually let's just create this on top of the old material that will make my life easier did my stream chat die or did y'all just stop typing 13 minutes ago and I scrolled up I my stream chat hung oh my god I was so much scrolled up I completely missed chat for 30 minutes cool what is my thought about lettuce as in a ladder to climb on they're pretty practical do I think letters are a good idea for r64 no because any how long was it between you meeting Zena and moving to Canada as I'm also in a long distribution so it'd be nice to know okay before I answer that you have to know I am completely reckless I just do what I feel like without thinking about it much I think we first started talking like early 2020 and then I moved to Canada in November 2021 maybe it was shorter she came to Germany around like a year after we started talking I mean I don't know if that's generally applicable I don't know I've never been in the situation where I had no direction in life I'm visiting before I move yeah I hate traveling so we made her visits and stats and then I moved right away without ever visiting when I got all these textures video games my thick Canadian accents yes of course I have a Canadian accent not a German one I'm American she's Australian I'm not making an Australian come to America I see I see I don't know do you even have the means to just move to Australia because I mean yeah I guess there isn't like if if you're with her and you can tell that it's working out like fuck it just moved there I guess what's the holdup getting a visa for residency in this fuck-ass country as hell are you trying to get the visa so you can stay there for a little bit yeah dude imagine if England was still in the EU your life would be so easy you actually got ruined by Brexit oh my god residency visa means you don't have to leave oh I see it's called a residency permit here so I have a permanent residency permit and in two months I can take the citizenship test and then I will be a Canadian citizen if I pass the English tracking themselves on breaks was so funny little did I know we're just gonna have to marry her and yeah I also just went to Canada and married Zaynab it was just easier that way this is this is inappropriate but like never mind no I think this is from a Texas city I found on our country home called 1070 at the attack just true and we would I think but then I would know she's the woman I want to spend my life with I see I don't know I wasn't scared about moving to Canada I'm my synapses just fire differently I guess homemade was just like yeah I guess that's what I'll do like that's clearly the optimal decision I'll just do that throw the cliffhanger okay fine fine it was like you were saying oh it's so hard to get a permit to move to Brexit and my question was gonna be really how brown are you just like I imagine that's gonna be it right because that's what Brexit was all about there then there was the cliffhanger never flown before dang but yeah actually how are you gonna be able to move to England unless you like marry her she wants you to do a domestic flight before your visit your sister is hysteric for no reason the domestic flight is not different from an international one imagine the English don't like the French all right I had not considered that but yes there is a whole thing there so the second is only to fly with someone before I find my own no it's nonsense flying is not different from getting in a bus you just get to get in a bus okay well it's slightly different but like not that different you've ever driven a bus before congrats you are also capable of flying oh that sucks but I like but it's also very funny I'm scared to do anything I have severe anxiety well that's a wrong approach why are you thinking about how you're going to be anxious just think about what the correct thing to do is and then turn off and just do it you know just fucking stop thinking about it that's what I do spin grados stood got a flown one minor arm is infertile edict I don't get it what is this allegedly the Canadian accent is when people say a and a boot but no one says a boot I've never met anyone who says a boot but there is this one youtuber who is like guys I'm Canadian and I'm gonna explain Canada you and he says a boot every single time and I look at that and like this guy is trying so hard to look Canadian it is so god-awful to listen to all right keep them good to Canadian Mexican yeah wow this looks so bad I need the UV mapping plugin that Biobak sent me a couple days ago Are you gonna say sorry in your experience? sorry no sorry about that no what you know what Canadians do love to say and they love to say hello how are you I'm good how are you yep I just found it on RDMS wait drag-and-drop into blender what that didn't work YouTube oh I see how do you install this use the install drop down menu drop right and drag-and-drop an extension .zip package really huh edit preferences add-on install that's what I did I'm just not sure which one of these files I need to install maybe in it I know I can just drop it into the extensions folder I will just do that this is nonsense I tried to learn a new skill but it didn't work so now I will do it my boomer way my boomer way requires a restart is it fun I couldn't pick the zip file on the install button I want to tell you I'm not gonna get locked into a fire organization about Trump how does the straight functionality work what if I click these and it's straight whoops okay okay okay got this oh I have to do something about this it's gonna be unworkable what the hell a step part I don't know don't care right now all right moment of truth does it work multiple edge loops we're doing unwrapped from around this but we're in the photo Unwrap usually doesn't really do a difference here I need to also remove this still multiple edge loops I see this would also be an issue you need to select the whole thing first how does it know which edge I wanna straight along if I did that yeah, see, it only selects one side here still multiple edge loops what about just the lower half here? or the upper half? ok, ok, ok, ok alright ok, that's where the limit is hmm do you load each column of the map by itself? yeah, that's what I thought what if I do this? wait, yes clear sharp clear seam it added the seam back ok didn't add a seam back this time I think now it's solvable though yeah look at that should I do the same when I have too many friends on twitter? oh I don't really use twitter or bluesky or whatever see, the thing is, I used twitter back when just to like post whatever the fuck I was on my mind when I felt like it and then my twitter got so famous that I'm no longer feeling comfortable to do so because now I have too many eyes looking and I can't just post insane shit so I switched to posting insane shit on linkedin so now I have my 3 linkedin fans reading my stupid insane stuff hmm bluesky's twitter without the toxicity? just give it a few days a few months miworse was great if I post it and people like me less for it, it's gonna reduce my income, you know I make a blueprint in photoshop usually a very crude drawing you know people can just AI you into saying yeah that's actually going to be so crazy once AI is good enough that you can deepfake anything it also gives you plausible deniability for anyone recording you doing something awful you could literally spit on a homeless person and be like yep that's AI I didn't do that then again people believed literal screenshots of a conversation to be irrefutable proof with many other accusations online before so maybe people will also believe every AI generated video of people doing awful stuff before that's not what I would call cool maybe cool is the wrong word you'd have to have multiple POVs to prove it? ok but you can also AI generate it from multiple points of view alright I think I need to generate a texture myself something like this is what I'm looking for actually that looks terrible I think maybe this is not what we want for Yoshi's Island they're probably going to stop trying to use AI to fake evidence in court true I don't know fuck you sorry that's rude I want to eat a Kinder Egg you ever get that? you just sit somewhere and you're like I want to eat this and then you don't have it available to you and you're just sad oh yeah it's a super high-res wall I think this could be a decent looking wall texture there's potential here that's not what I'm looking for that's not what I'm looking for that's not what I'm looking for that's not what I'm looking for that's not what I'm looking for that's not what I'm looking for that's not what I'm looking for I blame Leela that's not what I'm looking for that's nice I like this a lot what do you think? that's satisfying I'm going to stop trying to use AI to fake evidence in court  Hell yeah, hell yeah Doesn't look repetitive at all either This is a big improvement, the alt texture was never there Let's try to get something going for the scent They're trying to keep you gooning dude On Instagram, when I see a woman account, I instantly blog it at this point Because I know that if I look at women on Instagram, I'm going to get like a million porn I don't hate women, it's just, looking at anything a woman did on Instagram is dangerous Because if you do, you're going to get a bunch of porn And I don't want to get a bunch of porn The algorithm knows each person's fetish, interesting Okay, if the algorithm knows my fetish, then how come every time I google for a Mario character, I get Yoshi, inflation and feet I feel like the algorithm doesn't know me very well It knows, it knows, it knows, no! Fright predicted this Fright is all about wanting to do your parents, not fictional characters Oh, it's predicting, I see There's a lot of nice wavy scent patterns here, and I think we want one of those But multi-textured was something that's less wavy, more noisy Are you going to add floating platforms? Why? How did you start learning code when you were a baby noob? I never learned to code, I was just born with the ability to code And people don't believe me when I say this But it is true. Okay, we have a problem with I4 and that is that the range of it is kind of poopy. So what if we could rescale the range somehow? What if this is in the uv editor sidebar, uni-v. Edit the color curve in photoshop. There's a guy attracted to the fire spinnable, that is fucking weird. The problem is not the color curve, the problem is that I4 has very coarse colors and if you look at something like this, all this detail is going to be lost to quantization. So yes, I can edit the color curves but there's still the detail is going to be gone unless I somehow rescale this in the combiner, which I'm not sure how I would even achieve that.  you can definitely rescale the range. You can for example multiply it by 0.5 and then add 0.5. Now you've rescaled the stinch from 0 to 100 to 50 to 100, so you have twice as much precision in that extra 50 range. So the way I'm thinking of doing it is if I subtract primitive color or maybe if I add primitive color and then multiply it with something it works. The extra bright combiner. Not sure I remember that to be honest. Can I optimize your fucking life? No, that's up to you. What if. Okay, I have an idea. Texture 0 alpha here. That's the sand one. Never mind, that doesn't work. Texture 1 color. Minus combine color. Texture 1 is lerping between 1 and primitive color. Primitive color becomes. Are we still subtracting it? We are. All right, we're subtracting color 1, so we want this to be like orangey. And then grass testy is gonna become a different texture. Much more contrast. Let's fix your icon, you're gonna lose the detail anyway. No, the detail is all there now. This way, instead of like a lot of coarseness on the small range, we have the coarseness on a small, on a much much bigger range, right? The opposite. So. Something like this is what I'm gonna do. So. This is supposed to disappear entirely at one. Okay, yeah, now it's entirely gone. You see how the detail is now all there? But we can control like how much of it shows up.  Yeah, it looks terrible though. But I think something like this could work. Ehh yeahh yeahh sure sure awful. Asher comes in here and says, yeah yeah sure sure awful. A round of applause for him. You can also have a load between nth and prim. And then, then, then... How is it still looking like this, what? I do think the texture is just awful and we need a different one. Pizza sand, are you looking for a better sand texture? I'm looking for a sand combiner. It's kind of not a thing you can just solve with a texture, it's the problem. Did you, did you clip me saying the thing just now, is that the clip? Okay, this sand is terrible. Um, what if we just do something more normal? I can't just not have any detail here, the texture is way too big for that. But every time I add detail, it just looks so terrible. Like fuck. Tough to get right. Now it's glowing again. Maybe this combiner isn't the right choice. Maybe it's this texture here. How calm looking. There's no Photoshop, I don't know. Is Photoshop. This is kind of not awful and I would kind of like this to be on top of the normal one. So what if we did something like this? And now my texture is invisible. What the hell? What? Oh wait, my textures aren't worth it. This is what I wanted. There we go. Oh yeah, this is way better. This gives me the control I wanted. Should this maybe be scaled a bit smaller? There we go. Disclaimer, not final product. Okay, this is very cool and there's actually something else we can do to this combiner. And let's multiply with shade color alpha here. And then what we can do is multiply alpha with this. And this allows us to add more or less detail on places. For example, if we wanted this to look cornier, we could do that. Or if we wanted something to look smoother, we could do it. Like this, for example, I think it should look way more like that. Same here. Same here. And maybe we want the hill to look smoother. Let's see if that feels right. Of course. Shoutouts to Leela. Every time that error message happens after doing a multitexture, that's Leela's fault. You can switch to watching the YouTube stream when the ads play, then go back to switch when they're over. I think the scent looks pretty nice. What do you think? And then here the scent is nice and smooth. And here it's very grainy. It's kind of a cool effect. What do you mean, what just happened? What just happened?  Are you surprised that the scent looks good? Colors on the emulator inverted randomly? Oh. Fuck you, Aza, this is how I will release it. And I will make you play it. Okay, what texture do we try next? I kind of want to do the boxes and I kind of want to do the pier. Isn't it crazy that people were saying the over looked good before and now look at this. It actually looks like semi-decent now. All we did was add two textures. It's still complete garbage. The contrast between sand and water isn't enjoying. Why? I thought it was nice. Anyway, the next thing we should do is these here and the water. But to be honest, I'm done with this stream for today. I really want to finish my sound allocation today and maybe tomorrow I can finish my sound DMA and then my sound stuff is finally done. After all that work. I'll see you guys next stream. Bye bye.
