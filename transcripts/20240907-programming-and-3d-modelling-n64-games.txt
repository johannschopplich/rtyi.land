You you Something that seems a little more reasonable And then it just needs wings Making out a perfect grid it was a perfect grid Leela Hello skyloft I Think I said miss Pregler. They are separate aren't they? I Am thinking we could go in half a black light Like so But I think this is worse, but I'm not sure actually I kind of like it But cheap people over for some reason this is one of the enemies from Mario Land 1 I Don't know how to build anything in Minecraft what You're just giving me workarounds that are more work than just doing the work I Think it's decent I Actually do want to play Minecraft at some point I just don't want to pay for Minecraft Which is a bit of an issue because you can't play for free I Let's make the wing And this should probably also just be like like Just because if it isn't then it looks like there's a hole here Oh There we go It was worth it, but I'll never pay for it ever again either give me my account or a lot of pirates Sure, but I don't want to spend 30 bucks, you know how to wanna play a new Zeina So we would have to spend 60 bucks I Haven't even started playing yet and you are already making it not fun I Never that true You I'm a little bit scared to pirate games. Actually. I really don't want to get a virus on my computer And I don't know when to actually pirate games because I never do I Don't want tips on pirating games either. I think I just want to live my life You I'm gonna start a game run. Honestly, that might be safer than actually pirating a game You Looks good to me now, it's a practice part. There we go, 266. Hello Kha'Kiitha How are you today? What's that? I don't like the perspective headshots. Oh, that's gonna look good in motion, I think. Using pixel fill cycles, sure. I think this is pretty nice, and then we can delete the backside entirely. Somewhat low poly, too. Wait, you actually can't play Minecraft legally anymore? Why not? That's fucked up that they can just take away your privilege to play the game. Ugly ass burn, well, that's what they look like. What do you want me to do? The rules is do not get burned. I got Minecraft for like 10 bucks back at a LAN party when it was like pre-alpha. But I don't have an account anymore. When it takes away what feels retro about it, how so? Let's look at this. How do you want this to be to make it feel more retro? We have to somewhat translate it into 3D, I don't want it to just be a 2D section. Ah, I just felt like it curses. We're not even working on that yet, we're just working on Mario. And then the enemies, the clouds are just there so you can see the movement. If you have any concrete changes that you want to suggest to the way this works, you can make those suggestions, but you will have to actually tell me what you want to change. And more than likely there's going to be something you've missed and I'm going to tell you no. Well, would you want to just play a copy of Mario Land on Mario 64? What's the point in that? Right, it has to be different and I chose to make it different by having it be 3D. I keep getting an error here, I don't know where it's from. Here, view 3D something something. It just didn't say anything, it just said sorry I don't block and ignore any other email and automatic responses. Fucking rip. How to move in the camera center will help being able to see classic side unlock and surprise by getting the freedom perspective. How are you going to aim like that? And how are you going to know where the play area ends, like how far you can move? Those are two big issues with that idea. The end of the tunnel is supposed to be hidden with... fuck. Did you die? No. His head seems oddly skinny, we can take a look at that. Yeah, I kind of see how Mario's head is way too skinny here. Oh, we could do our half extra texel strategy here.  Oh wait, that's a whole texel. I think this is peak, the best we're gonna get. I'm guessing at the moment in 4-3 mode, Maren can get out of camera view slightly. We can try that. Ah, yeah, he's hitting the limit here. This thickness from Mario looks a lot better though, I agree. I really like how this feels in place. When you select the emitter, what did I have to select, Leela? Oh, it automatically has the emitter selected, I guess it's habit then. That before I literally go insane. This is the right one, right? When I look up the wings rotate on land using an instant motion might look more right though. I think I would look a little bit off, yes. I feel so exhausted today. Even though that looked so easy just now, I don't know why I'm so exhausted. Because my parents are here right now, I can't be around people for too long, no matter who it is. Guess I'm going to have to be more dominant so I can look up that way, in a smooth and right-flopping motion. Maybe. But I don't want to make two models, and this is fine, so. The thumbnail, alright let's check what changes you've made to the thumbnail. Wow. Okay, so this is gonna be a video about how some of the optimizations in Mario 64 made the game run worse. Something like the performance graph was my idea. I think Mario should be looking at the camera here. And I think it should list like a graph here with on the right side goes optimizations and on the top side it goes frame rate. And then I'm happy with it. I'm with the stonks meme face wearing Mario's cap and all wroths. No. They're rotated 180 degrees. Makes sense because they actually are rotated 180 degrees. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's important on YouTube that your thumbnails have a somewhat consistent style, because it makes people more likely to flick them. So, I have decided that the style for my thumbnails will be the random Mario from back then. So I want all my thumbnails to use that Mario. There we go, that looks decent. There's some Gliden bug here, but I don't think it's there if I look at the menu. So I'm going to have to ignore it. Gliden is a bug with point filtering where it doesn't point filter correctly. Yeah, it looks fine here. Nice. After this I have two more stages, but course 14 is already like half way done. Yeah, that's a slightly more accurate emulator. It's still not perfectly accurate, but it's better. Can you rotate the camera view a bit? How are you going to aim if I rotate the camera view? Hello Beta Sigma Omega. Yes, Leela, remember the Space Casino? Or not, the Space Arcade? Can rotate Mario? More I mean. Do you mean a shawl? I can rotate Mario's shawl a little bit. Let's see how this goes. The thing about how you're supposed to see what's right in front of you, that isn't a real issue. And maybe I should look at how they solved it in Star Fox. I think this needs to be inverted. How does Star Fox handle it when something goes through the middle of the screen? Let's look at Star Fox gameplay. I'm going to say it might be that there's too much variety. You're playing wrong and you make it very fun. I see what you mean. Every time you strive too far from your core gameplay, you turn the amount of people that like it into a Venn diagram of people that don't like these different gameplay styles. But I do keep that in mind. This is a banger zone. I'm looking at Star Fox 64 and this one's unwatchable. Is this the only way you're going to shoot at things? Oh, so if you tilt, your shot changes direction too. We could shoot in the direction of the rotations instead of forward. But it looks like even Star Fox didn't solve that issue that you were pointing out. I don't know. Maris Head is symmetrical. At least that was the intention. It's not. That's an issue, obviously. I think maybe this bird slightly skinnier would look better. Oh yeah, that's a lot nicer. Star Fox, you can move off-center and aim back. I have tried having the camera follow Mario at the beginning and it did not look good at all. It was way too much movement. We could have it slightly follow Mario. I don't know. But honestly, this doesn't seem like a big issue, right? Oh wait, he is not centered. What the fuck, you're right. I'm wrong. Wow, what the fuck? How is he not centered? I don't know.   How did that happen? There we go. That bird enemy is called a chicken. A chicken in the sky. There we go. Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew. I think it works. Let's program the shots you can shoot. See how that works out. Are these the shots? It's like... Big balls. Even when you're big, it's big balls. It's this texture here. Hello Nintendo for life. I guess this is the submarine. And this is this here. Makes sense. 8x8. It doesn't seem like a big issue at the speedrun level. You have so much time to spend in the middle of the screen. Yeah. Would 3D clouds be possible here? I have to think about it. I guess you can imagine the sprite in front of you. And then make a 3D model out of that. I kind of do both at the same time. It's the same as the bowling ball. Funny you'd say that because I got the fire bowling ball. And I don't know a bowling ball.  Holy shit. That smells like gas in here. I can't do much. I don't want to draw a 3D sprite. I want to just 3D model. One of you guys wants to make the... The 2D sprite from the front. Sure, go ahead. I'll take a look and see if I can draw any inspiration from it. But I'm not doing it. You fart? No. Yes, really. I did not fart. You laughed at me. You want to make a 2D sprite from the front? I mean, go for it. I might make changes on the model based on that. But I'm not going to completely redo the model. Hello, Biobak. Welcome to a very low energy stream today. This man is straight up streaming. Well, I mean, today is a regularly scheduled stream, so... You were supposed to expect me today.  Wow, that's terrible. 31, 93. I'll see you next time.  I think that works I don't think I still have the mile back Yeah, don't think it is mean Yes, German that was my dad French you will never catch me speaking French Zayn as tall as a cold. Yeah, she's very very cold I Saw a meme yesterday that was like me learning French so I can refuse to speak it instead of just being unable to You see it in a meme it must be true When you speak French of Mario that's tough question, you know, I I Mean Mario speaks Italian and I don't speak Italian. So that should be all the evidence you need I Do you think of my pixel art Pixel art is not real by the way, I almost forgot It's a voxel art Yeah, of course cuz pixel art is not real the voxel art actually is real Wait voxel art is real pixel art is not but voxel on absolutely is real You We are not doing the pixel art debate again not after whatever last time you ruined the entire family gathering You Fifty triangles Walk down the list for no, it's not You can have oddly shaped voxels and people go to the box I've got the name just wrong I Look so just points on a grid and minecraft version works out by the definition of voxel. It's too good No, it is still considered. It's still box art by definition It's just smaller voxels Leela is hating for no reason on minecraft villager out of all people I Let's see if this works too Since the shooting minigame it is You You know pixel means picture element and voxel means a volume element Uh-huh This isn't voxels Fair point. This is not voxels. This is a picture that indicates that you have sent an invalid link It was valid before I send it to you not my fault I'm getting gaslit again Gaslit get keep girl busts my first 64 deaths once again Google moment, this is not voxel art. How's it not? You He's a clean amongst maybe his hands aren't like if you by some definitions, but like it's very similar to what I'm doing here See what I'm sure no, it's not it's less Every 2d image can also be considered pixel art if you really want them You can't find the definition for pixel art that includes everything you consider pixel art and excludes everything. You don't consider pixel art Whereas with voxel art you can You Because I just means low-res retrons where usually color limited sprites you sure that that yet do you want that to be your definition Just make it sure you want to lock that definition in Lilaa Oh This is fair, yeah, we're getting there we're getting to horses and share I Said I don't think I don't like realism a cubism starts on there's no fix 100% I could to finish them because there's no I Could differentiate anything You are okay, you are like 80% true I Agree with you until you said there's no accurate definition of anything because there's an accurate definition of What a cubist of what a rectangle is of what a circle is of what a sphere is But yes for most words, there is no accurate definition You It definitely snuck your mom shoots I Keep it switched to German mode Am I missing anything It looks good to me No way. I'm just broken. That's so fast. I feel like I'm missing something My mom or your mom, I don't know how strong your mom is Any definition I was here would depend on a metric being used in the space of itself. I Mean if you want like the exact physical representation sure, but you can define what spheres without knowing any of that I think it shoots a bit too fast And when you twitch this case is m64 Your XC++ C++ is basically the same as C just for some extra features. So it's really just a better C I Don't really know but we're not working on it right now. We're definitely gonna make the background cooler. We haven't made the stage yet We're just getting the basics You This is not gonna sound good, but does it sound like in Mario Land 3 a marmalade? Do we have a sound like that The extra features and extra complexity and extra room for error on the same thing But you can literally just take a C code and have that be your C++ fault What's there in C that doesn't just work in C++ And then point code in C Yes, that's what I'm saying. It's just Same with extra features and that's exactly what I said We try this sound All the restrict keyword is gone in C++ that sucks I Need this louder I can't hear it You I don't know why program. That's the way it bursts. I don't like the sound When I send it to you discord or just like an ember link twitch chat Something an elevator effect. It's the cannon effect And I agree. It's not good I am NOT playing to the back lock That sounds terrible What's this unknown salt, you know, maybe that's a good one Turn on boom effect Doesn't sound right to me It's like a boulder moving effect Shallots of all types out. I think that could work It's very Mario esque It's gonna take a bit to compile You And let's see this How that's kind of nice Now we're just gonna make the birds react to it and explodes and have some damage bar when you touch them All right, let's see this in your image I  Hello Yoshi party Alright, let's see if we can make changes to our bird based on this I'm fine with this one Hashtag embers very useful only in C. I don't know that one either. Sorry in SFX from bullet bill being fired You're absolutely, right I Hounding cannon we can try this Let's try this and then if this doesn't work, we go back to the other sound. Hello, Davy Or no one had birds and planes. Yep Oh That's nice I Like it All right, let's see you kind of meet an X here for that we would need one two, three, four five one two, three, four five six Seven pixels Okay, this might be a bit of an issue because if we go with your sprite his head would be three times as big Which I think might be a bit much The wings are very similar looking I do like the eyes you made though Yeah, no if we go with your sprites, I think I think we can do that Let me just think about the best course of action here You This should be free white free so I need to extend it to in each direction You like so And then on this side as well I think if we just change the head that's fine, right? That's a covering basically everything that's important Oh, did I want this here? I guess I do. So I think this part can stay. This part will be part of this. And this part needs to be separate. Why do you can delete the rest of it, since you can see it anyway? Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, but no, that's not what I want. Don't worry, I have a plan. Let me put on the Mario Galaxy OST again. Does it look like a secret base? Yes. Just start this. I'm not really worried about performance in this area here. This area will perform really well either way, I think. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. And I like Soul, I guess, in the end. Did I get offset by one pixel? I think I did. One, two, three, four. Yeah, this is weird. I feel like it should be this, but it's not. Should it be this? It seems about right. It's three. One, two, three. Yeah, okay. This is what we want. So, this white pixel should probably just be gone here. Oh, right. We have this issue here. Oh, right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.   All right. All right. There we go. That's nice. Why not just make the head a little round pixel? What is a round pixel? You prefer my stream on YouTube? Is the quality better? I'm not doing one Maze of Mordor Mario. I thought about it actually, but I just couldn't think of anything that's actually fun. Oh yeah, that looks a lot better. This is kinda nice. Yes, that is possible daily, and that's likely also going to be an optimization we do. It's depending on the level and the microcode you run could depend because some levels are better on RSP and some are better on RDP. Still need to fix that one lighting bug in X2, and I have no idea how. That's absolutely required for actually, it's not absolutely required for the demo. I can just remove lighting from the demo still. It would be a bit sad if you couldn't see the lighting from the stars. Yeah, I see what you mean. I'm learning some of the models for the wing animation. On one hand, that's fair. On the other hand, that's a lot of 3D model data I also need to store on top, and I think we don't actually have the capacity to do that. This is just way easier. It's still, we're gonna, we're running close here. This already has 19,000 triangles and it's like barely finished. We still need the outside here. So many people have suggested the camera angle change, but then like, how do you even aim? And what is an efficient system for making these collidable? You can change microcode mid-frame, but I think that's not very wise. Make the black balance better, consider horizontal. I see why you're saying that, yes. It's an easy way to do it. I could do this. Actually I thought this looked a lot better already. Doesn't follow your sprite, but yeah. Does this remove the birds that have only planes? That is facts, facts, facts. Is that possible? I don't think so. I got to make the beak like on the sprite. Yeah, I didn't really want to change the beak so much. It's also getting higher and higher, Paulie. I think we just have to go with this. What, Leela? Did you miss? We changed the birds a little bit. Let me get this now. Oh yeah, this outline on the birds makes them so much easier to see. All right, best way to make the birds shootable. We can just iterate over all cannon shots on every single bird. Does it seem asymmetrical leaning right in the game? Yes, they will look a little bit asymmetrical, but that's a graphic plugin bug. There is a problem in the graphic plugin where the texture is not going to look right because it's a point filter texture. Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about that. It's just that the graphic plugin is broken like that. Yeah, I'm hoping Gliden either gets updated or RT64 comes out before my hack releases. Because right now the sag is in a state where playing it and you need like very specific setups. Not how much thought I put into that variable name. Crazy, or not? I'm trying to find a good hat I can give, but I can't. Boi light, boi gas light. It's not out Leela, what are you on about? You know what, I'll ask Wiseguy himself right now. Is RT64 out already? I don't think so. He said no, not as a plugin and won't be out for emulator for a while. Get this, I'm so happy about this. It works on emulator or just wants to run it for the emulator? Leela, literally the dev has told me it's not out yet. He lost, just blew up. What about this then? It's not ready for consumers. I will believe that it's out once one of the two devs tells me it's out. It's as simple as that. I'm not boi-lying. I will DM Mario. I'm not boi-lying. Yeah, you're not wrong. Why would you not be able to escape from 64? That seems silly. How is this not working? Oh wait. Wait, it still doesn't make any sense. How did it just instantly kill itself? I don't think so. Guys it's not about me it's about the end user being able to use the thing hello the perfect mario 64 if you need to compile it then the end user is definitely not going to be able to play my game i don't want people to have to compile a plugin to play my game so i'm going to compile it and then i'm going to play my game cool Lilaa we need to look at how they die here oh my god how are we gonna do that animation what the fuck wait what if we just have it be an animated texture we're actually not doing a voxel art here we just make this texture spawn wait it's that simple you can do compile plugin with your hack the less people have to set up better this is something that rom hackers severely underrate and it's the barrier to entry every step along the way like opening project 64 setting to 8 megabytes clicking the rom patching the rom you lose some percentage of your player base and the more unusual your setup is the higher the percentage will be so it is something i'm very worried of it just switches between those 8 frames of each okay so on that switch between two vectors let's play for 8 frames switch from time to before dying so crazy cool so shouldn't affect the project face the camera i have them faced the same way that we do in mario land one i thought that was the most appropriate way of doing this um let me just get this texture here and cut out what i need honestly i don't think it's completely out of the question that rty will come bundled with an emulator that just automatically is configured to work on rty i think that that is like a huge reason why people like the pc port just because like it's not as much configuring work and people just cannot handle the configuring work and i get it working with tank is insanely frustrating i'm gonna you actually no i'm gonna use falco buster's png fixer hello nice day to be a clown isn't it i'm going to be super aggressive about it yourself yeah but i'm sure no one did that so oh no there's just a song with the one guy on the guitar that goes you think we're ready to use it just selects a clean room and patches it and launches it in there automatically yeah exactly that would be awesome so i'm able to use uh whatever works and it's open source i guess so i feel like i should make these transparent here so you're playing a demo every day that's crazy i'm gonna release a new demo at some point in the near future so you can finally play that but it's just going to be the first course um where you answer this question but did you fear that it ended with your fan project and were you supposed to be listening like that portal 64 was closed by the creator because valve didn't want to support them it seems very dishonest to me to say that nintendo shut that down i think instead it was just like oh nintendo shut it down this is the perfect moment for me to just say goodbye because i've been working on this for years and i did all the fun parts and now all the suffering begins where i have to recreate every single piece of content from the portal and i don't want to do that but fortunately nintendo just or valve just gave me a reason to stop and now i can just do that that's how i understood that oh that's nice why is that why i didn't quit i think what's going to bother about that that's a bot but it's still him yeah exactly it was him that closed it but yes of course there is a worry that nintendo is just going to say now fuck you your game is over but you just have to live with that it's all you can do  i'm not sure yet davy honestly nintendo has not bullied me in quite a while the last time they bullied me was in like 2019 yeah recom is really clean recom can do a lot of things  bear fairpoint was 64 should we transfer for the inner part? you might be right i will try this for now and if it looks bad i will change it oh wait you're coming to me just seems like pcbot was slightly different well yes it is just pcbot but slightly different the thing about it though is that it supports a lot of like modding frameworks the same way minecraft modding works and it's maintained by wiseguy who's actually a really good programmer and i don't think the pcbot has any decent programmers still left on it i don't know if i'm right i just know that the pcbot was mostly made as like a proof of concept and then all the programmers kind of just jumped off and a bunch of people jumped onto it that have no idea what they're doing which is not the case for recom they're good programmers then? oh okay never mind then what is going on? since when can switch bones hold the weight? interesting yeah but it has more than that it doesn't even need to decomp i'm gonna leave your steps when from sources when you say controls like yeah that's true although it's important to keep in mind that decomp and pc port are not the same thing let's see how this works out yes that's what they do spook what the hell? did i select the bad material? 3d light material and... what is going on? do i need to set this to 2? i think i might need 2 eat, keep, grow, gaslight, grow, fail? shut up you're so mean to me okay yeah it needs the white part inside i don't think you are a girl failure i'm not i'll definitely publish everything including assets i don't like how they disappear it's like it gets smaller when they disappear what if we do this? at some point have a projector project onto a wall you can go behind without going down it looks static but if you're behind mario will end up in the projection with everything in the projector that's a cool effect but n64 might not be the right architecture for that oh yeah this looks good i like that yeah i would release the blend files as well alright now that we have this done what we need next is just the enemy airplanes and their bullet bill and then we have all the assets done and we can make the level we also need to make mario damageable so he can actually lose here one worry i have a little bit is that you can just stand in the middle and dodge everything and if we don't do that then everything is just gonna walk into the camera which is not gonna look really bad looks like it's fucked did you see the beginning? ok you can kill the birds now i forgot to give the cannonballs fuck nothing important should cannonballs still need an impact? oh maybe honestly yes they should let's make that change do you want a bullet bill front view sprite? yeah that could help although the sprite is so small i feel like there's not much detail you have to work with oh nice they now fade into white perfect that's what we want yeah this is sweet i'm very happy with this i feel like i don't have the energy to stream much longer though so we're gonna put a stop to it here and i'm probably gonna finish the bullet bills off stream onionkit if you want you can send them to me on discord like in my discord that would be perfect where the fuck happens later on don't worry it was there i saw it but yeah until next time bye bye
