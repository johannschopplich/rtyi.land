We're live-streaming today doing some of the hacking thing You No chat is something wrong Just status waiting for messengers am I locked in on the wrong account no fucking way I Might be Yep, yep All right, how do you promote twitch chat again Fellas how do you pop out the twitch chat? And I guess I need my youtube chat to this sucks I Do not like restream Hello YouTube channel distant peek a little fluff squirrel. Hello Seamars. Have I played Mario builder 64? No, I can just make romhacks Why would I play Mario builder 64? Think about it for a second Guys how do you pop up twitch chat? I forgot Hello Biobak Are you ready for oily boily day? Yo, let's go. I Really need it's in the chat settings the chat settings box and does not work. Look I click on it and nothing happens What the fuck Let me just refresh the page hello me here They open for a microsecond What if I just go here's that's that's that instead of power chat it is I Can just go to it manually? cool cool Is today the oily boily day Biobak I was working a lot of stream Let me show you guys what I've done before oily boily day starts So I worked on this little block right here since we're on Yoshi's Island we need lots of Clark's And they tried to make a freezie, but I'm not really happy with it yet. I Don't think it looks very good yet Hello, I on stream And Mostly I was working on Doing some stuff to course one. I'm thinking what we should do is make another demo with just course one and then we use that to get Feedback on the physics and the camera and I think that would be fun to help us make the game more fun I'm going to visuals of this a little bit So right here now it like fades out to the bottom we somewhat didn't have that before Make them dark eyes. Yeah, I'm still working on it and I'm completely reworking this area here with the boss This is very much not finished though, but I was thinking something like this You know with the god race from the top I Think this has potential It kind of look poopy before I think just having some lighting in here already changes a lot Drew by your back we could probably do something kind of like that. We could change it per area if we really want it I Am not sure what else I did Currently waiting for the Biobak thing You Kiki's in the trees kind of fit because if you're too silent, but at the same time, that's not really what the level is about We need to completely rework this entire overworld Because I'm making it so in the open hand model for Mario is used in my animations I can double jump or dive It kind of fits the double drum, yeah, I don't think that's a terrible idea Let's be finished this year. No, probably not Yeah, this will be finished today it's true It should get spammy YouTube ten sometimes it's like less populated. So people have like conversations one-on-one, I guess Your two favorite Mario characters Dry bones and Yoshi You guys are exaggerating I've not been working on it this long Okay, think about this Mario Odyssey came out in like 2017 and there's not been a new mainline Mario game since then And they've been working on that like three years longer than me Well, is that I said Reset for 11 months. Hello. I have one car. Thank you for the gift. I could not read that but oh My bakery No idea what that means And Mario doesn't use a base game well Mario Galaxy to that but it's also a full fucking team so I mean doesn't really matter Plus I have like remade so much stuff. They probably use a base engine. I couldn't If you're wondering what I'm doing right now I'm waiting for a while back to send me the oily body of a model But I guess until then we can take a look at the freezer here. See if we can improve them So I wanted him I think this is pretty much to mark a double-dash model Let's see breezy Actually, that one is way more blue, isn't it? Yeah This one has drawn on textures, which we could probably do also any LST wishes I Have never used blender ambient occlusion up so I have no opinion on it It's a bit curious But yeah either way we're gonna just leave it at that. I      Don't know what we're looking at here Everything's frozen. Okay quick. Let's use Shade color alpha to make this a bit darker which could look good I Standing right now nice nice Like one of the edges at a second cycle a little bit of a shade color alpha and didn't make just the ice dark Let's try that real quick Cool If you want to use your mask, just press this into the water  I'm gonna press this into the water Oh, the inside is brighter here What if I make the outside brighter Doesn't really make a huge difference, does it? Actually, this kinda does look a lot nicer Add one layer between We're not doing triple overdraw Put my balls in your mouth That doesn't work like that I didn't feel like Marth at all Alright, let's take a look at Biobak's Oily Boily Bay remake Biobak Oily Boily Bay What are you cooking? Biobak's cooking Yes, Lila, I have a summer curd Right here, you see this, guys? This will make N64 development a good amount faster I do like the Brawler64 controller That makes sense, Biobak I actually agree, yes How often do you drink coke, then go outside and take a 4-mile hike, then eat dinner in a chain restaurant, then go home and relax in a coat? That never happened So, zero Coke I have 2 gigabytes of space left This is not good The problem is, it just keeps clogging itself back up, I don't know how to clean it I know, I know, I fell off, what am I supposed to do? This looks crazy Right, wrong blender version I forgot Can I take my music course on this? No Oh, it might just look like that, because my course isn't being picked up by OBS I don't know why, because I explicitly turned it on before But my OBS is cursed, if I ever click on it, it just crashes Okay  Oh no, my Blender 4 controls are completely fucked Oh no Okay Where is the mouse zoom thing again? Oh Shit, does anyone remember? Navigation Symptom mouse position, there we go Console left and right click are swapped Oh my god, dude, the colors, they look so glowing Holy shit This is like so vibrant This tower looks so cool Alright, this is an awesome remake already Look how this is shining Look what he did to this This looks actually insane Add any of him Oh Did he change the background at all? Probably not Alright, look at the changelog Where is the changelog again? Changelog, oh, changelog.txt Don't change this What's that mean? Dude, I really need to change the selection, I really need to control the back Like the yellow beam walls You wanna hang on to those? I'm not sure I understand That should not affect collision at all Let me see what you mean, I'm just gonna go into the level myself F So you think you can't hang on to those? I don't understand Sure, hold on, that one has rocks on the top Maybe he has like an old version of the- There was a bug in the game, that, you know, made hanging difficult It was very obvious in OnlyUp64 I'm gonna move Dude, the new colors are awesome Maybe I can, like, import this somewhere Right, there was a way to just import your controls Emap Ah, there we go Click on the blender logo in the corner I don't see a blender logo in any corner This one here? Oh, there we go Yeah, is this better? Yeah, this is almost the controls I'm used to The one weird thing is that this has like semi-extra controls Which, I think that's this button Yeah, there we go This is what I'm used to Alright, alright I have a question Do you think that the total amount of triangles increased or decreased in this level? I think it's somewhat increased here, if I look at this Because there's so much stuff here and here But I don't think that is significant enough to be a problem for a lot Okay, you remove materials, that's very good I imagine these are all- Yep, they are all the same Nice, nice, nice, nice Okay, as usual, we're gonna go over the changelog one by one And make sure every single change is fine in one way or the other Just export it and see if it runs well Great idea, Lilaa Surely this will work fine I'm just gonna go and export it Surely this will work Wait, you checked that it exports? Generally? That's insane Alright It actually exports Usually, it does       Usually, these never export right away Dang it Ah, you removed this So I guess we don't need the text scroll anymore Okay, it actually exported Let's look at it in-game Hello, Hoshi Yeah, yeah, definitely, Biobak Okay Got a few issues Your problems But some of the level is here Dude this is actually an insane effect houses being rendered wait what this is some lens of truth bullshit Yeah All right, let's go over the level and fix the issues shall we I Updated the lighting and geo Remove nose note based shading and shaded stuff manly because I didn't like it and the single light source doesn't make sense since there's no Sun in the sky true. You are correct. And yeah, you're right. This looks way better The vario mine cooper place, yeah exactly Wait, this is supposed to not have fuck Okay, fuck always needs to be to cycle Missing paths Okay, let's let's try and get our presets here, how do you do that in fast 64 I Really like you would know this where do you get the the materials? How that's no big deal by back there really easy to remake but this one here is set to fuck but it's not two seconds So it doesn't work You In terms of what the user presets here just as missing paths Because they have a lot of fuser presets here that I would like to use I Fucking awesome long windows. I'm down to 1.6 gigabytes. How did you break that? I didn't do anything And works in 3.4 I Where are the user presets No user presets here cool I Know where are they? You would know this I want to set this to V color fucked. Oh My god doesn't look so much better true and that's actually look insane like how vibrant the colors are is crazy And this to do look at this So so smooth now And this is also much more fitting Okay, while Lilaa tells me where the presets are stored. I'm gonna go over to change luck Main walkways are now red a pink so they don't look too warrior ish. Yep. Yep. Good point updated main walkway texture so that it mirrors and turns properly All workers are now half the quads because of this. Oh Oh, I see This was this used to be mirrored in the middle. Oh shit That is yeah. Why didn't I do that? That's a crazy improvement Well, actually this one is still up. I keep up make sense here Perfect seamless flawless UV mapping not even a changelog just bragging Cool new containers true. These containers are very colorful. Very nice. I like him a lot Very nice work updated a big fan design no big pipe Fan oh, I see. Yep. That is more fitting. I Have your presets in a breeze energy. It would work. Okay, but there is no preset directory. I'm asking you. Where's the preset directory? Unless you don't know You know, if you don't know that's fine. You can admit that Right if I look at here there's no preset directory there need to be there isn't Where is this supposed to be storage? To delete this no, it works fine in 3.4. It doesn't work in 4.0. Do you understand Lila? Look here I can literally just open anything and look at my presets. No Yes Look at this you Lilaa all my user presets are right here It was a presets folder where Blenders already on like 4.1. Hello divas In the preset folder I passed there's a preset folder I passed an old preset folder      You need this this is not for 64 this is something else Updated Bowser Tower based on sexy brutalist architecture. Yeah, this is very fitting Yeah, this is a new Biobak new album just dropped by Biobak I'm so glad he didn't let the toilet on top This definitely looks very brutalist though. This actually just looks like Bowser is your boss and makes your life miserable No, don't don't do the toilet Okay This might be an issue. Oh You put this on layer six, but mark. This is a transparent decal that actually is fine, but I'd rather make sure it's completely fine By setting this on layer six. We actually need to swap layer six and layer five And the entire game because it makes no sense that transparent decals render after transparent surfaces Yeah, but these need to be aligned these also need to be world access aligned so the way step rendering is gonna be very fucking Town doesn't have to Kirk is cleansing style. Yeah, but it's brutalist architecture fits this so much better on the same Disable and enable fast 64 big man. All right I Abled enabled They're still missing What if I just test If I create a test it's still here No The issue is that the folders changed there somewhere else now it just initializes the folder and it doesn't exist anymore I'm pretty sure Oh Yeah VGC's but that's unrelated to fast 64 so that can't be it How is this on the V color fuck the preset when it doesn't exist I am so upset You We call on there we go, I'm just gonna make no presets I give up There we go Let's export this once more just to make sure it's fine Let's let's fix all the obvious visual issues first Yeah, no, don't worry do you think stuff was that was a good hint That was a good thing to point out No What do you mean? No, don't you want to see this level in game to make sure it looks fine? It's not gonna take very long, don't worry Look for your old ones you could have just copied them from your old blender version. No, that's what I tried to do Lila, but I couldn't find them. That's why I asked you for the folder This woman is death It's gonna look like the model manner so you can just look at the model first I Mean I guess that's one way to look at it. Yeah Yeah, a few of these materials are missing the fog but no big deal, honestly Really the fact that all the these stones are gone is the one big issue here Don't shame sleeping on the floor I'm gonna do something fucked up Right, I also really need to fix the collision map here I Shouldn't have done a collision map before Biobak was done Biggest mistake of my life. I love the beard. I am glad you like to see the Rambos cover room All right Brain manipulating optical illusion window. Oh these ones here Yeah, it works because you're looking at it from this during gameplay so it should be fine Forced at a roof because you can just barely see it from the highest crane. Oh, okay. Well, okay This roof is no big deal because it's four triangles and like yeah. Oh It's this is this a sneaky unnecessary triangle I think it is Two of them even transfer from what is going off really? Yes, there's a slight difference in vertex color here All right, well accept that Wrong thing in front of Bowser's Tower is tower heliport That's good this wasn't actually supposed to be a heliport and then I just kind of couldn't find a good H texture and I was just like Fuck it Why so if not two tries for the UV map here? Upgraded the power plant with some electrical looking bullshit. This is definitely electrical looking bullshit And the engineers and shit can tell me if any of this shit makes any sense I Have no idea how electricity works so I made whatever a little good honestly, this is how electricity works in the Mario universe now Your spark particles we can absolutely add spark particles here. Alright, I'm gonna add that to the notes Make spark particles move along the electric generator New transmission tower wise included to fade them out. However, you can since we don't have a vertex alpha Yeah, these kind of just don't fade out. We can just rely on an optical illusion with the floor here It works well enough. Oh, but this does need to be set to V color fucked Well, I guess we can do that at the end I mean the wires You know, oh you want the wires to fade hot here. Oh, I see Okay This is a bit of an issue what we can do is we can just duplicate this and make this a decal Kind of like the decal on the floor here and then we just have to decal move here Should be no issue I Updated zip lines Yeah, it's not gonna be a big deal Yeah, that does look better I think cool cool Updated both the statue post and shading He looks like he's going oh my head Shouldn't you focus on fixing was already there. Uh-huh. What do you mean? Yeah, it looks pretty nice updated all drilling machine basis, oh, yeah, I saw this very glowing Updated crane design now looks less like a boat better secured container. Oh That does look really nice it might look so stolen from banjo-kazooie So I'm glad you cannot just did it into this because this is so much better Yeah, but Lena Biobak wants me to look at the full level first so we're doing that it doesn't really matter Updated entrances to underwater area. Oh, yeah. I saw this earlier It's Looking pretty good replaced metal barriers with concrete barriers near to wiggler LDS yeah good Hmm this something about this friend. I'm really wrong earlier. It was like really really blue for some reason But I don't see the reason here That's one few material. Oh true updated rising platform basis Racing platforms. Oh these here. Okay. Nice. Nice Underwater area the first note on the underwater area says just fucking look at it Oh That's this area yet, ooh It's this area too Now area two is this area three is this area four is this five. Oh my god That is very very cool. Oh My god, dude, he went all out on this. Holy shit. This is where the oil drills go This actually looks insane Actually lower poli now around 1,700 fewer tries not really surprising though Yeah, I did not optimize the poly count here at all With the lighting here Possible have the oil light only affect Mario when he's above it Sure we can do that Dynamic lighting in area six Oil disease With the I'm in this room with extra lights are staring me in all the fucking colors by hand. Oh my god All is to take just it should scroll at different speeds in different directions Sure, no problem and love about fedora. Oh, I already did that No, wait, I added oil bubbles here. You want both lava and oil bubbles That might be a bit awkward to do but I think I can do it Kuzma's transition between regular and slippery floors. Oh What the hell how's this done Oh, this is just one texture map like that's I see that's pretty nice So I changed here where the accordion platforms go on the left wall Left wall, I'm guessing that's this part here. Oh You remove the big pipes or Did you remove them on purpose? Updated out there's areas with new colors actual ground and the concrete pillars from above walls are in texture now Ah, yeah, I'm the wall spring it actually does look better If the summary doesn't have its own unique music it should use one of my noobs bonus tracks Oh, you guys have never heard this before. I actually never showed this off. Let me show you Look at the names wait first. I need to look at the names on biomex request Can't walk and catwalk. Oh, that's what these two textures were for. I see I show you the this song though Yeah Dude where is the entrance? Where did the entrance go Oh This is because it's still the collision map from before the rework. That's why it's kind of hard to see anything right now place the sub area there what do you mean it just crashes right now god damn it let me see but do not this one either where is it oh it's this of course I do Yoshi name case the fact that you made this tiles in this room be almost but not exactly squares is that you should go sit in the corner yeah that was an accident I think I added one too little when I subdivided it whoops all right next the factory section I don't think that's this part here that's the boss area oh this is the factory the shift space I want to play the animations all day oh yeah this is nice oh and this is one material too nice gray colors here too I like it how this looks crazy the actors are there for visual only you can just delete the object before importing all right it's part of collection one anyway so at the grayscale aesthetic I thought it looked nice yeah it does look nice but with the yellow especially it makes it pop very well I think I think I should animate stuff like this to just like a little bit you know maybe I have to speed in and out I'm gonna add that to my let's see an area six rail one area for me every light animate in some way it's just pulsing what about very very light pulsing here it's like the most minimal pulsing added a bit of decoration yeah a bit is good the oldest burns your ass I like that like gates of the useless gameplay parts this too very nice oh is this an easter egg this is a whole ass Easter egg oh that's cool I see I see yes so I'm pretty sure his idea was to put a Cooper in here oh wait read the screenshot oh it's per room room one nothing particular here the vibe is cool though room to edit some extra unreachable zones there should be doors that can be opened in the walls move the energy just a little bit for aesthetic purposes change the pipe so you can climb back up easier if you let the weight platforms go all the way down instead of this one nice nice guys every in the middle is now integral for East Egg room purposes all right East Egg room secret channel accessible by a hole in the wall which is right here it's too small room with a Cooper running on a hamster wheel if you talk to him he says huff puff sorry can't talk that's my turn to part of factory when you talk to him he slows down to walk so the lights flicker and the pipes turn off prim color like it's actually part of the whole factory by running pipes on okay your pipes off you have one all right prim color of the thing at the end of pipes can just be set to black the end of the pipes set the bottom here or so complicated to think and the lights you can just overlay black onto the screen oh no it's it's doable to flicker the lights although that might not affect this so I might have to overlay a little bit of black on the screen all right this is gonna be glorious but then you can actually go here too and then there's this thing here which you would assume is an exit so what do we do about that do you just fall out the factory and die or something I don't know we might just have to put like bars in front of it all the doors are fake for theory of it okay but what do we put here right cuz like you can jump in here and then what you're just kind of stuck we can't really have that right I do not like Super Mario Sunshine you do a power down and teleport Mario into room that upside down lights and speeds up again yeah kinda okay let me explain you come to this room right through this part but then you walk here and you walk here and you fall here I know you're stuck here aren't you oh wait you can't just walk out of here oh so there needs to be a closed door in here oh I see I didn't realize that this was gonna be open all right so we just put some coins in here to make it look like it has a purpose but before you have the easter egg found gotcha sounds good platforms treadmills now in the floor because it looks better wait first a bunch of cool quartz now true the quartz actually connected all the way through for that little extra continuity I'll click the top on the left wall to slide and you'll see I'm not sure I understand the request here but I can see that they are actually very connected so I think I understood your request anyway it's probably just scrolling texture multiplied by prim or something I would imagine yeah you just snarp into it oh there's one change we might have to do and that is that we do this this is a bit fucked up for you to know but if you use text 1 or 0 in cycle 2 no I think if you use text 1 in cycle 2 it's actually gonna be offset by half a texel or by like a full texel in the texture so it's not gonna look exactly like a blender but I just fixed that so don't worry okay that now is inside the floor because it looks better oh I see yep yep I agreed the composition is just a slightly for aesthetic purposes okay yeah topo is garbage in places but it's for lighting oh yeah this is all fine oh I need to display I don't see the triangle count displayed anywhere where was this there we go it's only 4400 who cares I'm picking they're more versatile than quads and cottages two tries that's like asking pick one protons or the uranium you know what I mean okay well I like this the funny cubes are funny bunch of bolts in here interesting makes sense though the watch extra it looks like the letters from Gandhi industries kinda I like this this is all shaded so nicely dude holy shit last room it's gonna be like oh yeah that's the lunchroom sorry some shit change pipe layouts to make it simpler it's now easier to go back from a fully low on weight platform okay yeah we're gonna have to mark these climbable so that this is actually gonna happen but yes I said stuff more detail on the asset part of the change duct this is just to explain the concepts while you're in the factory the texture on the top and edges of the treadmill scrolls oh so I need to actually open the files here to understand what you're talking about here deleted the oh no I just hit them I can just unhide them picture on top and the edge of the scrolls so okay this one scrolls and it goes around here oh yeah that's kind of not really good right but it was off by default and they turn on by pair some more steps on them just goes on opposite direction of the platform rising lowering oh so you want one to scroll inwards and the other outwards yeah that's good can I say no can just rotate around the origin instead of needing to be animated with bones and the light turns off when doing so oh I see yeah that definitely works okay easy easy no problem let me just every of four animates all the lights since we're posted by bio like and it's gonna be a lot of work that's gonna be worth it so much boss arena should be areas five six four three there we go oh my god this is glowing red I'm a bit worried that someone might reach the edge here and then just walk around there I don't like the process oh but they're so far out it's probably fine new look and lighting change the underground cave bunker vibe because I couldn't make it nice enough you know what this is much nicer anyway all these metal platforms fit this a lot better hello spaghetto cool pipes definitely very cool pipes here dude it's gonna be so sad that no one is actually gonna see all that stuff because they're just gonna be looking at like this little platforming thing here maybe during the intro they see this and it's gonna be such a vibe cool pipes cages lightly moved hopefully it doesn't mess anything up you might need to do the cutscene a little bit this is gonna mess something up because the Koopa throwing stuff was very very accurately calculated so I'm gonna have to redo that the oil is not the same you can see how it like close to what's the edges here Easter egg idea H in one of those corners where the NPC can actually talk to you says hey I don't want to bother you but have you noticed we're all trapped in cages go beat that thing hmm ideally I want the player to be unable to actually reach the sides here but with so much geometry here we definitely have to make this walkable oh but you know what considering all these new surroundings we could make it so that the one guy that throws the soap is just like not trapped here and he's the one with the Easter egg text you think that's that's a good way to do it Bimac I think that's a you definitely need more coins in that area maybe coins toss maybe coins with a goop that you can have to surf on you think it's too difficult aren't there like 20 coins already I mean I can just add more no actually I think there's like 12 coins so you have 20 alpha this can fall like 10 times no goop texture to match the block might need to be animated or something true you get kicked around all the time all right well if there's really too little we'll see that in the play tests and if you have playtested and notice there's a little then maybe I can just add a few where are my coin piles oh did I just add two per thing I can just change this to rule three and that should spawn one more coin on each side yeah I bet you guys didn't know that you can just change beeper I'm free of a coin formation to do that maybe when the star goes out to pop nah what video plugin do you recommend for your roaming a missing link maybe glidon maybe jumble parallel should work too honestly most of them should work all right that's it for this area dude this is such a cool office concrete inside to match the concrete outside yeah this is definitely very concretey look at this glowing couch dude this looks so 3d and it's just a flat triangle what is this oh this is one of those flames I guess we don't have those flames anymore because we now have proper light from the top I can definitely make it so that the light actually comes from the top here by making it pretty dark and then just adding a light object here you actually made them all yourself that's crazy the only way I could even think to do something like this is to like 3d model the whole couch and then take a screenshot or something this texture is kind of nasty looking right it is the last impact texture I can see that but like oh also we really don't need print I don't know if this is on purpose Biobak but let me just make a preset here and then just apply this to everything there we go this is one rdb comment every time so it's a little more optimal is that something right well you can only darken it like that but you only use this on alpha and you always had the alpha set the one so you would just you know make the texture smaller that way as in like you would make the edges disappear a little bit insane concrete combiner alright let's look at this insane concrete combiner I'm assuming this is fine to just set to one the problem with having n fear is that n can be set to any value and at time so that's a bit of an issue same here like if this is the thing then sometimes the texture might just disappear randomly is this the concrete all right this one here texture 0 minus shade color multiply by texture 1 combined minus shader okay so we're lerping into prim via shade which lets you do the glow at the top and then you color it in by doing the subtractive in psycho one interesting yeah That's a pretty good one. Raise the ceilings a little bit. Very fitting, yeah. This is funny, the frilly carpet here. Okay, so speak in hieroglyphs, Tovari. It made a ton of sense, if you know what I was talking about. Okay, so we kept the gameplay here. Just made it look a lot prettier, that's good. Add a big window to the first floor, render the skybox plus water outside. Big window. Right. Oh, the first floor is on top. Oh, I see. Oh, oh, that's gonna look cool. Another layer to the carpet for more fuzziness. Definitely. There's something you could do. Dan suggested this. You have the same grass texture twice and you overlay it on top of each other. And then depending on the camera, you move one by like a textile or so. You know what I mean? The idea with that is... Okay, you know what? I can't find a decent image. But the idea is, I think, the same as like... Cute fur shader. Maybe volumetric fur or something. Nevermind, I have no idea what it's called. But you get the idea or you don't. Fuck it, I don't care anymore. Bowser's office is now unreachable. You have to look through the blinds. Okay. Right, we talked about this on Discord. So he wanted to change it so that you actually have to like sit on the seat here. And you have to look through this into Bowser's office. And then you would see Bowser complain and have his funny animations here. Which I think is pretty good. Oh my god, the lighting here. You see that shit? That's so cool. Wow. And I'm guessing these flames can go through. I haven't elevated Dark Souls once, so I wouldn't know. Alright. This is very nice. Alright, Biomike, can we import this now? Am I free to do this? I am eager to see this in-game. New chair? I don't know. Oh yeah, I didn't even look into Bowser's office properly. But yes, there is a new chair. Very much an office chair now. Alright, let's do this. Okay, so why are these never rendering? I bet it's because the crane material changed. Like, you know how some offices have pictures of the plants? Or pictures of their CEO? We should... Oh yeah, office pictures are funny. Oh yeah, about pictures. Okay, there's... Someone pointed this out on the Clips show. Which I am streaming on right now, so this person might even be watching. But let me present... What they pointed out. And I think they might have a little bit of a point. So if you look at this level here... All is fine, all is fine, all is fine. But... These billboards in the background... I think the art style is kind of very different from the rest of the game. Like, the way the Koopas are drawn. I think maybe we should change this a little bit. Like, this one is fine. I'm pretty sure this one is fine. But like, the one on the left and the one on the right... Kind of have like a weird Koopa face compared to the rest of the game. What do you guys think? Just like the face of the Koopas is what I'd like to change maybe. Hmm. It's literally in world art. Truly, yeah. Yeah, kinda. You don't need to update them. I'm just thinking about it. Oh yeah, you guys want to see another cool mechanic I added today? So you can jump on Goombas normally, right? But if you hold the A button... You jump higher. And you regain some control of Mario. Kinda like how the old Mario games work. The 2D ones. I think it kinda makes sense to have this as a mechanic. Dude, the movement in this game feels so good to me now. It's so fun to just move around. Oh, you guys have to be so jealous right now. Sorry. Ah! Oh yeah!       This should not be an issue. I hate it. I keep trying to do ground pound dives and other hacks. Because you can't go back to vanilla Mario 64 after playing with these. That's fair. But not just that. Also all the removed frames where you can't input Mario. Everything just flows into each other so much better. How many Yoshi plushies do you own? Somewhere between 15 and 30. I have no idea. Dude, my parents are going to visit us next month. And they bought so many Yoshi plushies. But if Nintendo had employed you back in 1996, I would have burned the whole company down. I would have been... I'm not finishing this job. I'm not finishing this job. Instantly go to mesh data, but where is the texture set? Train material. Uh-huh. Maybe if I update this material, it will work fine. Just as you noticed, the blue underwater area is loaded and visible from the main area. Oh, that would mess with things. Hey guys, did you know orange rhymes with gullible if you say it slowly? Yeah, I knew that. Do we really need this to run four times? I don't think we do. I think this was supposed to run once, and not four times. Yeah, I'm like 100% sure it was. East, north, south, west. Okay, makes sense. Okay, I don't think this is gonna fix them not showing up, but it's definitely a good thing to do. When I'm putting a demo with the same gun as the first one, but with the updates and new engine, and not just the first level. Because that's a lot more work. And I don't want to keep all three levels playable just when I update the demo. The idea is that I will just keep updating the demo and like optimizing course one. So I can, you know, have everything be playtested all the time. Well, okay, now the idea for a demo is not just to just release another demo. The idea for it is that it would give me a lot of playtest data that I would like to have. For like camera stuff, because course one has a lot of stuff that I need to test with the camera. Right, like jumping between two straight walls, poles, slides, open level. And a lot of physics stuff that I like tested. So it makes for a very good test area. I think I'm gonna remove... No, I can't just remove this quad. Oh, what the hell happened to his face? There's a depth issue here. I guess it is what it is. Became Mark. What is this? I don't understand. Who is this Mark person? Oh, did I just spot an... I spotted... I spotted unnecessary triangles. Now we've got him. We can't buy a bike in the act. Wait, are they necessary? Ain't no way. Definitely not. What the fuck? What is going on here? Why is it like this? Wait, are they necessary after all? Mark, oh. Okay, so this is required because of the Yurima being a bit messed up. Either way, this should be weak. I don't know if I want to see Mario 64 base game. I want the star. It would be very cool to see, but I understand if they just want to stick with it until they're ranking. Yeah, I'm not remaking all of Mario 64 with the star. That's so much work. Like, holy shit. What do you say? Fuck like that? What do you mean? I always say fuck like that. So. Okay, do you see this weird blue color here? Why is there so much blue who invited all those blue Same there so much blue All right, what else needs to be changed Uh easier they don't have any fuck This here has no phone There'll be a random of dynamic lighting I don't think so So Are there any set for comments I'm not sure what to do about this here where it's like flickering Did I just remove that part before that doesn't seem right to me either And everything looks so amazing you and buy back in a perfect game Then we do also nice bargain free zone spread him and go through the roof. I have excluded skilled in color theory. Yep He probably knows the real color theory and not the the wrong one If you know what I mean It looks like something is multiplying all the colors with blue for some reason So I removed these i'm not sure what I removed You see how the lighting on mario is like not normal Yeah, exactly because you didn't study color theory had you done that maybe your thing would be worse because probably is fucking stupid Oh, yeah, green is the opposite of red sure dude green is the opposite of red fuck you I'm very passionate about this one Colors that are huge shifted 180 degrees work well together. Yeah. Sure. I enjoy your fucking Yellow and purple sure that's gonna look good Okay, I know the irony of me saying this while I have an orange and pink level but like It makes sense. Trust me Yellow and purple true no, but have you ever looked at I mean, uh, how is that together? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know Dude I hate this They say it's like the opposites of this And wait, this isn't even the right hue wheel This isn't even the right one They don't even agree on on this This is says yellow and purple and this one says yellow and blue And then here it's pink and not purple, what is this Red green It's luigi red and green he is not red and green Isn't he blue and green? Yeah, but they go like we try tone colors, for example They always just go like oh, yeah pick these three colors and just put them together and then we'll look good No, that's not how it works The point of what you're making is not to just Pick random colors the point of what you're making is do you think of an emotion and then you think about how you can use? The tools in your arsenal to evoke this emotion This feeling you know, you know, you're just you know, you're just you're just you're just you're just you're just You know That's how I think about it Red and green is christmas You were yapping like a little kid at the brother a year ago when you learn how everyone radek is No, even back then I was saying I hate it It was just like random stuff someone made up at some point and then they were like, yep. Yep. Sounds good. This is science now That's not how it works Um, okay, why are these malfunctioning I think there might be something somewhere setting Kalas for this The fuck still I can't figure out why this one would do this oh that's probably what was going on you left these here and I'm not sure if that was on purpose in that case I'll apply all the visible ones and delete all the invisible ones because then you will get what you saw in the blender viewport okay what I don't like about color theory is really just that they postulate stuff without actually doing any proving on anything like it's not empirical or reason or anything it's just randomly made up you know those woman things that are like here is a crystal and this is your star sign now and this crystal can heal your tummy ache that that's what it feels like to me don't apply to remove them but then you won't get what's in the viewport I think it changed anyway it didn't change because I applied the ones that were visible and removed the ones that were invisible yeah so it keeps it exactly as it looks the game does hide some triangles based on your camera yeah like in this one you see those those four things here the cald east cald north cald south and so on these are called depending on what your camera view is of course we can't do it as much as in crash bandicoot because crash bandicoot has linear levels okay there we go oh yeah hell yeah this is what Biobak wanted mostly still a few render issues but mostly it's looking good what's wrong here oh the fuck thing's missing interesting again fuck random aren't missing what if I just sent this to v color fuck like yeah it's for color theory okay let's see what you posted here it's not loading please use a reputable website like pastebin if I don't want to click bad things why is this a cut out okay I think we might be mostly done with the main area now the fake reflection on the metal cans it looks really good doesn't it I mean it's always trying looking on looks like changing comparing improving you need to have like zero talent for visuals at all the only way I can do visuals is like mostly through like rational thinking and computation I can't just wipe it out it doesn't work for me we're also coming to you for your color combination ideas the pure golden combo was your idea from the get-go yeah true I guess but again the idea was like I wanted to create a mood and I knew rationally like how to do it and then I just cannot edit zero talent evolved just like learning which is why I will never be like an amazing 3d artist I will always just be at the best averaged or like slightly above average it is what it is check the essence if you've got time to but even a lot of bonding there's some good ones in there all right we will do that in a bit we'll definitely have to have to make a new collision map for one yes something's still amiss the background and the the feeling doesn't really change that goes on my to-do list area one we've got a job semi-secured true one day after rty we will absolutely just turn this into like a proper game company and we will make so much money it's the most gamecube looking map you've made so far it does look insane this is also now the map that ran the worst although with biomex changes it probably runs a lot better now wait what okay this goes on my list uh do not update mario's safe position when hanging on the bench this is an interesting soft block you can replicate it well these are things that would be found during bug testing anyway so it's not not that big of a worry all right let's see what we've got for assets and it's around bear weights factory classified one this was the old one this is the new one yes okay thank you for putting them side by side just so all of us know that the new one is better very nice of you looks pretty good to me look at this he triggered a silicone bug can you believe this there i fixed the silicone bug maybe i should send you my presets because this happens quite a bit if Lilaa could tell me where they're stored i would send them to you this link works for you or a local file you can just upload it to imgur too if you want yes chicken gunner that's the idea sorry guys i read youtube chat wait a little i should be catching up more yeah the dizzy effect is very nice i like it a lot it's because i'm messing with the actual viewport matrix which is something probably kind of unique in games i didn't want to mess with the armature so i'll let you do the merge i mean this is no longer an armature right this can now be an object so we don't actually have to worry about the armature any plans to make mario's middle position be synced to the dizzy effect it is old version has a scale command new version doesn't need it it's at scale oh yeah but that's in the in the behavior the scale command in the behavior is a hundred percent free doesn't cost anything so that's fine yes i know of this xcrc and i hate this i think this is just bullshit this is this is not colors that go well together also again green is not the opposite of red what's this even mean this is like this is also missing monochromatic but monochromatic if it's like good if you want to make something feel monotonous or like like solitude you know or like complementary as you want to make something feel alive you know it's not just pick these colors that actually look good together also tetradic at that point like you're just making rainbow road don't worry biobike we do not hate on flexes here in fact i was planning to maybe make a video a huge emotional rant about why more people should be flexers why being humble sucks and is stupid see i think okay this is my personal theory i think a lot of people act humble because they want to avoid conflict not because they actually are humble and i think acting humble is not valuable at all i think what's really valuable is being willing to change your mind and sure acting humble is correlated with that but it is not like a perfect predictor so if you are someone who is willing to change their mind but you don't act humble then you don't need to like it's pointless like what's the point of acting humble just like be willing to change your mind you know what i mean all right i would actually go so far as to say that acting humble is a coward's tactic i am taking it that far oh no he triggered the silicon bug again let me just fix that real quick what could be flexing the same thing as self-evaluating see there's this thing i don't know scrimbler's i don't know how the guy is called saying if you go on the internet and you have a question don't ask a question say the wrong thing and let people connect you correct you so if you just go and say you're the best and you let people correct you and they're like you're not the best you messed this thing up you can be like oh i messed this thing up i can improve from this and get better you know just f**k it that's a brandolini slur of course a brandolini i will correct you and that's good i want people to try and correct me i want you to walk around in the factory office and underground section for the new visuals please you know what that's actually a good point let me just finish the factory visuals real quick and then we check those out uh wait elevator also i wasn't arguing i was just ranting into the void there was no one to argue against i bet this also has the silicone bug it does but we cannot fix it looks good though wouldn't this kill the scrolling kind of i guess not entirely yeah that's run cooper.blend he uses run hamsterware for full speed default and action mark 2 for stonewalking when you talk to him a set team mod Oh, okay. No, man, you haven't written to write right here Made your own anem. Okay. All right. I will use that then I'm not promoting shit. I Could make a probably recreate my 64 runs of me well from area All right, let's look at the level then see what the areas look like Yes, if you disable interpolation and animations that will save some performance and but then the game is running at 30 FPS so Or the animations are rendering in 30 FPS. So like what are you saving the perfor? Let's take a look at the office Dude this for some reason this looks so unreal. This is just me the way that the window looks Okay We have to do something about the piranha plants this should not just be in the corners Or did you want to get rid of the Biobak? I really like the piranha plants, you know, I Think they're extremely cute-looking and very fitting for Mario for both his office  Great keep and relocate them. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, too What is going on here Ah, why is it zooming out so far You You just added one cylinder here What the hell Why is there a single cylinder here Two cylinders inside each other very small ones That must have been an accident someone must have slipped on their mouse I Am a master. What does that do? Let me check that This one here I don't see a difference to be honest. Oh, maybe maybe it looks a little more 3d That's weird He was not removed for performance reasons he was removed because he had no business existing there Dude if I preview this on the main channel people are gonna be so wild about this they're gonna be like holy shit how are they doing this I still need to add the light here it's gonna make this even nicer looking Some other techniques oh that that Selena didn't have a good technique either they were not even doing the patented ace twist yep this is a Biobak rework oh well we definitely want to remove those flames Dude the light's so cool I'll definitely add a light coming from there too It's not just the textures that look good it's like the whole lighting conditions in this Okay let's try to go to the underground again Wait The entire texture is gone ah okay so it's gone if the area is being reloaded makes sense You're gonna hate me for the underground assets? Why? Oh there are so many special events happening there The UV on that mesh circle around the helipad is fucked up It's a little bendy yeah A little better like this Maybe kinda I think we can afford this whoops Doesn't it doesn't even really look better god damn it What if we do this this this this It's still not looking good I think it is what it is Let's try to enter the factory maybe that works It's probably so low res because if you made just the HUD super high resolution and had the rest of the game still be low resolution it would probably be a lot better It would look really stupid Oh Oh I see some render issues there And here It's all good though There's no way I'm gonna make this I'm gonna die Oh yeah this looks nice That's kind of a difficult jump But I guess it's course 11 so that's fine Oh I think I should just remove these two emps here at the end they're kind of stupid World's slowest slide yeah it's not set to slip rate very easy fix Should make it in the unused bad enemies unused stuff I don't think I was kind of thinking about making a video about all the unused things in Mario 64 that I left in the ROM Okay Biobak why does this need to be animated like manually why don't we just use a texture scroll here or is that what your idea was So Oh clearly not like that what the fuck Scroll text one oh okay Got it Level looks so noob yep it does look pretty insane Move to uv oh I see  All right let's see what else we have here underground asset New arcadia prism change prim alpha according to extent percent  Oh god no Biobak why did you do this to me Ah Explain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 he wants me to import 11 versions of this So that every single one of the 11 versions can have unique uvs uh vertex colors Has multiple variants so the lighting doesn't look off only v colors change so you might want to store vertex data only instead of 11 different versions of the objects see the problem is Yeah yeah yeah no I know what you mean here it's doable Just copy the vertex colors as vperms Doesn't work No don't worry this is doable it's just gonna be annoying to do What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna import one of them And then I'm gonna have an atom switches for each individual one I Spotted in the room are an asset underground hydraulics order.png They're already going so no need to rotate the objects I think okay This oil Uh, there's a lot fewer points to prim orange change from alpha when it's crucial to turn into a puddle of oil Okay So far I'm not sure what I think of this You don't want them turning yellow like in 3d world I thought it looked cool Fade the texture away when he squishes Assuming that these guys are not ground poundable We could make it so that if you ground pound them they turn into oil right away, let's do that Which one starts Make it so that if you step on this oil they turn into a puddle. It's the main question mark The only thing is I like to yeah. Yeah, that's true. I like the snow. No, this is good. I think this is good change Shape seems better to Our assets Elevator doors should move with the elevators on only when the elevator is at full stop. Okay. Yeah, we can do that That's a nice elevator Do you not have the elevator chef maybe oh, all right That looks nice There should be an elevator cam because it's awkward in there perhaps elevator music even Yeah That could kind of work Let me let me add a note for that Which area is this two, yep Area two Elevator music inside elevator And special cam in elevator You must be pretty off and stuff on the hydraulic platforms, oh I thought you were talking about the other thing But yes, you're right. I missed that So, let's see what this is about No, what's this and then Oh that makes so much sense this looks like it has more depth than this because they're extending You guys get the idea While they while they go larger this happens. So it looks like they actually extend it like an accordion Oh, that's a really cool idea All right, what's next Elevator has been changed trying to fit better There's now a gap for the doors to move with the cabin When the floor of the cabin is snapped to the floor of the building the opening fits perfectly with the hole in the wall With the top and bottom parts thicker purely for aesthetics. All right Yeah, this looks pretty nice cables for realism All right, you're gonna see the cables Plant is now more fitting and chilling Ah, yeah, that like the lighting is more fitting. Yeah, I agree Boss assets, let's see that part Sinking platforms have a new look. Okay. Yeah fits the new layout a lot better All wave has been simplified plus new orange glow. So it is more Visible Okay, yeah it fits the boss as well Let's see what we have to run a main area I don't think I have the main area assets here Yeah, i'm missing those while back Play animation. Um, I think oh I tried to play the animation but of course Wrong hotkey Oh, I see so they're no longer biting I'm fine with them not biting not like that was a huge gameplay implication anyway They bit without damaging you or they were supposed to be damaging you that must have been a bug To add all the mega scry babies you should one day have a polling site that make people click yes on my content They want you to add from listed stuff No, i'm not letting anyone else decide what I put into my games What the people want is terrible I do not believe in democracy You're so real for that case, thank you Arthur I Genuinely believe me making every single decision ever is better than democracy for everyone involved, especially me That comment under your last video about peach What was that I don't remember this Yeah After experiencing mario builder center since I agree 100% yeah Anyone who had to deal with a lot of people trying to make decisions would know So Okay, I think once stream is over what i'm gonna do is just do the collision map for this Because this level is so cool. I want to showcase it on my main channel Uh, but I also want to do the camera thing on my main channel with the demo release I should do this level first Because that's gonna make people more hype for the demo and then I do the demo thing like two weeks after or maybe three For the other than brine Unless there's a really skilled head chef that makes all the decisions and tells the cooks what to do And they listen This is what demo release i'm thinking of releasing a new demo of just course one To get more feedback on camera and mario physics I'm gonna release it along with like a google documents Where people can get feedback on what they like and didn't like about like the way mario controls and stuff The idea would be that I get a lot of playtest data to tweak all the little variables so that everything's perfect What Was it This one here Seems good to me Or you may be confused when I landed it was weird, you're right It's like it has a frame of delay I think it's because I updated the order Of things Oh Let's check that out real quick I can't change the order of events in a frame. So that's probably why Huh What is mario updates So I'll be james player After poll like No, that should be fine. I don't know what's going on there. That's not good Yeah, it seems to Oh, right. Yeah, it applies to displacement Oh, but it has to do that because mario's Collision point is not going to be valid. Otherwise, right? Oh, but I have to back up surface here What if I just say fuck it let's see what happens Hmm Oh, yeah, very very much has changed since peter's theory it's a lot better now Most of the complaints on only up 64 were about like The actual geometry of the level just being so bad that it had like collision issues and people were blaming the engine So Okay, let's get rid of the delay but there's still like a weird inertia thing going on here  Um Hmm What other area can we check out so we have area one here area two there area three area four downstairs Area six. Oh, but to go to area six. We have to go through the area that crashes So because one area crashes right now, we can't really check out everything unfortunately Um, okay What I will do is I will try to fix the collision map here And then I will try to fix the crash and then I will update some of the objects And unfortunately, i'm gonna do this off stream Which means I will see you guys next week And look forward to the course 11 video hopefully and the First one demo re-release or something. I don't know Until then. Bye. Bye
