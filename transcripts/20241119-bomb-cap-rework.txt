It's it's family's it's it's it's that and the competitive  am  in  and fifth and fifth of an 810 as music and soft one and no taste buds no earbuds no I don't know fuck you okay we need bio back here because we forgot to include the textures unless these are not required we are listening to frenchcore today because I want to hello Biobak Biobak there's textures missing in the factorycanon.blend file today is a frenchcore stream I just want to it just feels good to listen to you know hello teatime what are you saying I said what the song said but I wasn't listening the guy said that? awesome send a texture to you alright wait I got a ping it's a work ping hell no I'm off that's the wrong texture is that the right texture? okay I see makes sense yeah this song is kinda cringe not gonna lie let's just go to the next one you have another resus cap for me? very nice I will enjoy this at a later date looks good to me I can still hear you a little? oh sorry about that when is the next guest to our real character stream? I don't know I don't know I don't know if I feel ready for another Tario stream I'm gonna wait for the next guest why does listening to loud frenchcore feel so good why can't I just do that on stream yeah Youtube always has a gigantic delay for some reason it's kinda annoying yeah I think your first mistake was watching the game over once who cares about fucking ads like come on that's on you oh oh cause you gotta bore Wade I wanna make a change to the stage that bokwang doesn't spawn if you've already got the cap I did this stream before with course 15 and I guess you missed that ah, that's how you get to these coins the multex just still messed up, what's wrong with it oh, I see I think it's supposed to be this alright, yeah, I just made it twice as bad, but it should fix it pumpkin rework, yes wait, wait, wait, everyone, nevermind I'm gonna move this to my second screen I wanna show you guys this, cause it looks so cool I want you to have the full experience this is a vibe, isn't it? look at this, it's so cool I'm definitely gonna add a looping alarm sound to this cannons look perfect, yeah, yeah it's a fast 64, but oh, you wanted that for the music, I see I was just gonna make it a sound effect I mean, it works in the music or as a sound effect, it doesn't really matter the modems spawn too high now, I guess they always tend to 4-7-2 makes sense as a sound effect, I think, cause it's dynamically positioned yeah, I'm gonna have to move the position dynamically now, so let's see what the fuck was I doing here? what number is this? 4-3-5-D? 4-3-5-D, that is... 375? thank you for the million cheers, what just happened? 4-3-5-D, let's see what that really is I set 370? that was really bad oh, how was it that far off? dang it wasn't a mistake, it was just goofy it's a really silly optimization I did there, it seems like not even half a microsecond, it makes the code harder to read okay, nice and then there's a snoo in the engine that you need to do this this song is nasty I don't like that you didn't know? well, I forgive you any OST wishes for today? does it sound anything like what just came on? cause what just came on was disgusting I am genuinely repulsed by it pigment free OST, let's do it just making sure it's important, right? ooh, that looks sick, doesn't it? just need some render radius I don't like this 270 sucks, so far it does I'm just gonna move on to the next song wait, this is 15 minutes long? alright, let's see how this goes hello dawn of the dead welcome to the stream oh, that's the new king bob-omb, he looks kinda nutty let me just make sure I understand this right yup, that is what I almost expected that's nice yes, well, the gears right now obviously have a huge bug with one of them rotating on the wrong axis that's his eye texture? nice let's play that again  Did I do that on the previous material? I just closed something important and I forgot what it was. I have a special video stored, okay, I won't save it. Ah, yeah, okay, this effect was lost, so there was an effect on his body that his body would blink, like when you hit him, he would go orange. So that doesn't exist anymore, it would set his primitive color, which I guess it still How can I restore this without ruining everything? Not to make him die in one hit. Yeah. Do we want that though? I can restore the effect, I'm pretty sure. Mr. Magnus, probably, I think this would work. Hmm, yeah, I see what you mean. I'm also not sure how this works. Eh. Fuck, I don't want to make him die in one hit, I don't care. Wait, is this him dying at the end? Oh, that is when he dies at the very end. I can change it to 1, but I don't want to lose the effect. Yes, the idea is that he doesn't spawn if you have the bomb cap unlocked, and he dies permanently. Nope, he doesn't need any new animations, he's good as is. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. What I could do is I should set this color here to orange when he explodes, just like this, which I think still has a nice effect to it. That's pretty crazy, that you handmade all of this. Hmm, hmm, hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm. That's not it. Bro, do I really have to figure out which one it is from the- oh, it's this one. This sucks. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Fuck. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There we go. This should be his explosion color if you ask me. Hmm, hmm. That should do it, and then I need to make him die in one hit. Alright, let's check it out. How old am I? 14, 29. What do you think of old iOS versions? I mean, I was gonna say I never owned an iPhone in my life, but I actually do have an iPhone, but I never used it. Android beta. How about mobile phone stinky? I'm already a level beyond Android beta. I'm on mobile phone stinky. Somehow, his feet look wrong to me. Oh, that looks brutal. Oh, this is also something I added just now recently. Why am I giving wouldn't know this, but I added this wall here. The wall comes up as soon as you press the switch, right? So in the end, you're just gonna have to break the wall. Should be free. No, we just reduced it to one just now. Just because. Isn't really a point to it being free, and I don't think it's very fun face of the fight anyway. There is a box in this room. Wait, there's no box in the room after this is what you mean. In which case, fair enough. I misunderstood you.  I absolutely have to add one. There we go. Bomb kept power up saving any additional aim left. I mean, most of Mario's physics are still intact. They just improved. Yes, we're so close to Twitter monetization. I just need to respond to like two or three more tweets and then we're good. Which is so stupid. I can make high quality posts. It doesn't matter. I go to one famous people famous page on the homepage and I post guys. I have Twitter blue and I get like 300,000 views. That's like probably like $3 just for saying I have Twitter blue. It does pay for itself. This is a tragedy. Next Wednesday is. The big one. Everyone's waiting for. Jet stream. You know what I mean? Wave race. Popularity in a nutshell. I don't think it's popularity. I think that's just the Twitter environment. It's the people that post and browse on Twitter that causes actually, it's the people that browse on Twitter. I blame all of humanity for this. And actually also the Twitter algorithm. That's really not a big deal. You just have to use it correctly. Oh, I see. The idea is that it's the floor going up here. Yes, this music is driving me insane. This just sounds like someone hitting random keys on Xylophone. This is not good music. Fuck whoever composed this. I want something else. Please take me out of here. We're listening to Eurobeat. 617. I'm making clean by the way. That's why it takes a little bit right now. You're going to destroy my life. All right. Looks good. I did change the death animation a little bit, so I want to make sure that looks fine too. Nice. He turned orange. All right, that looks very good. Let me look at the animation again. Next place looks a bit cheap. Really? The new demo will be released whenever the video for it is ready at this point. I'm basically done with it, but there is one video I'm going to release like Saturday. There's another video my editor has yet to start on. Then there is a video about the missing link that I'm planning for December 14th. And then after that I can release the demo, which I guess might be December 28th or something. Hello, dumb bitch. And I mean Holly, not Lilaa this time. God, I'm evil. I saw Lilaa is finally back. I thought she died. I'm very glad she's not dead. Hello, Dimension. Hello, Askel. 1170. Hello. Do you believe that our body organs have like a cache and buffer where they can store data before you like process this? Because like sometimes you hear something or you see someone say something and like you don't process it until like later. And then you like realize what they said. You know what I mean? And I kind of do that with numbers here. Like I say them out loud and I store them in my ear buffer and then I process it so that like the information is in my brain without me having to remember the information because I like stored in my ear buffer. Am I crazy? No, I'm just dumb. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.  Oh. I block. I don't think I've ever been like called dumb in the last 15 years or so and like actually taken it personally. I was like, OK, clearly this person doesn't know me. I guess that's one of the benefits of having literally infinite ego. Oh, I called you socially dumb. I think that'd be wrong too Dumb is just a bit of something as I know I'm smart factually wrong Interesting take You can make clean here I Am a genius If you guys seen recently this guy pop up Chris Langham it's like the most intelligent man in the world with like an IQ of 210 or something and He's telling people like how to think and this theory of everything That is like genius verified genius verified by himself Hello Nina any TP dude congratulations I Listen to your beat why did this activate so early? It's not supposed to activate just yet That's a problem Did I introduce this book Ha I don't think I did I Don't make me switch my phone number and it seems to be really hard. I don't see the hack No, I would absolutely hardly not just think of this as like a virtual one Why did you have to switch your phone number though, like why does it why does your mom care about your phone number? What are you up to the biomex rework of the stage shoot I Like what's she like, oh you're getting SIM card is nice that and your brothers give it to your brother You don't matter. Was it like something like that? I don't understand how this makes any sense Damn Well, I have Holly I don't even have a phone plan People always so surprised to hear that. They're like why you never phone plan is again. I don't go outside What do I need a phone for? Bom-bomb breakers firewire and spinning areas that I'm ready said power parts of that. I love it. I was hitting at a star short We have the right cognition kind of like that I Don't get entirely health can I move to on that? I don't know how you go to service, Canada and You apply for a health card, I think it goes like 50 bucks. I Don't know if that's true, by the way, I might be hallucinating this together. I am a large language learning model after all I What opened the gates No, what starts at the mission? Wait, those are two separate issues wait, wait, wait wait, wait, wait I Yeah, I was you're thinking about one status and then I just came to the conclusion Actually didn't even like consciously decide to ignore it I just unconsciously ignored you and you know what I mean I Case knows about every kind of systems out. I've never tried something sports. Fana. I'm not gonna do it. Just curious. I have I Why would I notice you're crazy Open gates and for Ah It has to be this right I am so confused By the way, okay, this is one of the stages that has like one very expendable thing going on and that is the idea that You have to be the server once forwards and once backwards and I did beat it backwards earlier and I think it's really fun To beat this stage backwards as well Because like all the obstacles may kind of work for you that way And it changes the vibe a lot. I think it's like an interesting thing to experience Okay So it is this G Mario state post to this we get an 1 4 6 5 0 Doesn't make any sense It is clearly not bigger than 1 4 6 5 0 Should make a push Mario before damage now making a push Mario could be interesting More damage maybe I Think maybe it's true that it's like not visually striking enough to like the obvious See whenever I need a phone I just use a nose phone I What if I take this out If this is like a change I made recently and it doesn't make any sense that this would break it, but maybe this is it It doesn't compile I Think this is like the third version of that song No I'm actually thinking what likely happens on this game is that I'll be done with most of it Before my like is done with like the reworks. I mean obviously Because like I have a giant head start and he has a lot of work So likely what I'll do in that time is Improve the visual fidelity of things hopefully So I'll be adding VFX SFX stuff like that Okay, so this passes the BPM tune equals 16 check for some reason. I don't see how this makes any sense Wait Is it this it has to be this What is John J is garbage coat Look at this. Why is she doing that? Look at what? I Honestly, that's not even the worst I've seen someone to come from respond to compliments the worst I've ever seen some response or compliment was myself So There were people I wanted absolutely nothing to do with and like my local friend group And I barely knew them and I think they wanted to like connect to me So they're like they made like a compliment like wow, you got so big you've been working out a lot So it's like yeah, I know everyone's telling me that it's kind of annoying to get it all It's like on purpose you just pick the wrongest dialogue option I love doing that I Miss this room. That's the room where you get fucked I Think the MX takes that much time. No, but there's a lot of stuff I can polish up Easter eggs. I can add stuff like that I Shouldn't have done in sm65 Do you think skill in your would be upset if I released as a Super Mario 65? So I don't get fucked Because when you do this room for the first time, there is not gonna be a bomb kept here to stand on So you will have to run away from the bombs Did you guys see the new skill in your video Wait This is so funny, I Think you were gone while this was happening me now so He released a video called ace Emanuel. Maybe a criminal and then people were hating it and Like a few days afterwards. He renamed it It's It's so funny my favorite response to this was Fasana saying grooming miners is a crime also You're not gone like ever oh, I thought you were out for a few days Why did mr. Common give a real response it's chat GPT Am I missing any actors, I don't think so. I think I have all of them in now except for the pipe at the end When you put more videos like the money brushwoods analysis, yes, I will definitely be uploading a course to analysis wait buy a bike Do you know which level you want to do next? This is going to affect my decisions in life I Trouble the 15-hour video I think every single leader of the game inspiring the shit out before he comes out. I Mean, okay my idea when I upload videos to case clips Is that the amount of people watching it is going to be so much lower than the amount of people playing the game? So it doesn't really matter Jet GPT thinks every Romic was made by me I Will you joke very obviously seems to point fun at the concept of Analyzing content before it's released. So I feel like I had to give a real rebuttal Oh Half an increase is so for that Damages randomly sweats, you know, that sounds like yet the pizza's maybe For panic attacks Diabetes or panic attacks When you say bomb come do you mean like there's a new power-up in the game that uses bombs or like a cap limit on bombs There is a bomb cap that you can use to spawn bombs. You know, if they beat us Okay I will believe you It's hidden my blood You'd smell it in your piss if your piss smells sweet then you probably have diabetes I think that's how you do it And yes, you would definitely see them but to actually if you had a dog work done And they were checking for insulin or glucose I cannot freak off Actually, I could probably do it Get blood on free actually, yeah, that makes sense. Of course you get blood the final time then that's kind of OP You've committed the meds not like you're cured you don't need to take the meds anymore you just quit them I'm not neurodivergent. I'm not the imposter. I Didn't secretly eat sugar It's like normal I'm referencing Johnny Johnny Yes papa, eating sugar, no papa, open your mouth, ha ha ha ha. This is not where I wanted this to be. Yes papa, eating sugar, no papa, open your mouth, ha ha ha ha. Yes papa, eating sugar, no papa, open your mouth, ha ha ha ha. Yes papa, eating sugar, no papa, open your mouth, ha ha ha ha. Yes papa, eating sugar, no papa, open your mouth, ha ha ha ha.  Yes papa, eating sugar, no papa, open your mouth, ha ha ha ha. Yes papa, eating sugar, no papa, open your mouth, ha ha ha ha. Yes papa, eating sugar, no papa, open your mouth, ha ha ha ha. Yes papa, eating sugar, no papa, open your mouth, ha ha ha ha. This looks good to me. Somehow you're like the last person I expected to brag about the big penis. I don't know why. Oh god, what's with all these warps? Who added a million warps to my scene? I think it was me. Okay, I think it'd be easier to count the people that don't have ADHD or autism than the other way around in this chat, because we are a niche modding community. Oh god, what's with all these warps? Who's rebooting us ADHD? That's the first I've heard of that one. Taking vitamin D is very important, especially like during winter. Even if you go outside a lot, I think vitamin D in winter is valuable. Okay, that was awful. 120 seems good. 120 also seems good. Someone just said Schrödinger with the umlaut, I think he's not English. I'm literally German, of course I'm gonna say Schrödinger. That's his name. You think I'm gonna mispronounce his name on purpose? I can't pronounce the name, you mad? Okay, I think the camera angle should be slightly different. Like something like this. Well, T10 might also be German. Well, obviously I am not normal. I shouldn't just be sus, you should just assume guilty. I am like optimizing a 28 year old video game right now online for you. I am not autistic. I know it's hard to believe, but I swear I'm not. You sound like me, I would never sound like you. I think I'm gonna do this. Just because it's gonna look better if the thing ever peeks out. Do umlauts scare you? Umlauts. Do an autism test. If you have 20.000 points, you can request BuzzFeed Quiz. And I will do an autism test, if you request it. You will request it right now, you have to find a test tool. Did someone just request it? Alright. Alright, if we are doing an autism test live on stream, we have to find a good song for that. Um... And what's more fitting than Sonic Adventure music for an autism test? Alright, let's do the test. 10 to 30 minutes? I'm gonna speedrun this. Have you seen my live rehearsal? Um... True? Well... True only now, I would say. Because I was definitely not sympathetic before 16. Nope. No, when I'm an asshole. Also not true. I don't know, it's actually never true. I mean, I misbehave, but like, I know I misbehave against a good purpose. I give it myself and other people choose. Uh...  Actually, maybe only when I was older. The environment I'm in has always been, like, the apple of my eye. Uh... I think that's always been true. Generally when I show my special interest. Yeah, that is true. Because, like, otherwise, what the fuck am I gonna talk about? Nope. Shit. This is true, unfortunately. From this friend or family. We've been apart for a long time. Not really. That's what I'm thinking, even if I don't mean to. I mean, that's true, but like, that's whatever. Everyone offends other people, like, what they're thinking, right? No one just says it. Like, you don't just go to your mom, like, Oh, mom, you look fat today. Because, like, that's offensive. This is a stupid question. Oh, everyone has to say yes to this. Because everyone's thoughts are offensive. I like to think and talk about a few things that interest me. Uh... Yeah, honestly. I think it's odd to eat in a restaurant by myself than with someone I know. I've never been in a restaurant by myself. Definitely not. No, you don't think your thoughts are offensive to other people? Like, not even an hour ago you said your mom was being an asshole. If you told your mom that you think she was being an asshole, she would be offended. Okay, yes. It is more important than how they look. Because I don't give a fuck how I look. I guess I have to say yes here, too. No, I have to act normal to please other people and make them like me. This is true. I mean, I just generally do not really care. So, no. Nope. Nope.  Yeah, like pudding with chunks. Actually, but that's like eating. No, not really. Not extremely. I have never wanted to or needed to have another girl come into a relationship. Nope. I think so. No. No, I'm actually really good with that. Like, when someone takes a fork and scratches their table, their plate, or like chalk on the chalkboard, it doesn't bother me. Yeah. I am an understanding type of person. I am understanding. I just often don't care. I do not care what characters in my movie feel like. They feel very true. Dude, all movie characters are stupid. Tell me when someone is flirting with me. No. I can't see in my mind the exact detail of the things that I'm interested in. No, I have poor visualization. I see everything like in grayscale and like in 3D space. It's like idea blocks. Keep lists of things that interest me even when they have no practical use. For example, sports statistics, race scores, candidates, and dates. No. I mean, I guess you could argue optimizing Mario 64 has no practical use. But like, that is the end goal. So like, this is an instrumental goal. It's not just a random goal. Nope. Sure. Nope.     Actually. Eh. I don't really like it. So maybe not. Maybe true only now. Yes, actually. I've been told that I have an unusual voice. For example, loud monitors, childish or high-pitched. I mean, many people have talked about my voice, obviously, because I'm a creator online.  Sometimes a thought or subject gets stuck in my mind and I have to talk about it even if no one is interested. No. I do certain things with my hands over and over, like flapping. No. I don't think so. A little bit interesting, but most people I don't consider interesting. True. I consider myself a commercial type of person. Nope. Can I always be able to be well? Maybe following a set of specific rules to help me look normal? No. Is it hard for me to work in functioning groups? No. When I'm talking to someone, is it hard to change the subject they are listening to? No. Should I cover my ears to block out painful noises? No. Can chat and make small talk with people? Nope. Sometimes it seems that I should be able to be well as far as I can, so that I help myself with my writing. No. When I talk to someone, I have a hard time telling them when it is my turn to talk. No. True. True. I always speak in a normal voice. They don't even notice my noise.   I don't rock on the chair when I'm feeling stressed. No. The phrase, he wears a tie on his sleeve doesn't make sense to me. No. When I'm in a place where there are many smell sections to feel noise, I feel anxious or frightened. No. Someone says one thing that means something else. Yes. To be myself as much as I can. Yes. I keep my thoughts stacked primarily like they are. I'm finding cats and I pick out the ones by looking through the stack and finding the right one. No. No. Eating time.  I can turn on things I dislike. Eh? I did not. I'm reading all these questions by myself. I can turn on things I dislike. Sure. I don't like to be hard to help. Yes. When I go somewhere I have to follow someone or I get very confused and upset. No. No. No. No. I'm often told that I ask embarrassing questions. Not really. I tend to point out other people's mistakes. Sure. The score? It doesn't say anything. Oh wait. All scores of 65 or higher indicate autistic traits. Do I have the score? Okay. So I am not autistic at all except in social relatedness. I have some autistic traits but likely not autistic. Okay. So I am autistic in one of four categories. Wait. The total is what counts? Shit. Okay. But it says at which it is considered. Alright. It says some non-autistics might score 90. Rigged test. Didn't get my scores right again. Hey. I would say I won this test. Okay. Only people with autism say that? Dang. I speedrunned the fuck out of the test though holy shit. You have a form of autism so specific it isn't even accounted for in the test. Yeah it's weird though right I got like four times of one thing in one category and like barely anything in the others. Is it annoying being autistic so badly don't be bullied. I don't think it would make a single difference for me whether I thought I was autistic or not. 10% world record on autism. I think this roughly checks out to me you're not like extremists or anything but you have a lot of traits that match yeah but I am I mean I'm obviously not neurotypical right I might just do something else that has some symptom overlap which I think is what's going on here. I am Jesus I am reincarnated okay this is end change junkies tick and color radius alright that's my next mission. The food text navigation shouldn't have counted for the texture question yeah I mean it probably did right it's probably like where my points in other categories came from but like pudding with chunks in it you know what I mean like not crunchy chunks but like jello chunks is like like that's normal right oh my god you're not gonna believe this you're not gonna believe this bio bag 8 manscaped sponsorship opportunity I can give you bald shaving heads in 4k on YouTube. I forgot the culling radius. Shaving my balls live on video for $2,000 what I can respond yes I'm interested I actually have very hairy balls and have given you razor for a while now. I might be stupid. Is it real or a scam it could be real it's difficult to tell with these you get a lot of these and the email address here is at afkcreators.com so I can look up what that is. It seems real I think it's real. Something that by people figuring out something isn't just true for everyone I don't mind I shaved a few microseconds of processing time speaking of shaving dude that's so good I gotta use that hello rocketman828 you know what we're missing the wall gears are the wall gears supposed to be the same as the normal gears bio bag or did you not make them or did I miss them I don't think I missed them. You removed them entirely there's still tons of them in the factory you wanted them gone they're gonna respond. We can have a 15 sub to sphere and add a disorderly man-scape to optimize my balls by removing all these unnecessary runnings and now everything runs extra smooth. There's many very stupid things we can do. So there is an issue with the camp switches here and that is that the color is red. We have four different ones. What the hell? Yeah, the camp switches are something we need to fix separately at some point. I'm not gonna do that right now. Wait the bombable wall Biobak, did you do that one? I'm actually pretty sure you didn't. Which, yeah, that's a very weird thing to work on. You can do something like that, I'm sure, like a dynamic texture. I didn't know it was the right one because I wanted to change the geometry, but also I need to learn how to redo that animation. Oh god, yeah, don't change the geometry, please. Is this how it works? Oh my god, oh my god, this is crazy. This is a crazy blender file. I think I have to change the texture slightly because these ones are kind of poopy. I'll probably update the texture then or something. It does feel very unfitting to me right now. I'll change the texture and the lighting. Why is it like this? Oh, I see, it has to be like that. But like, I can make a two cycle. I think I also kind of want to add a few cracks onto this, like deep seated cracks, just to make it look more inviting to vomit, I guess. Probably is already very inviting to vomit, but like just a little bit more. That looks like shit. That also looks terrible. Yeah, I can't really do the multiply by print. Actually, I guess I could do the multiply by print thing. Maybe I will do it after all. Shit. You keep convincing me to just put in way too much work. It didn't even say anything. I convinced myself after reading that again. Yeah. All right. Update one more material. One, lighting for a room. Two, lighting changes the weather in the individual brick. Yes, that's what I'll do. Hope to see you later when I get older. I still remember the smell of your perfume. It hasn't left me since the day you made me. Why does this guy want to have sex with me? Don't expect to see you here. I fucking love him. Hello. I've been streaming for years. I think I did it again. I made you believe we were more than just friends. Oh, baby. It might seem like a crush. But it doesn't mean that I'm serious. Because to lose all my senses. That is just so typically me. Oh, baby, baby. Do you know the name? We started work on our team. I don't know that they I know it was sometime in 2020. Or maybe the end of 2019. The hack I think most fun making. Maybe something stupid like Doki Doki Mario 64. True. Wait, if I make use of a grayscale texture here. And I multiply text one and text one. Then we can get a quadruple multiplication going. Where we use shade color or we use. Shade color multiplied by primitive color. Now what we can do is the primitive color can be the lighting in the room. So like in the red room, it would look like this. In another room it might look like this. And then we can decrease this when the brick goes further in. And we have normal lighting as well. I think that's an insane strategy. We get all the lighting effects. This was hard. There's supposed to be a box here that says add function nodes. The hell? Did it break? I don't know. I don't know.     Huh? I am losing it. Leela. The Octane Geo Layout Inspector is just missing. R64 is active. Mario 64 is not active. The whole Mario 64 tab is gone. Ah. Alright. I can definitely do this and I will do it. But honestly today I'm kind of feeling like a shorter stream. I might be back tomorrow. I'll probably finish this off stream. The issue is I have some stuff to do after the stream as well. I don't want to get ready for that. So today's stream is going to be ending a little earlier than usual. And I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye. Wait no. What's wrong Leela?
