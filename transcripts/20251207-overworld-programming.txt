Hello? Where is the stream gang? I think we have to finish the old Master Yoshi today. I think that's where we were stopping last time. Hello PikaPix222? Hello hello. Hello Iris Farina. Oh, you're the same person that I saw on Discord, right? Same profile picture? You are testing the current Course 11? Very nice. Welcome to the stream. This rock is floating. I'm gonna rotate that as soon as I have the thing open. I'm currently working on improving Course 12. I found things that make it so much better. The first build was ass. I finished the Analog 3D video like two days ago by the way. I'm just waiting for a sponsor. I think we might actually be sponsored by Teemu because I'm desperate to find one as soon as possible. Think to us? Nice! Awesome. Don't worry about doing it super fast. I just need it like within the week or so, ideally. Problem is my previous tester flaked on me. We're supposed to test it like two weeks ago and they never did. Hello Clayman. Waiting for Blender to load. That's why I'm running around by the way. So I was reworking this level recently. There are some changes here. Okay, there's a lot of fast 64 bugs that make this very hard to see but don't worry about those. Oh, nice Kevin. That's good that it works. I only played it a little bit and yeah, it works on the Analog. We got this new section in Course 12. So basically my changes here made it so that it's easier to find the Derry Bar because it's very important that the player finds the Derry Bar. And here instead of a foggy transition through the outskirts, it's going to be a minecart that carries you there and the outskirts are way smaller. I love this part of the level. You know, these paths may only pour milk, nothing else partner. And this guy's playing a song. Hey partner, can this hold off on the laughter that hung down? Just enjoy the show. You're ruffling the spectators. And they all angrily look at you. Oh, it's so good. I love it. I still need to give this guy his text to hint at the secret door here. Waluigi's tackle stand worked fine, that's good. And yeah, there's some random bugs right now. If I zoom out far enough, the thing appears. That's a little silly. Anyway, I might blend off that a little bit so we can keep going on this. The lighting is awesome in the back, I like it too. When I actually got my analog first, my RomEx weren't working on it and I needed to update the OS first. So for a second after I got it, I was very worried that it's a very bad console, but fortunately it is decent. I don't believe this is the overworld. Well, we have finished part 1, we have finished part 2, we have finished part 3, we have finished part 4. We're right now finishing part 5, which is the biggest part. This one has the most going on and it's almost done. And I guess the Yoshi bar as well, which kind of can be done in part 6. And then we're still missing 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. So we're about halfway done. Well actually, I think we're more than halfway done because everything is already 3D modeled and we just need to program it. Howdy King Nick. I'm kind of feeling like we should listen to an OST today. Part 5 is the main village. That's where all the Yoshis live. Alright, let's make this spinning wall. Oh my god, I butchered your name, you'll have to live with that, I'm sorry. We work on an optimizer named RISC-V, so it would be cool to play RISC-V with CCAPS on OG hardware. For 1 million dollars, I would do it. For 1 million dollars, I'm giving you Mario 64 on the original N64 in full 60 FPS. But if you're lucky, you don't even have to spend a million dollars, because I'll probably RTYI is done, to re-import Mario 64 into the RTYI engine. So I think it's going to be the best Mario 64 I've ever made. I'm glad you look forward to it. I don't think that's right, Merrick. I think it's Yoshi T. Munchosaurus, Yoshi-saurus, something like that, Munchakoopas. Oh yeah, we can listen to Nintendo Christmas music. I need to do a survey, guys. Can you eat almonds? Do you guys have them where you live, and are they awesome? And again, can't eat almonds. I do not remember Hook Builder Koopa. And so does the Pac-Man. Oh, I see. Maybe this is basically the same thing. I'm writing a paper on the importance of derivative works such as role-making. I said Return to Yoshi's Island is an excellent example of this. Any thoughts on the value of role-making in general? How do you define value? For me to be able to answer your question, I need to know what you mean by value, I think. Hello, Lunar Festival. The Crackpipes and Beerbongs? Please don't. Role-making seems to me a supermarsk to flourish and grow in a way that just treating it as a fun product on brand-name does not. That's for sure true. I don't think Mario 64 in the current year would be as popular as it is without role-making. What did you guys think of the new video? You guys liked it? People really seem to like this video, it's doing pretty well. There's one comment I got that pissed me off, and people upvoted it. And I get this comment over and over, where it's like, if Kaze was working on Mario 64, they would have needed five more years, and it wouldn't have been worth it. And it's like, fucking no! I'm a pretty fast programmer. Have you played Super Mario Eclipse? No. I don't like Mario Sunshine. You didn't know it was me? Dang. But yes, that was me. I think the sponsor with the parenting cameo is Needs. All right, I forgot about that. The memoramics, I definitely see how flawed OG Gamers has been in terms of camera being ultra-annoying and input delay. Yeah, although, I'll be honest, I didn't improve input delay much in RTYI. In 60fps mode, I think the input lag is reduced by around, let me think about it, Mario 64 has around 110ms of input lag, or maybe 105. So I reduced the 5 part to maybe 1. So that's 101. And then at 60fps, we don't need a triple buffer, or well, we still triple buffer, but we triple buffer at 60fps. So I guess it went from 105 to 51ms of input lag at 60fps. I guess that's pretty good, actually. That is actually a lot. Nevermind, I take it back. I guess I'll reduce input lag a lot. What star ID did we give this? 8! And then this should be 1. Does this work? B parent 4 equals 99, okay, we can do that. Yeah, well, okay, Star Road doesn't have the Mario 64 camera really, because it's missing all the hard-coded camera stuff that Mario 64 does, but I would argue that all the hard-coded stuff Mario 64 does with the camera just kind of makes the game harder to play, except for like big bosons. Do you like plants? Do you like nuts, as in the plant and not testicles? Yes, I like nuts if we're talking about plants and food and not testicles. What do you think of modern series and languages? I think that anyone who cares what programming language they program in is a fucking loser and probably very bad at programming. I don't think it matters at all. Is this much better than this game experience? No idea. Oh, how cool is that? This looks awesome. This is awesome. I love it. The cutscene not ending is not awesome, though. That's a problem. Okay, so is it like Stierhoden? No, that doesn't sound very tasty to me. The thing about R6RGAM is that they could just not add so many things, so the redirection camera would be much better. I think parallel camera in all of R6RGAM... I kind of don't like parallel camera. I don't think it's good. I have been... This is something that a lot of the other modders complain about my mods, that I don't use parallel camera anywhere. I think parallel camera is too gamey, doesn't fit the world of the game, because it's suddenly aligned to 8-axis, but the real world is not aligned to 8-axis. I think it works for the Bowser levels, because they have just bizarre geometries, but for something like... I don't know, Jolly Roger Bay? I don't see it at all. I think a camera should be agnostic to the world axis. Oh, hello, Rionu. Parallel camera is a cop-out? Yeah, I think that's one way to look at it. Anyway, let's fix the cutscene. Cool. So it is not as simple as that. Where's the cutscene where you collect the star? Uh-huh. Oh, because there's no response. Why is there no... Right, there should be no text dialogue. Because course num. That should fix it. Parallel camera's movement is really slow? I think you're playing a different parallel camera than me. Parallel camera's movement is basically this. Can you dynamically change the axis depending on what area of the map you are? Yeah, but then you're doing more shit and they don't want that. I like this camera. You see how it follows Mario by doing the minimum rotation necessary to keep Mario rather centered? That fits very good to me. But then you can also press C left or so, and then it disables the auto-rotation, so it doesn't mess with you. Until it can enable the auto-rotation when Mario and the camera direction match up again, which happens if you move straight in the camera direction like that. I really like this camera. Can I add one move to the Ultra Mario 64 world with Wii? No. Wait, what happened? Weird. Oops, I fucking killed the old man. Okay, so the cutscene never ends. Really, this is the issue, right? Okay. While we're doing this, we should also already work at programming the hints for this old man Yoshi. You heard I was dead? I became a dad like one and a half years ago at this point. Ah, okay, so if you have a star, then he doesn't give you the intro anymore. That makes sense. Where does it determine the text ID? He should have a pop-up dialogue. Okay. I think this is a decent pop-up dialogue for him. So we have a pop-up dialogue system that's actually really easy to use. Let me show this to you. So, you just set the desired pop-up dialogue, and then you set it to 0 again. That's literally it. So, right here he talks to you, and then here he has the pop-up dialogue, where we just set it to 531. And then when you talk to him again, we just set it to 0. Which, I guess, that should happen here. Let me show you what it does now. It's so cool. We need to be convenient builds and start making convenient codes. See how he now already has the pop-up dialogue? That easy. Now it says, prove yourself above him. The text is not centered correctly. We need to fix that. And when I talk to him, the text disappears. Oh, and now it's back. That's an issue. I know why the text went back. This part. Let me check out why the pop-up dialogue is not centered correctly. Dialogue width is gotten here. And then we do a scale, and then we do a translation. That makes sense to me. It's what it looks like, Raymarge. But it's not. It's way more evil than that. Texture baked. Texture baked, yep. It's just two pixels, and we're using the texture filtering to get a gradient. Mario's texture in this game is just a fucked up mess of pixels. It doesn't resemble anything. Yeah. You know what? It's probably just minus dialogue width, now that I think about it. Is it beneficial with vertex attribute? Normals. You want normals on Mario. Which I guess with X3 we can have normals and vertex colors at the same time, but I'm not sure if that's more performative. I like the captions, that's good. Sorry, this might be important. Marty. Okay. Yeah, well it used to be an either-or situation. But it no longer is. Okay, so this is where we give the hint. Oh, wait. We sometimes use Yoshi text ID and sometimes Old Man text ID. Um. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Um. Was this on purpose? I don't think it was. And then, okay. This is where we want to inject. So we need to make a new structure that maps text IDs to a list of stars. Let's try that. And then text. Old Man. Hint. Okay. Okay, that's eight. Okay. So the first is obviously... This one here. This way around. And then his first text is going to be 541. Okay. Let's see, what's a fun way to put this? Okay. How do you think the way I'm going to continue might change? Hmm. Hmm. Maybe it would become more mainstream. Given that it would be more officially supported. How does RDI run on the analog 3D? Default mode, no overclocking. It runs way worse than on normal N64. With overclocking it just runs fine like it would on emulator. If COVID, it's so bad. Let's try another. Dude, my child is sick too. Hello Alec. Okay. And then the last start will be completely unobtainable. Something like... That's around 9255. Something like that, and then he will say I've taught you everything I know. Okay. Let's just have a different sound for that. A guy who serves... A guy who works on a head too says what? What? Oh no! Can you make like an inventory? Do you use Linux? What is an inventory? Is that a Linux term I'm unfamiliar with? I do read YouTube chat. I mean, it's funny because every asset I'm thinking about is in model files. I mean, what's the difference between a JSON file and just having that in source code? It's both just a text-based representation of what you're getting in the end. It's the same thing. Oops. Okay, that's also the wrong text. I love this fight so much. He doesn't change his animation, does he? Interesting. Don't ask me how I'm doing. I want to make candied almonds today. Wait, text 529? Okay, I see. Okay, I see. What happened? What? Paste the? What? Paste time. Okay. I think the old man might now be finished. That's completely wrong as well. What if you offset it by 0? That's not the old man god. That's the pop-up dialogue god. That's not good. Okay. So dividing it by 2 moved it too far left. Doing nothing moves it here. What if you just get desperate and divide it by 4 for some unforeseen reason that I don't understand? Could it be because we're scaling the text? But I think I'm scaling it by 8. Look at how evil this man is. Yes. I love this so much. You should only update to come back if you need more hints if there actually is a hint left. Okay. Okay. I think that's it. Let's see. Is there anything else missing? There's an old man in there. We have that. Hints on a specific order. We have that. The very first thing he gives you is a secret star in the dojo. We have that. We have this fire. We have this kick. Oh, he can only give you hints for overworlds you've entered before. We don't need that right now. Secret star is a big door. Textbox to find an area entry. Well, we basically have that. The only thing missing for part 5 is animated palm trees, but we don't do those. Let's see what else is there. I think it's time to move on to part 6 today. Part 12's entrance is a super happy tree seedling. I don't think I want to do that now. Oh, there's also the rainbow slide. The text for that. Okay. Right, I wanted to check that this text updates correctly. Talk to everything. Okay. This is the other secret star in here that I showed before. I kind of love how this works. I never verified that the cutscene ends properly now. It does not. That's a huge issue. Definitely need to fix that. Also, the pushing there is a little weird. Let's see. We should get a print here. We didn't get a print. There was no print. Interesting. I guess we're playing this cutscene here. Okay. I'm just going to write that down. There's a bug. Overworld star text seems to also not end the cutscene. So there's the order of the smoke versus the shadow. Wait. Let me see what you mean. Oh, that's what you mean. Is it the wrong order? It looks very wrong. But it shouldn't be. Oh, wait. Particles render. No particles render. Wait a second. Oh, I see. We render. No, that doesn't make any sense. Oh, thanks. Oh! The append to the buffer should be rendering above the shadows. That's weird. Yeah, yeah. No. The particles should be rendering on layer 5. And then the shadows on layer 6. No, wait. The other way around. Layer 6 is now transparent decals. I think that may still be a MRO-64 particle and that's why it's not fixed. No. That's probably what is going on. What passion... What... Profit-driven work really be that bad? I wouldn't mind if there were people that did this for profit. It wouldn't really affect me, right? It might make this a bigger thing. And in that sense I would also benefit from it. Would you be jealous just because someone else makes more money from it than you and then change the way you approach it even though you objectively benefit from it? That just sounds a little bit pathetic to me. ... ... ... ... ... Who said marketing was made for profit? False. It's a pure passion project. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I don't know. I don't... what? Why would I know about browsers? Oh, you're asking everyone, nevermind. All good. Just don't ask me. I've been sitting here like this multiple times. So any year after 2024 is the year of the ROMAC? Sounds good to me. I hope that when I make a game, I can make it very easy to mod, so that people can just go and make mods. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think we need something like that. Spoof this for now. I think we should make the race first. What? One fifth? A whole fifth? I don't think so. I mean, I'll be honest, I didn't make it, but I'll back that. So, maybe? But that sounds rather... impossible? Unlikely? I think we should be thinking about these races for a little bit. So, if we do make races, the races probably have to be like 30 seconds long. And they have to go from easy to medium to hard. And... I think we want them to be in stadiums that fill with more and more people. And have the Yoshis be like really hyped up, too. I think what we had in the Yoshi Garden thing was already great. So, I guess... What am I looking for? I'm looking for how to make the races interesting. 45, maybe 45. Hello, Biobank, what are we doing today? We just finished the Old Man and this thing. And now we're looking at the Athlete Yoshi. So, you remember the Athlete Yoshi idea was initially you'd spawn three times, and then you'd jump into the sky... and take you to the Rainbow Road, where there would be a slide? I was thinking about it more. I think it's kind of not great that way, actually. I feel like if we have an Athlete Yoshi, then he should also be rideable. So now I'm thinking... This guy's gotta be the Athlete Yoshi, he just says the I'm ready text. But instead he asks you to sponsor him, and then when you say yes, he actually takes you to the race with him. And you are on his back, and you have to race against maybe like seven other Yoshis for first place. And there are like 30 second races in a stadium with a bunch of people cheering the Yoshis on. They can be like 2D billboards. What do you think of that? And there would be three stars instead of just one, so each time you sponsor him, there's a different star. I think that can inflate our star count nicely too, because I think at this point we're at like 192. Findable Yoshi's a whore ass can of worms. I already have the goat from a different project. So that part is not an issue. Yes, yes, it's only the one area. He takes you to the stadium. My chocolate chunk cookies from Sketchy? That sounds awesome, yes. Okay, you think it's a good idea? You think it's better than the Rainbow Ride idea too? Because I'm pretty sure it is. But I think in that case, we should either do this later, or do the stadium first. Third race, obstacle race, extra round obstacle race. They will definitely have to get harder each time. Ladd race sounds a little boring, but it will be an easy race. The less money getting, we have the better. Well, money needs to do something. I was thinking that there's an entry fee for the race. Because we never made a new coin icon, I think. No, the Yoshi's don't drift. They will control just like the Yoshi's in the Yoshi Garden, or the other Yoshi ones I made. Medium to be knows to be harder, because it's going to get boring to have to do three similar races. Yes, for sure. Oh, I think we can remove this. Oh, I missed somewhere. Well, that puts us at 26. They're medicated? Oh, I see. Okay. Isn't there like a French saying? He spelled it like this. He is. That's funny. That's not funny, but it is funny to me. Yeah, definitely missed the queue. Yes, we're seeing a big arena with tons of people around. I don't know why the Yoshi's make it seem like a big spectacle. What about Excite Yoshi? Wait. I'm missing Excite Bike. I don't know why I typed Excite Yoshi. Looks like dog shit. But yeah, kind of like this is what I imagined it to be like. You know what, I actually hate this stage in Mario Kart. This is the most boring stage in the world. But something kind of like this, just a little more interesting, is what I had imagined. Yeah, but like the visual of like, there's guys on the stands and they're watching you go around. I think that works very well. We could make this a multi-lab race like this too. Like a free lab race. Yeah, what if we make this a free lab race and a time siege lab? It's a free lab race and we can use this place to find for each lab. I think that's fun. Study in college? Math. Maybe just the big baby part? Yeah, yeah, I guess that's kind of a good way to put it. Make it extra fast and it's already great? Yeah, the Yoshi would be pretty fast. That would make sense, Yuko, because I think pixel art is a really ugly art style. Do we streamerize the bumps and stops every race? That makes sense, but I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. Oh, there's also the Yoshi egg event here. Wait. Okay. I see. We can do this one right now. Let's go for the project. Finish the project. Yeah, let's get started on this then. The Yoshi laying an egg. Yeah, let's get started on this then. The Yoshi laying an egg. We're doing a Clash of Clans mission for real? Kind of. We're doing a Clash of Clans mission for real? Kind of. You don't think we should have the Yoshi laying an egg? Still, when it's done. Well, Town Attack, think about all the other projects that are like that, where it never gets done, and think about how little work they actually get done. When you look at mine and you see, like, twice a week I have a big update on the Case Clips channel and I do livestreams of me working on it. So we just wait a while before you come back? Well, it would be a few more starts later. But I agree, this is maybe not the best way of handling this. Maybe you should just get the egg instantly. At the start, like, fuck this part. Have you ever seen someone get a gift that wasn't the most appreciated by the person? I had a friend when I was younger. He was blind as a bat. I thought he'd become the daisy red rider, instead of never worrying about him shooting his eye out. I don't know what that is, but a blind person shooting a gun doesn't sound very good. Does the egg lie on the floor? Oh, yes. No, I'm too scared to break out of here because Bowser scares me. As long as he's here, I'm not moving. And then it's like a post-game egg? Yeah. I think making this a post-game event sets too many expectations. I hate this streamer. Thank you for the subscription, KakiDef. I agree, the egg right now is not the ideal. I think we can improve this somehow. I'm just trying to think how. Can we just post-game mini-level? Like a secret level that appears at 200 stars that's like the Champion's Road and it's super difficult. It was born literally a minute ago, dude. You know what, just for the joke. Yeah, just for the joke. Honestly, I'm kind of feeling it. Can you find the progress tracker? I think I put it in one of my videos. Shit, where did I put it? I should probably have a place to put it. So this is the mods.breaker. I'm going to go to my second channel right now and put it somewhere. One second. Progress tracker. There you go. It is now on the channel description. And there's a spider here going into my water. Spider flat. I don't want to do that biomech, I want to maximize the views. Okay. Too scared to hedge for bowser in the same round. It's not a dialogue if you come close. Can you beat bowser if you don't chase him if you come close? Okay. Zero star in the text box. What? Anymore? I was literally 1 minute ago, dude. Yeah, but I feel like this text box shuts down the discussion of was it worth it in a very funny and elegant way. Does it work as a game or software developer or is this self-taught? It is self-taught, but I also work as a software and game developer. But I got my job off of being already known from Mario 64 modding. Hello, X-Pal. Self-taught by writing libs assembly by hand for years, that is true. Where do we have Yoshi X? Course 1? No. Course 2 has some. No way, that's not this course 2, the other course 2. We have 3 course 2s. Win hex, bring him in, bring him out, yes. Mario 64 Madness doesn't really have much programming, but the edits I did there were done in hexadecimal. Ah, yes, I wrote my stuff in ChatGPT in 2012. I think this is a nice egg. And if it's bad, then Biobank can update it. We made a semantical sermal and it shows just how crooked the original one is. Okay, I see what you mean. But isn't this crooked on purpose? It has a certain charm to it. HackyDev is literally 13 years old, don't explain so much. Yeah, what now, HackyDev? I just loaned you. How does it feel? What's the second cycle for? Oh, for the primitive counter multiplication. HackyDev, I have won your love. 6-7! How's Banjo and ExMario64 coming along? Yeah, we're working on it very, very slowly. It's basically done, but we're still working on making all the NPCs. My tries? 134. Quit your job? What job? Wait, loading joke. You gotta quit your job at the Mudcake Factory? I tried. I tried. Maybe that's why they fixed it in Galaxy, because they wanted to rotate them around the pitch axis. Oh, roll axis. Yes, that's the plan, Mr. Insecto. Because I can't play Vanilla Mario 64 anymore. I don't... I wouldn't want to put out a game that I myself would refuse to play. These are bird eggs, not Yoshi eggs. How old are you? It's just 40. Do you have a Mario AI? I do have a Mario AI. Actually, my Mario AI is so fun to watch. Unfortunately, it still sometimes randomly crashes on Project 64, and I'm not sure why. So I can't spend a lot of time training it. But it is a fully functional AI that can play Mario 64 after a few hours of training. I've seen it run around, collect stars. One day I want to make a video on it, I guess. Okay, this is fucked up. See, I have this Mario AI that on an N64 trains itself to play Mario 64. And I want to show it to people. But I know how much people hate AI. So I feel like they would get really mad at me for that. How did you make it? It's literally just an evolutionary learning algorithm. And it's just raw powering through it, and it just happens to work well enough. It's got a neural network instead of AI. What if I named the video something like, I forced a nematode to play Mario 64. And then I explain that the brain I used is about as complex as that of a nematode worm. There is... I think 16 nets at a time. And the top 5 reproduce. And then it takes around a thousand generations. Before it's getting reasonable. It's not a very intelligent algorithm I've used, I think. Well, the issue with it is especially like perception. Because like, how do you do perception? Like, think about it. In Mario 64, how would you program perception of the world around you? I could have... I could have programmed perception of the world around me. But I could have programmed perception of the world around me. I could have programmed perception of the world around me. I could have just given it it's own position. And be like, it's going to just memorize the level geometry, right? But that is lame as hell. So I wanted it to work via perception. Defeated pixels? No, that's way too expensive. I made it do raycasts. So it's like... It's kind of like a fly, where it has like a hundred eyes. But they all only see one depth value. Can I describe pixels just with a rendering algorithm? I guess. Well, pixels don't really have a depth value, so no. I think that's why I wouldn't disagree with that. Well, pixels don't really have a depth value, so no. I think that's why I wouldn't disagree with that. Yeah, depth buffer, that's a more accurate way of putting it. Oh no, obviously I don't render the game. Oh no, obviously I don't render the game. Is this from the camera or from Mario? From Mario. Can you render out what the AI sees? I guess you could like... render the distance into like a grayscale pixel. At the end you have a rough idea. You don't see very well. I don't think a human could play with that input. 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 Thank you for the money. 6-7 Not for the message. 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 6-7 Is there a point-line shadow map with very low res? Is there a point-line shadow map with very low res? Yeah. Is there a point-line shadow map with very low res? Turn Mario 64 to play AI itself? No, it has to be like, I made Mario 64 play itself. Or, I think the funniest one is, I forced a worm to play Mario 64. Or, I forced a worm to play Mario 64. Could you still be Mario 64, you were a worm? I think you said just a dead one. Could you run the craziest AI grift? I could probably run the craziest AI grift. People have so much trust in me. I could be like, I make an AI and it will take over every job ever. And I would probably get at least 50,000 funding. And I would probably get at least 50,000 funding. Turn your petition and get a little money. True. It'd be like my version of a crypto scam. This would be like an exit scam. You know, if I'm like ever, if I'm ever exposed for doing something really bad, which I'm not doing anything really bad, but theoretically, if I was in the situation where that would happen, that's when I could do this. Rose exit, yeah! I wish there were cheetahs in this game. Everyone here agrees. There was? Tegers? I mean, obviously it's possible. I don't know. You're all in on Case Dollar? Yo! Oh my god, I have to run all these scams within like a week. Like Monday, we do AI funding. Tuesday, we do maybe Pirate Scheme. Thursday, we can do the Case Coin. That would be my most profitable week before I finally leave. And then I'm going to sell my YouTube channel. On the last day. Can you actually see the black platforms on black background? I have not tried, actually. And my summer card isn't here, it's upstairs, because I did test the analog 3D. Shit. We can maybe see it somewhat on Ares. Ares is pretty accurate. Let's check this one out. How much work would it be to make a Time Train mod where you race against stars against a Shadow Mario AI type thing? This is about real N64 resolution, right? Alright. I forgot I made you start here. Honestly, I think you can see well. This is such a common structure in this game, actually. Yeah, that's a good idea. Don't those platforms have glowing outlines around them to help you land? I think that's why I added those outlines in the first place, but I'm not sure. I don't know. Yeah, just not the tops. I'm probably getting rid of a bunch of end maps. Oh, okay. How do you make that background infinitely far away while also rendering it first? You remove the depth writing. So by just not making it write to the depth buffer, everything after just renders above it. And then you just move it with the camera. This is what the AI did not like. This effect is nice, but it basically makes it impossible to have fine detail. Hopefully I get some of the same shininess with Fresnel. I see you. Okay, there are some things that are not really end maps that are just the texture scrolling around to look like a reflection. And I'm somewhat happy with it, but not fully. Like the big building with the windows. I really like that part. That part's awesome. I hope we can keep it. The egg is in, and it's here. Now we just need to actually make it properly tall. We should probably just spawn the Yoshi. Now that I think about it, it should just be a baby Yoshi that spawns. No action, no flow. What? No. Can we fix this last impact? No. That was a long break. I think the time between last impact being finished and me starting the second is about the same time as me starting the second now. Okay. Hmm. We should now have the egg bouncing around and talking to you when you get close. But it's not spawning a baby Yoshi. Ow. The origin is also not good. We need to move it up. That noise it made was very good, though. Honestly, which is the third egg that took you most time? I'm not sure I understand. Are there other big eggs made between the two, like 64 and 3D Angels? Yeah, and Mario 64 eggs are green of time. Hello, Skyloft. You can keep that in? That's good. I mean, this is not in demand of you or anything. I just think it's a very neat effect. Okay, so I already gave myself the star. That's why I did that. Makes sense. I think it's 127. It feels like Last Impact was made by a different person to me. I need something else. Actually, I want something else other than that. This is what we do. We need to make an appearance in the game. He might be the second playable character. We already have a Luigi model in-game. No man, same river? I don't get it. What's the saying? I'm not familiar with this. If you didn't, a new episode of Nori was released today. You should watch it. I talking to you? You're 12, 6'7, 6'7, 6'7... 6'7! Am I speaking your language now? No man can ever step in the same river twice, because I'm the same river and it's not the same man. Oh, I see. I don't get it. I don't get it. This should work. I don't get it. Wake up Ethan! This Simba flips a meme. You need to get so close to it. I don't like that. I also don't like how it renders. You doubt I'll even remember you? You are a quote from the forums. Quote from Mario World Central? I don't think I remember you. They told me about the automatic moas and I was crazy to even think of that. Oh my god. Okay, fine. I want to show you something. I want to show you, automatic moas are awesome. So, what is the most unbiased, unopinionated review you can get? It's from a small child, right? Look how much she loves to enroll moa. She thinks it's like a dog or something. She had been hugging him for like 15 minutes. Today, she asked like 5 different times to go see the robotic lawnmower. She was like, I want to see Robby, Robby! And then she hugs him. I told you guys, robotic lawnmowers are awesome. Stop treating the lawnmower like a dog, it doesn't need a color or a name. My daughter is doing it, what do you want me to do? Hit her on the fingers and be like, that's not a dog. Bad baby. Is that what you want? Animals haven't developed wheels because they can't bend together to build roads. True. You'll see when she asks if it is a roleplay as a lawnmower. I hope that won't be an issue. I hope by then, humanity will have defeated the evils of AI psychosis. But honestly, no, it's not going to happen. So there is a Yoshi that hatches from here that we need to spawn. I think we want almost the same code for that. We have a life-sized Yoshi plush and she loves it. And gives it hugs and kisses too. Unless you think about it, how is a robotic lawnmower so different from a plush? The blades? That's true. When the lawnmower is running, she does run into the lawnmower and I'm a little bit worried about the blades. I'm a little bit worried about the blades. I'm a little bit worried about the blades. Let me think about this. Trigger is not blurring the alpha for run cutoff. That's a bit of a requirement though. Yeah, so you can have intensity alpha 4-bit or 16-bit. With 4-bit, you will get 16 steps, obviously. But you can have 4-bit, 8-bit or 16. So 4-bit is out of the question, because then you get 1 alpha and 3 intensity. The other gives you 4 each and 8 each. So yeah. You say talking to me. Okay. Okay. In the texture. I don't know what you mean by in the interpolated result. I think that's... Actually, I think that's... Fucking 12-bit or something. I'm actually not sure. No, papa. That's not gonna happen. No more demos. At best, you'll get another mini-hack or something like that. Okay. No, I should attach a little bit of a baby here. Uniform float. No, never float. Fixed point. Where's the baby? Where's the baby? Soaked car. You can soak my dick. No, not my baby. The Yoshi baby. Oh, wait. I see. Did you forget he has 12? Okay, we're doing the exit strategy. Who wants to invest in my AI startup? Who wants to buy my crypto? We're leaving. Good thing we brainstormed this beforehand. Can we get another out-of-the-console FPS counter video of your latest build? I don't have my summer card next to me right now, so unfortunately not. But maybe next stream. Yeah, I found that people generally prefer like 10 to 15 minutes over the 20-minute videos, so that's what I'm going to be aiming to do. No? Okay, sure. No. No, no, no, no, no. What method do you think would have been the best balance for easy future devs to modify and fully optimized? The one where it's just two textures baked onto one sheet. What do you think about unified memory architecture? I'm sure there's ups and downs. I don't really have a point of comparison. How fast is the FPS going up now? Well, the FPS now is around... Actually, I think it's 60 again. Well, with the profile adds, a little less, obviously. I think with the profile add, it's like 54. You shouldn't check your pants again. He's a magician. He's a peanut-stealing magician. He's Larry, the evil cat. He's the peanut snipper guy. That's the wrong text ID. Larry le malicien, that's what we call him here. Der puller-stealende Bandit Larry. He has the wrong text. It looks like he went for text zero, which is an issue. Your name is Suat. It's not Sukt. How do you spell it, Sukt? Oh, sorry, it's actually the one on triangles. I'm doing good today. That sounds very good. There's many animals that are born able to walk, right? It doesn't make any sense. On emulators, you're just going to get 60. And I can't test on N64 because my summer card is not here. They all struggle at first? Oh, I guess Yoshis are just that talented. Okay, it's clearly, though, using text zero. Or text three zero. No, wait. It's using text three one. Wait a second, what? How is this possible? Hello? Oh, it's the summer card. Great, we can put the summer card back into the N64. Oh, well, fucking obviously it wasn't working. I forgot to put in the new tree. The hedge! Are you expecting more? I was only born one minute ago, dude. I love it. I think I don't like the talk to Mario function used here. Are you watching the new movie? Which new movie are we talking about? Oh, it's just using it. for. That should be the correct one. Weird. Okay well, this is what I have to do for now I guess. All right, that's another two whole stars done in one stream. I want you to realize we just finished two stars in one stream. It seems so sweetie. I understand now why the blank emote was nothing on your end, you only see the first stream without any emotes, so for something that appears out of nothing, yeah. We still got to do sports while having a kid, I'm just very efficient. Oh, the Mario Galaxy movie. I think I'm going to be made to watch it regardless. So probably I'm gonna watch it. So for everyone who kept asking for an N64 test, here we are. So I want you to keep in mind when I go in here, this is with 800 frames of averaging. We spent a lot of time on the profiler itself, so there's a good chance that the frame right here is going to be lower than what we want it to be. But let's see. Waiting for it to average 800 frames. We're at 40, 45, 50, 55... Wait, what the fuck? 59, even though we are averaging 800 frames. So this would be basically consistent 60 if we weren't averaging 60 frames. 800 frames. So I think we can say that we have managed to hit 60 fps here. We can also take a look at the RDP profiler. So this profiler is the time it takes for the RDP to render a full frame. And this is more realistically what our frame rate is actually going to be if we divide a thousand by the number that we're going to get here. We have a thousand divided by thousand divided by one seven... one thousand divided by 17.3434110. That's 57.7. Okay, we should be having 57.7 fps here. I don't know why it's showing a higher number. So then the timing of the previous frame and the next one is there's some pipelining. It's averaging 800 frames that are reported as time it took for the RDP to finish. Is this the spot that lowers the fps on the level? No, it's just a very consistent test setup, which is why this was chosen. I guess that means our next step is to put on anti-aliasing and hit 60 fps with that. All right, let me go back here. Everything we tested so far was without anti-aliasing. With anti-aliasing we lose quite a few frames. Let's wait for the profiler to reconfigure itself. 52. Yeah, so this adds like 12% frame time roughly. The left thing is still jumpy. The left thing? Oh, you mean the bars? That's like showing how the last frame went. And it's true, Marty, that was what the engine used to be, but we've optimized it so much. Also, we've finished almost everything here except for the athlete Yoshi, the super happy tree seedling and the camming event and the trees. All things that we can't really do yet. That means next stream is going to be going underground, finishing this part, putting the entrance for the submarine. This honestly looks mostly done already. And then like put the roots of the super happy tree here. And then we can already move on to part seven. So that will be basically the halfway point. Actually, I think we're already way further than the halfway point, but officially by numbers it will be the halfway point. But yeah, until next stream, bye-bye!
