You you hello x-tenic hello nintendo for life hello akira hello kitsuna do you think of the name i made up um paper craft peaks or handmade heights were you the one that made those i like those i'm still thinking about the perfect name though i mean okay the names are good enough but i don't exclude the possibility that there's an even better one you know what i mean i would never just be like yep we found the perfect thing thank you for the sub i don't know why there was no alert for the sub but thank you very much for subscribing bizarre that my alerts are gone did i say you could go live next time ask nope i do what i want i don't even know what that means i'm taking away your nintendo no not my nintendo not first sad oh wait i know why i couldn't hear it that's why i was on the wrong speaker oh any ost wishes today hello waffle hello dylan don't eat me okay sure okay i will not eat you what are we doing today we're making the thwomp for this level i made some progress off stream but yeah unless Biobak comes on and tells me that he's done with the quest one rework then we do that at start paper gem ost okay i did these guys off stream they are pretty cool and i made this thing but this thing is nothing special even vanilla mario 64 and stuff like this so because one got so many reworks how about the neon level do you mean course nine to die in the next one every level will get a Biobak rework don't worry about it it's just that we care a lot about chris one because we want to make another course one demo that's why this one has been done again so um what if then then i would have added those that's what would happen if i did that so that's ugly  these are the same texture so it should be something like this but with a bigger white part i think so  and then we can move them like this the eyes so they're gonna bump up and down like this like real googly eyes you get the idea boom boom boom then he's gonna be like boom boom boom it's gonna look very cool boom boom boom      hmm maybe they should be even bigger like so i gotta make him look angry though does he look enough like he's made out of like construction paper or something i made him a little bit shiny but i don't know if that's enough oh you think you can get done today Biobak? that would be insane have you seen the googly eye idea i had? where we have eyes like this and i can move them around so it actually looks like he has googly eyes i'm not making the pupils angry i'm just adding something else to make him look angry incredible i don't like the material it's made out of looks like a normal thwomp yeah kinda just there's this shiny part on it but i'm not a fan of it i agree i think we should make them different somehow i was looking at origami thwomps here before but i'm not a fan of origami needs to be more plastic definitely eyebrows but we're thinking about the main body here need some origami in there but does he look like origami? i don't know man can you see me make him look like a paper box? really? how would you do that? i guess we need some bolts in here just full textures on him okay i think i get the idea let me think about how i want the folds to look here and attempt what you're saying for a bit so you probably have to fold in the middle here right? yeah i shouldn't get rid of the bevel here yeah actually fuck this let's remake this like this  okay it kind of works but not quite because i'm missing the depth i can add the depth though these two are going to be down and these two are going to be down as well wait at that point i'm picking everything the folds are too invisible to worry i'm still working on this i have an idea yep making tris darker was my exact idea as well that's too dark i don't like that the middle one is so dark what can this be? i don't know when you fold like this oh god so this would be under here once which means these two are above and this is under and then here these two would be under then here this would be under for sure and i would make this under as well and then here these two would be under and here these two would be under and then here these two would be under kind of looks folded now i'm using the latest model Biobak made because this is a folded cube yep cardboard clumps or rather folded clumps this is the inspiration basically i don't think i like the texture though now re-add some bevel oh god no i'm not doing that it looks better i think it's better too but i don't think it's good i should find something that looks more like paper honestly don't hate it yet we have so many paper flowers too you guys want to see what i did off stream? i will show you first of all very hype new feature you can both hit the z button for one frame after the other i'm also doing that isn't that cool but the thing i actually did is this guy here bring up the soul enemy and when he hits you it's actually a very strong enemy he can kill you pretty easily but he's a bit weak yes i will add sfx and gfx to the game do not worry i'm not just gonna make things give you no feedback that's crazy talk yuck this is what i was looking for this is paper why would i want that why would i want the UVs to rotate i'm confused do we want this to look like it's just painted i wish this left stripes is there a way to like paint strokes when you paint here can make one more clearer than this folder can i just google paint strokes how are we gonna be back on the paint strokes arc oh i found something decent thanks for watching i'll see you next time  What's TL? I mean I don't see a watermark here. Am I crazy for that? Does he look like a thwomp? Not yet. I think the face will have to do. Should have some visible glue around it. Huh. What is this quirky UV mapping? It's folded! At least that's the intention. I guess you can't really see it very well. I'm gonna get better, no worries. Alright. There should be a small cardboard rectangle that's colored in red, like it was colored with crayons. Yeah, I can kind of see that working, but why red? Too much contrast to see the fold effect, probably. I can try turning the contrast down a little bit, maybe that would help. I'm not gonna deal with that. And I'm gonna just use curves. Yeah this looks like shit. At least you can see the fold effect now. Angry we need angry eyebrows, but I don't think they should be red. I was thinking of just attaching a piece of cardboard that is angled, maybe. Gonna be cardboard or something else. I don't think I want to reuse the fuzzy material from the other guy, because it's like too much to my body. Oh, duct tape! I could make them out of duct tape. Conjecture is working so retro line very closely. Uh-oh. What if you made the eyebrows out of duct tape? I think I would like that a lot. Although that would mean we can't really go over the eye here with the decal. Nah, I'm making this out of cardboard. I think that's our best bet here. I'm curious what the sole retro line is, because I mean we are making retro level, right? It kind of sounds like a given that we might run into that issue. Smooth shading is involved. Okay. Oh, I see. So when you say so retro, it's like Mario in Unreal Engine. That's what so retro means. I hope not. He definitely looks very angry now. Now the mouth could also just be a piece of cardboard. It looks like he ate a lemon. Well, it kind of fits though, right? The way there is a shadow here as well. It looks a little too poopy. Minecraft is pretty accurate to what it looks like in the normal game though. They are googly eyes, they're going to bounce around. Cool bicam beard. This is what the thumb face looks like, by the way. He does just kind of look bad. No mouth. Now he needs a mouth. I'm disagreeing on no mouth. Looks like a stache, yeah. Maybe having it look like an open mouth is better. Maybe we can put some teeth in there somehow. It's not supposed to look like a stache now. He would need teeth to be like this. I don't think this is it. Honestly, I can kind of see this. Hello, Leo. The mouth more C-shaped. Make him like a little sadder looking. That doesn't really fit with the angry look the forms usually have. I'm not randomly giving a swamp a stache. I want this to look like a swamp. It's very important to me. I love the swamp. Seems it was made of foldable paper, yes. The mouth could be the corner of that bottom large triangle fold. I don't think so. Is mouth an indent into the paper? I know it looks like a mouth, but I'm not sure it's good. Move his face up a little bit. Yeah maybe a little bit. Yeah, that actually does a lot already. It's not centered. It absolutely is centered. It's literally mirrored in the middle. I wonder if it's maybe the color that looks wrong to me too. But I think we're good for now. So this swamp will have the ability to look around. If you look at this, I can make him look to the right or to the left. Which is very funny. And then I also have the ability to make the googly eyes just like fly around when he does his attack. Which is also very funny. I think maybe the mouth should be bigger, like... So that's the usual polygon limit for the MSD game. I don't really have a polygon limit, but 164 is pretty good. We have some enemies with like 300, we have others that are like 60. And just to make sure that the environment around it isn't like too expensive. Every Needlemire from Gumball? I am not familiar with Gumball. All right, and now that we're done, we delete everything and that's it. No more swamp. He's deleting all the detail again. Can you believe it? Did you ever rob those thimble guys you're working on? Yeah, the thimble guys are done. I can't run the corners without destroying the UVs basically. It's also kind of expensive to do. It does kind of look like Killer Bean. That's a good point. Should we make him look like or sound like stone when you walk on it? I don't think so. Leaves maybe too soft, sand no, snow? Maybe snow sounds close enough to what we want. There we go. We can make it rattling sound when he hits the floor like he's filled with something. Yeah, I kind of like that. Is it a bad thing Killer Bean is cool? No, I wasn't even thinking of Killer Bean when I made the stone. It just is what it is. It's just a coincidence. Platina. So then give him a love potion or what? The second cube is the collision. I'm not really a believer in lots. I think lots are very overrated. With the current setup. If Fast64 ever has branch C, then maybe lots will be worth it, but at the moment they're pretty bad. Jamsun can also be a smurf because he's paper and very lightweight. Yeah, but ehhh. Would be funny, but I know runesets. I tried to put the eyes closed again to make the mouth more open, sorry my bad English. You didn't make a mistake in that English sentence. And yes, I can do those things that could look a little bit better. Maybe I should just make these to the same piece of cardboard then. It's realistically how you would make this anyway, right? Yeah, I think this is better. I don't think I want to open the mouth anymore. Is there only the three new actors to make? Oh shit, that might actually be done by the end of the stream. That would be pretty hype. There is a problem in that I have to go to a thanksgiving dinner today. So I don't know when I'll have to head out unfortunately. So is there a next time I can definitely send you it? Yeah, that would be perfect, that would be very very nice. It's not being a paperclip, I don't think that would look good. I think you're routing errors. Rotating a cow on my mind, are you upset? He looks very cool in game actually. And I like this a lot. Koopy the paperclip. He will just backseat game you the entire time. Oh my god, that would have been perfect for the trawling competition. It's just Mario 64 but you get backseat games the entire time. You could even program like a backseat gamer AI into the game and that just like takes control away from you. So like, it would just control Mario for you and be like you're bad at this let me do it. And an unfolded slump somewhere in this stage, that would be very funny. There should probably be different types of slumps, I want some of them to jump back and forth as well. How many courses are left? Well we want to make 15, that's course 14 and quiz 15 is already halfway done. Do you guys remember what quiz 15 was? Halloween of Ardor. Can this run on Nintendo 64? Of course. That's the whole point of this. Oh, well I would love to show you what quiz 15 is but looks like I imported the garbage level here instead. Cool. We need 0x20 frames of this so 36 I think, 37? Yes I did multiplication and hexadecimal. Is this mod a sandbox one or linear 3d lens styled? It's sandboxy. To pet 16 on an N64 cart. Who is fat 16? Why do you want to jail him in an N64 cart? Basically the way most levels work is that it's like open like a Mario 64 world. It's a lot bigger and then instead of finding stars you find entrances to either like linear challenges or like puzzles or stuff like that. So there's a lot more meat to the stars. It runs at the same resolution as vanilla Mario 64. Is there a file system? I mean obviously you can put a file system on an N64. Why wouldn't you be able to? I don't understand the question. Classic case nice true. Do you know who Rafa4k is? Nope. To the outside our our it's a funny one. Yeah, I only know pants because he's a chat or day. I think it's a he. Intents got me fucked up dude. I'm scared to refer to people. I'm scared to refer to people. I'm scared to refer to people. I'm scared to refer to people. wasn't it? Or at least it was submitted. Yo, bro, chill, chill, bro, bro, bro, how far do you want to go? F3 2020 and it's not released yet. As against the rules. Now I see what I forgot. This was necessary after all. Stupid emulator doesn't reset memory when you reset the game. I wanted the womp sound. There we go. This is the one I want. Let the camera shake. There we go. And the particles. And now we should have a decent one. Rain stick enemy. Oh, that was fast. Why am I calling for? That's for doing the SMS thing. They're basically the same program. I just made so many people upset. There's some sort of bug in my engine that makes those enemies not squish Mario right now. Oh, you can't debug at all with VS code. I did not know that. You guys know that thing in the visual pseudo where if you compile fails and asks if you want to run the last successful build. Has anyone ever pressed yes on that? You can't debug with VS code. So what's the difference then? I don't know. I don't know. Oh, I see. So VS code is just the lightweight version of VS. That's all I'm going to memorize this now. Oh, wait. I kind of changed my mind mid polling here. No wonder it didn't work. I also don't like the missed particle circle fast small here. Because I think our guy is bigger. We should increase the forward roll base and the range and then increase the drag strength a lot. That way, they will appear further out right away. Small, big, true. Glad you enjoy my viral names. Why is he turning around, bro? You're not supposed to be turning around. You're supposed to be turning around. You're supposed to be turning around. Did I set his B perm second back to anything? I don't think I did. No, it is not set. Oh, wait. There we go. It's part of the SEC. That's a good question. We had a plot at some point, but then I realized the plot sucks, so I want to change it. First, the plot was Bowser goes to Yoshi's Island and captures all the Yoshis and makes them work for him. But a whole slavery plot is maybe a bit too much for a Mario game. We definitely still have to do something like that, something Bowser threatens the Yoshis. But I don't know if we want to go into a full on slavery plot. Why does Bowser do that? Well, he makes them work in his factory. It's over. Well, I'm woke now. Glad you like it. Epic Legends. I don't know if I will make a sequel, but maybe. Playlist is this paper gem OST. Princess Yoshi, if she was created another day for Mario. No, I want the Yoshis for sure. So the forms will work now. I'm very confident in that. Daisy's Fury with Luigi. There was an idea someone suggested to me. It would be like a game about all the Mario Party 2 boards with like different landscapes and costumes and stuff. And then each individual level would play like the world on Peach's Fury did. So that would be like a 150 star egg I could produce in two months. Because if you didn't know, Peach's Fury was made entirely in a single week. And I think that would be insanely fun and people would love to shit out of them. Oh, yeah, right. Mr. Come and make Mario Party 64. But the thing is, he messed it up. The one good game in that you couldn't actually play. I would like to not mess it up. The same game didn't work. But no, I'm serious. This is what someone on Twitter like he brought me. He wanted this. He wanted to pay me for it. I don't know if he actually will pay me for it. But if he does. I will do it. And then we would have a fun game like that. I have not thought about remaking Lost Impact. That is a stupid thought. Didn't look like it has a shadow. Wait, does it not? I never actually looked. Oh wait, I know why. Is it drop the floor that I have to call? You're right, he doesn't have a shadow. Oh wait, I made the shadow literally zero transparency. Hello Chris Doyle. I am having a gay old time. Okay, that's a little too small. Oh, I like that, that's the perfect shadow. Yes, I will edit this instead of homeschooling That's the next step. Yes, I cheated. What are you going to do? Call the cops? Tell me about them. Okay, I don't want this to go to zero here. I have noticed. Hello, Benzie. Oops. There we go. Oh, he is calling. I don't want that. There we go. Sedimentary lock, right? I mean, unless you're good at platforming, yes. If you're good at platforming, I'm sure you can find a way around it. Basically, nothing in this game is mandatory if you're good at the game. And that's the beauty. Check discord. Course one update.zip. All right, I'm going to program the googly eyes first and then we do this. Does that sound good? There's time to look at it all. I don't know. I have not been told when I have to leave yet. There is a chance. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  All right. Time for my weekly course one rework. First of all, I'm going to rename this into course one newest and not course two newest. I know. Disappointing. We spent the most of your development time on course one. The most. How do you define what the most is here? Because it's not more than 50%. I can tell you that much. It's also not more than 10%. The development time spent on course one is probably like 7%. Okay. Be there for five. Okay. Okay. There you go. That's that's when I have to leave or have to be gone by like at five. And I need to show before. And then it's like a 30 minute drive. So I should be heading out around 415. So we got an hour. All right. So we had render issues with the sky. How is this making render issues? Shit. Okay. You see this message here. Something wrong there for sure. Okay. Oh, you used 4.1. Ah, okay. You use shade and color combined, but not here. Okay. See, did you change the lighting on these? Nope. So I will do that. Now the shadows to face away from the sun. Okay. Make sense. Right. Okay. We got that. Nice. Okay. I need to make notes of which changes here. I need to make. So in case. Also. Okay.  Main area. Shouldn't be too much. 2.79 is go to those. I understand why. There was also some sort of issue with these here. These are definitely not cut out. Oh, oops. Okay.  Geo, we don't need Z-Buffer.  Random blender using Z-Buffer must enable. Interesting. IMRD. Doesn't matter. We can just pass along. This should do it. Is this the entire bottom row? Mostly. Is this everything? That is everything. All right. My first order of business will be importing this with the fixes. So we can have a proper look in game at what this would look like. Oh, the lag. So not everything needs to use a Z-Buffer. If you draw something first and behind everything else, you don't need a Z-Buffer. Or if you want to draw something unconditionally, you don't need a Z-Buffer. You only need a Z-Buffer if you want to prevent drawing something over something else. Makes sense. But the idea to make unique ambient level design?  In order to 4x1, I have no idea what I'm on. I only have an update blender if the first 64 devs tell me I need to. All right. This is pretty much 50 FPS. Moment of truth. The trees look a little bit weird. The clouds aren't fully transparent. And there's clearly render order issues here. Right, I should have put those on layer 0. Oops. All fixable, don't worry about it. This is definitely a layer 0 one, though. What's going on here? Oh, this also needs to be layer 0. Same with this. And then we need to set the render mode. And then this needs to be combined 1-A. Input, input, input. Combined 1-A. Nope, nope. Same here. Don't want these, these. I don't know if frost blending needs to be on. Probably better to turn it on. I don't actually know what it does. Again, the watch conditions would just not blend. Oh wait, we can't do this. We actually have to use frame buffer color here. Okay. This will need the draw order perfect. Can you just make the background use vertex colors? It does. Hello, Tanya. Please release before Christmas. Please, case. Please. Please shut the fuck up. Leave me be. Sorry. I am not friends with the bottle guy. Oh, that makes the blender render good. Interesting. So there was some issue with this and I don't know why. What happened with these? They rendered really weird. Really, really blue for some reason. It might just be that the draw order was inverted. All right. As discussed, the sky should render behind everything else. And the clouds, the sun should look infinitely far away. Okay. I will make this a note. The sun texture definitely looks very cool. I should also make a note. Reposition the lens there. Some more room around the tree house in the middle part of the slope to star one. Okay, I remember that. That's the collision map. Do not worry about it. I don't hate the politics here. I just don't really know him. All right. And we have this area. Yes. Okay. Area two. Oh, this one had a glow up. That is nice. Slight adjustment to lighting. Oh, my God. It's now filled with carrots to the brim. Mushroom is now glowy. Makes sense. We move past the vegetables. Whole bottom of caves now full of carrots. Yeah, looks better. Makes more sense. The same wooden plank bedrooms are now part of the walls. Yeah, makes more sense as well. And it looks better. Graffiti move to other areas. Main area behind the carrot plus behind the tower and forest on one of the castle towers. Okay. I like that. I'm fine with that. Are these still on the floor? There's a Goomba. No longer existing in the area here. And this guy is under the floor. This is all fine. That's the middle area. Hmm. Oh, this one's a bit weird, maybe. Cause they don't really want this to be another non-existent surface. But that might be fine. Should be fine. Oh, you disabled shading in the buffer? And you set this to point? And you were looking at the pipeline span buffer coherency? You changed the pipeline span buffer coherency? Tech just buried its respective correction on? What was Bone doing here? What the hell? Oh, that is weird. He changed the pipeline span buffer coherency. Which, by the way, it is set to n-prim in my game and not 1-primitive. But that's still a setting that I don't think he knows what it does. I don't think you should be touching that. This is also set to point. And n-primitive. What is going on? No perspective correction? This is so weird. Are we doing sneaky framebuffer instructions? That's actually an RDP render thing.      Basically, if you set it to 1-prim, it has to wait until the triangle finishes rendering before it starts the next. If I remember correctly. Point looks pretty sharp. Yeah, it looks like 64DS. Let me take a look at this area in-game, just to make sure. I know, I just wanted to explain it. Just to make sure everyone understands. New level? Nope, just course 1 again. I got another mushroom too. I'm sure if there's other random bugs, we will see them. I don't know.    Yeah, I would say there's a few issues here maybe. In front of the mushroom. I don't even know how he did this. This is the most fucked material ever, it doesn't even come back. This doesn't use shading? How did all of this happen? Oh it doesn't use Z-Buffer. Or smooth shading? How did any of this happen? I have no idea Biobak. That is so bizarre. Did you? No never mind. Even if you had made this out of some sort of background thing it wouldn't make any sense. Maybe you need to flip the surface? No there was no Z-Buffer on the surface. There were 15 different properties that were all set wrong. That's what the issue is, not any Z-Buffer. I wasn't debugging anything, I knew what the issue is. I just have to undo the issue. Even now there's still issues bleeding from other things in here that are wrong. Like there's clearly something wrong on here. Everything else on this looks correct. And something's wrong up here with the carrot. No shading, no Z-Buffer again. Int and primitive. And all these weird properties here. Oh this might turn into more work than I thought it would be. H-P-T-M-X-F-R-6-F-O-M-A-T-R-U-M. I know what it looks like. Why did you? What did I post? Any other textures or polygons? I just said all of them to use texture filtering. Nope. I love Dekker. They do me what I'm doing. All right, looks good now. The contents of the mushroom. Who cares? Do not worry my friend. He has skills, he can breathe. Something about the backgrounds is still very wrong. Is this missing something? Something, isn't it? But something is cullback. Okay, what's going wrong here? Texture zero alpha is the shroom. Primitive should be fine. We use shading, also good. How did he do this? What? Wait, you use combined color in cycle one? Of course that's not gonna work. So Alpha did that set to disable again here for some reason. Something looks so weird, you gotta release that man. Not sure what you're talking about, I wasn't paying attention. Do you mean the one that you bounce off of? The one that goes boing? Do you think maybe these bugs were introduced somehow along the material upgrade chain? I don't know if force blending would do what I need. Let's take a look at this again. Nope, nope, couldn't have been me, it was someone else. But these are originally v2 materials, right? And now we're in like what, v8? All right, that part works. Just something about the top is wrong. We'll just not do anything besides copying over new nodes. Oh, smooth shading was disabled, that would do it. I might have disabled smooth shading here because it was all using the same color. If you're using the same vertex color and everything, you don't need smooth shading. Hey, it's looking decent, we got it working. Well, there's some random order problems here, but they are fixable. No random order problems with the mushrooms or the clouds, which is surprising. I also really need to move the sun flare up. There's something about this that looks really wrong. I'm not the only one that sees it, right? Yeah, it doesn't look like this in game or in blender. Oh, it's a two cycle material. Okay, you couldn't have known this, but whenever you use more than one texture in the material, you are 100% forced to use two cycle and there's nothing you can do about it. Okay, let's see if I can get it to work here. Because I kept getting blind, fair. You know what, there's this thing going on where if you've entered a new graphics effect, you're very prone to overdo it and I probably overdid it the first time I used it. No, I think we should keep everything clipping. I think it's better if you can't see what the actual level geometry is like. Makes it a bit of a puzzle game. I think you should completely guess like what's going on. Press numpad zero and look at that. Okay, let's... There we go. Oh, that's very nice. Castle has more depth and looks less two-dimensional. I agree. This is the boss fight area. Castle is now red because it looks better with the green. True. New railings on the side. Oh, that looks sweet. Increase door size so the king can fit in without clipping. Fair enough. Added a lot of roofs. Oh, yeah, there's plenty of roofs here. Good, good. Changed middle roof shape a little for better flow. Okay. Narrowed down the boulder arm to make the uvs better. Couldn't recreate the goomba banners on red, so he is gone from them. Oh, that's sad. The goomba banners did add a lot to this, but it's fine. It's true, I'm the boss. Missing a door. He broke it, I'm sure. Improved lighting effects. You are absolutely right about that. Oh, the new tree texture is cool. New railays scrolling both directions and opposite directions. Okay. Did you keep my blender trick here? I don't think you did. Oh, but okay, I see what you did.  New trees with cooler leaves and probably fewer polygons. Zeina says the farm will offer her to make a red banner. I can let her know. I don't know if Zeina made the original banner. I think I made that. Remember trees in the back because of the new towers? Actually, maybe I don't. Maybe I just googled this. There is invisible walls across the fence. Added a third row of tree wall for more depth. Triple overdraw. Okay, triple overdraw is fine, but like you don't see these, right? Or do you see them? That's a bit of a problem. It's not letting me edit this. Oh, there we go. So, what the hell? I'm thinking doing this is gonna cut the cost a lot and not look different at all. So, that's what I'm hoping for. Are those just black? Are they necessary? Yes. They're not just black or actually they're very close to black, but not quite. I can't make a game like that because then no one can play it. You can get rid of a layout, but we don't need to. This game runs very well. And an exit for the area looks nice, even if you can't use it. Oh, I see. Yeah, it's kind of like an easter egg because most players probably wouldn't even see that. I don't know if you can see it, but it's kind of like an easter egg because most players probably wouldn't even see that. I'm not sure how to delimit the area, but cracks in the floor do not look good with that new design. Pillars on the stone fences are in spots where the cracks were, so maybe something to connect them. Maybe the blue light force barrier thing every game does. Oh, that's... I don't like the blue light force barrier. But we can do something. We can think of something. Even with all things I added, for some unknown fucking reason, it is 10 fewer polygons than the original. Okay, that is bizarre. Are you sure about that? Feeling is weird how the king follows you around. He looks like he's on a treadmill. Yeah. Quick and easy way to make it 100% meta would be to have the boulders follow you instead. You know what? Fair enough. I will make a little note. But then you always have to put the king in the middle, right? That makes the boss fight not work anymore. I don't think I can do that because then the boss fight is just send in the middle. Okay. The king goes anywhere and the boulder follows you. Oh, okay. Yeah, I like that. Boss fight change. The king moves somewhere. The boulders follow you instead. Yep, that works. Hmm. With this, you'd be able to give them prop animations and rotations for moving from one point to another.  The boulder stops checking position once it drops from your castle, so it's not unavoidable. Yeah, of course. Slide area. Well, we should. Just to be safe, take a quick look at this.  Yeah, I figured something like this was gonna happen. But this looks better than I thought it would. As in less buggy than I thought it would be. We definitely need to update the lighting here. The world light. This looks really poopy right now. The level is so dark and Mario is so bright for some reason. Something about this is very wrong. Am I the only one thinking that? Yeah. That was much brighter in-game than it looks here. Very weird. Did you already set the scroll? You did not. You said you wanted to scroll these in different directions. So I'm a good doing. Looks good. Slide area. Oh, that's the retro area. Slide area. The vine now wraps around the slide and holds the birdhouse. Oh, that is so cool. Yeah, oh my god. That looks sweet. I'm sure the thorns can only be removed if they don't fit. Thorns might be a bit much for... Nah, I think thorns are fine. They look very cool. Birdhouses now look like actual birdhouses. Fair enough. End of the slide now aligned with the walrus who was pissing me off when modeling. Oh, there's a bird nest here. End of the slide. It's now filled and doesn't drop you under the birdhouse if you don't jump. Fair enough. What's this here? Ah, that's the Yoshi coin. Any coolness for the star? Move the Yoshi coin behind the final birdhouse. Edges of the wooden slide now all have a mostly seamless backwards transition. Did they not have that before? Oh my god, no. This material is fucked again. What happened? Oh, something really weird must have happened on the edges when the slide is cut. Oh, that's nice. Um, I gotta check something with the mushrooms as well. Oh, but they have smooth shading. Something about this one was wrong again. It definitely went callback. Fixed wonky flower face. I don't really see what's different, but I still like it, so that's good. Smoother color transitions on the slides. Alright, we just puked the whole rainbow over it. Hello Vito. Who's texting me? Oh the text itself. I see, I see. That would make sense. My textures typically do not look good. What the tarnation? Well, I'm guessing that means Biobak just missed us and doesn't want us here. That looks so cool. Meow meow meow meow. Meow meow meow meow. You think we should make the slides match the collision too? Anyone got any insights into this? Maybe any professional game designers in chat that can tell me whether the slides should match the visuals? How many tries does that sunflower have? Like just ahead of the sunflower? 64. References should not match, there should be no collision at all. Fair, I like it. Games, these things have gotten too easy. We need a bit of difficulty. Okay, Biobak, the smooth shading. Explain yourself. Minor visual changes, changed up sky walls. Big update to Zera incoming, I just have to figure out something. Wait, what? Do I have an old version of this file? You're reading the wrong changelog. Nope, it says that it's from today. Don't tell me I was working on the old file the whole time. That's definitely new. Oh. Look, Discord. Changed up sky walls, removed fences and added bushes. Fences are never in levels with trees and bridges. Okay. And it's not anything with the castle and bridge. Okay, so this is where you start here. I guess it's the retro pipe. All right. Removed the cloud platforms, which are not in the game. Not like this, at least. Fair enough. Added moving platforms to reach the end section. Okay, we can do that. First one was front to back, second one was left to right, last one was up and down. Okay. Ending section with the classic pole and castle. Ooh, this is cool. No effect other than this animation, unless you can figure out something. Maybe the classic jingle if you reach the top. At least the area behind the castle. Oh. That is kind of cool. I should add a blue coin switch here instead of this. How do you get here? Just jump down there? Jump down, okay. And then once you go into the pipe, you come out. The front of the castle here, maybe. I think that works. Okay. Only the castles, flagpoles, and pipes should be smooth shaded. So what is this? Oh, this is supposed to use lighting. I think it will be smooth shaded in game. Yeah, flat shaded. What? Oh, God. Oh, Lord. Okay. Okay, so you want camera lighting? Is that what you mean? I was completely expecting the thing to move. I can add camera lighting. But no global lighting at all? Okay. Let me try that. I'm just going to add an edge split modifier here for now. My guess is he wanted edge split on anything larger than 46 degrees. 70? 45 and 70 have the same result, right? Thinking about it logically, there's only 45 and 90 degree angles. So anything above 45 and below 90 works. Okay. We need to set all the lightings here. Course 1 doesn't have any lighting at all. Wow. C1 underground. This can keep having that. Course 4 is C1 retro. Area 4. Area 5 is the boss castle. Okay. Okay. So you said no directional lights? Got it. So for the boss, we likely want the light all from above. Actually, we do want a slight angle, right? Yeah, this is actually perfect. Because the light that breaks in here is a slight angle. And then Course 1 underground. Course 1 underground we want to be just kind of dark. With an extra light added here. Thinking about it, it's like... I guess we do want light from here. But other than that, it should be mostly dark. So that would be mostly from the X direction. Maybe 35 from the Y direction. A little bit from here. Set it all to 2F. And then this one to 2F. And then we're going to add... Behave light here. That's it, right? Since you wanted a glowing mushroom, that's exactly what you're going to get. Wait, what? This is the boss fight lights. Not the normal lights. The RGB should probably be nearly white. Maybe slightly yellow. Let's try it. Camera lights only in the retro section? I've set it to be almost only camera lights. If it's camera lights only, then some stuff is going to be completely pitch black. And we don't want that. Let's check the lighting setups real quick. So we've got mostly dark light here, and then... There should have been an actual light here. Why is there not? Did I do a mistake? That could be just because of X2. There's some issue with X2 lighting. So that's what I will blame for now. Ooh. I don't know what that is. That still looks pretty atrocious. Did I even export the level? Feels like I didn't. Anyways, because one gone through. I mean, there's always small reworks, right? Of course, you always can upgrade it. But I think this is the second big Biobak rework. What the hell? Phew. Some bizarre stuff going on here. Okay. That's better like that. Ooh, never use the SM64 presets. They're all atrocious. And this would also be an issue. Why says it to Psychomaterial? That's very surpri- Oh, because of that. Makes sense. Okay. Okay. We're almost there. Just gonna get rid of the God Alpha Mario 64 presets. These are cutouts. Interesting. Then we'll perform slightly worse than the non-colored version. But it's not significant enough that I care. Right now. Okay. Burn the piece in a flat. It is what it is. Okay. That's what you want, Biobak? This looks kinda sick. You're wondering why the bushes are floating? That's a Glideon bug. Fixed lighting looks off from many angles. This is the camera lighting. This is only camera lighting. Angle Glideon is somewhat accurate, but it does point for the textures wrong. Okay, this is what we want. Nice, nice. Looks weird without Hoppistark. What? Yeah, I think this is good. I'm just gonna clamp this texture. To avoid that.  To avoid the unnecessary issues in Glideon. This is just collision. Wait, where's the area root? Oh, the area is not centered. The actors is where it's at, though. Massive improvements. Big optimization. Alright. I am looking forward to that. The problem is, I do have to head out for Thanksgiving dinner. So I can't look at them right now. We will look at them next time I stream. I won't look at them in secret. So it will all be a surprise to everyone, including me. Everyone except Bio-Beck. We got done with the important parts. Which is the levels. Yeah. Offstream, I guess I'll finish some stuff with the Thwomps and stuff. And the next time we stream, we will work on the Chris 1 rework. I think that sounds good. Alright. Bye-bye.
