Hello, can y'all see us? Is everything working as intended? You are on the screen. Hello, external might. Hello, external might. Hello, Dario. Hello, gamer. Sup, gamer. It's so disgustingly warm in here right now, holy fuck. Should I open the window? Yeah. I'm hoping no birds come in. Oh yeah, it's Canada Day. First time catching a streamer better not be the last time. So you guys might be asking, Kees, what have you done this week? I have prepared a lot of stuff that we need to do in order to get multiplayer in. Oh, wrong audio output. Some code. Found some minor performance improvements. Made the game more stable. Added some new functionalities. Overall, very happy with what I did. Oh, and I lost all my stars, whoops. Start from the beginning again? No. The start screen that we haven't seen for like almost a week. Oh yeah, I also broke into actions, whoops. So, I haven't really done any changes to this level, but this is what I've been testing. I think we're gonna bring back monthly course testing, where a player will just get to test one course at a time. Just to make sure the gameplay is good. Yeah, but we should be working on this level today here. Where we actually implement the textures for the cement pit. Is webcam supposed to look like a painting? Nope, it's not. But that is a funny idea. Undefined reference to wet dry world. DL footprints i4. Cool, cool, cool. Why is this called hair? Wait, why is this texture called hair? I absolutely did not make this texture called hair. What? Huh? How did that happen? All right, programming, yep. No, okay. Something really weird happened. The texture here turned into what it was not supposed to be. What the fuck? Wrong? Oh shit. Did you finish the zoo rework? It's a zoo stream today, baby. Let's go. I'm up for that. Yep. Let's go. You didn't know that? You thought Decom was free? Nope. Children are paying a bloody price for our entertainment here. So yeah, this is what we did last time. We were also going to do something for ground pounding and for sliding. But if we do the zoo today, then I guess that is what we do. What OST do we pick for today? Any OST wishes? Can we do an entire playlist of cat noises as an OST? If you have one. I will find one. Chainstuck is massive. Okay. Let's go. Where's the model? I guess until I have the model, I will just keep working on this. You sent me a butt print, right, Zeyna? Did I not send you the butt print already? I'm asking if you did. You didn't, but it's not mirrored. It should be mirrored. Oh, I have to mirror it from the top. I forgot. But here. Here's a cat. Just one cat? We're not listening to the same song for an hour. All right, let's listen to Mario Party for OST. Actually, I'm not even sure if it should be like S-shaped. Like this. Because what if Mario rotates, you know? I think it should just be a single dot. Yeah, that's fine. Did you copy my full radius scaling code for the transitions? I think so. Oh, yeah, I didn't mention that, but we have smoother transitions now. Look at that. And I guess you can see it better in course 1. You see how the transition pops in from the side all the way instead of instantly being there? All right, I'm making a butt print. You're remaking it? I'm making one because we need one. I think I set 12 by 12. Something like that. Yours was 100 by 80? I only had that so I could scale it down properly. Someone played my ROM mech on YouTube and rated one of the levels a 1 out of 10. Get fucked. What's the texture size for the butt print again? I think 12 by 12 is good. Okay. Oh. It needs to be a transparent dot like this. I'm really proud of the work I did on some of them. All right. Let's check out what Vioback got us. He's been working on this for a while. This might be a big change to what we used to have. I mean, if your level is shit and people tell you it's shit, you should still be happy that at least someone's telling you it's shit. That's better than people just being nice for no reason. If they can point out why it's shit, that's the most useful thing that you can get. Just be happy that someone is willing to do that. I really gotta make disk space. I'm down to 7 gigabytes. Change lock zoo. Let's see this. You don't live streams on your discord. Oh, good call. Does anyone have a link to the stream? Okay, wait, I'll find my own live stream. Oh, okay. Okay, this is very grainy. Not really what I expected. It looks really nice, though. Looks very nice. I'm not convinced on these bricks here. To be honest. I think they work really well here. And this UV mapping is not acceptable. I'm sorry, Biobak, but I have to fix this. I cannot stand for this. Before I look at anything else, I will fix the UV mapping. Oh, shit. You have the weird snapping thing on again. Uh... How do I actually snap this shit? Goddamn. Snap with closest. There we go. Hey. Okay, sorry, Biobak. God, it's still bad. Why is it still bad? Why is it not doing anything? Is this inverted? What is going on? Oh, wait. Okay. Okay. That was the first thing I had to do. I couldn't live with how that looked. Missing stuff by doing that case? What am I missing with? It's fine that there's a scene here. This one's not visible anyway. I know the other wall is taller. Oh, oh, this. Shit. Oh, that's tough. Okay, but what if I at least make the color the same? Okay. What if I make this wall as tall as the other one here? Like, what if I make this go up instead? Or down? This one here? That improve it? Huh. I mean, it looks a little weird, but not as weird. I think that's an improvement. Why is it snapping? What is it even snapping to? Okay.  Main error. Reduce texture loads by reusing materials. Okay. Oh, boy, that's the collision map. Okay. Hmm. So the wall no longer uses my material here that had two textures wrapping into each other. It now has... No, it still has two textures. Okay, but they're different ones. Let me see those textures here. We got this texture here and the cobblestone texture from Minecraft. I can now only see the cobblestone texture. Is that on purpose, Biobak? Or... Oh, no. There's a lot of UV mapping here. Oh, texture mapping. I guess I'm just not seeing it. Oh. You see, it's messed up. Wow. Okay, I wonder if this works in-game, but not here. You know what? We're going to do something weird today. We're going to first export this. Oh, no. How do I actually... I forgot how you can actually see everything here. Oh, the filter. And I need the hierarchies.  I feel like this is going to mess up the water and stuff, but let's see. Just sent you a new butt print. All right, let's see that. And it's all symmetrical this time. Oh, yeah, that looks good. I like that. It's too bad we can't have his butt cheeks in there. Texture include. Texture include. Why would a texture include be required? Is there a clown? Hello. Water ripple. Water ripple layer six is missing. Okay. Water ripple is this one here. No. What is water ripple? Oh, I know what water ripple is. It's the reflections on the ground here. Did you remove the ground reflections or they're still here? It won't let me select this. Water ripple dot zero zero one. Okay.  That hopefully works. Alright. It compiled, now we can look at the level. I am from the entire northwest. Looks at gray circle, hell yeah, that looks good, I like that. Only so much you can do within the constraints. Oh, it looks fine in game. You see that, Biomech? Do you prefer this? It's just a fast 64 render bug. The level looks so much more alive now. Yeah? I like it, I like it a lot. It does look pretty cool. The gate texture looks really cool.     Where we're chomping is is really nice. Yeah, he's still in his little teddy bear you better See you oh He now also has this to jump through And he has a full bowl of food Wait, hold on you change the teddy bear all together. Yeah, it's a different teddy bear, but it looks a lot better. Yeah Way better than my old teddy bear Bushes are awesome. The bushes are pretty good All right, update a slightly darker shading to look like barrio stadium, oh That's the idea Updated benches. Let's see the benches. I Will have to remake the entire collision map. Oh This is good But this is probably a lot higher poli I sit on my money in a stupid hand in a sloppy taco Update and pot plants even fewer vertices now Okay, yeah, he's kind of look better arguably Look at the aquarium name Wait, there's an eel on top. Yeah, the eel is really good Aquarium Wait His eyes are just Okay, the eyes are rendering a bit wrong easy fix His eyes just look kind of on hinge But I love it it works really well for a zoo I See, okay. He's on the cutoff layer. That's weird And I won't let me select what is going on My right click is broken. No, it works outside of blender Oh What It works again Actually, I should put these on layer 6 and just have them be decals I Need new goobie-goobies, there's gonna be tons of goobie-goobies Leave us on my right like I knew it fuck Lila updated zip lines to look more coherent in the level Okay Like a zip line now Yeah, the one thing I'm not sold on is the wood texture here. This would this a bit like too grainy You know what? I mean? I Think I don't like the wood texture like how it like rotates along Along, you know what? I mean? Yeah Doesn't look great That's my only complaint on that are you like that's that on the structure of my back The lighting for the aquarium no, it looks pretty good to me At first I want to finish on the main stage here The benches to get leggies up to the car room entrance and name the joke translates into pretty much every European language. So we're good Thinking the walls around Goomba Dory and penguin area. So they look more like waltz Yeah, I can't swap the texture on no problem All right. Oh I look when I like what you did here. That is so much better. I Like drop flowers this way. Oh That's way better. I didn't think of that at all Oh, this Goomba's animation is a bit bugged out And the penguin area, okay, it's pretty good to me Oh For Mario because he's all you mean Mario should be. Ah, yes Yes, Laurie should be updated by the current light. That is true a light object. I was pretty good I Replace square floor with area with pentagons square floor area. Oh This year, that's a hexagon that can't be it. What is the square floor? Yeah No, this is a scratching pool Wait, the fucking guy just one shot me. Yeah, I Must have done something wrong Wait, I know the bug Hmm It's supposed to do free damage Okay, we'll figure this out another time oh Okay edit funny signs funny signs So the new stomping sign was already there What other funny signs did he add? Yeah, don't worry about the polygons I made this level back when I thought polygon count method more Please don't tip the employees Right here, please don't There's an actual burger stand now Nice that's really funny Around the monkey, please feed the Well, it is Mario's zoo he would just cheap out and ask you to feed the animals Please feed the animals. Usually they ask you not to do that. That's that's the joke Oh, he has a pillow too, that's nice updated Mario building massive W. Oh My god, that is so cool, too That is not intended that is my mistake that is not on Biobak Pretty sure it's like the beeper. I'm free on the subject here. That's too big Yeah And this pops too small This might just be because of the new condition map and everything Tree area Center changed wooden fence around tree for a chain link fence, you know, Mario would keep them locked up Tree area. Oh This fence here, yeah, okay. Yeah, that's good Changed water texture and color to reflect the fact that monkeys piss in there. Just kidding. It's for color consistency. Oh Here Yeah, can it make sense although it's hard to even see this as water right now, isn't it It's kind of difficult to see that I think this should be a bit more blue no Yeah So, let me just make my own notes Mm-hmm wouldn't wouldn't fall for a zip line texture change Like me what I'm doing. This is slightly bluer Replace flower patch when dry grass patch more in theme also flower punches look just bad Yeah, yeah, I like this Move plants around that is fine by me. They look good where they are Actually, this looks a lot better than what it was before And it roots to tree and tree stump There were no roots there before holy shit Maybe a brighter yellow not sure blue outfit there. Yeah, or like green blue I just been seen for me blue. It means something different than it does for like normal people when I mean blue. Ah, I mean like move to hue further into like 0x7 0 or something like that Move plants around and it's a tree. Okay shaved off some police here and there he shaved up some police. Yeah What did he do that? Wait, where are the monkeys? Where did the monkeys go I hear them I Should I might be even like 180 coins, but yeah, it's because we'll have just seven stars Some area give the little guy some food meet in the area grass instead of dirt Replace the rock stem thing near the house with a little pivot could be made bouncy or squishy true Remove the flower patch, but I'm all leaves around the place. Yeah, that's pretty nice Replace Teddy replace the tree of the scratch pole modeling trees as hell or on earth plus why is there even a tree here? No, I'm gonna work that would be but she should chomp it like this Yeah, I like that so that's also to do for note for me Chomp Sure chomp the pole and chomp should bounce on pillow and Chomp should jump through Not showing where you're supposed to climb on it, but I'll figure it out maybe even have a bouncy toy nearby But to climb on the pole Yeah, that's honestly that's a good point. It's kind of difficult to get on there Right to jump one shots me right now Damn that's really FC 7b 1e. No, that doesn't really happen Who's spamming all the fish flushed in notes there what the fuck is going on Team jumps are meant to be dogs. They are I guess they're cats as well now Yeah, how are you supposed to jump the folder maybe with a long jump like that I Don't know I Kind of don't like how shitty this gate. Oh wait, the gate is not even part of firebacks new model. Oh good This gate is an object. So it's not in the level Goomba area made floor grass here See that Added more flower patches for fun changed weird houses into huts. They were supposed to be hot Updated tree leaves Updated placement of plants. I tried working tree, but it was fucked up. I give up I hate trees Yeah, that's fair. I think the tree looks fine though shops and shopping center updated shacks looks Oh The signs are still the same mostly though Updated value to sign backgrounds. Yeah, that looks good to me If only G a kitchen with rotating taco meat and sauces It's taco meat. That's a kebab It looks good, though I Had a funny sign. Yep Think why don't you should do something having him there without the purpose might confuse the player Maybe he should be able to sell you for your taco or maybe he intentionally makes you a tacos It's so spicy maracas and loses a health point Hmm Yeah, it's kind of a good point But can't volunteer do that's not useless Think we don't create another except copy wrong make sure yeah, I'll just make the exact same thing again I Wait, you want the same heck but without the special moves, why don't you just play this sec without specials? What? So no bar to to the tire swing Yeah, I am like probably updated the model. The model was made when I thought poly cons budget was very tight. So All right the aquarium Let's see the aquarium See this is already a very very good start. Oh But something's pretty weird with the unagi here now he's got some transparency going on Let's fix that Wait, what that's not what I'm seeing when I entered this What am I going crazy? Am I going insane? Why is the unagi flipped? Huh? Is it supposed to be by color I Supposed to kind of our bite color I should just fuse it by a mic. There is no purpose in having that be a separate thing. So that's easier We Compile the level maybe but what's that gonna do? No, it's a very easy fix guys. I don't need any advice here. I think it's supposed to be color There we go, you're not used fixed But why is this body like that this must be like oh you set them to transparent They're opaque Why is this a transparent deco wait, that's the eye texture on there Why is this is eye texture Oh This is all one texture But this can't be a transparent decal I Yeah, I have to do the same thing here then That's that's not eight coordinates Okay, that would go. I Think it's fair Okay All right talking to shit doesn't work right now, but it looks like it's done in the right position The unagi is just different for decor But the unagi has one issue and that is that it allows you to just skip to the end of the aquarium here now So we might have to pull up this wall here to just be all the way to the top. It's not a big deal All right, I still think these look a bit stupid but that's fine I guess The wind fish is here. Yeah, the various sub looks very good. I Don't know what this sign is gonna be For but it looks very cool as well blooper blooper looks very very dead he's a dead boy i like this the glass is kind of hard to see in the aquarium it's almost like they're just kind of floating in the air yeah i think we need like some kind of reflective material on that yeah i think the glass needs to be more effective you would wait you what if you're reading change talk oh it goes on oh shit i thought that was just like the whole aquarium was just one sentence all right let's see that again up the edit lights and lighting above the fish panels and wind fish painting okay update the geo slightly so it aligns with the checkerboard bed on the floor i like that move some elements to reduce clutter okay enter the small aquarium display under the stairs have a sign that says treasure planted from the depths text box break for comedic effect of another aquarium updated the squid to look more like it does in sunshine yeah replace the submarine with creation of the sub farine from mario and shank it edit little planks where the signs were because they looked out of place little planks blocks blocks where are they box oh is it supposed to be here i think it's supposed to be right there and i'm just not getting it yeah i see i see i see i agree that looks a lot better they were just not rendering all right i know why they weren't rendering it's because um the opacity rounded down to more i think easy fix all right farmer one updated textures and lighting updated aquarium decoration yeah that looks a bit better than what it was before uh have a sign that says treasure planet from the depths text where we wait i already read that read it squid sign on side of a drum i thought it looked a lot better replaced higher platforms with metal catwalk the metal catwalk doesn't look pretty good but yeah the glass is near invisible here and the water is invisible too i think those two are an issue i think this should be like a reflective material the glass let me try that yeah that's a little better maybe like give it a tint of blue like a very light tint a light blue tint i can do that yeah actually what if it was not even a texture color but just like a primitive color you made it an nth map oh it didn't show us an nth map i mean if you can find a way to put some fingerprints on it i think it would work true that would work maybe there's someone's coffee stain on the glass you remade the entire squid wow could have an unagi swimming in the tank i don't think the unagi fits there not even varu would be that cruel to put him into such a small room do you guys remember how long it took to make the aquarium the first time yes we were on it for a pretty long time we probably spent like three four months just making the aquarium every day also to add to your point i don't think wario wants to spend the money to make an aquarium big enough for unagi yeah oh i didn't know we changed the zoo name i thought wario's wildlife world no wario's wildlife world is a lot fitting yeah i should probably change the little entrance sign then if that's the case yeah i mean the overall is going to be completely remade anyway so doesn't really matter right now and this is still having weird transparency issues so yeah i imagine this was like a lot of work holy shit all right there we go did you like it's fixed so good dementia can you stop speaking like fucking spanish or whatever that is all right room two oh wait i didn't even i didn't even fucking look at the aquarium what am i fucking stupid all right i think the walls look a little better the top is maybe a bit too opaque and it should scroll a little i think just give it that nope i don't think that would be good at all depth it would look very unusual update textures and lighting oh my god the lighting looks so good in here reworked aquarium geo and layout a little okay so we got a high up thing there did he change any of the splines in the aquarium that the fish swim along oh god is the manta swimming backwards i think the mantas are swimming backwards are they the one in the water let me check what's going on there now i see dude my mouse is alive and it's on it keeps moving you didn't okay i think some of the splines might have to change because they keep going to random positions on the spine and some of the positions might be inside the walls now my right leg doesn't work again what is this hello let me select the thing thank you oh no the spine is actually just outside of the aquarium wall what about this one nope also just outside okay perfect the geo happens to just work perfectly you can now go through the vents to get to the aquarium instead of having a random ass entrance there wait you're supposed to go down here wait what oh oh you made them look like vents yes okay i like this a lot okay right this is still the old collision map so yep that looks very good recommend cover for decoration replaced wooden platform with metal catwalks i like that too oh this looks so good damn that's pretty i i just have to find the entrance here oh there we go metal catwalk oh this is gonna sound so satisfying treasure room that's the next room i tell you you kind of just like do this then you come out here this is where vario keeps his money after just taking advantage of every animal in the world sick new custom handmade coin pile textures this one here is custom made or not this one is this one looks very good star should now be in chests oh star should now be in a chest chest object can be found in kofra.blend oh and we just remove this part here i'm up for that to just remove this and after star be here so you just kind of like plan the various thing i think we should do that i second your idea send you the blend on discord ah for kofra and cool eel what's cool eel for so i think i'll just do this and then remove this part here see a remade so it looks more like it's modern design yellow if you want to use it anyway okay i need to look at that to properly understand that yeah we're not gonna work on this today we're all working on the zoo hello fergus well then dude half the time i right click it doesn't work what is this  why i need a new mouse welcome to the case mouse unboxing stream this mouse is fucked i think your blender's just fun no this mouse is fucked case my uv maps i'm fixing them what did i do oh i see that better kinda doesn't even look that off honestly it might be my blender i'm just gonna open and close blender and see if that fixes it so maybe i don't need the new mouse right now i i'm pretty sure it was it was a blender issue so i'm making a closed wall it shouldn't be a case the players can see the gold link from the first room hiring at the secret room if they explore nah the mission is named like aquarium exploration or something like that yep i think so too some guy so now we just found the coffer chest should be opened by punching it from the front not the other side so the animation will look weird okay if we do that then the chest needs to glow though so the player will actually think to do that perfect blend has two animations one for opening and one for punching from the wrong side uh they are one after the other because i don't know if you can make two separate missions for the same object you can maybe keep the star where it was but i think it's more fitting to have it in treasure room true perhaps for a nice egg or an npc where the star was before if you see look at the coin pile them it does look really good what kind of texture did you use a ci8 wow i've already checked the file it looks open enough all right that sounds promising i don't have the file yet looks very open uh okay so you can kind of see the star then you punch it open like that why not annihilate the bones Biobak does such weird things to the blender files that i don't understand how do i look at the bones do i got the bottom face i can easily add that don't worry about that i don't understand how i'm supposed to look at the bones here oh well there's one thing i want to change in the animation because one thing that looks a bit weird is that everything falls back at first and then when it's here it slightly turns forward and the top part comes forward as well and then the top part falls from the back that's kind of like momentum doesn't work um various prison all right let's go to various prison next oh shit we might not be able to enter various prison right now i think i might have to repair some of my code before we can enter various prison so it looks really natural to you right now let me show you the two animation frames you'll definitely see what i mean so like we punch it this is all good this is good this is good this is fine fine fine and now it slows down here and this part here comes forward right and then right here you see how this also moves forward a little and then it falls again like it slows down and then it goes super fast again that's what's weird to me yeah i can't talk to him anymore and i need to talk to them to enter various thing we also need to remake the whole finish map for everything basically it's going to be a decent bit of work here i'm probably doing that off stream this week you see a gate here but the way it makes it fall back yeah but then there should be an acceleration and it shouldn't be so fast so okay we need to figure out why i cannot talk to the penguins right now or why i can't talk to anything at all It shouldn't be hard to figure out. Because I did make this change recently but I didn't think that would do this. Oh, I see. I see what's happening. Even this might not work properly. Shit. It's because of the behavior script comments setting our interaction subtype to 0. When we set the interact status to 0. Yeah, like right here it sets the thing to 0 again. That's not good. Don't wanna give a whole field to this. But I might have to. That sucks. What thing? Oh, it's Mari's dance. Wait, I'll show them. Zena's making a dance for Mari right now that plays in like one spot in the game. He's doing a little bit of a shuffle. I spent half the day yesterday learning how to foot shuffle. And I almost got it right, I think. Yeah. And I think this can still be improved a bit. But it's going a lot better because Yoshi Milkman and Zena's IK rig are godsend. And they deserve a medal for that. Classic case, changing stuff without checking, yep. And I will keep doing it. Because if I spend all my time checking my code, then I just have no time left. Well, am I supposed to just play the entire game every time I make any change? That is completely unreasonable. And we barely lose time from this because I know exactly what I changed. And I can just go and fix it. Let's see. Let me just put this to 3C. We're gonna be streaming individual frames. What? Oh, right. Mari's animation will be streaming individual frames. Yes, yes. You can make it as long as you want. It is the Mario Odyssey games. I completely forgot that we're gonna be streaming frames soon. See? I already fixed that. Wait, I can make the dance longer? You can make it as long as you want. Because we're basically using a new technique where instead of loading the entire animation at once, we're loading individual frames of the animation into memory. So as long as there's card space, you can just keep going. Huh, alright. What? Sometimes you feel lazy when you want to check something. And so various stuff can happen if you don't check. I probably look perfect. It's not about being lazy. The lazy thing to do would be to check everything. To just play around in your game. The non-lazy thing is to actually just remember. Checking the entire game would have taken longer than just fixing it. That's an issue. Mario's prison. Updated lighting and text. Just raised the ceiling and rooms on because the camera is feeling too claustrophobic. Made the room one primary color because why not. Alright. I see a bit of an issue though. I have to check if this is my mouse or not. We're going to the desktop. One, two, three, four. It didn't do it. One, two, three, four, five. It didn't do it. It's the mouse. My mouse is fucked. We need a new mouse. A new mouse? Yeah. See, I'm actually pretty smart with my mice. I have like a $10 mouse. And I always have one in store. So when one breaks or gets bad like this one here. I can just switch to the next one. And now I'm just going to order a new mouse. And if this one breaks, I instantly have a new one. I don't have to put up with this piece of shit. Let me just plug in the new mouse. I call this... What is it called? Pipelining mice? I call this pipelining mice, guys. Do I have to order you a new mouse? Yeah. Always one in store. You know what? What if I just ordered you two of them? No. No? Just one? It's a waste of money. Okay. Shit, the cable on this one is short, I think. Let's just go.  Alright, we have a new mouse. It's the Logitech T7 Wired Gaming Mouse. T7 Wired Gaming Mouse? Dude, imagine if what I just did... Imagine if they did that on the submarine. They could have survived. Oh my god, this mouse is so slow! What is going on? Oh my god.    Okay. There we go. Alright. Raise the ceiling. Make the rooms one primary color because why not? Oh my god, this feels so nice. Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Ah, it works! It works. Replace billboarded plants with real plants because what the fuck was up with that? There were billboarded plants here? Oh, these are real plants, I see. Oh, these look nice. I like these fucked up ones. Replace nice looking beds with the shittiest mattress on earth? I thought I already had the shittiest mattress on earth. That's a terrible sell. The order. T7 Wired Gaming Mouse. T7? It should be like $10. Nah, you get the wrong ones, I'll find the right one. Okay. Seeing that Andras post about the S-character room and saying, Oh, I did not know anyone else was doing this. Not what from what. What? I have no idea what you're talking about. Okay. Make the bars of the Yoshi coins all bend and stuff. Be careful. Okay. Oh, I see. Oh, that looks cool. I like this a lot. Move stuff around in the cells? These definitely look very shitty. With the dripping pipe and everything. Is the graffiti still there? Or some of it? Hopefully. Wait, where are the graffiti? Did you remove them? I can't imagine Biomag would remove graffiti. They just don't render. Oh. Oh, I see why they don't render. This should be rendering again. Oh. Wait, what? What does he have an all-in-one for? That's nasty! Wow, that is 4K and ray-traced. Yeah, it looks like a prison. I can see the ray-tracing right in front of my eyes. Make the prison cells big cages. The bombs are kind of fucked. Yeah, that's fine though. Those prison cells are big cages. Holy shit. This looks grim. Update to the floor. Wall geo very slightly for aesthetic purposes. Yeah. Looks pretty nice. We got rid of the trash pile, which honestly, good call. The trash texture did look very bad. Didn't work out at all, unfortunately. Is that the one I made? Yeah. I did my best with it. It's hard to make a trash texture. Yeah. Rounded pillar things are now piles of boxes. Yeah, that looks more appropriate. Very slightly move the exit bar and the decorations here and there. The decorations are... I think I made those cuts in a lot. Oh, the floor tiles are nice though. And the piping is nice. I see one graffiti. Saw one. Oh, it's moved very, very slightly here. What? Okay, this is a bit of an issue. Yeah. That's definitely not Biobak's fault. This is 100% my fault. This should make me go through. Yeah, it's because we are between two animation formats, I think. And the old animation format has that issue. Yeah. Yeah, exactly, Lilo. And it's on the last room I sent you to. Makes sense. Yeah, yeah, I know. I know exactly what you're talking about. Wait, how much delay do I have? Okay, guys, I need you to type go as soon as I count on. Okay? 3, 2, 1, go. Type go. I want to see the delay. 10 seconds? Wait, why is Zayn not the only one who typed go? Did you type go now? That's like 20 seconds. Oh my God, we have so much delay. Holy shit, that's like a minute. Oh, that is devastating. A minute of delay. Ouch. Okay. We just turned the AAA slider all the way to the right, I guess. Let me see. I don't see the stream settings. Okay, I missed the chat. Guys, YouTube just said no chat for me. Under stream latency, check your latency. It's not here. Wait, am I even live? Oh, I'm back here. That was not a minute. That definitely was a minute for the latest person. Latency check. Yeah. See how it takes a minute for me to just read that out for you now on your screen? It should be an OBS. It's not an OBS, I'm pretty sure. Okay. I had to call this a live stream when I have a fucking minute of delay. Oh no. Well, whatever just happened shouldn't be happening. Also, this wall here needs to block the camera. Oh, it does. Oh, wait. Okay. Nope, this one does not block the camera. It needs to block it for real. The mice are gone? Okay. Where's my tiny little mouse guy? Hey, there he is. He's still a little easter egg. You know what? I'm happy with him. Get the mouse. Just a little pixel mouse. Renegated the mouse to the rank of an easter egg. Yep. Added lamps. Oh, that really looks like a prison cafeteria now. That's a very cute idea. I don't know if I want to program that. Oh, that's a trash can. Very nice. I do.  That would be very funny. But I need to close this because otherwise you can see and render the void. Oh, that was very close to one side. Damn, someone threw the whole tray in the trash. Ario's office. Fancy that place, I find it very funny that the entire place is fucked up except for his office which is immaculate. Fuck. It's a troll door as well. You're right, that is a very funny concept. Oh, and he's just sitting here and sleeping instead of here. Alright, I'll just move him here. Hmm, you can go for waltz with hecka debug, well that wouldn't be hard to implement either, I just never figured that that would be necessary. Someone to help you with modelling? Yeah, it's mostly Biobak. I mean, Xena has made a few models but I think Biobak has now reworked all the models Xena made. No, Wario's a very deep sleeper, he would never wake up. My PC specs is, I think 32GB of RAM and a 3660 graphics card from Nvidia and a processor. I know for sure there's a processor in here. So... Fast impact 2? No. I think some of these items should be on Wario's shelf, like a bank of coins or other goodies, weren't they? Nah, fuck the power supply, the PC needs none. Alright, I got replaced cake with garlic. I like that, he just has a plate of garlic. Oh, it's plate, it's not rendering great though. That needs to be a transparent decal. And it doesn't need any culling here. Added a lamp. Oh yeah, nice lamp. Added windows, okay he can have windows. Big carpet. Added a Fury Stag. Picture of Hen. The Hen, Noro's famous sidekick. I have never seen this. Toffee from Mario Kart, Arcane GP2's Wario Cup. Oh, that's really cool. Golden Wario Cup from Wario Get It Together. Earthdash from Super Mario Party. Is that... okay, that's from the newer Mario Party game. Okay, I'm not sure how sold I am on these games.    Because these are like post N64 era, you know. They are very cool though. Uh, Wario painting from SM64DS. Oh, that's really cool too. I like that, I like that reference. Where he's now sleeping in his chair instead of on a table. Removed the table by the way. Right, there was a table that Wario used to sleep on. That's weird. No, I modeled the levels first up though. But Biobak reworked it to look nicer. Right, I like designed the whole game with some help from Biobak and chat. I modeled the whole thing and then I sent it to Biobak who improves on it. I think they should stay based on the fact that they took me several hours to make. Oh, you made these? They're not just ripped? Damn. Wouldn't ripping them be easier? But yeah, I'm not opposed to letting them stay. Right, I mean you could easily make the argument that the later games were inspired by these cup trophies here. All right. We do need to collect two stars now to see the last few areas. So let me do that real quick. And don't worry about that Wario model. He's a bit messed up. Damn, this is not an animation at all. Oh god. So.  Interesting. Okay, we do need to fix that I fear. So. Clear object condition. Hmm. All right, how is it crashing in clear object condition? Something's just set to one. That shouldn't be happening. Hmm. 22614C. Why is it just knobs? There we go. LBU V0 from V0. LBU. Why would it load a single byte in this function? There's nothing in this function. It looks like it should be a single byte. Oh, num collided objects. Okay, so sp4 header next is zero. And. Oh, it's free. Oh, so this compiled into a jump table. I was just complaining into a jump table. This shouldn't be compiling into a jump table at all. Interesting. Okay. I have returned. Welcome back. This is a really weird thing for GCC to do. Why did it even? What? Is 0 a 0C? Okay. This is not the right function. No way. I must have looked on 22614C. 22614C update objects and list. That's more like it. And this is inline and this one is inline as well. Cool. Oh, let me put on the Mario Party OST again. Oh, five hours of nostalgic Pokemon OST. Why not? See, I still don't mind. 22614C. That might honestly be this function here. But it's so small. How can it be that? How could it ever be that? We're loading a number and it's set to 12. So one of these numbers has to be 12 as like a valid value. But none of these are ever set to 12. Is it not update objects and list? 22614C. 22658. It's exactly between these two. And we can find some Jarls in here. 225DD4. 225DD4 is KuroBJ update floor. I did get floor. Oh, KuroBJ update is in here. It's inlined. How is this inlined? You can't inline this. No, inlining this is a bad idea. Oh, no. All right, let's try that again. But without it being inlined. I did not mean to inline that. Holy shit. Well, I guess inlining it isn't that bad, but like it's also not really good. What repo do I use? My own. Did you ever see any Wario rigs? I think Biobak made some changes to it, but you can have it afterwards. I'll figure it out for you today, most likely. But then you want to do Bunad first anyway. Oh, I still have to finish one animation program and then he's done. Okay, so the crash is here again, but now we have a better point of figuring it out. So, not unexpected that the crash would be here. Wait. The behave cmd proc is zero. Oh, shit. The current behavior comment is being set to zero. What can that be? That means one of the object fields has to be set to something bad. Oh, no. This should be easy to fix. There should just be like a simple matter of RAM corruption. Wait. Oh, opacity is set to 2D. Okay, let me just find the behavior here. I need to set this. I don't think that the changes I just made would fix this, but I will try it. Yes, okay, so there's a thing going on where damage or current value used to be at OBJ plus 0x3. I don't think it was 3D. Oh, shit, where was it? 180. It was at 3D. And that is basically like exactly the size of the current object field numbers, which means that setting that value might cause the behavior script pointer to just become an invalid value, which would cause the bug that just happened. I don't stick Fingersmaster. Okay, so that was not it. It's gotta be one of these. Let's see if I have some septic outside of this file, because I might. So, wait, does this one get set to just one? I think if I just set this to 0x40 again, it will just work. Is there going to be an F3 this year? I don't know. I kind of want to make one. I kind of want to put in the work to make one, so it's weird. Yeah, the engine will be completely open source. The entire hack here will be open source. Wait, what if the behavior stack is being weird? What if that's what's going on? Nope, it's a very standard stack. I'm setting the home position, and home is like one of the latest ones, but that can't be it either. And why am I setting the home position on this? I don't need to. I don't think it's the co- Is it the collision? No, the collision is always 2A and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. It's unrelated to the penguin. I should also become invisible inside cannons. Yeah, so something is writing to object fields beyond. What it should, and I'm not sure where. Damn, but it being in the gate is a very good hint. I kind of want to figure this out now. Can't be unload collision model. Create sound spawner. No. I can type things to eat. I thought that's it. The exact type is set to 2A, don't vanish at all. 0x3E is used. That explains the crash. I guess I have to keep this at 0x40. Okay, we have found the issue. I'm not gonna ask anyone what they want made, I don't really care. I'm just making the hex that I want to make. If you want something made, go make it yourself. It's also weird to refer to people as fans. I think I have this weird thing going on, where unlike most YouTubers, I don't really have a parallel social relationship with most of my audience. But at the same time, I'm somewhat personal on streams and just talking to people in the community and stuff like that. So it's a mix between being beyond parasocial and actually being social and not being parasocial at all. While you go the long way around, I just wanted to see. Let's see the Antarctic. Suggestion for a gamepad based on personal experience. Doing this section 10 times in a row, because I always forget the save state. Make obstacles explode when you hit them. Being stuck in a corner for 3 seconds is annoying. Increase the timer requirement a little. 1 minute is a bit short, maybe 1m15s. REALLY? I always end with 15 seconds in the end! The fact that you get stuck in shit for several seconds is what makes it harder. Increasing the timer might not be needed if you fix that. You'll later spawn an individual fish in a wave by like 0.2s. They don't look like a huge block of fish. Make the plane roll more often going through a speed ring. They're often difficult because they give you less time to react to obstacles. Make the middle area of the plane larger, keeping the plane straight is way too precise. I'm okay with making the middle plane larger. And the thing about... Oh god, this looks so weird compared to what it was before. What the hell happened here? I don't like the change on this area here. I don't like the change on this area here. Oh, I know why this looks so weird. It's because the water doesn't scroll properly anymore with my speed. Oh, this is cool. And this is very trippy and weird. Oh, but the Antarctic looks cool. I like this.  Needs to be a lot more slippery. I'm besties with you, Case. We're all besties in here.  Every single one of us. The water not moving? Yeah, that was weird.  But we can fix that. Don't worry.  This is the entire Antarctic? This is just how it looks? That's crazy that I did this. Hmm... I think it's the set tile size once. That doesn't seem right to me. Why are the indexes so far out? Wait, is this used in multiple parts? Oh, it is. Oh, it's not. Wait, what the fuck is going on here? Is this part of an area? I don't think so. Can this go? Why is this separate textures? I don't know. I don't know. Why was this invisible? Oh, I just left my shitty old Antarctica in there just to say... ...look, Case, this is how shit yours looked. I don't know. Wait, Biobak, how did you do the plain section? Did you do it completely different from what I did here? How did you do it? Oh, yeah, I just deleted the collision. That's a really good point. Well then. I don't think I just go the short way. He smashes the car first. Then there's a weird animation with Wario. He's supposed to smash the car if... ...he just goes for it, yeah. That's like a thing that you can trigger on purpose if you want. Hello, ZeroWalt. Hi, Zero. Let's see. Let's see, I think I need to get the set tile sizes here. It's 1, 2, 0. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... ...11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 16 and 18 if I did this right. 16 and 18. Okay, let's also address... ...Biomech's issue of the... ...cheap chips being synced. That should be pretty easy to do. Yeah, so if I just... ...offset them a little... ...that should fix it. To be more like what he wanted. Alright, let's try it. It was Ethan. Did you ever want to do those videos... ...of like the ALS Iceberg Challenge... ...from my life? No, I don't really care about charity... ...so I'm not even going to make a video... ...pretending about it. I don't like... ...just pretending... ...to care when I don't. Even if that would make me look like a good person. I don't know if that makes me a worse person... ...or a better person. Oh yeah, this is looking way better. Oh wait! I know what else is triggering me here. The fog. The fog in the background... ...looks very different from the stage. The level needs to go into the same amount of fog there. It's not going to work out well... ...in my opinion. Hello! Hello from South Korea! Hello! Yeah, I don't really see the argument... ...about extending the timer. I just did it in 16 seconds. I'm going to go left. Somehow I didn't fix the textures at all. Did I even export the level? Oh. Change that? No. The fog is messing up the texture. Oh, this one here? This one doesn't even have fog. Global fog. Use global fog. What did you set as global fog? Alright. I don't care. You wanna? This is going to be weird... ...because... Yeah, wait. No, this shouldn't be weird. There's a chance that all the objects in here... ...used the wrong fog. The wall texture? Oh, these ones here. Oh. It really shouldn't... ...but it kinda looks like it. Oh, but if you add fog to one thing... ...then you need to add fog to everything... ...if you ask me. Okay. Let me do that. Okay. Wait, is this even supposed to have fog? Wait a second. I don't think this is supposed to have fog. ... Because most of these don't have fog. So why was that on? Very weird. It's my combiners? Yeah. What about them? Wait, what? Dude, this YouTube delay... ...is really impractical. Yeah. I don't do a dash. I'm not adding a Waluigi gun minigame. It sent me the new Wario model. Oh. But I'm pretty sure Biobak will change this... ...so don't touch it yet.  Biobak, if you can... ...can you send me the updated Wario model? Let me get a sec. I can send it to you... ...unless he hasn't sent it to me. Okay. Actually, I'm not even sure if he's updated it. If he hasn't updated it... ...then I can start Wario's animations. Do we just need a run cycle? And... There's also the sleeping animation, for example. The background just doesn't look good here. But it doesn't... ...look like this in the model. Compare them. So how can that be? I haven't changed them yet, so go wild. Alright? Alright. What's the next project I'd guess for breakfast? I am literally not allowed to tell you. Why is it so flat too? It's supposed to go up and down. Isn't it? Maybe not. No, I don't think it's supposed to go up and down. Okay. He's not doing Star Wars 2... ...because he doesn't want to. He's just being lazy. He'd rather just play games. My guess. Dude, I don't understand. There's no property here... ...that I see that would be doing this. It's literally just shade color... ...and it doesn't work. No wait, it does work. It's just a different color than this. Wait. The fog here is just white. That's the issue. Something is setting the fog to white. Oh, also... Oh, I see. Wait. I think... I think it's because... ...these colors are not actually equal. Maybe just the genre? I'm literally legally not allowed to tell you... ...anything about the game. Go bother Jonas or something. Maybe he's legal to tell you. Because he's allowed. Jonas can do whatever he wants. You have to ask him. Hello. Hello. Actually, I can't tell you... ...the genre of our next game. Our next game will be in the good game genre. Will be a good game. Come on, guys.  Just a little bit of an NDA violation. You can have a little bit of... ...an NDA violation as a treat, you know? Just go for it. Okay. I forgot about the fog preview. I forgot about the fog preview. I don't strep in moist this is gonna take a bit I can't believe you would break an NDA like that no don't tell my boss this is definitely a low poly model do you have to write rick can i see yes do you want to edit mod okay you do have to write rick that looks good to me okay we almost have to fuck right i think it needs to be even brighter that is true i take a lot more risk in my game than like what you would see in a nintendo game i also okay this is the thing that i'm somewhat adamant about i think modern video games are just like frustration minimized they like design themselves in a way that there's no risk to anything like there's no risk that any player could get stuck on anything and everything is like super easy to get through right that's like scrolling tiktok or something but it's like oh there's nothing great but there's also nothing offensive because modern games have realized that the really bad offensive parts is what gets people to hate games but just a bunch of mediocre shit and i guess people will like it so i try not to do that like i just refuse to subscribe to that i want my games to take the risks of just like oh there's a risk something doesn't work out for the player right away there's a risk that they get stuck somewhere and have to struggle at all to get past the obstacle i think pokemon is like the most guilty of this definitely pokemon but even like the new tears of the kingdom feels a little like that oh this looks nicer i think um pokemon kind of over corrected on that in some ways with the newer games like some of the older games had some frustrations to them but like it always felt good once you get past that right yeah and i mean pokemon games were already designed in a way that any frustration you would get lost in finite time like it's like the really big easy mode wasn't as much of a problem as it is now back then yeah i found the white and the big battle picked them up because they might get frustrated about missing a jump look that's yes that is making it easier but come on it's not like modern video games at all  like that more white but too bad it has to be like that or it doesn't fit together oh this one too this area i mean it originally was more white but like i i can't i i don't wanna deal with that yep the wall is just not fucking rendering the entire wall oh that would explain it yeah the one cycle fog thing you kind of uh all right that won't work now let's see what does the change look say you can change the texture i can't change the color but then i also have to change the other color again and the colors are not the same because this is stock shit this is this just the system we have to work with i'm gonna hack your ps1 i didn't know you could do that but good luck i want the hack ps1 okay well it should be accessible so players can reach the top area don't worry they will be super super sorry notice the clever way in which i hate seams on the walls by going into blue that is a clever way to hide them you know another way to hide the seams is to just not even make seams but actually that's not possible with the structure so this is a really cool way of doing that i like this a lot enter the landing strip from the plane and its achievement statues they're basic journeys for doing cool stuff in the flying minigame they don't affect gameplay or progress they unlock permanently they don't disappear if you leave the level of the game they're made with snow and stuff stone from royal level great looking diamond due to advanced combiner technology combiner technology here you heard it here folks okay i'm gonna make this an rgba 16 because that's better rtyi will have 15 worlds or well i guess like 30 but 15 main courses uh incomplete not yet unlocked centers are under the floor geo okay but how do you unlock them first statue is a big mario snowman it appears after you beat the final boss penguin in front of it says i'm building a snow city for mario but now it's gonna take me some time come check it out later once you unlock it there's a plaque at its foot that reads an honor of mario who saved our friends from the smelly prison second statue is a big trophy to be if you finish the race in 45 or whatever seconds or less finger in front of it says i'm making a set whoever beats the flying record of 45 seconds once you unlock it there's a plaque at its foot that reads an honor of mario flew over the ocean third city is another fancier trophy in a piece if you finish the race without taking any damage in front of it says i'm making a big city for whoever can get here without damaging the plane so again there's a black at its foot that reads an honor of mario's flying skills are unmatched depending on the plane that is more that was much more fun than i thought i'm gonna go again do you want to come with me so you can quickly restart the flight is around the house menu when in the minigame i really like the stake on like having it be like a proper minigame instead of just a mission i'm worried that people will actually expect to get anything useful out of these though because people might just keep restarting the game that's what i'm worried about but what do we do about that and he said he wanted a bigger neutral size actually having a bigger neutral size will make the plane harder to control not easier because you have to move further to do stuff let me clear the dialogue that's just for show of purposes all right i'm up for that so let me add that to my to-do list team uh reflects water refractions aquarium they make that i already know are so iconic i don't know why nintendo didn't have those ideas yeah i really like the course ideas we have in this game i think they're beautiful but right now it's way too precise to make deployment mistakes yeah you know what this this is something that we will figure out through testing but if you as an experienced player say it's too difficult i will increase it it's now a multiplayer be built-in feature will be a separate rom and will be built in making it a separate rom kind of feels like cheating to me you know i want it all in one rom oh no look what he did to the waterfall on accident wait the water looks really good why does the water look so good oh it's the same textures i think the waterfall should be a lot faster though let me try this so to stream i think some of them look really cool and like to see a reaction uh yeah i actually kind of want to stream longer i might just have to take a short shit so i might have to be gone for five minutes and then i can stream longer that sounds good to you guys we had a special photo album in the game especially rewards beating all the best is finishing trophies and couldn't unlock new last secret level uh i was planning to have like levels to unlock by donating a lot of coins to yoshis is this more like it i still think the waterfall looks weird i also think this area here looks bald you know what i mean it just looks bald like it's how do i do that so yeah so i think this is a lot better like that all right last area that Biobak needs let's see it updated shading so it's a bit darker into the corners like that wasn't mario supposed to be great skill in here he was i guess i have to bring that back uh make mario green scale i think you're slightly invented in what was that it was a yoshi licking sound what happened oh thank you for the subscription is that like a membership did you just become a youtube member oh the floor textures missed up oh some shit's definitely going wrong there wow interesting went into the floor and ceiling texture because the bricks looks weird let me see what the intention was it's a little more difficult but maybe i actually have a new system for that now i can't do that no the floor looks fine to me oh oh oh oh shit yeah that looks completely different dude why do you use like environment color alpha it's weird i think using environment color alpha is what screws this up in some places at least the problem with that is that you know the mario 64 presets that fast64 has they work in mario 64 but in rtyi there are some engine changes which means that you can't really just use nth color like that yeah yeah i recognize that maybe i should send you my material list i have a few more materials that are easier to use than that but basically it's always optimal to have the last column be 0 0 0 1 on solid materials hey i actually don't know why it messed up your model that much but here we are so i know what's going on with the lava that's not something you can control let me just make a note for that as well oh right i should probably say that this this right here what's happening to this is from the lava fix the 3d model glitching out dude the fire looks actually pretty pretty sick i do like the new shading and the new floor texture the new floor texture actually looks so much better but i wonder if it's not less faithful but at the same time who cares i'm pretty sure everyone still recognizes this pretty well as warrior's castle oh yeah the little shine here that's neat boss rush mode maybe all right do you want me to do the objects next biopack you can send them to me i'm just gonna go to i will be tasteful and say that i'm gonna go to the restroom be right back actually zayn i can entertain you guys it's this big time okay okay what are we drawing what are we drawing today okay i'm not gonna get you banned i promise okay what do we draw what do we draw um someone give me a prompt anyone his keyboard is very heavy okay um okay what what do we draw yes it's the zayna comedy show here we go all right so in today's episode wario being stinky okay very fitting because i'm working on his animations right now so yeah we'll just go with black we'll have our we're gonna go classic and just have the uh right i forgot um thomas the tank engine okay let's see we can draw one right here and i think i think he has like a one Man writing with a mouse is very hard okay a cat we can draw a cat i'm gonna make it blue we're just gonna his head he's got ears i think he's got eyes oh god these eyes are terrible a nose i cannot draw with a mouse yeah perfect you know what he's he's a loaf cat i've decided that he's a loaf cat yeah he's a loaf okay and bio back wanted roryo being stinky okay do it hold on let me see if i can draw him from memory he's got like kind of these weird looking eyes and eyebrows he's got a very big nose i think his stash is very spiky if i remember correctly he's got like this weird butch in here i know his ears are pointed so did i make him fat enough maybe honestly he's kind of looking like waluigi but i think that's fine like we can just give him some hair yes yes oh god he is he is so he's got pretty muscular arms i think his gloves he wears like a t-shirt big big strong beef okay i didn't mean to make wario jacked as fuck i don't he's supposed to be fat not jacked but it's fine we can we can just pretend that he works out elephant mario okay where do i post my art i posted on twitter and instagram under the legend of zana i shouldn't be hard to find his overalls yeah he probably has like this is the kind of crazy man that eats garlic straight so he probably stinks of garlic just like these little stink bubbles stink stink things okay and i know he's like really round but he also has like really tiny legs i did not get his shoes right but that's fine very very stinky wario beautiful okay was it elephant mario we had uh-oh i think i think case is coming back no let me draw elephant mario i mean elephant mario here's looking kind of cursed like he's seen some shit okay somebody clip this for me before before i get yeeted off of the off of mspaint yep i have a lot of cursed things here today okay cool someone clip this okay i'm ready why are you so that's not what i was expecting you usually just like pull me off the chair okay okay i am not a piece of food you know i don't belong on the table oh okay that was fun all right welcome back guys nintendo hire me hire me as your artist i hope somebody clipped it all right bio bag you send me anything okay zooobjects.zip here we go ah yes domestic violence oh no i think she is not food no she is are you turn those muscles oh she thinks she's not food yeah you're like probably like 20 kilograms of protein uh-huh i can make an entire steak dinner with the muscles you have i can eat you i like that game is it possible to just take the frame map and just grayscale the whole thing so that hot elements yes it is but that is not very efficient and it's gonna not work on most emulators hello dm i actually have a rome called grayscale mario 64 i made that because wise guy said it's gonna lag it didn't fuck him the one time he was wrong oh that's a cute animation oh no so there we go oh my god this model is so old that i have hardcoded paths send me the new one oh okay what i don't remember that you don't remember what the war on to me common what war on me what does that mean i don't know i don't know what that means and i don't remember you ever saying that maybe you did i don't remember saying that i hate this layout i can't even see which animation this is oh well this should work all right let's check out if the blooper worked fine oh yeah by the way guys we are bringing back monthly testing so i'm gonna prepare one course a month and we're gonna have one person test the course just like a rom with just the one level in it and hopefully we can analyze the gameplay and see how it goes against our expectations to make sure that the game is gonna turn out good so i need someone to test course one but i'm not sure who to pick yet because one is the only one that's ready yet after that i'll be course two and so on that's all i'm probably only gonna pick courses that have already been reworked by Biobak just so we don't waste any time on versions that are not actually the final version yet oh this definitely needs to collision then this allows this can you rotate the bloopers by chance or no the bloopers always go sideways don't they oh holy fuck the hitbox is big what the hell no the hitbox is attached to the bottom oh it's because this bone is in the sky oh my 64 coordinates are 65 so this will fix it yeah only one person i can't watch more than that might want to update the timing on their jumps let me see oh yeah you're right this has dynamic programming attached why can i not oh there we go oh the first bone isn't animated at all interesting so the jump happens on frame 16 do hmm i think this code was not made for this animation here well actually this is from 14 game is that a benji kazooie turtle nope can i squish before jumping yeah you're supposed to do do do this shouldn't do it let's make sure they work fine uh what did i do wrong here let's also change the gesture well it's been enough pain now i wish we had a test overworld for the first overworld instead of what we have right now honestly do when you squish before jumping yes or the answer becomes the crap out of the source but i'm gonna give performance benefit no it puts the console in the pss region of the object file after c compiles i don't think that changing something to const changes where it's or i'm not sure maybe it does but to answer your question yeah there are some performance benefits from making stuff const because the compiler can assume that there was no aliased right to that thing for example and it can assume that it stays constant between function calls right the more assumptions the compiler can make the more optimized the program's gonna be so i just went into the floor what is this i can jump as attendant but like still doesn't seem good to me i also need a minimum position they don't have a minimum position that is odd how do they survive without a minimum position so the mission made them backwards by the way i changed it maybe i shouldn't have but you can always rotate them and post i think they were meant to jump like side to side oh but this is forward that's weird i just set the face chart to the move jar then this should go forward now i don't know how they rotate it at all oh i see okay easy fix this was the issue so i'm fine hard coding a position for these because that's fine it doesn't make a difference they only used here so there are still some weirdnesses with the animations i think so let's check if the time was less than two here and why would i check if the time was more than 30 here so this makes little sense oh they have a home position and they aim somewhere around their home position and that is what sets their minimum position basically okay in that case i just need to sanity check this do something much slower do and it is after 65536 collision limit in the hack because i'm remembering the rest of this is going to go on forever and that's not a limit nothing's stopping you from making collision going on forever it's very easy to just change the data type change the game by mario palette for the 8-bit map since we showcased it in that video now the reason it no longer has a greyscale mario is that the whole mario model was reworked to use instead of shade color so we can have world lighting so i have to remake that where the bloopers are They are in the sky, aren't they? You know what, I think I should make a new random function I think the one we have right now is not great I'll make a node Hey, there they are All right, that looks good to me One thing I don't like about this is this animation here It should not be doing these things Where it loops the animation over and over All right, on to the next one This one has me a bit concerned It says that you combined the materials for the chain chomp Okay, he looks a lot better Remove the material by making teeth and body the same texture So how many textures does he have now? Still three Yeah, that's gonna actually make this more laggy Because now it's a bigger texture And we have to reload the texture anyway Not that it really matters, but like Wait, is this even the texture? Oh, that's not even the texture Never mind, this is perfectly fine Let's see There's a weird overlap here in the animation What the fuck? I guess there isn't much we can do about that, is there? Wait what? What is this? No, I guess this is just what it is Yeah, okay, it makes sense This is better, I agree It'd be different if it was textures, but this is materials So this is good I just wanted to say thank you for responding to my tweet about which flash can you use for RNG I'm saying the same thing as England's rate limiting everyone I didn't know that there was a limit on Twitter That's funny Yeah, the file name is gone Didn't do anything to the animation, okay Yeah, that's my own thing Don't worry I did that Wait, why is this called Cloud VG? What did I do to the Chain Chomp? Did I even export the Chain Chomp? Chain Chomp Geo I never actually exported the new Chain Chomp Geo I didn't even know Interesting Okay, let's not import this for now because I'm sure there was a reason Move on to the next one, Chain Chomp Door Chain Chomp Gate Update the log edit, another model for the doors When they're open, it's weird to say I've exported the Vault of Existence Oh, I see Well, they should be opening it the other way because the Chain Chomp is going through it All right, I'm fine with this, I think It looks a bit flimsy to me I also need to make a collision for it Let's see, it looks very good, all right I'm a believer Let's check it out I'm honestly sad people didn't start complaining about Tears of the Kingdom's price on Twitter I was so ready for like the banger tweet of the century, but it never happened Interesting There's a little bit of an issue here It snaps to the closest again, doesn't it? I don't know how you live your life like that I can't deal with it I didn't realize it was gonna be so big, so I have to make the collision a bit more detailed I don't know what caused the issue still, by the way, but I'm trying this No people complaining about the new Sonic being $60 because it's silly To be fair, the new Sonic doesn't look like a $60 game It just looks like the same game they've made a million times already It shouldn't be $60, that should be free, basically Like you should be grateful anyone still plays that shit at that point Should be expecting nothing for it Fuck him I hate Sonic That doesn't wrap- Oh, I see, that makes sense Damn, and I just fixed it on accident All right, I'm not gonna import the other dog for now Varkar and Varkar Broken Let's see that This one's gonna be a cool one That looks the exact same Looks like they've improved the environment a little The environment in the game is very anticlimactic Is this the same one? Am I going crazy? I'm just gonna assume it looks better Surely it does Just say that it looked good Ah, okay Varkar Broken The way it makes the game is very anti-climactic So I should probably jump on it, ignore it, and the mission should be hidden in a big puff of smoke like this I see what you mean And originally, the car was being destroyed like that But it was for a different mission A mission that doesn't exist anymore So I don't really, you know, it's just kind of like a little bonus thing It's not supposed to be like the main part of the mission It's just like a thing that happens As I go, I already have the asset, I might as well make that happen So I don't want to put in the amount of work required to make this nice smooth transition like that Unless I am just bored at the end of the development Tire swing Wait, where's the tire swing? My blinds Did you forget the tire swing? It's better when you do it the long way around to be honest Maybe find something to replace from doing it the other way Ah, okay That would make sense I can just program the chain jump not to go up there But yeah Send it now All right, let me get that Downloads Tire swing Eh, my text just Penoy? I bet that means tire in French Right there, okay So just look harder I'm gonna look so hard My eyes are gonna pop out Oh shit, I sent you the banana model too The banana mission is gone The entire mission is just no longer existing Rip And can you send it to me with the text just file? Bet it's like the stream delay Look at the rope geo on the original model What the fuck is that case? I think the rope geo was really weird Because we needed it to be that way for the tire swing to animate I think that was a good reason for it It's a smaller file now Dude, Blender's magical Oh, okay You know what? Yes Fair point This is fucked up All right, let's check out if the tire swing still works in-game Undefined reference to tire swing tie-in 001 mesh protects Uh-oh Oh, no Oh no Okay so because you made these one material It's a lot harder for me to identify what is what Oh, but that should be fine Honestly, it should be fine I'm just gonna be a few more vertices to Iterate Also nice little optimization here What's better for my spice 230 by 30 or 132 by 64 And the 132 by 64 is better by a very very small margin What you really save a lot is when you have an armature that has multiple textures And you reduce texture counts on that Because the textures otherwise have to keep being reloaded Like if you have a Goomba and you can model the whole Goomba in a single texture That will do amazing All right, but still works fine And it looks a lot better now It looks so much better I like it It's pretty nice It is fine if you don't want to answer Wow What a guy He gives you an out He's holding you on gunpoint but saying it is fine If you're making palace remove tongue not really need it What the fuck is the combiner set up Yeah, the combiner was really funky I think it had something to do with our Dory usually as fuck And I wanted to keep having that But that was obviously a stupid idea Sorry, it's just a fucking lawn Oh, I see I don't know how that happened Wait, what? What's that 0-0-5? Oops, off the bad word that don't correspond to a bone Offset 0-0-5 How is there even an offset 0-0-5? What? Wait, is this because of fast64? Oh no The fast64 update ruined this Okay, so the fins look fine Did this model used to work? But I think one of the fast 64 updates just made it so that this average is not valid anymore. That's kind of frustrating. I don't like organic terrain. Damn, then the oil rig is gonna be perfect. There's like no organic terrain at all in there. Right? Someone sub? Delin just subscribed. Is that like a YouTube sub or is that like an actual sub? An actual sub. Oh okay, I'm not even gonna question that. I'm gonna go in game and I'm gonna look at Dory and I think I will be in for a very bad surprise. Well, it might not necessarily have been a regression. It might have just been a random change, you know? What is Dory doing? Wait, I know what Dory is doing. Oh, she's just spinning in place. Oh, she went to the water. Someone's doing this. Yep, yep. I know exactly what you're gonna send me. Yeah. Didn't you say the ice thing was gonna just send you into the sky? That doesn't happen for me. Now it's only lasted 30 seconds. The ice cap works perfectly. All right, well I guess Dory works fine. That's weird. So, in the random events where she goes to the waterfall should happen more frequently, I guess. Actually, this is fine. Banana. Okay, we don't need the banana, but the banana is actually used in other levels, I think. Oh, but it's not on here anyway. Okay, good. Cheep, cheep. Oh, he looks stunned. Poor guy. Made him depressed. He lives a sad, boring life in Vary's Aquarium. Reduce model to two textures. We made armors and animation. Animation hitches at the end, but I don't know if this is my PC being lucky. Let me see. Oh, I know why. Look, if you want to make the animation not hitch at the end, you have to make it cyclic. Like that. That looks really good, though. Yeah, you can make it cyclic by pressing shift E. Oh, boy. I'm depressing looking fish. They're also facing the wrong way. Alright. We have a few changes to make. So, this is not how it was before. Why is it so different when I do that? That is bizarre. Well. I can just fix this in code, don't worry. So, why were his sides black? Must be this. There's also this environment color thing again. Can't have that. What's the primitive color for? Oh, I see. That's kind of cool. I like that a lot. That's a cool combiner. So, all right, they should be good now as soon as I fix this. Wait, that's not the bug. Oh, yeah, yeah, I get the primitive color now. We blame it on delay. Even though that doesn't make any sense, we blame it on delay. Is it a hot thing if your two favorite Pokemon animations are three and five? No. Honestly, mine are one and four. They're not so big. I don't want them so big. Oh, they have no shading. Them having no shading looks a little weird, I find. Although, I guess it's fine in an aquarium. I'm not sure. Oh, this is where they're scaled. So, I have a thing in my code that scales them, so I can make Cheep Cheeps in the aquarium have more variety. I remembered just now. Okay, I will do that. I mean, they're still not really gonna have directional shading, but they're gonna look a little more like they belong into the world. There's a weird line here on the floor. Just four cheeps chasing each other. What the hell? All right, now let me multiply them with a very slight cyan. Oh, it's not seamless anymore now. Why is it not seamless here? That is weird. Oh, it wasn't seamless before either. It again. Oh, wait, you meant shade color, not color. Whoops, let me just switch that up. This kind of looks like it makes them darker. Oh, god. Yeah, I think this puts them better into the universe. But if I said ginger and false false and minimum, well, we're kind of terrible start, but they fix most of them. Yeah, I mean, you didn't ask me for what I thought was the best, you asked me for my favorite. The best and my favorite are two very different things. Yeah, terrible stream delay, unfortunately, but I think I got it now. I'll just leave them open in case you have any more things to say about that one that you want me to change. Oh, the cannon is missing, too. Oh, wait, no pangokannon here. Oh, yeah, that looks good. Ship it. Why is everything culling enabled by default? Wooden boat. Oh, that's such a cool idea. Hmm. One of them is collision, the other one is visual. What's the difference? I guess there isn't really any. There's just too many unique color formats to fit into CI8. That one is visuals. Yeah, but they had the same polygons. Am I crazy? They both had 28 polygons.  I'll do this. That's how it was on the OLG model. I'm not making notes. Fair. I think this makes it a bit more climbable. Table. Time for the table. Beautiful. It's the same collision model, or did you make a new one? I'll just export both, just in case. I bet this one has culling on the cannon. Oh, my god. How many things are there with culling on that are just ruined? Does the blooper have culling? Oh, my god. That's... You basically always want culling off in Fast64. It's not a good option to have on. Culling kind of just loads 0x80 vertices for no reason. It doesn't do anything. Have you read the boat suggestions in the log? Is it a JRB boat now? If you have a polygon, yes. Maybe give him something to do. Maybe he floats randomly on the water. Maybe if you ground pound him, he sinks down like the JRB boat. Doesn't it sink down if you ground pound it? Doesn't it go a bit into the water? Did I mess that up? Or you mean you want him to fully just sink to the floor and always be there? That'd be funny, too. I could do that. Let's note that down. Make sure you make sure to sink above. Let me see. Yep, I have to disable it on this as well. Even on the broken car. All right. Table. Get that one in. Oh shit, I'm missing the textures. No. Yeah, I agree. That's a funny reference. That's why I want to do it. I need the broken table again. Baba attack. I see. Let's see that one. I hope it still has the- oh god. Does it still have to fuck? It doesn't have to fuck anymore.  yeah, but you don't use VcolorAlpha so I can just add the fuck. Good. Ablecent, alright. Wait, is he even animated? I don't think he's animated. Oh god, what is this? Why would I have done this? That must have been an accident. You animated him? Okay, so he wasn't animated before. Okay, looks good to me. Papatujo is his official name. So, this should work just fine if I just export it. Ah, good old Fast64 update that broke this, I think. This is bone1, bone0. So we just have the bone that doesn't exist, actually. Yep. Oh, he's just in a bubble folder, okay. Okay. Alright, let's see all these objects in-game. See if it works. Why is he white now? That's because Fast64 defaults to previewing with white fog. But in-game he obviously doesn't have white fog. He has the fog from the Antarctic. That thing's off. I can feel it. Is it dogging? That looks like it's dogging, doing that. Maybe not. Oh, the animation looks really good. But he's way too low. I know why he's so low. Wait, I don't. I have an idea why he's so low. Let me check. What? What? Mario back? What did you try to sneak in? Is that just the tiniest bone in the world? That's for bones? In my ROM hack? Unacceptable. I found a secret bone, that's all that was going on. So he's moved down like 50 coordinates here. And 70 here. So let's just offset him by 140, I guess. There's also one object that's just currently fucking up the render. I don't know which one it is. One of the render modes must be messed up. Of course it's an accident. When you think Biobak's doing that on purpose. Yeah, it just seems to kind of come from Norris' direction, that thing being messed up. Oh yeah, did you guys see this yet? Look at Mario's head when I jump. I think he needs to be even further up. Overall, I like how it looks. In the previous stream it was broken, I fixed that. There's a 64 bug that's currently causing that. Let's see if Dolly was the one causing the other graphical issues. After that we got everything in. That was honestly kind of painless. I thought this would take a lot longer. Except Wario's new animations. Actually, do some of the animations also need to be fixed? Yes, the animations will need to be completely remade. All of Wario's animations. Or what they mean. I have already done. I'm working on the run cycle. Oh wait, this is white. Okay, yes, you have a point. Oh, you did use shade color alpha. Shit. Yeah, we can't have shade color alpha used here. Can you live with... Something like this, kind of. Except... I'm trying to make him look the way you want. Without actually introducing shade color. Remove the fork on him then. But that's gonna look so bad. You can't just have one model without fork. It will just really look really, really off. I guess this is what you want. He doesn't spawn that close to Wario. I mean, we can try it without fork. And after that we still need to fix Dory. And I gotta look at the broken table. To see if that's fine. I honestly love that in this romhack. You can do a long jump. And instantly dive out of it. You can't do that in Mario 64. That one change. It's so fun for me. The hell? Oh. Right. Right. Right. He will start playing FNAF 9. FNAF 9. You're trolling me. There's no way there's 9 FNAF games. And there's no way you want to play 9 of those. Okay. That looks pretty good actually. I kinda like that you can see them beforehand now. It wasn't like that before. That makes it a bit easier. Honestly, that's an accidental change. But a good one. I encourage this. So why is Dory breaking my game? Wait, how is Dory breaking my game? I honestly don't see it right now. If you're gonna keep so that you can see them beforehand. Do you think it's possible to give them like water particle effects? Yeah, of course. But wouldn't it be possible? How did Dory cause my game to glitch out? Didn't we even look at Dory before and it worked fine? This... Feels like there's no way Dory would do that. All we did was remove culling on her. But suddenly it's completely fucked. Oh. That's why random range is so big too. Oh. Oh. We even have this. None of these are actually loaded, are they?  It's in DayaDayaDox. I fucked it up. I gotta delete it from DayaDayaDox now. Oh my god, I'm down to 8 gigabytes. My whole disk is just full of Biomex models. You need a bigger hard drive. Yeah. Okay. After this, we should have everything in the game. We should be fine. Yeah. They're really just... I always thought FNAF was just for like 11 year olds. I'm surprised people actually play those games. Yeah. I've tried playing... I think I watched someone playing it and it just looked insufferable. Yeah, okay. I guess I still need some of these. Oh, yeah. I definitely need some of these. I have to change them right there. That's just for now. Oh, there we go. Oh, okay. There we go. Yeah. This is more like what I expected. Poor Dory. No, this is fully expected. Perfect Dory's animations. And this is not expected. She was supposed to have a bigger radius. Oh, there we go. Alright. Oh, shit. I didn't look at the table broken. Okay, last one. After that, we got it. Hopefully. Okay, Dory has a run area. Should not be able to ledge grab that. And... We broke the table. And that looks really cool. I like this effect. Alright. So there's a quite big to-do list. The biggest thing is gonna be making all these collisions work. But after that, I think the level is done once again. Just breaking the tables is such a cool easter egg. Hello, Liliana. And goodbye. Because we're done streaming. I'll see you guys, I don't know when. Maybe I'll be able to stream more next week. But I'm not sure yet. There's a lot of stuff I wanna do. I wanna get some things done before we implement multiplayer. Just so that it's easier to implement. And I wanna get multiplayer implemented before we do the Worms Fortress HD demo. Just so people actually can play the multiplayer. But yeah, I'll see you guys next stream. Bye bye.
