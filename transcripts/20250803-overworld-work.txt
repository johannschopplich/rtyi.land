I wish we used to relax, like, like, like, like it as a family time, like, like, like, it as a family time, like it as a, like it as a, seems today, that all you see, is violence and movies, and sex on tv, the pereitos good old friends. Hello psychos. I wish we used to relax, like, like, like, like it as a family time, like, like, like it as a, like it as a family time, like, like it as a, like it as a, like it as a family time. Hello saltyn. Yeah, the horse is here. Howdy partner. Oh, I gotta collect money so I can actually buy the entry to the level. I don't know what that is. Not familiar with it at all. Did I not ever? Maybe it's because I updated my emulator version. Man, having the overworld mostly in the game feels good. It's like now I'm playing an actual game. You know what I mean? Whoa. What the hell? You don't see that. Oops. That's a bug. Is this live? Yes, this is live. Just kidding. It's from the future. Any OST wishes for today? Nintendo Summer Playlist, alright. No way. I can't open my overworld anymore? We need a new version of 64, I think. Yep. That is absolutely not great. I have like 30 different versions of Fast64 in my download folder. Yeah, this is the second level now that we cannot open anymore. What am I doing today? I haven't checked. This is very problematic. I think we should, before we write anything in here, we should disable Fast64, see if that works. Wait, F64 render wasn't even enabled. Whatever, we're gonna disable both of these. Open the overworld, try again. I think we had a conversation about this before, and someone told me how I can debug this. Even with Fast64 disabled, I can't do it. Yeah, if I can't open my level, how the fuck are we supposed to work? What's happening to the game crash? I am not sure. Apparently the crash bugs are in here. Oh, it all crashed up to XT. Yep. Oh god, my whole PC is fucking dying right now. Disjoint, what's happening? The tool that we use to create levels is just crashing right now, which is why we cannot open our level. Which is kind of blocking our workflow right now. Also, my CPU usage seems to be at 200%. What's going on? It should be at 35%. Fast64 is still using 30% somehow. Hmm. I don't know, Adriano. How do you even load a blend file like this? Is there an option even? Can we get this sorted out? Yeah, if we can't sort it out, we lose our entire overworld progress. Which would be pretty horrendous. Huh? I can post it. Hmm, maybe newest Fast64 is different. Create a new file, file a blend and select a scene. That might work. Let's try it after this attempt here. The crash not changed. Same. Hmm. Can't tell if it's working. This already is taking longer than opening a file that before, so maybe it is working. Hello, Xlinks. Welcome to me suffering because my tool isn't working. I know, Lasse. I also have a GitHub for it, but obviously if this keeps happening, like, what's the point? Because I wouldn't know which changes I lose. We might have to update Blenda. Is there, like, an update button in Blenda? Wait, that didn't append shit! Is there an update button in Blenda somewhere? This is 5.4, uh, 4.5. I wanted 4.2.13. What is this? Click download 4.2 and then download 4.5.1. What is this scam? He told me to download 4.2.13. It doesn't exist. What the hell is going on? Let me know what's about to happen. Use 4.5 fixed PR. I just want to open my level, Leela. I don't care how. This is the second level this is happening to, by the way. So this seems to be a thing that just randomly happens sometimes. I don't know what the trigger for is yet. I don't think I even added any new materials to the world last time I worked on it. So it's a little weird. I don't jpg. Please don't ask me questions like that. I want to work on the game. Why must I be tormented? The weather is not treating me well. It's too warm and I'm trying to open my level. But there is a bug in my tool that makes it so I can't open my level. It's the same construct. Cool. Please work. Please. I just want to work on my game. I hate computers. I hate computers. I hate computers. No! Same crash. Why did I get a crash for 4.2? Weird. What even are my options? Well, this might be a big, fat, do-nothing stream. What are we going to do? I guess we could try and blend up 1.5. I'm shitting up my entire SSD again. What's the problem? Blender crashes. We cannot open Blender. So we can't work on the level, because as soon as we try to work on the level, it just crashes. Append doesn't work. We tried. It doesn't append anything. It doesn't append anything. Right, I lose all my bookmarks. I forgot. I'm going to blend again. I always tend to do this. Where is my entire level geometry? Regarding the dome, I notice you still have oxygen in transition, doesn't it matter? No, I don't see it. Why would this be frustrating, over just having less oxygen? The intense feeling of, oh god, I'm going to die, please open up, please open up, please open up, is part of it. Okay, Lina posted a potential fix. Bro, what the fuck is going on? Can I just please get into my level? Why is it loading forever? How annoying. Let's try Lina's PR. Enter to unregister, that looks like the correct one. I don't know what's going on anymore. Oh, 4.5.1 loaded. At least I think it's no extensions. Any progress? I'm still trying to open the file with your Just Push PR. I downloaded your PR just now. It doesn't say anything there, I don't know if that's on purpose. Oh, you made a fix for it running without Fast64 enabled, so I should have disabled Fast64 before clicking on the file. So what I did just now was useless. Well, it opens up under 4.5.1. Let's try to disable Fast64 for a second. Disable Fast64 and Fast64 Render. We close this file, we open it. They're disabled. Let's see that. So I can't use 4.5 either. So what can't I do in 4.5? Can't upgrade old materials. So I can't work on really old files with it, I suppose. So it is a Fast64 thing. So it is a Fast64 thing. So it is a Fast64 thing. That was a frustrating way to lose 30 minutes. So it looks like when we enter a level, it doesn't actually reset the rotation of things. You blame Blender? I mean, it's clearly happening only with Fast64 enabled. It could be a stupid Blender API update or whatever. I don't feel sorry about it. Without Fast64, I would have to hack-saddle all my combiners. Imagine how awful that would be. Ah! The collision of this has always been weird. Okay, there we go. Let's see what's going on. I have this theory that your fix probably fixed it, and that the PR update just doesn't work. It did not? What's going on with the rotation of this thing? We need to figure that out first. Hello, Jakku. It's a crystal of cheese. Kind of up for your interpretation. There we go. That's weird that the collision was fucked like that. Anyway, let's get 30 coins and try to open that so we can finally start working. How do you like my new emulator? Eclab updated this a couple times for me so they can use it. It's called Lunas Project 64. I needed an updated emulator because F3DX3 just got updated and it has some cool new features that we want. Previous emulators were not compatible with it. We should add a save block to this area. Let's add a save block to this area. Oh wait, before we can do anything to this area, we have a big issue here. You can just long jump from here over here to skip the entire second bowser area, which is obviously a big issue. We don't want that happening, so we're going to have to do a little bit of form follows function here on this rock. Maybe something like that is a little better. How many times your mod can render after optimizations? At least 15. I don't know how many. What is this one little piece of green here? Do you see that? What is that? Oh, that's the wild axis. That's confusing. Where do we put the save block? Maybe here is a good place. I kind of like it. I have Sunshine, but this game is more like a proper sequel. True. Sunshine is very minimized. It's blatantly evident that the development budget for Sunshine just wasn't there. That's an issue in the graphic plugin. You need to enable Fragmented Depthright Lesser. But, this is a change Aglep made. He made it automatically so that if certain things are true, it is enabled by default. Oh, yes, that is fixed by the new emulator, but also you could have fixed that yourself beforehand. Oh, that's an issue. I like Sunshine, but it's not a bad game. There is no strict definition for what a bad game is. It's kind of like a silly argument, is it not? The wall doesn't look flat. I agree. It's not very flat, but it is flat. That's the VMap that makes it look like that. Something about this just doesn't sit right with me. This is going to be difficult to do because of the way the forest works. I think it'd be a lot easier to model this if we move the wall inwards. And just set this as wall hello to hello. What if instead the wall went like this? Eh, even that wouldn't work right now. Makes the forest so difficult to 3D model. What if we cut this off here? And just set this as all forest you can't access. That might be our best option. Would it? Maybe it would be better off without it. Alt-Click the changing forest then the position. And auto-fit it ever so slightly. And auto-fit it ever so slightly. And auto-fit it ever so slightly. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... shy guy. Oh he's very stylized. Wait how did you get the black outline? Oh that's a shader right? The black outline is a shader. Yeah he looks very fitting, very colorful. I like him. 328 triangles is quite a lot for these. Let me show you mine for comparison. Keep in mind like a base vanilla Mario 64 enemy is like 140. So that's usually what we're trying to go for. No shader. Oh did he duplicate the geometry and like write a black outline that way? In that case like you could probably just half the triangles and have it look normal right? You see another RSP bottlenecked? Hey Lina, so it's all cause memory transfers to render triangles. What are you talking about? I see so it is that strategy. Yeah I guess you can't see anything right now because I don't know why. Cool. Oh is it loading in? Something's happening. Yeah he looks very nice. I like him. I would like to show you mine but I can't because of this fast64 thing here. It's not being a nerd Lina, it's just very important information. Um actually you should not be killing people. What do you sound like? Oh my god, he said the same thing Lina. That's actually crazy. So okay. Lina, can you add a way to add a GeoASM before the first spawn of an armature? Because you can't do that right now. Is that what I'm explaining it for? That's not what I'm explaining, that's skinning. So you can't, it's impossible. I'm asking if you can do it. Wait, you can't, you can't do this anymore. That's tragic. That's actually a huge usability issue if you can't write a define in here. Object is not a full layer UV map. What did that change? Hasn't it always been like that? I don't think so. I've always been doing it the other way. So look at this, this is awful. Now I gotta move this here and I gotta change this to layer transparent. So right, we gotta make an animation for her. But now it's just going to be a static position. Programming is easy. It's all like, honestly you just get started and then everything else just becomes obvious as you go. Remember when Discover Rari went for art level design? Oh, I didn't even go to school for programming. I just started programming. So the download size is like, what is it? 53? It is 134, probably around half of that in radius for talking, plus the talk offset of 100. Then we're gonna get a ton of math equations. Most math equations used in programming are pretty obvious. If you want to do like more difficult stuff, then yeah, you'll probably have to learn a little bit of math. If you want to write a renderer, you'll have to learn linear algebra and stuff like that. 109, 70 for the shadow seems fine. We're gonna set it to a static dimension for now, and then we're almost ready to check it in game. So she is going to be in this corner here, all shy and stuff, and she only shows up after you're done with the mission with Boonarch. So, despawn, not spawn, so I mean, starts in rainbow.or, let's be 10, 5, 1. And then just for testing, we're gonna have our opacity cycle through all values. So math equations in programming, I actually kind of enjoy it. Interesting. Oh, the nav-enum is not in the game yet. We could program it maybe soon, but not right now. It takes me quite a while to catch up with the models you've made. Okay, her shadow is too opaque, so that's an issue. And there are some draw issues here. Okay. Also shouldn't be facing that way. Because is he a Shiner, Power Moon, Easter Egg? No. We're not referencing Mario games after Mario 64, or after the N64. Should Mario power-up? Never thought about it. And I like the blue shell power-up from the 2D Mario games. That's kind of cool. Hmm, to draw the... Actually, there's nothing we can do, now that I think about it. It's because the arms render after the face. Yeah, it just has to be like that. But maybe if she properly focuses you as you go, it's fine. Or wait, immediately invisible. What if we make her 1% opaque before you beat that? And then... Otherwise... At least like 10% opaque. The thing is, though, most of the time she will be very opaque and very transparent, so the render issue will not be as pronounced. You would only see it during a transition. Like right there, you can't really tell that the render order is kind of messy. I'm not sure I like the blue coin switch here anymore. I put it here so that there would be something to do even before Boonet is here or Boitris is here, but it's kind of detracting from Boitris. For programming, linear algebra is like the number one thing you should do. What if you just put a chain nothing here at first? I think that's a bad option. And then you just find the e-stack by yourself. You know what? A single blue coin. There's going to be a single blue coin here and that's our best option. RemuscoMaps, you know everything you really need. Yeah, unless you are doing more complicated stuff. There are no 3D coins. Did you think they were 3D? You get fooled. Not really. Okay, Leela, how are you going to program like a graphic thing without knowing quaternions or matrices for programming, huh? It doesn't work. You just need to understand the principle. What's that supposed to mean? You don't need to know math, you just need to understand it. Oh, we can't use opacity here, we have to use something else. Can you play on Unreal Hardware along with the recomp? Of course! Playing this on Unreal Hardware is like half the point. I mean, god, I hope it's playable on Unreal Hardware right now. Fail to start previewing, right. I hope OBS doesn't crash, let me show you. Hey! There's the game on Unreal Hardware. What's our framerate? Oh, the framerate, that takes a little bit to rile up. It's all running Unreal Hardware. There's bullet trees on Unreal N64. Seeing that? It all works. Well, the water has a few issues, but don't worry about it, it's just because it's such a big triangle. Don't put real in quotation marks, this is literally just an N64. This is just how it looks like. No tricks, that's just the N64, man. I thought you were trolling, I was not! That was just Unreal Hardware! It legit just looks like that. You might not know about summercats, an HDMI mod. Now look, I have the script here in my taskbar, I click it, and it uploads the ROM to my N64. Well, it didn't do it because I already had it uploaded. The SC64 deployer, that's what the summercat does. It even uploads a save file. It just looks amazing on N64. Alright, so the way we have it now is, if you've already talked to bullet trees before, she doesn't appear here, and then after you talk to her, she disappears forever. So what now should be happening is, we can talk to her, because we have, by default she's just an airbot, and then after we talk to her, she disappears, and we fight her, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. That's fine, I think. Wait, no, not this part. And we need to give her a text. So you can see our meta when you're close to her, she will fade in as soon as you talk to her. That's what you see right here, as soon as you're talking, she fades into full opacity. And then she disappears here, and appears in the rainbow grotto, where her husband lives. So now I need to give her a text. Let's find a text for her. I think we're on text box 501, actually. Yup, 501. Let's add 10 more entries. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Add voices. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Alright, she would say something like, um, she should call you a handsome young man, for like, saving her. You're small and not very floaty. True, she should be floating. Let's make her float real quick. Oh, barely sets her home. And, what's a good variable to use here? Not all anim states. Damage or coin value, fuck it. She might be amazed that she's able to meet the great Mario in her lifetime. Well, the idea is that her and her husband kinda lived in a cave forever, so they wouldn't really know about Mario. But she would call him a handsome young man for like, killing Bowser and getting rid of the Bowser statue. So that's what she would be talking about, and how she's gonna return to her husband. I don't know, this is not a final text. Usually, Biobank has much better ideas for texts than me. So, that scary monster's gone, the big dragon was staring me down for months. Or maybe just, let's try this. The big dragon was staring me down for months. You got rid of it? How would she speak? You got rid of it? What's an old way to say that? I don't know. How do old people talk? She's supposed to talk like she's from the 1800s or something. You recognize Bowser or Mario since they were released in the OG game? They definitely know Mario. Thank you, young man. Yeah, thank you, young man is good. I finally go home to my husband. The big metal dragon, just to make it clear what she's talking about. Hello, dear lady. Really? Is that it? Thank you, young lad. I like that. What's an old way to say home? My lodgings? My place? My retirement home? No. My domain? Oh, dear. Get rid of it, dear? To my boonard. Instead of husband. Let's try that. What is 501-256-245? No, it's not. 235. No, it's not 245. What am I talking about? And once we have animations for her, we can also import her to course three, where she will just have like a secret text. She's not going to give you anything. As if she gave you something that'd be way too obscure of a star or coin or whatever. Alright, she's floating. That's the completely wrong text. It works, though. I think I'm going to get rid of her shadow. Her shadow looks pretty bad. Might she have the wrong text? Oh, it's B-param 1, not 4. Dory made a dirty liar? I don't understand what you're talking about. Alright. I think her hovering animation was a bit too fast. She doesn't look very old when she's hovering like that. Dory is the dinosaur from HZSK. It's staring me down for months. Get rid of it, dear. Thank you, young lad. Finally go home to my moon art. Alright. And then after this, she appears in the rainbow grotto. Seems good. Alright. Wrinkly Kong? The RTYI Iceberg. There will be an RTYI Iceberg, I can tell. And I'm not going to answer to any of it. Maybe this game is creepy and has an evil aura. Who knows? She went to hell, yes. I don't think there's a way to skip over here anymore. I think I firmly got rid of that. Unless... Come on. Doesn't work. Okay, no. Not even close. Yeah, I think we successfully patched the skip. Alright. So, the next thing for this area here is this robot here. The robot needs to be destroyed after we reach the first Bowser level. Where is the 8 in this? It's supposed to say 18 on this. What the fuck? What is going on? That's scary. It's back. What? I'm not gonna fix this before Biomek's update. There would be no point in it. But I might have to put this in a playable state. Actually, I guess it is in a playable state. What the fuck? Biomek is doing a rework of every level. He's currently doing the Ice Cap level. What? Oh no, right now he's working on the Ice Cap. Don't use chain subpanics, right. That's the issue here. What do we do with the Mech Bowser? I think we just kinda make it dead and smoke coming out of it. 30 on game. Now I know what the fuck is, don't worry. That's just a music comment I removed. That's still being used there for some reason. What? So after the Bowser level, what happens is... Which is kinda... What? Oh, there we go. What if we just have him like this? And with smoke coming out? Golden Freddy post? I have never played FNAF, so... I'm innocent. What if at the same time we had a little animation of him trying to get back to normal? But he keeps failing at it. Why the fuck is it not working? Make cycling is not working, cool. Something like this, I think, would look good. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know the 64 code. I don't know the IDO code, by the way. I don't know. We can add a bit of delay. I don't know. Anyway, let me first import this, and then we can min-max stuff like that. Actually, let me write a video for this. Video. Actually, I shouldn't do this right now. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That is the star, right? Yep. No. Maybe. Nope, it's not. That's one. Zero, actually. Hello, Dara. I'm glad you like it. I don't know. I really should be renaming this function more like it. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Alright, let's see if that works. This game doesn't have more base areas than base game. That's why you can just use the whole... Well... It has a lot more areas. But the level IDs I use are basically the same. We might have to add some. But we'll see. Okay. Okay, a small issue. I don't know why that happens. I don't know why that happens. That's a little weird, actually. Oh. Guess we didn't call the function. Well, that would certainly do it. Hello, Luna Festival. That's kind of fun. I like how broken he looks. Now we just need smoke coming out of his neck here. And then it's perfect. Okay. I wish I knew how to set a bot in the new Blender. It's really annoying. Lila, do you know? You are the biggest Blender expert. You would know this, right? How do you set the dot in Blender? The 3D cursor? Do you know? I don't know. You can do that to anything. How you used to do it before 4.2? Before 4.2, you used to just click on nothing and it would set the cursor there. Okay, good start. Okay. Manual? What's the manual say? Okay. Who will be pinging me? Okay, bro really is smoking it up. Holy shit. I promise, he's spawning so many particles that Mario just walking despawns them. Because there are not enough particles around. So, we do not like that. Actually, I think the smoke should just go up faster. I think that would help a lot. Can you show me the triangle you have? I tried, but it just didn't work because 64 was not active. I kinda love this. This is very funny looking. Tenor.com Five nights at Freddy's Golden Freddy. I guess I'm 12. Kindergarten has fallen. Can you add sparkle effects in it? I love impounding on it. This should save the game too. You know what, I'm doing that right now. I'm making that save the game. It would feel satisfying to ground pound it. iversityofria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universityofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com UNC universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitysofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitysofaria.com universitysofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitysofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com universitiesofaria.com make there be a golden vigenette at the screen edges when the safe goes through okay, next there is a dory chained to a wall in the lake after beating the first bowser, yoshi is on dory's back when you talk to him, he says it three times with his mighty behind you can write a story to get up graham, are you still here? did you want to try and make dory? if so, i'm gonna hold off on doing this i can import your dory otherwise if you say yes, then we will move on to the next area here which is part three the beach side i guess no response i guess he's gone in that case, well i have to import this story here which is not a bad dory make it say bimplecrimple too realistic she looks pretty nice 212 triangles so she has to be chained somewhere where it's like you can't warp on her to instantly skip the area but i guess you can i guess here would be a good place then you could use her to platform around wouldn't be so bad here's actual skeletal mesh support no, we use like a fake thing to fake skeletal meshes which is why it looks like this but it's not really skeletal mesh it's just like a hack you see how it like bends the triangles? that's what happens in game shut up, it is skeletal mesh ok, it is skeletal mesh me when i'm at the club doon, doon, doon, doon, doon, doon, doon me when i'm at the lila rave at 3am doon, doon, doon, doon, doon yeah, lila is sleeping tonight boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom sorry i had a little moment there i have not gotten to the point where i can continue but i do try ok, here we go doon, doon, doon, doon, doon doon, doon, doon, doon doon, doon, doon doon, doon, doon, doon doon, doon, doon, doon doon, doon, doon, doon doon, doon, doon, doon doon, doon doon, doon, doon doon, doon doon, doon, doon doon dooon doon the chance it's gonna happen again tonight, good, deserved for speaking back to me do you not have any respect for your elders? you can tell i'm becoming a parent this is the type of shit parents say god i hate when parents do that someone should take away their children no that's too much actually someone should do the same thing to them we gotta add chains to her too, somehow oh, that's the area we don't want that that's the parents life janitor that's the parents life janitor are you a parent? do you not have a cat? my child just turned one like a week ago you're a parent of your cat? yeah that counts that just counts you're a baller bitch do you have any chance to become fast64? no guarantees dory actually fits here well i just forgot to animate her hydration check hydration check we will hydrate your son is 3 and you're 22? dang dad's young to be a parent dory is drowning? true do you think dory has lungs? or do you think she has... gills i mean, think about it she has the body shape of like how do you call it quad fin quad fin animal tetrapod? no not tetrapods the other thing coelacanth she looks like she evolved from coelacanth i mean you say mammalian for sure maybe she's mammalian do they have back legs? no in all mammalians the back legs fused into a back fin right think about it which real world animal is she actually close to i'm saying it's coelacanth maybe maybe oh they have 6 nevermind i'm completely wrong but she doesn't really look like a seal either because they're missing the back legs oh i don't know does that mean she has to have gills? does that mean she has to have gills? does that mean she has to have gills? does that mean she has to have gills? plesiosaur actually yes she is literally just based off a plesiosaurus which means no gills yes right how could i forget that she's based off a plesiosaurus her name is luigi plessy right so she will be kind of chained like this but then after you beat the first bowser she's going to be free and you can go on her back over to the second overworld that's how you unlock the second overworld now to chain her down what's a humorous way to chain her down is that dinosaur a mammal think about it anchor? just like an anchor with a chain around her? i think that would work well and then after you free her the anchor is just on the floor that works but i think anchor is far more humorous wow what happened to her eyes i swear yep i know what it is oh that's going to be so fucking annoying now it's because of the environment color here because that's part of all the default combiners but you should never actually have it in a combiner because it causes the issue i just showed that also explains what happened here yeah definitely like an anchor with a bowser symbol oh bro i have been  as first one pair until now oh so i'm we can ro okay what do you when will you do do okay ooh me in a market combination if you have beaten the first level no reason to keep this around all right okay there needs to be something else here we're gonna do that we're gonna crash all right I think I'm feeling pretty done for today. We made good progress we got Boatrice in we got the thing in despite the 30 minute setback at the start of the stream managed to open this level again which is awesome the next step will be programming Dory and putting a Yoshi on her back after you have the first Bowser star and then maybe we have to fix the Bowser level so that we can actually do the Bowser fight and get the Yoshis in the overworld to appear anyway I will see you guys in the next stream whenever that may be bye bye
