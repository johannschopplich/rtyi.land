You You You Hello James hello Parker Chris And links I Don't go I Mean are you actually buzzing? That's interesting. Hello, Sarah I Have no idea what you're talking about I Interesting so you also German that moved to Canada or are you just someone in Canada with German parents? This is for the sub area in course 14 So It's gonna be the inside of the pyramid What you're seeing here is not representative of what the stage will be like at all I Doesn't have a name yet Handmade heights was a suggestion and I Forgot what the other solution was, but it was also good 1.6 is not a virus, but you can make viruses and played up in project 64 1.6 I Got a lot of stuff done off stream It's a sub area in course 15 I Have to finish this area here This is definitely the hardest star in the game so far Let's try that again I Mean it's still easy enough that if I don't like fuck around I can easily beat it But I feel like some of you guys might have trouble with this level I Actually kind of lost there never mind, I guess even I can buy on the stage that's how difficult is this I Think I got peaks. Yeah, something like that I Can make this a bit easier by just climbing on above here if you want I Just asked em, it's you know, they will just actually maybe they will damage you. I'm not sure yet. Just again and you'll be fine This is definitely a stage where you need to log in You  Can't be worse than Diana dogs. I'm sure this is a little harder than I had. I had dogs Crafty Kenyans. Yeah, I got names No, I agree a little bit of difficulty is fun, which is why I made the level That's hard as it is Now couldn't mission though is to work on The inside of the pyramid so you can go in here and there's gonna be an inside of a permit with eight red coins And I do want this to feel like a contrived Have system almost but not like a labyrinth So that's hard to do I The confusion needs to resolve that's a difficult part here So for that I'm thinking we need like specific landmarks and we need other pieces of the maze like struck visible Melody time I Like these three stories I Turn the next area. Yep. There's only two areas missing in the papercraft level and then Chris 14 is complete Trying thoughts No, I wasn't thinking of putting life things in here. There's got to be enemies still like One should probably write this down It's in there's no sun and doors I Try to imagine this level in my head So, I know I want two coins to face each other above active I want two coins to be on parallel paths to each other can also be anywhere and I know I want at least three stories It's very limiting. I know I want some one ways in there So you can't just to the follow left wall strategy because it ruins every maze instantly This is the galvanized square steel and eco-friendly wood veneer theme song I Maybe one can be like on a cliff that comes off. There could be a large Empty cliff in the middle and pass go around in a large Empty cliff in the middle and pass go around That would be kind of cool Won't give you something to orient yourself on very well This seems to be about the right size too I Gotta think of more solutions to make this more resolving What really resolves a case system? I guess as soon as you understand the underlying structure of it. I Never in formatted my windows install So, yes, it is still the same from 2019 sounds right maybe 2018 Because one is fully finished and the demo is ready I just need to actually like make the demo ready I Can you tell it's the same windows install that's interesting It's true Chris 15 will be the war level and the release will be tomorrow And all these questions that are being about 15 times the stream the answer is exactly what you want to hear It's very specific that's interesting What if there was an underlying pattern to the cave system one that is easy to resolve once you understand it That instantly tells you how this level looks can we think of hello bio back Currently collecting ideas for the permit level I'm thinking this should kind of feel like an intricate cave system and it should feel kind of maze like but I want there to be like a Moment of the player getting it on the blade of like, ah, this is how it works. And from then on it's not a maze anymore That's what I want So this is inside up here Actually, I should probably also show you the other sub area I finished off stream Just so you're up to date with the newest state of our tyi. I Finished a saw area It is by far the most difficult area in the game and when Zaina played and she had trouble beating it But I think the difficulty is fine considering its course 15 So This part works intended I love that part The camera has to be on the other way. So these thoughts they have a timer the timer starts going as soon as you enter a certain range from them and Then they go so you basically always have to move But the slower you move to slower the sauce are so there's a bit of rubber bending here basically I Also color-coded the individual pieces I think that that's a lot to the stage here This is the one place without a harsh time limit Yeah, that's what works which was 15 now, this is course 14 the act select is just wrong Something's up with the opacity there. This is not how the walking is supposed to be. Is it like that everywhere? Oh That's weird, I Think it's really really cool to just worry that it's too difficult Oh that mode is very difficult to work with that is the solution interesting but that makes sense i did kind of programming like that oh well it's fine to yeah i mean i had Zeina trying to play it and she didn't really have a shot at beating it so that's why i feel like it's a little difficult um either way make it feel like a maze but make the confusion resolve so one way the confusion can resolve is if you could see the majority of the maze at some point the large empty cliff in the middle where you see all the paths from that kind of does it that that helps a lot so you see that and now you kind of know where everything is yeah i agree by the way it's still something i'm worried about the number of course one will have a debug hub world basically but not much is going on um can we maybe color code the paths in a way that slowly resolves the mystery um it's not chinese tiktok music this is a little john galvanized square steel and eco-friendly wood veneer theme song so what kind of paths are going to be there's going to be paths to red coins there's going to be paths to the main area and there's going to be paths to other paths we could color code it in a way that if a box is red or reddish then it moves to a red coin if a room is greenish it moves to the middle and if uh if it's true then it moves like a random direction that would work um basically the inspiration for how i want this to play like is no not that it's like this but And a more cave-like. Does that make sense? This is another roaming I made. So you can't accuse me of stealing, because I would be stealing from myself. Kinokyo made this level so pretty. More of a puzzle zone. I guess it kinda is like a puzzle, but I don't want this to be like a brain-tracking logical puzzle. I want this to be more like confusion and then the confusion resolves, because you understand it. Which does sound a lot like a puzzle. The difference is that there's no active effort required from the player. Rather, you just do the thing, and without really thinking about it, you suddenly understand it. And the paths need to be made interesting somehow. So there's gonna be lots of staircases and stuff like that. I'm not seeing what you're saying. Have you changed the jump dive? Did you get a lag from it? What's the reason you want to change it? I did not change it. You are not seeing right. You might be mistaking it for the ground pump dive. Where you do gain a little bit of height. But this isn't a completely optional move that you have to opt in. And this move is never required to beat the game. So rather than the toggle, you have the option to just not use it, if you want to not do that. It's entirely a move made to make your life easier and to make the movement a little bit fluent. Similarly, you have this move here. Where you notice a kiss down B from Super Smash Bros. Can you actually BLJ here? What the fuck? What? That's a new bug? Apparently you cannot BLJ. Oh my god. Interesting. That's a very important bug to fix. I don't know what the issue is. I just need to figure out where the issue is. I don't know what the issue is. I just need to figure out where the issue is. Oh, C value. Yeah, that's good. No, I would never try to make it like Mario 64 DS. Mario 64 DS is ass. What other ways of resolving the confusion do I have? There could be a logical pattern to the game's structure. Something like... It's spelling a name. What about the rooms with the ladder above them? And you need to enter the rooms in order to make a password in this community to play at some point? Oh, this is a red coin area. And no, that's too much puzzle. I think a puzzle like that is very much against the rest of the design of RTY. That's why even in the level based on puzzles, course 2, all the puzzles are not really puzzles. The puzzle is like realizing that there is a puzzle. And what I want here is the confusion to resolve. As in, this is an intricate cave system. And you're like, oh my God, this is such a weird cave system. So I don't know where I am or where anything is. And then as you go through it, you realize, oh, this is how this works. It could be something like... Half the pyramid is an upside down version of the other half of the pyramid. But that's like... Too hard to imagine and also very difficult to work with. There's a little red that connects all the rooms from the start to the end. But it goes back to rooms already explored in Crescent World South. So you don't follow it from the start. You don't know where to go. It's kind of similar to the follow the left wall strategy when you are due to a maze, right? And I kind of want to prevent that. I don't want it to feel like you're just guided along something. I still want the player to feel they're free to go anywhere they want. That's why I'm going to have some one ways in here. So that you can't just follow the left wall. So you are forced to engage in your freedom. And forced to understand what the puzzle looks like or the pyramid looks like. And you can't just follow the left wall. Basically. So that's kind of the opposite of what I want. But color coding certain parts in a Yama puzzle? What is that? Oh, what the hell? I don't understand this. This is like you're supposed to undo them. So this is like geometry and stuff. What other way is there to... Do I have a single example of something where confusion resolves in a cave system? It can be entirely through a mirror. Meaning you have to navigate with no controls but your view is through a mirror. That just sounds awful to be honest. But no, that's absolutely not what I want. I think the design goal I set out is very clear here. We wanted confusing at first and then we wanted to resolve into making sense. And I want the confusion from being overwhelmed with all the directions you can go. You ever been in a labyrinth? You'll be like, I can't tell shit apart from fuck. I'm just like, fuck it, I'll go around the direction. That's how I want the player to land here. But then through being in here, I want the player to realize what's going on. And then be able to competently navigate the maze. And I know that might be a lot to ask. But we can do quite a few things to maximize on this mirror. So the best one I have so far that I wrote down is a large empty cliff. So you go through random paths and then there's one room where you come out and you come out of one entrance. And then you see four or five other entrances below you. And you'll be like, oh, that's where that is. I've been there before. Or you can even jump down there. Do I know what's going on? You have to decide what's going on. Exactly. I want to think of a mechanic that is going on to make this happen. Landmarks a good thing, I feel? Yes, yes, landmarks will definitely help. But ideally, that'd be like a grand idea at play. So the color-coded paths idea I had before, I think kind of works. As in, the more reddish paths lead to red coin pieces. And... Or otherwise dead ends. Although they'd have to be directional somehow, so... We need walls that are also directional. I think you want the player to find out what the area looks like. I think that kind of sucks. Maybe if we had a thing where the player would be able to figure out which paths are worth navigating rather than finding out what the entire area looks like, that is just as valuable. Right, so the color-coded idea would work for that. But... There's a single mission that's a red coin mission, so there isn't a path to find. Yeah, you kind of have to explore the whole area here. Hmm... Maybe the idea does just kind of suck. Because I can't think of a good way to make it work. But I also don't want it to just kind of be a copy of the Course 12 Goomba Bandit area, where it's like... I don't know, a red coin area.    Platforming over the void. Can we set up like a clock, but it will only look like a clock from the highest point. Central circle room connects them. Hmm... Hmm... It could be interesting with like an octagon in the middle maybe. And then the eight paths branch out and each leads to a red coin, but also to the other paths. So if you're ever confused, you can just go back to the middle. Hmm... Maybe a single mission with a switch room would work great, but a red coin mission... It's just going to be running around anyway. Yeah... Hmm... Blood paths slowly being filled in. I understand. Oh, you mean like every path you did walk along yet has like a different color, and as soon as you step foot into that room, it gets colored? That is an interesting idea. So that way you would know where you've been and where you haven't. I can kind of see that working. Although making that would be absolute torture. Hmm... I'm not sure if I like the clock idea, though, to be honest. It feels like a lot of backtracking would be involved if we made it that way. And it would also misalign them from the world axis, which is going to be a pain in the ass to work with. Code of Cards is at a level and Mario leaves footsteps so he knows where you spin. Damn... It's possible to program, but like... Ugh... You know what I mean? Ugh... That would probably also lead to a crit at some point, or like footsteps would have to be eradicated eventually. I'm assuming the level is really small. Or we'd have to put a virtual texture decal over the entire level. Oh god... Ugh... Yeah, it would be cool, but the technical limitations are existent. Why am I even fixing that? We're not gonna go with any kind of this layout. This layout sucks. What if there's one main path, but along this main path many mini-paths branch out and they're like shortcuts into other pieces of the main path? And the red coins are hidden on those paths? I don't know.      Oh god... A ground pound to make a pile splatter or something. Ideally it wouldn't... everything looks similar enough to where you would actually need that, you know. But the idea of one main path with a bunch of small paths along it that connect back to the main path, I think that works. If you've already been, that's exactly the thing you've been looking for. On one hand yes, on the other hand there's gonna be the issue that there is gonna be like a small part of the maze where you haven't been to yet and you don't know how to find that. But think about this, if it is one main path with a bunch of smaller paths leading to other places of the main path, you're gonna walk along the main path, you're gonna find a sidetrack, you're gonna go along the sidetrack and then you walk backwards to where the main path is and walk along the next shortcut. That way, if you're lost, you can just go back to the beginning of the main path and go to new first sidetracks where you haven't been to. And you might not immediately realize that it's really just one long path with a bunch of sidetracks along it, but once you do, you will be able to just do the red coin mission like that. And this works because there's one entrance and one exit to the pyramid. It's a red coin mission maker. Shortcut paths and a one-way door. Honestly, I kinda like that. Hyrule Glitch Pyramid? Let me look for that. Kinda makes me sad that all the 3D platformers look good. And maybe I feel bad for this, but this looks good, but I have no desire to play this. Does that make sense? I don't understand why I don't have the desire to play it. What gives you the desire to play something? I recently really wanted to play party house in UFO 50 that's an interesting that I need to analyze but not relevant to what we're doing right now I did have going for a normal platforming level reaching the end seeing the red coins somewhere going what the fuck they were red coins yeah I sure what was really good I mean it looks really polished I guess we're looking at this for like other ideas for the Egypt level the colors are really cool too what console is this game for this looks like it's for like ps5 or something oh it is ps5 I guess this famous and famous cuz like no one has a ps5 this game feels like it should be famous which game is this my mic did Sony bribe people to make this game for the ps5 like surely they they wouldn't like put so much money into a console no one this one oh yeah it looks great I don't want to play out and I don't know why the only franchise mentioned for protagonist and host okay now it's sold 62 million units what I thought no one could get the hand on the ps5 well how much is the ps5 $580 440 I'll stay 250 oh it's the pro model no one wanted see I haven't owned a PlayStation since the PlayStation hmm let me think about this how do I want this to look this one's an event in sentiment windows yeah I guess there's much reason to have a PlayStation games just hit PC eventually anyway right I guess Nintendo games had PC too but illegally I want to make sure that the sizes you feel correct first before we move on I think now that we have plan for the level done we are we can switch the song you guys excited for a new song this is my stream and I get to pick the movie the ceilings a little high okay this size left right feels awesome I still we need eight shortcuts along this path in total and I want the shortcuts to appear like early so I'm thinking the first shortcut should be like from here down to here like so it's just the one way slide down here with a red coin in it but then if you go that way you're gonna miss the second shortcut which will be here and bleed even further down the road there's no lava level you must be confused what I like about this is that when this way the optimal flavor of this is gonna be not along the main path here but it's gonna be going here getting the red coin going up the main path going back here so whenever you get a red coin you have to follow the path backwards again which I think is a it's gonna make the platforming fun it's just gonna be fun if it's not too long I'm sure that's not an issue we'll have to see I think I want this to be skinny it's just part of the lava level what are some of the most repetitive NPC lines and video games wasn't there something in Bubsy3D where he just said something about the pilot Pokemon Center oh but it has to be spoken dialogue right otherwise it doesn't count hello maury luigism 64 Dodgers or Yankees is this American football rugby isn't is an American football rugby what's the difference between rugby and American football so you go down here go up here go down here then you come out here oh that's not good there needs to be another shortcut before that this doesn't work my plan the forks for cake-based fields are enormous and you guys are ready for a certified case hot take oh my god this one's not gonna go over well you guys remember when ninja said how are you ever missing the cake I would simply hire a guy that always gets the cake I agree with him that cake you should never miss that it's dark because I'm in the basement not because it's a white field but because like that's your job your job is hitting that thing surely I mean the thing doesn't move right the conditions are basically the same you should be able to do them with your eyes closed no am I am I wrong here I mean just think it's just thinking strategically like the best strategy would be to always hit the thing right there's no counter play to it I'm just saying man if you don't miss that you win so why are you missing I realize there's a flaw in my logic here but like if I had to play it I would simply just you know like I think that's the right strategy for my team I'm so cool well the thing about that though Biobak is that the other team's trying to stop you who's trying to stop you when you're just you know kicking at the goal with a free kick you know what I mean like they can't there's nothing they can do similarly when you play basketball why don't you just train the team of people that can make a shot from anywhere why are you learning dribbling and everything why don't you just get like how many people in basketball like four guys why didn't you just get four guys that can just shoot across the entire court and instantly win there's no one thought of this before I'm Stephen Curry dude Zayn has a friend that has a name like that and it's Like tommy tomato and it's like that's not a real person and she says yes tommy tomato is real i think no tommy tomato is not real he would have a real name if he was real i know i know tommy tomato he's real have you heard about the rizla i've heard about the costco kit the one that goes like that's two booms and i think he's called the rizla as well is that him and you can use the entire meta with your just record players that don't miss strategy i think so too the rizla hangs out with the costco guys oh the rizla is the small fat one okay yeah i thought he was the fat kids is he also baby grung or is that a different one so germans definitely make stupid famous people you have ever heard of oliver pocher he is what you were so let me check inside okay hello sile so do so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so  so so so so so so so Are you going to be able to tell which way is the shortcut and which way is forward and which way is backward? We might have to do something like arrows on the floor or if there's ant enemies we can have the ants walk a certain way so that you implicitly know what's forward from there or we could have coin arrows. I still need to place coins in the main area actually. I'm going to see how much performance I have left here. They can't always be walking the same way. They can stand in place until the approach is close enough and then once they're in field they just start walking basically. Looks like I forgot to set the random mode. That kind of looks like it's made out of glass. Oh my god it's reality destroying. Do you see this? The reality walking toilet paper. I want to get a better look at it. This is definitely from a render mode not being set correctly. Turns everything into wireframe somehow. The wireframe must be from alpha x opacity and no alpha x coverage. Oh now it's normal. Never mind. And then it probably like adds the frame buffer color to the frame buffer color or something in the blender and that's what's happening. You're asking if it's necessary to have 60 megabytes of RAM if the console has 8 megabytes of RAM. Clearly it's not necessary otherwise the console wouldn't work. Wouldn't even turn on. I'm thinking there should be like switches that open a trapdoor as well and then maybe like right here you can fall through the trapdoor for a shortcut. So the shot can sync downwards. I don't know nearly enough about Madro's Mask to answer the question. Speaking of which I need to talk about how great Madro's Mask is. I never appreciated this before but we are recently playing Twilight Princess me and now do two minutes of story and here's another dungeon and stuff like that. And to me that's not really what I really like about Zelda that much. What I really like about Zelda is all the in-between. And then I was thinking back to Ocarina of Time and Ocarina of Time doesn't have much of the in-between either. It's also just like dungeon dungeon dungeon. But Madro's Mask. I think Madro's Mask formula is perfect. And I think Madro's Mask being like that is what made Missing Link like that as well. Because Madro's Mask is what I like a lot. It's not necessarily the side quests is it's all the world building and stuff that's in-between there. No I never 100% Ocarina of Time. Side quests are the main quest really yeah yeah that's a good way of putting it. What I also like about Madro's Mask is you never know if what you're doing right now is really useful to the story or not. Which I just like that way more. I don't like how in Twilight Princess it's like either I do the story or I feel like I'm utilizing my time inefficiently because I could just come back later with more items that then would be able to gather more. Missing Link, choose your plan to make. So for me there's three major issues in Missing Link. Or three things that were done to Missing Link that I just kind of disagreed with. The first was well obviously the crash when you open Zarya's door that sucks. The second is in the dungeon there is the hexagonal main room and then there's the elevator in the hexagonal shape and then the room below the elevator that you have to go into with this hourglass doesn't have a hexagonal shape. So that made it really difficult to deduce that you have to go through the elevator because you can't deduce that from the map. So as an additional hint on how to solve the puzzle I wanted the room below that to be hexagonal so that change has been made. And during the boss there's thorns on the outside which made the boss more difficult than it already was. And a lot of people were saying the boss is difficult, a lot of people were saying the boss is easy. It's kind of a shitty situation. But removing the thorns I think is universally just a good change because it makes the fight easier for bad players and doesn't affect it for good players. Yeah, that's true. Two, three, four, five. Three more. I'm just making platforms up. Maybe I need more ideas for this level. Oh wait! I'm not sure if I want ants actually. Now that I think about it we wanted bombs and womps here. Ants is kind of not really fitting in that concept, right? I just realized there's a little bit of a clash there. It's a little bit mace-like. Well it's not a whole level, it's a sub-area. And I hope it won't suck. Yep, it's all a lot of cardboard. The idea is that there's shortcuts you can take. Well basically the idea is we want this to feel confusing at first but then after you understand the concept it's no longer confusing. Basically there's shortcuts you can take here and the shortcuts have the red coins. But then you kind of go backwards right before the shortcut that you took was and from there you take the next shortcut. So basically everything you only walk once but you have the option to do it wrong. And you are likely to do it wrong at first. And then I want the player to understand that and do it right. And then once you're doing it right you can take the shortcuts to get faster. It sounds kind of good at first but I still have to make it work somehow. Hello, I'm your cat. We probably have to color-code the shortcuts somehow. Which, you know, is no issue at all. We can just have like a red ring around. Actually we don't have to color-code. Ah yeah, maybe we do. Oh well. Anything rewarding on the wrong path? Even if you go along the wrong path you still make progress towards the goal. Right, let's say you come in here and you see the red coin here but instead you go this way along. Then you still eventually like reach the end of the shortcut here but now you're here and I guess you have to walk backwards. I guess the wrong path is not taking the shortcut but you're supposed to walk backwards. I don't think it really matters. There we go. Hmm. Let's see, make this look like an abyss first and then it's actually a shortcut or something. Makes it too obvious it's a shortcut, I don't like that. Maybe this way? Hmm, that seems to be one way, otherwise it doesn't work. Hmm. Hmm. No, big whole game things like that can only be decided at the end. Deciding it before that is inefficient, so I won't. Probably not really a one way. I guess you can likely just jump up here, but it would be a big awkward jump, so this should work. One, two, three, four, five, six. Six red coins, two more. Then we got them all. So the next shortcut needs to be coming from here or something. And actually we can put the exit on any side we want. I don't remember, there was some sort of Karate Dumbbell in RTP, I said 206, something like a small stage. There was initially a dojo in the game to teach you the new moves, but we kind of just moved that to Course 1. And I'm no longer 100% certain that we want the dojo. You know what, so I don't go insane, let's take a small detour and start putting coins in this piece of the level, this part of the level. Here? You are. I was just gonna say, the twitter post yesterday, I think the reason it didn't get a ton of views is because of the time when you posted it. Posting times are pretty stupid, but if you don't post at a certain time of the day, then no one sees it. It's like that on youtube, it's like that on twitch, and it's like that on twitter I'm guessing too. So that's probably why it only got a few. Okay, you also got that, that's good. Yeah, I think we should prefer just scheduling our posts for the next day, because nothing we do is time sensitive. I'm guessing twitter assumes that tweets are time sensitive and news, but our posts really are not news. We could have posted this in 1997 and it would have been more relevant than it is today. So, racist caricature Yoshi, I think I prefer not getting cancelled, I already almost get cancelled over the nippers in course 3. It's been more like, nipper? That's a racial slur, that's not a mario enemy. I'm thinking, yep, that is a mario enemy. Please do not murder me, I didn't do anything. There's a galaxy enemy called the digger, oh. Digger is a very well used german word. I do wonder how that word came about though, anyone know the etymology of that word? Someone add that guy that does those etymology rambles and tell him to tell us where digger comes from. I don't think it's the n-word, it wouldn't be a popular word if it was. What if they hide a little row of coins here as a christmas present? You know what, I think blue coins would do great here. Connecting blues on the jumping platform has to be fun, because in the pool it doesn't feel empty. I might still fill the pool with water, or the oasis rather, which I know is not realistic, but it's actually coated cardboard. It repels the water. It still feels a little bit empty, doesn't it? I really wanted to repolish the hack. Like 2024? End of 2024? That's like the original timeline. And I mean I had some time to hit that target, but then we decided to polish it. This is where I'm going to get them. Even with a global coin counter you think people are going to get them? You won't even be able to see how many coins you have in the current level. Unless we did like a Sonic Adventure thing where it counts your coins down and gets them to the global counter or something. I don't want 100 coins to be part of 100% though. The original demo only took like 3 or 4 months. And it had 4 finished levels. I'm going to get 1 coins in level 1 before I even have a chance of seeing that it's global. Not necessarily. We could put coins in the overworld that guarantee that you see that the coins carry into the level. You would start the level with a bunch of coins already in your inventory. Or we could make you buy a boat ticket at the beginning. Where you have to collect 10 coins or something. That's too much of a 4th wall break. I don't like that. Someone might accidentally stumble upon that too without even intending to go for 100 coins. No, we are not just telling the player. If it's like a beginning island, maybe a little town with a blue coin switch or something. You collect 30 coins very easily and buy a boat ticket. And then you arrive at the island with 20 coins still in your inventory. You're going to know those are global coins. Or at least you're going to be very suspicious that it is. I can note that down in my overworld notes. Alright. Alright. Alright. Or. Or. Wait. Give me a second. What if I do this? What if the coin count is just always four digits? So that it says 0100 coins. So you know that you expect to get more than 999 coins. I think that could work. That doesn't look very good. I mean. Let's actually see this. Okay. Yeah, I can kind of see how it doesn't look that good. But it doesn't look that different from just saying 462. Hmm. Yeah, basically, Judy. Yeah. That's the idea. Hmm. How did this look? Hmm. It is pretty close to the right side of the screen. But no, in my opinion, just starting the level with some amount of coins is going to be enough to know that there's no 100 coins there. You probably didn't think there was a 100 coins on the Bowser levels either, right? You may have thought there was a 100 coins in the side levels. I know I definitely tried to get the 100 coins in the secret slide. Got enough coins in the Bowser level? You can get infinite coins during the Bowser fight. You can definitely get 100 coins in there. That's how I know. Hello, Aggie. This is a box out of a pyramid made out of cardboard. And now that goes on rework. The fun never ends. Now, how can I make this section interesting? Oops. I can show you real quick what the level looks like, Aggie. Am I having funny fall animations? Mario doesn't have any funny fall animations, to my knowledge. This is what course 14 is. It's a level made out of cardboard and paper and other craft materials. These guys here are thimbles. And this is the snow you made in first grade. And that's Luigi. He's also cardboard. And a paper spring. Yeah, having to make it all out of paper is very limiting. Oops. I never checked this blue coin switch before. Okay, yeah, easily. And he's an egg, a painted egg. Oh, I guess he can do that. Makes sense that he can do that. My favorite part is this thing here. Oh, what the hell was that with the coins? That's not good. Yeah, there will be another demo of just Course 1. You played Madness on release? Oh, that's crazy. Oh, we could have a little part inside the pyramid. Or a part with spikes coming out of stuff. And then you have to walk across the spikes. Well, to beat Madness, you have to be Madness. Something has to be wrong with you if you beat Madness. There's no sand birds in Madness. Do you mean Bird is the Word? There's a level called Bird is the Word. I'm going to assume you mean Bird is the Word. Well, if you want a level remade, you can pay me to do it. But depending on how much you pay, the quality will be varying. Don't you love Bird is the Word? How can you say this fucking level? It's peak. Crazy that you actually spent 30 minutes on it. I don't know what Super Blocks are, Eggie. But if it's something I programmed into Star Revenge, then the answer is probably yes. Because I'm pretty sure everything in Star Revenge I programmed as a global object. So Brodude could just use it. I did make the badges for one of the Star Revenge, but I don't know which one. All the Star Revenge just kind of blur into one for me. I'm thinking this will be a staircase with two doors that you can only open from one side. Oh, right, that makes sense. This also makes sense. You got hit with six adds in a row? Oh my God. Dude, Twitch sucks. You poor. Dude, if the Twitter analytics, if this stays this way, look at this. We got 1.4 million impressions. That's like, I think that's like $160 or something. In seven days, that's like $600 a month. If Twitter impressions worked like that, that'd be crazy. You can have all that. Even if it's only a fifth of that, I mean, it's not nothing. I think I'm going to change this up a little bit. I have to speed the other way around. So. We do better than OnlyFans. I'm not sure how many people want to see Biobak naked. So I don't, I can't speak to whether OnlyFans would be a better source of income or not. I can fairly confidently say, though, that I probably wouldn't want to see him naked and pay money for it. Because I'm not into that. All right, just one more coin. All the doors are closed for you. Shit, dude. Not even like a weird fetish niche that could work out. Dude, if Nintendo ever completely sues me, maybe I need to start an OnlyFans. Maybe that's the play. I don't know. You know what? This should go up. Actually, that would be even more confusing. Okay, but just because one person made that much money doesn't mean everyone will make that much money. That's like saying you need to play the lottery to retire. That's not a good argument. You know what I mean? 75 monthly impression would have been $13,000. Show me that. I don't believe that. That doesn't make any sense. There's no way that's real. That has to be like the 75 impressions is what got him monetized because he made a viral tweet. And then he bought Twitter premium. And then he got upset that he wasn't paid. He bought it after he got all the impressions or something like that. The one video I saw was you have to divide the impressions by roughly $8,000 to get the monthly income. So if we end up making like $5,000,000 a month divided by $8,000. $625. I actually know people who do OnlyFans. I never met anyone who actually does OnlyFans. Actually, I think AngyRuff did for some time. It's more common than you think. I'm actually surprised they actually make money off that. I expected at least 90% of creators to make less than $5 a month. At this point, the market has to be oversaturated, right? Yeah, I don't see a reason not to do it either. Why wouldn't you? It's literally free money, right? I would never hate on someone just making free money. And it seems like very little work too. Yeah. Yeah.  What is a seven-segment display? You mean for health? And it's inside the level? You can't just have a divided septagon or something? HelloIDAS? For one character? Oh. Hmm. So the easiest way to do this would be to have a texture. 1x8 point filtered. That doesn't make any sense. 16x8. Okay, 16x8. You have a 16x8 texture. And you color the pixels in. So that by just offsetting the texture upwards, you get a different character. Does that make sense? Do you understand what I mean? Maybe I can paint this. Yeah. You see? Okay, perfect. Perfect. Yeah, a single 8x16 texture. That's super cheap. And then you can just target it with the text scroll. You could even have to be in real time with the text scroll. Oh, that would be crazy. You don't even need to encode anything for it with Fast64. You can just do it. So do you mean the political tournaments and shit do it for the money and not for ideals? Yeah. No one does politics for the ideals. They all do it for the money. What do you mean? You can't spend your entire life on something that isn't your job, right? Seems pretty logical to me. Okay. Shit, there's one red coin missing and I don't know where to put it. When you spend a decade doing mods without being a job. Yeah, but I'm literally insane. I don't count here. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Doing a little grifting as a treat. I did cream. That was a good song. Okay. I'm not saying people shouldn't live anyway, like, people can do what they want. I'm missing a red coin. Where am I missing it? Did I not place the last one? I did not place the last one. Ew.  Or, like, if you want to live morally, how can you live without, like, giving almost all your money to people that are poorer? Because, like, you could give away, like, 90% of your income and save, like, 200 people's lives every month. How can you justify not doing that? Something I don't understand. Unfortunately, I don't care about it that much. But if I did care about it that much, like, I couldn't live in society. I don't know Hasan, and I don't know what PewDiePie has to do with politics. So this is kind of invisible right now, but it will be more visible once we have the thing going. The proper textures. No, the rain is in the music. Who is he saying this when he's making a game? Someone pumping me 7 euro per level. True, true, true. But am I wrong, though? So this is gonna be the section with the spikes. I'm not making 11k. At least, I don't think I am. Alright, so all the coins are in, and that works. Eh.  You don't make that much as a game programmer. I mean, I am pretty transparent about how much I make from RE64 hacking, right? You can just... I definitely shot my YouTube analytics before. Look, my analytics. $900 this month. Or in a year, it's like... $10,000. It's not that much. 11k is second true. Somewhat comfortable lifestyle with no kids. Even with kids, that's extremely comfortable. Right now, with kids, like, my monthly expenses is... In USD, it's like... $2,800. It's basically nothing.  I don't know, I hear a lot of people complain about the cost of living, and then they cite numbers that they have, like, higher living expenses alone than I have with a wife and the kids. $2,800 is twice minimum wage here. What is minimum wage in France? Isn't it like... I mean, in Germany, it's like 14 euros, right? 14 euros times 14 hours times... 52 weeks. It's like 29,000. And... Oh shit, that is more. Oh my god. Okay, but I do have to pay for my wife and my child, too. 1,400 a month? Oh god, that sucks. Hello, 0Volt. Welcome to the stream. Hmm... What about D? Height? Height should be like 50. The mortgage is gonna be making decent money. A mortgage is something you pay if you don't make money on it. Oh, right, you live in a really poor country, don't you, 0Volt?  Wrong with something, I think. If you program for a video game, it doesn't make that much money. I think in the video game industry, the wages are like something like 30% lower than outside video games.            The mortgage was already computed into the monthly cost. Making barely 1k. Okay, but that doesn't make any sense, right? As a web dev, you're remote. You can work for clients worldwide. Why don't you just work for a richer client? Well, the incentive to work in the video game industry is that you like doing it. Right, that's why the wages are lower in the first place, because it's something people want to do. Oh yeah, have I shown you guys this? Now, doesn't this look sus? Shwoop. There's a coin. Yeah, exactly. But that's why web devs should pay more. Or, I'm sure web dev does pay more. Average web dev salary. Surely. Median is 36 per hour. That's a ton, right? 75,000 in USD. This is like 55,000. It does, doesn't it? I really like this level. I already gave you this song for Zero Worlds. This is the one where there's four biomes and the song switches depending on where you are. So this is gonna be really cool with the song. You're gonna be here, and it's like a happy house theme. And then when you walk over here, it becomes the mountain theme. It's gonna add so much to the level. This is my favorite side of the level. Still not sold on the Styrofoam? Fair. You're not the only one. I think it looks spoopy because it's like the same things on the top and the sides. That's using, like, a sim. Oh, projectiles. Project 64 sound pack. Look, and now you just draw the star. I love that it actually comes out looking like a crayon drawing. Let's peek. I'm not sure what to do about the Styrofoam. Biobak was saying maybe cardboard where paper is stapled onto it. And yeah, that could probably look better. Still no Bluepencil Monsters cleared? It's on my to-do list. It's gonna happen. Okay, we have the incentive to permit mapped out though, so for today I'm feeling kinda done. Next, I'm gonna actually give this textures and hopefully make the platforming a bit less boring. But once it's the textures, I can see the level and then we can do things. I think this mission is going to be decent. It's not gonna be the best of the best, but, like, it works. It does what it needs to do. So, I will see you guys next stream.
