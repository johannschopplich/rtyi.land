Hello, hello.  Oh, my God. Restream is broken again. I will never use the software again. Terrible, terrible idea to rely on it. Hello, Clayman. Hello, Sully. Hello, Zeina. LateN64, sorry. I was taking a shit. Let me just pop out my chat here and here. Stop doing that, I would literally die.  All right, so I was working on this whole thing here. Oh, no, people started doing this on Twitter. They started giving me years. Insane. Any OST wishes for today? Yeah. Anything you guys would like to listen to? All right, let's do it.  Let's go. I saw Twitter to Nintendo. That's like the new me. That would be sick. Hello, Albert, hello, Super Mario fan, hello, Wimps, hello, VRT. Donkey Kong. The most messed up thing ever uttered from someone's mouth. I'm not sure I can hear this. I might just die. You never had a music recommendation go, well, well, but Sonic R is good, right? What could possibly go wrong here? Electric kill him. I don't understand. Oh. I didn't see you recommend anything then. You made some scales from the previous course. Wait, let me check this. I don't think I can add them to the course because this course is very low on memory. So it's probably going to be a no. Oh, yeah, we're on the new Blender 4 and I am not a fan of it. They messed up some important things. Oh, these. They are pretty cool. I do like them. Is it missing a texture or do you know? He didn't have the texture. Cool. Anyway, let me just show you what I have been doing in the past week. I was working on this level here that Biobak remade. I imported all the assets and there's some assets Biobak still wants to make. But so far so good, I would say. I already did all the areas here. The underground one is probably my favorite one. But I also like the office here. It just looks so pretty. The fuzzy does not look fuzzy at all. That's unfortunate. What are these emotes? Oh, I'm still missing Bowser here. I just realized Bowser's chair animations didn't do them yet. I also added lights here. You see that? Oh, there's light coming from the window. And here as well. Or here, there's light from the ceiling. And of course, the old secret remains intact. I'm not sure when I can get to the animation center. Probably like tomorrow or so. So yeah, maybe it makes sense to send them to me again. Isn't this cute? And yeah, today we're going to be working on more parts. Up there we want sparkles going along those lines. And then inside the factory we want a bunch of light effects. But I see I can't overlap the life bar. That's an issue for sure. Oh yeah, we have a really unfortunate render bug here. You see this? Nothing we can do about that. It's supposed to light up each ball individually. But Glideon has a bug here. Hello Skyloft. Oh, I guess I can show you guys the underground too. Real quick. This part looks pretty amazing if you ask me. Unfortunately there is a bug with the floor. Not working correctly with the oil fuzzies right now. I'm not sure why, but it should be fixable. It's the GameCube instead of N64. It does look really nice. Oh. Okay, something is bugged here for sure. I don't know why. Interesting. Yeah, the area is very dark. It just is what it is. How does that even happen? It looks like some of the ROM pointers break. Which breaks the music and the animations.  Like the DMA is just broken. Anyway, let's program this. Let's see what happens. Yes, there's a Donkey Kong Arcade one in the Treetops level, that is true. What are Crystals 14 and 15 going to be? Crystals 14 is going to be the Space Casino and Crystals 15 is going to be a Paper Craft level. It's going to be made entirely out of cardboard and stuff. I don't know if I want to make an RTYI Chaos Edition. I mean it could work, but also eh. You know what I mean? Just eh. Yeah, it does suck to play. Let's see what happens. Game Arenos? What is Pop'n Game Arena? Back in Game Arena I can't believe what I'm hearing. Sparkle Effect is a little long for what we want to do. Let's define a new one. Let's define Sparkle. Let's define Sparkle. Holly is here. Hello Holly. I never even played Sonic R, but the idea of a Sonic racing game is really fun. Could you even mention Sonic Adventure 2 having a racing mode? That doesn't fucking suck balls because you're just... Just wait a minute 15 times a second. That would be insane. Dude, I'm so sad that the Sonic Adventure 2 battle versus mode sucks. If you just removed the special abilities, it'd be so much better. Are you a dog, a cat or a Yoshi person? Definitely a cat person. I don't think you can get a Yoshi pet in real life, unfortunately. I don't think you can get a Yoshi pet in real life, unfortunately. That's very funny. You know what you're playing this weekend? Dr. Kawashima's brain training for the Nintendo DSi. Oh God, that is awful. Hey, do not hate on the cat gifs on my videos. They're great. In the city. What do you think about Mario Sunshine? What is your personal opinion on the game? I have so much hatred in my heart for Super Mario Sunshine. I hate the game to like an unreasonable degree. And it's because of the fucking cutscenes. And I'm not talking about the intro cutscene. I'm talking about the cutscene in every mission. It's like you want to play the game, but Nintendo's like fuck you. You don't get to play the game. Watch the star spawn. Watch the flower do a little dance. Watch this fucking thing happening. Dude, it's like every single time the game takes control away from me, it just feels like a small kick to my balls. What else can roto? I don't really care what I use. This one just works. I've heard all the reasons, but it's still not clear. Can we name an e-mail kill him? Oh. Can you ever turn into a sad cat when you see unoptimized codes like your videos? No. I have accepted that most code is written pretty unoptimized. I just turn into a sad cat when I have to deal with German bureaucracy. Well, even if you are just trying to get the bare minimum science required, you will still like explore the levels and find a lot of things that are practically dead ends because it's just a blue coin. Or because it leads to a star that isn't one of the first seven stars because that makes it worthless, right? Because only the first seven stars even matter at all. Let's see how this works out. I don't think I exported this yet. Let me do that first. All the stars matter if you're just trying to have fun. This is kind of true, but if you find out that they don't actually count towards anything, doesn't that kind of reduce how much fun you're having? Like when you're just not making any progress, you're just doing random things. I mean, I guess it's fun to see new stuff, but I guess not all the stars are new stuff to see, especially the blue coins. I remember this is my first memory of Mario Sunshine. I was at my cousin's house and we were wearing we were in a set of a called Rico Harbor. And there was a blue coin and I tried to collect the blue coin and my cousin said, Oh, don't bother with that one. That's just a saving coin. It doesn't do anything. All it does is save your game. These are star sparkles, not electrical sparkles. That's true, Biobak. But the game is not fun because of all the cutscenes just interrupting you all the time. Right. That's like, OK, there's like an extrinsic and an intrinsic motivation part of this, right? And the intrinsic motivation for me is ruined because all the cutscenes and the extrinsic motivation is ruined because most of it doesn't matter. So. Every time I encountered. I think of how he pronounced it and for the angels like How did I pronounce it? Did I call him choice? Yes choice Like that that's what he's called Zeus Sure Typical Americans. Oh, yeah, this is the Greek God. His name is sauce. He's fucking shooting Thunderbolts How's he pronounced in the original Roman Latin thing does anyone know That's the one opinion I will accept You think choice is more appropriate. Yeah Did you know they call plot on Plato Who's plot on do you mean Plato? Plato Wait, but I mean for Zeus No way Wait size and Zeus is the Greek name not the Roman name What's the Roman name then Roman is Jupiter. Oh, I thought I was the other way around I Am responsible to not being a planet anymore The definition of planet is very arbitrary It's there's things that are like almost a planet but not really and then there's things that are like a planet but almost not really it's like Being a planet is a spectrum guys You can't just say Pluto is a planet or not It is a celestial body I will agree with you on that It's pronounced CEO's CEO's Doesn't matter anyone is a coward Insane implications for our TMI and OBB To they're actually still really good and I just found hey I've been replaying the game and watch gallery games and you should too They're actually still really good and I just found something that I either never knew or completely forgot about so modern oil panic It's a dual screen game where you play as Mario and you need to catch the oil that Bowser is ripping down into the burning Building and feed it to Yoshi because it's his favorite food If you feed Yoshi two full buckets of oil when he's on either side of the building He'll make a block doing that again on the right side We'll either break the block for coins and bonus points or doing it on the left We'll have Yoshi continue to build a block staircase He can take up to Bowser to attack and get more bonus points You do it one time Yoshi hops up there and he spits a little fireball at Bowser Just like he does to make the blocks you do it a second time Yoshi hops up there and he throws an egg at Bowser You know like in Yoshi's Island do it a third time He hops up there. He eats a melon spits seeds at him Do it a fourth time and you know, she pulls out a fucking pistol and shoots It's that real that doesn't seem real Zeps Zeps I Didn't say nothing more like I'm pretty sure so somewhere for me what's being a little mention maybe we don't know You'll see it's all and canonically has a gun that has to be a shitpost. I don't believe it Hmm Okay, maybe we should just give this a model ID I Was gonna make this a goomba for a bit and see how to actually I don't think we have goodness here Model Mario fuck it We should see a bunch of floating Mario's now along the spine hopefully As it's got running on n64 The performance is basically not moved at all. If anything, it's slightly better because my back removed a lot of pictures What the hell why are all my Mario's over here Oh All right Okay, first of all, actually I should make one change here and then it's we need an electric sparkles I Keep this in a final level and now I think if we want free jumpscare true I'm basically they are not being in the correct positions yo it's the modder guy it is me they're moving somewhere but like not towards the correct goal it's like there's just some kind of memory corruption going on and they're just going to some random value well not memory corruption but rather just reading a random pointer which doesn't make sense because these are all segmented pointers to validator so how can this be unless I'm reading the values wrong I said you ain't victory us nope this should be fine your apes are all gone you lost all your nfts why is gargoyle in this stream tags oh you're not gonna believe this it's because you need to gargoyle my balls big blunder fuck you we got another one welcome to the club there should just be a permanent role given to everyone who fell for it let's fucking go who's gonna be a ceo and this guy's looking to hire for triple the money and you're gonna fucking jonas from gears was on my chat once he is technically my boss if I get to gargoyle him that would be amazing because I'm not edward gallus I can make jokes like that this is the wild west not safe for work well we are not at work fuck you I work at nasa now tweet threat okay I should concentrate on this and try to figure this out because this is actually quite the issue has to be related to these just being wrong right I hate you slash serious that was definitely a boss fight you encountered reminds me of back in the old days and mmos see okay in german mmos people would just like some people would make these edgy names and they would always be called like black thunder dark violence you know what I mean okay now kaiser romex are named oh I don't know kaiser romex very well what if this is just being calculated wrong how about we disable all of them except for one for a bit and then we just see you with some prints what's happening do you know what a thunderclap is nope twisted dreams of fragments are some bullshit I thought that was like cho who names because all of brony attacks sound like that too okay so for some reason he's just going here with opacity zero meaning this is the first waypoint on electric line zero which doesn't make any sense because we know the first waypoint is right here what the fuck are sonic songs about they're just random shit to sound cool honestly I kind of like that though the mara clones are just debug visuals so that I can follow where this is like being positioned why don't you put on almost that from sonic from shadow the hedgehog did the shadow the hedgehog have you guys seen the intro scene from shadow the hedgehog the video game oh my god it goes so hard I saw it for the first time not that long ago and I thought I was about to play the best video game of all time just from the intro hello trustworthy no the original I am NOT gonna play generations generations has 2d sections generations actually insane somehow they took the problem of not being able to see the level that is everywhere in 2d sonic and they applied it to 3d sonic and introduced it on purpose literally how do you manage to even like what to sonic games all bad unlike shadow games which are goated yeah you do fly past them in a second but also they made the levels so then you have to like go around curves all the time and you can't see what's behind the curve so you like have to slow down and I cannot just refuse so I just boost and fall off all the time okay so the issue has to be in here somehow how can this be wonder if I have to use like minus target pitch even skin issue yeah I'm sorry for not just knowing what the level is in advance ace rap video about microseconds yeah I don't think that's happening anytime soon 6575 negative yeah that seems right to me this is so weird big dream team I have not so excellent but maybe I should just what made me realize and accept that something works way better than 3d it's just that they don't give a wait this is an issue oh I see what I did wrong this should be fine I do have to do the math twice now actually I can just prevent that this should be better I don't know my experience with Sonic Forces was I got the game I put on a blindfold and then I played the game and I beat the level the first level blindfolded and then I look back at the footage and I noticed in the footage just the entire game was bugging out and like interrupting so I don't know if I would call that polished I didn't always find a way to find out somehow even though like the physics of the reasons I like the Sun service in your file yeah and even back then they were just like you know but Sonic's too fun let's add the Eggman and tail stages let's add fucking froggy fishing oh yeah and back down really bad for me Skyloft wait maybe I have the video somewhere oh I can't watch it right now because I'm streaming otherwise I would pull it up I have an unlisted video of me playing the first level of Sonic Generations as Sonic Forces blindfolded and just bugging out while I was blindfolded so I couldn't help me tell my character about what's one three eight eight four times 50 okay that's actually easy you can just do this left to right right so you get four four two zero six five six nine four two zero he tricked me that's the funny number I'm trying my best to find a leader and he didn't take it well, unlocked himself the party's office. I'm trying to optimize all this math out so this is fine, but for some reason it's going in the wrong direction. Oh wait, it's going towards the first blind point and then the distance here is super high for some reason. Let's see what's up with that. It's word factual, am I being serious about words? Do you think politics are real until you study modern french politics and you stumble upon iEvilKizme and it feels like they're just fucking with you. Yeah I am being serious about Sonic Forces, that is exactly what happened to me. I forgot the SQR, okay now it works. I'm not even gonna test if it works, I just know it works. French are in panic over EvilKizme, not EvilKizme. We started watching season 4 of the boys recently, which I know it's kind of like a trashy show but it actually just hits my brain just right, it might be my favorite show and it's really good and they are kind of like making fun of a lot of politics too and I saw people complain that season 4 is super woke because smartest person in the world in the show is like a black woman and they're like no way, don't wait, not on my watch. Okay, the marios are sliding along. Trashy it's so good, the show is definitely trashy like you cannot bullshit yourself here. Fairworthy, this game has how many worlds, 15. There's so much like useless violence and like close-up of people's buttholes in the show like it is a trashy show, I think that's fair to say. Okay what I don't like about this is that the marios here on the left are much more thinner spread than the ones on the right. And I'm seeing a show with another close-up shot of inside someone's dick. Yeah exactly, exactly my point. Put in the secret ring so CR, let's do it. I know that it has one banger theme, dude I got this game I was so excited because the music goes so hard and then I played the game and I was no longer excited. Level keys may ruin sonic, it's so over. No such thing as play for those who speak. A path out of time instead of just living it. So many things erased before they begin. Homes on dream instead of what could have been. My first sonic game and I had to be a flop. Okay but if you pick a random sonic game as your first sonic game there's a very very good chance that you're just gonna get garbage like there's like two and a half good ones. I won't say which ones though because sonic fans will argue with me but y'all know, y'all know the two I'm talking about and the half one. Hello Welsay. Let them argue it's good for chats that's true. Well I mean the way I phrased it was maximized for arguing right by me just withholding the information on what the two and a half good ones are. I am excited to play the project 06 thing, the sonic 6 remake. I feel like that one could go really hard. Nothing at all just memes. This looks pretty nice I think. I think there could be more. Would it be feasible to use the memory expansion so to plug in a custom PCB that has a TPU and I can read game data? I mean I guess you could technically just put a thing on your N64 that just beams a screen render in and then just run fucking Fallout 4 or whatever you want. I don't know what's a modern game GTA 5, 6. Yeah, what do you think? You like my contraption? I'll make the sparkles quite a bit bigger actually.  So there's 100 resolution? Yeah, it's gonna be like just one or two pixels blinking. That's better. I think I should make them faster too. There should be Goonies on the wires. No. Did a game called Rewind. It's a gem of a game that was made in 1989. Does it get much recognition? Nope, never heard of it. What happens when you touch the fuzzy spiky guy? I can show you. You shouldn't touch fuzzy because if you touch fuzzy you get dizzy. Oh, that crane is definitely missing some fog. Oh, that looks crazy. Okay, wait, you haven't even seen all of it yet.     You're gonna like this even better now. Once I show you what happens. Listen to the music. How fucking cool is that effect, dude? Alright, let's bring back the fog on the crane. That Levukism stole from me. Can you show me how the fans look when they spin? Sure, I will let you know. I'm not a big fan of how they look. So you might have an idea. YouTube poop type effect? No, this is like the recorder rewinding. Alright, let me just make sure this works fine. And show Bioblade the fan. That's cruel. Well, you kind of will do the same here, but you're kind of struggling more to stay alive here. Here's what the fans look like. I think the color of the fans is a little off compared to the rest of this, right? It's like the lighting from the world doesn't affect them. Did I not import yours? I did. I tried to. Did I not? Did I get the wrong one? You're right, this doesn't look like yours. Wind Turbine and Wind Turbine 2? Oh, this is the sideways one, I think. I think there's one sideways one and one upward one. Let me just make sure. Yeah. Okay, here are yours. That looks a lot better. That is not my fan. Patronity test has come out. It is in fact not your fan. Yeah, yeah, we love you Jerry Springer. Sorry, sometimes. Sometimes I just go kind of off a tangent. That makes no sense. The neurons in my brain, they just fire sometimes and I am not putting out the fire. Did you hear about the Midori incident? No. Hello, Aaron Moneybag Yang. How's it going, Mr. Moneybag Yang? I don't know who Mori is. I just know Jerry Springer. Midori is a Persona League and everyone was having an impression they were a Japanese woman. Turns out it was some white guy LARPing. What a surprise. Wow. No way. Wow, a Persona fan groomed someone? No way. You should have been more careful. You know what? If I get lickmat because I am not careful, so be it. I can take it. Oh, there we go. That's a lot better. Oh, that was a cool move. I like that move. That felt nice. That felt awful. Oh, there we go.    That was nice. I didn't really care if there is evidence. I don't know this person. I don't think anyone else does. Surely this is something that the police should worry about and not Twitter. What? That can happen? The factory platforms are working now. No, that would be next on our list. Well, I have imported the factory platforms, but they are not doing the shining stuff yet. Or actually, I don't think that's next on my list. That's further down on my list. But it is on my list. I definitely need to add cool light effects tomorrow here. But yeah, look, this is unfortunately going to be bugged forever. This is a Glideon bug. Nothing we can do. Let's see. Make spark particles move along. Okay. When hitting a fuzzy, the prim colour on the decals at the edge of the ocean and in the NPG need to change. And do not update Mario's safe position when hanging on an edge. Okay. I'm kind of just going through the change log here. And making all the changes we have, like from top to bottom. This is our current to-do list. So let's look into the fuzzy. Let me see how the fuzzy effect looks broken again. Did I forget to follow active quads? Nope, it's broken. It is what it is. I love software. Okay, yeah, you see this rim here? That's awful. We don't want that rim there. Oof. Or do we? I think the rim kind of ruins the effect a little bit. Let's see if we can fix that. Wayback, have you ever figured out how to pick a colour in this new blender version? I can't seem to do it. Because I don't know the exact RGBs here. Look at this again. No, I need to know the vertex colours. I need to pick the vertex colour. Otherwise I switch to the second random mod and change it to attributes-vertex, that's not much I understand. Switch to second random mod, well there's only one here, you mean the two cycle here? Oh! And then this is the exact vertex class? Ah, if that works that's perfect, let's see if it changes if I apply this. It does not. Oh, that is exactly what I needed. Let me just make sure this works and if it does then we can just make that also be the prim color. The balls next to the 3D render settings at the top, oh! I thought so too but it does this. Usually it gives me the vertex class in this mode but not in 4.1, or 4.0 I don't know which one you want. Hello, you are making amazing work, bye, bye Terrafin. I don't know, everyone was only in Python console. No I needed to pick the color, I needed to get the color, like needed the exact hex value, that was the issue here. Change to flat plus vertex, oh! Okay, okay, so we got that, next we need the fake V-Alpha material and when you are in the fuzzy we need to change that as well. After Star Road and through the ages, what mod do you, which mod do you recommend to play? A 64-inch, Delty is in YouTube chat, I don't understand what he is saying. We are stalking Delty, the Sonic Cinema Series really ended before they got Sonic and, Sonic and the Son of God, wait what? Was Sonic gonna be the Son of God in the new thing? What if, we make this a little easier. That doesn't make any sense, but I just, actually it does make sense. There we go. If I did everything right, then the rim will now be the same color. What's handy from Bridges, this is a legma. Hey, let's just make sure it also resets correctly. That's not good, that's not the color I wanted, not what I ordered, either way mostly good, except for having to deal with German bureaucracy, which I really, really hate. I'm in a good mood. What's extra bad for me, because I haven't been living in Germany for almost three years now. But they just won't leave me alone. I'm gonna play Retro Slide by Rovert, surely a very awesome game. How does it not reset back to 2.55? Let me just see what happens now. There we go! Then orange. He's clearly saying Echidna dude. You are being an Echidna dude. The Echidna dude lives inside you. The wood lies dude that lives inside you. The Echidna dude lives inside you. How is this possible? I am so confused. How is it orange? I'm not changing the shade color. I've never seen a Mycock spit like a menace. True. I have never actually seen a Mycock spit like a menace. How is this possible? Hmm. Wait, the ocean at the background resets to normal and it's doing the exact same math. Let me look at this in an emulator. It's a bit more of an accurate emulator. Some dog, what you eat, food. You know my flight and free knuckles, we're at the DMV, you ready? Dude, that's the kind of motivation I need. I would not, I would prefer to just have knuckles with me at the DMV. Nope, the back is there, even in the menu. Wait, is it maybe because I didn't export this? It could be. Don't shut XS. Oh, why so tight? I do, I just outgrow my stuff, not much I can do about it. Maybe Zeina washes it too warm and maybe I just gained too much weight. Is selling a new buy new clothes? I don't like spending money. Yep, I just had to export a level. Cool, cool, cool, cool. All right, so we got that solved. Next, do not update Mari's safe position when hanging on ledge. Let me see if I can recreate this bug here. But as long as Mari stays in the wet cement, people will get really upset. You ruined it! Just realized something's wrong with this, you ruined the post. Nothing happens, except you just draw lines in it. Guys, I can't draw the cool XS. I think I need more space for that. The footsteps got removed. No, the footsteps are still here. You can see them. It's just that when you crawl, you make a thicker line. Do not update Mari's safe position when hanging on a ledge. Right, that's our next to-do item. So the thing is, sometimes you can get into a situation where Mari was like soft-locked, where you can't respawn, and I don't know the replication conditions for that. So I'm trying to recreate the bug right now. You have Internet Explorer in the taskbar? You guys wanna see my Internet Explorer? It's not even edged, it's a good old one. It's the porn shortcut. Yeah, Biobak caught me. It's the Iris shortcut. Maybe I need to find a ledge that Mario can't actually grab. What about one of these here? Dude, how did we manage to find the way to get stuck there? Let me just look at the code for it, and maybe I can look at the code and find the bug. What song is this? This song is called Inside You, it's an Echidna duet. And it's from Sonic and the Super Bombers. Wow.  Let's see. I don't think it needs to be 1, I think 0.8F is fine. But that's unrelated to the bug anyway. I found a typewriter comment, oh no! Hello, Eiza. I don't know what to do.   So, I guess this can happen with a downwarp? I am the real case, EizaEasy. I'm not just a scammer.  I'm not just a scammer.  I'm not just a scammer.  Yeah, I guess this could happen with a downwarp. I will not reveal my search bar, XCR. There might be confidential info in there. Hello, Hinovator. Hinovator. In German, right? You know what, just to be safe, I usually don't do safety stuff, but just to be safe, I can do this. Actually this might actually be Satan, because what if someone actually does find a way to move fast. What are you cutting right now? We are working on the remake of OnlyBodyMay, and we're doing some fixes. Next is add a special camera to the elevator. The Germany game, of course, the game that was happening in Germany. Did I go there, what do you think? Oh yeah, these no longer hurt you, they're just little friends now. So we need the camera like here maybe? Just like hard-coded here to look at Mario, I think we can do that. We're thinking in a corner. Like so? Yeah, this works. RTY does use a lot of Mario 64 soundfonts, but they also have a lot of custom sounds. No, we're not adding a security camera scanline effect. Guys, okay, fun fact, I played Five Nights at Freddy's for the first time last week, and I'm extremely confused how people could possibly like this. V1510, you're playing in the German national team? That's fucking crazy. Thank you for the sub, Zita Zita. The game is garbage. Dude, my experience was I opened the game and I sat there, not knowing what to do. I was just looking at random cameras for five minutes and nothing was happening. So I just kind of put the controller down and I just waited because it was like, what the fuck am I supposed to do? And then a jump scare happened, like after me waiting for like three minutes. And I was just standing there like, huh? I wasn't even looking when the jump scare happened. I just heard like a sound. I was like, oh, I guess I died. Yes, James, there is. Five Nights at Casa's. Sure would be a better game than that. I have played Okami and it is pretty good. Dude, Okami actually got so much mileage out of so little content. That's actually crazy what they did. I do have a Discord. It should be linked somewhere in my descriptions. There we go. Hard positions. Slops like a bus. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I don't know. I think I can remove Fazano's comments here, because that's just cringe and wrong at this point. It means good, I see. I need some more stuff in the hard positions. Oh, I see. So I can set it to 32767 to make it not be set. So, perfect. I already thought about this. All right. Wow, wow, wow. What a song. I want to hear an acapella version of this song. There would be someone in the background just going wow, wow, wow. Let's hear it. Yes. Yes. It's only 3.30, but I'm feeling so exhausted already, I guess because I've been working even before I started the stream. That is the Secret Wings OST. Let's hear it. Let's hear it. I think. It already makes sense. Let's see. 2 and 5 actually have the elevator move, right? Yeah. Let's hear it. Is that not how you do it? What the hell? Hard positions undeclared. Makes sense. Oh, we're not listening to this awful song here. Any other OST wishes? Chinese takeaway restaurants. I'm sure they do. You know what? I need to ask you guys. Do they have kebab in Canada? Because I don't see it and I want the kebab, but they just don't have it anywhere. All they have is fucking doner, which is just worse kebab. It's like they take the kebab and they took out the good lettuce and they just put sharp in there. Just like, fuck you and your tongue. I hope you burn. You're oily from how good looking the game is getting? That's good. It's kebab.  You cannot change my mind. They put sharp. Yes. That's what the Canadians do. Vancouver. Oh, God. All the way over there. Hello, Delta. What the fuck does that mean? Okay. People often say spicy, but I just disagree with that because spicy like salt is a spice, you know, spicy is not very descriptive, but sharp as in like it pierces your tongue and it hurts. I think that's the right word. Yeah. See you, Zaina. Zaina has to go because her mom said, Nope, you're done. That's enough out of you. You're messed up. I'm right, though. You also think cheddar is spicy? No. Well, I mean, it is a spice in a way, but it's not spicy. I'm just saying spicy is a terrible word. And sharp is much more fitting. Just order it without sharp, but then you still don't have the lettuce and stuff. Still just a shitty kebab. Okay. I guess we have no OST, so let's listen to Twilight Princess. Stuck for a second to make a bad speech bubble case. Imagine y'all talking about kebab. Yep. How is it not knowing this? It's good values, neither having no pointer, no vector. But it is here. There we go. Man who uses a different one because the sensation is better. Wait, what? The sensation is better. Nice French taco. Honestly, that doesn't sound too bad. Dude, it's honestly so simple. You just take bread, you put some lettuce in there and you put some meat in there and you have a good meal. And they looked at that and they were like lettuce. No, here's onion. And tomato. It's messed up if you ask me. The fuck? That was a buck. Well, it is in the corner, but. Not the way I want. Not spiced like peppers. Yeah, I think it's from the onion. I'm not sure if it is. At any rate, it hurts your tongue if you eat it too fast. Colors is pointy. Pointy, maybe minty. Raw onion tastes sharp. Exactly. Yo, I don't know.  That's good. Glad you liked it. Uber and Kiki, but for food. Yeah, yeah. It's just what humans do. Raw red onion overpowers everything. That's probably what it is. You barely get to enjoy the nice meat and the bread because it's just sharp. But when you get a kebab and all the ingredients mix, you know, it's just perfect. Kebab might just be the best food in the world. Especially since I haven't had one in like a long time. Rammstein. Oh, this is weird if you jump. I don't know why. But then what's the point of it? Isn't the point of red onion to add like sharp to the food? Kebab pizza sounds good, too. I don't think I've ever had those. I really want to try you one day. You know, the chocolate milk. One day, I will treat myself to a bottle of you. I don't think I've ever had those.    True, true. Onions do have a very nice texture. Very crunchy. Why is the camera doing this? I'm not a fan. Oh because When I jump there's no longer my floor Makes sense actually Fuck And we don't use true in this world we use one But actually insanely good peanut butter and peeled onion sandwich That does sound crazy He's crushed in the doors, you know You who is a chocolate drink not chocolate milk Wait, so what else is a new who if not milk I I thought I was just chunky and milk and a bit of sugar or something There were two things I needed to change Right and the hard positions the cam needs to be moved out a little bit I Don't know You'll thank you for this up in gaming life Very pronounceable name good choice of name I Think there should be a death animation at place when my fault's in the oil you can just respawn with less health I don't want that to be that punishing for no reason, you know, I Think it's not really necessary that we just kill the player You Seven two zero. Okay, so three six zero You Same with the x-axis And beans are sliced sausage and corn I Sliced some that's a poor people recipe My poor people recipe was just potato wedges You Good potato wedges are good too. I gotta miss them Just eat like a whole pack of them and then feel like you're gonna get a heart attack Awesome Not that the constant methods will be recipe toast sandwich I Just if anything doesn't run in slices, which may be better. Oh god, that looks awful This is real It's not real We sure is a Why are we doing this what's the point on this to bully me? To heckle me I Still does this why How does Mario jumping affect us Doesn't make any sense does it See a Karen have fun with your ramen I Think more more more oily That is actually an idea Kenna where if you fall off We're gonna have like an oil decal on top of Mario that like disappears over a few seconds. I Think it could work really well Nope doesn't make any sense. Let me just add a printer just to make sure That everything's going fine, that's the print disappear if I jump on the thing The case you have emoji I see is uh It's not gonna be my profile picture. It's actually just me in low quality on Twitch I See I Say about jumping in a way that fakes true Now is this back on the nerve grinds I See a misaligned vertex here. Oh wait, that's not the cameras just kind of clipping into it That's stinky I can fix it Still need to fix this part here I mean noted down. It's in backgrounds to It's the cables from the elevator camp, yeah, I'm gonna fix it or I have a plan So what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna make it so that the camera is gonna be stuck Further in the elevator like by like 40 coordinates and Then we're gonna take the actual elevator here the collision map And we're just gonna move it in for the units The inaccuracy should not be noticeable and this should keep the player from getting themselves into a pickle The back cable was yeah, don't worry about it I Many speed kicks. Do you think I can do in a row? Well, not like that because there's no place to go one one two thing There we go kinda I Can move the camera just a little bit more forward Even it just falls off if you jump too much There's already a similar. You say curious, huh? Look at this. No get me out. Get me out. I didn't want to be in the elevator I Can't look at this I can go there check out the elevator and come back out And now you can be here isn't that cool Can't see the elevator moving. What's the point? Well, you just saw it moving no I kinda don't like how poopy this wall looks Let me see if I can do anything about that No, it's just a restriction Why is the collision weird The collision on the elevator floor that's a bug and it's something I looked into fixing but it's a bit complicated Nope there's not I just go to run the media videos You Yeah, special cam and elevator is there at background to the tower window Okay. So what are we thinking? Just the oily body made backgrounds just like the normal one or anything special? You Here's bring out like it's the back of the tower it isn't but let's pretend it is okay Well, yeah, I guess it's kind of to the side of the tower I I Guess you would realistically see nothing from there. So it's the opposite side of the power plant Oh Okay, I kind of like this Except for that part, but this party is really cool Yeah, shall we just add the water below as well Bit more opaque. Yeah agreed I Was this again he told me before I Said it's not this Was it not just attributes down It's cool that you can set all these things here I did not know Unfortunately, the texture is still saved here so are the RGB You It's one zero zero zero zero one this evening doesn't one Said that's the first one binary or you said just a big number. I Guess it's a big number. Otherwise, it wouldn't be in groups are free And that means I have no idea if that's true or not I See and then Shit I feel like I read that comment way too late. He was talking about the elevator camera Oh, there we go, oh, that's nice All right, that's another thing on my to-do list done The last thing I might to do this for this room here is at the elevator music inside the elevator Because we don't have any right now I Did the coins to you collect all five you get a bonus star There will be a radar for those that you get after you get like free or something. I'm not sure yet. I Think collecting free to get a radar. It's like a fun way of doing it Area Free move to janitor throwing the soap out of the cage. Have him talkable as an easter egg with Biobaks text. Oh God, oh god. What happened here? Something broke It's an always like that or just when I leave me into the area It's always like that God damn it. I Thought I fixed this But I notice another thing I did wrong Probably yep I Should do it I think I'm done for today We made some good progress. Next up would be the boss area and then all the the factory stuff Hopefully I can finish that this weekend and then next week we can finally go back to the ice castle where we've been stuck for a bit So, I will see you guys in the next stream, bye bye
