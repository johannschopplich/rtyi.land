You Hello. Oh, there we go. You can hear me now? Yeah, I realized my mic was off after I started Yo Sonic, thank you for the 15 months. I don't know why every time I open a fast64 file now I get the notification that I need to upgrade my materials. Hello Selton We're working on this today It's so fucking cold in my room. I wish there was a way to make it warm, but there isn't LOD waver What's the plan today? We're gonna be working on the Astral Arcade We now finally have a plan for the level and we can start 3D modeling Any OST wishes? Damn, this looks cool. That's good. Very good So let me remember this. We have the main area and below the main area is all the flipper pieces So we should probably make the flipper pieces first Let's get a list of flipper pieces that we want to make On the Gamecube N64 emulator? I don't know. I mean if the Gamecube N64 emulator is programmed well, for sure. If it's not, then nope Mario Galaxy? Alright, let's just do Mario Galaxy. By the way, I have a new microphone. Did you guys notice? What are your thoughts? So definitely, um, flipper piece that rotates and brings the ball up What other flipper pieces are there? Do you guys like it? Do you guys not like it? Spherical bumper that pushes you in the direction you came from? Happy enough time? That would have been a good one What do you think? Do you think it sounds good? Very nice. It sounds the same? No way What if I get closer to the microphone? It's supposed to sound better if you're close up to it And I think my old microphone sounded really bad when I was close up The noise reduction is maybe a bit too sensitive. That's NVIDIA Broadcast. I can turn it down a little bit Is this better? That's not part of the microphone. This is way better up close. Oh, that's nice Yeah, so production volume of my videos is gonna go up, hopefully Sounds much better when you're up close. That makes sense, but unfortunately It just falls over because it's so heavy, the new microphone So I can't just, you know, hold it up here Which really sucks Oh, I can do that, but now I can't see the chat Maybe I need a new microphone stand I think this is the best I can do for now Once the level is done, we have a few actors done, but there's still some stuff to do So right now, I'm looking for flipper pieces. What about the wormhole? The wormhole is fun How would I make that look? Definitely the triangular pieces here Triangular piece that bumps you in the direction that it points at Hmm I think there's more than just the ones I listed, right? This would be lame if that was all of them Isn't there a stage in Sonic Heroes? Is there no park? Ah, I guess there's the triangles that always shoot you up We have the circular bumpers, we have the flippers Hmm, we have to keep in mind that the ones we make have to work in 3D space, so we can't do all of this Yeah, it will be completely different, Clayman, don't worry I know what I'm doing, have some confidence in me Hello, Hedgehog Gamer So I don't know what it is, but recently I've been getting so much more annoyed at like my YouTube comments and stuff It's kind of not good I don't know why it's suddenly starting to bother me again Hmm Is there really only like three flipper pieces? No way Hmm How many are in here This, this and these I guess there's also this, but we can't have that. We can't do anything that gives you coins. Can we just invent flipper pieces? Ooh, this is a very good thing to find I Like the metal pieces here, the metal pieces can be just there as visuals, right metal pieces that you can just stand on Do we need to connect all of this with No, we don't this can just float in space space is crazy like that. I think it's just float Hmm How can we do the speed stripes in free space without a back wall Like speed tunnels that if you go in there and they just shoot you up Trampoline pieces that just shoot you up like this. Yeah That could work a trampoline piece That just shoots you up kind of like a button type thing a button string type thing Yo, it's your birthday congratulations the 30th of november God it's so cold in here Yeah Do you like dragon ball I like dragon ball a lot God I have so many so controversial dragon ball opinions I'm, probably the worst person to talk about dragon ball, too Unless you share my controversial opinions So I think that's enough pieces. Actually, let's make those pieces. We need a theme for it Um, we can't just make this be random. Actually, we can just make this random pieces But they gotta they gotta be themed after something. I think it would be a lot better if they were I Should I should have kept this open Just so I can see the shape so this is gonna be the pedal that is gonna hit you Seems to be a good length Opinions such as what Okay, so for myself personally i've decided that dragon ball super is not canon it just never happened Because like if it did happen that'd be really stupid So Or like I just disagree that super saiyan is a 50 times multiplier that's that's just not how anything in the series works I think all that the fan generated dragon ball content about like power levels and stuff is just like stupid and Just not how the series works. Actually I Haven't watched all of daima yet, but I have really high hopes for dragon ball daima So And this might be biased but I will also say that the german top of dragon ball is like the best up out there So Hello Welcome to the space level So my goal today is to 3d model and program the flippers hopefully Hope this gives you some health inspiration. Let's see what this is rocket robot on wheels No way they have a flipper Oh, this is a carnival level Throwing stuff like that is too random from r64 That's a really cool idea though, I have this texture I have these textures wise guy sent them to me Is course 15 just a slight over difference very very different Oh shit, I forgot They gave me free sunflower seeds they said I can have these sunflower seeds if I eat them on stream for free So I will do that So, um I'm fucking stupid. I don't know how to open them Let's eat them on stream see if they're any good Anyone else like sunflower seeds Did my stream crash The whole website just froze What the fuck Anyone else still here stream is online. All right Let's eat them on stream Oh, it tastes like sunflower seeds. This is um OG bold flavor flavored sunflower seeds. They gave me a bunch of really good flavors I don't know what exactly they want. They just sent them to me for now I don't know what i'm supposed to do. I imagine they will still tell me I Remember when I was in university And whenever I came home to my parents they would just not have food at home So I bought a giant bag of sunflower seeds and just ate them when I was home I don't know why they didn't buy food though Like The only food my parents had at home was like chocolate and pudding So I didn't want to eat chocolate and pudding for like a whole month Yeah, those sunflower seeds are pretty banger I actually have two insane video ideas coming up soon The first is um, there's like an entire megabyte of n64 memory that we can use Which is crazy like a full megabyte. You have eight by default. You get a whole new one. Like that's insane And the other is about the cache Which doesn't sound very insane at first but that's like the best thing that ever happened to the n64 From which company are they? Um, they're called smacking sunflower seeds Let me see if they want anything else from me Smacking sunflower Would you like to try smacking's variety pack and share the experience with the audience? Here's what's in it for you 20% commission on every sale you refer exclusive 10% discount access to training resources to maximize your earnings Um, yeah, I don't know what my my link is so I can't give you the discount yet just wait until next week Will I die now So Dude, it's almost the time for functions. Can you imagine? Christmas just four weeks away This looks so terrible So Foreign I Show again course 15 Is it doing that Okay, well this texture is still awful so I don't like this The Texture on top should definitely be different from the texture on the side. It's not anything but hello Belzer I See ya, it's a Course called astral arcade. It's an arcade in space Not rainbow, right? You know, I have to eat this whole pack on stream for two counts I can't eat that much Are you supposed to eat them with the shell or without? I Don't actually know I'm stupid that's kind of a nice look I Never met anyone who eats a shield, but am I supposed to crack them one by one? Usually the handful of Sunverse is with the shot. Yeah, what did you do? Do you like peel them out Huh That's completely unreasonable now you're tripping I Supposed to take the wrapper of the burger, okay, but Burger is reasonable the sunflower seeds. You can't take the shell of every individual one That's crazy The only reason I was thinking maybe I'm not supposed to eat the shell is because the shell doesn't taste as good as the inside I Next to telling me you eat cucumber without the shell that would be a crime And this week unfortunately haven't had much time to work on our team I because off stream I have to work a sec here This is something that I was commissioned to work on a long long time ago and then the person commissioning this Just send money again, and it's like I have to do this now. I can't just leave the heck where it is So basically there's a bunch of cities you can visit let's go to New York There's a radio in this And you can kill people in this And you can sell drugs There's a Luigi cop, let's kill him Yeah, he's in a blood bottle right now I Make help with this a long time ago to like he meets the most city here Oh And this is where you buy drugs what do we want to buy mescaline This is like an edgy 2000s YouTube parody of Mario This Luigi's trying to kill me There's also Chinatown here And who's that a gang of Waluigi's and I would kill with my uzi And he dropped LSD no mescaline I was something was wrong with the texture As again you always a little bit the shells I mean taking the shell off is waiting for the work, right? Well, I get sick from meeting the shell They do really like the pink panther I think I think you're right Think this is kind of an interesting look for it. I think this could work something like this We're gonna have to make this one here glowing a little bit You get this to look right Like what if this one was glowing and then as soon as you landed on it and shut you up I Think that's a good play I But yeah that Hank is gonna Keep me very busy over the next few days, unfortunately So I can only get little work done on our team I Don't get any last work on the heck long I what I thought it would have been the right from I do I but that doesn't work Yes, now the sack was made before I do I I even started I think You Like Mars medical pictures so actually You know, some people have misophonia where they listen to a sound and it's like so jarring to them I Think the Mario metal cap texture is the visual equivalent to that As in like the full picture mental cat Mario obviously looks great but like looking at the picture for the texture look Makes me feel some kind of way and it's not a good way Okay And I want the inside to glow and the outside to be somewhat dark and I wanted to glow in color I See what we have to do Where is primitive I'm a fucking blind, huh? Yeah Make sense on send a shockwave through my whole body really strange feeling that's interesting that that's possible to have And then an existed I Must have some harmless just strange You've got the people me disease basically Why so serious Are you referencing the Joker for some reason that I don't understand I Am confused That looks terrible Right I'm not crazy here. This looks terrible What if instead of just that it looks like the whole petal and the whole petal was like growing like growing like this And then as soon as you jump on it, it just shoots you up Might be better You Get question if someone calls you a snowflake, what are you supposed to respond? I Said learning c++ any recommendations What do you mean by you will start running it you're gonna go to university or something How does this work I Think this goes pretty hard for the flipper we can do that What I don't like is that the edge here is and I think I don't know the other sides Maybe I can just say fuck it and do this I Think that's good. Actually, I'm sure I'm Biobak will improve this anyway, and for now And it's an aggression and shit What do you mean? You'll try at least You think this is already peak Okay, I think this flipper piece is fine Next one is a spherical bumper so I'm gonna make these elements all together and then You can look at them and see if we can find any improvements How do you learn to use blender programming and the other stuff so you just started doing it all To learn blender you just go to the blender documentation on page one and you just start reading and try all the hard case It shows and then you can do blender Learning blender is very easy people just pretend it's difficult and then they make you watch the fucking donut tutorial I Programming Programming is not something I had to learn I keep saying and people keep saying some bullshit, but I say I was really just born with the ability to program I just had to learn the grammar And the other stuffs what other stuffs I Okay the bumper Hello, st. Babsy, I'm doing well, I think All That involves what you do for 64, I guess other pieces are like game design and decision-making From game design, I just kind of made games got feedback improved on it for decision-making. I Economist book thinking fast and slow. It's very good For modeling making stuff look good. I don't think I'm the authority on this but Basically, I just made a bunch and eventually got better at it I This looks kind of nice, but it doesn't feel like this will bump me if I go into it, you know what I mean? The pin will be supposed to bump you if you go into it. Like it's just a swoop. You're like extra response This looks more like a beach ball This Also definitely does not look very bumpy And there's also these but they are already Sonic coded by just making them this color so you can already know that they Hmm I Like a physical fight You're wondering who wins in a physical fight me or like a 60 year old no, he's like what 18 by now an 80 year old man It's probably like a foot shorter than me It's not even fair. Programming and 3D modelling are piss easy. It is very easy to do something that resembles either one of those tasks, but it can be difficult to be good at those tasks. Did I have a late entry to the hot take of the year award? And that is that every philosophical question is easy to answer. People are just hiding behind the grammar to make it sound like they're interesting questions, but they really are not. Another entry to the hot take of the year award is a comment I received today that was saying that games don't need to be in 60fps. That is unnecessary now because we have AI that can draw the in-between games anyway for us. Okay, see, this is what I mean. It's hiding behind grammar and semantics, because what even is free world supposed to be? It's like the ability to do something that was not predetermined. Okay, where does this come from? Can you give an example? What do you mean? See, I don't even know what metaphysics means. Oh, this kind of looks like a bumper, I feel. Yeah, it sounds something like that, like an external thing that is not predetermined, but somehow you are doing this external thing, like, how is that meaningful? Okay, so you're asking whether there are decisions that are somehow made via mechanisms that are not part of the universe, because like, they're not part of deterministic physics. It doesn't look too bumpy. Is there maybe a conformed convolve? Oh, interesting. Answer the question with a question and I'll deduct the points. No, I need to understand the question first. I never said communication was easy. I said communication is exactly what people pretend like philosophy is, when really it's just being vague, you know? It is exactly my point. Oh, these are bumper boards. That's where I got that word from. I don't like the color of this. What if it's kind of like this, but with like lights? Lights going to the middle, more like a balloon-type sphere. Oh, that's way too high-res. Yeah, like so. And then we have a bunch of light tracks going into the middle. Nothing wrong with googling bumper boards, it's a perfectly normal thing to google. What block texture work here? Kinda. Needs to be kind of like a watermelon slice, with some light segments in between. I think it's when you ask why things are on the ground and your answer is because something beyond our reality and understanding has caused it. Uh-huh. Is it a non-definitive property? I can't believe it, I've seen results on a micro-scale. It's probably a non-definitive macro-scale, too. Hmm. But is that meaningful? Just because the decision can't be computed beforehand doesn't mean you're actually deciding anything, right? All the other courses are finished now? Yes. I don't know what win is. So I need, like, a balloon slice, basically. Um, beach ball. Maybe if I google a beach ball, I can make a texture out of this. Hey, what's sodium 6-3-1? It's an SNES emulator on N64 for random assembly. I did not know that it's very practical. What if...  Bad idea. What if... That's not what I want. What if... What if we do this and use this as a texture?  Random by Hydragon? How long does it take to emulate a SNES without running on N64? I don't know, I've never tried to emulate a SNES. I've definitely heard the name Hydragon before, though. But I forgot where. I see the original person making Lip Dragon. Name kinda checks out. Oh, a UNS emulator. I've never seen that before. That could be where Hydragon comes from. Damn, people are really out here just programming for the fun of it. Isn't that insane?  Let's make it into a fish. Is it supposed to be a bass? Is it supposed to be a bass to be shaped like a fish? Well, clearly you can if the guy programmed an N64 emulator. Yes, let's emulate on the N64. I feel like that's a soft question at that point. I feel like that's a soft question at that point. I feel like that's a soft question at that point. Do I get to ask a super question? Yes. When I'm in trouble with something or dealing with a hard day, I just think of you dog shitting on how it's actually not hard and stop whining. Awesome. Yeah, but I mean, it should still run unless the N64 emulator is not running well on N64 either. Yeah, but I mean, it should still run unless the N64 emulator is not running well on N64 either. Oh, that looks bad. What if these were like triangles moving up? Like a triangle tessellation? What's the minimum snippet I need for a proper tessellation? Probably just like this part here, right? Oh, that's pretty cool. Because I've been doing other stuff, but there's some weird cackling popping coming from my game every few seconds. That might be my chair. I might be stupid with my chair. This is in red from what I want.  The dark parts are too dark. Are you tapping your foot or something and adjusting the mic? Yeah. I am always tapping my foot. If you want, you can try zoning the things over somewhere for fun. I would never want to play a SNES game. There's not a single SNES game in this planet that I would like to play. They have to invent good SNES games first. I mean, Ireland is one I would probably like, but they made a better version of it on Game Boy. What do you have to do to become a beta test for this game? I want your firstborn child. Reasonable I'm glad we could come to an agreement I can't give people access because like if I did it via patreon or something I would basically be selling access to the game which would be really bad legally speaking it's not a snowball it's supposed to be a bumper ball like you if you go into it just bumps you up but I don't think that really works I'm not sure maybe it does it's a little ugly so I don't know if I really want this damn how do I make this pretty one issue is definitely that the lines here are just not thick enough I think this looks just so jpeg artifacted how did it happen why is this so jpeg artifact it did I'm garbage with textures holy shit this just looks so bad how do we make a sphere that looks like it pushes you away when you jump into it is it even possible no this is not supposed to be anything this is supposed to be one of those bumper balls in a pinball machine you jump into it and then pushes you very far away into the direction you came from and I feel so lost on this yeah it's all stuff like this make the triangles bigger what does that solve looks like shit give it a glow effect I can I don't think that helps they look like this in Sonic and this really does look like it pushes you away but obviously this doesn't work on a sphere right make it glow and just use it doesn't solve anything it's still awful I think this might be easy if they are not spheres but with the half spheres you don't even know what it rings and get bigger and fainter transparent yes that is definitely an effect that would work but I think the base is still awful to a point where this does not work can just be right like the whole thing is just red I think that would generally look better than this we're deleting all better idea let's try this I mean the pulsating yes that was part of it because like when you jump into it it like expands and shoots your way so pulsating is good to like visualize that so it reminds me we use any 64-bit values it does but every single time they do it looks like an accident I have an idea I have an idea all right hear me out I think this is gonna work it doesn't look good I'm gonna make it look good I think I have just gotten a good idea that will work not quite what I want please speak to me normally I have no idea what the fuck you're saying what are these words wait why do I have a dawn and dusk texture so I go with pen 64 about what what I say to make it a mid bill what a ring so you'll be of course we're gonna do that that was the plan all along but we need a decent base without a decent base hopeless so I was thinking maybe that'd be like the one star that always looks at you and it's like billboard it and then the rest just kind of goes around it I think this might work with like a transparent decal interesting the difference between these two I didn't know that's how it  I don't think this works though because the texture is not good yeah it looks too billboarded maybe it didn't look billboarded that'd be some merit to this and then if you have a second lecture above it then what would it be the flag of China I forgot what that one looks like and then use it to need the whole sprite because it's gonna look very stupid in comparison to the rest of the game it's a giant ball can't just be a sprite yeah I think transparent decal on top has potential but maybe a different texture I just don't know what I want this to look like yet I said my god is the highest ceiling activity programming not what else is more high-skilled ceiling I don't know how difficult it is to program in artificial intelligence I imagine some of the mathematical concepts required to like do that and to come up with are vastly more difficult than some optimization stuff I do that's the idea what I'm trying to do right now Fionix hello PoundsOval I could try to put like metal bars around it it could look good let's try that and it's not completely awful but it doesn't look like it bumps you no I'm not talking about enemies that behave intelligently or believably that part is not as difficult as optimization and I did say a design problem I'm talking about like actually you know neural networks and the math behind this can be more difficult saying the cool sure it looks cool but it's not what we want it doesn't look like anything that that's the thing we do does there have to be a ball? Bumpers tend to be more like flat cylinders I was thinking maybe a half circle is what it could be gyroscopic effect well it doesn't look like it bumps you the mathematical complexity would be an effect of mathematics on real programming sure but if you go that way then you can almost for everything like make up a more specific skill and say that that's the real skill here I have a discord yes I have a discord let me set the inverted chat real quick okay my discussion stretched slightly I don't think that fixes it what if we get AI to draw a concept art? I'm so out of hope I mean it kind of worked with Bert right he's like very bumpy and they kind of like the squash and stretch stuff what if we texture him like Bert the bashful from Yoshi's Island yeah AI came up with nothing that means this hasn't really been done before and then hint the players to make some bounds we're gonna have like rings around it that billboard to you would go like outwards I'm just going to make this look somewhat bumpy. I mean is that supposed to cut off the rainbow or just blue? I mean sure that would look cool but what's the point it doesn't make it more bumpy looking. Bumpy looking gameplay let's see what Google has of course it's farm simulators hmm none of this looks right is there like a spring? Symbol. I guess but also not really I mean it could kind of look like molding balls and it looks like a spring symbol I guess that could kind of work. I could just keep it as is for now and come up with the next thing because I'm out of ideas for this. Triangle piece that bumps you in the direction that it points at. All right we all know that pinball piece. You dropped it in final chat. Let's see what you did. Oh no it's not this kind of spring. This is a bumper ball that shoots you the direction you came from. So wherever you came from it shoots you exactly that way. It's not supposed to be a spring. No a spring is a separate issue. Yeah I wouldn't be struggling with it that much if it was just a spring. I just think no one's ever like did a 3d pinball machine or maybe they did. Maybe that's what it should be. 3d pinball machine. Let's see what they have. Wow. This is still 2d. Why are they calling this 3d? No I'm pretty sure people will recognize this from the ring salon. Did everyone remember Space Pinball? It's the game you play when you're a kid. Something like this would work for it. I think I should have all the pieces first and then we try to make them visually coherent because doing that before it seems hopeless. I don't think I have a vision for enough pieces to do that. I think I'm going with a half sphere for that. That would make it so much easier. I think I'm going with a half sphere instead of a full sphere. I think we should just say take the L, it's not gonna work out. Not the hemisphere, it's too common. But the non-hemisphere is just impossible. I can't do it. What am I supposed to do? It's probably common specifically because the other way around is impossible to pull these and then... Check this out. What is this? Is that a car? Oh, so you want like you have a transparent thing around it and like a static core and the transparent thing just pushes you away? That's kind of... Oh, wait, yeah. What if we do that and then we attach some springs to it? Yeah, that's a good idea. I can see a vision. I think I see a vision or I just made up what your vision is. Either way, now I have a good idea. I will implement that and then you guys will look at it and you will like it. Is this aerotech? No, no, no, no, no, no. Here's a good idea now. All right, watch this. So I don't know if this was the idea same perhaps, but this is what I was thinking after seeing that. So we've got something like this and then we're gonna connect springs to the the things here. I miss the Ice Spice concert in Fortnite. No! Wait, this conversation already happened. No, no, no, I remember this. You had this conversation with Nata. You guys were talking about whether she twerked and talking about how she didn't twerk. Did she twerk this time? She did twerk. God damn it. I have an erotic of the year award entry. I'm not into twerking. That's my hot take. Let's see, what does the spring feather look like? So like, as in you don't like twerking yourself? No, I just don't think twerking is that attractive. I just don't really get it. That's a cold take? You think so? People seem to be really into it. Because you don't like the routine? No, that's not even true. Think sexy dancing in general is cringe? Yeah! You've tried, but you don't know how? Why are you trying to twerk? What the fuck am I supposed to do with that? Dude, this strip club experience has to be so weird. You just go there to have bonus with your boys? Why do you want to have bonus with your boys? I don't understand. Or is it like a discount thing? As in like, you know, some people commute to work together? And like, a strip club is like, you get like a prostitute together? Is that the idea? So Hello, Ricardo. Interesting conversation. Yeah, it doesn't even work sour because she's going to charge premium for that. It's probably more expensive to like, get one together. So something like this is what I was thinking, maybe. And like, when you touch it, it shrinks and shoots you back out when you're modeling. But I'm still, oh fuck, I fucked this up. I broke the whole thing. Cool. Okay, but this here would be the bumper triangle. I don't like how it looks yet. This would be the bumper sphere. Basically, bumper triangle, you touch it anywhere, it shoots you in the direction this is facing. The ball here shoots in the direction you came from. And then the flipper, it's going to shoot you depending on where on the flipper you land. Bumper shroom? What's that? Shroom? I don't understand. I don't know about a mushroom. Yeah, this is kind of the idea, but we need this in 3D. Because we need to shoot you like in all directions. Do they emit light? Yeah, I'll probably make them all emit light. That was something like this before I destroyed the whole thing. Shouldn't be doing a layout of the flippers and model the parts accordingly. The flipper is going to be just flipper pieces. It's not going to be like a whole flipper machine. Basically, the conclusion I came to last time, I haven't explained it this stream, but basically, there's going to be some stuff around the main area and that will take you like all over the area with like warps basically, so you never really know where you're going to end up. We want the CFL output, but we also need it to be linear. So for that reason, we want to do it like that. And then below the main area, there's going to be the flipper pieces here. And on the flipper pieces, you can collect coins, but you can also just shoot up whenever you want and land back in the main area. So all the pieces are going to be like floating around here. And they are going to be more like disconnected pieces than a whole flipper machine. That was my idea for it. I don't like this texture here at all. Hello, Archery. Damn, now that the Ice Spice Concert is over, everyone's coming here. What the heck am I talking about, the Ice Spice Concert? Are you building? No machine. This looks like ass. Fuck Ice Spice, rude. I think I've seen Barbaric Heroes, it might have useful ideas. Yeah, we looked at that earlier. It does have a few cool ideas. But a lot of the things in it only work in 2D, I feel, like the speed stripes. I'm not sure how we would do the speed stripes here. It's basically going to the moon to find Raphael. Nope. The raven no i will bite you oh no this is the song with the one guy who has a guitar and he just goes and they forgot to forgot to tell him to shut up true you call this a banger in your left ear do you not hear that there's this guy with the guitar in your left ear and he's just going kick him out of the studio what's he doing why is he in this recording who let's him in no he can't stop for a little bit he's still in my left ear but now he's like at least playing the song okay that kind of looks like something dude he's doing it again how is no one but me hearing this so do not let the guitar cook again yeah he sucks so so i'm not 100 sure how i'm gonna program this contraction here yet um but i think visually this presents the idea it's like a neat idea i guess it's still a little ugly okay metal pieces that you can just stand on let's say mike have a popcorn i don't know what you mean by that do you mean the pop filter here do you like my new microphone it does sound a lot better if i'm close up unfortunately i cannot be this close up the whole time while i'm streaming maybe if i get a new microphone stand i can like move it here and then i would sound a lot better on stream i think unfortunately if i do that it just can't the audio is occasionally popping oh case asmr that would be a banger april first video just like assembly coding asmr so the audio popping might be because i turned on nvidia broadcast a little bit because someone at the start of the stream asked me to do this is kind of a nice metal piece i like it i'm gonna keep it so i don't know if my videos are usually relaxing i wouldn't say they are but maybe you use them to relax i i don't know i will forbid you i think these are decent enough metal pieces and the last one i have is a trampoline button piece type thing so this is actually where the trampoline idea comes in what is this unholy box that has made itself around my thing i've had the box before i hate the box so well the main purpose of my microphone is not streaming it's recording videos i do stream but it's a pretty minor part of my online presence all things considered so i'm not going to optimize for streaming so so it's weird to think that i'm technically a streamer did you guys know that streaming is harder than a 9 to 5 thought on twitter so then the other supertramp 64 i would kind of like to make one but one i don't have a fun idea and two people might get upset at me so i'm scared to make it the case the politics is serious you can't make a joke so that's why i'm scared to do it so okay wait what if i made supertramp 64 but the entire hack it was just like text boxes like breaking the fourth wall talking about how i'm going to get cancelled for the wrong pack like a true comedian so people are like oh i want my youtube slob about donald trump 64 and then what they get this just like stupid meta commentary on comedy comedians and like 90 wouldn't get it they'd be like what the fuck is this why does this guy keep talking about getting cancelled just get on with it so mike is dying uh probably because the gates to hell opened and now they're closed again that sometimes happens on the stream so is that enough only planned out i don't know what you mean by fooling but it is somewhat planned out well thanks for the end with please remember the policy on every part of public life and should not be taken lightly this hack is meant to poke fun at political scene and it's not a good depiction of my first views no you gotta you gotta be the the you're not a conservative comedian but you gotta do that one where you like talk about getting cancelled all the time that's what i was like that so possibly yeah super trump 64 returned to the white house  okay wait i have a theory you know how um animal farm is banned in some capitalist countries because it's like pro-communism and spend communist countries because it's pro-capitalism but really it's just anti-authoritarian what if we like use that concept but like in reverse like what if we made something that is pro-authoritarian to make everyone think we agree with them and get super popular is this the play okay i would have to make him say the word though Biobak if it's 2013 gamer jokes i have to make him say the word and i don't think i can do that so these angels to generate models are caught no i don't think any tools are capable of doing that at the moment  i said excuse me i need to probably go find out everything wrong with it so yeah i have a few videos up where i try to optimize code with changing pte and but changing pte is just kind of doing nonsense unfortunately i have no idea what pico card is and then delete c but produce code that doesn't really improve anything or make things worse so i had to undo exchanges so this actually needs to be like a glowing texture so i'm thinking i will replace the middle part here with something that glows sacre bleu and releasing time six hundred day would give you a free six month break from sponsors you might be right but like 90 of the sponsor requests you get is like people trying to send you viruses so it would not noticeably reduce my sponsor requests  um you know what this is a terrible texture for what i'm doing this would be much better if i made it work right aside what makes you think i don't want sponsors just because i troll every single sponsor i get wait i got the funniest sponsor request of all time just a few days ago i actually have to show this to you guys because if i don't show this you guys won't believe this so i'm going to show this to you guys i'm one of the partners of ninjas and intimately i saw your profile and think you have a great relationship with your family it's your full-time right we're deepening the connection between you and your fans by creating your own sex toy we know cloning with pussy or dildo kids are messy so we made it a hundred times easier simply by sending us pictures they want this is asking me for cock pics bro what please send us cock pics what the fuck so no it's it's a dildo not a sex toy i mean yeah it's like part of a sex toy is someone going to have your pp pic open all day in photoshop and trace it out or something in blender so that's a copy pasta you think so i mean they probably send this to a bunch of people just you know throw shit at a wall see what sticks trying to imagine a person who would do this definitely not just a random twitter user surely they're messaging like 200 people and hoping one response yes but like would they actually go through the effort to 3d model my dick and like do i have to like verify the veracity like do i need them to send me my cock to home and be like yeah yeah looks right Oh, you missed a vein there? Only one way to find out? What if okay, what if We accept we send them a picture of a cock and then we ghost them and just say yes You just looked at the cock all day and 3d model the cock for nothing So Send them the fish Set it up and then instead it's yours Very great ideas here Send them random pictures and actually they're gonna reverse image So If you shove an extra ball So So Last night my dick fell off So This kind of goes hard Speaking of going hard shout out to today's sponsor intimately So Get them to make like an n64 no holy fuck it's my brand, you know Not liable for any cuts you might get from these sharp polygons So My cock 560 Mario's cock. I mean we could totally post that they won't believe me Yeah, this is nice So What is a jam jar Oh It looks like a job jam I get it now I get it There's an idea behind this though, there's there's a point to this so the way I want this to work is um I Will look like this normally and then when you step on it goes It shoots you up When you're not on stream, okay, i'ma look at my dms So So Like whoops Full-time cocktail So Just like What if I made a video just just like every single ad request at once in one video Like a whole video that's just like 15 ads in a row Like a bunch of different sponsors Wait, what cash in so big I should just make a video named like can you beat super mario 64 with flood and it's like Just like a 16 star playthrough of mario 64 with flood but like every minute like after every star There is a whole sponsor segment Making like 20 000 on one video So How did I think about there are full-time cocktubers like right like alpha m That's a cocktuber if i've ever seen one So Speaking of super get a free month of duolingo super with my code Speaking of code get 20% your first coding lesson on brilliant I wonder if i'd ever get past screening with that So Doing completely no gameplay I I mean it's worth a try If I ever get enough sponsors to line it up like that, I will do that So Like just for the bit it would be funny no one would be upset about that, right because like it's so funny as a concept That you can't really be upset over I like that. I like the exclamation mark. We should use the exclamation mark on everything Yeah Are you sure most sponsors want to be the only one per video, I mean i'm pretty sure too but I mean, why do we care about what the sponsor wants? Think about it So Okay, you don't have to wait for sponsors no if I make that I at least want to make like 20 000 of it  That one mkbhd, who's that So Raid won't sponsor me after the one video Raid almost did sponsor me again But the way I trolled them that time they didn't like it and they didn't let me upload the video So 75 miles per hour this goes on for a car showcase video. Oh youtuber moment for sure Me when I murder children, but it's for content So I'm actually surprised how unforgiving people are to people that speed Like that's like not socially acceptable at all didn't expect that So I could make a every weird sponsor. I rejected video though Yeah, but I don't think that's what people are there for I Know I want like 50 sponsors. I need one sponsor per star Or well, I mean, yes, I would need 16 sponsors it's gonna be hard to coordinate that Such a legendary video, holy fuck 33 34 Okay, that one is fucked What's going on here, oh I picked a shitty texture that's why Come on once you've been accepted outside of like brilliant rachel just those are the only ones I've ever done That's what's an up trial back I could do it with like the full lucky to intro. I like welcome to this video today We're gonna beat super mario 64 with flood. I wonder if it's possible And then the full lucky to interplace and then oh but before we start our first sponsor and then maybe I like make it to the first tree And it's like the next sponsor Oh my god Why is gaggle in your twitch title I got on my balls Yes If we delight material you Yeah, you run it sour That's kind of sad Um Where's my ship Yeah There's my shit Honestly, it doesn't look as bad as I thought it would like against the background it kind of looks nice We gotta make this more glowy though Hmm And this one doesn't look like a flipper yet It's like a big apple Yeah I'm not 100% sold on that either the flipper and the red ball is what I don't really like the trampoline. I think is good Yeah This one can look at if you made it like very glowy Which should be possible I don't know if this object is supposed to look like a flipper This one here supposed to step on it and then it's gonna go shoot and shoot you Yeah We get bumper vibes from it, yeah It's also going to be a painter program if we go with that. So maybe we can find something that's not a painter program Doesn't look transparent it is 100% transparent it very clearly is transparent Yeah Well, the ship is unteched and unmodeled it's just an outline of a model The skybox looks so good though This level is gonna have a mario galaxy type design philosophy basically Feel open but be linear which we do by like having a bunch of random linear paths that somewhat intersect Making a z-squished half sphere on top of a cylinder kind of thing Yeah, I was thinking that too I was thinking that's a lot easier but chad really wanted me to try a sphere I think i'm probably gonna try that Um, but I think for now I will have to end the stream because I have things to do So I will see you guys in the next stream whenever that may be bye-bye
