Hello Beta, I'm gonna try streaming again. Yeah, we had a power flicker. I think someone likely hit an electric pole here. And the power was flickering for a few minutes. So I didn't want to have my PC on because it would probably take damage from that. I just made clean. No! Hello Silver. I'm so pissed, you guys have no idea. Whenever that happens, your view count just drops back to zero. And you have to farm it all the way back up. It's miserable. Hello Stonk. I was at 17. No, I was at 17 viewers. You're lying. Nice mash plays. I had days where it was like two days without power too. Now that the power is really volatile because it's all overground. So it breaks constantly, unfortunately. My restream insight said I had 56 viewers. No wait, that's stream elements. I had way more than that. 64 viewers is what it says. That's what I lost. Cool. Oh wait, this needs to be multiplied by 4. When I lived in Germany, I had to use mobile data for a while. Because normal internet was too bad to use. That's how pathetic German internet is. Well, most of the snowflakes disappeared. But there we go, my mouse is finally not zoom zooming anymore. I was planning a long stream too. Now we're going to be crippled for the whole stream. View count wise. Oh, my cloud is gone. Oh yeah, did I mention? If you guys find any funny Twitter posts that I need to reply to for clouds, you guys need to let me know. I want to experiment with this. Is there anything good where I can respond to? Definitely. Yeah, yeah, that's just how it works in vanilla. That's what happens in Mario 64 too. If you hit C while you're running, right? It's the exact same. Or am I crazy for thinking that? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, okay. I mean, as long as it's vanilla behavior, I would say it's not urgent. Right? Like two seconds, three inputs on work. Yeah. But it's vanilla behavior. So we can. It's not like I don't think so. I will literally be murdered. That is why I'm sliding or something. Yes. Which I guess if that's something you remove, people would also be upset at you for removing it. I don't see an issue with what I just did here. Yeah, I know what you mean. I guess the problem with zooming in into the camera mode before you fully stop is that the action is tied to the Mario's camera. So if you untie those, you open the floodgates for those weird bugs. I want to fix the snow and then I'll get to the zipper idea. Where were we even before it all crashed? I think we said we want the zipper to be around here. Some platforming section here. Yes, that works for sure. One time I was visiting someone to play Super Smash Bros. Melee with them, and when we all left, he played this ending song and it was perfect. It's like the best song to kick people out of your house, too. It's all RTYI and it's getting close to completion. Please stop asking me for release dates. I will literally lose my mind. That would be a great playlist. Let's see if this still crashes. It was my birthday six days ago and you didn't give me anything, Jellyfish Swimmer. I expect you to correct this oversight. It doesn't work. Interesting. Surely this isn't too big an allocation. That wouldn't make any sense. Is it too small an allocation? Bog vertices per flake seems exactly what we're doing, so this should be fine. Awesome. This is odd AI. That's beautiful. I'm so glad there exists an AI for that. That's awesome meta commentary on the state of society. I approve of this. I'm just going to make this act equivalent on both. I'm just going to make this act equivalent on both. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. This LST is a banger. I'm losing it. How can this not be right? What if I just pick a bigger number? I don't know how the AI can do that. Doesn't make any sense to me. But the S on AI, that's a good one. The investors will be happy. Hello, Alex. Welcome to bug fixing the Snowplex. So I'm just using flake count. What? Where is it? Link it to me. Flake count divided by eight, multiplied by nine. Does that make sense? Nine comments per eight flakes. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Yes, that makes sense. And then two more. That also makes sense. One, two. All right, well. On the hustle. What? All right. And. I think that's a good reply. That's for today. Today is. It would be working on course 15, but there's a bug with the snow. And then while I looked at the bug, I realized that there's a cool optimization I can do. And now I'm working on that. Okay.              Okay, this shouldn't be working. So that's good. That doesn't work. But this was not crashing, right? To tell sheltering something. Well, sheltering is extremely expensive for one. So it's. Technically. Use. Very sparingly. And we have used it in some places, actually. So it's, it's not something we haven't used. It's just that when you use it, you have to use it on small actors. Otherwise you're going to run into trouble real fast. It's not a casino. It's a space arcade. It's mini games in space. That's it. So when I hadn't aligned enough. No, when I wasn't adding, I hear it was working. Well, we shall texturing last time. My people talk to me. They just said they need multiple transparent surfaces on top of each other, which of course you can do that. Maybe my understanding of shell texturing is wrong.   You just try it. Okay. And then your time. But maybe there's always a chance you go into the level and then you just tell, see what's wrong. Funky space casino. Well, it was conceived as a space casino at some point, but then it switched to being in the case. Okay. Boots here. That's good. But there's only a few snowflakes. And then it crashes. All right. Hello. I see literally nothing wrong. I might have to check the display list itself. No. I don't want to. Please. What does the NM frame even do here? Nothing. All right. It is all happened because I moved the front buffer allocation up. What if I move it back down? Should be the exact same code. I'm glad you like, okay. I was editing. I hate editing myself. So I'm very glad I can just pay someone to do it for me. No, it still crashes. Interesting. So I must have made multiple changes. And not realized that one of the ones I made crashes the game. Now the question is, which one? Okay. That is basically the only change. I'm so confused now. Fast is not the whole change. Or something else and it'll be crashing again. That would be the worst. Man this is not a good day for modding. It wasn't even this the whole time. The tech channels just randomly start crashing again. The whole time my code worked the whole time I tried to fix my code it worked it's just something else randomly started breaking again. That sucks. Yeah yeah we'll definitely use the room system for that firework for sure. What's been going on we've been getting clashes on stream. This should work and then once that works we can go back to fixing whatever's wrong in the texture animations this time. It seems very ram sensitive because like on every x part of the level it's different. Those are the worst kind of crashes. What is this? Oh I have an object mode that's not. If you guys had to bet between blue sky and splitter which one do you think will be more popular for use in 10 years from now? So now debug and I can tell you it's crashing nope there is lost. I wish it was that simple. And I'm at 100 CPU again because there's 20 different project 64 tasks that just crash and never terminate. The worst problem is that on real n64 it legit just works. So 2014 when facebook and tumblr were all the rage. You think okay interesting theory. Yeah see on my debugger it just works it's just on the one emulator that's broken. Well I'm not confident in saying that it could suddenly work here. Well let's try that again. God damn it. What if I use project 64 now that I've xbooked again? Nope there's a crash. Cool. The problem is I can't make any sense out of it because there is no crash screen. There is it works on the other emulators it probably also works on n64. This is just a mess.  yep it works on n64 as well. Although it did crash on the other emulator after a little bit didn't it? I find it interesting how when it's at like 26 fps it doesn't really look different from 30. Like you don't just feel the difference which is very very good. That means people will definitely perceive the game to be consistently at least 30 fps. Okay wait this is... It has to be an nfp crash right? Hello Jerry. Yeah but I hate parallel launcher even more. My game doesn't even work on parallel launcher unless you have one very specific configuration and the game will get rid of that one configuration. So I won't be able to use parallel launcher. Yeah it's your fault Lufio. It's 90 percent. Yeah but it's such a bullshit emulator like how is it my fault that it doesn't work? Can't we just switch to a good emulator that doesn't fucking depend on retroarch? Or at least give me the option to pick a cpu core so we can make it not use the dogshit core crashes on my game. That would be awesome. But I actually don't... 90 percent? I don't know if that's true. But yeah it's definitely a considerable chunk we don't want to lose. Well this is clearly C code but I also use assembly sometimes. Wait maybe Namu will give us a crash message beyond what this is. I don't have a video like that outbound but I could make one. That's a decent content idea. GBI free and move forward unhanded soccer. Where else are you saying that before? Oh what is this? It still advances. You know if you use the movement card with the Glidem plugin it works. But the parallel core just crashes and Falcobuster says he wants to remove the movement card. So it won't work. And I don't think he wants to give us an option to pick which one is the default either. So let's just mess up.  what if we just force people to stop using parallel? What if we just say parallel is too inaccurate use project 64 1.6. Or real Nintendo 64. What if we force them to make parallel launcher work instead of trying to force our game around the buggy emulator. So it still crashes. Oh how how how? So what if I make this a separate function and then if it still crashes now we look at the assembly and we see if there's anything sussy in the assembly that project 64 might not like. Of course it just works now. How does changing the function from an inline to not an inline make it work? This garbage emulator man I swear. I hate emulators. I gotta see if the snowflake bug is fixed now though. The snowflake bug should not be fixed. Okay good. That's good that it's not fixed because it means that everything still makes sense.  there's one degenerate vertex forming here somehow. It's the world centered by impermanence that's true. What is it for the soul? Yeah. Moopin or parallel launchers I don't use windows anymore. As long as the other of them works I'll be able to play it when it's released. Yeah I imagine Moopin works. I haven't actually tried. I mean I have Moopin version 0.5 here. Let's see if I can pick a decent graphic plugin here. Maybe this one here. This one. Did I get the right one?  It looks like Moopin does not work. What about Moopin with Jumbo? Yeah it doesn't look like Moopin works. That's unfortunate. What if this is not enough? What if the nthfx buffer is not big enough? Oh no that looks right. That's the same code twice in a row. Hmm. It's clearly looking like it's picking up some of Mario's vertices. Which would make you think that maybe there's too much invalidated. Oh wait that could mean what if so much is invalidated and it doesn't actually get written out back to... That doesn't make any sense. What the fuck? Why is project 64 like this? So something is still bad about these. Yeah you can tell from these degenerate triangles forming here that something's not going as intended. And we're setting up all 32 of these vertices, right? Well okay now that we are actually using this emulator we can just go there and see what happens. That's a good way to find this. So just gotta wait for the next frame. Which might take a bit. Oh it's still paused. There we go. All right let's see where this is taking us. Um I need to call it open here. Yeah we should skip all this. This and then eventually... Jump table looks good. What's this job? It's 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, C. I like this playlist. It's fine we should get 0 back.  What's this job? 0, 1, F, D, 6, D, 8. Random float. That's already in... Update the particle. Cool, cool. So we're exactly where we want to be. All programming languages, if they are like reasonable, are good to learn for beginners. You don't need to worry about that. Um this is the vertex buffer allocation. I actually think that you should learn assembly first. That's like the true test of whether you're cut out to be a programmer or not. What the hell? What is this for? Why are we adding 0608 to S1? It's the vertex buffer. Oh, is that the flake count? 0x90 multiplied by 0x10 is... No, 0x60 multiplied by 0x10 is 0600. So this makes sense. This is what it should be. However, we should probably debug our memory. Open this up. So this should all fill with vertex data next. So 2610. What is going on here? Oh, those are the vertex comments. It's pre-caching those. Good compiler. Well, this is what programming is like. If you want to be a real big-boy programmer. This is checking if the game is paused. If the game is not paused, then it should pass. It did pass. And then this should be the sine function. Then the cosine, then the sine, then the cosine, then the sine. This is all the math to get the positions of the leaf vertices. And then V1 is SH. Okay, actually SH makes sense. See how I just wrote those three vertices? These are fine vertices. I guess the flag is not set, but that should not be an issue. Unless setting the flag on the vertex colors is important. But the vertex color is not part of the combiner. If I remember this... Yeah, there's no shade, just texel 1. So that should be fine. So I'm guessing they probably matched the O and U characters to save some bees. Responding to the Dota people right now. Let me see this. Checking the indices. Good theory, bro. Keep on keeping on. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 6, 7, 8. V6, 0. That's not what I had mentioned here. 6, 2, V1. V1 is 0x40. And it should be 4x8 next. It is 4x8. 5, 0. 5, 4, 6, 0. Now the vertices here should be filled. They're not. Gosh. Did I go too far? Or did it really not fill all the vertices? What is all this? Surely you didn't just write all those vertices. 1, 3, 7, 3, 6, 0. What is that?  When was S1 last used? I do S1 as 1, 0x200. That's a big number. Hello, SolarWinds. Well, actually, it kind of makes sense, right? Because it's 32 vertices, so we should be adding 0x200. But we shouldn't be adding... Should we add 8 times? No. 12 times. That's 0x... I don't know. Big number. Why is it 12 times? Why is it... It's 12 times 32 vertices, right? Yes. FlakeCount is 96. Which is also 12 times 32 vertices. But that's not what happened. But... What happened is... 0x600. Not 12 times. C by 0x200 is like... 1, 8, 0, 0? So we have like a quarter of that? We allocated a quarter of what we needed? How can this be? What's going wrong in my brain right now? We have 32 vertices... per 8 flakes. So if we take the amount of flakes we have... and we... multiply it by 4... we should have the minor amount of vertices. But here it's adding 0... 96 multiplied by 4... is... 184? Hmm. So why are we allocating... the space for 32 vertices... 8 times and getting a different number? That's... less? Are we doing it 12 times? No, that's the same number. But why are we getting completely different numbers? It's... It's like it's missing the multiply by 4 here. It is missing the multiply by 4. Okay, so that mystery is solved. That wouldn't have caused the crash though. Hmm. I think I started in 2020. I think this will still crash. Because, yeah, this is some Project64 issue that I'm not going to figure out right now. See a woofer? Considering that, that's fine. What is going on over at V1 here? Well, I should probably take a look at the return value. This is V0. This is what we're... returning? Ain't no way. Actually, no, this is fine. Load to 0B... 0008... Houses in the effect display list... Isn't this... segment 2? 2? I guess it is an effect. So we need... the effect thing loaded in this level. Do we have that? Oh, we do. We also need common 0 loaded. Do we have that? We do! Everything looks fine and I hate that. These are vertex comments, vertex comments, vertex comments... and then DE01. That looks fine to me. This looks exactly as it should. And even the vertex pointers are fine. It should be increasing by 0200, so after this there should be... F60 somewhere? And there's F60. There should be 6160 somewhere. And... 6160 is right here. So this is all exactly as it should be. Great. Which... What if this caused some kind of memory corruption somehow? And that memory corruption is causing things to break. Like the snowflakes. Okay, well, I'm glad he jumped off. Okay, I don't see any broken snowflakes anymore. So the memory corruption theory seems to hold so far. Well, if it is a memory corrupt, then it's the one that took a long time to fix. Why are Xbox controllers always so dog-shit? For some reason it keeps pressing C down. I'm not pressing C down, it's the controller doing that. Or C up. Even if I just stand here, it's like... Do I have to press C up? I don't know.   Yeah, okay, I think at this point we have very conclusive evidence that it's the styrofoam causing this. Every Xbox controller I've had so far either broke instantly or within two weeks. One time I had an Xbox controller that only had eight directions. Because I tried to buy a cheap one. See, I was thinking, okay, well, the Microsoft ones are the high-quality expensive ones, but they're dog-shit and don't work, so let's just get a cheap one. Because if it's gonna be dog-shit, it doesn't work anyway. So I just got a cheap one. And then the cheap one basically wasn't even a controller. Because it had eight directions. You know, at least the knock-off GameCube controllers have all directions. The knock-off GameCube controller I had as a kid had one of those speed-wrapped fire modes, where you press the wrong button instead of start, and it would just spam start like every frame. Let's see if the memory corruption still happens with this one. Because then we know it's the styrofoam grass. Or the normal map grass. That's an issue. Still crashes. What if we have neither? Surely it's not the palm trees. That would be ridiculous if it was the palm trees crashing. I bet there's just something dumb like I forgot to put a pointer somewhere, and now there's just a pointer going wrong. Did I ever show you guys my coins on stream? Do you guys want to see them real quick? They're beautiful. Look at them. I'm very happy with them.  I somehow have the feeling that they are improvable, but I don't know how. The blue coins I'm not 100% sold on. But they're still nice. And here's the red coins. The values for these are so sensitive. There's so many coins in Course 1. There is a lot of work behind this game. I'm going to say this is the first quadruple A N64 game ever. That's going to be the marketing. I'm going to say this is the first quadruple A N64 game ever.  Something between those. That's... Okay, I thought if anything it should be more shiny. The problem is I can't make it more shiny without the breaking. Like that's literally the most shiny I can make it before my compiler breaks down and the values overflow into weird colors that make no sense. There must be something wrong in my calculations here, right? Something where it just goes too far. There we go. I don't know. But no. Okay. What happens now? Nope. Cool. Okay, I didn't think it was that. Are we completely out of memory maybe? But it also doesn't make sense. So what's happening is that... The allocated GFX that we get are crashing. So... but that allocates at like 8013. Which is completely different from where this stuff is acting on. So there's no way that should be related. Also noteworthy, Project 64 keeps going forever. And the CPU keeps increasing forever. Do you think we should repost Trump 64 for the election? I feel like maybe everyone around the election is too sensitive to post a joke shit post like that. So probably not. The joke is played the same game I Don't even know what Kamala 64 would be she has no funny memes You know my silly ass when we treat that shit that would be instant Twitter monetization Surely it's not this I Should go assess for Halloween Sexy city escape, that's Pete. I Think that's perfect We might as well align these two things it's gonna slightly help violence and Maybe this is gonna make the output did the outcome more consistent I Just don't like true do you know what from 64 is it's like Trump us the thump and You're like Mexican Mario and you have to ground-punch him until he dies And Trump is going on about how you're paying Mexico's bills You're in case and Zeina's Nintendo with a gun That's what the clock's been it of course that matters to me You Yeah, I got no ideas this is fucked It makes again cool Wait, so when we looked at this None of the vertices were fucked but there's also the fact going on that When this happens name you takes like years to render frame and Actually in project 64 I had that happen to or two years to render frame before Like this is happening, so why is it taking so long to render this frame? And This green here How can it be green on here there's no vertex colors in the snow This has to be complete garbage data I Lost the styrofoam doing this I Think this might be better suited to Doing this upstream Just because of how complicated I should just turned out to be So For now, we're actually just gonna work on the hellhole that you can fall into So do we have a way to make a craft lava or not Stop thinking about it So right here We probably want to add a few more platforms here that you can go on you can go on and then behind here There's just a zipper you can open up There is no vertex normals on the snow and the combiner has no vertex normals enabled so that's also not possible Red wool wool is way too expensive to render although in an area like that it might be fine Mushrooms with a very easy way And marble speeds and cardboard Hulk Hulk Oh Lay out cardboard Transparent paper Good way on how to model that the great thing about the subway is that we can be really high poly and We probably will just have like floating platforms in the sky that a scissor cuts off that falls into the lava You Seen youtubers make video games I See that seems like it's very hard to sell Oh God I Did not see that I don't watch speedruns But you actually not the first to mention You Button ball wrapped around a light string Do you have like an image Keep in mind I also have to 3d model the whole thing. So it's it's gonna be an additional challenge here I Guess you didn't clean anything I Mean that that's not very realistic. But how am I gonna 3d model that? Polarity they should light up nicely using the exposed wiring at the bottom. How do I 3d model that? That is very cool though I Serendipitous aromic I Do know what a lava lamb is But keep in mind I have to 3d model it this is the difficulty The difficulty is not necessarily coming up with craft ideas. The idea is the difficult part is coming up with craft ideas that work well to Make it one make it in low poly I Think this will work to get there. You're trying to make me flame. Nope You Let plane with the texture like that that would work pretty well pretty easy to pull off I don't think it would look too good I'm still gonna need the peach to put it here It's up like this is fine for this course, I don't know I mean I'm having trouble with it Has to be too difficult Maybe not I'm gonna add a spring here just to be safe so you can use the spring if you want to And then this is what a zip is the zipper to hell I Clock so I think we're allowed to make it a bit more difficult We also got to keep in mind always that With return to Yoshi's Island, the physics are so much more consistent that everything is easier in that sense Oh My god, my stream is so far behind it's generally like two minutes how the fuck I Ideally it would make unique sounds. I don't know if we still have any sound effects left. Oh, let me check No, I don't but he like this better not be SpongeBob on the roller coaster I Take seven seconds, really? Oh, that's good. I Don't know then to difficulty is the thing that's kind of difficult to like age Like it's walking across this playing difficult for players probably for some It's gonna feel a little difficult because of how tight it is It jump like that. It's gonna feel difficult because of like how accurately you have to land I don't Yeah, I think we got that now there were some other things I wanted to do What was it There were a bunch of missing things here just like my yeah, there's two balls. I think that's missing. There's the peach that's missing there is Right those two walls up there are missing I'm glad you like the coins Right and all these tilting platforms. We're gonna make the tilting platforms tilt Let's work on the tilting platforms No, my main job is not this my main job is programming for a company I Honestly deserved Cody There's only two tilting bridges in this whole level I May not be a Nintendo death, but Nintendo show wishes death upon me I Think isn't there to optimize the maps. He's there to make them prettier and he sometimes finds some optimizations for doing it most of the time But sometimes or most of the time or a lot of the time it's a lot more different a more more expensive But he just finds optimizations along the way So it's somewhat evens out most of the time Where the hell is my thing? There we go You know what an honor of you I'm gonna call this part with neck one and cut what's neck to I Hope you enjoy your cardboard snacks It is kind of Boston but more like a finished thing then something someone is still working on So I don't wanna leave stuff around like that I Have my grandpa's nothing Thanks pointed to the wrong level You should pull it off Can answer you're looking for I don't know what your knowledge base is so I can't answer the question without explaining How Programming works from day one and I'm not going to explain how programming works from day one. I have no idea how to answer this question. I made a ci4 texture with a grayscale palette and then I also made a ci4 texture with an RGBA16 palette to read it as a normal map and then I multiply them with the camera and like that and the light direction to find minutes values and I store them back into the IA16 palette texture. Shadows previous declaration, let me see that real quick. 1608. Oh yeah. What the hell? It is. I needed a new one because my N64 was an HDMI output and the CRT couldn't take that. What do you mean the shaders are broken? What does it mean? There are no shaders. You mean they combine us? What do you mean they're broken? They all work just fine. The game boots on N64. And if it boots on N64, then everything's fine, right? And anything after that, the emulator just falls. Of course, I'm not porting it to the Game Boy Advance. That's ridiculous. I'd rather port it to PC. And then I have a PC game I can put on Steam or something. My N64 has an HDMI output. There's a mod for it called the N64 Digital. was made in planning assembly. And my new physics are on Decomp. So if I wanted to do that, I would have to port the entire game to Decomp first or the other way around. And that's way too much work. $20? $10? I'm not sure. I'll have to think about it. Do some market research, ask people how much they would be willing to pay. Get the maximum out of the function. Charge that much. I have some cards, which can, which just a program here that I can just run. It's USB connected to my PC. I'm going to go insane today. I wasn't the one that installed it. One of Zeina's friends installed it. They had the tools for it. And I didn't trust myself to not break anything. What do you guys even mean about releasing it? Won't Nintendo sue? Are you guys talking about something else? I can release the sound if I want. If I were to release this game on Steam, obviously I would have to remove all the Mario assets though. So yeah, you're right. That Nintendo would sue if I abandoned the Mario assets. Well, let's see what happens. Yeah, the good thing about this is that almost all of this is like stuff I made. And even those simple guys, they look like shy guys, but if I change the texture, you would never know. Okay, well, it's working. It's just too sensitive to reasonably walk across it. That's cool. First try. I don't know. I don't know what to call it. I can also go into red dude with white mask. Looks difficult. That's why I'm making it easier. Okay, now I made it too easy. All right, I'm gonna do this one too, so we can difficulty test both at the same time. Which Mario games have I played? I played one of them. I forgot which one. It was on the Wii or the Gamecube. It didn't get very far because I hated it. Okay, that's the answer you were looking for. Yeah, Prime sounds right. Okay, but how many players does that mod have? Obviously, if no one cares about your game, so neither will Nintendo. Okay, this is facts. I played one of those games and it was on a console. You only had three players. Well, what's the likelihood one of those three players was a developer? Is Project64 shitting at my PC again? I'm on 99% CPU. Nope, Blend is at 50% of that. Never mind. I guess we're just gonna wait patiently. Oh, the new video is not doing too well. Oh, that sucks. People are not liking this. I don't expect anything. Yeah, I expected it to do worse than normal. Just didn't expect it to be this terrible. So, that is the worst. Change the thumbnail. I have three different thumbnails. Look, I always do this. You go here, you look at the test results, and then you can see which one does the best, and it's this one here. So, it's still sad the video doesn't do well, because if it did well, then I could make more videos like that, and I have like a million possible videos like that. But oh well. Well, I'm glad you liked that, but I honestly made it for the viewers, so. It was up to me, I just wouldn't make videos at all, but then I can't do my thing as a hobby. That makes money. I just want to make games, man. Dude, it takes so long to switch files. Oh, Cosmog, interesting that you're here. Um, wait. I just ported this to my current engine, just because I wanted to see how well it runs. Look at that. Easy 30 fps on N64. Oh, that's cool. Then, I think showing you this made your mode go even harder. I was planning actually to do another video that would probably be like an hour long with all the new optimizations since the Source Code video, because since then I made the game like twice as fast again, which is why this now runs 30 fps. I made this more, like, I actually made a lot of changes to this to like make it better. Like all the little indents here I removed for the windows, so yeah. Oh, and the collision isn't really there yet. But I'm confident that even if this was fully populated with Piantas and water and everything, it would still run above 30, which I think is insane. Just like the idea of like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, that Isle Delfino can run just fine on the N64. It's almost the OG model. This one is like 12,000 triangles. But it has all the details, like the bars are here, the windows are all here, the stands are here, everything. Dude, Blender should not be this slow. Holy shit. A beach level? Which one's that? Every level in Mario Sunshine is a beach level. What are you doing? You trolling me? Cool. Yeah, obviously I didn't put in any effort on making that not good for life. I just imported it to show that it works. And whether the collision is accurate or inaccurate, that doesn't make a difference on performance. Gelato Beach. That's the one with the watermelon. Oh, that's the worst level. That's the one Mel wanted to put in a sec, right? Super Mario 8 megabytes. If that still exists. I think if I ever end up making the video with all the source code optimizations that I did in like the whole three years of development, it actually is going to be an hour long and that might be like my craziest video ever. And it genuinely is 10 times the performance of normal vanilla Mario 64 without compile optimizations. But we're leaving that part out conveniently. We're staying that part quiet. And with compile optimizations, it's like maybe seven times improvements, which is still pretty good. Dude, that will be the movie. Okay, so the collision is... Wait, what? Why is it so small? Is this the wrong model? That is the wrong model. If you hit Sunshine, why did you add Flood to the last event? Because maybe I only hit Mario Sunshine and not Flood. I never thought about that. Okay, so this thing is too fast. And that's why this is so easy to walk across. Wait, Mario Sunshine and yet you make a Mario game. Yeah, you got me. Time to pack it up. That's it. No more Mario game. Bye. Dude okay this is this is the strategy monetize don't put that you don't make twitter posts you just reply to big posts then one reply that i spent five seconds on got 7 000 views if you extrapolate this with twitter ad revenue that's like how much is that do you have to divide by like 12 000 right that's like what 50 cents bro 50 cents like we gotta do it ah wait did that just turn into a wall as i was i'm gonna i'm going crazy all right let's actually try to get along with it though okay that's cool platforming i like it that does feel good i like it and of course you can actually just like you know do that but where's the fun in that you want to balance on it can you fall off it what do you think yeah you can that's the whole point oh i kind of don't like that the more difficult version of it appears first but it needs to be like a bigger version here and it can't be a big version there so okay i still wish i could you know what do we even want the styrofoam before i spent years on like fixing the styrofoam Biobak do we even want the normal map styrofoam do we think it looks good i don't think it does i'm releasing this remake tomorrow well not this styrofoam this is of course um this is not the texture that would be used this is what the texture looks like before the math is being applied to it small part of the level somewhere not the full area i don't think it's worth it just for a small yeah i had a similar effect on the grass not the exact same but a similar one doing the fact on just the grass might be more reasonable anyway because the grass is all overhead so wait do you even know what the effect looks like for smoke because this is the effect is not in effect right now this is um just like what it looks like when the effect is inactive i had disabled the effect for a little bit because it caused a crash that i wouldn't didn't want to figure out on stream i have a video about it on the color tab on the styrofoam you can vertex color it no problem infinite bubble wrap it looks so good that's true so you can see it moving no this is this is just a flat texture with nothing on it i think it doesn't even really have what it's got right now oh i guess it has a little bit of light baked but yeah this is if you just detect this sheet of nine boats you have to pop to get a yoshi coin you're right that would be very cute i'm up for adding that to the game there's some poopy yoshi coins here anyway like this one that we were just kind of forced to put here we can't let you just put a bubble wrap there yeah okay but we need a different solution for the styrofoam then what do we do if not styrofoam my favorite mario kart wii is the mario kart wii for the nintendo wii yeah why did i even do styrofoam for this i'm trying to think about it did i just do it because i wanted to make normal maps i think so wow the last impact mindset okay but it is cool and i think as long as it's a gameplay it's fine for me to make things just because i want to this is my favorite part of the level so yeah i think it's fine if we just have it on the grass the effect is basically the same oh the question is what to replace the cardboard for added the styrofoam for painted white cardboard i don't know about that yeah let me see just walk like that he doesn't work he's just doing his idle animation hmm okay we got these though so that's that's good oh there's another tilting bridge here i gotta embark that one too and i gotta get the culling radius right because i just realized i did not please don't think i'll be able to open again can you same thing you needed with the concrete if you're coloring the iron paper luigi goes more you might want to work on your coloring skills yeah we can do that i'll add that to my to-do list here i like that that's cute all right you start from is why that start from is extremely wide when the effect is active but it still does not look good i think i mean i can't show you i just can't show you in project 64 all right let me show you this is what it looks like when the effect is active oops i got hit by the guy how do i make money doing what i do you don't if i will bro it's harsh but it's the truth you can make $20 if you submit to simple ships for making competition actually never mind you can make $20 it's pretty easy to make $20 there the final game will take up pretty much exactly 64 megabytes and you know sometimes this just happens and i have no explanation is there any cotton wool in the stomach yet that would fit the theme but it would look more like clouds than snow um no there isn't but how do you make cotton wool without it being insane expensive on the n64 i don't know if the effect is after or not you should be able to tell by the color sheets of paper stapled to the ground as in like staples to cardboard i mean that would work yeah so we would remove the beveled edges too so like white paper are you thinking like an actual stack of white paper like this it seems difficult to convey so the normal map grass should not crash right currently staple the stack of paper yeah so just a single stack or a single sheet stapled to each side of the cardboard yeah i think the normal map grass looks a lot better though than the other one oh how does changing the grass change this that really shouldn't happen um that must be what the spark is about oh wait actually the other one still runs right yeah okay yeah i wanted the grass to kind of look like wool and i wasn't sure how to do wool but i know i needed somewhat realistic looking reflections so i made it so that depending on how you look at the wool i don't think it's recognizable enough as moldo so i don't know do what is this let's see how this is 168 by 180 times two yeah that looks like shit wait this is kind of raw i agree 16 to 9 well on the 16 to 9 you could scratch it right like anamorphic white screen i don't know if you've seen this but right i'll show you on my n64 so you know what i'm doing before you say anything is junior doing good right i have a toggle here so if you're on a white screen tv uh you can just turn this on and you actually get a bigger field of view you see that so that would actually work out and then um yeah i hate this because now you can't really see to the side it's i really like my field of view one two three sixteen to nine also bra but a little less bra if she's a zoom video to fill up the whole screen no i don't like the resolution i still prefer this this is very close to 16 to 9 right do wrong opinion but i can't accept defeat i just prefer the bigger field of view how does my card look like in multiplayer why yeah marika also doesn't like this and i think i'm allowed to cut off a little bit on the side if it means you go from 20 fps to 30 fps i i think that's fair the 10 fps is more valuable than a few pixels on the side also yeah that would be the other problem with your proposal the fact that you know you're on a full 43 i don't know what that means do you mean stretch all right i'm gonna make a note um replace styrofoam with cardboard and paper staple what are you doing today miserable what else is missing the peach doodle did lera ever sent us a peach to don't know and we need a bowser noodle that shoots flame to you underneath each column of pixels oh god that's what the old multiplayer did by the way it did just flicker between both screens really fast and then i just rendered at 60 fps which made both screens render at 30 fps each it's not the most optimal way of handling it because this way you have to do the entire mat stack twice for both players instead of doing it once for both together it also meant that one player had half a frame of input like more oh no the epileptic wouldn't be an issue because it would still be at 30 fps right you just wouldn't see the frame advance every other vi right so we want the zipper here to go to hell okay actually this is a huge thing for me the floor looks really bad we need to do something about it i actually want to raise everything up a little bit too so it's like this side but yeah i don't like this floor at all it's also really performance intensive we can take a look on this on the n64 real quick so you guys see the issue too we don't want it to feel like it's just arbitrarily floating in the sky yeah this is the worst performing level by far right now which to be fair every new level is becomes the worst performing level ever just like i make the other levels with the old budget in mind and then i just increase the budget by making the game run better and by the way uh do not make fun of my gameplay i'm playing with like two seconds of input like all right i will cry if you do you have the new font yeah it's very fitting it's um just like mario 64's font but upgraded what's the intention we use rgba 32 textures which can have an alpha channel so that way you can kind of alias detectors or anti-alias i probably also want to play with dude you see the difference between anti-aliasing off and on i prefer on like by a lot but i hate the dither Well, the trick is that I just know what will happen most of the time, because I'm that good at Mario. But if I want to do a triple jump, I have to input the triple jump before Mario even did the second jump on my screen. Which is a little crazy. One issue about the snow being just paper stapled to this is going to be that Luigi's paper is going to look less... Anti-aliasing is like a 15% performance drop, I would say. Right now we have 23 FPS, anti-aliasing off. 26. So, okay. We do want this to be like the flying paper scene. But an ocean made out of whatever the fuck I put on the bottom just doesn't look right. We can't have that. I do like the mountains, I don't like anything else. We can just have the white void if we want. And have everything fade to white. But I'm also not sold on that. We can have it be table colored and then be like, yep, this is all placed on a table and if you fall down you die. But that also is ugly. Oh, by the way, I just got a week of work, so I will probably be streaming a lot the next week. Leftovers could be good. Maybe two or three from above. Yeah, I also really want to prevent the player thinking that they can jump down and see something down there. That's one of my big worries, right? We wouldn't want the player to just jump to their own death. Did you know that if you're mipmapping, it costs a shit ton of performance because it really limits your combiners? But yes, I have added mipmaps in some places, like the Mario Bros. retro section. Hmm. What do people put their cardboard dioramas on usually? Maybe maybe that gives us some inspiration. The White Void. The Gray Void. The White Void. The problem I have with the ocean is that it's very performance insensitive and it's not really recognizable. I got a lot of questions about what even it is. But I also need to kind of pull everything up. And then I need to cut holes into everything. Because like right now there's so much overdrawing, which is why the game runs at 20 FPS in the    first level. Hmm. I should also make it end before the mountains. Table is the obvious answer, but table has no contrast with the rest of the level. So the level doesn't really look like level if I do that. Or the table doesn't really look like death void if I do that. Right, this way at least it kind of stands against the floor. Some good old clouds at the bottom. That makes it even more expensive. We already have clouds here too. I don't know if you ever saw this, but look at this. We're actually in a room. And there's a lamp here. Yeah, it's like a toad house. You know what my favorite thing is in this level? These mushrooms here that are just an inverted plate with a toilet roll. So fitting. Right, what else do people put that a carp on by Ramason? A carpet. Hmm. Oh, I see.     So what does just look like the blue void for like most of this and then around there would be a darker blue and then a really dark blue. So I'm following you with its eyes. Yeah, of course. Look at them. But not just that the ice of inertia. Show by themselves to. Look, they're googly eyes. They fall down and then when he falls. They go up. And they bounce to. I think I like that idea by a bike that looks very good. Should go crazy when he hits the ground. I can look into that real quick. Can definitely increase the googlyness. But also the scourge. You mentioned if I used variable names, I would be unstoppable. Okay, so we can make them go crazy. Yeah, by doing something like this. And increasing the I guarantee me. Is that closer to what you're thinking? Can you even look at me anymore? Because there is so much gravity on his eyes. Hard for him to look at me. Why is he trying to look at me? Here. Okay, now it works. There you go. All right. I like the idea you posted, though. I would give that a try. Thinking this. Oh. I mean. I'm thinking about the options right now for how to make that happen. Definitely is somehow possible, but damn, do I really have to? And so I should edit these mountains to the point where. There's no more like stuff behind them. Should allow me to cut the background material earlier. I really don't need this many mountain pieces. Okay. All right. We had the glue here. These are film. As you have required for them, you'd think, but they have a decal on them. So this is the decal. At least until I remove the decal, which maybe I should just for performance reasons. The ice castle is not finished because I still wanted to make a piece of it, but she just never did. So it's a bit awkward. Each area of the stage. What does that mean? No. I thought about the question and the conclusion is no. There's many areas that are not a stage that are just a part of the stage. Okay. Okay.  The question is if this is going to run better or not, and then after that, we can still do the cuts that Biobak suggested. How many triangles are the clouds here? Go away. Error message. Please. The whole thing is just a thousand two hundred. Dude, the fucking error message. I can't read the triangle notes. Why is there so many error messages in this version of us? Okay. Okay. Somehow this is six thousand triangles, which seems a little excessive. Thousand two hundred on there, which doesn't seem very reasonable. Four hundred here. Where is like my. Is it this? Two hundred. Four hundred. The fences. Error message. I can't read it.  How? How is there five thousand triangles here? I must have done something stupid, right? That's only nine hundred. I feel like somewhere there have to be a bunch of hidden polygons. Wow. It's exported. Look at that. Sixty four. Maybe it's fine. Okay. Yuck. Doesn't seem better at all. What does my performance meter even say here? Yeah, it's all RDP. Forty millisecond RDP. My game thread is like twelve milliseconds. Computing this whole thing takes twelve milliseconds, but then rendering takes forty. Wait, that's not even the new level model. What happened? What happens? I've recently been playing Twilight Princess with my wife. And there are a lot of things where it looks like they just kind of said, fuck it, go ship it. Yeah, that's a lot higher frame rate already. And of course there's a few issues. Oh. I guess it's a higher frame rate because of the window, right? But still, this is a big improvement. Not bad. Plus we can render that without Z-Buffer too. And just put it below everything. And the whole cardboard area, well, the whole Star Reform area will be less with the stapled ones. Because we won't have these bad glitches. Yeah, I think it will be fine. I think that was a good idea by Biobak. Plus, keep in mind we have an optimized level. I'm just a little bit so far away. The snowflakes aren't expensive. Like I said, the whole frame costs 12 milliseconds to compute. It's the RDP time that's expensive here. That's the only thing we're worried about. Yes, cardboard Luigi talks. I might actually go even further and cut out all these individual shapes. Like here below this, I'm going to cut a big hole. But that would be something for the final touches and not right now. And then, of course, we're going to go with Biobak's idea to... Where is this? Where was the image? To do this, we're going to put smooth edges around the rim. What the hell is going on there? Right, I know why. I'm going to put two edges like here and it's going to be bright, darker, and then darkest. Also, these mountains here really need their own material. They are crying for their own material with the snow. Because this is like overdrawing twice. Yeah, once I fix that, that's also a huge FPS boost. But I think I've had enough for now. This was a long enough stream. So I will see you guys in the next stream, which will likely be tomorrow. Bye!
