you you hello hello i'll say hello Golden Glitch hello Sarah yes i remember you you updated the comment i don't believe that a text explanation is ever going to explain this oh if you have an example model that's even better then i can actually take a look oh well if you can't send it then i think we're just out of luck you you i made the crash screen for less than four megabytes for less than eight megabytes of RAM work again so we still need a graphic for it but basically when you try to play to play this game with less than eight megabytes of RAM you get a screen like this there are in need of water and drink some water sorry you're not an idiot shouldn't have said that i mean you might be an idiot but i don't have proof of that you okay so i think we're going to make the baby yoshi control the warping behavior here maybe not the expansion pack is required this is not because the game actually needs it and wouldn't run without it it's because making it run without it would be too much okay more work than i want to do you here i think i'm recreating an important marxian modern game like unreal and unity while trying to keep the original galaxy as much as possible it would be fairly easy for me to create this an unreal engine this is what pc ports should do pc ports should just take mario 64 and put it on the unreal engine like what else would be the point of a pc port huh maybe then there'd be a reason to mod it because you want like unreal engine features i think i could do it in six months the whole game in unreal engine well the whole game minus glitches i wouldn't really make the glitches from the original game that's basically impossible oh nice marty an option for a 480i output nope you you know unreal engine is complete dogshit i agree and i say this as someone who has been programming an unreal engine for two or three years now i forgot when i started making oh you hello victor eduardo hello judy do you prefer coding or graphics or composition coding uh i don't think lmmllms are any useful right now for n64 coding and the problem is even if they were useful i wouldn't really be able to use them because people would get mad at me you you you hello no vikando you you you been yesterday myself like three hours on tiny 3d with chad gpt what what does that mean i tried to get chad gpt to generate your code that is functional by 3d you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you how is that 7 000 coordinates seven hundreds you did you come on because i wanted to make 60 fps today but doesn't quite mean because it doesn't have textures okay great you no one's doing i wouldn't sell to anyone what they're both scams i have not been contacted by and i don't know no i was never much into machinima the whole haha random humor is just not for me you you yo biobank meow meow biobank did you uh sign the thing you gotta get back to me so i think stuff is coming back from what i've seen had textures so i thought you just sent push to the wrong record something no no no it was intentional to do that armatari was the name i don't know what the other name was from the sg4 characters they also made the pomni show right the digital circus i think i watched like five episodes of that it's crazy how successful they've gotten it's kind of cool you and we're signing bio back here at case industries well it'll be public once you release r2i i can't be public i don't care you can't see me i keep making this mistake just because i'm so used to this i did a lot of weak factors recently and now velocity and position is just a vector any ost wishes for today nintendo cat music i got it meow meow meow meow meow meow that's a real game it's not real this is not real it's not meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow play that note block nicely how much you are learning about program and being quite lost with me learning something i think any sort of future i'll be bigger i mean i guess it makes sense to learn how to learn but i'll be honest i never spent any time learning programming it just kind of happened like it'd be dishonest for me to tell you some inspirational stuff about doya just do these things and you learn it it's like no it's just what's there meow meow meow meow meow glad to see i picked up the Eva i want both times i guess that's just inherent that's good for consistency that's true i guess memes are evolving faster than ever but also they are no longer dating as fast how can this be do you think there will be like people in 2031 going six seven meow meow meow meow meow you asshole meow meow meow meow the noise was used as torture to extract confidence are you implying the nazis only confessed to war crimes because they were being tortured i don't know if this is what you should be doing i feel like there's literally laws against what you just did hello tea time you're gonna think this is fucked up but when big chungus dropped the reddit army they were like 100 into it they were loving it it only became ironic after the reddit army started making serious big chungus jokes he says i'd rather switch with you but you don't know how hard it is to fire doesn't fly up the way we want it to also it should take a little longer he speaks with his eyes closed and even though you're not alone he's never there to be with you and you remember when you were young well i was new and it was what is this how did how is this playing i've put in nintendo cat music the s and we era frutiger arrow let's do this i think that there are laws to make sure nobody says wrong things yeah me too you remember the bitcoin nope it's still more divisive than trump or politics i don't know which thumbnail one which one are you guys getting are you getting the politics thumbnail are you getting the more divisive than trump thumbnail you got trump hello golden glitch mkds that video did so well i should just put bullshit in the thumbnail more often i should just put the i promise this is interesting in the thumbnail my youtube channel is from now on going to be social commentary about the state of youtube yeah it is random and then it just picks the one that's better thank you for the two u.s stars happy birthday can this run on nintendo it can okay so for some reason doing this is not moving mario i guess what's happening is reading npc dialogue is updating mario's position to the floor they share a concept okay how about then there is the action state and now mario should be taken into the sky it definitely would have done numbers you're actually an ironic right i just realized my mistake and make microsoft copilot for n64 i'm sure it's possible but it's not gonna be very good no it's not my birthday oh why does it not move mario oh i moved these two whoops that was dumb okay bizarre things are happening it moves mario but not this i guess we do need to automate the goal surely now it works yeah my birthday is the 20th of october hey there we go mario is moving up with the ship oh ah this is so nice that you can just do this now the rta repository is so much better than mars is pretty common when asked before but has nintendo given you any flag for this game no they have not see whenever i upload anything about this on youtube there's like 200 comments that are like oh you're gonna get dmca this is gonna happen any day now you're so dead you're gonna be the in-depth nintendo is gonna shoot the homeless b-man you and put you in prison and then it's like they don't actually do anything the fish looks nice what fish how do you know about my fish is anything in the list option even work on projects nope it doesn't emulate those yeah does mario enter public domain do we need to wait for our device release until then so i've seen star flower opening but it doesn't work we're just gonna make a new cutscene for this so i've seen what can i copy this part here oh my god i love my system so much this is so good so look at this we can just set the desired angles and stuff but we want we probably want just above 80 degrees and 180 degrees so like this we want relatively yeah it should be good so look how easy it is to add a new cutscene oops just a moment literally all we had to do was just this then just for the last part we do this and we're all done fans love telling you how your fan project that they love is going to get you killed and you should just give up that's true there's even that one video that everyone cites where it's like the shut the fuck up video i i gotta tell the guy who made that video to shut the fuck up i want to talk to him he needs he needs to learn to shut the fuck up about things he has no idea about it's not learned helplessness this is imagined helplessness you know what happens what what actually happens is there's 100 rom hackers they start working on 100 rom hacks 90% of them were going to give up before they get to the end anyway and they they they they start working on it and then half of them give up and maybe at some point like a rogue company takes down a single media file upload somewhere and it's not even nintendo it's going to be nin brando or something and their website just links to some bullshit with a bunch of viruses and then they're like oh nintendo took us down well i guess i guess we have to stop developing the game now such a shame we were going to finish it but nin brando just took down my game i guess uh it's not my fault guys don't be mad at me be mad at nin brando that's what's happening and then these fucking idiots are in every youtube comment section be like but nin brando took it down man you you can't you have to be careful the nin brando threat is real but it's it's true most of the takedowns are not from nintendo they're from people impersonating nintendo okay that's almost what we want i think the pitch is a lot too high i think we actually want a pitch that slowly goes down like this so nintendo is going to take down the game now i think they still run at 30 fps i think they ended the game at 16 fps that's true well actually most nintendo games did run at 30 fps that's for real my cover and sound like terrorism well there's a lot of people just making shit up i guess oh wrong exit demo and the ship is going to move with him okay so it looks different from what i should actually be looking at right now okay something like that i think we could go with a little more distance um it could be a little lower the angles could be also a little lower maybe i have to worry about the answer screen getting too warm and running like no oh see one thing i really want to do is program a thermometer for the n64 just for the fun of it i think this cutscene looks mostly good the yoshi ship should probably like move up slower overall like what if the yoshi ship did this and it moved up and then slowly the angle went further and further down i think that would work yeah like a thermometer you profile the n64 cpu processes and then based on how fast each process is you can determine temperature from that because n64s do run slightly differently at different room temperatures which is a fucked up thing to say by itself but it is what it is so no i don't have to worry about the n64 or anything at least i never worried about it but i also never played my n64 game for very very long on a hardware like that okay there we go this is the cutscene to enter um let's turn this to 400 just for a test see if the yoshi talks to you the way he's supposed to eventually because you're asking but you put the answer next to me then oh that's so cool actually wait what if we do that is that how terrorism works that's how people claim to represent an omnipotent entity and you ought to do what they say oh terrorism let's move it oh i see maybe not enough power get more stars okay that works so so it's very very big stunt stuff and it's kind of annoying because like oh no making this project but be careful and then don't take it down yeah it's i sometimes get people like joining the discord and having a mental breakdown about the fact that i publicly developed the game they're like please case please please you need to develop this game in secret i don't want you to go homeless nintendo is going to find your game and make you go homeless that's actually like the exact wording to do they're like yes nintendo can just pick out a person even though they're not doing anything legally wrong and make them go homeless which is the most insane thing in the world to me how are you gonna make me go homeless please how does that work you need to create the maverick to turn on the music before playing true okay make two or three Yoshi's that don't spawn until Bowser 2 is beaten yes we're gonna do that but that's for later there needs to be an open world next to the super happy 3D worlds right honestly i think the boss fight just has to be in an alternate version of this where we copy this like what if this area is just also part of the last bowser level but all the trees are going to be wilted and the melons are not there anymore and there's a hole in the ground and like everything is burning i think that's the way it should go the arena needs to be unleavable maybe thorn bushes that spawn around well that's also for the end the way to the airship and the way to the super happy tree that's also for the end i'm actually gonna remove all of this thing here can i i think that's all the trees and watermelon is awesome i'm sure that's not that easy either need a fruit juice bar that's for zaynor to make i will just leave the houses like this for now in the metal garden there's a god and a yoshi at some scatterground a bunch of shy guys attack and you have to save them from getting spiked by them if you love watermelons so much what do you think of the mission in mario sunshine with the watermelons bro knows what kerosene tastes like guys opinions on storing a toothbrush in the bathroom while you guys respond to that let me think about what to do for this mission so i was thinking there'd be a yoshi here he's a gardener and he gardens and eventually a bunch of shy guys with spears appear and he says my garden has been infiltrated i'm gonna steal my melons can you help me and you need to go through here and find all the shy guys and like kill them all like reducing poop for bacteria resistance start in toilet go directly to the source sunshine watermelon mission isn't even that bad unpopular opinion counterpoint the gameplay itself maybe if it isn't that bad you have to look at the mario sunshine bridge i think mythbusters busted that already busted what storing your toothbrush in the poop machine or like like they busted the fact that you should be able to do that or they busted the fact that this is a bad thing to do oh yeah these watermelons are like 20 triangles each they're awesome poop machine yeah me when i'm in the toilet i'm the poop machine and big blue yoshi oh no they want my melons i'm going to come and grab my melons please mario you have to protect my huge juicy melons that is true rare would do that the amount of fecal matter on the toothbrush in the bathroom any other room is about the same unfortunately they showed the opposite they showed that there is a lot of fecal matter on the bathroom toothbrush so unfortunately you remembered the myth exactly wrong okay i think we're going with that idea it's just a yoshi here and he's upset that his melons are being invaded why are they not round how many triangles would you like me to add god damn you guys think this is actually just too pointy i mean that triples the triangle counts it's technically doable but bang that's so many triangles kind of look pointy as fuck god damn it so it might be good yeah to be fair i did copy them from something that's very very small so it wouldn't be that obvious in the small one it's okay we will leave it like this for now and then buy it back and decide what to do with it later how does that sound sounds good to me should they be just those japanese square watermelons that'd be a great excuse our sunshine did have square watermelons but they were beveled so they don't look that that's query i guess is it current music yes and we are a fruity guy so i've got to get some rgbs what rgb do we get them do it's too light 85 stars for this this will be a late game mission thank you mr merengue they showed that it didn't matter what room all of them had bacteria right but i mean maybe fucking youtube lied to me because i saw this on a short and you can easily edit the shorts to like fucking lie but it definitely said and i saw this this morning that there's way more e coli on the ones that are in the bathroom but maybe youtube just lied and they just cut it like that what color do we give him he is a melon farming yoshi i feel like he should contrast with the melons a little bit i feel like bilou do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

do do do do do do do do do do Wii Sports-ass music. No, this one's explicitly evil, not just shy. Mario Kart Wii. You can hear the screen right now? Nice. Wii Sports-ass music. I think this is not working, because of the space in there. Interesting. Yeah, bad idea. And then we delete all this. We rename this, and then we re-export all that. Wii Sports-ass music. Just make sure I got the order right. Wii Sports-ass music. We finish that. We're now doing the next mission, which is the secret star in the overworld. Well, it's not very secret, it's like an event that happens. Yoshimi, Yoshimi! Wii Sports-ass music. Damn, that Yoshi's not looking very panicked. But the Shy Guys are here, and that's the important part. It might be a few too many Shy Guys to beat. I imagine this would be annoying to do. Well, I want something cool for the arrow screen. You kind of have your creative freedom here. My only recommendation is that it has the exact arrow message that Nintendo needs developers to have. Ah, pushing that doesn't work anymore. Interesting. Wii Sports-ass music. This would be less annoying to do if the collision was working correctly. Wii Sports-ass music. Nintendo did not require the message to say 8 megabytes of RAM, no. The arrow message I put there is wrong. Wii Sports-ass music. That's the exact writing that they need you to have in the RTYI channel. Maybe a gimmick to this fight at least? Yeah, something about the fight just isn't fun at all right now. I was thinking the gimmick would be that you have to fight the Shy Guys in here. Wii Sports-ass music. I think we have that keytone. Wii Sports-ass music. Wii Sports-ass music. Wii Sports-ass music. Wii Sports-ass music. Wii Sports-ass music. Wii Sports-ass music. Yeah, if there's only one melon left and you have a wave-shotting guy coming in and you need to defend the lawn survival for a while. That would be very cool, but then I need to make all the melon's dynamic objects, which I guess I can do. Yes, it's possible. Wii Sports-ass music. Oh no, at that point I just made all the melon's one object. Oh, I have different objects. I like melon defense too, and that's the problem. Wii Sports-ass music. So I guess what we would do is we remove all the melons on that act only, or once the mission starts only, except for one. The melon is there, and Yoshi has the pop-up text that says help, with a large pawling distance, way bigger than what I have right now. Let's double this. And then, after you talk to him, maybe like a cutscene plays of Shy Guys approaching. Let me just think about how the Shy Guys would act. Because it definitely would be a lot more fun to fight them with not all these melons in the way. I guess they wouldn't come all from the same direction, they would be from different directions. Wii Sports-ass music. What happens when they touch them? Does it just fade out and you lose? Wii Sports-ass music. We can absolutely make the melons grow, depending on star count. That's actually the coolest idea for what to do with them. Right, there are more objects. Wii Sports-ass music. Let's make this mission through melon defense. I like melon defense. The Shy Guys come running out of here, at the other side with their spears. They detect these holes and jump over them, and they run at the melon. They run, run, run, run, run, run. Maybe they have like a random arc to their run. Yes, these Shy Guys do not swim. They don't like swimming. Wii Sports-ass music. So you talk to the Yoshi, you see a cutscene of the Shy Guys running into the melon. You have to go to the melon and defend it. I think the Shy Guys should all be coming from the same direction, honestly. All from this direction, maybe. Wii Sports-ass music. And then we can put the Shy Guy on the entire opposite end here. We can make the mission about attacking the Shy Guy system come in. Maybe it's like this melon that stays. And then... We can just cap the door and it's not fun. Well, they would have to have like big radiuses they move in. I would have to give them like randomized paths. Like they would... Some would like spawn here and jump over. Others would spawn here and jump over. And then they could be like going this way. Or they could go both ways. What if the Shy Guy is trying to carry the melon away? What is this? Yeah, yeah, so four different... You have four different sides in mind. Okay, well, we don't have four entrances. We can only really do two. From bushes that they jump out of. Oh... What's so bad about just having two entrances, though? You just have two entrances and they can go like randomish paths. There isn't really anything you can camp. They do lower their spears when they dash towards you. 1.5 defied? Not quite, come on. If they take like curves to go around, I think you're fine. I don't think it will be a problem. So making the melon an object, I think that's like 100% guaranteed. We do that and we actually make the melons grow throughout the game. We can have each melon give a random scale and then we add an additional scale depending on the star counts. And that will make all the melons grow and that will look very cool. That adds a lot to how the world feels alive, in my opinion. The one problem I have remaining with this is what happens when they touch the watermelon. Do you just lose? Do we just fade Mario out and place him back in front of the Yoshi and you have to redo? I think that's the best way to do it. Yeah. Oh nice. Melon field will be empty except for one melon. There's more to your answer. I think Mario is still out. Talking to the Yoshi starts the cutscene of the guy guys coming in from the sides of the melon. I don't think you would get anything. It's more like an easter egg that you maybe find. If you really want, you can make a side level for me maybe. Because there's a bunch of side levels that we have to do that I don't want to make. Yeah. I'm not making more Shy Guy variants. I just want to make the mission. Guys, let's not add unnecessary complications. Make a what? A side level. See, I need a lot of side levels in this game. And it's going to be a lot of work. And the more work other people can do, the better. This song is muted. I don't know why. Side level, yes. Like the small level of one star. There's actually a ton of side levels that I still need. If you would look. We have Marty's Creek Garden, this one's pretty much done. We have the Windflower Slides, this one is done. We have a Golf Mario side level, where you like play golf in the sky. Golf is via cannons. Rising Lava side level, a Yacht level, the Conspiracy Theory Yoshi's House, an Oil Tanker, something based on Adrenaline you already have that. Manta Ray Surfing, a Wing Cap based level, Cloud Cap level, the Yoshi Race Stadium, Shy Guy Seeks, Rolling on Pinball, the Pepperfruit based level maybe, Shell Dive, Race Against a Shark, and the Planetary Gravity level. Now not all of these are guaranteed to be in the game, but these are ideas we have. Yes, so we might have to just go and like change the art style if it looks too different. I think the Eiza Windmill Flower Slide is not really a flashy art style at all. And I think it's because I updated a lot of the shaders. Not this one. Not this one. This one here? The art style of this feels very fitting to RTYI in my opinion. And it's probably because I made a lot of the shaders here. What do you think? I agree though the art style on Marty's level is a fair bit different from the rest of the game. But I do agree that for future levels you probably have to reel it in a little bit. Yeah, it's made like half by Eiza and half by me. Eiza like did a lot of the assets here and I did the finishing touch. Does not have any quality up to here. Most of them we saw are quite high quality. If they are not the quality we need, then obviously we will polish them up. Made Ghost Story 64 with its level on the screen look good enough. Let me see Ghost Story 64. This is not polished enough graphic wise. But I think we can do a lot of fixing just by getting better shaders. But something like this is just... It's not smooth, you know what I mean? There's seams all over the place. That's not something we would be able to do, unfortunately. I think Eiza's level looks more different from the rest of the game than Marty's does. Really? That's very surprising to me. No, Harland, this is not a democracy. I do define a decision. I don't even want to give you the illusion of choice. Your only method of influencing the voting results or the results is by influencing my opinion. Do you have like a video of it, Sonny? Then I can take a look. Anyway, let's take this melon here and separate it into something. I can't tell if it's the one that's not tilted. I appreciate the sentiment and it is great that you want to make a guest level. But obviously I have to make sure that they do fit the graphical quality in a way. But even then, even if you can't produce something that's the same quality, you could still try and then maybe we can salvage some of it to make the level or maybe we can update it. A lot of it is not just actually making the graphics, it's also making the ideas and stuff. Hello, Clement. Oh nice, this is a good watermelon. Okay, since we are making this a separate actor, we have the chance to add more triangles. Why are there triangles at the bottom of its covered leaves? It's not that covered, I guess. It runs on PlayStation 1. It's not enough... ...to make it special. Oh, right. The narutomall Cosplay one but... ...this one's dedicated to Naruto. world let's just say we're not going to be following the same rules anymore, Sonya... Okay, how is this for all whats going on..?? ..Right now?!?! Who's going to complain now?! ... That's what you get for hating on my watermelon, you get a nicer looking one. Too tall?! I guess I can kinda see it... ... Cute... But... I don't wanna... ... I don't wanna have to make a striped Yoshi, too... We're actually running out of memory here at some point. We might by just to add a third level to store more data... Maybe we should make each overworld part its own separate level? Maybe that would make sense. Cause then the amount of data you'd have to load is not as much, but then there'd be so many duplicates of a lot of actors... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
