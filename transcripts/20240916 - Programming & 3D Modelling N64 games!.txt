You  Hello hello minus Mario bonus bonus bonus Hello x-links Hello paper kitty hello sites I'm kind of scared how fast you guys were in here Hello author Hello in Japanese sky Hello again a turn I'm streaming on workdays dummies. No, you're not trying to work. Then you know it Hello, Sarah So I tried to kind of map out how I want this level to be laid out This is an interesting effect cool Yeah, obviously that needs condition removed otherwise you can't go up here I I think I'm link, but I'm soon back to work. So I'm gonna be able to stream a lot less Case you you're are unemployed false. I'm self-employed for one Oh Make the trees blue. Nope How is she talking in VC does he know I could literally kill him Oh Yes, so we need to think about how this would work platforming wise like where the pass would be and stuff like that Are you guys actually hanging out in VC? Oh, it's you and pyro So The spawn point being here I kind of like it although there's a lot of like like we don't want this here right in the start, I think So I definitely want one platforming section to be like up here and then over here Then I want one to be here here here here One path over here and then from here over here And there will be a paper airplane here to get to this island here which is the bit pipe No, this is a mix of test and layout Basically right now I'm thinking about how this will all work out in gameplay And I'm thinking about whether we need to move big elements so that we can fill in the gaps And Any OSC wishes for today Right, so I have this section here which is like what even is the point of this That doesn't seem to be any point to this So I should probably remove that. Also, what do you think of the lighting? This is auto-generated lighting from a spotlight a point light Sticker star was T fine This is both on YouTube and on twitch I'm multi streaming I So I kind of don't like that from here you always go forward so there should be a way to go this way as well And to go up here. I Wonder if I shouldn't mark the paths somehow. I feel like I should It's there a good way to mark paths like that And It doesn't really work anyone have an idea Like the first initial path that needs to be ready each time. Yep, true That's what I'm also not liking about this which is why I said I want a path over here And then maybe a path over here and maybe I'm gonna move to spawn. I Can still move to spawn here or something hello skyloft So There does look like it's gonna end up being very linear no, no, no This is very similar to the layout in peaches fury and that one was really not linear Because I want more money sour og And I use I can use an armature to do this. That's a genius idea So, let's say we move to starting location here And  Yo, what was that? Give me like 10 seconds and then I know what just happened Rocco. Thank you for the $11. Holy shit No, even at GFB, I'm technically a self-employed contractor I Say for the donation button, that's amazing So what I'm doing right here is trying to draw the paths that you can take throughout the level So we can have an idea of what this level will play like That Feels like a good idea to me. So I want the path here as well I Just thought of using the ones like this And So there's like two main paths off to start This is a main level Mika We're thinking convention, I mean, I would hope he can bench 210 pounds if not, he would be really weak I Can bench myself one and a half times I Yeah, so I don't think this is good I Don't like this This is all too linear and obvious It should be a path from here to go like over there or something and then from here I want something going over here and up here That would be a lot cooler As of bonds, these are the paths that you can walk I'm just drawing them in so I get an idea for how the level will play Cannon cannons are cool You Guys who is the strongest enemy character and wondering forever? You Know lava came on after my 64 things it was lifetime. So no reference to that. That's my rule It's OC Maybe there should be another path from here over here. I think that would add a lot So Does each path of a purpose This place might be distracted like this way around might be the shortest way to get up here This way around might be the shortest way to get up here This way around trying to show this way to get up to the red This way around might be the shortest way to get to the Yoshi doodle And then this way around this way has two purposes, but I guess that's fine Um, isn't one star missing one two, three, four five six no, it's all there Someone to six man is beating you to arguing about anime in your chat ultra in sync. Oh get a Impeccable writing true A Situation who is that? You could just watch to make the cardboard box platform dissolve open up new ways or use that new skills a statue but should be waited I'm not sure understand So If we go with the assumption that we actually want what I just drew, let me just take a look here Why are you asking someone I'll rank this I'm you the one person being paid to work on it and no one else's Yeah, like everyone should ask you I feel like simple lips should hit you up and be like our powers ranked So he just gives you money for free that's a good agreement I Think we want the spawn point to be here. This is more balanced and in the middle of the level The question is which way do we look By the way, what do you think of this? I think I did this after the stream, but I really like this. It looks like we're in the room in the top room Some of the the edge still feels a little boneless we should I feel like we should put something on top Then you will get when he gets paid when simple flips gets paid I Thought at this point sim flips is like a gazillionaire I Did the background but I didn't import it so it didn't look like this I Miss paychecks, but what? Damn that really sucks out there. I Sent me like around $3,500 at this point, but I can't write an invoice to him because he didn't give me like his address So I can't really start working on him because I don't know what sales text to charge I Was smashed boxes as trees smashed boxes why a smashed box only in this course. Nope. No idea when you stop doing commissions, I still do permissions if They're fine paying a hefty price for it I have no idea what a Yoshi coins are going at by the way. They might just be near random in this level I Right now we're gonna fill should we actually already fill this in I feel like this might still be approvable But Now there's like three different paths to get to this thing, oh god There's one path to get here, which is fun The boxes of trees but slightly smashed like shit man, I don't understand this makes no sense to me. Can you send me a picture? Right, we said there should be one more box here or something at least it doesn't have to be a box Hello Hanka Hanka amazing username as usual Hello Leo I'm a bit worried with all these boxes that you don't really see the background anymore that we kind of lose the vibe for this By the way, what do you guys think of the idea of me making a video for more basic stuff stuff like How does the BLJ work in Mars 64? Like complete normie bullshit, I feel like that might do well on YouTube and that would be really good easy content to produce Yes, you like that Oh, what's with the level boundaries You will eat it anyway good We're gonna have a problem that a lot of this is really big and empty and I'm not really sure how to make this less Flat and boring, but it's all cardboard unless I like stack cardboard on cardboard Oh, it's a third of my 64 I was actually thinking next April 1st will be the mr. Beast video There will be Gavin I'm gonna release a demo soon and it will be somewhat public But it will just be course one. There will not be a bigger plate on standout really Milk a ton houses. Yeah That cardboard props, yeah, yeah We could definitely use more cardboard props What else do we have here for cardboard props cardboard rocks As it gives the full space or as a placeholder half off I Solving BLG summary 64. Let's see that Oh this video here Why is the 60 minutes oh Oh my god, okay, this is really fucking in depth Holy shit everyone wants to become a budget paladin cook not really i think the videos that work the best are the ones where you shit on the dev team yeah kind of these don't look good no I'm not shadow boy that would be a one-line change that would be very very easy to do we're not thinking about enemies right now I'm thinking about things to platform on to fill the space to make it as less lame and flat and that sucks that this video just existed like 24 days ago that ruins the entire plan oh well no I'm not gonna put Lobo in here she's crafted world let's see that the fences kind of work I kind of like the fences I don't think it's impossible Rocco but that sounds like it's gonna be far away let's do defenses yes again we're not looking for NPCs right now a lot of the ideas you guys are mentioning already exists it's not what I'm looking for I'm looking for enemies for platforms is it again I think they're pretty underused you're right there should be a cab use summer all the ships like it's gonna be way too high pulley the new blender snapping is so shit wait i want to do a meme review i want to be so special to fucking christmas eve and new year's day because it's so special so special what a special movement of this amazing life i get to fucking come and my husband so we what what this is another meme review um bad these are two bad memes i'm sorry i'm giving you some of the lowest review scores we've had yet the girl is yorking it i'm gonna do a sprite because the sprite's gonna look terrible i wish i could see how many polygons this is but look at this fucking fast 64 error lila i don't know who to blame other than lila 1836 okay so it's like almost a hundred can you wait oh i see what you mean so like paper mushrooms yeah i like that so do these things and double check and drop that many next random one yeah i know that but i don't want statistics on my screen the whole time um wait i didn't actually select shit so honestly it's kind of nice looking um there's some more scraps also quite a bit of an expensive on the level yeah some of it yes other parts no we have the disadvantage that because we're working with the real world materials here there's a lot of um uh we need to get the look right because if it looks off just a little bit it's going to be very obvious that it's wrong you know what i mean so i can use remote to set the ends fuck it and i able to send links and chat or i get removed uh you can probably send it i'm not sure i could a hawk what to whatever hawk to i could oh my god so it's really detectors um all the overdraw will for sure be an issue but i think right now we are very very good performance-wise i can look at this real quick in game if you guys want in n64 so we can get a rough idea of how this performs so far i didn't plan to bring difficulty in this course there's a lot of difficulty here don't worry about that let's get my message sorry i read that but then i forgot the response because one is being reworked in blender 4.1 with the latest version of the beta update yeah i got that um i don't know why it crashes that's not a good news so polygons are smaller than 2x2 pixels i didn't know modern consoles are shitting themselves when it happens um but no the n64 has a very funny issue and that is that it doesn't actually draw by in 2x2 pixel areas it draws in 1x64 areas so it's just a long thin stripe over and over that it's drawing and it's really bad for rendering had they used the mobile editing where they use like 8x8 squares or something like that game would be doing a lot better so what is going on did my summer come sometimes this happens and i don't know why let's unplug everything unplug this unplug this can i get back in put it back in the car by the way i saved 30 instructions on graph render today which is very exciting dude what the fuck is going on did my summer cut break did i break my n64 there we go i want to check this one real quick because of the 60 instructions uh the 30 instructions i saved yes i have my summer cart linked to my pc i'll be honest i have no idea what my number was before but this looks like a good number this used to be higher but i guess i added more stuff here 22.4 is good my hover world is basically a debug level select so we were saying paper mushrooms huh oh okay well this is actually interesting we can save a few triangles here because the z fighting doesn't matter because they look the same i think i think my logic here is out let me try that so one unforeseen issue with the debug level select instead of it crashed some boot you're not gonna know whether it's the game or the level select it's safe or nice oh this is weird the project's kind of some difference because of the light baking that's fine you see i should do mesh supply and retexture and voila really i don't think so i think we have to actually make one these are gonna be terrible yes yes stand craft we should do that with flowers i can try that real quick to see if it will look decent then we do our mushroom here dude i'm so sad gameplay changed his name because calling him mr daniel gameplay television was one of the small joys of my life so they go by day now do they care dude i had the worst nightmare i had a nightmare that it tweeted something about a transgender snail and then twitter murdered me i don't know why it wasn't the dreams you did that yesterday no so i mean isn't there a thing where if you have snails and you put them in a plastic bottle they change their sex they become more feminine because of the chemicals in the bottle so they're turning the snails yay more feminine snail yeah they get long eyelashes small snail Do you know how Disney is drawing them? None of these textures are what I was hoping for. This man has a daughter and you don't. Start doing the dishes. I was not saying that. That one's on you. Oh, I see what you mean. Like Mario 64 trees. But like, ah, yeah, yeah, Mario 64 trees could work. The only reason I don't like that idea is because Mario 64 trees look like shit. Niche micro communities of video games are turning humans more feminine. Plant cutouts. That's awful. That's also awful. Who gave me those textures? Oh, I like this. No, wait. Is that what it looks like? Are you cheating? No, I would never. She's just a friend. Wait. What is this, Darren? What are you on about? This just kind of looks like shit. I'll be honest, man. It's not going to work. Paper flow on texture research. You think there's going to be a paper flower here? Yeah, no. Hello, Ollie 64 PC. Yeah, this is not going to work no matter what. It just looks too fake. It's not the style we're looking for. If we can make this look more fake, it would work. If we had a really simplistic flower, then we could do like a polygonal cutout of. Let's think. These are all too complicated. No, I don't think so, Arthur. And you just want to cover the edges? Yeah, yeah. But we need something simpler for that. Something that we can actually cut out without going over the polygon budget. Yeah. These are also all too complicated. Something like this. This is closer to what I want. Actually, this is too high poly. Paper cutout flower. All too complicated.  like using, like using fence, like what are you using? I'm going to give the mushroom a try. What do you think I want this to look? Probably a square. It could just be like a piece of cardboard stuck on like a long piece. Or on like a toothpick or something. I guess how to go about learning your way around large codebases? I don't know. Just start. Yeah, exactly. Sticky. That's how I want this to look. How do people make paper mushrooms? Oh, like this. This is potential. Oh, how do they look? Like this. Yeah, but you can only see them from one angle. Now, either a piece of paper like this, or like you mentioned, someone takes a piece of cardboard and like squishes it. I think that would work. Or you mentioned, you mentioned this, right? This is the mushroom platform. And the way you would craft it is like you could make like a thing here. And like this, right? And now you have a mushroom base like this. I think this is what it could look like. And then on the bottom we'll have like a piece of long, a long piece of cardboard. And then maybe here we could have two stapler needles in there. Do you think stapler needles are a valid craft supply? Oh, they used plates. That's cool. And toilet paper rolls. I like the toilet paper roll. So. Dude, the toilet paper roll is too good. I can't not do this. But I'm just not sure on the stapler needle. Is the stapler needle too much? I think the stapler needle might be too rough. Like normal people wouldn't use those in crafts. Am I wrong here? What's a fuzzy stick? Oh, looks like pipe cleaner. So. So. So we'll just have this fold under here. You can put a stapler needle in here. Well, you gotta make sure you get everything to look right before you can really start working on stuff.  Should be less perfect and more like someone just helping along the lines here. So. I think this works. Volca Mountain. Volca Mountain as Shroom. No, no, no, no, no. You know what? I don't like that the mountain has no texture at all. That's actually bad. I want something with a bit of texture. So that you can see that there's a seam. Because I want the player to see the seam. The seam is very important to me. I do not have a single decent piece of texture. I'm going to put cotton balls as clouds, I think. We should do that next. Maybe I can just use a texture with a multi texture. Not this one. Make the texture. Well, I'm making a shader that will do the texture. Well, actually, I think it's easier to just make a texture. We'll also save us the two psycho modes, which has some advantages here. What the hell?  Probably not very onion kit. Yeah, I'm thinking of having enemies that shoot buttons at you somehow. I will definitely have enemies with googly eyes on them. Yeah. No.   Too much contrast on the texture. But the idea works. Yeah. No, I want the staple needle in here. I think I'm just going to make a 3D model for the staple needle. Because that's the easiest for me. And I can give it a nice shiny texture. This is a staple. The whole thing is one staple. That's messed up. Just have to set the end.  Actually, this is it, right? No. Your fat ass wants to eat the paper mushrooms. With the staple needle in it. No. This looks nice and rough. Should we maybe rotate this? This way around. I think that makes it less obvious what it is. Like yeah, realistically someone who was crafting would make it like that, but makes it less obvious what it is. Could have it slightly raised, as if it was not stapled well. It wouldn't hold that way. Or just use a flat model and you could have a few going down the mesh then. Now a 3D model is a bit easier. We can delete the bottom parts here, but yeah. I think 3D model is cheaper to render. Belts to make mushroom caps? Belts? I'm not sure I understand. To make a mushroom cap? That makes zero sense to me. Do you have a picture of that? Well, looks like we're getting the mandatory toilet reference in the case I get it anyway. Because I need a toilet paper roll. Now there only needs to be one staple and that's at the 3D model. This stream out of context would go hard. I really just need the texture you know. That's an insane texture. And you're wishlist. I really just need the texture. This one's on free3d.com for $15. I don't want to pay $15 for the toilet paper roll. 50% off, we can get one for $12 here. $3. $24. Is there maybe one on texture resource? Nope. Look man, I have reasons to look for toilet paper. Damn, this is the wrong side. Can you ask a random AI to do it? No, AI is not good enough at it yet. I might genuinely be better off that way. Artstation. $2. $3. Why is everyone trying to sell empty toilet paper rolls? Can't just give it to me for free? Toilet paper roll texture. Can't find paper rolls on... No, I don't think so. Shutterstock. This is what Shutterstock is. This is so close to what I need. I can make a texture out of this one. Fuck it, we're making a texture out of this one here. I need an account for this. Okay, I have a bad idea. We're just making a texture. Unless there's one here. There has to be a toilet paper texture somewhere in any of these. What if I just look for bathroom? Check discord. Is it a message request? I don't see UX links. How do I find this? Is it in my discord? In my DMs? Oh yes, there we go. Okay, we don't need all of this for sure. I'm just wondering which parts I do need. I'm going insane. I think I'd rather move it over this way because this way it tiles. So we need roughly a quarter of it. Wait, the texture you sent me doesn't tile. Okay. I can fix her. Um, does this make any sense at all what I just did? Will this like almost tile? Let me just check the same game. Dude, I'm confusing myself so much right now. Either way we can make a texture work. Don't ask him what that image of me. Okay, it almost tiles. Good. I probably want something kind of like this. Huh. Okay that's bad. And that's almost bad too. Now tiles. I think the contrast is too much too. This should work. Eat toilet paper. Maybe we get a bit skinnier. I was thinking that too and just because the mushroom would look better that way. But I think if it's an actual toilet paper roll then this size is appropriate. I'm just not sure about the paper texture at the top. This doesn't really look like paper to me yet. I think it could look more like paper the top part. Yeah the roll looks really good. The top part does not look good if you ask me. The stapler needle is fine. Although I think it should be seated smooth. I think a paper texture 50% opacity can fix. That's expensive. It'd be better if we could make a shader without. It's a finer detail. I think it needs a little bit of a gloss. A glow. Yeah exactly a reflective sheen. We got a reflective sheen here we need to scale the texture down. Oh well that's the easiest way to do it. And then let's switch to the Daniel combiner. Um This should be shade color. I think we can always have this game of course. Texture map of crumpled paper on the lines of ruled paper on top of the mushroom texture. Texture map of crumpled paper on the lines of ruled paper. I have no idea what you're talking about. Yes much but that's gonna be very expensive. I'm trying to keep everything a bit simpler. Because we're having a tight polygon budget here. I think it's too shiny. Hello sleek us goose. Ideal and would be ideal if we could use the textile brightness from picture one somehow. In determining where this goes. What do you think of a highlight like this? I kind of don't like that it's like overwriting the white pixels here. And now it's way too bright. And now it draws black. I think this is a good idea. This is better. I think this is our only option here. We do it like this and then we move it around. of making it white is a little difficult here because the entire thing just exists through math which makes it very difficult for me to like you know do the thing I can't just be like yeah it's white now. I don't think it looks that good ideal it would be if it actually respected the texture underneath it but it's the best we're going to get I think one two three four five six seven eight nine one zero one one one two one three one four one five one six one seven okay I'm gonna eat chocolate I deserve choccy that's fucking good say Best chocolate! Mars Candybars I like the disgustingly chocolatey murk Oh that's sick isn't it? This is what I meant with the materials need to look realistic to be convincing Cause we all know wrap paper has a little bit of a shine to it So if it doesn't have to shine, people might not identify it as a wrap paper Bounty you're fucking kidding There's no way No one likes bounty Except lizard people What is wrap paper? Do they not have Santa Claus in France? You're not a lizard person If you like bounty, you are a lizard person Tumblr rune is pretty good I think this mushroom here works These jumps are a little bit far I know it's course 14 but I don't want to force the people to long jump all the time for no reason I have become a boomer by the way I installed an automatic lawnmower and I enjoy my lawnmower right now That's fucked up isn't it? I could just stick a crayon into this box and then say people are supposed to walk up there But I wanted the platforming to be this way I can just rotate the ruler Oh but no I can't rotate the ruler Well this ruler is not even going to be here actually The ruler needs to be somewhere else Why not try making mushroom that looks like a Martini Umbrella and stem could look like a stick of cups Yeah we need simpler elements No I just modelled crayons so I could have crayons on my level None of the placements here are final Also the crayons are not gay, you are gay I still need to change the text here from crayon to Craytendo or Koopa style or whatever we decide on in the end Hello Ubuntu Alright now the question is how do we make the player go up here? And is platforming on little pins maybe a little bit too difficult? I feel like for a Yoshi coin it would be fine for just like one really difficult platforming section I think I'm gonna do that I will be evil today And then I will take some of these gay crayons as you call them and have them be platforms here Do you guys actually think that people will complain that the game is too easy? I feel like that's an insane thing to complain about I am not struggling enough But this is already gonna be a lot harder than vanilla Mario 64 Man How do we take the corner here? Okay well with Pokemon that's a really silly complaint because either the game is boring and easy or it's grindy Those are your two options Yeah probably sticky we'll probably put a decal on top We could also make a cut in the cardboard itself They would hold like this what do you mean? Easily How would a cut in the box look like? Okay so what's that? A pen and a cardboard They are the same elevation to make the jumps easier Damn you found out my secret cigarette addiction I love sucking on the cancer stick Me when highly addictive stick that will give me cancer Oh yeah this is my jam Which crayon did we not use yet? This one Let's see how that looks in game There will be tricky jumps you guys are always underestimating how difficult the game is Because you're watching me and I'm so good at this game Okay this is fucking sick oh my god this looks so fun to me But jumps like this is gonna be so difficult for some players Like yeah I can just go and do this but like most players can't And brave enough you can also just like say fuck it They are always black until we set the colors You go to bed Lila Wait Lila you're 18 now I can use adult insults at you Fuck shit bitch fuck Hello Buzzard Chris Okay this fall here it doesn't count because that's the fuck in the game Which counts for something else I feel like I should end an intended way to get up here This is a bit awkward same with this this is also awkward This is also awkward Wait can you literally just walk up? No you can't Is there glue used in the level? There is You see this area over here where there's like white shit on there? That will be a glue area and Morris jump will be short enough to jump there Because popsicle sticks are too high poly We can't make decent looking popsicle sticks without insane poly counts This also needs to lead somewhere The bank was said with the Lila how much did you steal? You said the bank was hit with the Lila What if you added little curled up corners to my cell and then this paper came down to cardboard? That one looks sick but also very expensive Oh that was never supposed to be part of the level Michael Angel That was just assets I made for later use So there's a long wallkick section here for you difficulty fans Oh I never knew this path in but yes this is a path as well So okay we got this this this So this we want to go over here and we need this to be something This can't just mean nothingness Actually before I do anything I want to know why this crashed on N64 It might be important to figure out Let's first check on Nemio Nemio boots the game oh my god this looks so cool on Nemio Everything looks so much more saturated on Nemio am I crazy? You know how you used to see the world different when you were a child and everything seemed more saturated? This is what I'm experiencing right now Why does it look so much better than Project 64? This is the intro level, this is course 14 It boots on N64 again. The framerate is already not great. I just turned on in my room. That's a lot of warping. Um, the end product will come default with CapNet30, but there will be an option here to unlimit it. Wait, if anti-aliasing is off, I gotta check this one again. Yeah, okay, we're basically at 50 FPS again, cool. 19.8 RSP, that's crazy. How goes the new Corsair? Ah, well, this has some performance issues on N64, but that's gonna be all the overdraw here. I think once we cut everything out, it's gonna be a lot better. Hi, Lina. We're at 50 before? Yeah, I was, Lina. I just wanted to make sure, because I was at 43, because anti-aliasing turned itself on again. The question is, what do we do here? Do we have any cool ideas? I have the ruler that I want to jump off of. Scissors. Oh, a rolling train like the rolling locks. No, it doesn't work here. Oh, one idea was cut on death bolts, which I guess is kind of like what we have here. Zeina's gonna be the chat mom now. Hello, Masjim. Why is a compass needle a craft item? Case Magenta. Oh, I see. Well, we are very short, though, on materials and stuff. That's true. Finding someone who has a kid in the Twitch chat like this is gonna be very rare, and then also finding a female in the Twitch chat is very rare, and both combined, chances are basically zero. Custom suit Mario plushes. Would be neat. We have to see if we have the resources for it. A confetti blizzard is a good idea still. Oh, what if we had a slide made out of half a toilet paper roll? I think that would be cool. Shit slide. No, not shit slide. Toilet paper roll slide. We just have a slide that goes down here. Let's go see bridges. They're just cardboard with toothpicks in them. So, once we're done with the level, these are gonna tilt when you step on them. I want the toilet paper slides. A slide made out of mother-in-law's thong? What's my mother-in-law got to do with this runic? The thing you blow in for birthday that unrolls? Oh, I see what you mean. Oh my god, programming the unrolling there collision-wise. You know that's gonna be completely of a nightmare. That's gonna be too much of a nightmare to do. Party horn or party blower? Party blower, alright. Mother-in-law's tongue or party blower? Very interesting. How that works out. My ex is a party blower. I kind of like the idea of adding a cannon to this, but I'm not sure where I would put the cannon. Confetti cannon? What does it do? I thought it would look cool. Leela, why don't you just become the party blower GF? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  Good job. I guess I can just put a feather here.  Heck. You got chocolate for your birthday? That's fucking sick. Can you link it here? I can try it. I couldn't find it. Now, how do I connect these? Just more of this. Another mushroom. I looked for it just now. I didn't see it. And honestly, I don't want to spend too much time looking for it right now. I'm kind of doing things right now. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It might end up being one of the most simple levels we have. Like, least poorly levels. I found 30 instruction improvement in Graph Render again. Which is also fucking sick.  Mostly from caching the GMAT stack index. GMAT stack. Bracket GMAT stack index thing. Instead of having the code recomputed over and over during loops and stuff. And then I'm saving like 4 or 5 instructions in like 3 different functions. And then I had improvements I found to Wiseguy's MTXF shadow function. With certain inlines. I realized that VAC3F cross can be inlined. And I realized that I can use the restrict keyword. On some things. So it's stack free for different small improvements. Crumpled up paper is going to be way too high poly. Yes, I solved the issue with the background. This is how it looks now. And I like it. The bottom still looks a little weird. But I think we can fix it. Should there be a MATX index? Maybe achieve it with increment and decrement pointers. That is an interesting idea. Where is this used? I don't know. Why don't we just replace this with GMAT stack add? That actually could be better. No, no, you have a point. I'm going to try to replace GMAT stack index with GMAT stack add. I will try that. That could save probably like 20 instructions or so. Maybe even more. That's a very good idea. I still don't know what to make out of this. We can't just have giant empty cardboard boxes like this. They're not fun to be on at all. Here I just have this house here, which I also don't really like. I can do many things, but that doesn't mean I should. Plushie, just a random plushie plopped on here. I don't think so. Oh, in the house. Maybe, yeah. Yeah, shipping labels on the boxes are also fine. I'm worried about getting the gameplay done first. Yeah, having more of these paper decorations would do a lot. We just have feathers, trees, and mushrooms so far. And the fence actually defends us a lot. The fence is pretty good. The fence looks so good. I don't like origami. I don't know how much polymorphogen we still have. I just have to look at it on N64 and just kind of make a random guess. We can, okay, let me just, we should look at this on N64 and figure out exactly what our lag sources are here. I'm pretty sure it's going to be like all RTP. No paper cranes. We may throw a pin, what is that? I don't understand how this is related to the level. Yeah, you can see 18 milliseconds RSP. So the RSP could run this at like 50 FPS and the RDP is at 36.8. That means it's all the overdraw. So we used around half of our polygon budget for the level. And we use more than half, more than our entire RDP budget, but the RDP budget is easy to fix. Also the idle thread is going for 32 milliseconds almost. Paper grass? I'm not sure. Oh yeah, the N64 can draw a lot more than you think. I mean, how much is this really? This is only like 3000 triangle with Mario, like 4000. Yeah. N64, 10,000 triangle. That's about right. The overdraw can be solved by removing the overdraw. Look at this dude. This is ridiculous. You see this and the background here still uses the Z-buffer. I didn't optimize anything at all yet. Hello, Hoshi. It's a bonus stream. No, this is X3. Don't get the EverDrive. Get the Summer Card. EverDrive sucks. Oh yeah, N64 is set to X3. Yeah, it looks like they're working. I didn't set this to X3 on purpose. At least not that I remember. So, I think they work. It's about the Summer Card versus the EverDrive X7. The EverDrive X7 is dog shit. It doesn't work. The Summer Card works. That's the difference. Also, the Summer Card is half the price. I'm still brainstorming with this. Just a grass plane, not a fan. It's not just the price. It's also just the X7 just doesn't work on my machine. Other people have said it works for them. Although other people have also said they have problems. The Summer Card just works. So why wouldn't you use the Summer Card? It's cheaper and it's better. Right. Just because someone has a high price doesn't mean it's better. If you paid $50 to go to a torture dungeon to get tortured and you had to take it for it and it's worth $50, would you still go to the torture dungeon? No, you wouldn't. Right. Same logic. You shouldn't buy the X7. $50? Me and the boys getting skinned alive to save $50. I would go to be honest. Yeah, you know what? I don't want to waste $50. What do I do with this? I don't want to just put holes into it. I mean, I can just put holes into it and make the player fall in if they miss. That could be kind of fun. But you could just walk around the rim. Yeah, the Summer Card is USB connected. Right. If you ever see me just hit this application here, it's uploading the ROM. And it's done. Summer Card, it took like three minutes. This, a few seconds. Yeah, the X7 worked with an SD card, which took around 40 seconds to upload. But this is a few seconds. And it's also active work, so it's like really annoying to do. We could have a bunch of blocks here and then you just climb a block fort. It could be another garden, or we look for more paper crafts or cardboard crafts. Maybe there's some fun here. This level is about crafts. So this level is all made out of crafts materials. So if you look at this, this is a cardboard fence. If you look at this, it's like a toilet paper with gift wrap on top and the staple needle in here. The tree is made out of cardboard. This is cardboard. This is crayons and a ruler. I don't think Galvanized Square Steel is fitting for this. A paper plane is planned. If you look at this paper plane, it says right here. It's going to be a paper plane here. You step on it and you fly over here. I was thinking of this as an enemy somewhere. Climbing a cup tower. I think the cups individually are too big to be climbing them like that. I also don't want to unveil the underside of the cups because the Germans can be awkward to interact with us, Mario. Patafix. Oh, this is like when you want to erase mistakes. Oh, this is glue. I remember this. Cup heads lower than a cardboard. That's a really cool idea. Did he eat it? It does look like chewing gum, doesn't it? We could absolutely have a box full of water in one of these. I think that would be really cool. What's the premise here? It's mostly just locations in Yoshi's Island. This is just a random world made out of craft material still. Yeah, basically, it's a cardboard diorama. I don't know what this is.   Yeah, Patafix can definitely be placed in things or can be used as justification for some things.  Isn't that this here? Isn't this a thumbtack? Is this a bucket? No, no, this is paper around it. It's painted paper around it.  That's why there are strokes here. But I want to look at more cardboard crafts to see if there's anything I can put on a level. This is made out of cardboard. Well, the top part is a gift wrap here. That's why it's shiny in-game. You don't see the shine here. And then the bottom part is a toilet paper roll or like a kitchen paper roll with a tag in it.       What is that? What is that? What the fuck? I'm uncomfortable. What is that? This is kind of cool. We could use little triangles like this. Something made out of cardboard like this would for sure work. Just a folded cardboard mountain. How would a cardboard mountain look like? Imagine King Bob-omb's mountain made out of cardboard. Playing Cards Castle? No, no, no, no. We don't want to just have toys. What if I just stack a bunch of cardboard on top of each other? I think that should work. Maybe I just have to make the thing and then you will believe what I'm talking about. What is that? There's an insect on my face. What is that? What is that? What is that? Like I mentioned, this is made out of cardboard. I feel like that just works. What is that? Cardboard dioramas? Dioramas? Yeah, there's some cool stuff in these. What is that? I wonder if the platforming here is any decent now. I just don't want it to be boring. Aluminium foil? I would like it to be part somewhere. I'm just not sure where it could be part yet.  There we go!  There we go! There we go! There we go! So we will slide here and do a slide jump. And then getting up here is a little difficult, I guess. Oh, there's still this weird invisible wall here. I don't know why there's an invisible wall here. Without the invisible wall, I feel like this would work. By the way, the idea here is that there's Luigi Doodle and you draw a star for him and then you get a star. I do like the mountain area, though. Yeah, it's not that there's an invisible wall here, it's that there's just no more geometry here. For some reason, the game didn't put any triangles there. Which, of course, it should have put some there. We had a similar issue before. But yes, I like this idea of there being a grassland, a mountain land, maybe a volcano land, a water land or something like that. Just a bunch of different environments. And that's how we're going to style this level. So this will be cardboard that looks like mountains and then there will be cardboard that looks like something else. We can think of what we want the different environments to be like as well. But that's not so important to me right now. I'm going to cave mine on the side of a box. That sounds very cool, too. One of these boxes will be enterable. And I'm thinking the entrance should be here so we can have aluminum inside that thing a lot. But for now, I'm feeling done. And I will see you guys in the next stream, whenever that may be. Bye bye.
