You You You You You You Hello You You What You How's this I guess Nvidia broadcast fucked out again awesome I Guess what I go we're gonna RNG. I don't know ask RNG And buzz and sound yep, oh there we go How's that I fixed it I Didn't know upstream, okay, so we have a little secret area here you're not supposed to be able to find this, but you are able to find this and Then this will lead to the back side of course once entrance You get to go into the windmill of course one Which Is cool as hell and Then this is for a secret level you stand on this and you roll just did the rock by standing on it Just like a Yoshi's Island and that opens a path Drug was runs nice onion 64 that's surprising, but that's cool. I don't buy a mic You Scallops truck, please do not call anything change. I'll relate scallops. This is not owned by scallops. Thank you Raymond to know don't say Raymond to making it worse for me You You You I mean those great heads you can press the other levels. Oh, I didn't know that See in my in my brain Raymond, who is like saved us that that one solace game somehow As remember watching a streamer player that the game pissed me off a lot You I'm second design for the vet lab part of the rocket the VAT lab. Oh With the long glass tubes I I Was thinking we're gonna put like specimen in there and there's going to be like tentacles and the glass tubes. Well, that's the wrong button Like Yoshi tentacles, you know what I mean from this good Yoshi's I Think it would look very very cool I am glad you enjoy my work What did you guys think of today's heck upload was it a good video was it a bad video You know how to design the room hmm, I mean I think I was thinking like a portal lab kinda Hmm these kinda work I Learned is a huge fan of GTA. So I think you'll introduce him to the romhack. Nice What the hell just happened How did I make the game crash by doing that What the fuck Let's try that again You To be honest on the game isn't really much like GTA like the game's more like something else It's just I used to GTA name because I knew that would get clicks What about the layout better since the exit is a different place now, oh I see Okay, I see the dilemma So By design you literally mean game design and not like layout design See a lot of the time people used the word design to mean like visuals and that's why I was thinking you were doing that too Hmm Honestly, it just needs to be like a couple generic jumps. I don't think it needs to be anything super special They remember you aren't just tripping anything you remember me I don't remember you You are the guy that makes a lot of money by asking to make more money I Wouldn't be peak because half-life 1 is garbage dog shit I hate being in the room and pressing the interact button on everything hoping something will happen. This is not fun guys Sorry to rage Bane And the day another dime, thank you for the dime Zita Zita Okay, I think what we'll do today is the back entrance to the bunny forest You Hello Matthew death and everyone leave row is a wave rose not a particle You As a bonus a particle and the wave no way What I want is very easy to know where to go Mm-hmm Right, right the only opposition you get in half-life 1 actually is Not oh, I don't know where to fuck to go It's actually the fights because the fights are so exciting because the fights in our place They're actually good see what you do in a fight is you walk up and you press the escape button and you press safe state and then you Shoot and you get shot back and the guy hits you and then pieces cave when you press load state and then you shoot Back and the guy doesn't hit you so you press safe state again. It's peak Getting better at range breathing You Which painting is so easy because my honest opinion is just a range paint What about the second game, I don't know if I played it Yeah for for the sake of being Monetizable if you agree with me, I'm serious Unless you disagree with me in which case I'm just joking. This is for everything I say this goes for everything Do you by any chance have schematic for it you can share I can't find it any online. Nope. I don't I mean a significantly better one. It sounds like You are admitting that half-life one is significantly worse than a different game You And we need to shade us on we're gonna do the inside of the per the the windmill right now Any second we're gonna start soon as Brenda lets me You And I'll just shade X that's true Mario 64 2 will be big You I would be a little surprised if there were actually not many people that are like super excited for substance more 64. I Didn't think it was a game that would excite my youtube audience a lot but people seem to take the idea Someone commissioned you to buy less than a console would you do it? Yes, but I would probably ask something like Five hundred thousand dollars upfront or maybe I do it for like 300,000 You You As I'm great is not playable in console it never has been Might be important You You can idle animation Mario taking a dump you can ask pixel palavera to do that for you. He is the animator on the project You You You brah who turned on snapping Somehow all my UVs are on a grid. I can't believe it. How do I turn it off again? Also, we need an OST. I just realized. Wait! Pixel Palabra wanted an OST. What was it? He asked me for an OST. I forgot what it was. I want to put it on. Let's see. Can I find it? Neverhood. Okay. I think my PC is running. It's snapping to some weird grid. A grid of pixels. I fixed it. So This is a crazy OST when I'm playing with the finger magic Okay we've got pixel rounding snapping okay but rounding and snapping to a grid are literally the same thing Those are equal concepts I can hear world buzzer a little bit yeah That one right Gang how easy is it to install a PCME SSD onto my motherboard I tried it and then I found out there's no slot for it on my motherboard So now I think I need to pay someone to install a new motherboard for me But I fear it's going to be annoying I don't want to do it myself because I'm scared I called the guy and he said yeah I can do it in five minutes but my minimum order is like $300 So if you want to pay me $300 for five minutes of work you can do that But it would be a stupid move is what he told me How many drives do you have in there well one I have one NVMe slot But I also have two external SSDs I said like SSDs that are also attached and they're inside the tower but they're not like on the motherboard He sound awfully German for a Canuck I do not know what a Canuck is He said like I said the insult for Turkish people but translated to English Or is this like a word for Canadians Something again being honest stressing me out can you do shift tab no This is Return to Yoshi's Island I like this texture for on top of here Or we can try to use this maybe How would the top of it look like My snapping habits are incomprehensible how my snapping habits are perfect The crazy OSD So I just have a very programmer Style workflow You Go faster Song by the guy who says Burger King at the end of the Burger King ads I wish I understood that joke I bet it's a banger It's very remarkable just plain blender just plain blender So Oh this is what's in here I don't want to make this this looks fucky to interact with So I like this more let's have like the wooden bar here Let's just have a second layer here and then you can climb it with the middle somehow I guess saying the brand name is more full at the end That's disgusting why would you put that in your head I need something in my mouth to properly intimidate that Intimidate is the wrong word impersonate Impersonate is also the wrong word to give an impression of that imitate Okay, so if we have a second layer here I was thinking that'd be like a blue coin switch and you press it and it just gives you a bunch of blue coins um The difficulty here should probably just be finding the thing itself, but I'd also like it to look like a windmill inside Now we can't just copy the fucking thing They have an ocarina of time, but I don't think the fucking thing They have an ocarina of time in any way resembles any real windmill So I don't want to do it because then everyone's gonna be like, oh, it's the fucking thing from ocarina of time No one's gonna be like, oh, it's a windmill Yeah There is no star in here, this is purely a secret area This is the most fucked up ost of all time Um Collect a couple blue coins and then you leave again that is literally it This area is supposed to be very very difficult to find like I don't want people to go there I just want it to exist Secret areas don't need stars. They can just exist. They can just be nice, you know, I mean If we really want actually maybe a secret star wouldn't be so bad Because like think about it if we just make this a secret level It's one more free star and we don't have to make this part. Of course one Okay Honestly i'm starting to like that idea it's one free star to add to the game Jeremy burger king is called the burger fuhrer true You are usually with a lot more to write on you absolutely not Foreign Now i'm 50 50 on whether we put a star in here or not I'm in course on a static when you get here You can turn a gear or something and it spawns a star and probably makes the wheel turn in course one No, I want the Would I be okay with the wheel not turning in course one One What if we did the opposite you break the windmill permanently Or maybe there's someone here that broke the windmill and you destroy him Hmm No, this is the bunny village they're not enslaving yoshis The goober no, it's the bunny village Oh, you know what would be dark if there were like goon bunnies turning a wheel to turn the windmill and like You do all of course one and you save the bunnies from the goon bunnies And then like half the game later you find out that actually the bunnies were like slaveholders That'd be dark, I don't think we can do that Haunted by a boo. No doesn't fit with course one I mean we could actually just put like five goombas in a wheel here And the goombas are turning it and you beat the goombas for a star And then you leave and the windmill is permanently turned off That would be such dark lore Why would you make anyone rotate the wings of a mill this is not how a windmill works I know Maybe the goombas are just being punished for being goombas Is The working levels you should do medieval level we're doing a couple side levels right now um There are some side level themes There are some side levels we have that are only like we only have a mechanic down that we still need a theme for So medieval is perfectly possible still But it would be like a very gimmicky medieval level So Right now though what we're thinking about is we have this secret path here in our overworld That we want to lead to the back side of course one So like you beat course one you get through 70 of the game and you find the secret tunnel And suddenly you're back in course one in like a secret area that you couldn't access before So an alien that's being swung from the ceiling because he got his feet caught in a rope and he stopped the windmill to free him Oh So We could have like A spinning windmill here and the bunny attached to it and it just keeps turning around and around And you have to free him that would be very funny Yeah Just thinking about the best way to actually make this concept work So the idea is you would save someone and that just passively stops the windmill because we want your actions to affect the world So I promise I don't really want to do a bunny here. I think i'd like to avoid that So Probably have to put this in a side level though for sure actually Yeah I think we just need an easier way While we think about that, let me write excalibus just a little bit Foreign Bobby That is true army, but that's a little dark topic wise But I like the idea that there's someone you're spinning it and that they're actually kind of not desire to be there Or I mean we could literally just go with bio-vex idea where maybe there's like a thing spinning here And you have to push against it as Mario, but what do you think to push against it? I guess we have other places where you have to push against objects. So it's not that bad And then someone's singing from the ceiling here They think it couldn't go ham on the triangle in the rocket There's basically no one or except the first in that room and you look up down. Yes for sure. I Don't think Tricon is really a concern here. The concern actually is memory size But I think I freed up a good amount of memory But I am a bit worried that you're gonna run out of RAM if you had too much detail And it's a good bunny stash there and later when the stash is gone the bunnies need help to retrieve it No I think the top part needs to be a bit darker That looks better That's Jekyll So I'm back at the game as well. Just this level in particular because of the retro section and all those the blinking lights Man this moved from a blue coin section to a full-on star Crazy. Blinking lights. Yeah in the retro section. There is a bunch of blinking lights. It's a lot of textures Is George Trite in the Mario Drunk game? No, he's not. He is a racist Instagram meme I think if I put him there people would murder me And I couldn't even be mad about it I'm gonna hum on a bird bird Oh Yeah, this fucking thing. This is not in windmills is it? This is just a thing Ocarina of Time made up I'm gonna hum on a bird bird Bird bird bird bird Bird bird bird Bird bird bird bird Bird bird bird bird Oh god, it copies all the shaders, doesn't it? Oh no Tomatoes and potatoes and potatoes It has been moved to being a side level It has been moved to being a side level It's not like we used cap out of the metal cap here Not that, maybe we did use cap out of the metal cap 0x51 Level mineshaft, there we go Oh, that's huge Yep, this is a fucking giant map The age of MS2 went now? No, we're doing the inside I use it these days to rip all my other text from a given text forum I want to get an essence of the sound style of Majora's Mask and look at the references For Majora's Mask specifically, it's probably pretty easy Because the decompilation already did all the work for you I should have added the warp Why didn't I add the warp to course 1? I don't know how to win this computer I think all the decompilations are made with Linux It's probably fine SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE SE ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ 149 is a good amount. ♪ ♪ I would say I approve that amount of triangles for an enemy. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Honestly, maybe it works. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ They have bangers like this in Breath of the Wild? What the hell? How's your day? Pretty good. I got some piece of work done that I thought would take way longer in very little time, and I'm... dude, I'm so gloated. That's it. I put the stupid crypto mining rig that Zeyna found on Facebook Marketplace today, and someone's just like, hey, you put this for way too low, you should ask for $150 instead of $50. And I'm like, okay, that sounds great, we'll do that. YouTube video idea of Lender Noob vs. Pro vs. Hacker featuring Kaze Emanuels God. Banger idea. Much like Crypto Miner Edition. I was thinking about this. We have an idle thread. The idle thread doesn't do anything. How funny would it be if just to flex, we put in a crypto miner in the idle thread that mines crypto on your N64 while you're playing? It wouldn't even really cost us any FPS. Yes, Kake, sometimes you have to deliberate your options. What do you mean? Do you want me to just pick a random one? And go with the 512x512 one here? Oh no, Kaze spends time making his shaders instead of just drawing triangles. What a poor 3D modeler he is. Oh, you meant that as like a compliment? Like I 3D model so fast that most of my time is just spent scrolling through textures? Because that's like a constant time thing? I see, I see, I can kinda see it. Who pinged me? I don't know. You're like 2Ping, I was like, we can't wait to see how the viewers are doing. Yeah, I wanna sell the stupid crypto mining rig that Zeyna found on the street. I wanna get rid of it, I want the space in my house. Oh, it just didn't have the texture applied, okay, that makes sense. Wouldn't you be excited to get rid of a stupid crypto mining rig that's like sitting on your stairs? Another stupid question. I'll make sure to redeem the points reward if you're gonna ask a stupid question. This is the FBDX3 microcode. It is very, very good. What? There's an FBDX4? Well, it's so good that you don't need an FBDX4. That's why. Never thought about that. You should ask, if FBDX2 is so good, why does FBDX3 exist? That's the real question. Yeah, exactly! Why does it exist if FBDX2 is so good? Think about it. Isn't that a much more sensible question? The answer is, it's not that good. And that's why FBDX3 has to exist. Sacre bleu! That's what Biomek would say. I don't know if he says that. Do French people actually say sacre bleu? I don't know. Yeah, it's what you would sound like if you were French or Italian. Why does that not exist? You guys know that Twitter black or Chinese edit guide? They need to be like someone who edits people to be like French or Italian. What is the correct selection here? These nuts in German? Diese Nüsse? Ask them and then mineshaft. Okay, I see. Right, we select the folder here, not the level name. That makes sense. I don't know. You're French and you have never said sacre bleu once in your life? What? So they don't say that all the time? Do Italians say proc or dio all the time? Or dio is meat? No, that's Spanish people. What do Italian people say? Right? Or is that like an insult? True! How did I not think of mamma mia? Obviously they say mamma mia. My heart! She took it! Wow! Okay, my game, you know everything they say. True. Where's my silo as well? How did I not see that? I don't know if that's true. Broken objects, Cr8! It's all true. Well, okay. And the exit need to shine like the entrance. The exit shines and the entrance doesn't. That's on purpose. I mean, stuff breaks all the time when you upgrade the engine so much. That's completely normal and expected. Why did no one tell me? Well, it's because I didn't get photos just because it didn't exist as a memory, but you see, it wouldn't exceed the expectation. Really? I see. I think there still plays the memory order though. Okay, this is starting to look neat. A little bigger than I'd like, actually. Let's make it a bit smaller. Nope, there's going to be two Goombas that push it. There we go. That is true, I did kinda learn to code like that. Oh, that's not that big a disadvantage. My favorite viewer, that's a tough one. I will DM who my favorite viewer is to my favorite viewer right now, okay? If you've received my message, then that means you're my favorite viewer. Oops. Oops. There's N64 games that also just do the lighting on the CPU, so it's like, eh. I don't know. Oh no. Oh. I just don't know what the fuck that name again. I really should be supporting the old names, but I don't want to. Okay. Next we also need to place the Goombas at the correct location. And we need the Milgoombas to actually act like Milgoombas. I don't think they really need to do anything. They don't need to do this. They don't need to do this. And that's just Goomba death stuff. Which really shouldn't be duplicating code like this, but oh, fuck it. Spawns lost. This is very lazy code. This is very bad code. You shouldn't be coding like this. That's fine. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think we might have to do more stuff than that later on. Okay. So I'm writing it like this. Okay. Give me eight messages. Okay. Is he working on DLC? DLC, what? Do I just have the star already when I didn't know? I might have accidentally cheated the star in before. Let's just save the game. Oh, I didn't like the act name there. The whole graphics thread just crashed when I did that. How could that be? Hmm. Are the Mill Goombas just that evil? Is the Dark Mind Chef not loading the general purpose objects? Is that what's going on? It is not. That would do it. No console has lighting or video graphics, that's all fake. All they do is geometry, color pixels and charge their phone. Okay. So, one of the Goombas wasn't showing up and that might be related to that. Or not, because that doesn't make any sense. Huh? Oh. Why did I do that? What the fuck? Right, now I should be able to beat the two Goombas. Hey! And then after beating those two, the other eight will just jump out and attack you. And after beating everyone, you get a star. That's how it will work! This is good now. That still needs work. I don't need this file anymore. The Goomba star spawn. Is this spoilers? Yes, you are watching a development stream, it's all spoilers. Don't want this. Okay, that seems good. Then we just need the eight Goombas jumping out. What? Ten out of ten and the star is already here. Okay, so the way this works is... Goomba is here. Kill Goomba. It slows way the fuck down. Kill this Goomba. It's gone. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's peak. It's peak. Okay. And then we need Goombas jumping out here. Hello Brandon Schütz. Hello Brandon Schütz. Hello Brandon Schütz. It's with two S's. The second S stands for S16. That is on purpose. You know, every time you ask it goes back one day. So, right now we're, I think, in 2050. I'm not sure it sets the parent. It is on J.7. Goomba count undeclared. That's fine. You know what? I don't really care. Actually, we can do better. That's a lot cleaner. I got my Succor. I'm just goated. No! Once you touch this thing, it just takes off and kidnaps you. So it's... Ugh. Yeah, it needs to not do that. I don't like this song. This song sounds like when the spider walks. Huh. I know what happened. Why is the spider walking all over the song? Get the spider out! No! I don't want the spider. Am I crazy? There it is again. I had a dream today. That I was in a comic book shop. And there was a really fucking beefy Ivysaur on a comic book magazine. And it just said ADOLF in big capital letters above it. And I looked inside it and it was a story about this big beefy Ivysaur called Adolf. I'm good at interpreting the meaning of dreams. You can tell me what that's about. I'm an invisible boss for bikes. Wow! That's a lot of Goombas. This webcomic about a beefy Ivysaur named Adolf. Yeah, sounds about right. Oh, I know what happened. I forgot to kill myself. From right here. Classic German dream. Shut up, furry! Don't get this wrong. For everyone online who just joined. This guy said he's not a German furry. For no reason. Out of nowhere. And we all believe he's a furry. And he's German. So doubt that we're doing that bit to him. There's nothing wrong with being a furry. Ooh, that works. But they should be jumping out more. I feel like they aren't jumping out enough right now. Honestly, fair point. I need to make a webcomic about Adolf the Ivysaur. Fuck, I just realized I haven't updated the Patreon credits in a while. I fucked up. Sorry, I had to run the Patreon. I forgot to credit the Patreons in like 2 or 3 months because I haven't updated the Patreon credits. I'm stupid. They should all agree immediately. Yeah. I can probably figure that out. I think there's just an action set we can send them to. Goomba bully bee Goomba. Is that one? No. Making them target Mario. Action 1. Okay. Let's try that. Also, the star here needs to spawn star 1. I wonder if that will do it. I think it will, but I'm not 100% certain. I'm also not sure if this will kick me out, because I'd like this to not kick me out. And subtext? No accents. That should do what we want. Oh my god. Americans and their capitalization. Is the ridge fair running? Yes. I've been trying to catch him for the last two weeks. No luck. He's too fast. Oh, bad read, green stash. Bad read. Zero out of ten. Okay, I don't think I can just make the Goombas chase you like that. Got the wrong star. At least it didn't kick me out. Making the Goomba not chase me. Oh, wait. What's even making him decide to chase Mario? Is it just the distance? We can cheat a little bit. Well, we can cheat a little bit. We can do that. Fuck it. Is that just a bench behind me? Yep. I lift weights. Okay, this is awesome. Where did everyone go? Where did everyone go? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What is going on? Why do all the Goombas go upstairs now? Their stomach is still attacked by the green stache Maybe I'm wrong Their stomach is still attacked by the green stache I think, or maybe not Maybe I'm wrong Okay, let's try this Let's make the Goombas of BPM4 have a bigger radius Okay, they fell out of the world Okay, they fell out of the world That's fun I'm concerning that it can happen. We need to, we need something for that, unfortunately. Oh, that sucks. Dude, wait. I've seen this in Kingdom Hearts. This happened in Kingdom Hearts 1 when I played it. That's crazy. You can put the door elevators, the goombas can not go into the door. I don't want that either. But it might actually be necessary. But why aren't they turning away from the wall, actually, is the question, in my opinion. Well we can cheat a little bit, because they're only in this one level, and this one level is easy to cheat. And we're like, yeah, we move them all in here, which I think we should just do that instead of trying to fix the level geometry. Okay, is handgrip back to be okay? My grip was never wrong. It's when I bent the wrist. What do you think about the hottest teaspoon in the game? I don't know. I just remember in Kingdom Hearts 1, we were like fighting a horde of enemies, and then all enemies were gone, and we just had to stand there for like 30 seconds before it actually registered as winning. There's a little time before the area is considered safe to pause. Oh, no, it wasn't even pausing. It was like, there was like a cutscene we were waiting for. The new trendy fast food item is in France. It's not baguette. There's no way it's baguette. It has to be like something stupid, like la bubu sauerkraut. Chicken on rice, ooooh. That's not even stupid. How is that trendy? It's normal food. Okay, fuck it. I guess we just hack this together. Chicken drumstick is not great. I don't like chicken drumstick actually, though. Chicken drumstick is like all the bad parts of eating an eel without any good leftover parts of eating an eel. Aaaaah! Yo, they were tripping. Why are they tripping? I fucked up something here. Oh, that's why they were tripping. Seriously, though, why no star? Why am I not getting the star that I should be getting? I did export it, right? Is there anything setting this b-prime wrong? I don't think so. Hmm. Yeah, I don't see it. Unless I already have the star, but if I did already have the star, then it means that this part isn't working. So that's not great either. Let's try it one more time. Is girlfriend still low-accuracy? What do you mean by kiss girlfriend? It's funny how they're panicking. Oh, it did not export the level! Alright, I think this is awesome, though. It's cool. I like it. It's cool. It's fun. This shouldn't happen, though. And then you're here and it's like, what the fuck? That's where I was? I was in the windmill? Can you live here for like 15-20 years or is this what you do? Huh? How do you do that? Where I live? That's like, not even water for a month. A week, oh, okay. That's still insane? But four and a half times more reasonable. Alright, and now the windmill should be deactivated after getting the star. Anyone miss missing tulips? What? I know I used to live off 70 euros a month back in 2014. But since then there's been an insane amount of inflation, so I don't think I could do that anymore. Have I left any items above 3 euros? Okay, yeah, that would work. Works. I don't think there's any absence to doing it this way, but I guess it doesn't matter. Actually, I explicitly don't want to do it this way, because this can lead to timing issues. Alright. Okay. You can live pretty well on negative 200 euros a month, actually. All you need to do is shoplift a couple items that are expensive and easy to smuggle out, sell them, and then live off the rest. And then pocket the 200. Okay. This is pretty cool. I'm pretty happy with this mission, what do you guys think? See, this is a perfect example of how this mission has zero difficulty. Obviously it's easy as hell, but it's cool. It's so cool. The fact that you get to, after beating 9 different levels, you get to go back here and find the secret windmill. That, from having seen people play the demo, everyone would like to enter. And now you actually get to enter it. And it's like, yeah, there's just one more star. I mean, it's turning a little if you push the thing yourself. Nah. It stops rotating. It wouldn't make any sense. Okay. Well, I guess we did that now. There's our side level list. Okay. Okay. Alright. We finished an entire start today. That's pretty good. An entire side level. In one day. Plus, we finished ideating it. Pretty happy with that. Hopefully, next time, we can... What are we working on next time? Probably the chomp rock here and the conspiracy theory Yoshi that lives behind the chomp rock. Maybe we can start working on the Shy Guy Swamp side level, or at least the entrance for it. I still have to figure that one out. And then we'd already be done with the Mushroom Plants and we'd be able to move on to this part of the world. Part 11 out of 14. Tomorrow, next week. I don't think I'll be able to stream tomorrow. I'm just so busy. So, yeah. I will be seeing you guys next stream. Bye bye!
