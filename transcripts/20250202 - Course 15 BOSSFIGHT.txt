Hello. Silly. How are you? Good. Hello, Bingus. Hello, Selton. So the boss is gonna be a Yoshi Kraken, but he doesn't look like a Kraken right now. He just looks like a floating hat with some tumors grown on it. And you destroy the tumors to beat him. Hello, nice dude. It's your boy, Bingus. Oh, snap. He's an owl. How do you see an owl? You're crazy. Actually, I can kind of see it. The owl house? What's that? Any OST wishes for today? Hello, Easy. So he's probably going to attack with these tentacles right here. And the tentacles are going to go like shwoop. You know what I mean? And you're gonna have to find the tumors on the tentacles to beat them. Zelda OST? Let's do Zelda 1 OST. Let's see if it's any good. There's 12 songs in here. It's Gatun, Magic and Witches and shit like that. And there's a lot of owls you could imagine. Oh, I see. Yes, this is the Yoshi. That's not a Kraken. It's a pentapose. I was thinking, how come there's only octopuses? Why is there no septapose or hexapose or pentapose or tetrapose? You know what I mean? So we made a pentapose. So It's a pentapose. So I had the craziest idea for easter eggs with them and I will not tell you how they work. I'll just tell you that it's a crazy idea and it's going to be awesome. I also started back up. Dang, that sucks. I feel sorry for you. Going to class is the worst. So Yoshi was, it is kind of a Yoshi boss, but it's a pentapose. Why nine? What do you mean nine? Oh, you have to be at school until nine? The hell? Why not any Metroid music? You're asking this as if I had carefully considered every video game OST in existence and come to the conclusion that the best option right now is to listen to the Zelda 1 OST. So So What an awful song. Oh my god, I can't listen to this OST. How about the Zelda 2 OST? Great song. Love it. Okay, this one's a bit difficult because what we need to do here is write out the position of the tentacle, render the ward, and then use spline interpolation, not spline interpolation, but spline hitboxes to like figure out where the tentacle hitboxes are. No, not every one of the 15 main courses has a boss fight, but many do. Let's see, one has one, two has none, three has one, four has none, five has one, six doesn't have one, seven. Which one is course seven? Actually, course two does have one. Um, seven. Oh, Bowser's thingy doesn't have one. Eight doesn't have one. Nine has one. 10 is, uh, which one is course 10? 10 has one, 11 has one, 12 does not have one, 13 has one, 14 does not have one, 15 has one. We have eight boss fights, nine boss fights in the main courses. That's actually kind of a lot. How many does that make for us? We have King Bob-omb, we have the Womp King, nothing in JRB or CCM, we have like four boss fights in Big Bull's Haunt, we have two boss fights in Leaf the Lava Land, we have one in Shifting Sand Land, nothing in HMC, nothing in DDD, nothing in Snowman's Glant, nothing in Wintry World, nothing in Tal'Dorei Mountain, nothing in Titan, no, one boss fight in Tiny Huge Island. Yeah, we have six boss fights in the original Mark 64, in the main courses. Sonic Heroes OST is a banger. Fuck it, let's listen to that. Sonic Heroes, Sonic Heroes. God, I wish this game was good. Imagine if they like make an update to this where they fix all the bullshit. I might be crashed without a sound. I can feel your every rage, step aside I'll serve the flage break through your crazy maze like a laser beam my eye on you. Watch me roll the night away watch me save the day feel my soul It's getting close and heading your way. Sonic Heroes, Sonic Heroes. Find you, confine you, defying your plans. Sonic Heroes, Sonic Heroes. What the hell? Setting the stage for a kill of the plans. Sonic Heroes, Sonic Heroes. Here for some reason and we're on our way. There we go. This is the function we need. Hello ShaneMGD. Good evening or auch moin.  Sonic Heroes, Sonic Heroes. So this is how they're supposed to work. Okay I see. In that case we've used zero right? No we've not used zero we've used this one. Let me just make some changes here. Let me make sure it still works. Yeah I don't think an android part is like super unlikely to happen. I might legitimately just use um YSK static recompilation to properly import the game to like everything at once. So you wouldn't even need an emulator. Hopefully YSK can help with that. Hello XBM. It's going pretty well. Dude I tried to 100% Sonic Heroes but the game is just so jank that you constantly die to like bugs and random bullshits. And that really really sucks. Wait did I fuck it up just now? I did. Oh no I wasn't supposed to do that. I did the opposite of what I was supposed to do. So um oh and I'm staying in the sides which I'm treating use. Wait did I fuck with that? No I did not. Perfect. Preview on window screen released in full screen what could go wrong testing wise? I don't understand. I tried to do that silly bomb but there's like 10 minute stages where like 8 minutes into the stage a bug can happen and you die and it's just so stupid. So um This is true you've been here forever. You are just part of the ship now. Part of the ship, part of the crew or whatever. So Giga true I remember Giga. He kept saying he was gonna wave hi to me whenever I visit Freeman and then he never did. I thought I was gonna see him IRL. I also remember GTM's whole thing. No it's not coming out of his mouth it's like everywhere around his body. So just in window screen recording it's not full screen like released. Okay but window and full screen is like an emulator thing right? I have nothing to do with that I'm making an N64 game. Whether you play in windowed or full screen mode that's like up to you and the emulator should handle it fine it's not my responsibility. So So True XBM you've been here for a long time too probably like since 2019 which is also like six years. God you've all been around forever. Maybe my chat is getting old. 2020 I think it was around here maybe 2019 maybe not. There's also a BG Suit who's been around here like every stream for a long time and then he just kind of disappeared. I wonder what happened to him. Improved student. Okay there's one beta is still active in discord so I see beta still a decent bit. I have never forced anyone into child labor so far. I need a few more billions before I can do that. So So Man x-bot all selected is so much nicer than the other option. That didn't seem to have exported anything though. The hell? Hello Sam memory Um, what the hell is going on here? Why does it say success but not record anything or export anything? Let's do an epic commit and check this out Man this song is so good I don't really care if people bring up politics or not I just engage with whatever chat throws at me But as soon as you bring up a topic that can get me cancelled I will not engage with that You can then see the because they're different than java no all programming languages are very easy Mutant Yoshi Tentacle 0.0.1 That's not what I wanted at all Maybe a DeepSeek language that JVB runs? Well right now it seems DeepSeek doesn't really do special compared to ChatGPT like it doesn't seem to be considerably better so until that happens I'm not really interested in making another video because I feel like it's just going to be a repeat of what I did before but if at some point DeepSeek does become considerably better than ChatGPT I will definitely make a video about it You're a vogue? No! Generally I have no political positions for the purpose of if you there's something called the halo effect and it is that if people like you they are going to assume other good things about you so if no one knows what like my political beliefs are then people are more likely to assume my political beliefs overlap with theirs and they will like me for it so I think it's better to just not talk about or not make any controversial political statements this is what all politicians do I'm just being honest about it Hello Christian Iharsen Mar being a ragdoll when he dies would be very funny Okay this is a very complicated geolayout let me understand if this is all exported correctly first Position of the first bone seems good It seems to be the position of the second bone We do a little bit of translation and then we'll run a little more Yeah this looks perfect! Iharsen Bro is aura maxing True Dude I've watched Django Unchained for the first time this week I've watched it twice actually like I like the movie that much and in that movie like the main character is also just aura maxing that's like his whole thing all he does is aura max he's like not even a good guy he's just like an aura farmer and I love that about the movie I think he's like a critique of good guys almost where he like pretends to be a good guy but really all he wants to do is aura farm and in that sense he's like a parody of normal normal hero movies I don't know why but with that constant as you mentioned I erased the person going I like Keizo Manu because he's a racer like me look I wouldn't want to be uh This is something Arthur Tilly constantly says Arthur Tilly says when I don't make a political statement Arthur Tilly always says guys Keiz cannot make a statement on this he cannot lose his favor with this neo-nazi audience part and that's so funny No it does not iris we have nine boss fights in the courses What did you do in this level the last five days? I made this whole area here and I made this whole area here I finished two whole areas I once had planned six side levels which would include the four cab levels but nowadays there's a good chance that it's actually going to be like nine side levels You Of course with an of course like the metal cap I don't really know if I want that but maybe You This is the power plant right You will not be in this everybody mentioned at the moment aren't that it runs locally and you can do a lot of tuning because it's open source so it could be better It running locally is definitely an advantage but that doesn't mean it's going to be better programming right so that's my concern here I wouldn't want to waste a lot of my time trying to renew it I don't really think much about co-op deluxe so many people are trying to port my hacks to co-op deluxe but every time there's a heck of a lot of custom porting they fail at it and a little annoying my general policy is if you can do it on yourself without my help you can do with my hacks whatever you want but as soon as you start asking me for help I'm gonna be annoyed Unless it's like very minor thing then I don't really mind that much So I'm just about to be serious with your co-op deluxe I've seen that but when I looked at it it didn't even work right does it work right now Because every time people do that they just do like a really poor job porting it and I'm not a fan of that  Hello B-Turk oh shit did you just give me a free Prime sub I didn't get a notification that is awesome thank you for the $2.50 So Can you show me like a video of it let's see H, A, O, D, X Let's see if it works you have a red coin radar that is not intentional not supposed to have one These are not the moves you have normally in this game but I guess that's just co-op for you What the hell is that what what the fuck is that that's not what this is supposed to look like I guess that's a custom skin Where's the water wait the whole water is missing they didn't import the water into the game and they didn't import the background into the game So That's not even close to working And you can just stand on the water now this is a terrible port they didn't even try I'm sorry it's cool they ported it I appreciate it I like that more people can play my hacks but that's like barely even a port you just rip the model and like put the stars in there What it works but you no it didn't work what The background was missing you could walk on the lava I didn't see any of the Peach's Fury stuff in there it was just the map ripped Is the night side really let me look at this again Let's see there okay this is a different one this is a more advanced one maybe there's more stuff here okay that looks a lot better already all right they also have the floor now okay and they have the movement this is very good so far okay the death looked a little jank but it's decent Let's see do they have my other stars Oh they even have my coins Yeah I must have looked at the really old version Okay these are supposed to trampoline you upwards they didn't implement that and this cloud looks very wrong that's not rendering right Why is this missing though Oh you made this Oh that's not rendering right Okay so I can clearly see that there's yeah this is also not rendering right I can clearly see that some parts of this are pretty rough but like most of it is there I guess Is the carousel there it's gonna be the real test That's supposed to be a slide Let's see does the carousel work that's gonna be the real test of whether this part is there or not Nope that's that's not working that's not even close to working Okay it's clearly very rough around the edges Yeah I knew that the pc port is rendering wrong I'm playing oh I'm not playing any romhacks right now I was just looking at the port to see if the port was there but yeah I see if someone ported Return to Yoshi's Island I doubt they would even get like close to getting it right because there's so much custom code I think what they would do is just port the maps with like wrong collision and then you can run around in the levels but you wouldn't actually be able to play it it'd be like a roblox port basically Just a demo but did you actually like port the gameplay like or did you just port the map that's what I'm asking here Really? So you have like the boss fights too? That's pretty cool But how did you do that you don't even know what methods are I'd have to like decompile that because I haven't made a public yet No they're not using Recom to do it they're just recreating it Peach's Fury stars code oh but that's not the rtyi demo or are you getting oh you're getting the gameplay from the rtyi demo from Peach's Fury I guess that kind of works I don't want a dimensional why Yeah Peach's Fury code has a lot of code from other levels this is true That is a good way to get that from it's not going to be perfectly accurate but like it's going to be like very old version of it without any of the fixes Did someone port last attack to pc? Many people have tried no one has to see that I mean can't ask yeah but it's not finished and I don't think it ever will be finished it's impossible to finish if you actually did an accurate port of last impact to pc port you would find a lot of last impact easter eggs that no one has found yet because there's a lot of stuff in the game that like you would only know if you looked at the code so until he tells me about the secret hidden easter eggs in last impact's code I know he's not done hello clayman so I'm thinking for the yoshi boss here we're actually using some cryptographic messages that we sent the player through his text boxes and I already have two encryption techniques thought of but we need like a few more so well they don't want an emulator and stuff they want it on the pc port explicitly and a bit of performance and I don't make sense to me but I don't know if that's actually true um oh mpc port no idea the last time is 60 fps and some missions removed man I love this game but I really wish they would remove some parts of it because god damn it dude they fucking suck it's what you self-check so maybe like mario 64 showed it was possible and now they're just doing more games than that maybe Remaking last impact is a completely like insane endeavor that's just not gonna happen i think one with i know what i don't know where you run out of oxygen the camera is super cancerous i don't know what to tell him we run out of oxygen oh did you forget to pick up the frog suit maybe i don't think you were supposed to go there without oxygen or do you mean like the secret aquarium there with the fishes i don't think they're referring to personal case i'm not sure what else he could be referring to it but that that looks so goddamn bad explore the shell star in course three oh sunset eyelids what if i change the interpolation modes to back so we need this and then we need a ball laid out like this i think oh that's kind of it but i don't like that it's like stopping like that that's a problem why is it stopping like that oh so oh there we go that's kind of nice why are you doing a tentacle yoshi he's the boss for course 15 he's very spacey isn't he now in slow motion oh that's kind of nice i like that can you ease out the keyframes don't know what that means can you um describe what you're looking for on a technical level i had a dream one time that people were not able to say words unless they could describe exactly what they mean so like you wouldn't be able to say brown without being able to describe the wavelength of lights that you're referring to or you wouldn't be able to say chair without being able to define exactly what you mean by chair and what like another chair is and i feel like if we lived in a world like that our lives would be so much better a name for this level no not yet so he should be spawning a tentacle now and that was supposed to go the other way but the tentacle spawns oh that's kind of cool so i have a blue sky account there's something like then you're going from one a to one a or each other yes i can do that so we couldn't put names to unknown original things not cool oh you would be able to you would be able to say like dark meta because you could say that by dark meta you're referring to this list of unexplained observations ptx you don't know what that is but i have heard that they used some kind of distillation thing but i don't know what so there is a problem here and i've heard people use distillation as though they knew what the fuck they meant by distillation which would be solved in my perfect world here  i know what that dimension i know who do this  okay things are happening um what does pi run you're not going to be able to skip all cutscenes but you are going to be able to skip the level intro cutscenes so this is basically like graphic card assembly or what it's clearly not it okay instruction set architecture instruction set architecture an instruction set architecture i guess architecture means something different than it usually means here launch and then we should unmute okay so i guess it's like pseudo instructions for assembly codes like it's a set of pseudo instructions so for one this seems to be way too fucking big i'm not a fan of that why is it so big all right let's let's see this again with this gear cut they're fixed yes he's gonna attack you out of black holes and stuff so actually maybe the size isn't so bad oh what's going on with the texture there oh i know exactly what's going on with the texture oh that's not good i can't fix it why is it limping so much oh because it's copying the parents rotation when is the space starfish catching monster i believe or lovecraft's not a big idea oh well it was not the idea it was supposed to be a tentacle monster okay we need to do something about the material batching misbelieving in this case and it's actually very easy to do you can just duplicate this layer or copy i'm fine with that i'm generally just fine with that i don't care and you also need a layer for copy it's a slightly inefficient render now but it saves me from a lot of cover pain so i'm always going to do it second question what the fuck is going on here why was the second ward rotated it should not be i guess we'll find that out maybe it's fixed now almost making the sky gang nice also the animation should be a lot faster the animation being slow is on purpose so that i can speed it up later without it looking choppy hello neo nightmares welcome to programming the boss fights for this level okay that's sticking around way longer than i like it to and that's still the wrong rotation how long are you planning to stay bro brother yoshi okay it's gonna stay forever is it not so the idea would be that he attacks with those tentacles and then you jump on the tentacle and like attack the ward with the ice he's possessed he's sick and you're supposed to heal him and you heal him by like destroying the tumors here and i fucked up the tumors i know how i fucked them up so it's supposed to be like this well it can't just be one that has to increase steadily but this is a good start um this way only one tentacle attack at a time can exist and i think that's fine yep it's fine like an eye veins like a bit off yeah the yoshi model is not finished it's more like just like a symbol for what they want right now so now it is a good thing he he wants to get rid of his tombs you're doing him a favor basically yoshi's always friends in this game so by destroying the tumor your health is you know what we only have one attack that way so that's it's fine they're going past the other instruments which is not good what if i move this here um put the eyes down for my runs here she goes with like the mental of an octopus let me think about that i'm not sure i understand so you see that you destroyed the tumor die two more that's how you win the fight you destroy all the tumors and the tentacles are going to come out of black holes so it will look like pull-up and then you jump on the tentacles and you destroy the tumors here that's the idea anyway what happened there hello blocky this is a tentacle yoshi boss fight he's a pentapus implementing a playable yoshi is very easy i've done it before so right here i've done it on 2021 look at this wait wait i have more switch to my other youtube account what the fuck never mind i can't watch i can't go to my youtube account right now for some reason uh one second more seconds did nintendo kill this video ah here rideable yoshi on modem 64 look at this 11 years ago 2013 that's when i made the united rideable yoshi it looks a lot worse but look at it mentors the sack at the back of their head what do you mean by you mean these eyes here would like be on this side or do you mean like they are mirrored like instead of going like this they go like this i'm not sure i understand the plan here um there's probably going to be a rideable yoshi here somewhere else it's probably see there's yoshi stats at the end that are like green stars from our galaxy and there's probably going to be some yoshi stats that have you ride a yoshi somewhere the first thing oh i see yeah i really don't want that it's not going to look like yoshi anymore okay um why does the thing myself go they are opaque okay that's an issue these are not supposed to be animated parts oh the game is on now yes they're done well because 13 is missing the outside area zeno wanted to work on that she's been working on it for a long time now and of course 14 is done but a lot of the visuals are like left for violet to do so it doesn't look as pretty as it should be but yeah they're basically like both 95% done okay the graphics don't seem to be messed up why why are the graphics not done wait a second the tentacle piece here messing up the tumor still look unappealing as in like nasty or as in not well made do This should stop the thing from messing up. Still don't know why this thing is doing a slow mutation. Yes, he is a corrupted Yoshi and you help him to become uncorrupted. And he's gonna attack you with his tentacles coming out of black holes. And there is no artwork for him yet, I just made up some bullshit. It's probably gonna look very different at the end. Okay, why is the second ward so long though? This one here. For some reason this one renders 90 degrees rotated and that's very, very bad. The head is not going to be reachable until... Okay, I'll tell you the loop. The loop is basically, Yoshi is like floating around here at the start, he's like very angry. You go up to him, he says something in alienese that you can't understand and then he starts attacking you. He's gonna be over here and if you jump on him, he's just gonna throw you off. But then the tentacles come and attack and the tentacles have these wards on them. And the wards are gonna pulsate, they're gonna grow, they're gonna be very obviously weak spots. So you jump on his tentacle, you destroy the ward and then Yoshi gets weak. And his head goes down and he's like... And his nose is exposed. And on his nose, there's more wards. So you're going up there and you punch the ward and that's dealing damage to him. He shakes you off and then you repeat that three times. That's funny, Caleb. How do you know? Does it like show up on Soundcloud or something? I'm surprised you're so baffled by it. I guess Badoop is royalty now. He's famous. Like Gobblegut from Galaxy 2? I do not know Gobblegut. What could be wrong? Why is... What even is the mistake right now? Wait. It all works, right? Am I crazy? Is there a mistake here? Have I lost my train of thought? You end up saving him. All Yoshis are friends. I'm gonna show you guys something cool. So the last few days, a person called Akumoid has been DMing with me. They wanted to learn about N64 shaders and they wanted to help me make a good shader for this. And together we came up with this one here. Look at the building now. You see the reflections on it? I'm very happy with this. What about the dipshits? It's true, the dipshits are actually not friends. But yeah, there's like a separate reflection mask from the actual texture here. And it looks so cool. And it's a super cheap effect too. You'd think this is expensive, but this is literally free. This is expensive in terms of time that developers have to spend to pull this off. And right now Akumoid is working on the rocket here. So hopefully we get something really nice for the rocket too. Okay, next step. I guess we need to add the whole being solid thing and we need to add the whole being able to damage Mario thing. I think the tentacle might be a bit too big though. Let's scale it down just a little bit. What is this? 765815? Kind of crack. Kind of nutty with that, you know. Please tell me that was not the right number. It was not the right number. Oh well. That looked weird. Oh, I know why. Let me actually type this a little bit. 9.0.085 plus 0.05. It is literally exactly the right number. I should never doubt myself. The size looks good to me now. All right, it just needs to blank off. Right now he's just programmed to always go into his weak state after like everything. Oh right, we were working on the rotation of the wards. I guess that one was wrong. But it looks like it's no longer a problem. Cool. Is there any return 0 and see what does it mean? Do you mean the functions just return 0? That means that the V0 register is set to 0. That's all return 0 means. And it means you end the function. Okay, let's look at double guts. Hell with this guy. He's a Mario Paint? You're kidding. He's not a Mario Paint. Nah, Mario Wiki doesn't say anything about it. Yes, we definitely are going to end VFX and stuff. You know what, I'll do that right now. Damn, it should probably be like 109. I don't like this function. Isn't there like a better way to do this? There has to be a better way to do this. I don't want to pass the whole object on I don't think I'm going to do this. I guess not. There you go, we added a camera shake. Hello, I'm your cat. They're telling me you finished the last NPC part. Is that true? Still in progress? Next, the collision. So I think starting frame 109, this should be solid and not a damaging thing anymore. So we are going to do that. Oh, there we go. Well, but exporting the level has always been the easy part. We need to know about everything else. Did you find any easter eggs yet that I put in the game that we need to decompile the game for? Okay, use name filtering does not work. Oh yeah, there's many MIDI inputs in the Mario 64 that only use instrument bank 737 and it's very annoying over the course of the game. It becomes so monotonous. I'm a big instrument bank 37, Nathan, for that exact reason. I think a decompiler would just despair about my assembly program functions. Especially because I don't even write assembly code that is valid. Because I do a few things that you're not allowed to do in assembly programming. Okay, this is nice, this works so far. But I need to check whether it works from the get-go or not. Okay, I had feared something like that. Okay, that's exactly what we want. Cool. So there needs to be also an attack to this, where it comes crashing down and that's when it's attacking. And then you kill these, and that's how you make them damageable. There's also Morton rules written on the- yeah, but there's some code easter eggs that you do need to decompile the game for to find them. And I will not tell you what they are. Is dynamic collision- there's some dynamic collision in the game, but this one is not. This one is gonna be a spline collision, and I'm just gonna have to make it so that if Mario's in spline, he takes damage.  Which I already have the code for. Right here. Okay. Is there a dick level in Lost Impact? There's not, actually. But I have absolutely made cock levels. Hmm. Coctus erectus in the simple flips- yep, yep, he's played Coctus erectus. You've never heard of Coctus erectus, the level? Yep. The point I already mentioned- yeah, this is quite the goat. It's not nice to look at. You know what, I think he can do free damage. The ultimate's not at 5 seconds, you guys. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Double promotion? There's just so many people that have done the exact same thing at this point, I can't do it again. Hmm. Okay, so the funniest thing ever I used to do is, in some of my old ROM hacks- Okay, back then we had a ROM hack controller called Toadstool64. And when you open a ROM hack in Toadstool64, it would open up Castle Grounds. So what I did in some of my old ROM hacks is I would import the 3D model of a large cock into Castle Grounds. And not use Castle Grounds on my hack. So if you played my hack, you would see nothing wrong. But as soon as you use a ROM hacking tool to open my hack, you would just see a large cock. And I thought it was the funniest thing ever. Oh, these don't have a rigid size for a thing. That's a bit of a problem. I see Eggman's watching. We all dance in the fire. I'm walking through a spray. Don't know how. I see room extracts, what does that mean? I see Eggman watches. I think it's Organ of Matriosh. You should see the dig level in there somewhere. It was the funniest when I got a message about it. It was like, what the fuck is this case? I don't know. Maybe I just feel so fine. I imagine that you're mine. In my world you're gold. I only want to protect you. Whatever I want, I get. I want a shooting star. Whatever I need, I have when I'm with you. Follow me inside, outside. Through the stratosphere. The moon is shining for you. Knows that I adore you. Suddenly I... Did I just discover a bug in the score tier? Like a bitch. It's a bit of a shame that you can't get away with seeing those jokes that we get smacked in stuff like all our games. I mean, I got away with it. Nowadays the liberals would cancel you for putting a large cock into your omeg. That's the energy I'm getting here. 5-10 right? 5-3-1. Wait, how is the first one smaller than the second one? Makes no sense. 4-2-4. And then the last one, we're just going to put 10.5. Well, you also would never see it unless you hacked the game, so maybe you're doing it to yourself. What is this helium, I don't know. Okay, random guess. Helium density. 0.27 tons per square meter. Wait, that doesn't make any sense. There's no way it's that dense. Fuck, I have no guess. I give up. Honestly, this seems to mostly do the hitbox. That's crazy. I didn't think it would just work out of the box like that. 0.16 kilograms per square meter. That's like nothing. Yeah, I was thinking, oh, it's probably just a little less dense than water, but it clearly is much, much less dense than water. It's slightly less dense than air. Maybe that's the correct thing to do. Okay, how do we handle those weird situations though? That's concerning me a little bit. I also should be using the last animation frame, then. Some random in-between here. Okay. Hello, Chris Doyle. I'm doing pretty well. I'm currently programming the WashiBoss here. He's getting solid a little too late here. That's a bit weird. Oh, that's why. NPC blue screens deserved. That's what you get. Hello, Zelda. How much wood a woodchuck... How much wood would a woodchuck chuck? What's a woodchuck? Is it, like, someone who chops wood? Woodchucking means, like, hacking it up. I'm saying, like, maybe four trees per day. Are we checking if it's a Kukuk? No. That's why the dark floor is not finished. Oh boy. Probably not like this level here. There's no way a woodchuck is a cuckoo bird. A Waldmurmeltier? What? I've never heard of that either. Zelda, I think you're thinking of a woodpecker, which is also not a cuckoo bird. So I don't like that Mario gets stuck in a tentacle. Obviously. And we need to do something about that. I'm thinking we're just gonna make it so that if the tentacle hits Mario, then it instantly retracts. Like so. Like, players are probably gonna be like, oh man, why do I, even when I get hit, still get, like, the hardships of the thing instantly retracting? But they don't know it's for their own benefit, because I don't want them to get stuck like that. Alright, that's pretty cool. Oh my god, dude, how many people want to ask me how I'm doing today? It's been like three people in five minutes. I will eat you guys alive. Why are you interrogating me like this? How are you doing? That's like, my least favorite question. Because it's like, people being polite, but it's also like, pissing me off, so I can't react impolitely. You know what I mean? Does it mean retract instantly? It's because, um, this is still a thing here. So, I should probably speed up the animation after the hits, so that it retracts even faster. But it does skip the 120 frame wait time here. Woodchucks don't actually chuck woods? That's why the full-time maker ends in a woodchuck switch chuck woods? Oh, I see. How are you doing, Case? Ah! Murder. You know what? We're gonna get this a real variable now. Tentacle joint sizes. Hello, Dario. Pimple to crimple true. Is there a reason the room needs to be dark? Nope, this is not what the level is gonna look like. Okay, just so people stop asking that question, I'm going to add something bright here, and then you guys can be happy. How's that sound? You guys will be happy that there's something bright here. Let me just, um... Do that. That. We undo these. How's that? Is that what you want? Are you happier now?  We're even gonna do this here for you guys. I'm in the wood dimension. I'm just gonna use an Instancy, but can't ride it without a GTV, but then they do something when I hit GTV. I don't know what's wrong. The textures on the boss are not final, though. They're more like a symbolic representation of what I want this to look like, so that when Biowake remakes my model, he knows what I was going for. Full Tongue Twist says, how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? A woodchuck could chuck all the wood if a woodchuck only could. Oh, I see. That's not even the difficult Tongue Breaker. I could say that. Oh yeah, in case you guys don't know, Doriel, Aza, and kind of me are making a romhack where I am the villain. And I will stop Mario from saving Princess Peach. And it will hopefully be funny. The text is fast, and I believe you. How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? A woodchuck could chuck all the wood if a woodchuck only could. Okay, I had a slight hiccup, but give me two or three tries and I will do it perfectly. Alright, what's next on our to-do list? I guess we need to add the black holes that the things are coming out of. I'll allow it. It was close, wasn't it? There's so many Tongue Breakers I could never even hope to say, but that one seems easy. First update in Team Genocide. Do you want me to showcase it, Dory? Alright, let's do it. Alright, that one's difficult. Need some Light Effects, Chemical Bolts, that's the plan. Alright, let's work on the black holes. No, I didn't mean to open Internet Explorer. No, Internet Explorer is open. Now you all know what Internet Explorer was all along. This is what the black holes look like in Blender, isn't that crazy? So he's gonna make blue holes and not black holes, that's my plan here. What the fuck? Oh, there we go. Oh, there we go. So this is where the attacks come out of, I think that would look very cool. Do you want to have a House of Gump folder or something similar to block Zana from watching it on your PC? No. German is actually an angry-sounding language. I don't- I think people are very much excited for 18-bits. That's just a thing that comes from those YouTube videos that pretend German sounds so angry, but it really doesn't. What the fuck? Would a blue hole even look good here? I'm not 100% certain either. Oh well, let's export it and look at it in-game. Oh, there we go. Ah, shit, that text just happened in the right place. But yeah, Vertex can assist away 90% of the time. Does this work? It does. Okay. I think I'm looking for 5023. How do I just know these things? Something is crazy in my brain. They don't have better performance, I think. Actually, maybe they do. I'm not sure. Maybe it's externally better on the RSP. But I mean, RSP doesn't really matter. So, eh? Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright, now we should have a black hole spawning in and doing the whole thing. And then, let's model light texture. That's what we need next. We're gonna make it so that there's a light here going from the thing. Okay. Okay, this is either going to look awesome or it's just gonna crash. Hello, hello Simple. He's too cool for a purple dot on discord? I didn't know that was a thing. For some reason this can stop scaling now. Okay and there's some stuff wrong here unfortunately. All right, let me see what did you type here? Oh, I see that's an interesting thought Simple. I do like the broken data cache here the best honestly. Oh, this is what I did wrong. Portals, yeah so this is gonna be like the tentacle Yoshi. He's gonna have blue holes all around him and then he's gonna attack with his tentacles like this. And then they're gonna go back into the portal and it's gonna disappear but it doesn't look good right now obviously. I think it's going to be dope but right now it looks a little poopy. I think I have to make the the vaults a little simpler because this is going to be way too much visual noise for the whole fight. I wonder if something just like this works. I also don't like that it looks like the tentacle is not coming out of it. So maybe move it forward a bit. Make it smaller too. Okay, now it's too small. It's also missing the light which is concerning. Why is the light missing? There's supposed to be a light shining onto Mario when this happens. Yeah, no lights.  Hmm. Have you guys played Super Mario Party Jamboree? The game's actually such a banger. I would say it might be my favorite Mario Party game. Oh! No, the light does work! It's just very faint. Did you see that? See right here on Mario's face? The light? It's there right now? And then it disappeared. Okay, so it's working, it's just too subtle to work as an effective warning. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.   Hmm. Zero points one to five. Okay. How do we make a better light coming out of it? How about just like a large semi-transparent big plane? It's also coming out too fast, I think. Other than that, it's starting to look decent. Oh, and it's clipping into the wall. That's an easy fix, though. The problem with a large semi-transparent surface is that it might clip into the floor. Well, okay, what you're not seeing right now is, um, it's just a floating Yoshi face, but in the final, there's going to be an octopus body below him, and there's gonna be five So we do know they always spawn 400 coordinates off the ground, so we could make a light keg that just pretends there's 400 coordinates below. Like so. Yes, he's a pentapus! I've been saying that the whole time too. Did I call him octopus? If so, then chat corrupted me. Chat kept calling him an octopus. He is supposed to be a pentapus. And he's going to leave cryptic messages for you as well, that hopefully no one figures out until much longer after release. I think Shane did one shakeout here. Yeah, pentapus is 100% the intention. Do not let anyone lie to you. Not even me. I'm fine if it's not perfectly 3D modelled here, like it can be an approximation, I think. I don't know. Hmm. That's kind of how lights work, right? They become whiter to the outside? Oops. Maybe I should have cut this first. Let's see how this goes. Will he drop the lore? What lore? Oh, so he's originally been a Yoshi, but he's been mutated to assemble up with each other, but he has firearms like a starfish. Yeah, so basically this is a space civilization. This has gone away from humanity like maybe 60 years ago. And I guess there's Yoshis in space too. Okay, the light is there, but it's not looking very good right now. And I know why. Definitely not supposed to be full opacity.  The main part of this is that I can see it from here. At least I hope. Like, we want to be able to see where this is coming from before it's actually hitting Mario. But man, this looks ass. I don't like this light at all. That light looks super bad. Hmm. I don't think that's the right move. Hmm. Am I calling them the ascension caps? I don't think they'd work in a vacuum. Hmm. Maybe a mad scientist made them. Because they were fans of monster movies. I haven't given it that much thought. We could make this a much more narrow shine maybe. Like so. I agree it would be cooler if there was a good lore reason why he exists. But I don't think them not being one is a deal-breaker, basically. Hmm. Hello, Aroma. You know what Mario 64 gods look like? Oh, god. Just me. I see. Hello, welcome to the stream. In some fields it's a bit different using only 60% of your power. In this game it's only 60% of your power. Okay, this kind of works, but it's still weird. Oh, and I don't see the thing being spawned from behind me. That's a big problem. That's the whole point we ended the light. Oh, I know why I couldn't see it behind me. Because of render distance. Okay, I think this now has potential. So I will say the light doesn't make 100% physical sense. But we need this to exist to be able to tell what's going on. Hello, Tea Time. How much money goes into these things? Have you concept art or something similar you made for yourself? That does go a fair bit into planning about this. And there is some concept art for me and Biobank to talk to each other. And this is the concept that Biobank has sent me. What characters that stuck were introduced in Mario 64? King Bob-omb. Scuttlebuck. Lips the Rabbit. NPC racing models? Yes, there are some. King Whomp. Thwomps. Bombs. Okay, we need to add a column radius here. 3, 0, 2, 7. Working on it some.  Oops, that's not like you, sir. Alright, moment of truth. Can we see it from behind or not? Also, does it properly grow out of the black hole? I wasn't even looking at that. Oh yes, that's super visible. Oh, that's awesome. It looks a bit bad, but like, it's worth it. It grows a little fast out of it, though. I don't like that. Let's just double the time, I guess. And I'm thinking, maybe instead of this, it could be like a whole... ...like so. The whole thing like that. Let's give that a try. Slightly bigger. I'm a bit scared of making it slightly bigger, but we can give it a try. It's not a hentai monster, it's just a nice Yoshi who's just sick and needs your help. I think some forward motion would help to sell this effect. But at least now it's pretty consistently possible to dodge his attacks. I'm a little worried that the first phase attacks are too fast. He's definitely going to get a lot faster later on. So you have less time to dodge. But this feels good. And he's also going to need to be able to attack multiple times at the same time. I'm imagining him attacking with two or three tentacles at the same time. Anyway, I'm feeling kind of done for today, so I will see you guys in the next stream, whenever that may be. I'm not 100% sure yet. Yes, there will be other attacks. He will have babies to throw at you and stuff like that. But yeah, I'll see you guys next time. Bye bye!
