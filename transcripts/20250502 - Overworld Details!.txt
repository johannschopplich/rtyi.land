Hello stream! Hello in Cetacea Let's go! We got a new emulator today Look how much better the audio sounds in this emulator It's crazy Hello LemonGuy Hello Alexander So I think today we can finish the shaders in this part of the overworld And move on to the next part Just to get the base visuals right And I think we gotta make something for the corals too here Need something for this rock Hello Ditatz I was working on this level today I wanna get this ready for beta testing So we can ship it off to the beta testers Game was lagging What is the good looking? It's kind of sexy I agree That's kinda nice, the deep blue Kinda like it Oh yeah, I like that Actually maybe it should have a very slight bit of this, just for the texture Game error? Sorry guys, I'm a little busy We're doing some YouTube strategy on the side The picture of the baby with the big boy I don't know if I wanna present my daughter on stream so much Hello, who was that? Thank you for the 13 months, Skyloft Sword You've been here for longer than 13 months Must have missed a month So I definitely need new corals And I need something for the volcano up there And we need something for the cave here So that's our mission for today Yeah, 72 months sounds about right Hello, X, fear of darkness Are you scared of the dark? Don't be So this texture kind of looks like shit Like there's no nice way to put this This looks terrible Even in IA8 it is not feasible Holy fuck I'm not sure if you made one Maybe you made this one Just an old game attack You have no fear of darkness God, I love this song Oh my god, it's so good Hello, Naomi Oops Oops, that's the wrong texture Or is it? This looks not nearly as terrible But I'm still not really a fan At least it has a lot of texture But you can... The edges, man Plants, thorns and carrots and stuff Yeah, I'm thinking there should be a bunch of plants Around the entrance The colors kind of map Is it? What were you thinking? Redder? Oh god Less saturated That's kind of how carrots look Honestly? A faded pine now That's a very faded pine now Okay Hello, Pappy Prinny Alright, let's think about plants To put around the entrance So, bunny Burrow We gotta look at a few I want something more cartoony Like this is kind of nice But This is more how I envisioned it What if we put some flowers Over the entrance here and then some flowers here Let's look at bunnybrush Let's see if there's any flowers we can take Is this the concept art I sent? I am not sure You can send it again if you want Mushrooms Mel, hi KC Do you think using ketchup is good for making eggs? I'm still bringing that That depends on your end goal If you wanna Use a week of your life To just make a fun Stupid little game Using ketchup is fine If you wanna make anything That is good and you wanna build skills Ketchup is not fine Beetroots Oh, roots is a good idea We have roots in here We should just take a look around our level And see which elements we can reuse This Let's see Was it this? This part? It's pretty similar to what we're making Yeah, the plants growing to the side You have the paws Carrots in front, I like the carrots in front That should be doable Can you clip into some walls? That's because the walls are slightly slanted That's a bug in the Mario 64 engine You're gonna have to unslant those walls And make them even Sketchup is like a precision modeling tool You need to be thinking like an architect I guess Why don't you let me make my own your meal! Why don't you let me make my own your meal! Let's see  I don't think so Okay All right Is there a post for the Patreon discord? Maybe I'm blind but I can't find it Uuuhm It is very old But it exists You can just DM me on Patreon and I will send you the link to it Any OST wishes for today? These flowers are so nice I should have a flower field like that in front of the entrance It would feel so friendly and inviting Okay Yeah, the Patreon discord is very rarely used I do post some updates there sometimes maybe like once or twice a year that wouldn't be known on YouTube The Patreon discord I kinda consider like the hardcore audience where I post stuff there that usually people on YouTube I think wouldn't care TH PS3 That's a game Spyro Season of Flame Are you designing with game design principles right now? Or are there design adjustments? We did most of the game design beforehand where we kinda mapped out the board like this and now we're just trying to put some ideas in here and pick shaders that will look good on N64 And by shaders I mean combiners because when I say shaders people get upset even though I am on emulator right now and what you're looking at is shaders Tony Hawk Pro Skater Let's listen to the Tony Hawk Pro Skater OST You know I had the idea that I should just buy all the samples used in the Mario 64 OST because what if at some point I wanna sell the RTYI OST Are you gonna be doing Banjo-Kazooie, Slash 2, and Level Nameplates for the overworld? Nope That makes the overworld feel very gamey and I want this to feel placey Let's see My videos got you into computer science? That is crazy I got one comment from someone that's like I revisit this video every time I learn something new about computer science and it makes the video more scary every time and I think that's pretty funny That's a funny effect to have on people I don't think I'll get a strike for it but the VOD will definitely be muted which means I will not make any money through ads on the stream Bro, add a primitive color again I don't need to get all the colors perfect on the first try, that's fine because Bioware is gonna rework some of this anyway Hello SonicTheHedgehog68 I'm out of time, I'm going to walk off one damn night right back at you I'm a man, a man that's all I am but I'll continue just like any other can cause I've been down, I'm turning on my lead I'm only blinded, I gotta go back now when no one's home, let the TV hit sometimes I'm in, and I pick out my backboard and I'mma stack up and I'mma throw stuff in the boat and I'mma submit it while the wheels are airing all my overkeen and no-one's ever gonna respond and move the friends around, have it all together yeah and I can't seem to shape what I wanna do can't get through the game and I'm a newbie but I can take it just like any other game I'm a man, a man oh I'm just a man nah I'm just a man all my overkeen and no-one's ever gonna respond all my overkeen and no-one's ever gonna respond my brain my brain my brain my brain my brain my brain my brain my brain brain brain brain brain brain brain yeah yeah yeah  i m trying to find some flowers that we can stick out there too but i fear that this level may not have any but i know which level does have some kinda not a fan of this osd to be honest the future is wipecoding anyway you know what i'm really kind of looking forward in a sadistic and evil type way all those people that do wipecoding and they're writing things where stuff like storing passwords and security becomes relevant and they're just going to start like storing those in clear text bye This is a crazy lot of practice I think I'm just a gamer honestly I don't I'm not very good at 3d modeling I'm just good at hitting buttons fast like yeah I made this whole level like a year or two ago I've gotten a lot better since and it does look fine I think but it could be so much better I will openly admit I have absolutely no talent for art like that I used to breach into a sensitive database by typing understand work way before web coding was a thing yeah but I think web coding is gonna make that more likely to happen because the AI doesn't really have like the context of the whole thing and they just kind of assume you're trying to do something simple that can be answered in like a stack overflow post because that's what it's training data is the lava is bleeding don't know what you're talking about oh no I just realized we're talking about AI again it's over it's another one of those streams did you use research function this is a duplicate of another post closed what are you trying to do the thing you're trying to achieve it's not worth achieving post closed they love doing that to me dude I asked on stack overflow like once or twice and both times it was like yeah the thing you're trying to do makes no sense closing the topic or it's like are you stupid for even trying this closing the topic and it's stuff like oh when I compile under OS on GCC and do a multiplication it actually assembles left shifts and additions instead of a multiplication even though a multiplication would be two instructions less and I care about data throughput how do I get it to compile a multiplication and the answer is it's just like oh the compiler knows better than you topic closed or like oh you're stupid you shouldn't be trying to change that you fucking idiots what I want you you guys have no idea what you're talking about where you search the textures for your hacks do you make them tell someone or from other games I'll make sure of all of the above that's kind of nice I kind of like this I would rather get kind of wrong answers than most I actually don't care if the answers I get are snarky or not as long as they are real like if I do something stupid and someone tell me you're fucking idiot for doing that this is better then I would look at that and be like oh shit this is actually better but most of the time it's like oh you're fucking idiot this is better and then it's worse because they don't understand the issue that's what bothers me I'll randomize our plans a little bit so it doesn't look as repetitive I'm very much someone who won't respond to tone-off voice unless I think it's like relevant no way convincing that have I done this yeah so do you do in line ism them sometimes yes I did post on the GCC forum as well about the back they had and they just told me that I shouldn't be doing it anyway so man yeah I think lemon guy they just want to be assholes how many minutes of sensing a spot one what's your favorite color turquoise maybe there no I was talking about let's say you're multiplying by seven so there's two ways to multiply by seven the first is shift to shift one at at at right or actually just two additions so like shift shift at at that's for instructions the other one is you add seven into a register you do a multiplication and then you do MFLO which is three instructions but of course the multiplication costs like five cycles so it is slower cycle wise but it is faster data proof advice so the compiler will sometimes just compile that multiplication even though you don't want it even though you explicitly told if you care about size more than speed but it still won't make that trade-off so do you fix that you can't unless you change the way the compiler works or do inline assembly but I mean it is literally one cycle one instruction less and like three or four cycles slower so the performance difference is probably below a nanosecond so do you really care that much about that nanoseconds probably not oh that's the yellow at the green axis and there's so many good looking plants here oh what happened here why does this look so bad did I I picked this texture what huh why did I pick such a terrible texture it's pretty bad okay I can't listen to this garbage OST anymore I'm sorry I'm sorry you ever requested that it's too bad anyone got another OST and I can't wait for people to play the Mario RPG section the RQA I always see it's a pretty good one but I don't want to listen to it right now oh my god the red here looks so cool okay I think I just have to make new plans for the top part here so I'm thinking we're gonna have plants grow out of here like vines Freedom Planet 2 OST let's do that Mario Kart Wii, ah Mario Kart Wii is a banger I regret my choice Unreal Engine is pretty bad I actually do work in Unreal Engine at my day job and even with like thousands of hours of Unreal experience I'm thinking like if I make my own game I'm probably not using Unreal Smash Bros. Melee did you guys also hear Smash Bros. Melee in that song then this song is so Smash Bros. Melee this is copyright infringement honestly Am I even allowed to have mana at this act? Yeah, sure oh I this is why I couldn't set the right I forgot to make these you know what I'll never forgive in games for for not using matrix animations matrix animations are so much faster and they all just insist on using proper skeletal meshes or whatever and compute all the vertices individually in the CPU can't you cheat and put clipping tries instead I don't know what that means what is a clipping try this is something about the Tony Hawk OST that is kind of relevant it's like there's nothing wrong with the music but the music also doesn't like make me feel anything it's like so just generic doodling and I feel this was pretty much every pop rock song and I think that's exactly what you mean with the music is nice but not memorable said it last stream but the the one sign that a song is good for a video game is if you can meow along to it if you can go meow meow meow and like you do it to the tune of the song subconsciously then that's a good song why would you not want to use Android screen your own game what were you since that probably gold out maximations will just start a pre-commute positions right you can do whatever you animation was you don't have to do anything I'm trying that meow thing recently crazy how it's true I made one more person insane let's go okay so this is terrible I would say yeah these ones don't look very good we're gonna be larger than 64 megabytes no I limited myself to exactly 64 megabytes the final ROM is probably going to be exactly 64 megabytes meowing to clankers Kevin is some type of weird sheet but it's heat true you know what I have a webs and vines folder why would I use that I'd like a vine that like cuts off but also has some flowers hmm I think we'll find more in the plans folder go dough Godot I talked to one person that's developing for Godot and they have a scripted interpreted language that you can also compile which is absolutely amazing because that means you can test your changes to the code fast but still compile the fast code that is like peak like well it's  I think this is a good base texture there's no way it looks like that in the end it's gonna be closer to this what if I use this in grayscale with an RGBA 32 by 32 for the color I think that works it's gonna have internet so you can make a cloud version of this I don't think so there's another are you using at work the newest one why do you understand the hate for five five specifically to be clear I don't hate it I just think it's very performance heavy for unjustified reasons I remember when I first installed it on my PC and just the test level ran below 30 FPS which was basically just an empty scene that's like can't be like this we can make a less dense fuzz like that's not to worry I just think the pattern of it is not nice that's why I'm looking around more this might have a nice pattern I don't think this is a good one but let me just make sure can I straighten them all out it's not powerful yeah but I don't like it I'll set it on uni-v Biobak showed this to me just recently it has eyes? there were eyes in the texture? oops so I have two videos planned right now the first one is a video about bugs that happen if you spend like way too long doing nothing on Mario 64 we're talking about weeks or months and the other one is a video about why the Nintendo 64 was so blurry and there's like seven reasons it was blurry can I get some input on these? what would you like to see in those? anything you hate about the concepts? because I want to try to make a video that people will watch. I'll use a mobile forward renderer and check it under thinking you're a full HD phone and it runs with hundreds of FPS Ha hello Ivan12987654 Yahoo hello, Sarah. You've been here for a while Sarah. You didn't deserve that hello. Get back in line I Wanna sing this. No, this doesn't work You're watching me twice, okay, never mind you did deserve to hello then you're all good Oh Huh, come on I Think this might work as an alpha layout And then we could have second texture added on top that has some flowers and stuff I have no idea what those words mean about minecraft. I have never played minecraft and I have never modded minecraft Actually, I have played a lot I played some minecraft with my wife and How to explain this it it was weird Like we had fun with it, but They they added these like weird things that appear at night and like attack you over and over and they were so got them annoying, holy shit You Minecraft and save them to good People voted for those Okay, this is why you don't give players what they want because players have no fucking idea what the consequences of their own actions are going to be You Who enters the makings like I'll save them out that's why they appeared because we didn't sleep I Was I supposed to know I like this part of the texture Oh You're playing in multiplayer and we didn't have enough sheep wool for two minutes besides we were two people like The probability that we both want to go to sleep at the same time is so low that it just never happens  Yeah, I want the magic as we wants these ones here So we need to make the background 4d black and then export it again To 4 to 8 0 I think Okay, so something about the color here is wrong still You Some reason appears way darker than it should and it's black Oh I see She's all of you on this server go to sleep you can skip the night of Minecraft Yeah, I mean, I figured that would happen. I think I've seen that before somewhere, but that just never happens, right? So 2006 on this again 64 No, but I think I had one until like three weeks ago. Actually, where did my Honda Civic go? We had on the Civic and it's gone now and now we have a different car and I had to pay for it I don't know what happened to it. I don't do cars Okay, yeah something's fucking with us there's no way it looks like this in game Hmm There's more to it, I don't think I want to multiply texture one hour for my maths I Don't think that's the right way of doing that. Let me just export it in game see what happens  Which is detection that's going wrong 2 2 v 3 I That's not true to be free Being managed to the guys that an arrow occurs a big bit of discussion is pain. I Don't give a fuck about cars Cars are so uninteresting Oh Where is this texture You know what I can just add the texture to something You know what I can just add the texture to something Oh It's this one dude, I thought I had out to pick from it's off The out to pick from it feature is The thing It is in the Apple stuck on my back If I was an oversized buck, I know jack shit about cars, but it's weird. How pretty a car sprite is over making the streets safer Well Wouldn't you yeah people care a lot about their car looking expensive, which I think is the wild part Or about their car being like able to go really fast, but like you can never go that fast anyway This is clearly just some stupid childish thing unless you generally like feel like okay I want this car because I love cars so much and this is like the thing I've dreamt of like Like I think about getting a big plaque or in my tank. I think oh my god. I love black horse I've loved you since I was a kid. Like if you if you look at cars that way sure I can see it but if you just do it because like you need to show how Well off you are I think that's extremely extremely cringe But Also, your car is such a big decision and so expensive that this is like infinitely less reasonable Hello, let's go Okay, so detector generally looks like this Next question is why? It's not that Oh Is it because I made the texture so dark I Get many overflows here You Absolutely schizophrenic combiner here Hello Yoshi party And the colors look shit like this damn it Can while roads are already boring us out So when I'm in the car and we're driving somewhere I don't actually look outside the car Genuinely, I feel like my vision just disappears and then I'm just at the location Texture 0 alpha is maybe a little bit of a too high and multiplicator here So maybe if we do subject prim color that could help And we can make prim color low enough And that allows us to increase this a little bit I think that's about the best we can do here Then we can make this darker I Wanna see that looks way better. I'm like, okay And then maybe we should have to scope further in like so I get Karstic, I also get Karstic really easily. I select triangle on the floor once you go into gameplay. It's because of a bug in the Xbox program. This is kind of sweet looking. My one annoyance, the flowers on the inside don't go darker. But this looks very inviting to me. Hello GrafikTüftler. This isn't the only level I've been making progress on. I've been getting course 4 from the beta test ready. The beta test being me sending the ROM to one person, meaning 99.9% of you guys will not see it. But I've been making good progress on there too, and polishing up course 4. It's a christmas gift, kinda. No the plugin is written by community. I have like one ultra minor contribution to it. Okay that looks a little weird from a distance. No I think it really stands out and that's good. So just to recap, at the beginning this is gonna be blocked by Pachyderm. Zeyna did you end up making the skip button? I wanna add a functionality to skip cutscenes. Tell me what you think about this. So let me just get into a cutscene. I hate that in this new emulator the enter button doesn't open the ROM after I do that. When the game comes out, I don't know. So the plan is when you're in the cutscene, you will be able to hold A, and while you a widget appears, that has the fast forward button, and one of those breath of the wild circles around it. And as you hold the A button, the circle slowly fills, once you let go, the circle almost immediately depletes. Once you hold A for 30 seconds, or 30 frames, this happens. The cutscene just stops, and you're right in the action. And yes, most likely Captain Linkbot. Or maybe. I can make a note for that. I will make a note. It should be doable. Um, get the palm leaves. Physics will stand among them. With collision. It's good for replace? Yeah. I don't know.    Not a fan of the brimstone right now? It feels like a bit much to you? I like it. Well, actually maybe we should remove one of the carrots. Now I like two carrots. The only thing I don't like is that the flowers are still right here. But I don't think I have to combine a space to fix that. Unless I do something like... Should it come out of there? Wait, of course I can do that! Duh! Yeah, look at that. I can just... Oh, it doesn't work perfectly, but kind of. I see. Okay, that's pretty nice. I like this now, this is way better. It's the lighting outside in the mountain that makes it less natural looking, or at least surrounding the flowers. But yeah, the lighting isn't done or anything. There should be some vines that radiate away from the flower, or also the leafy plants along the bottom make things a bit noisy. Well these were supposed to be kind of like the vines radiating from the middle, so nah. Tough, tough call. But it's fine, we're kind of only doing the first part anyway, so that Biobak can actually make this look really good in the end. Our goal here is to throw together some shaders that work well, and put some ideas into here. So if it's not perfect for now, that is fine. I'm not trying to get perfect. So do many send them intentionally like they want it to be welcoming, not like they just made a burrow? Well, they are very welcoming. There's the annual carrot festival. So in that sense, it being inviting is good. We want the player to feel invited, that makes the guy blocking the entrance even better. Because then it's like, they want me to go here, but this asshole won't let me. Do you know what I mean? Oh, the rain in the ship level is genuine 3D rain in world space, and I like it that way. There's the guy blocking that half. Packy Derm! Let me show you. This guy! From Yoshi's Story. Screw this guy I'm getting in. That's exactly the thing. The guy's gonna be in there, and he's gonna be like, get me 10 coins, or I won't let you in. And you can either pay him 10 coins, or you can do a ground pound next to him, just like in Yoshi's Story, which will flip him over. And then you can just walk in. It'll definitely come out before 2030, I think. I remember playing Yoshi's Story as a dumb kid, I think, before I was able to read, and I think I couldn't get past him, but I'm not 100% sure. You can't kill him by ground pounding the hat. He has the stop sign. You can't even get on his hat. Okay, I need something cave-y here. Yep, he's exactly like Nido and Oot. Hello, Treevoxel. I did not write this. This is community-made. Why wouldn't they want to gassy up in their home to look inviting? What is gassy up? I don't know what those spots mean. Guys, how mad would you be at me if I took a gambling sponsorship on YouTube? I don't know why they think that I would take a gambling sponsorship. Someone is gassy up. They are dressed very smartly. Interesting. So, like a monocle and a top hat? Honestly, I am a gambler. Because even now I am still invested in the stock market. Which literally is gambling. Now more than ever. It's almost always been unpredictable, but right now it's very high volatility. That looks kind of nice. I kind of like it. Oops. I'm feeling so gassy right now. Gambling sponsor? Maybe. What do you mean? This is my general thing. If you make a prediction for the future, and you are 100% certain of it, and you are not invested into this prediction with 100% of your money, then you are lying. It's that simple. Because you have the chance to become a billionaire here, and you are not doing it. So you are lying. That does look pretty nice. If I knew for a fact, 100% guaranteed, that the stock market was going to implode in the next half year or so, as in the bubble would pop, then I would be a billionaire by the end of the year. This is fairly exquisite. We don't want to invest in something I have complete faith in, but I know I should have faith in it. Yeah. That's exactly what I'm saying. Especially when there is such a huge potential benefit as becoming literally a billionaire. Even if you were saying, oh I'm not that greedy, I don't actually want to be a billionaire, you could still be donating the billion dollars that you would guarantee to make from that, to the charity of your choice. There's people starving, you could save if you were so sure about your prediction, and you're not doing it. Yeah. I have started, when I am unsure of something, I started to just give betting odds. I think that's the perfect way to convey your belief. You just give the betting odds that you would accept. Are you going to put some really hidden easter eggs in the overworld? Yes. Do you see yourself making an actual IP? Sure. Hello Voisel. Welcome to the stream. Game looks so smooth to play. It is very smooth to play. I have fixed all this stupid annoying stuff from the vanilla game. You guys want to know how to actually get that star? I'm not telling you. But I can tell you it's not from here. Yeah, last time you saw this, it was literally just, you know, the geometry. It's the flight cheat. The game will not be bundled with a flight cheat. Should we only just sort of reach from that side, which we've been trying to get at? No, it has to be very clearly out of reach. Dude, there was a romhack that at some point tried to patch in some sort of anti-cheat, so you couldn't do that. And he was really proud of it. And then within like, before the game even released, someone found a way to get around the anti-cheat. And he was so mad. I did not patch BLJ. So what other shaders did I say we had to get? Just these, right? Maybe this cave we need to do something for. And this part is going to be made out of rock.  And I want to get some vertex colors for this area here. This shouldn't be sand. This being sand is stupid. It's just sand.  Oh, grass. Have you seen James Bond's Megaduck just demo it? Yes, I have. Okay. If I was any smart at YouTube strategy, I would make a video of James Lambert. But, man. My YouTube strategy at the moment is like, I will make a video if I must. And I must make videos to earn money. What strategy? What strategy? It's been working well. I ended up like, paying someone to make videos for me. As in like, the editing. I still have to do the scripting and all the footage. Saves a lot of time. And then, because I did that, I had to get an agency to find sponsors for me, so that I can pay the editing. And now I actually make way more money from YouTube videos, because I have sponsors. But it has kind of commercialized my YouTube channel. But it also means you guys get way more videos. Isn't that nice? Never again a boring lunch. Because you have my YouTube channel. Do you think I should do things other than YouTube? I have no idea. I don't know. Do you think I should do things other than YouTube?   I always watch RetroGameCon when I eat, so that checks out. Yep, most people watch YouTube when they eat. That's my target audience. Was it a high quality capture of the Megatech Just Demo? It's really neat to run on hardware. The mods work better on console than on emulator. Ha! That sounds like an emulator bug. Can you scrimdash in order to delineate the flower hole? Delineate? I can try them. I think what you're suggesting is a good idea. I've never heard the term delineate before, but I think what you're saying makes sense. That's pretty chill. Alright, let's see what you mean here. If I understand you correctly, you want me to try to vertex color this part here. So that when you look at this, it's less obvious. That does make sense to me. I probably should be changing the color of this too. I don't know. Something like that? Could you use a technique like VergeGemEngine with the BH cluster connecting to Bush Polycount with zero overdraw? I'm not familiar with the terms. Zero overdraw? You mean you have the drawing order dynamically generated? Yeah, I think there is potential there. Okay, the next is for what you're working on. All kinds of people. Okay. There's a clear break in color in here. Oh, the clear break in color is just the blender render bug. Because of the decals. So it doesn't matter. Megatech is possible. Perhaps something like that would be too. Okay, Megatech just being possible is maybe a little bit of a strong word. When you consider the fact that the one room James made was already 40 megabytes. You know, it's... This room here is bigger. I bet you would need more than 40 megabytes just for this area. And there's like 50 of these areas in the game. You would have to design the whole game around only using a handful of textures, I think. Are we going to meet characters from the level in the overworld as well? Maybe after things have been assessed. Yes, that's planned. Okay. We have a lot of that kind of stuff in the design document here. So you will be very happy with that. Really, the one thing we want to maximize with the overworld is the feeling of aliveness and placeness. So I guess two things we want to maximize. But both of those are aided by that concept. Ugh, this is ugly. That's better.  I don't like how clean this strip here is. Oops. Okay. Custom cartridge can make it work? Sure, but like... Like, where do you stop here, right? Because obviously you could make a custom cartridge that has like a phone inside. And the phone just streams the entire output of the game to the cartridge and the cartridge just renders that. Like, is that still an N64 game? You know what I mean?  So if you use any hardware that came out after the N64 was out, I think you're kind of taken away from it. And going beyond 64MB in a way is already part of that. I'm not hiding a PNG of a random cat somewhere. Sorry to disappoint. If you want PNGs of random cats, you should play only up64. It's full of them. Man, those decals look really weird. Oh, there's a backface coming. Oh.  The black square is gone. Please tell me that thing is still there. Fuck. The bunny footprints are gone, so now we make them.  If we're lucky, the black square is gone and the feet are there. Should I save my life just to be the one who ports Mario 64 DS content into Mario 64's engine? Why not just do it? I think bigger ROM isn't going nearly that far. Using some bigger cards and bank switching was no technique to extend the life of old consoles back in the day. Well, it's still going further than what they had available, hardware-wise. There's also the FX chip in Yoshi's Island, right? So are you going to say that that was common technique, so we should be allowed to add new computing hardware to cartridges? Because I mean, as soon as we do that, we can do whatever we want, right? Yeah, I already draw the line before extra storage. So that they fade into existence. No, we are limited on the combiner space, Ireland. There is a limit here. I have to fade them into darkness like that. It's the best I can do. It's a fast 64-bit player, though. Maybe if we swap off Lila's version, it's going to be fixed, but I don't know. So now we still have the cave here to go. I can't do anything here. Hello, Carl. Welcome back. Have you changed the water at all? People have been telling me the water looks awesome since before the water looked awesome. Actually, people have been telling me that the island looks awesome when the island looks like garbage. Something's weird, for sure. Oh, yes, I love that. Let me change the follow active quote comment. Oh, what the hell? I need more resolution. Okay. Yeah, like, what's the point at that point? You might as well just use an emulator. The only parts that so far I am interested in giving an attempt is anything Recomp can do. So if the Recomp can target Gamecube, then yes, I am interested. If the Recomp can't do it, then no shot. I honestly have no idea how much rewriting we'll be requiring to do on Gamecube, because we've never done Gamecube. But I would imagine it's a lot. Okay.  My goal is to backward S64DS content into the N64 Mac, but I am just a simple bender. That's why I don't even start. You start with the Mario 64 DS 3D models, and you get them ready for the N64. That will mostly be editing textures, because I think 64DS has some 64x64s that you need to turn into color index textures or, like, multi textures. Which is something you will have to learn, but you don't need to be a programmer for that, don't worry. And then after that, honestly, if you have all the models ready like that, I'm sure someone will love to jump on that. Even if you yourself are not a programmer, someone will for sure do it for you. Okay. Okay. I have some of the S-part of the N64, including a ton of program features. That's pretty cool. Why the fuck did my message about the emulated version get deleted? I have no idea. Do I enjoy the programming documentation you created for Mario 64? Yeah, for sure, at this point. I don't know, I feel like, okay, there's a thing going on where whenever you do something better than someone did in the past, there is the response like, yeah, but you're doing it in the future, so of course it's better now. But, like, that's a little unfair as well, right? Because now you're saying, well, every time you do something later than someone else, then you're only doing it better because you came later. That can't be true either. There has to be some sort of middle ground here. Yeah. Especially if you're breaking down the water pipe in Mario Galaxy. The pixel distortion in Mario Galaxy is probably... I mean, it's possible, actually, you can just do it on the CPU. Yeah, I think you can just do that one-to-one almost. Hey, the version of the emulator from Fnatic sent it to me. Should I make this the best format for my creation? Doesn't matter, whichever one you find most comfortable. If everything can be done better in retrospect, on my assumption, as someone who's never programmed, instead the OG dev team was not familiar with C. I don't know if they were familiar, or just kinda not very good, I guess. I wouldn't know. But yeah, being in the future for sure helps, but that doesn't mean that every single improvement ever is just because you're from the future. Like, there could legitimately be a skill difference. If you were saying Albert Einstein only came up with new physics because he was born in the future, I think I would be wrong. If he had been born like 500 years earlier, he would also have come up with new physics. He would still have been an extremely impressive... Actually, who's the other guy? Euler, yeah. Isn't he fucking insane, Euler? Like, I don't think it matters when that dude was born, he was gonna revolutionize humanity no matter what. We get like one or two more Eulers, and we're fucking time traveling to the past. Newton, yes. Actually, yes, Newton is who I was thinking of. More experience with assembly than C at the time. I'm gonna be honest with you, looking at Mario 64 source code, the people that programmed the C code, I doubt that they were capable of programming in assembly. Except for Godot, Godot actually did like really good work. Yeah. No developers can be frustrated by the high ups. You can't be forced to jump 15 meters in the air. Yeah, I think so too, fear. I also imagine when you are developing a game in assembly, in a team like that, you have to be extremely organized. And you have to be like extremely separate in who does which part of the work. Or you only have like a handful of programmers.  I think when you take combined time into account, I've spent, or I will have spent less time on Rty than Mario 64 team has spent on Mario 64. I don't think having a deadline really is the difference here. You cannot download the version I have, LemonGuy. It is a private version. Yeah. Yes, this is a very modified version. Yeah, that's true. Having many people at a project like this means you are going to trip over each other. And that is also very visible in the Mario 64 source code. That people were working very separately. Because a lot of things have been implemented multiple times in different ways. Yeah. No doubt that the original developers had things holding them back that I don't have. But they also had advantages that I don't have. Like, you know, an actual budget and more people. And but also they had to make the whole game from scratch. So there are straight-ups everywhere here. I think this has potential to look good. When you've been modding in a game since you were a kid, there's an experience gap here. Yeah, although most of that was in Assembly. It doesn't take long to learn a codebase, like with Mario 64. It's not a very big codebase, especially when you're also the one that programmed it. You have to keep in mind I only started programming in Assembly five years ago. I have programming in C. And my first C program was Mario 64 Multiplayer. It took a week to make. And I made a full Mario 64 in Multiplayer on Real N64. And that was before I had ever looked at the engine code. Because the engine code, when you're modifying in binary, is very difficult to read. It's a little unreasonable, actually, I think. I'm not sure. I actually have to talk to a copyright lawyer about that or something. No, I was not developing it a year before. I made the first three courses within the span of like four months or so. Development of this game was a lot faster before I had a job, which, yeah, that's actually also a disadvantage you have to keep in mind. I'm developing this game while I have a job, and I also have to make YouTube videos. So really, my time on this is quite limited. I think we haven't quite finished five years of development yet. But I think we're close. Yeah, I don't know if you guys know, but I do have a full-time job outside of making this game. What is your job? I'm working in Unreal Engine 5 game development. Hello, Jimmy. Yeah, I do have a child, too. I think it's definitely a factor. Like, no bragging, just being completely rational, I do think, skill-wise, I'm at least a top 2% or 3% programmer. Knowledge-wise, probably not. And I would say that, maybe I'm being an asshole here, but I would say that the code I've seen in Mario 64 is below average, unfortunately. Even though I love the game, it is what it is. Character scripting? The Unreal Engine scripting? No, not really. But I mean, the Unreal Engine scripting is just there so designers can do stuff without always needing programming. Do I have one good guy in the menu? Oh, I'm not Carnage? So you have some different waters since last time I checked? Have you figured something out? Um, yeah, we have some pretty good water now. I don't like these rocks here. I think the rocks need to fade into the wall. Oh, I see. Yeah, I mean, except for Goddard, I'm very confident about that Carnage, but Goddard, I don't know. Because Goddard has actually generally done some really cool stuff.  language barrier with the documentation is pretty plausible. But, like, just look at the shadow codes. I think if you look at the shadow code in Mario 64, like, yeah, that says it all. And it's not like you can say, oh, that's just not that important compared to the rest of the game. It's like, no, the code being the way it is meant that the game had significant frame drops. It meant that they had to try to do level of detail stuff. It meant they had to try to implement other optimizations. And they had benchmarked it, so they knew that it was very expensive to run. So I don't think there really is an excuse here. Do you enjoy working as Mario in Unreal Engine? This one, yeah, for sure. Yeah, I think so, too, fear. But there might be other stuff I'm bad at. Like, I don't think I have a very big knowledge base. Like, that's probably my biggest weakness. And it is because I never formally learned programming. I just kind of started doing it. So, that overwrote everything. Not what I meant to do. Shit. This is what I want.  Oh, that's kind of sick. But if somebody finds stuff on your Mario sets, maybe they used to have them at some point. Isn't having a job only a disadvantage in terms of time? Yes, it means that one year of my time is like half a year of full-time job time. Yeah, I studied mathematics. I don't know if my engine will become a new standard. Very hard to predict. There may be people trying to hack on my engine, but there might also be a lot of people that are like, the code is so complicated. I don't like it. That looks sick. I love it. The shadows are definitely important in Mario 64 so you can play the game. Yeah, or something like the Dire Dire Dog sub. That's also like a very weird issue, because it is fixable legitimately in like two or three minutes. Even if you don't understand anything about the code base, I bet you guys right now, you guys don't know anything about the Mario 64 code base. Open the Mario 64 decomp and look for a submarine. If you're a programmer, you are going to know the fix for the life, like pretty fast, as soon as you find the submarine code. Seeing the code is like 70% of the work. I'm not compiling with optimization, I can understand, because you want your test build to match your final build. I don't think anyone said the shadow code isn't important in Mario 64. I'm saying the shadow code is like very unoptimized, because they're doing like six or seven raycasts and it's like the same six raycasts over and over, which is very expensive and slow. Yeah, of course it would have been faster with optimizations. I think game like Zelda has a bad code too, since it runs so bad, not even very good sometimes. Yes, but it's a lot more forgivable. With modern hardware, what we're doing is we're trading development time for hardware specs, right? So we're just kind of getting stronger hardware and that allows programmers and designers to spend less time in creating something equally good. That's kind of all modern hardware is doing. It's just making it so that it allows programmers to care less about optimization, which gets us bigger and cheaper games. So there's two ways to see this. The first is you are doing gamer rage and you're like, games no longer care about optimization, all companies are so lazy. And the other way is to be like, yeah, now that we don't have to care about optimization anymore, we can make games faster. Isn't that cool? Of course, I do care about optimization because it's fun to me, but I very much understand someone does not and they just want to make a game that they like. Like, if that's your passion, why are we forcing that person to learn the ins and outs of some obscure tech? Why don't you just load it depending on the flag? Yes, that's what you should be doing. In the middle of finding a split screen, you mentioned it at one point, but I imagine the codebase is written with only one player in mind and would be almost impossible in reasonable time. Yes, your analysis is basically correct, but also I think it is possible to add multiplayer without it being too bad. And the way this would work is we just kind of do a hack where the enemies consider the player closer to them as the main Mario. So, all right, I think we have assigned all the shaders. Actually, no! The lighthouse! Look how poopy this looks. And the volcano. We need a lighthouse shader. Okay. For this, there's something very cool we can do. Maybe. Let me show you another shader that Akumoid made with me together. And maybe we can do something like that. You guys seeing this building here? And how the reflection of the metallic thing happens here? I think it would be sick if we did that. For the lighthouse. What do you think of this level, by the way? Biobak hasn't reworked it yet, so it's still a little ugly. And I kind of really, really missed on the graphics here, compared to my Dino Dino level. So, it actually has transitional black holes. This area is fun. Oops. You don't know how you can rework it, Mara. And the colors are shit. No, it's not good right now. Don't worry, he can do it better. Looks so much better pre-rework compared to other pre-rework levels. I think course 15 looked better. Course 13 has nicer colors, but yeah, it's a lot more empty, so I can't see the point there. Course 12 looks about equal. Course 11, I forgot what it looked like pre-rework. Course 10 looks about equal. I think that the mountain, the texture on the mountain is terrible, at least for the development environment. The texture on the mountain? This part here? What's so bad about it? Looks fine to me. I mean, it's a top when the textures are stretched, but obviously that looks terrible. I don't know how much you would. Yeah, Sunshine can definitely run on the N64. It's not even that difficult. Yeah, I even have a video here for the FPS on the real N64, no trouble. Does that look like an actual mountain or look like a cartoon mountain? Maybe you're right. Maybe the textures have transitioned to something else up top. Yeah, this is just a random graphic part, don't worry about it. But Delfino Plaza pretty easily runs on the N64. Although you of course have to scale on the textures. Oh, I remember this. We had to put the reflective texture into a whole separate file because Fast64 would export it wrong. Fuck. Yeah, I see what you mean, Ouroboro. I kind of agree with you, don't worry. I think you make a fair point. Although it is not something I can spend a lot of time on right now. What do you guys think will be the next thing after crypto and AI? The next big stupid tech thing that uses a lot of energy and people will love and try to make a lot of money off? How many years was there between crypto and AI, like 10? So the next thing we predict for 2031, so 6 more years until the next nuke. Let me see the visualization of Accumart here, so I can see the tech shot he had. Of course, it shows up as fully wired. It's fucking funny. Oh god. This is the tech shot. It's so dumb. The Metaverse? No, the Metaverse is already old. The Eyebrew is not really stopping right now, at least for the next year. Yeah, but we gotta get something else afterwards. There has to be more. There has to be more stupid fads. I too wish I was rich. I think we all do. I think we all do. Okay. Hmm. Can AI make good Mario 64 textures? I doubt it. That's true Yoshi right here, I think so. Also yes, I hate when people conflate AI and MLM as well. Well, I don't hate it, but it's a little silly. Okay. Hmm. That's true Abaddon. Hmm.  No idea what this is gonna look like in game. What does this letter do? I'm not even sure. Hmm. Okay, I'm thinking we might need a different material. I believe Yoshi light at the top. There's gonna be a normal light, because you actually do need to change the light direction to unlock a level later. Hmm. Let me think about this combiner for a second. Okay, so we have a base color layer and then a layer of reflection with this being an index of how reflective the texture is supposed to be there. So we could make this an RGBA texture with this as an alpha map. Hmm. How do you just isolate the alpha layer on Photoshop? Anyone know? Hmm. Or the inverted alpha map? Let me think about it. The black is multiplied by the intensity. So, yes, that should be it. Assuming... These are identical and they are. Cool. So, let's get this down to 32. This might be Zena. Let me get a striped one, not this. Why is it so ugly? Are the red stripes the same size as the white stripes on the lighthouse? Could someone tell me? Okay. Hmm. I don't know what that means. That's funny, say Ferex. Poland, oh no! Use it for text, no reason to make many mistakes. That sounds about right. Well, I suppose the question is whether it makes less mistakes than the average person using it. And I would assume not. Because surely if you are using it, you are doing so because you are absolutely clueless. Taxes are something a lot of people get very wrong. You still hear people say shit like, oh, if I make more money now, then I'll go up a tax bracket and end up with less money of my own. Right? That's like, that's the level you have to compete with. Okay. I don't want it over me. I want to make my game. I'm going to try and shape a mountain on stream while you're done after shading lighthouse. I'm not trying to do anything on the mountain for now. Wrong level. What? The funniest is hand grok is true. So funny.  Hello. Oh, shit, that doesn't work. I forgot.  Let me think about this.  Minus. Prim. By combined. So combined needs to be. At least. Point five. All seven apps. Actually eight zeros across the board. And then maybe that works. I see a light shining on it. Nope. The graphics is underflowing or overflowing. What's the extra opinion? Yoshi's Island. Yoshi's Island is one of the few 2D platformers. That's actually good because they understand that digital buttons mean you have very little fine control. So making it work in a way where you're like your acceleration and deceleration is really sluggish. Like you're controlling its rain. That's like the way to go. So that's why I actually kind of like it. So what the hell is going on here? The biggest creators on all of YouTube are all slop creators. Humans yearn for the slop. Yeah, exactly. You can do cuckoo. That's why I like it. Although I was very young when I played it, so it doesn't really mean much, I think. Dude, something unbelievable is going on. What the fuck? Genuinely, how is this possible? Let me just set this to zero. How does it look like that? It does not look like that. You're lying to me. It would not look like that. You're lying. It doesn't look like that. Am I crazy? Is this a song request? Okay guys, I have an interview I need to go to. I think what the plugin is doing wrong is that it multiplies the texture alpha with the texture when previewing it. So in game, if the plugin exported my texture correctly, that pattern is not there. See? But also you see how this is yellow? Why is it yellow? I did not make that yellow. So something really fucked is going on here. Yeah, I will have to debug this upstream. I need to go now. So I'll see you guys next stream, probably on Saturday. Bye bye.
