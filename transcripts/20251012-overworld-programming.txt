I thought it was I guess I'm just crazy Is it possible to have Concave objects Concave over a plane of water That makes the water plane inside the concave part disappear Am I No, concave is this way Yes That is possible Okay, the water visuals Disappearing is a lot harder That is something I don't want to have to program Like, yeah If it's a static shell that works I didn't up the resolution of the textures Nope Yeah, we'd have to do it with animated Versus, right? It's a little Worse on my end Let's see, part 5 We're gonna do this from top to bottom Pirate right now We're not doing this from top to bottom If you don't fall down While you're doing that part You don't want to see a seashell in your life? They go on the terrace next to trees? They're that difficult? I thought they were easy as hell Am I just a seashell making genius? Or did my seashells just suck so much That I didn't experience the difficulty But Wouldn't that Also cause The Depth of the thing? Wait, okay You're saying we have the water? We render the water last And then after we render the concave object We render a depth Plane above it, okay? Now Mario doesn't render when he's on the thing We render the depth Only thing on layer 6 before the water And after everything else, that actually works That is a good idea Yeah, Biobank, we can do that Actually, Rayman just brought up A good point But That also means that Particles wouldn't render inside that shell So it would look a little jank And I don't really want to change the draw order In my engine I'm spinning the plane! So far there's been an incident with the rusting bed Which is messed up by required order No But I would have to support changing the order In engine And any feature that requires engine level hacks Unless I want to use it a lot I say it's off limits Yeah I had a behavior That's a ground point for a blue coin that I want to copy Fuck it Let me just make a new behavior VFX and SFX work? Okay, interesting I'm sure we can polish the fuck out of it If we really want Some music What is this fucking song? This is not the music I was listening to No video Check out this awesome music I wanna listen to more of this person She makes nice music I'll just opt programmer Skip to 05.00 K, so I be a really easy setup Uhm, the parameter besides the ID When there is no actor with the next ID available 0.5 Uhm I don't know why I'm doing this He has a trainwreck that has a french politics? No Wait, let me guess Your president is being an authoritarian Steepest guess these days Yup One second, this might be important I don't know why I'm doing this I don't know why I'm doing this That's weird, who's giving him the power to just do that though? Like, why are people listening to that? Does that make sense? Oh yeah guys, we have occlusion plates in the game now You guys wanna see the insane performance that gives us? Oh god, I hope it boots on N64 right now Nevermind, I can't show you Haha Too bad, you'll have to watch for the keysclips video coming out tomorrow I don't know why I'm doing this I don't know why I'm doing this I don't know why I'm doing this I don't know why I'm doing this I don't want to play this game, nothing satisfies my brain Never wanna be alone, that is all I've ever known What am I supposed to do? Think I'm all the air than you Never know just what to say You get the feeling Tsk tsk Hahahaha You will be president, whether you like it or not Dude, why does this fucking thing keep appearing here? What is this doing? This keeps appearing And I don't know how to get it to stop I don't know what makes this appear How do I stop Windows from doing that? It is so goddamn annoying How do I close it without fucking everything up? This then? Then multitasking And undick the box of show snip layouts when I hover over the maximize button Huh? You know what, fuck you, fuck you Windows The less you do the better I wanna party, baby can you touch me? I think I'm in love with you tonight I can't promise nothing I'm just feeling something when I look at your anime eyes Kinda nice that this works I already had the function meet Yeah, I'm gonna download Windows 10 Well, the problem with Windows 10 is that security support for it is gonna stop soon And the problem with Linux is that I need Windows for my work So, I'm fucked Also, and this is the thing that's turning me off from Linux the most The people that use Linux It feels like every person that uses Linux is annoying as fuck I just do not want to be part of that I'm half saying this because I mean it and I'm half saying it because I wish that Linux people just shut the fuck up We actually don't need an interaction box What about Mac? Mac people would never admit to using Mac, we're good I wish I could just disappear Cause I'm too tired to be Silly girl inside my brain Leave me alone for a day Tired of these silly thoughts Wish they would just go away Where do I put all the words That only make me feel worse I don't like reality Can't pick what to watch on TV Hello Autodeduct Nah, you just only hear about the annoying ones because they're the loudest I know, that's why I'm saying it feels like that It's completely survivorship bias I know that But also, to be fair Every person that I know that uses Linux is being annoying about it Probably I know about it because they were being annoying about it But it's still like, I don't know a person that uses Linux and it's not annoying about it When you use macOS, that's very surprising to me I thought you can't do anything on macOS Cause baby, I'm so fucking high I'm not alive, that's all a lie I lost myself inside my mind My mind, but I never reply Cause baby, I'm so fucking high I'll be honest, I don't know what itsunix means It's meaningless to me I'm stuck in two parallel dimensions Where my dreams have all come true I'm tired of existing in a world that feels so blue Why is my body resisting everything I want to do? I feel like I'm supersized All girls in the world and all of its minds Bite into my skin to gouge my eyes Everything's become clear, heart frozen like ice I could just sing to this parallel dimension I still think of you, but did I ever mention I'm not from this realm, do you feel all of this tension? Trapped inside our earth and I'm stuck in this tension I could just sing to this parallel dimension I still think of you, but did I ever mention I'm not from this realm, do you feel all of this tension? Trapped inside our earth and I'm stuck in this tension Feel my mind fade into my reflection I'll let you back in I'll let you back in I'll let you back in I had to try mac before at university and I hated it I don't even know why Honestly, I think someone just put the mouse setting on all the mac devices To like 50% speed and that's why all of them were unusable I feel like I'm supersized All girls in the world and all of its minds Bite into my skin to gouge my eyes Everything's become clear, heart frozen like ice About linux people being annoying being the reason that I don't use linux I just want the people that use linux to not be so annoying I'm manipulating public discourse by being facetious This should work now I have to use a comment line bozo Bro, I have this open on every stream ever Who's they? And why did they do it? The industry How cool is that? This is not supposed to be something that players figure out This is just supposed to be like a for fun thing I like it though Only works once too I feel like something's missing here Maybe not Did it spawn the sound? What does this do? Nothing, cool These are also all unused, aren't they? I'm currently trying to remove all the vanilla code So if I run over vanilla code like this I might as well remove it in a moment Seems to be some work in the future These are also all done in the industry How do the coins look so good? Dude, the coins are fucked up render-wise The thing is, the N64 Scala combiner can output numbers between 0 and 255 If you try to output a number like "-127", it snaps back to 0 If you try to output 383, it snaps back to 255 But if you go 1 over or 1 under, it loops around the other way So what we do for the coins is We kinda like re-scale the values in a way Where we hit "-127 to 383 And that gives us this range where we can overbright the colors To have them be glowy Does that make sense? Alright, we have... Wait, I forgot to look up if the sound even spawns There's no sound here Oh no, coin spurt No coin spurt So we need to add that sound here I don't know what I'm doing here HDRi kinda, yeah? Clamped by plus-minus module 512? No, plus-1 is rubbed out to the other side It's more like module 512, I guess Not like module 512 Maybe kinda, eh? So normally you say Windows has problems and they say use Linux But if you say Linux has problems, they say it's a skill issue This is true Okay, we need an OST suggestion YouTube keeps playing songs that I don't wanna listen to Maybe a bonus star for grabbing a toy out of the lake Is on my list right now Probably not Okay, that's the next thing we work on then So I don't think you can actually ever see the top of these clouds So we are just going to remove this from the 3D model This is such a high poly area Undertale 10 year dubstep remix OST? Okay Wait, this is the anime remix Where's the dubstep one? Is it this? Is it this? Okay So I think we want them to be like dark storm clouds first What the fuck does PrimitiveColor do in this? Okay Am I insane? What is going on? The vans that I wreck look so eatable You're gonna see them and take a bite out of the screen It is supposed to have a cotton candy aesthetic What did you guys think of the new video today? You've watched the video, right? I like that I like that that's good You know what I'm wondering? It will be so good once I'm done otherwise I'm going to cry from nostalgia It's going to be so good with your floating stuff idea Okay We're listening to the 10 year anniversary dubstep remix Okay So now with this setup we can have stormy clouds here And then What the fuck Oh I'm using combine color alpha What have I done here? Okay The dark and evil It is supposed to be dark and evil for now So that's all good I just clearly fucked something up on this So okay now we can do this This is going to be what it looks like before you beat the thunder like you do Where it's like the clouds are dark and evil And then after you beat them we can make them brighter like so These clouds are not like the final versions I'm sure biobank is going to make them look a lot nicer But we need something we can put here for now and animate already Once the ice cap rework is done All of overworld 1 except for the actual overworld is going to be done reworked Yeah it sounded like you were going to change that a lot But that's fine It's not like the gameplay in the ice cap area was super thought out or anything Actually Now that I think about it maybe this is a terrible way of handling it I don't edit my videos I pay someone to do it Okay thinking about it again What if instead of this we used clouds as a background You could use the clouds from the course 5 level And just put them there And then have them disappear after you beat the thunder like you do Honestly I have no idea how they do it either My editing process used to take ages too Do you think about having a pearl or shell on the whale spot So that Mario can use them and then if there's no pearl or shell You need the ice cap to stand on the stream That is doable yes It's kind of a cute idea I'm just not a fan of giving myself more work now I don't know if this video is doing R4 This is not doing numbers We need a different title or something This is the best thumbnail So I'm thinking of using these storm clouds here I don't think that's a good idea You weren't notified about it? That really sucks This is not the part of the background I wanted That is... Snaplin is starting my resets and arranging them into layouts? Really? That's what the setting is? God, I hate this OS Wait, I know why the views are like that It's because of that ad blocker change My YouTube managers have told me The Shadow Elite in the background of Case Emmanuel has told me about this Honestly, what about Nate? What is Nate doing here? What is Nate doing? Cool, so... This will look like a page turner New schagok社 Wait... Now I'm upset I'm sorry So I'm thinking of a background kinda like this, maybe with different colors And then the clouds just disappear You can delay all of Tetris and the sound effect in Mario 64, that's a bit too long Mario 64's sound engine is better than the game itself, that's kind of a good one Do that, Mario 64's sound engine is better than the game itself It's such a stupid title Lock it in The engineer is supposed to overdo it? I mean it is true, you can't play all of Tetris and Mario 64's sound engine, that's not even overdoing it, that's literally just facts Yeah Hello Keaton The question is what exactly do we do here? So we need to push this with the NPG render matrix Meaning a render matrix that attaches at the right point But we can't obviously move the actor there We can make a new GeoASM function that only executes while you don't have the star It's probably the easiest way to do it Yeah we'll do that Stop learning Python and start coding in Microsoft Audio Engine now! Dude imagine going back to 2013 and uploading an m64 That's just a virus that uses the m64 audio format to escape containment into the game itself And then from the game itself it uses the project64 arbitrary code execution bug to escape containment into your computer And then it uses your computer to mine bitcoin You would be so rich I'm just saying you could have used Mario 64 hacking to become a billionaire and you didn't It's relative location is set to 0, that was literally the purpose of what I did just now I still haven't implemented the selection algorithm for it I wanna make a thing where it can pick a plane from a cuboid And it's not working correctly yet, I can show you what I have This would be a good task to outsource actually Look at this, the os is where the vertices of the occlusion plane are So there is an occlusion plane inside this temple here Which means anything behind this occlusion plane is not going to render on real m64 It will render on emulator but not on m64 The problem is this doesn't seem to pick the smallest possible plane Or the one closest to the camera Like if I'm here, the plane picks way too far into the thing You see that? And it's not in front of the camera either Like now it's behind the camera So my occlusion cuboid is not quite working yet Also here it should get closer to the camera again, but it's not But it works in course 1 Well, currently in the overworld it doesn't work correctly But once I fix that I would have been able to show you You can do whatever you want with the occlusion plane You can supply one occlusion plane to the microcode How you get this occlusion plane is completely up to you And I decided to implement it in a way where we have planes That we can put with like 4 actors We have cuboids that we can put with like 2 actors You know, one on each end Then I also have a plan for a second occlusion plane We can put like 2 actors, one on each end Then I also have a plan for a cylinder Where we can have the bottom of a cylinder and the top of a cylinder And you can skew it like this too And it will always find the biggest occlusion plane Or the most valuable occlusion plane there This is so surreal I'm glad you enjoy it That's a global superfinefit While any triangle behind it doesn't render So that obviously has amazing performance benefits Because we skip a lot of triangles No render buffer undeclared Do we not have rendering breath mode in here? We do No render buffer undeclared Do we not have rendering breath mode in here? We do Node undeclared? Makes sense Well, we don't actually need it It should be here Do you have an uplift delta and testing it? Well, that obviously depends on your use case In course 1 it was around a 5% improvement But course 1 is not a level that is made for it I imagine that the improvement in a level like course 2 is going to be much higher Did I not copy the whole path? What the fuck Hello Zelda Is it DVD? Yes And then Lightest rumble is ID 1 Alright, we now should have the clouds render in that overworld part The question is where I didn't sense What did I not do? Do I have to star? Is that the issue? Oh my god, I just realized one huge issue Oh nevermind, it's going to be on the map All good I might have to star For a second I thought we forgot to put a way into the game to check your progress in each level But no, that's going to be in the map from the password Also, this looks pretty cool now It really does look like it's going to send you back to the past To the cool games That do not suck ass I do not give a fuck That's my take Oh yeah Oh yeah, what do you think of my bamboo biobank? Is it good bamboo? It's all using one texture, isn't that nice? And it can be used from bamboo walls It's a very versatile texture Look, I'm listening to the OST that you told me to put on Seamless loop? Okay, it's 9 minutes Maybe we need a different OST then Geotranslate note 5000? What the fuck? Why is there a translate note by 5000 here randomly? I didn't do that Some bizarre stuff You don't know if you like treebus? Don't worry, we're going to improve it at some point Zimbabwe went like 7 years ago for the biopack? Really? I had no idea Geometry 009? Geometry 009 Mesh Layer 5 is the one with the translate note Geometry 009? Doesn't even exist Oh, wait, I lied Oh, of course I'm not confident that this will now cause this to render correctly Geometry 009 Mesh Layer 5 Hello every, it is you Hello you Geometry 009 Mesh Layer 5 Okay, so the function is being executed It's still not rendering this thing Unless it is rendering it Behind the other backgrounds That's what it's doing 19 Now we've got it, I think See, it was rendering this first and then this over that So that's why it didn't work But this is transparent, so if you render this next, the one below it is still going to look fine Geometry 009 Mesh Layer 5 Okay, it does look kind of stormy, I like that We did want this How does it look up close? Or as up close as it can be Geometry 009 Mesh Layer 5 Yeah, I think this has the desired effect That looks like there's trouble brewing over there Then as soon as you have to start it, it will all disappear Geometry 009 Mesh Layer 5 That's true, this OST is quite extended Do we have any other OST suggestions? Geometry 009 Mesh Layer 5 Chill NintendoJs, no Geometry 009 Mesh Layer 5 Is this not what you hear in-game when you play the game? Or does it just not loop that much? Angry NintendoJs, okay Angry NintendoJs Angry Nintendo Music Angry Nintendo Music It's all angry video game nerd Angry Nintendo Music Angry Nintendo Music I found the funniest Let's Player of all time yesterday How do I... There's no good way to show this to you guys You're just going to miss out, I'm sorry I'm just going to keep this game to myself It gets like 20 views per video 30 minutes of agonizing Nintendo Worst music Yeah Yeah He's Let's Playing video games And every 10 seconds he says something and then goes And every one of his videos is like this Like for the last 7 years back Every 10 seconds he goes It's awesome I'm not telling you the channel link I was watching one video because it was recommended And he was doing like a very difficult gameplay for us Like holy shit he did that, I wanna watch that And like 5 minutes into the video I started stimming and also going I'm not telling you, I don't want you guys to harass him He's my Let's Player Yes Yes, don't post the links, I don't That's mean Yes We will never know, don't do it man I can't just talk about someone and then You guys send people to them You guys are just trying to make fun of him Okay Okay we need a way for the Kamek boss fight to work here Okay Let me think about this again How does this work, how did we have this planned Ah There is an evil block that insults you in rhymes The evil block sits here And here You can't get past them So There is like one part of the overworld You can't access until way later Wait is it there Or was it even further back This has entrances for 14 and 15 I guess Yeah this should, okay yeah This is the last few overworlds Going towards this magic Kamek area Honestly maybe But I think it would be more fun if it happened here So okay Kamek would appear around the main area I would say Let's think about the fight and how we can plan this out I know way worse Nintendo music Like the shadow fight from Twilight Princess The one that's just fart noises Come on Come on Does it necessarily have to be a fight Or could it just be Kamek messing with you I guess is the question too Woah That was weird We need another fight here Oh you're right There's also the pirate right So there would be two fights here One just planned is that pirates would come right here Well the pirates would be mostly in the latter half here I am thinking though that Kamek should do something evil to you And that you beating her should do something Or it could be that the evil message blocks just attack Because they're like sent from Kamek or something I don't know How do we best insinuate this fight I mean she could just come here Be in the middle of the lake and then be like I've seen you make too much progress Imma put an end to this Maybe she transforms the Yoshis that are here With her magic And you have to catch her and do something to her The clouds are supposed to look wicked Like they're evil And there's going to be tons of Yoshis here So what if she just flew around the area And transformed the Yoshis Then you have to run after her and keep hitting her Turn them into fish Block your progression And then she turns the Yoshis into evil message blocks That attack you Maybe they attack you like thwomps How do you turn them back You just hit her Like let's say she's over there Around the Yoshihats And turn the Yoshis into message blocks That are evil and they attack you like thwomps What do you do Does she just stand there and you run at her And kick her in the face And she flies back and goes to the next spot With the Yoshis and turns the next Yoshis And more and more message blocks run after you Oh They're pondering how to do the boss fight here Where's the boss Hammock I'm the boss Is that a decent boss fight though All the blocks are going to pile up on one pile Unless we add a lot of randomness to the movement Hammock just standing around kinda makes no sense Would it even be fun What if she said let's fly What if she said let's freeze your progress And then she threw ice at you And you had to jump across ice on the lake to get to her You're right it feels kinda weird But also It's that much cooler because it's already an area That you're in That you know It's so cool Hmm And then the zones interrupt the fight That is a big problem I agree Well she could just Block them off with like an ice wall or something Maybe bottom could be dead sea Oh what if she transformed into a Yoshi And you have to find her Wait that has potential What if There was a Yoshi in the overworld the whole time That's kind of an asshole And you later get the hint That Kamek Has to be around here somewhere And you have to find the Yoshi Like a little detective thing How do we do that best Okay so there's these message blocks And there could be a few Yoshis that give you hints like Man that's a powerful magic Can't believe the blocks Are still around Like wow There must be so much magic power Unless someone keeps redoing the spell And if they keep redoing the spell They have to be around And then maybe Like that's just ambient Yoshi dialogue That you don't have to read But maybe at like 60-70 stars Someone comes up to you And is like Hey we got word that Kamek has been disguising herself As a Yoshi And is in the village which we need to figure out who it is and then maybe like a little mission starts where you have to interrogate Yoshis. Yeah, the New Super Mario World texture is really, really obviously the New Super Mario World texture. That definitely needs to change. I'm just thinking of a way to do this where it doesn't fucking suck balls because we can't just put in a random detective mission like that. At least not without Mario 64-ifying it. Well the mission would activate after you have enough stars, like someone would just tell you or come up to you and tell you, hey, big trouble in the village. Maybe the village would be burning and that's when you can start the mission and all the Yoshis act nonchalant or, well, all the Yoshis are scared about it and maybe one guy acts nonchalant or something. How would players figure out that they're supposed to do that though? Which one would be so much work? We can just put a few hats on fire. We can just put a few flames around. By the way, in this area you can see me creating a block and turning it somewhere so you know she's around here. How would you see that? That's a little weird to me. Yeah, but Mario doesn't see that and the player has knowledge that Mario doesn't. That feels a little weird. Maybe you will see a cutscene of that while the Yoshi explains to you what happens. Maybe Yoshi tells you that he saw that happen. And that's when we have the cutscene. I saw Kamek turn himself into a Yoshi, but we don't know who it is. Could be anyone here. In that case we would need to find an hint. Maybe you just have to unlock a hint somehow and that hint tells you which Yoshi it is. Would have to be something like Poochie smiling at the Yoshis and being like, Who is that guy? Yeah, it wouldn't really be a detective mission, it would just be a detective setting. If that makes sense. The problem is we need to give the player something that immediately makes it obvious who it is. That also unlocks at some amount of stars. Because we do want to gain the progression properly. So we need to give the player something that immediately makes it obvious who it is. A Yoshi with Kamek glasses? That would make it very obvious. That honestly wouldn't be bad, but then it's like when you talk to him and he says, Nope, it's not me, you have no proof. And then you find the proof somehow maybe. But how do we unlock that after some amount of stars? Does an overworld event just happen maybe? Does an overworld event just happen maybe? They tell you that they've been turned into blocks by Kamek and you transform them into a Yoshi, but that's only because they're evil. When you're done talking to blocks, you can talk to the Yoshis and they keep saying they're not Kamek, except one who is angry towards Mario. That all works. The problem I have with that is that I want the angry blocks to be a star progression. I want the player to make enough progress in the game before they're allowed to progress past the blocks. So just the blocks talking to you cannot be the trigger. I don't need anything until I have 60 stars. That kinda works, yeah. Why would they want 60 stars? I guess that's the question. I mean, one could say that Yoshis have been turned into these blocks and you need the star power to undo the transformation or something. This is a weird Yugi map. Too many? Okay, you know what, that's fine. I actually like that. So there's these blocks. The blocks are like, we are evil, Kamek put us here, and we know you suck, I bet you can't hit 60 stars. You know what, I'll go so far, if you get 60 stars, I'll tell you secrets. Secret... Something like that. And they tell you the secret that one of the Yoshis is secretly a Kamek that turned itself into a Yoshi. That honestly is all the setup we need, right? And you just need to figure out who it is. ... And they're back into Yoshis and they're very apologetic for these things they were forced to say. That works. And I guess you get a star for... ...for that. ... Okay, let me write this down. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... couldn't explain why it would be like that. And only way later I learned the correct way to ask the Monty Hawk problem. What is 4 legs and ticks? There's probably many things that do that. Hmm. But I can't think of a single one. Wait, did the smoke not fully disappear? Huh? That smoke looks weird. Never heard of it before. So, is the number unintuitive to you? Because to me the number seems very intuitive. It's like 23 people, right? Because I've heard people give an answer like 180 people, and that seems completely wrong. Like how do you even get to 180? Do you just not think about the fact that 180 is a coinflip and 179 is basically a coinflip and 178 is basically a coinflip? A walking clock? No, actually a dog. A dog does not tick. There's a seal stuck in a sand bank and you pull it out. Okay, this is our next task here. One dog has ticks? Oh, what has ticks and also has 4 legs? I see. Clever wordplay. But, well, I guess the question of what are real paradoxes is kinda weird, right? Because arguably there are no real paradoxes, because clearly paradoxes can't exist, right? If there's a paradox, it can't exist. Anyway, but yeah, it's just one guy getting very confused type paradox, which is when just one person is stupid and claims something is paradox. Or wrong. Anyway, I think today's stream is over. And I will see you guys in the next stream. Which is... maybe tomorrow? Maybe on Monday? If not, then on Saturday? And maybe next week Monday we have a big birthday stream, but I'm not sure yet. So until then.
