You You  Hey cause if I had a cup of ramen that never ends and you can just keep on eating it forever Would I be safe telling you about it? I Said no, you would not be safe. That's an insane thing to own. I won that I might kill you for You got aren't you I working out very nice I Have excellent gamer hello, JC Fergie Hello, not so come unless you don't mind sharing the problem with me better because like We can be millionaires with your cup of infinite ramen Hello, Sarah I Think about it. You can literally solve world hunger and I'm not sharing the profit. All right, never mind. You're safe then You're basically paying me protection money at that point though, so I don't know that's really that good Beautiful song. Thank you They're listening to Chinese eurobeat I Know I'm thinking that there should be like some sort of concert hall here as well in the space city and I'm thinking it should be shaped like a gramophone. I Have not played me 3313 A lot of people have told me about brief 3313 but I've never played it. I've heard that people seem to like it, but I don't know It doesn't really seem like my style of game One day when it's finished I want to play it But people keep telling me to like play this version or that version or this version and like I never know which one I should play first You There's so much drama in the V3313 development and it's hard to understand what's going on as an outsider I The gameplay is more linear but the feeling is hopefully not more linear that makes sense I Think that's key the key to modern game design you want to make something that is linear, but isn't it? Yeah I There's going to be a space taxi to take you over here We're gonna make that I guess You That was a weird jump what that was that Also, yeah, we have more designs on the space Yoshi thing that we were talking about yesterday Say not or not yesterday saying I did some drawing This was her idea for the mutant Yoshi. That's the boss enemy here Hello to various So concert hall in space taxi I Also need to do something about these lamps obviously they look terrible clipping into the floor I'm gonna attach them to something else if I want to keep the lamps at all I'm not sure You don't mind I don't know can you What you mean when you're asking me that why would I know that Where else could we attach these lamps to? I See nowhere to attach these lights to absolutely nowhere You Maybe in the bottom of the CRTs, but do we really want that? What if we turn them upside down the lights? And we just like put them on the floor And then they shine light upwards would that look good do you think I I think that could look a lot better You The Sonic movie is good, but only if you've played Sonic Adventure 2 metal or Sonic Adventure 2 And you wanted a concept of maybe put them there yeah, but I think they need to be turned around I have been working on my next video it's god the next video is so long the video right now is around 45 minutes long it's gonna be the feature movie the first one I'm making yes of course Bruno that's the point hello devils I don't like that much the orange color here makes it taste a little rusty maybe movie works without playing SA2B yeah if you haven't played SA2B it's like what's the point of watching the movie that's how I feel about it here in SA2B we got the platforming for the first star done we're still working on the visuals right now I'm trying to like get all the platforming done and then afterwards maybe polish up the visuals a little bit I don't think that's true for every adaptation I think for the Harry Potter movies a lot of people like it better if you haven't read the book why is the color inverted when did I change the color hello oh I see when when I exported this wait what oh I see when it is when I exported it right now we're working on fixing this movie light here are we still pointing downwards is it pointing behind itself it probably is pointing the wrong direction now not that I'm thinking about it no wait that shouldn't hello all star music do some debug printing here make sure that it actually works I don't know if it's coming to me, it's finished for me I work as efficient as possible and that's really the only thing I care about so there is still some stuff that I couldn't finish for the earlier levels yet because there was something else I have to wait on first but generally speaking it's like most most of everything is done okay we're not going anywhere here I should remove every movie light except for one to make this a little easier I want an OST, not this shit actually I hate this song kind of what is this, is this HotSatOnline? oh my god it is golden eye OST that's a good one everything's been pointing up you may want to use a projector with a larger base than that maybe Joseph said it's zero gear? okay there's something very wrong here was this actually yeah okay I haven't heard that in a lot of sense all right that looks good Joseph said it's after Impish, right? it is awesome awesome awesome next we just need the distance as well I'd like this in that small place I'm not projecting a Mario signal, you completely misunderstand what this is I think this is just a random light yeah that looks good we might have to change the light for the stage here to see this a little better this tic-tac-lock, tic-tac-lock is level ID 14? how is it not? oh it is but 320 and 320 is supporting this let's see that's not working, it's good oh you didn't intend to fix the attack bomb we use that as a marketing kickoff we will turn this into Not Mario 64 and market the moon game I guess oh the direction is completely wrong, the direction of the light I think let's see if that's actually wrong it looks wrong to me hello Olivia welcome to the stream took me long enough to pronounce your name alright there we go, now Mario is being lit up by the light as intended they probably won't point us high up in the end and they might also look very different but that works what's wrong right now, there is no problem, I am programming leave me be I make it a god, just chill alright now for this, I want the concert hall to be like here and then I want there to be a space taxi going between these two this is supposed to be a gap you can't jump I might have to verify that you actually can't jump this gap from last stream, the Conker's Bad Fur Day clip is so funny it's like I look at my own shader and I say oh man this looks like shit and then as I say that, the Conker's Bad Fur OST just starts making music out of shouting sounds and it's the most unpleasant song ever that is so funny Conker's Bad Fur Day deserves more hate we're not sending Conker's Bad Fur Day enough hate can't we make up a rumor that Conker's Bad Fur Day is what bankrupted Rare to the point where it could be bought by Microsoft and that's the reason we now have Rare not working on Banjo it works, so that's why there's no problem hello official meme thanks for watching So, it probably needs a bigger base than this. You're talking about Seiferix? So, fun story. For my next video, I am going to go over all the shaders in Mario 64 and how they work. And while doing that, I saw a lot of the Goddard-related shaders. Goddard is the person that made the Mario intro scene thing. The head that you can control. And everything in there is like months or years ahead of what the Nintendo development team was doing. So, it is really funny just seeing that. Where it's like, this is actually kind of cool. Compared to like, oh man, this is like completely bare bones and it's just stuck together with duct tape and glue. It's interesting. So, obviously we cannot make it look like this. I want to make this look kind of like a walkway. What if we had like, glowing floor tiles here? And that's what you are walking on.  I don't know what that is. I am an art cretin. So, I wouldn't know these things. Here Mario, you could... That's a lot of work. Let's have fun with that. I would ask for his lashes. I see, I see. Oh, but most people like it. Now, okay, so. This is a thing with me. I like hating on things, but I don't like if other people join me and hating on those things. Because then I feel like a bully. So like, I don't actually want you to agree with me that Congress Bad for Day is bad. I want you to like, defend it. Yeah, the idea is mostly written down. Kind of set in stone now. Chocolate bar, I will murder you. I don't know what that is.   Do you think it's a chocolate bar? What is it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  I don't know. Your hate explaining feels like how I do it with my friends. Look, if you get asked 15 questions a minute, you would feel the same way about answering questions at some point. It could be something like this. Maybe inverted. You know what I mean? I think this has potential. I think this has potential. Eh. Oh god, no, I don't want to program that. Um, yes. So, okay. This is a bit hard to explain. Um. It's pretty easy for me to do it because I wrote the rendering engine basically. I can only explain this in terms of the rendering engine and model matrices and stuff like that. So it's very difficult to do this in simple terms. But in difficult terms, what I'm doing is, I'm taking the render matrix. And I'm just generating a render matrix that takes the Lakitu camera position. And uses that to generate the matrix basically. I just said matrix a bunch of times. I'm so lost. Thank you for the 28 months. You know what? What if I just show you the code? Alright, I'll just go over the code. And then you know what it does. It's very simple. This is called during ref rendering. We allocate the matrix on our heap or whatever. We make it a translation matrix. That takes the camera position. Multiplied by our far awayness. Which is usually almost 1. This is irrelevant. And then we just push a matrix. With our display list. So we just render from this matrix here. Can we bully current unity on real defs? That's really better than all I see today. And can run on a little potato. Free to do so. I am not stopping you from doing that. I hate when people look at my stuff. And they're like it's impressive. And then someone else always says. Oh but he has no budget. And he works alone. And I'm just like. I have no budget. And I work alone. Isn't that like making me look bad?      Making my life more difficult. I feel like if I had money to pay people. Then I would have a better shot at being a good gamer. That's one thing I never understand. That's not what I wanted to do. Ignore that. Why can't you just program one of them? What do you mean one of them? Who is them in this context? I am not stopping you from doing that.  I hate when people look at my stuff. And they're like. I have no budget. And I work alone. Isn't that like making me look bad? Making my life more difficult. I feel like if I had money to pay people. Then I would have a better shot at being a good gamer. And I'm just like.    I hate when people look at my stuff.   And I work alone. Isn't that like making me look bad?  I feel like if I had money to pay people. Then I would have a better shot at being a good gamer.       Double silly. Because it's not even true. Oh that's slick looking. That's good. I mean to be fair. What I pay him is like not fair. For the amount of work he does. But what I pay him is also not fair. For the amount of work I do. There's just not really much money in role making. So what can we do? Biobank goes over my models. After I'm done. And polishes them up. Brings a lot of ideas. And new concepts to the table. I think that looks kind of nice. Especially if we can pulsate that. Yeah Badoob is doing the music. I can't do music at all. Is this the game? Is it? Is this the game? Guys? Is it? Sorry. He probably meant to type something else. The game is? Oh my god. No way. Okay what we also need to do here. Is make it so that Mario lights up. With the floor. So we'll have the floor pulsate the light. And then Mario lights up. Depending on how much the floor is lit up. And that's going to look cool. And then right here is going to be the space taxi. Taking you over there. And then this is going to be the concert hall. Now we just need to make a concert hall. What do you think of this wall by the way? What do you think of the reflections on this wall? Yay or nay? You like it or you hate it? As in. My demo has camera controls. That you would like to see in co-op DX. Or co-op DX has camera controls. That you're missing in my demo. Yes. Now for the concert hall building. So the idea was that we'd have this path here. That goes to the edge of the world. Kind of. Yeah. Basically. Every. Request for a camera change I've gotten. At this point. Clashes directly with another request I'm getting. So. There's just as many people that want me to add a thing. As there's people that want me to remove a thing. So that makes it hard. To you know. Act in either way. And I think the only way to resolve that conflict. Would be to design a completely new system. But I think the system is already basically. As good as it could possibly be. Are your effects moving slower than the camera? No. It cannot. Yeah I have plans Mario. Don't worry. But nothing is being set in stone yet. I'm trying to look up and down using the C buttons. Oh I see. That's good. If that's too much effort. I'm not doing co-op DX. Co-op DX has nothing to do with me. So that's not effort for me. And it's effort for someone else. I'm not doing anything. I make the Mario. Position Mario's on the map instead. It can move based on anything. But it's supposed to be camera direction related. To look like a reflection. Although. Come to think of it. What if it also moved automatically. On top of that. Oh maybe if the skybox also moved. That would make sense. What if we move the skybox slowly. Over time. That would look so disorienting. Wouldn't it. The whole skybox moved. That's pretty much it. That's maybe a bit much. I don't think we should do that. Yeah no we're not doing that. French stand idea. Here's no light source. Light source doesn't make any sense. This is a concept for this one. A little bit of a weird effect like that. Nothing. It's supposed to look like a reflection. Of the stars in the sky. If you understand what I mean. We obviously do not have the computing power. To actually reflect the stars. I'm not sure we're doing that.              Ah, it crashed?! Hello Cerberus. Yeah, we lost a good bit of progress there. Let's wait for the shaders to load it first. But yeah, so the next YouTube video is going to be about all the shaders in Mario 64. And it's going to be such a long video. I mean obviously taking all the shaders is going to take a little bit. So, what I'm supposed to do is I'm going to load the skybox. What do you mean by scaling it? What does, what does skilling mean? I'm unclear on, on what you're talking about here. Grocery store, hello million. Grocery store. Hello bingus. I need you to be more precise with your words if you want me to understand you. Otherwise this is very cryptic for me, unfortunately. Real refraction based on pre-rendered cube memory at all viable on the N64? Yes, definitely. It would be extremely low resolution though, as you can imagine. It would not look recognizable like anything, unfortunately. I was thinking something like this, and then the grammar form on top. If I think it's very related. So for the longest time, I think was my just my hobby. But in 2022, I got a job as a programmer as well. So now I also work as a programmer. That's a nice glow. Yo Aza, yes, I'm listening to GoldenEye because you suggested this yesterday. And then this time, no one suggested anything. And I'm like, well, Aza said GoldenEye, so that's what we're doing. What do you think of this Aza? Easy. As you write my case, what's right? You're currently moving the texture according to camera position. But if you instead stretch it towards the sky position just a bit, it can hide the magic trick better. But the sky position is static. Either way, I cannot stretch the texture. So unfortunately, it's not possible. The reason I can't stretch the texture is because there is a window texture underneath it. And it would be extremely obvious if the UVs were stretched. The eat shit comment. I don't even remember this. Who said eat shit? Oh, I'm not paying enough attention to the chat. Oh my god, this looks sexy. I like this. Now I need a grandma clone on top. Oh, he'll need to shed. Well, had you been here two years earlier, I guess this would technically be a hobby. Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, this is not my full-time job anymore. So kinda it is a hobby, but also it's more like a part-time job on top of my full-time job. Or my second full-time job. Yeah, I remember when you did that yesterday, EZ. EZA. EZ Wazey. I think this is probably not a good way of shitting. Yeah, I see what you mean. So you meant to stretch the UVs more at the bottom than the top. At top than the bottom. But yeah, that doesn't work without some extra subdivision and without ruining the UV map of the tiles behind it. Okay, grandma phone. What does a grandma phone look like? I like this. Are you nearly getting paid for giving me a job? I mean, my YouTube channel makes some money. Just thinking about it. I'm not shy to show my finances. We made $940. I had to pay my editor like $500. It's $400. I mean, that's kinda like a side job, right? Plus, of course, Patreon. That's the majority of my income. From bar 64 hacking. Give me your money? You give me your money. Why do I must pay you after all I've done for you? Unbelievable. Okay, what if there was like a box behind here and that's where the grandma phone comes out? I think that would look cool. Base C, C EZ. You're saying base to you paying me. Okay. Yeah, I think this will work. I don't like that this kind of artwork though. What was that? Oh. I need this as well. I mean, what now? I hate pop culture. I hate pop culture. Oh, that's just a shitty gramophone. Why not do a good gramophone? If I could play this Finnish game relatively glitched on Android, I wouldn't consider consuming one shirt. A whole shirt. Can I pick which shirt? Yes. Uni, true. Easy, lazy. Do you know when we're going to start on the compact? Starting soon. It is usually not the case that usually I'm halfway done by this time. If not more. I actually think we were done in like one and a half weeks or like two weeks. Right. With our compact the first time. That's crazy. That's not real. Fair point. Yeah, but I mean, they're also going to be the one doing all the work. So we have no grounds to complain here. I'm an optimizer in the Amiga. I've been focusing on making M60K. I'm glad you've been enjoying it. Well, OK, not all the work, but they are doing the majority of it. Because I know I ain't doing shit. I'm doing the voice acting, actually. And the credit taking. Can't forget about that. Yeah, but they have to also like polish everything up. They have the most work by far. I think that's undeniable. I want to do that. Actually, maybe that's not so bad. Is it bad? Do we hate this? Do we like this? No, no, no. But you know what Dory does? They are going to like update all the graphics. They're going to make new combiners for everything. They're going to do the UV mapping. And then afterwards, they have to do all the programming. And the programming, actually, I think it's more work than the 3D modeling. I do think Dory is doing like probably 70% of the work on our computer. And then you're probably doing like 28%. And I'm doing like 2%. You think it won't come out? How come? I think Dory is going to do their work. I don't know.  I have seen CharaQuest. Oh, I see. Yeah, fair enough. I'm also someone who prefers getting this stuff done like instantly. What the hell is going on here? Why is it doing that? It's so bizarre. Oh well. Let's just ignore it and keep going. Whatever happens, happens. Okay. Why is this not symmetrical? What have I done? I don't know. Looks funny. I don't know what the name is behind it. Let's give some confidence to this project. Oh, you mean CharaQuest? I mean, you're confident because Brody is working on it and not because of what you've seen? I'm in the exact opposite situation. I thought, Brody is making it. I usually don't like Brody's game. This is probably going to be nothing. And then I saw the gameplay of it and I thought, wow, this actually looks pretty cool. That's funny that we have complete opposite reactions like that. I need to make a gramophone. If you want to make one. I mean, otherwise I'm going to keep trying it. I'm going to get it eventually. It has to be fairly low poly. And it has to fit the spacey aesthetic. I was thinking something like this, kind of. I think I might need a subdivision around here. Some Schmidts. I kind of like this. I think it's because CharaQuest levels up the same as Brody's and Chara's levels. I've never been into a Brody's level aesthetics. Well, yeah, that's why I was not looking forward to it at all in the beginning. But then I saw it and I thought it had some great stuff. Like the VFX looked great. Did I always say this about every game? I always think the VFX looks great. Maybe my own VFX is just complete dogshit. And that's why I'm always so impressed by the VFX in other people's games. That's probably what's going on. Either way, I thought it looked cool. I mean, the amazing computer science lectures in disguise. I always feel just like at uni. I love the demo. That's cool. Yeah, my videos have kind of turned into computer science lectures in disguise. Haven't they? They used to be much more just Mario. And now they're so complicated. Just because the stuff I've done has increased in complexity over time. I kind of wish my videos were more approachable for the wide public. So the next video about Shaders hopefully is going to be more approachable actually. Because it's a simpler subject matter, I think. And it's a lot more visual, so that helps. In this case, from something that's normally quite boring. Wait, what is that? What is this thing that's allegedly quite boring normally? Most computer science majors just want to be typing code. I guess that's true. No one likes to read the documentation. That's quite nice, I think. I don't like how these vectors look so completely different. What the hell is going on here? Oh, that's nasty. Nasty, nasty. Ugh, still nasty. Ooh, hmm. Not sure how to hide this nastiness. Nah, you never need to read a C documentation to program in C. Most C programming is just like English, but with a different grammar. Programming is just obvious. Are you going to give the building hair? What you mean? What you talking about? What if I try to connect this to this, like, directly? Would that look better? Almost done. I will hold off on making any drastic changes to this then, but I want to experiment with that. Good chance I will end up using your model instead of this one here. ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...    ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...   ...  ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ...   ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ... So this is my current debugger, kind of just shows the FPS, or profile, I keep saying debugger. And then there's like the RSP and RDP timings. And I have this now. So let's see, level is now in GML, GML is down to just like above 2 milliseconds, TMM TMM is on a different page, CMD, CMD is this one here that says 18.5, and clock is, wait maybe this one's clock, clock and CMD were almost the same anyway, and TMM is, here it says text, 1.2. We're deciding what to go for, I can show you. That's the wrong level. So this is the level, and there's Peach. You made this Peach by the way, if you don't remember, I think you also wanted to do the animation so I left that for you, and then we get Toad up there. Peach looks so cute, you made her! Look at this, this person is praising their own work, what a narcissist. And then here's Toad, you also made Toad, I think, and there's Luigi up here. What about it? I don't know, I don't see the point either, whenever a person is proud of what they did, people are like, woah what a narcissist. And here's Luigi, with a little bit of a red nose. He's cold dude, because he's in snow, that makes sense that he has a red nose, I don't even know if that was on purpose or not, but he does have a red nose. This place feels way too difficult to get up on, holy hell. Right now I'm trying to not get up there like a noob, of course if I wanted to go up there I would just go up there without a problem. I don't think a noob would do that, but he could without special moves. Bowser has to be facing forward, yeah. I think the intended method is, you go on here, you jump up here, and then you just  I need to make this easier. Hello, gecko. Especially since you can't fall down here, it's kind of silly that it's so difficult. That part should also go a little higher. Yeah, a lot of this level is still work in progress, but we wanted to look at the gramophone actually. Oh, I accidentally put two here. Cool, cool, cool. That's funny that this one's actually also kind of easier to climb, maybe a little bit. Front-facing Bowser? What's wrong with the front-facing Bowser? Maybe I'm confused on what the terms mean. Front-facing means he's facing the front, but it's like looking at the player? Is that not what we want? Anyway, flying car. This is a cool flying car. I think I want this car here for the Shy Guys. Alexado said he wanted to maybe make a PC port of RTYI. I don't know if you know who that is. I think Xcorp is named after him, but I'm not sure. Maybe there's some kind of model resource we can use as a base. Oh, you know Alo? Yeah, he said. Let me see this. Hmm. My idea was to make a separate repo for PC port so the main repo doesn't get cluttered with if-deaths. I would like to give it a shot to try if you want before release. Yeah, I'm not confident that he can make a PC port, but if he wants to try it, go for it. Personally, I am not doing shit. I have nothing to do with the PC port. I want nothing to do with the PC port. If I had the ability to just like slip my fingers and the PC port would be out of existence, I would do it. That's where I'm at. If I had a game to release on Steam, I would probably release it on Steam. Oh, this is on Reboot, a really good cross-platform reboot, but it's not on Reboot for that base. Oh, I see. It's the HackerSM64 of PC ports. Nice. People have never been able to update on PC ports, is this true? People are going to be so annoying about the PC port.  How do you want me to destroy the PC port? What am I supposed to do? A video essay exposing it? I'm just gonna like... God, nevermind. We're not taking this to the extreme. Oh. I just got summoned. Oh, hello. People were just bantering me about the PC port. So, perfect time for you. Is there something to expose about the PC port? I don't think so. But imagine how convenient that would be.  It sucks too, because the individual people asking you about it probably don't know that you've already been asked a million times. No one would stop to think and be like, hmm, has this person already been asked this question a million times? You can't even really be upset at people for it. That's the worst part. If at least they were justified, then like... If she crosses up on them, that would feel a lot less bad, I think. What size is the image supposed to be again? It's probably best you send it to me unscaled. But I usually import them at 64x32. Oh. So people are already asking you for a PC port, Alex. That's also annoying. Oh, it's your canon that MIPS came from Bunny Brushworks? I hadn't even really thought about that implication. I was looking at some comments. I remember when I see that. Okay, I'm like fighting with myself, because Bowser is just icky to draw at all, but I still get it right and about it. Game dev in real life? Yeah, but not since that long. I started game deving in real life like... Two years ago. Working with DS for Breakfast, if you didn't know them. Mainly in the Head of Time.  Do you have a race car badge? Why is your badge shaped like this?  You can hold it up.  Does the PC port even support the shaders in RTYI, though? I feel like the game would not render correctly at all. That's a bug, Sarah, but I know it's a bug. Don't worry about that one. I can't get it right.  What you guys don't realize, is that all these advantages of the PC port you guys are talking about is just them emulating it less accurately. You could use something like RT64 and also get that many FPS and rate-facing and everything. I don't know what you mean by better widescreen. You get the better widescreen with Glide and 2. So really all you need to get is the higher FPS. But I don't even know if the PC port actually has higher FPS. Does it? Does the PC port have hundreds of FPS? I'm pretty sure you can play my game on RT64 with unlimited FPS already. Okay, maybe not. Maybe the newest version of RT64 allows this. But yeah, I don't think the PC port can even render RTYI currently. I'm gonna scan to thousands. What do you mean thousands? Of frames? I can get thousands of frames. Look at this. 1600, 700 frames. Hundreds of FPS. I just showed you me getting 1700. How is hundreds impressive? You just need an emulator that can interpolate the frames and the RT64 can do that. That's all you need really. I'm pretty sure RT64 is the base renderer for the PC port too. So there isn't really a difference. The only difference is in how the CPU code is compiled natively instead of emulated I think. I'm gonna zoom out and remove the real antenna. Thousands of frames for retaining the original physics animations. Yeah, that's why I'm saying RT64. That one has the interpolation. Of course the standard emulator does not have that. Or does the PC port actually have a delta time implementation at the moment? Because that would be news to me if it does. And that would of course change stuff. But again, that's not the C port thing. That's just a different ROM hack, right? So putting RTYI on the PC port wouldn't get you that. Porting the frame interpolation code to RTYI would get you that. I think the confusion comes because people are often confusing what the PC port even is. Like, they think it's all these extra features that people have hacked onto the PC port. Rather than, you know, just what it says on the pin. RT64 rendering or being a native .exe file. Which basically has no advantage. As far as I can tell. Other than the CPU code running natively on your CPU. So it just interpolates. It probably does stuff worse than RT64 as well. If not the exact same. It might actually just be based on RT64. Check your DMs. Let's see this. We got... Oh! The arty with the sketch. That's pretty cute. So are we gonna mirror him in the middle to make him 64x64? That works. I like it. It's just running the game itself natively. Okay, but what's the point to that? Why would this be relevant? My code takes 9 milliseconds to run on the N64. Like, 9 milliseconds. And surely if you emulate it, it's not gonna be more than 9 milliseconds. Which would mean you have enough for like 140 FPS. Can we U-port? Yeah, that's a lot cooler, I think. Okay, so this is actually not what I wanted. Texture-wise. Hello, projects. It's gonna be for course 14. There's gonna be like a pay-per-view basically.  I need these steel bars with normal glass. Thanks for watching! And I like that. Oh gosh! Upstairs! Look, we're just using the game in a similar way to Nintendo and being used to it. Yeah, that would be fun. Are your custom sprite textures going to be also somewhere? Nope. Well, Alex, that's actually also kind of weird to say, because like static recompilation does that, and technically emulation does that too, just like at runtime instead of before runtime. So should that really be like what we're looking at? You know what I mean? Well, ray tracing is an emulation tool, so that's not really anything again. Besides, the graphics and PC part are emulated, so that's double nothing. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that the ray tracing on the PC part via RT64 is the same as the one on emulation, because it's also RT64. It's like the same guy that did both. So, yeah, the difference is negligible. Hmm. That's very futuristic, I think. Look, too dark, maybe it's... I don't know, it's what I've seen in this cut probably before. I think that's because of the general tendency to want to overdo the effect. You want the effect to be visible, so you do too much. And as a result, you shade it too much, maybe? I don't know, I actually haven't seen it, so I don't know. This is actually kind of nice. An F-Zero car? It's supposed to look like a flying car, but I don't think it's quite there yet. It does look like an F-Zero car, doesn't it? I'm also a bit worried about polycount here. It looks kind of sleek looking. Like so. And that's less triangles. Okay, that's too much. Kind of like that. Okay. I intend to manage my faces with the transparency. We're gonna have a driver's seat in here. So, okay, you don't notice, but there's a lot of story to the level. Where in the first act you can't really get anywhere, because all the shy guys in this level are scared and they're hiding in their houses. And then during the second act, after you beat the boss, the shy guys are out and they're gonna drive these cars here. So at that point you will be able to get around the level. And there will be a shy guy inside here. A guy named someone2639 pointed a PC port to N64 before Excellent Gamer. So that's probably what you're looking for. Let's see. Okay. That's it. This is the PC port on N64. I don't know if this is real. This should give you an idea of how efficiently the PC port is actually emulating Mario 64. Someone on Soundcloud. Yep, that's his name. Alright. Let's find the other pig. Let's see this. Alright. Looks good. He looks so young in this one. The flying car and the pig are not driving right now. True! Actually, wait. Let's find that one. This one. Yeah, that's very similar. What? What are you talking about? Haha. Yeah, Mario 64 was easily the easiest game to mod, because they did not turn compile optimizations on, which makes the generative assembly very easy to read. Hmm. Hmm. I can confirm that when you work on a PC platform, doing profiling kinda sucks, because everything you do on your PC is gonna melt down. For performance. So, like, any background tab you have open is gonna affect your game's performance. And that sucks. That looks like the right debug. Yeah, obviously we don't want the futon here, but I think it's a good PC remapping. It's been another 10 years since Island is finished. We've released the game. And then... Let's see. I don't wanna reveal anything yet. That looks so stupid. Finish. Good, sir. Feel free to do as you please. Wait, this is... This is the final version? Alright, that's... I'm gonna have to see how this looks in game. The style of this feels a little different from the others, right? It doesn't feel as drawn on paper, if that makes sense. But the pose is good. It does. I agree. I have to see. Maybe it needs, like, some noise on it. Maybe that's what's missing. I have to look at the others. Maybe this looks too professionally drawn. Like, the lines are too keen. Hmm. Something about it. I need something else for the car seat. If... I need a car seat-like material, maybe there's something... Wait. That's kind of not awful. Especially if I rotoscan that stuff a bit. Bleh. I don't know.   Now, the car needs a few decals still. Something to make it look more like a car. And at the front, some silver thing, maybe? Hmm. Yonza kind of feels like he has a bit of a modern design, you know what I mean? Now that I think about it. We kind of want the really old design of him. He's gonna fit R-64 style. Hmm. The car's from GTA 3. Can't play it. That's Vice City, right? Dude, I really could play a GTA game. I really want to play a GTA game. I have a Playstation 3, too. We bought it for like... $30. I don't know why I do that. Which one's the best one to actually play? I know that all of them have a giant cultural impact and they're super popular. But I don't think people actually play them. They usually just fuck around in them with cheats. So which one is the best if you actually want to play it and not just fuck around with it? I don't know. The grill is nice, but it needs to be shinier. Uncharted, God of War, Netflix. I only know God of War. And God of War feels like one of those movie games. Where you're not really touching the game, but rather you're mashing A for a movie. I think to express your free will as a human being, you need some amount of adversity. Actually, maybe you don't. But I don't feel very free without adversity. I actually have a lot.  Oh yeah, there's a Mario San Andreas mod. I want to play that one too. I might have some grills somewhere. That's better.  Maybe I have something in grits. Something like this might be important. That's kind of what I'm looking for. I think I can make this work. Oh yeah. Okay. This is going to look bad. But it's fine, it's fine. We got biobank. Biobank will bail me out.   I wonder how this is going to work out. Okay. Am I putting castle windows on doors? No. Yeah, you can get complex shadows running. I don't think you need my optimizations. There are plenty of N64 games that have complex shadows. Honestly, the major reason I don't want to add complex shadows is because if I add complex shadows in one place, I need them everywhere. And that's going to be so much work. If you only have them in one place, it's going to look so incongruent. I don't know if incongruent is the right word. I think this kind of works for the flying cars. And I think I am... For now? Oh yeah, this pose looks more like it. I think I like this a lot better. Yeah, but I'm done for now. And I will see you guys in the next game, which is going to be on Saturday, I believe. So until then, bye bye!
