Hello, hi hi, I wonder what that could be a notification for, there we go here we go Did it did it did it there we go Hello Selton XD Going on okay saved It's interesting Mario I bet they fired Martin from you yeah you got me Dude ever since I was little I loved stomping Koopas What's another strike let's another project or just another something it's part of course 11 in this game This game is Return to Yoshi's Island You have to say Koopa like it's a racial slur that's he says it Fuck I exported the toe of the wing cap That reminds me. Oh god. You're gonna love this biomech Let me show you in a second as soon as I removed the issue. I just introduced an excellent Oh What the hell Oh Hello Dawn, how's progress? Pretty, pretty well All right, let me show you what we've been working on. Dude, this level is starting to look pretty good Oh So, yeah, I was working on Bowser's office here You're gonna go here and it's gonna be a counter and that's gonna be a shy guy And when you go here the shy guy says, oh you're trying to visit Bowser go into the Waiting seats and wait forever because he doesn't take appointments or something like that And then this will be the elevator. There will be a door here that opens and closes when you come by And it will carry you upwards Yeah, he's gonna need something Yeah, that would be fitting but no what I really wanted to show you guys We have once again done a little bit of work on an old level this one here I Do you think biomech is it much better now? I So much prefer this over the previous one It like looks so much more vast It looks less like you're caged in an old thing I Don't have the old one in mind, what did you change? So in the old one the whole cloud ocean it was moving a lot faster and it looked a lot smaller And look like this was around this size of Bob-omb battlefield Now it like looks near infinite and the mountains on the sides I removed them and instead have like a little bit of a gradient that goes brighter And the mobile is further down so you can see the stars hung up in the sky So just looks a lot more infinite, you know what I mean We also have an options menu now look at this Yeah The cloud changes so much better You guys like the options menu Do not turn interlacing off it's not pleasant to not add to have interlacing on oh My god Ah But this increases frame rate by like 25% What percentage is done? 75 mean Quick 64. Yeah This one doesn't do anything yet and limit FPS pretty obvious Somehow limited FPS looks more shaky than interlacing Oh God Next to do your birthday. No, that's unlikely Maybe in two years to your birthday but even then I like to I think I like to release my games around September and Just because that's the time where it's like least likely Nintendo's gonna take them down and Makes it run at 240. I not 480 Your birthday isn't like four days Lila becoming 17 Insane What are you gonna do for your birthday I Roblox ebay dude, you can finally join the roblox e-dating website. Let's go Hello Archie quaternion cake is that is that any good? Any ost wishes for today I Am not listening to the Power Rangers OST, I'm very sorry. I didn't let me to open up. Yes Oh This Roblox e-dating website fit into that child labor theme I bet it was programmed by children That's why it's 17 plus because the 17 year old programmed it. Otherwise, it would be 18 plus No, we need like full game OST stone not just a single song Did it so fucked up why do we have a 17 plus dating website who wants to put 17 year olds with actual adults together Who's your target audience here I Would not sound good. Oh, yeah, so 17 plus sounds so much better But actually I see what you mean 18 plus sounds like it's a hookup thing Hello Delta You Already know the people going there are not gonna be 17. They're gonna be like 13 14 I don't know dark silence. I want to know see that I know getting rejected down there as a cock blocks I Just thought a new video very nice America most colors are mismatched. I want to play this game anymore The colors are mismatched Wait, what's that mean? How the colors mismatched? I Am thinking if the full polynomial thing you would work at all with fixed points The implementation seemed to rely on the floating-point format I mean the math is a lot faster floating-point formats because if you do it in fixed point formats Doing a multiplication is so much slower. And also you can't do the square root thing so Unless you have like a completely different architecture with where integer multiplication is faster. No, no shot On the n64 the answer is definitely no And yeah output is floating point anyway, so it doesn't really make a difference For the DS, do you have a square root instruction on the DS? How do you do square roots on the DS? It's 120 seconds That is an issue I Oh Yeah, that's awful Damn I Mean 120 losing 120 cycles is not a big deal on the n64 as long as you don't lose any memory bandwidth I I'm I'm I'm I'm     I'm     I'm    I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm    I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm    I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm    I'm Oh, that was the Yoshi plush I made for you, that was a picture of it. Oh yeah, he's hidden far off in the distance, you need to clip for that. I think if I fly up I can see it eventually in the distance. Oh there it is! There he is! Oh, and there he goes. And now Plagg Yoshi just sits on his desk. The camera should just pan around the room for a second before zooming to the cardboard. Alright, let me see that again. Yeah, I think we need to remove the Yoshis from here. You think this one should just like pan around the room? I don't know if I agree with the pan here. I don't think you should remove them entirely, maybe just make them slightly smaller so they're not... Should we have a full on child's room model around it? Yeah, honestly I would like that. I think we should remove the Yoshis out of the cardboard though, we should move the Yoshis somewhere else. Maybe into the room. Yeah, maybe instead of a cardboard box we can make it into just a whole bedroom. Yeah. Let's remove the middle Yoshi. No, I think these Yoshis are a bit too weird. I quite like them. We should still have them in the room somewhere. Yeah, we'll have them in the room but not in the box. Yeah. This is gonna be the kid's Mario box. And then I agree with Pileback's assessment that there should be more around here. Like there would be a table over there and the Yoshis could be on the table. Maybe there's like a little Mario playset. Yeah.  Either way, this is not something we actually want to look into right now. Can I flex for you, Rekka? Is that good enough? Can you actually see that? Man, I can't even use all my channel points to flex. Because we don't stream on Twitch anymore. You're welcome, Rekka. Couldn't put so many deals on this. Yeah. I mean, if someone's willing to implement those. Elements of the Smash 64 intro cutscene room. Hmm, I'm not decided on that yet. Big House is over, done, I don't want to see any more in-game scenes. Yes, 100%. I'm just finishing the jump for Wiggler and I'm gonna send him over once he's done. Alright. So it goes walk, jump, walk, right? Yeah. Okay. Just making sure. I think the rework for the clouds in the level there has also improved the performance a lot. But I haven't been able to test it yet because the level just crashed on me. Something went wrong with the flying seagulls. FLYING SEAGULLS I mean that was a big house level if you consider that Mario is in your computer and your computer is in your house. True. Dude, I'm actually so much looking forward to the next level that we have planned. Because the next level that I wanna do... It's gonna be... Where is it? The Wild West Valley. There's gonna be cowboys, you're gonna be catching like villains that are running around. There's gonna be wanted posters. It's gonna be so scenic. Do I get to make the wanted posters? You follow like the different cowboys, yeah. Nice. What kind of cowboys are we having? I'm not sure yet. We have to think of like a bunch of villains that just show up here. I mean like, we've already used the Koopas for Koopalinko. Drybones, like Leela says. Drybones unironically. There should be a Drybones boss fight with like a Drybones sheriff. Pistols at dawn with the sheriff. Yeah. I like that. I like that a lot. I also started making a list of like ideas. That I wanna implement later. So I'm thinking like a scavenger hunt would work really well on this. I have a question, Biobuck. Did you ever finish the conspiracy theory Yoshi room? That is something we should have, yes. So there would be like... Likely what we would have is there would be three villains running around and there's like three little boss fights. There's gonna be a scavenger hunt where you have to find signs around the level. It's like there's gonna be a sign that tells you a hint. You go there, you ground pound, you get a new sign, right? Maybe it starts off with a map, like a treasure map. It kind of fits the Wild West theme I find. And then the last two stars are gonna be red coins and the 8-bit pipe. So all the six stars are already kind of decided. Why do you have an emu open? I see, Biobuck. Because I needed to see this and I forgot to close it. Hayes is the only math teacher on the planet that you'll ever need. That's nice. Yes, dry bones are real. Lachlan Gibson will be so happy. Since cows are called Moomoos in the Mario universe, would cowboys be Moomoo boys? I mean, technically, yes. It's too bad we don't have meme review anymore. Honestly, I kind of miss meme reviews. We don't have any channel points either on YouTube. It's kind of sad. Yeah, that is a feature I wish they would bring back. There's so many features from Twitch that I miss. But it's not enough to go back because I don't miss the ads. Yeah, I don't want to go back to Ad Hell. You know what was really funny? When I went to the library yesterday to go print off some pages, there was a guy on the computer, just sitting through an ad before he started listening to Eminem and jamming out in the library. He was just going like... I'm just like, this guy's having the time of his life. Although his music was kind of loud for a place where you're supposed to be quiet. Lila, I had like three ad blockers and Twitch broke. I don't even use Twitch anymore. I think the ad blocker made it not work anymore. You might also just not have gotten many ads because you're in Portugal, Lila. Who would want to advertise to Portugal? I would. Yeah, I have uBlock too. I mean, look at this. I got Sponsor Block. I got Ad Block Plus. I got Ad Block. I got uBlock. And then I have like another one. Honestly, I think Germany is a socialist country, isn't it? I know a guy who has to pay over 70% in taxes. And he doesn't even make that much money in Germany. Yeah, I think I'd buy a bike. But, I mean, as long as uBlock still works. Dude, I actually theorized the craziest thing that Google should be doing. They should buy random small ad blockers, like the whole company, in secret and turn them into viruses. And then over time, ad blockers will gain a reputation for being viruses. And people will get rid of the ad blockers. And Google can't push that message because they're big. They control the news. That way they can get rid of all the ad blockers and advertise to so many people. That's illegal. Oh no, they get fined 2 billion dollars. Who cares for Google? Do you know how many times Google got fined like 2 million dollars last year? Like 2 billion. Like, just go to the... Oh shit, I didn't mean to post that. Just Google like Google fined and go to the news. 160 million dollar fine. 2 million dollar fine. 32.5 million dollar fine. 30.000 dollar fine. Like, they don't give a fuck. It doesn't matter. Sunrise already mining crypto using a computer guaranteed. Yeah. It's like one loose coin. Exactly. Hi Peter. He's like, I don't know. How much money do they make in a day? Yeah, just from like their stock going up. They probably made like 15 billion dollars yesterday.  We can find every adblocker source code and contact the people behind it. No, they don't need to find everyone. They just need to find like a few every now and then. Random ones. And then push the news. Adblockers are being turned into viruses. That's enough. It's terrorism. They only hit like two towers and everyone in America was afraid. New ones were put up though. So, new towers are built. We still have playing regulations. Okay. 34. 34 is not enough. It needs to be like 80. Okay. The walking hop is done. Alright, I didn't get an idol because I didn't know what to do for an idol. Oh no. Okay. 167 uncommitted changes. That's just one day of work. Okay. I don't know if I made everything work right now. Let me just check. Dude, curvyj playsound1 and playsound should be like one define. Look at this. This is stupid. I need to add that extra define. Just to save myself some typing work. You cannot throw balls out of the window, unfortunately. Was ist mit Deutschland? Nothing? Why would anything be with Deutschland? I don't know what's going on in Deutschland at all. Oh, I forgot to actually move the object. That's not an elevator door. Okay, Leela. Did you really want to summon the half-hour texture-picking stream? Alright, Leela. That's on you. You just summoned the half-hour texture-picking stream. Any idea if I want to show at E3 2024? I don't decide what's shown at E3. Or, well, I do decide what goes in. But I can't decide what people submit.  Whoops. So, that was decent. But a few things still are bothering me. Let me do the half-hour texture-picking. Alright. You want the model? I'll send you the model. You don't really need the model for anything other than to know the dimensions. Where did I store the elevator door? Elevator shaft? This is not an elevator shaft. Why did I name it that? Does it work with the current textures for now? Alright. If you are changing the texture, at least change the animation. LMAO, have you ever taken an animation? Huh? Huh? Oh, nice lol. lolon695. I'm just gonna call you lol. lolo. 1930 elevator? Yeah, it's Bowser, dude. Bowser isn't gonna make sure there's safety regulations into place. Maybe it should open a bit quicker. Maybe not. I need to make sure this only plays while the elevator is actually ready. Which is action 0 and action 3. Makes sense. Hello, contendo. How about we make the elevator break halfway through and you drop into the arena? No? Huh? What arena? Okay, I think you don't really know how the star works. Let me recap what happens. So, you can enter the arena.  You can enter Bowser's office anytime you want. And when you enter it during the first or second act, he's just gonna be complaining about losing to Mario. You know, in the second Bowser boss battle. And when you enter it in the third one, then stuff happens. Interesting. Hmm. Yeah, so if you enter it in the third one, then Bowser's gonna talk about how he's gonna send him a strike breaker. And then as soon as you leave the building, that's when everyone's gone. And that's when the boss appears and eats Mario. Is the PP port user? Where is he porting his PP? We have Minos in there. Please, do not port your PP. Hmm. But what if instead of an outlet was an infinite staircase and at the bottom are winded minions? Nope. How would you get up there? I mean, it's a funny idea, but it just doesn't make any sense here. You bought an Everdrive thanks to me? You should get the cheap Chinese knockoff. I do not support the Everdrive proper ones, because they don't work on my end. Fuck em. I paid a lot of money for that one too. Yeah, and it doesn't work. It's fucking devastating. Is this the correct formula? Uh, at least you just made that up on the spot. I don't know if it actually works. Let me think about this. If you have 10 velocity, then you're gonna go 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0. That's 30? Let me just type this into Google Chrome real quick. That is 30. Okay. And 10 divided by 12 divided by 4 is 30. All right. I can literally just make up shit and it will work. I am fucking insane. Um, otherwise we do not lower the velocity. Otherwise we just approach zero. Let's try this. Can we move on? Please at least make it open like an actual elevator. here. Why would you have two geo layouts? Leela, one of them is the collision model. I always have a separate collision model. Steal the star door code. Do you think that programming an object to move slightly to the side is that difficult? Oh my god, so glad I managed to do this without stealing the star door code. Why am I not moving? Oh, because I forgot to move it. Oh my god, so glad I managed to do this without stealing the star door code. Hello, CKDeath. The answer is no. Alright. Yes. Dude, why the fuck is it not moving? What is wrong? It's a separate sound, it's true. I'm actually just gonna move this into a separate register variable. Code quality. Yeah, it is elevator music. Oh, that reminds me. We got a new song from Badoob. You totally missed it. It's for the second Bowser level. Can you hear this one? Did I hear this one already? Maybe, I'm not sure. This one is composed in a specific way where you can disable two channels and you get an indoors version and you can enable another channel to get an outdoors version. So, it's gonna be very, very atmospheric. This is probably causing the issue. It's good but not Bowser-y? It's very Bowser-y, if you ask me. Is multiplayer supported? Not yet, but it is planned. Okay, it should move up now. Hey, we got an elevator shaft. Let me out! No, there's just an up and down here, I don't need buttons. Am I going to make the union mission? That's what we're doing right now. Okay I'll recap it. All the minions gather around Bowser's plaza and they're on a strike. They're striking against Bowser and then you enter Bowser's building and you go up to Bowser and Bowser doesn't acknowledge you. Bowser just stands there and he's like, Man I hate these guys! Fuck them! I'll send my strike breaker! I need the big guns! And you go outside and the entire strike is gone. And the level music is quiet and you don't know what's going on. It's very ominous. Maybe we'll have like blowing wind just like it's the only thing. And then as soon as you walk out the big big oil monster comes and it just eats you and drags you into a different area. So Big FKS. I guess this also happens on action 5 when you do not have a b-param. All right this should work now. Would be interesting. Well that's what we're gonna do. You will see this. I'm not gonna make a physical cartridge because if I do I will get sued to shit. But I might make a box and an instruction booklet and all that and I'm probably gonna sell those as merch and then you can get the cartridge somewhere else not from me. Is there a way to make the doors open in the water? That's like some of the most confused message I've ever seen. What's that mean? What's happening with the box? I don't know. It's probably just missing some stupid thing. I don't like that they just don't close anymore. And yeah this is where you're gonna see Bowser from. Those should not be biting you though. But I don't oh shit that's an insane idea Biobank. Why did oh my god actually yes there will be a download link in there. We can make it QA scannable. Oh but what if one link ever gets taken down? Oh I know why. So a domain oh yeah I should do that. Oh I see well of course it's possible. I thought he wouldn't be talking about the elevator doors. Can still send a take down to your domain provider. Yeah but are they gonna buy my game to like find the URL? It'd be so funny if they bought my game and then took down a real link website. So Biobank is not a programmer. He does some 3D modeling on the air. There's actually a bunch of programmers in chat but most of them don't work on this game. I'm a big aider but have you seen the AI QR codes? These actually work. This actually works as a QR code. That's insane. Should I try one? No. Okay. It's kind of neat though.  I am actually not an AI hater. So So  Shouldn't be this way around. The z-axis is fucked I swear. So I managed to raise it for Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. Okay. So So Just thought it was cool. Oh no. That is an issue. Upsetting. Maybe keep it like that. Sure. Yeah, so the problem with the doors is that they don't actually get the distance from the middle of the doors. They get the distance from the other place. So if we do this we'll be fine. The other thing is just a collision bug that we need to fix later somewhere else. Yeah, I'm keeping text-edge for the text. So How about you make the other part less and that you go through some sort of wind? No. I tend to avoid using AI because sure some things might be easier but if you keep using AI for so long you're just missing out on learning something yourself. Yes, but people have said the same thing about books like 2000 years ago. It's like oh avoid books because they're gonna make you bad at memorization. The question is the skills that AI lets you skip learning are those even valuable anymore if AI can do them for you? I think AI is a bit different because now AI is starting to do the things that we humans thought we were uniquely good at and it's like adding so much futility to human existence. Does that make sense? Yes. It's like why even try if something better can be done without any effort? I am feeling mega poggers and super based and I thank you for asking Elsie. Oh that worked. Let's see if we can go back down. It is not letting me back down. But the fact that I realized as soon as the unstolen work is dubious and the main reason I hate it. Oh okay so if it was trained on non-stolen work you'd be fine with it? We're working on today? How's this elevator? I mean I guess if the artists that had their work that's used in training data and they got compensated for it it wouldn't be that big of a problem. Yeah you say that but then there's the company asking for people to make CAD models for three dollars per model and training the AI on that. Well they shouldn't be paying you three dollars per model. That's not reasonable. Oh okay well I think what's gonna happen this is my prediction about the future. I'll tell you what the future will be. Big companies will push for AI regulations to... Ban AI from stuff. You see that already with Disney doing it. Second, they will push for regulations that allow you to just not use AIs that are trained on public data. Then big companies will hire people to make art for them to train the AIs and then big companies will have an exclusive right or an exclusive ability to use AI to produce quickly. So this will increase a lot of monopolization which is why I think it's kind of a bad idea to restrict AI like that. People will not be able to keep their job, Lina. This just won't happen. Okay, we need to somehow find the distance to x equals zero I think. And use that to get this proper. Can copyright AI artwork? You can't do that yet. What about as soon as it's like trained on artists who paint? It's so shitty and dumb because we practically use I mean okay but it's been advancing so fast. Like a year ago no one would even consider that. What if in like two years it's just better than humans in every way? That's a thing you need to like consider. Companies have been settling for good enough years ago. I remember playing an online game in I think 2011 and they just put the game for Google Translate. Well the crazy part is if you train an AI to make things look human it might end up looking like a human. It might end up being better than humans at that. Which at that point we're just kind of fucked you know. So Wasn't there wait. I remember someone AI generating like in a little child's crayon drawing and posting it somewhere and people were like wow even this is better than the AI art. And it was a literal art AI generated little children's drawing. It was generated to look like a little child ruined. Yeah that definitely sucks by the way. Well regarding AI music only App64 was using AI music for the entire game and people liked it. You did not? A lot of people liked it. It was entirely AI generated all of it. So we did not go down here did we? How come? Oh this is why. I don't think Badoob wants to compose a 45 minute album. Oh yeah let's see. I mean just like comparing to how good it is now to how good it was two years ago. You give it another two years it's gonna have like such a big leap again. Especially now that so much is being invested into it. It's gonna be pretty crazy. Oh yeah I changed Mario's bounciness a little bit. You see that how he scratches now? You guys like it better than before? Why did it open so early? I think it opened too soon now. I must have fucked up something. Fix his shadows. I don't think that's possible without a lot of extra lag. But we can look into that at some point. I think the camera should be fixed during the elevator so you can't see through walls. The camera should have sphere collision so you can't see through walls. That's a planned feature. How is this computing? Oh this is why. Yes not random I am. Please just clear frame before an emu. Never. I think I could have replaced Caracias. Maybe in like 15 years. Wait what? This was supposed to move the elevator up and then let me go down. Does it stop doing that as soon as I get off? No it really shouldn't. It should just move up. What is going on? I am playing BTCM and both the collision and the anchorage camera sucked in the same spots. So I am too lazy and being in a tight space could unblock the rest of the level for a better experience. Yeah? Honestly the solution is to just not make tight spaces. If you look at this level here. Like the elevator shut here. I had to extend it a lot so that it doesn't suck while kicking up here. Same here. I think that is the only good solution. The elevator is like a special case. We might have just a fixed camera here. Yeah I think so too Sonic. I think it is entirely existential. If the one thing that you as a human are good at can just be done by something else. Doesn't it feel futile to like learn a skill to have a passion? I think people have an innate desire to be good or useful at something. And you just lose that. I mean you already lose that a lot with globalization because now there is so much competition. Are there so many new people joining the discord? I put a link in the newest video to the discord. Well you could have drones for that Josiah. I think it is a bit silly to assume that will never happen. Do you like BTCM? That's good. I only got like 8 or 9 stars in it. Did I already forget what the issue was? Right the thing is not moving up as soon as I get off. Why would it do that? Let's just print the action state and see what happens. Did you not enjoy it? I mean I don't think there was anything too bad about it. I just really wasn't into it. That's good Beta. I think 2 out of 3 are entitled to that as a moderator. The action state is free. Okay so the action state is free. But it just doesn't move. Oh I see. You know that's what I do about Beta. There's already thousands of people who already do that. I do about Beta. For me it's about self-improvement. Yeah that is a fair way of looking at it. But I mean even if there are people that do it better than you. You doing it is still useful in some way right? If the AI can just do it for free. Then it will no longer be useful. Because it can already just be done. The door is no longer open. No. C++ is not bad at all right? C++ is easier than normal C. It just has a few more functions that you can literally just ignore if you want to program C++. Free. Getting a job in AI development is not easy. It's very complicated to make AIs. Okay sus. Oh no I'm sus. Okay I need to make it so that these can open quicker again. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay I see why this is happening. It's because it's waiting for the elevator to like stand still. So what if we have an additional condition of the elevator being far enough away. Like a thousand coordinates. Let's try that. Okay. I want it to be easy enough to get the coin without having to debug and all that. Damn Sonic you missed my future prediction. You would have liked that. That it is cheaper to live in Turkey than to live in a home city. Time to move to Japan. Damn that's crazy. But don't you live in like a four square meter apartment if you do that. Let me in. That took way too long. Oh I know why. I should have compared to this. ADHD medication is illegal in Japan. That is crazy. But I would also be jailed if I went to Japan for ROM hacking. The frame time on fire objects. What do you mean the frame time on fire objects? Do you think they're in sync? I can't look at both at the same time. Are they in sync? How do I cross-eye? I can't cross-eye. I don't think they're in sync. Hey it worked. Who is it? It's my phone. Okay this might be important. Pick up. It was her dad. It's because we want to buy a house maybe. And he wants to help us. Because that way we can save around $20,000 in taxes. Which would be very nice. And I actually can't get a loan right now because my income is too low. But we can afford the house. We just can't get the loan. Of course I'm not fatherless. I mean hey if we do get that house, Kaze can have a very fun new setup. Oh yeah dude I will have a bunker. I will be streaming from a bunker. It will be very fun. Let me just send you the picture of the basement. Alright so the elevator is finished. Income too low in your case? Yeah. I can't get a fucking loan for a house. Even though the mortgage is about as much as rent. Yeah this is what it's looking like. This is where I'm going to be streaming from. Let's fucking go. It's kind of a fun house though. Yeah. No I'm not considered a senior programmer. Because I basically just started working professionally like a year ago. I don't know what you need to do to be considered a senior programmer. It's messed up. Bowser minion living conditions. I mean I also work in the game industry where you make less money than anywhere else. Programming wise. But if you can afford it, why need a loan? I can afford the loan payments pretty easily. Kaze just aged by 10 years and become a senior. I don't know what even a senior is supposed to mean. I think it's just a word that they use for someone who's been in the industry for a long time. Is that Bowser's, the chair we're using? Yes. Okay I thought it was going to be just a regular office chair but that works perfectly. Because that chair is in the blender scene itself. Yeah. Corporate world is crazy. Would you like a job at Big Corporal? If they paid me enough money. I would work there for like 2 years and then retire and never come back. I said you last coded Java in 07 and you code on Github. Well I started programming in TI Basic in 2007 or so. Is that chair like up against the wall? His chair, is it up against the wall? Yes. Okay, good. That sounds fun, Betta. I was actually thinking a game similar to what you're saying, but instead of controlling them, you program them. So there's like two people and they go in rounds and they get to program their minions with like a certain amount of code lines on each minion and then they fight. And if you make a bug in your code, your minions just useless. It's like competitive programming. How cool would that be? There is a game like that already? Rabbit's coding, let's see. What? How do you play this? I want to see gameplay. Oh, that's not what I was thinking. That is like so basic. I guess they made this very accessible. No, this is for like five year olds to learn programming. That's not what I- no, no, no, no, it needs to be way more hardcore. I want you to just be there like sweating going to do-do-do-do-do-do-do on your computer. I want- let's just open a paste bin. I want you to do just like every- maybe like a bunch of macros. I can't even program fast enough for that. You can already do this. It's called coding a game. Yeah, but imagine that this is in a 1v1 environment. Muscles are coding. Depends on your living situation, I think. Oh, to my life. Shit. Probably coding, because that's what makes my money. Just use auto. True. Auto is the solution. 1, 2, 3, 0. Actually, the hitbox should be bigger. Yeah, it should be like when you are entering this area here. Oh, 5, man, this guy is free optimization flex ahead. If enemy is alive, kill while you will only be able to program your own guys and only access your own class variables. Influences for access plus lighting plus fog. I think death wizard did that. No, it will just be server authority. There won't be private variables. It will be server authority. The make going good button. Isn't that already almost real with like AI enhancing all video games? Have you guys seen that? The triple A slider. Let me find this. Yeah. Look at this. That is pretty crazy, isn't it? I have no idea what it was I am. As a latency penalty, probably pretty awful. All right, now we should have a dialogue box pop up as soon as we enter the level and it should make the camera pan to the Bossa seats that will be empty for now. Direction button. Direction button is still there. Other people are hitting it. For the office room window at the top, when you leave the elevator, the window looks like a mirror, especially. What's wrong with it? Should it like be cleaner? Oh, because of the brown upgrades. I think it's fine. Let me look at it again. The react button makes it very difficult for me to read the chat messages, which is a bit annoying. Let me actually also check out what's wrong with the talks box. Is the object home not being set correctly anymore? This looks right to me. Something weird is for sure happening with object homes. I'm thinking. Was a junior cannon in your game? Yes. I'm going to put a little picture of Bowser and Bowser Junior in his office. OK, well, Bowser Junior in this game is just Bowser when he was young. OK, I don't think that looks like a reflection because the animation face is different. Also, this one attacks you. I'm going to put a door there that can't open. All right, let's put a door here. Raytracing does not exist in N64, no. When Bowser is human like this, Bowser will be too absorbed in his own thoughts. I still want to know what's wrong with the Y position here. I think you should add a little computer screen to Bowser's desk. OK, that can work. This is something to look at. Thought of creating a new head-wearing guy from scratch? Well, he's just been... No. I think we have enough head-wearing bros. Let me see. Why are these Toxboxes actually moving along? It's not even that they move around 0, is it? 0 is so high up in this level. What are the Toxboxes doing? Could this be a map? The main level already has a good-ass map, yeah. Is performance on the N64 now? The worst part is 25 FPS. So performance is pretty good. Yo, what the fuck? Are they falling down? They're going further and further down. Every step they take, they go slightly down. Graph Y offset. Yo. 6, 7, 8, 9. That should be fine. It is. Every step that I take is another mistake to you. Hmm. Is this maybe weird? What if it's the add float one? No, no, it can't be. Hmm. What's the point of the tangible discs? All right, well. Useless. Case. Hello, Arthur. Okay. Okay, now the actual Y position is moving down. What if we just print their all home Y? Is this one changing? What do I think about Python? I think snakes are kind of cool. I wouldn't want one as a pet though. They don't really seem like good pets. Can I still attack with them? No. I'm not having a good time, by the way. If anyone's asking. Hmm. Comedy is back on the menu, boys. In case you should fix this, you should. Yeah. Woodwick? Woodwick. All right, I'll import them in a bit. I want to fix this bug first. Have I seen the e-girl drama? E-girl drama? What's going on? Which e-girls are involved? Favorite 3D Mario. I think 64. I don't know. It's just the vibe I'm getting from the stream. Expanded on Orphan, that's the e-girl drama. Were they into it? I see e-girls as offenses now. They want to call it iLadies. iLadies, nuts across your face. What, you think I was born yesterday? That was a pretty good one. Let's see. Let me debug print a few more variables here. Are you able to track how many units it keeps decrementing by? Theoretically, yes. It's weird how it just falls. Wait a second. What if... I don't know why the bug just now started appearing. But that was weird. Do we use this field anywhere else? 0x12, 0x12. Interesting. Let's see. What I think was happening, my theory right now, I don't know if this is true, is that the gravity kept decreasing its y-velocity. Eventually its velocity was so small that it just fell through the floor. I don't know when I added the gravity. Oh, I know when I added the gravity. For the big protest. I can't add the crystal right now. It's not in the game yet. Hardware modding consoles to make them more beefy is done, but it's very uninteresting because it's trivial. Like, it's already been figured out. It's just a lot of manual labor. Should probably just go over here. No, I think they're friends. Oh my god, have you seen that movement? All the five circles that appear in the top right corner, they are Yoshi coins. You can find five Yoshi coins per level in this game and they replace the one on Coin Stars. So much for our long previous video,    Fucked up Yoshi moment of the week. Matt appears in Super Mario Kong only in chapter 11 of volume 12, where she is stated to be the water fairy of Peaceful Woods, corrupted by Wario polluting the river. However, Matt is seen once in her near-death form in a surreal form, which seems to be the water itself. How is this a Yoshi? Until Yoshi drinks her up and urinates her out. Now free from Wario's evil toxin, Matt is reverted to her pure state, an anthropomorphic fish in a dress. Okay, so Yoshi canonically pisses. Okay, so we got that done. Next, I need the first star. And to get the first star, we need to program the Wiggler. So let's import Zena's new Wiggler. It is finally time. It's Wiggler time? It's Wiggler Wednesday. Did you check the animations? I am working on it. Very nice. Okay. Misclick. Will he be racist this time? I hope not, dude. I think he still has the angry face on him. I might make a really angry face for him. I mean, that's kind of nice. I figured the idol in Talk to Mario can just be the same one. Did you make this angry model?  Yes, I made this angry face. I find that, you know, this is a bit weird. The blurry lines? Yeah. Maybe I can... Yeah, this one is a lot less... It's more aliased. Ah, I see. Or anti-aliased. All right, let's see the animations. That's his normal pose?  Okay. This is base pose. This one doesn't... That's only used as like... This is angry. Angry one. Okay, so this is where he's like in the cutscene and you see him and he's angry that something bad happened, right? Yeah. Then this is anti-pose. We don't need it. So this is when he gets more upset. Oh, that's good. He's very happy about being angry. This is when he talks to Mario about who's still working. And this is when he's like so angry he stops off. Yeah, you can make it a little faster. All right, that looks pretty good. It's not perfect, but this is also really hard to work with, so... Yeah, I mean, it's good. It's good? Yeah. All right, I'm gonna be the best animator on this project. Actually, I'm the only animator on the project now. Yeah. He looks like he's jamming to Eminem in a public library. Who's the real Slim Shady now, bitch? I think the thing that frustrated me more about that is he didn't skip the ad. He just watched through the entire ad. Imagine being so done with life that you watched the ad. It's like there's a skip button. You can also just quickly install an ad blocker on the library's complete computers. Just do it.  NPC behavior, true. It is complete NPC behavior. This song. This song. This song. This song. Anyway, I'm stuck at 90 kilos. I think I need to be 85. You're 184. If you're 184 and you have a decent amount of muscle, then 90 is a pretty healthy weight. But if you want to lose 5 kilograms, maybe because you don't have as much muscle, just drink enough water. Drink or eat low-calorie dense foods like carrots or celery or chicken. And you're fine. Some of this seems to have messed up. Shouldn't be hard to bring back. Wait, did you add any colors to this? No, I don't think so. Huh. The only thing I added was just a face texture and that's it. Yeah, and just something is not working right in-game. Oh, I know why. It's because of Fast64. What did I do? I don't know, Lula. I do not know. All I did was add a face texture to him. Now it's a Fast64 bug. Where's the fastpoke emote when you need it? R.I.P. Can you only have 4 emotes right now? I think so. Well, that's kinda sad. Now his face is still way too dark for some reason. It works everywhere except in his face. This should do it. Is it day and I turn on Prim? No, it uses Elf. We just need to change the bone order here. Because there's no way to put a GOASM before the first bone. I hate all the Koopalings. They just shit up Mario Kart 8. It was so disappointing unlocking a new character and it was just a stupid Koopaling every time. But I like the Koopalings. Okay, but wouldn't you rather unlock someone you actually like other than the fucking Koopalings? What is it? I like them. What? They're so neat. What? No way! Who did I marry? Yikes! She must be like a human wearing a skin suit. Like a lizard. How can you like the Koopalings? I mean, I like Bowser Jr. a little more. Bowser Jr. is fine. But the Koopalings? You don't like them? No! Okay, well, I'll say this much. The Koopalings are far better than Pink Gold Peach. Yes. Fair. And Metal Mario. Yeah, but why not unlock characters you actually like? Why not like King Boo or a Goomba or like fucking a Parakoopa? Goombas can't drive. They don't have hands. Okay, uh, Mutant Piranha. Yeah, I guess. El Piantissimo from Mario Sunshine. What? El Piantissimo. El Piantissimo? E. Gant. Um, a Thwomp. A Whomp. What? Wait. Which one's which? I can never tell. He's like an NPC. No. The Queen from Mario- Yeah! Why fucking Koopalings? Thwomp. Thwomp doesn't have hands or legs. How is he supposed to drive? Do they just like attach wheels to him and he just pushes it with force? Yes. Is that it? If a Thwomp can drive, a Goomba sure can. Okay, fine, a Whomp then. I just threw out a million suggestions that are better than Koopalings. Okay, we have a problem here, and that is his hitbox. His hitbox is weird. Mario 64 can only do cylinders. Try to approximate this guy with a cylinder. We can do that. Honestly, that's not too bad. What if he's just two cylinders like this? Let's do it. This one can be a bit shorter. They can have a Pikachu, yeah! Fuck it, let's get Pikachu. Anything to avoid another Koopaling. Who wants to play as Wendy fucking Koopa? Just use dynamic collision. No. I want the Brodude boss fight fires better than Mario Kart 9. You know what? I take that over Koopaling. Okay. Where is this in world space? Where is this? My cursor is at minus 350. Wait, I can use offset child by float. But I shouldn't. Is God real in the Rty lore? No. What is this? This is where we mess with everyone. What is a Divine Dino then? I don't know. God has his reasons. He's mysterious, we can't understand him. What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this? Some random woman pregnant was kind of an L. Why? What's the L here? What is this? She didn't technically consent. Did she not? Damn. That is fucked up. Wait, did she? I think she did. I think she canonically did. Hello Carlos. What's happening in here? I can... How? I think an angel appeared to her and asked her...  ...if that was fine. And she said yes. I didn't mean to close that one, I still need that later. Tell me about the Jesus one, you don't remember that? Did you not read the Bible? Damn. Oh, I was holding the Koopa animations on it.  Okay, that hitbox is pretty fine to me. I kind of like it. Pretty good. Where do you interact to talk to him? Anywhere in the front. Let's find the text room. He should have multiple texts actually. Oh my god, we have so much dialogue in this game.  God told her I will baby you and she said... ...I am God's servant, so whatever you say. Is that consent? Maybe it's a little ambiguous. New text just dropped. Need some goggles red guy? My face is this way. That would be funny. Okay. So, 3, 5, 4... ...2... ...6 are Koopas. 4 Koopa texts. And then a Goomba... ...and then 3, 5, 8... ...and 3, 5, 9 are Wiggler. Alright. Any problem? What's the problem? The Wiggler should also be protesting. No, actually the Wiggler should just be gone. Maybe you could use one of the stomping animations... ...at the protest. If he's there. If you want him there. 169 dialogues. It's already more than double. And it's gonna be more than that. But yeah, this game has a lot more text than Mario 64. Well, it also has a lot more content and playtime. So it makes sense. Right? It's not that bad. Okay. Oh, wait. This is a bit of a problem. I like your animation. Thank you. You know what? Wiggler's animation was a lot harder... ...than Bowser's walk cycle. But I did it faster than Bowser's walk cycle. That's good. I think that's a testament to something. Yeah, it means you're learning. The worst part about doing Wiggler is that there's no good references to find for him. I found two.  Alright, let me think about this. What are the text Wigglers are gonna say? So you have the glass guys, you have the cement guy, you have the Goomba on a lunch break, and you have the thwomps lined up. And the Wiggler should always mention one of the things that are still going on. So... Wiggler... let's see. Glass, Wiggler, cement, Wiggler, Goomba, lunch break, Wiggler, thwomps. Actually, that Goomba lunch break should be first. Um, wait, there's just four ways to mess with them? Yeah, right? Alright, so he should talk about that we're getting a lot of work done, one of my guys is on a lunch break, please don't bother him, something like that. If this is ASMR, then that's unintentional. But it's so warm here, I need to drink constantly. It's not quite cooled off yet. I woke up to piss like three times last night, it's so warm. I can't wait to just live in a basement, in my bunker. Well, if we get the house. Stop knocking on wood, that's cringe. Make me, I thought you were the one who said you embrace cringe. Yeah, but that's the wrong kind of cringe. You said embrace cringe, you didn't say what kind of cringe. It sounds like a you problem.  You're cringe. Guys, is it cringe to believe in superstition? I think it is. You know what, he should pick a random one that is still available.  Yeah, Ayobex always got the dialogue options. One of my guys has been on a lunch break for a while, mind checking on him. These rivets aren't gonna carry themselves. You know what, yes. A Goomba would just sit there and try not to get hurt. Maybe he's one of the diversity hikers. I mean, he doesn't have arms, and he's also the only Goomba, so him being a diversity hiker makes sense. What the fuck is a rivet, by the way? I'm gonna google a rivet. What if this is a Ligma? Oh my god, he would have gotten me so hard.  Yep, that works. He is floating. Yeah, I can just move him along. That reminds me. All of this stuff should be somewhere else. So... On level entered, yes. This is how we name shit at GSB. Like, event dispatcher, so just call it that way. This is what I'll do. Goomba was hired to fill the diversity quota. What, that was the joke? Yep, perfect. When is this function called? Level CMD free pool. Yeah, so that's perfect. Where is the J coming from? What the fuck? I am so confused by the existence of the J. So it was Chris in the moment. There is no other Chris that took you longer, right? The Chris progress shows how much you improved in scale and whatever your ideas got. I think this one took so long because it's like the first job I- or the first one I made while having a proper full-time job on the site. And I'm also making like so many videos right now. Did I already move him? Yes, I did. Full-time job on the site. Well, I guess that shows how I truly think. The shorts business? I think he's talking about YouTube shorts. Oh, the shorts business. Um, I have enough YouTube shorts stashed up right now for the next year. And I have uploaded shorts for every week until the end of like January next year. And I'm just like uploading them once a week. And hopefully we're gonna get a bunch of views on them. The Gooby Woobies one is my favorite. You're a Gooby Wooby. Am I at least a top one Gooby Wooby? Yes. Um, it does contain 64-bit floating math, but not on purpose. It's because when you use integers in floating point math, it like automatically converts to a double and from there converts to a single, which is really fucking stupid. And I'm trying to prevent that, but I don't always do that on accident. So I'm still gonna remove all the non-32-bit floating point math. I guess that's good. I feel like they're edited like boomer Facebook videos. Okay, I will show you. I will go over the shorts business with you right now. I pay $5 per shot created. And as you can see, these are like uploaded for a long, long time. Uh, let's just check out like this one here. We can check the analytics. I value one subscriber to be around 5 cents. So this one made back like $1.20 out of the $5 I paid, which is not that great. But my hope is that one of these shorts... Can I like filter like that? That a few of these shorts just take off like this one here. And then these make the money back, right? So this one's like $17 of value. I guess that one paid for three shorts. Yeah. Not all the... I guess on average, the shorts are not really worth it. This one basically barely paid for itself. And it's like the second biggest one. So we're still working on it. We pay to edit them. And there's a guy that awkward himself up. His name is Legwood. Ended up in the shorts editing meta. Yeah. I guess they're still a relatively new video editor. But it is what it is. We make do with what we got. All right. We need a variable for all the overseers. What am I doing right now? Programming. And maybe this man has combined Mario 64 and Nintendo tried to kill him for it. And that's why. Yep. That would be perfect. You need to find the angle. You know what I mean? Dude, it's actually so hard to find the angle. Like when I make my videos, I struggle with that. Let me just... I'm gonna say it after the date. Like right here, I have to find an angle. How the fuck can I make a polynomial sound interesting? Well, the only up 64 already had like an interesting angle. The sine function even here. I had to like set up like for four minutes about how sine is important. The physics one, I guess I didn't succeed in finding the angle. The problem with grass, that one did way too well. This one maxing out the N64's potential. It's just a level preview, but that's like the angle. You'll edit my shorts for $4.99. You actually wanna? What's the grass? The entire video was inspired by Seath. I watched one Seath video. I fucking hated it. And then I just made the video. Sound labor is optimal, it's true. Yeah, exactly, buy a bag. That is the issue. YouTube is just not profitable for me because my channel is not that big or interesting. Seath makes great videos. Cope, he never gets to the fucking point. I mean, I only watched like two videos of this. I watched one video because Biobank recommended it. And then I watched another video because I was told, no, no, no case you're wrong. He's great. And no, he's not. He is the worst. Can you make videos? You just need to make videos about stuff that sounds obvious to you. Then you attack that stuff. Yeah, you're right. I 100% agree. I mean, that's what I plan to do for April fools, I guess. I'll make another one of those grass videos. I actually have a content plan, a content plan right here. All right, I'll tell you, I'll tell you the content I'm going to do. This one is going to be really good. It's about, this is for the 30th of September, cryptic stars in Mario 64 and how they work. It's going to be like about the EO, about the snowman, you know, all the stars that no one understands how they work. Then on the 21st of October, it's going to be called baking shadows into N64 games, which is going to be the Dino Dino domain preview. Then on the 18th of November, I was thinking of micro optimizing the arctan function. Uh, that one's probably not going to do well. On the 2nd of December, when writing bad code is actually good, where I like violate all the code conventions and show how it's actually going to make the code run better. On the 9th of September, of December, the N64 can be so atmospheric. It's going to be the Ghost 2 preview again, the remake. And maybe on the 16th of December, how good is the inverse algorithm on the N64? It's dog shit, but people keep suggesting it. And then on the 23rd of December, a video, maybe like it's never enough. I don't know if that's the angle I want to go with, which is going to be about the new optimizations and the Chris one remake. That's my current content plan. Feel free to ask me anything. Welcome back. I don't think a gym video would do that well on its own because while my physique is like super impressive compared to like normal people if you actually go into like gym videos you're gonna compete with people that just blast the shit out of steroids. You can make bang on a simple gym video playing on certain objects with the game work from a cold standpoint. We need to find an interesting angle though, right? Like the infinite stairs? Yes. The mirror? Yes. You know I'm noting that down. Shit, that's that's good content. Uh, fire back back again with all the great ideas. Okay, how the mirror works. How do infinite stairs work? Yeah. Maybe how the paintings work? Yeah, I've looked into how the paintings work. Oh, another idea I have was like the most obscure bugs in Mario 64. Stuff like if you wait in the file set and the star select screen for three years the screen locks up for 11 frames. Wait, what? Specifically three years? Yes. That is extremely hyper specific but okay. The one I'm super Mario's most broken but it's not Mario 64's most broken object. How would I convey that? So, explain why integer overflow underflow. Right, that was the guy that was making videos like that about Paper Mario and he got fucking famous. That's it guys. You know what? I want to be stored in a 32-bit integer. I'm fine with that. Can you explain the glitch that can freeze the game on the file select screen? Name it why you can crash Super Mario 64 in less than three seconds. Yeah, yeah, that's a good one too. Hello, Mario Nova. Hi, Nova. Hi, Seraphon. That could work well as shorts. Nah, fuck shorts. Shorts don't make any money. Lila, short content is not good. You have to be very verbose and unnecessarily so. The people, they don't want a video that's concise and to the point. They want background noise. You have to do something. You have to make a video that you can watch while you do something because that's what people are gonna watch. They wanna have the idea of I'm working with the thing in the background but really they are just using that to procrastinate. You are the procrastination. That's the role you have to fill. That's the matter. What if I started making my YouTube intros like Mr. Beast? How does it go? I verbed an adjective subject. I investigated the most... no wait, it needs to be a number. The three most broken objects in Mario 64. That would be like a good line. And then I shout it. Oh, that's perfect. I analyzed. I'm gonna be YouTube Mr. Beast, but for Mario. I verbed an adjective subject last night and she liked it. That's so consistency. Wrong hat for the 10-minute apology. But what would I apologize for? Oops. Got me stupid once I think, but I'm not apologetic for that, I'll do it again. What, just because I'm calling you stupid I'm homophobic? Yes, uh, well, understandable. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!  Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! What was that? Meow, meow, wow, just subscribe. Wow! Okay, it's starting to make me think that the code doesn't work. Okay, I think I'm starting to know that the code doesn't work. What do you want the wig line to do to your face, yo? It does look weird, but... I guess we could just make him not rotate to you. Okay, two more animations for Bowser. You have all of them done? I have a stomping tantrum, I have him sitting on a chair. He's sitting there, he can't be stomping his chair. Wait, that's a different one. Okay. That's a different one. But this is his sitting one, where he's just at his desk kinda... Yeah, okay, that looks good. He's just kinda thinking to himself. He should be there like, oh my god, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I mean, I have that in the pouty boy animation, where he's just standing and pouting. Well, he's sitting though. He's gonna be sitting and pouting. This is like a completely new Bowser, we only have new animations here. Okay. Well, this was hard to maybe throw a wrench into my plans. Pure luck that that worked at all. Who thinks I should be allowed to use variables that are not in scope? Okay. Okay. Okay. Three text deniers when Wiggler shows up. Alright, time to make the other texts. Wiggler Cement. Hmm. So I guess he should be annoyed with his workers. The cement guy's been watching his cement the whole day. Someone should kiss butt. Something like that. No, Leela, no. Hmm. Can we, we're paying that Koopa to watch the cement or I'll die? See, I think I'm just gonna run in there and ruin it. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.  I've been getting paid to watch cement run. The glass. I think he should be talking about how they keep dropping it or something. How they're so incompetent. How green Koopas just maybe how green Koopas just walk back and forth all day. Because that's what they do in the game, right? Isn't that the difference? Green versus red Koopa. Mark of Pharaohs or is it red Koopas? Do not mark of them. Oh, shit. Okay, nevermind. We can't put that joke in there. Racism is real true. Oh my god, Diddy Kong Racing is such a banger. Shit. You should call them doofuses. I think that's funny. You're kind of a green Koopa, so go ahead and do glass paints. You keep walking up edges. Probably enough for a glass paint on the fourth set of Koopas. Yeah, that's really good. That is very good. So every time something goes wrong, does this dialogue change? He has all these dialogues from the beginning, but whenever you destroy something, the dialogue is no longer available. So it gives you a hint as to what to do next. I see. Man, he's just shit talking all his coworkers. You know what? That actually sounds like someone in a higher position. He's a supervisor. He talks shit about all his coworkers. Jump with me, girl. My old manager used to call me slurs. I should have recorded it and fucking sued them. I think he could have made bank if it was a big company. Damn, that would have been like the jackpot. I mean, I had my first job I ever worked. I had the owner of the restaurant say to a customer he hates black people. But he didn't use the term black people. The one you work on right now has a guy put poop on the plate, so that's not any better. You know if that gets out to the health and safety board, that could get the restaurant shut down. They don't know it's a wooden monkey. Just... God damn it. Oh, oh no. No. Thanks, Kaze. Oh, that might not have been recognized as a slur. Because it's like... I mean, unless you actually have some sort of disability, I don't think that would count as a discrimination lawsuit. I mean, the r-word is kind of far more frowned upon now than it was ten years ago. Like a lot of people would call it a slur. Yeah, I think it's weird. Especially when you don't say it to someone who actually has a disability. If you just say it to someone who doesn't have a disability, I find it weird to consider it a slur. Because you wouldn't call someone who isn't the thing a slur. Like it's not used as a slur. Yeah, it's... It might be a case-by-case thing. Yeah. Okay, Wicklow Wombs. No, I can't tell. There's no reason to work there anymore. Still, it's harassment at work. Yeah. But I don't think it's lawsuit-worthy. Like, I don't think you have that. I think the best you can do is quit. Right, because discrimination is like an actual thing employers are not allowed to do. But harassment? If it's not based on any inherent characteristic on you? I think that's allowed. In a way. If it's not sexual. Yeah, either way. What's the angle here? The moms are working, they're eager to becoming part of the building. They're stacking up. Maybe these are the only people he likes? I don't like that. I don't think you should enjoy anyone's work. Lawyer Emmanuel has arrived. I'm being very clear that I don't know what I'm talking about. I think we're fine. I'm just waiting in a line. They shouldn't all jump in at once. Isn't he just there? I don't know. I don't know if that would work. But why are the moms waiting in a line angle? I like that. We just need a different justification for him to say that. The moms are falling over each other, trying to be the first at the building. They're over-excitable, something like that. I don't know. They're trying to be the first at the building. They're just slowing each other down. I'm not 100% content with this text either. I don't know. The thing I'm disliking from here is someone really needs to give them a push or they're going to be at it all week. Yeah, I like that. It's a nice hint too. Which I want. I think having more hints for her to do the missions is always good. Especially because it's so voluntary to talk to the guy. Alright, let's see. I guess it's been a lunch break for a while, okay. No, don't tell me, just talk about the lunch break. No way. You don't just talk about the lunch break. Oh, okay, we're just completely unlucky. No snacking. Ah! We need to get a target, okay. Dude, how much do you like this guy's lunch break? Shouldn't have hired green... Oh, shit. It's way too short. You carry the glass panes to keep walking.  Yeah, that's just... We're already on the third glass panes and all sorts of Koopas. Just one text is missing. The cement guy. Can we believe we pay that one guy to watch cement dry? Why? Alright, let me just make sure it works if you do all the missions. If you do all the missions, he should no longer be talkable. Dude, this is going to be such a fun mission to speedrun. Holy shit. Alright, he is no longer talkable. Perfect. Why did I do the text for the first mission so many times? Why is it the easiest to invent a thing where you can navigate through all the text boxes in the game? You're going to need that for localization. This is going to be no problem. I can just make it so you scroll with the D-pad and the L-button makes it pop up. Alright. I think we're done for today. I think I'm probably going to program the Wiggler over the week. Maybe today, tomorrow. And then next time we are finally ready to make the boss fight, I think. And jump into the water after he spots you. He's just going to storm out. We're not going to make him come in seppuku. Either way, I will see you guys next week. Bye bye. Bye bye.
