Oops. Dukon is nuts, I love her, true. Can't believe no one else got excited about her. I guess it's been a while since she's been in the spotlight. I guess it's been a while since she's been in the spotlight.  It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. I love Sine and Cosine. Do you guys appreciate Sine and Cosine as well as much as me? I feel like we don't appreciate it enough. Such a good function. I hate Tan. That's fair. And is somewhat evil. Okay, so stars for Sandcastle is too high. We'll do this. Now he has a Sandcastle on top. Oh, it's a Lego brick. True. He does kind of look like one. It kind of looks like pudding. Okay, this works. Next we need to make it so they poop out if you go at them fast enough. Not what I meant to do. Come back. Shit. That's a wrong button combo. Okay. No, that's not what I want. Do I not have a general purpose function for this? I do not. Oh my god. Definitely need one. Let's have one. That was kind of stupid that I didn't make one. Picnic? Oh? I'm still alive. Yes, all of this runs on N64. Bim crashed on Twitch. That's a Twitch bug. I don't control Twitch. What the hell? Oh, it shows me it's live again. That's annoying. I don't know why it's not working on Will. It should have banned you guys. I think we're talking shit. Doesn't quite work. Oh. Yes, we need that. Hello, XPM. We had him yesterday? Yeah, I scanned everyone off. He started talking about the thing. Let's take multiple hits? Nope. I'm just testing the hit detection function right now. This is definitely an issue. Where is it being rejected? It's just print. I'm going to use the bomb I had in my memory pack, because he looks nothing like a normal bomb. The shimmering sound? That's the OST we're listening to. We're listening to Star Fox Dimensions. Oh. So now it just works. Okay. I guess I can live with that. There we go. It was just the height was wrong. Now we need to proof it out. Once there's none on my left, we make the thwomp and give Mario a star. Is that the game box we are? Nope. What's the things text? I forgot. We had one. 191. We need to spawn a star without level exits. Mr. Skeletal? I'm not Mr. Skeletal. What if that works for this again? Oh my god. SP30. There we go. You know what the worst thing ever is? Ever since that pirate software takedown, people are like, don't use magic numbers in your codes, because of that one fucking idiot. So now I'm gonna probably get a bunch of people that are like, why is there a magic number here? It's like, shut up dude. Oh, is it an iterated type? Oh no! Just as I talk about it! No! No! No! Because an iterated type is a huge waste of time. If I have 491 entries, there's 0% chance I will want to reorganize them. Damn, that's fucking crazy. Anyone made a pull request for this, or had one merged? Yeah? Zell made one for a new font, and Sauron made one for a new song. What's F3 looking? F3 is looking pretty stacked this year. I'm very happy with the outcome so far. No, Kaze, you need to null pointerjack! No! You can't do this! No! Watch me! Oh, that fully sounds realistic to me, I'll just give it a couple years. Beautiful. Now we just need some protocol poofs. If you were to tell me that this should be inland? Okay, fair enough. Okay. Searching for this is kind of annoying. Find a protocol. Earth protocol. New plan to protocol. Oh, I know what this is. Digging. Digging. Messy shoes. Disturbed protocol. I think the digging one is the closest to what we need. What? You're dealing with like a 1000 plus coding rules? I mean, a lot of coding rules make sense, but a lot of them also just slow you down. You shouldn't be so rigid in them. At least, that's what I think. Hmm. I think I want to spawn them over multiple frames. Hmm. Something like the 7 here. I would never make a define for that. That's a number that's going to appear once. And yes, it is arbitrary, but like it has to be arbitrary. Like this is just a visual effect, right? You can't like mathematically determine what's going to look best. At least not in the current year. At least I won't know how to do it. Maybe you can. I'm stupid. Hmm. Oh no, I often refactor my codes to be more easy to modify. It's just that... Like something like this. The hitbox size. Why would you have a define? I never make a define or an enum for a number that is only used once. That's the rule. If it's only used once, you don't need to make a define for it. Well, I mean sometimes I make one, but you don't need to. If it's used more than once, you need a define for it. I think it's on switch flags as a warning. I'm like, why? Okay, that's fucked up. Do they force you to like manually type out a jump table even though GCC is perfectly capable of doing that itself? They might just not know that about GCC at your workplace. Or whatever compiler they're using doesn't have that feature, which would be pretty bad. The mist particle. No. Not a circle. Squiggly dust. Squiggly dust is pretty nice. We'll use this as a preset. Oh. Squiggly dust. Squiggly dust is pretty nice. We'll use this as a preset. Okay, this doesn't... Actually, this does fly somewhere. Let's try it. See what our path explosion looks like. It looks absolutely horrendous. Absolutely horrendous. Oh my god, that sounds so slow, Galaman. I thought my workplace was rigid and slow with that stuff, but maybe I'm completely wrong in that regard. Maybe I should cherish what I have and just accept the rules. Well the particles definitely have to be smaller. They look pretty terrible this big. And they also need to have less strike, I guess. Damn, still pretty terrible, but I'm getting somewhere. I'm getting somewhere. The particles already have random size variations. It still looks pretty terrible. I don't like it at all. The sand particles look so bad. It... Holy fuck, it looks horrible. How's this in the game? Mexico. The flying on his head. Yeah. I like the mist particle. How does this work? Oh? Coloring this. Huh? Oh. I think this has potential to look better if we make it yellow. No, yellow particles are gonna look terrible. Particle loss at the time, I'm not sure what that means. Damn, I think we need to reduce the velocity a little bit on this. Oh, the drag strength is really strong. That's why this looks so bad. Aha. That's gonna have some influence. Are we listening to fucking whale sounds right now? Yeah, I think it's gonna look a lot better now. What the fuck? Why do they just go in two directions? Oh, it's missing this flag. Oh my god, of course it's gonna look terrible. Okay, now we got something. The offset looks pretty bad. Let's actually do zero random translation on this one. This one to five. They seem to get a little too big for my taste. Make this more blue-yellow and you're good. I guess I could program those yellow particles in. That's way too fast. What's the XP for the electron? I have no idea, man. That's something YouTube just decided to put into the thing. I have nothing to do with that. Is the lifetime not working? That's fine to me. Hello, Xeroclum. Hello, Scazzy3. Why is it so dark when I don't want to thump? Because one looks good and the other looks terrible. It's not finalized. We're gonna look into colored smoke. Let me figure out how I programmed this. I think I had an RGB fade function that writes itself into the primitive color. They're gamifying our parasocial relationship. True. Any level four friends in chat? 0x80 does that. Now we're at B8. I didn't mean to close that. Wait, no, this is good. Initial color. What's a nice yellow color? This feels like a nice yellow. Then we make it darker over time. Seems good. How do you work? I thought I had. I already did this. I did this before. That's why it just won't work. 119 was it? 109. Nhex? Yes. Looks like an explosion. I guess I made it too dark. I actually don't like how much they disperse. I feel like it would look better if they had less forward velocity maybe. But I also feel like they don't fully fade out. That's some bullshit, right? What's going on there? A lifetime multiplied by two. And opacity is just... There's no way this is the only place a lifetime gets updated. Particle despot, I guess. That's what I thought. Physics advances. Physics advances. 0.5? Aha! That is so much better. And now I can make them bigger again. Okay, this will look way better now. Watch this. Yeah, there we go. Where did we take this from? Damn, this is wrong in the entire game. All our particles have to spark. Oh boy. Does the ground particles have to spark? No, the particles are fine. FFF08C. It feels very desaturated. I will do something slightly more saturated than what you said. Syu, Kaza, what are you doing? We are making Mario. Alright, I think we got our star. Now we need to give the star the correct ID. Because we have not done that. I think they are going to have to show us at F3. My grip. I hope you see the fin. I don't have any opposite Mario fit now. I'm just wearing a normal suit. ID is 1 or 0. Alright. Why is the star blue? I don't think it should be blue. There is just no way I have collected that before. It is no longer blue. The trash that mimics completely gone. That depends on how many entries I get. Sometimes I have to put pretty bad entries in or shitpost the entries in rather. Because I just do not have enough to make a presentation without them. Okay, that tried to exit me from the level. Which is an issue. No. You do it. Does this work? I know I can, but we need to see you do it. Maybe the leave option should not be available. Does the stay option work? Neither option works? Are you kidding me? Does it work in levels? Did I break it somehow? This star has an Odyssey feel. Kinda. But I don't think it is an issue. Think about Mario 64. Let's be real. Think about Mario 64. How many stars in Mario 64 can you think of that are less content than what we just did? Okay, that works. Do you guys want to see an insane speedrun? Nevermind. I can't do it. Alright, we're doing it. We're going for it. I can't just let that stand. I'm just so early that I have to wait for the cycle. How cool is that? How cool is that? Resident Evil games, if you're going to call this a noob-friendly run, it's pretty noob-friendly. It's honestly not a difficult speedrun. Anyway, we don't want Mario getting stuck like that. See, none of the other engines have the ranger bar. Nope, none of them have that. What's starting the dialogue here? Yo, thank you for the donation or subscription, whatever that was. I'll need like 5 seconds before it pops up on my screen. What was it? Yo, 5,000 bits, holy shit. Thank you for that, Akano. That's a lot. So this is kind of bad code. But I guess it is what it is. If you wanted to make this more readable, you could just make a separate function or leave comments, I guess. But comments is always it. Huh, that didn't work at all. Oh. It's zero? Oh, okay that actually makes sense. Speedrunning. It still does that. Oh, I see. So something's opening up the dialogue. Okay, it's not here. Maybe for this one, the enum would come in handy. Damn. Oh. Oh, I see. It's the cutscene. Friend level accent dialogue. Damn. Then an order to the nation's effect friend level, but then you have to be gifted. Damn. Different levels. Is that how we're gonna call this now? Make this as parasocial as possible. While Mario is doing that, I also don't want him to start talking to Mario. So let's make that happen as well. Just make it so that for like 10 seconds or so he doesn't talk. Yeah. It's fine, we don't need variable names. Actually, let's do 300. 10 seconds, 10 seconds no talking. You don't collect a star. You have to do the mission again. A star is whether you've done the mission by checking whether you've collected a star. Perfect. It's the next time he's gonna talk to me. Maybe it's not perfect. What did I do? Oh. Maybe this was awful. Yeah, very unlikely someone's gonna destroy all the sandcastles without talking to him, considering how often I accidentally talk to him. Okay, nice, there we go. Go away, come back, he talks again. Oh, and the text needs to update. It's not it. This is not good. So we just have to do that. Alright, just one more time making sure he actually talks to me with the correct text now after I beat the sandcastle off of him. Actually, even after I collect a star, it shouldn't matter. Like they have defiled me. Good, that's what we wanted. Then he should talk some shit about beaches. And then he should be nice to you. Yes, perfect. Sandbump is done. Very nice. We have to bomb spawn coins, why? Why would he spawn coins? How many stars? Probably around 200. Right now, 193 are planned. But I'm under no delusion that we are not going to just add random more stars as we play through. As we program through this overworld. Okay, the next thing, the Goomba King. He appears here after you've beaten his mission in Bunny Brushwoods. He's fishing at the store, still complaining about his inept minions. He never actually catches any fish. He's done being the king. Alright. Do we make the Goomba King do anything, or do we just make him chill here? Think about the whole pirate software situation. Not much. I could tell from early on that the guy is a little annoying. Of course, now people are making grifting videos shitting on his coat. His coat is generally bad, but the videos people make are also kind of bad. He's just one big dog pile right now. So, where are we going to put the Goomba King for fishing? Fishing minigame for a star? I was just going to put him here. Wait, what if he does something stupid? Like he fishes somewhere where there couldn't possibly be fish. What if he has one coin on his fishing pole and you can collect a coin? Or we just put him here on the beach and then he's going to just be fishing. And that's it. That's the whole story. Have him on a floater by me in the water? No. That sounds too much like he's having a good time. Oh, right. Typical biotech model. I guess his shoes are also his crown. Again, I'm going to go insane unless he finishes a Goomba with a snorkel and goggles. Funny, but... I mean, that's a whole ass skit. Is there a way to make a Goomba look bald? I guess the scanner makes him look a little bald. On the bar? What is the bar? He looks kind of bald. You know what's going to look more bald than a literal bald head? Giving him a single hair. Like just a single strand of hair. How do you like a single strand of hair? A bit sideways. It does kind of look intentional, like this doesn't look like it's a haircut he chose.
