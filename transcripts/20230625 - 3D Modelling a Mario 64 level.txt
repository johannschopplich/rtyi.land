You you hello can you hear me now how's it going my microphone was muted I love the FPZ I'm glad you like that we can't hear a thing you can't hear me now what how are you saying you can't hear me okay look at this this was my new idea well actually Zorro organic had this idea a while ago so when Mario falls see how his head like moves a ball isn't that cool turn off our days then I didn't even talk yet voice gets clipped oh my god my old stream just fucking liked so what do you do you visa that's literally a fast 64 buck there's nothing I can do about that that's www.. what are you spamming w to music yeah it's a fast64 fuck look as soon as I jump this happens it's nothing I can do about it I want this to be different though let's try this w animation ac I still want to fine tune it a bit aceboomer look I'm not 12 did you figure out the blue coin switch design nope we did not yeah I also thought it looked jittery so I think this is a bit better yeah I'm still fine-tuning this I think this is a bit better yeah that looks a lot less jittery we also have the new health bar in now look at this starts here and then it goes into the corner someone said it looks a little weird but I'm not 100% yet and whenever you take damage it comes back into the middle like that just to make the player aware of it hello Biobak what's the vibe you get a new health bar and dude Biobak you're gonna love this but when I jump you see how Mars head flies off no scaling no I don't want scaling on this I think scaling would look weird and we got I did this to your health bar movement is a bit slow you could make it at least two times as fast yeah I can easily do that if you want let me check that out right now I have access mate okay wait we need an OST oh yeah I also decided you know we used to think that we want skins I decided we're not gonna have skins skins are gone instead maybe we'll make it so the player can buy shit for Mario's house maybe you will be able to buy like a power star that will give you a double jump and invincibility for like a hundred coins so you can get a star for free just so like the most difficult stars are easy to get sure what the placement either but the animations real good the hut or Mario okay let's listen to music any any wishes that flying up reminds me of some of the more fluid animations in Mario and Super Mario Wonder huh the hat does not get squashed but Mars model as a whole gets squashed when you jump up okay so let's just do like minus 182 which of the before so yeah center like that looks weird oh you want it in the center you're not moving it into the center is fair now that I think about it that could work yeah okay maybe we should move it into the center you center corner corner is gonna be difficult because there's stars in the top left corner and the coins in the other one so let's just move it into the center like fuck it because we already scaled it down right okay no one put Mario RPG okay let's see if I can find like an HD remake of it Mario RPG orchestrated let's do that so pre-rendered shadows back on the menu no why do you give your streams titled so generic what do you want it to be titled Oh how's that buy a bag oh wait that's too low isn't it why is it so low it doesn't even finish the animation what the fuck did I get operator presidents wrong the prison looks fucking insane now all right oh there we go that is perfect look at it you like it that long fall again we're just gone now it's back on the menu you had to learn a lot of barrio law for this level oh that sounds awesome oh yeah I also finished this whole red coin star stream let me show you what the record store is gonna be like so this is gonna be a very smoothie star dude I love that you can jump out of a long jump in the sack it feels so good whoops I'm probably gonna make it so that if you fall into the sea you just lose one HP again you missed it how the health animation I will show you as soon as I take damage again I will shout look by your back look that's gonna be a solid wall in the final game don't worry about it I find that moving around on this oil rig feels really good sentences no one's ever said before can even do like little skips like this if you want if you really want and the most console by here all right I did this your baby coding the game again with the sea thing baby coding wait what that's the pole extend to the hook and stuff no it doesn't what is baby coding wait all right oh oh I see I see yeah okay never mind well did you see the animation but I think I see oh damn it one jumping and this looks weird yeah yeah I see what you mean so I was well why do you need to hack the plan kiss their forehead when they fall in the water because I watched Zayna play it and she would have had to restart the game 15 times so my bar is usually when I watch the player and it's painful to watch them I need to make it easier and it was very painful to watch her I mean I found another way to get one of the coins yeah colors are blending with the oil which colors oh yeah there's also something else I need to talk about then I can just buy 150 safe bubbles in the shop I was gonna give the player like a safe power start and would give you like a double jump and invincibility let me show you there was something else that I could do this level here is really ugly wait the grid platform the colors are blending with the oil that one I don't know I like it I think this is fine I do see some black shadows so that's not good so yeah I looked at this level and I thought it was really ugly just the way the temple looks you like this bit of warrior lore or how big super anyway and hey stop it with the dirty jokes or something I shouldn't say however since it's a good question I'm going to answer 10 plates of liver sauteed with leek 10 crepes 10 plates of rice curry my morning poop was very yellow it was good color and a big one too so yeah I I looked at this level earlier and I thought holy shit this is so ugly for Chris to the colors make no sense this is just color vomit I think we need to do something about this the vegetation is ugly I thought the vegetation was fine I think it's this fucking gray brick here I think colors just don't play well with each other maybe if the sky was more the color of the water or the water was more to cut off the sky the skybox here you didn't make this it's just a gradient you told me that when you were modeling it really and I didn't notice say something about this level is just ass I mean I'd like to have you reworked it the thing is I kind of want to get the colors right like before you rework it too because otherwise you know we might have to like rework it again and again I at least want the colors to be right when you start working on it I said I'm that El Dorado from yeah but we can't make the whole temple goal actually we can't make the whole temple golden yeah no El Dorado from through the edges is very pretty actually can you change the color of the bricks right quick to what like a more golden would that take long to do no I mean I can do a test of that real quick no the level is very pretty shadows I am not worried about that it's just the colors of the level itself are really bad yeah cuz I just want to see what happens if you change it from gray to brown yeah I think that already looks that already starts to look better maybe I mean it's definitely more appropriate Mario colorless be maybe like desaturated a little bit like more more than yellows just looks like piss and then same with the edging well yeah I would have to be the same color like I think that's already a good start I don't know send you a cool water texture on discord that is a very cool water texture I like this one a lot I'm saving this for later this is not like an ancient temple but it also just kind of look bad anyway we are supposed to be working on this level here oh yeah by the way I also okay so since we are reworking what the coins do I'm also thinking maybe they should be able to buy mini games I know mini games historically and Mario hacks have been ass but I think we could make some good ones maybe just like four to get up to 175 stars then again I thought we already had 180 stars I don't know why my list is saying 171 I must be missing something the last test that I put yeah I kind of like the yellow more it's like a Mario color it's more like a Yoshi temple to me so we got the red coin start done here I think it's time to stop programming I'll be honest I played curse mirror I didn't like it at all and I don't even remember there being mini games in that game oh wait that was like a hexagon heap thing but that's about it I invented mini games it was all me but there's okay there's a factor to mini games especially if you look like Donkey Kong 64 or even I know this is in terms of the kingdom a lot of mini games are like oh you're playing this game fuck you here's a different one play that one fucking idiot it's a primary wonder trailer it looks pretty insane and I kind of like it no Mario Elefante no let's start making our guys here we're starting to make the Koopas and all that so we want them to be construction worker Koopas here actually we should decide on the people working here first let's think about the models we need and then we start making the models so we're on the way get the idea for it no that was something that's zero organics is just an image that a long long time ago texture stretched don't see it okay NPCs so definitely Koopas with build a hand Goombas with Bilbo hats. We make like some pop koopas. I think there should be some some bulkier koopas working around. Mmm I don't really want that. We need thwomps that are more of their backs protected so you can't just destroy them. They have like back shields or or vests. Vests? Yeah I like that. Like worker vests. Maybe one of them tells Mario if you talk to him how it's designed to keep people from stomping on them. Yeah yeah exactly. Well if we have it this year I'm not decided yet. I will probably decide during the cross off this week. Okay so someone on the seesaw that can be a koopa. Group of thwomps. We have thwomps. A pool of cement that is blocked off by tape. You can run through it and Mario's footprints stay in the cement. But the cement there gets really upset so that should be a koopa. How do you destroy them then? You don't. I think there should be thwomps too. Thwomps and thwomps. Oh yeah shit I meant thwomps. And thwomps need to be here too for sure. But how do the thwomps look like? Maybe they got like something on the bottom of them for just pounding shit down. Let's look at construction workers and see what we could use to make the thwomp look like that. Or maybe oil rig workers. Oh no not clipart. Koopas in full hazmat suits. No. Full body suits. Cement physics on the N64 amazing. Why is there a woman working on an oil rig? No it was an experiment it's for social media. Obviously. Mm-hmm. Are we gonna happen? Because that will mean that F3 survived E3. True. Metal from Mega Man. Why would I google him? Okay fine I'll do it. Metal Mega Man. He's kind of cute. But we don't need them. Trump's got a drill bit on the bottom. No. Construction design wise and he kind of fits it. Yeah yeah he's got. I mean but we're already thinking of the helmet right? I'm just thinking of a way to make the thwomps look like right. Yeah the thwomps. Like how would we design the thwomps? Maybe we make them like full of oil. So they're like all shiny. Yeah. Maybe we should ask Chanchipiti. It actually comes up with insane ideas. Are we gonna use the original thwomps or are we gonna use the modern thwomps? We used the N64 ones. All right. Okay we have the thwomps. Two people carrying a piece of glass and you smash through it. So these should probably be Koopas. Kick an oil barrel in the slope and have all the workers like down on it. Where's that part? Oh right so there's gonna be people standing here and there's gonna be an oil barrel here and you can kick it over to just have them fall down. I think it'd be funny if the thwomp just broke the glass while the Koopas were carrying it. But why would he do that? How do you do that? Because like something at the bottom triggers him to go down. That's how they work right? They always go up and down. Yeah they always go up and down. So like maybe the oil like that little oil plant leads to where the thwomps are like working. No no it's too complicated to do that. Just have the Mario dash for the glass. I think that's funnier. Give them different warning sign plates on every side. Oh that's funny. I like that. You know what? Yeah that's better. Thwomps with warning signs. And there has to be an overseer just like overseeing the whole building station here. The overseer is gonna be here and every time something bad happens he's gonna get more and more upset. And I think a wiggler is perfect for that. He changes emotions. Yeah he's gonna get more and more red. Yeah. And every time you mess with them he's just gonna yeah. So wiggler with a he's gonna have a construction helmet on every one of his pieces. I think that's funny. He has to protect his entire body. Yeah and also Koopa janitors. No the cement is just gonna be harder to walk through and Mario will leave stamps on there. Is that all we need? Just six NPCs? I think six NPCs is good. Should we program the cement pit first? I think this one's gonna be the funniest to program. Let's do this one. I'm not making a video on a fixed wiggler model. I'm not making a video on every little thing I do. So big rotating metal thing. It's kind of fitting yeah. But where would that even be? Oh that would be like a cool thing to just have up and down here. Maybe we should use the tox box. Hmm I kind of like this idea. A thwomp attached to a crane is also a very cute idea. We could have this exchanged for a thwomp. You know what let's do it. Yeah I'll attach a thwomp here. Your idea is better. Is the Nether name officially oily boily ocean? We're thinking of oily boily bay. Yes the cement will work like slow sand, Clayman. Hello have you been here in the YouTube series before, Clayman? Is this a world first? Hmm Now if I have the tox boxes I'm just thinking of locations to put them. So this could be a location for them. Up here could be a location for them. These are all prime locations for it. And we just can't have it only be in one spot because that would be pretty boring. This would be a decent location for it. One thing that will be an issue with them though is that the rotation of the slope here is a bit weird. But we can just ATAN it. It should be fine. All right let's do the cement pit. Any thoughts for a second demo? It'd be fun to release a demo of the original three levels again just like with all the improvements. But I'm not gonna make a banger demo than that. Which quest is this? 11. I'll think of this. Or do we best do the cement overseer? If we want the footsteps to stick around until you reset the game we need to store their positions in memory somehow. It'd be easy to just spawn a bunch of decals on top. I tried smart water, city water and electrolytes. Nothing else in it. Good for working out. I have not. Okay we have a problem here with the cement pit. What if the player just keeps running around back and forth? Eventually there's going to be so many decals that the game is just going to like to shit and also it's going to be impossible to store all of them. Make them fade out. Yeah they have to fade out after a bit. That's the only solution that actually works without completely breaking everything. That sucks. Devastating. So my approach to the particles is the same. You mean material batching? Yeah it's just gonna be one dynamic display less. That won't even be an object. Or actor as we industry professionals call it. It's right. I am an Unreal Dev now. I call them actors. So I work in Sonic Adventure and Roadcoast. Oh I didn't even know that. That's kind of neat. Turn up a limit and delete the oldest decal. That works too but I think fading them out is easier. If we fade them out then the overseer guy being angry doesn't make sense. So I think just having a limit of them is easier or better. Stores array with separate variable for the newest position. When reaching the end of allocated memory wrap around. Resulting involves ordering overwritten. Yeah that's the same as just having an upper limit and deleting the oldest. Maybe add some oil stains around the level. They don't even have to do anything just to make the level look a lot more alive. Yes. Yeah I mean it's all the same idea. Did you take that to a cement pit full of footsteps and remove all decals? There won't be a step and it flips over. Do you think players will notice fading out cement footprints? Yes. Render to a texture? No. Do you know how low res n64 textures are? No. Okay so actually what I want to do. I want this to be an array that's only loaded in the level specific data. So we're gonna have to make a new file in the level. Let's just load it here. No this is just an orchestrated version of the Mario RPG OST. There's cement physics and toy stories too on the n64. That's insane. I could Julius but I really don't want to. We don't have that much EEPROM size. And also would have to be persistent on memory at that point. Where is? Here. Cement. Let's see. So move this up actually. So how many footsteps do we store? Um at 32. Cement steps three. Realistically every footstep is gonna be two triangles. And I don't really want this to render more than like 100 triangles. So we're gonna have to store this. Maybe more realistic if the footsteps fade out. Maybe? Okay but wait now that I'm thinking about this again what if we actually render to a texture? Because we wouldn't have to store all this. Let's test that how that would work out. Like we could just have this be two textures and then have to be like 127 by 63. Oops. Yeah 177 by 64. So how would a footstep look like? I don't know kind of ugly though. Maybe. Let's get a footstep texture. Um oh yeah I developed a head on time once this week. I was paid for it. It was very fun. I don't even know if I'm allowed to show it off. I don't know either. I don't know when I'm supposed to publish it either. So what do you think your hack is complete? 71.8. Ancient Mario's foot. I'm fine. Oh my god. So nice try watermarks. So this would probably have to be like four by three. So yeah I see the footstep. Beautiful. It's a footstep. Yep I am going to lose it. Size is that image right now? Four by eight. At that point I could just make it myself in like five seconds. I mean these are decent looking. Kind of. I guess. Did you hear the song through my speakers? No I just know the sad song is playing because the chat says it is. Oh. Yes I share a brain cell with your speakers. I want it this way. Is that significantly bigger than Mario's footstep? Bowser's outing animation. Are you allowed to say if there's anything that you work in with the uh I don't know. I don't know if I'm allowed.  we have some end guys missing. Um yes that is missing. So there might be some decent footprint sprites from the TMNT games on NAS or Gameboy. TMNT. Oh yeah did you notice the coin collection sound is gone? It no longer exists when you enter the thing. Huh where did my texture go? I wanted to compare the size of Mario's footprint to this. Oh. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Have a compound with all three? Yes it's bad. Let's use OS that's way better on N64. Okay so these are a bit big for Mario's footsteps. So we need to go even lower rest than this.  I feel like if we want this idea to look good it's gonna be very difficult. Can you draw a 4x3 footprint? Draw them manually? I can't draw. But I can. Can you draw a 4x3 footprint? 4x2 actually. 4 pixels by 2 pixels. Oh my god I'm doing 4x3. I don't think you have that much resolution. I have like a pixel space worth of resolution. Actually I can make this more textures. Wait let me find the right size first. It's literally just pixels on the screen. That doesn't really work. I don't like it. You asked for 4x3. I gave you 4x3. Yeah but it doesn't look good. Can I just make you a footprint texture that isn't shit? If you make it the right size yeah. It can't be 4x3 can it? I'm experimenting with it right now, but this is not like an easy thing to pull off. Why not just get the UV stun and then clamp? Because then the texture's gonna repeat and you're gonna step in one spot and it's gonna make multiple footprints on the tongue. Let's just run in some Tricep. No, no no no, this will be better. I'm actually very convinced of it now. This way we don't have a limit on the footprint either. Does that seem to be the right size? Does this look right, Zeina? The size-wise? Yeah, looks about right. Oh, right. Definitely PC port. I knew it, Kaze was using the PC port. All right, you have 4x3. But look, this actually looks kind of fun. In-game it looks okay. I just squint my- Actually, yeah, that's fine. I think it'll be fine. Maybe. I'm not a big fan of it though. I think it'll be fine and it kind of sucks. It does. Hmm. It's like a Messiah cross, but in-game it looked fine. Okay, it looks bad here, but in-game? Again, that kind of looks like a footprint. No? Yeah, it looks like a footprint. It's decent. I like it. And if we do it this way, then we can also add additional textures for like Mario diving or like ground pounding. Do you want to make one for Mario ground pounding? Zeina? Yeah? Do you want to make one for Mario ground pounding like this? So just like leave a stamp in there? Stamp of respect? Yeah. I can certainly try. I think we should have one for dive and one for ground pounding too. Oh, sorry. Clearly 15 FPS. And then we'll just have three of these textures here. Four of those. Okay, we'll be 127 by 63 each. So can you resize the sizes? For everything? Yes. Okay, well I have to guess here. So four by three, no actually three by four footstep. Let's see Mario's butt compared to his feet is maybe like two and a half times as big. So maybe like eight by 12. Butt stomp and maybe like a 12 by 12 dive. Actually also 8 by 12 dive. Okay, I also need to find the proper combiner here. That makes it look like the footsteps are actually just like on the floor here. We should have different world slide speed when starting the world slide depending on how much velocity Mario has when he starts doing the world slide. He does. At least I'm pretty sure he does. Hashtag external rate. Oh my god, we are getting raided. Keep calm everyone. We have a storm of messages coming through right now. Who's the supervisor gonna be? Womp womp. It's gonna be a wiggler because the supervisor's gonna get angry so it has to be a wiggler. I don't understand how the brightness here is not just one. I'm gonna match the color for finishing the pit. It's just gonna be a decal so it's just gonna be like slightly darker ground. Yeah, for some reason in texture zero it's just one. All right, so it's probably gonna be something like this. So it just looks like it's gonna get dark. How is the footstep the only thing that's dark? Oh wait, okay. That's not good though. We need one minus texture zero alpha and that's all. Is that not possible? I guess we can just use print color alpha. Yeah, so now we just got a decal of his feet in there. And then we just make a big big texture. Can we just use large texture mode? Wait a second, wait a second. Isn't large texture mode using some special thing? How about large texture mode is complete shit. Oh man. This might work. What is that Mario 64 level amazing? Is it for RTYI? Yes, it is. Okay. You're gonna be able to leave footprints in here. Hopefully this exports. You never know with large texture mode. Nope. Oh, actually that's my bad. No, it should. Oh, it worked. Cool. The fast 64 tab. Where is it? Oh, there we go. All right, let's try that. What did that do? But wait, what's the point of this? How's this gonna help? Does that mean I can get one extra pixel of resolution? Okay, let's see if this works. So we have 255 multiplied by 127. If the tool is correct, then this will work. If the tool is incorrect, then it will not. Usually it does not work. I'll just be saying that much. Okay. Interesting. It just told me that the texture size is not even valid. Cool. Let's ditch that tool. I don't want it anymore. This is meta. I'm using the large texture mesh tool. No. Okay, so let's get this on white underground. So what would we do here? Do we multiply the previous pixel colors with this? I think that might work best. Are you saying that it works perfectly? That is nice for you. It's gonna be as orangey, so it makes sense, based on the line, for it to not just be totally grey. Yeah. Nice. Okay, let me rename this material so I can find it. And export. And, oh shit, we also need to export just the texture once, just so I have it. Make it grey, the cement. The cement is grey. It's just that there's light coming from the top, and the light makes it look orange. It's like the same as the dress, so you can add footsteps on top of footsteps. What? Oh, I see, I see. Yes, I can do that. Yeah, cement is no longer required. So... Yeah, I like this. This song sounds kind of shitty. Is that what they were going for? I think you just export the texture in a separate file now. Maybe. But, I mean, this is like no extra work, so... Hello, Beta, Matza here. Let's fucking go.  Oh, shit, I kind of want the cement back now. Now that I think about it. No, actually, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me get the cement back. I'll just write it all into this texture. It's easier that way. Let's go further. Oh, we have another issue. We need to rotate the footsteps by Mario's walking direction. Shit, how do you rotate the image? Or we make them circular. I think that might be the easiest. We just make a thing that's like symmetric in all directions. What's wrong? How am I supposed to rotate this image when I apply it onto the texture? I would need to write an image rotation algorithm, which, I mean, we can't do that. But it's like a lot of work. Look it up online. I guess we can't do that. Let's just try that. Fuck it. We'll start by just making it non-rotated for now, and then we just rotate it as soon as we have to figure it out.  yeah, we need to find the boundaries for the cement.  that'll be dark. So... Man, this is so much work for just a single stupid star. So, what did you guys think of the sine cosine video? Did y'all like it? I feel like that's something you would like too better. I sometimes like random math stuff. We've song donation set up. I don't know how. Shit, I need to figure that out. Shit! YouTube set up song donations. I have made a note to do that now. You've not seen it? Damn! Function I may not be initialized. Sure, buddy. So... Horizontal first, and it's only three. So... Shit! This is... It's I8, right? So the pixels are all fucked. Oh my god, I need to... No, I'm making this an I8, and then I'm just dividing by 16. It's an I8. Okay, perfect. Wait, if this is an I8, then this should be 12 numbers. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Oh, nice. Okay, saved. Nice. Oh my god, I also need to... How do I even convert this to... It's three horizontally, so I need to figure out whether it's offset first or not. Oh my god. I just woke up from an all-nighter. Damn. Was it fun though? I love all-nighters. You sent me something? All-nighters are kind of fun. Rotating a bitmap. Do you think we can do an all-nighter at some point? Or do you think that's probably not a good idea? No. What is this shit? That doesn't help at all, Lila. This is doing shit. This is not actually properly rotating it. Unless you rotate by a multiple of 90 degrees, it's just gonna be terrible. Of course, there's a variable for Mars Direction. You don't understand rotation? Oh, fuck Twitch. See, I think Twitch is going down. I think Twitch has made the decision to just squeeze out the last bit of money from the platform they can before it inevitably just burns down to the ground. Because they are shitting on the user experience to extract more money. Which one's the longer one? Z is the longer one. So, the x-coordinate will be computed from the z-coordinate. Cool. No, it's dying. True. Can you tell me that? Yeah but what you just gave me was gonna be way worse than terrible. I could probably get a better quote from Chachibity. I'll use neither an Aery nor a Pointer. Oh wait. Yeah, it's not gonna be an expensive algorithm no matter what. Shouldn't you inline the function? Maybe. I don't know yet how it's gonna look like in the end. So we don't inline it yet. Umm. Independent operands. Oh wait. What are these arrows!? There's a semicolon everywhere. It's telling me this is an invalid operand and this is an arrow type. This is a bad experience to have. Let me just see. Is this fine? Oops. This is fine. This is fine. Oh. Oops. There we go. Wait, you can't end with a floating point? That is stupid. I want to be able to end with a floating point. Okay, so since it's 3 pixels vertically, if the x-coordinate and 1 is true, then we'll be offset by 4 bits into the first pixel. So... We need to find the destination texture first. We haven't done that yet. Cement pit. Here's the texture. The fuck!? What? Where's the new texture? Do you not want to load a texture for this texture maybe? Leila? What is going on? You made this. Oh, it loads it in the mesh? Okay, that makes sense for large texture modes. So is this actually just the whole texture like that? That's kind of cool that the N64 can do that. You did what? You did this. You made FAST64. I've seen you do it. You have me thinking, how do I make a fucking pretty texture? Yeah. How do I do this? I don't know. Sauron, damn. Dude, I'm gonna ask Sauron more about the custom microcontroller shit. I gotta make more of that myself. I think we have to just not loop over Y, because it's too weird with 8-bit modes. Let's do this one first. Oh shit, we have to do every 4-bit unit individually, because... I guess that's how life is. What if we just divide by the float once? Like so. Just like a tiny micro-optimization. Seems it's a few divisions. Now we need this. J undeclared, obviously. I should have made sure one pixel worked first before I do all of this. Now I need to copy-paste this everywhere. God damn. Let us make sure that one pixel works first before I do all of them. Or I rather want it for the prints. Fuck it. And now only every other foot should work, but that's fine. We actually don't need to divide by 16.5. We can just... End with 0x00. Hello, Maya Goldberg. You're wearing a Yoshi shirt right now? Very, very cool. Invalid operands, why? Float and int. I already float and int. I'm casting U8 right here. Right there. What are you, blind? Or is it this one? Hey, it works! Okay. Next line. Oops. So now we need to do the second line of this. So we actually do need to divide by 16.5 here. Multiply by 16.5. And then 0xF. And we end with 0xF0. And then we have one more of these lines here. But instead of Y coordinate plus I, it's Y coordinate plus I plus X coordinate shifted by 1. Plus 1. Plus 1. I multiply it by 3. Plus 2, actually. And this one is plus 1 already. And this one is also plus 1. Okay, now every other footstep should show up if we did everything right. What? What? What? What? What are your thoughts on all the Mario 64 games you want to work on in the future? What's going on with the Mario 64 DS team from Twitter? The DS team basically barely even started and they already died. And the Mario Bros. project, they had commissioned me for a fair bit of work on it. And I would do more work on it if they actually wanted me to. I also need to make sure Mario is in range here. Nice. I wish there was a faster way to just check for boundaries. I mean there is, but it takes a lot longer to type out and I don't wanna. I hate Mario's snoring sound so much. It's like the least pleasant sound in the world. I remember one time I was working on a romhack and while I was working my PC froze. And there was just like the thwomp sound. I filmed the thwomp snoring and Mario was snoring and then there was the merry-go-round song playing. It was the worst experience of my life. And I had to hold down a button during that time. Because otherwise I would have lost progress so I couldn't think of my headphones. I do not listen to Limp Bizkit. Kids named Macross. Yeah, Macross would work. I think when I make the multiplayer one I'm just gonna make it so that the objects all get the closer Mario state as the G-Mario state. And the closer Mario object is the Mario object. Just as like a shortcut to make every object work. It doesn't have any footprints yet. Okay, let us do some printing to debug this. I mean it is not unexpected that it doesn't work right away because this is not like a super easy code to make. Zero. All zero. Cool. Oh. I know why. I forgot the multiplicator. I want to rotate. But wouldn't two rotation functions only allow half the animation to be the same? Maybe. Oh shit! Well, there's definitely footprints appearing. And the coordinates look right to me. Can you ROM hack Neskims? I can. Can you? Actually I haven't done it yet. I would probably learn how. RetroChef, you talk to CackyDev like he's a normal person. You have to know when he's here he's always memeing. He just told me that I listen to them biscuit. I don't. That was the buttstomp. It's very very tiny. Let's see. S. Okay. That kinda works but what resolution is this? 8x12. That's 8x12? Yeah. Really? Yes. What? 8x12 pixels. Oh yeah it is. Alright. This can work out. It's for reference. Oh I see the image, yeah. Yeah. I thought this could be a little more... Kinda like this? Yeah. A little wider? Because it makes Moritz's ass look so skinny. He's got a huge ass though. This is the full resolution of it. With his buttprint. Let's see. Oh. Cool.  This is certainly a texture I've had to make. Let me get a bit lighter. Like this. I'd like to see someone using the Super Mario World source code in C found somewhere to patch up the core pack to work better. I don't want anything to do with Mario Bros 2, 3 and World. I hate those games. Yeah. Yes. Dude have you guys played the DS Yoshi's Island? It is so bad. It wasn't that bad. It is the worst and actual insult to Yoshi. This man also hates video games by the way. I'm not gonna deny that. I wonder if... Hey why do I never know the operator order? Crazy. I should be knowing this. The DS one or the 3DS one? It was called like Yoshi's New Island or something. Or was it called Yoshi's New Island? It was the one where there was Baby Wario, Baby Donkey Kong, Baby Peach and all that shit. The DS one? Yoshi's Island DS? Could be. That is Yoshi's Island DS. Yeah it's terrible. That's the best way around.  New Island was pretty alright. What? The game just makes you go back and pick up the shitty baby all the time. And then you just need it. That's like a key. It doesn't actually exist as like an entity within the world. It's just a key. That cripples you for carrying it. Because you're not running with Mario. Because you can't run. Because you don't have Mario. Oh, it's just Yoshi's Island but shitty, huh? It just took an old game and made it worse. I'm gonna agree to disagree with him on that. I don't think it's that bad of a game. At least not to the extent that he's making it out to be. It's terrible.   It's terrible. Let me just get a few less footprints here so I can better see what's going on. Do I have to make the footprints too? No, I already made some. Alright. You need one for the dive. Yes. But you have to keep in mind the dive is gonna constantly apply, so... You have to figure out how to best deal with it, you know? He fucked it up, this is probably a bit much. I'm gonna hold on that and go back to animating Bowser being a pouty boy. Alright. Hello, Ladingo. Oh yeah, this is barely even looking like a footprint right now. And it's also... is it going to the wrong coordinates? Let's see where the coordinates really are. How can I tell where the coordinates really are though? I would need a different texture. Actually, you know what, if that was the issue it would be very easy to tell. I don't think that's the issue. Any thoughts on the Sam & Max series? Never heard of it. Nope, we're still doing the black boss. Feet prints. Yes, they are feet prints. Let me just move to Sierra so we also have this. Yes, this code is human readable. Why is this not working? Expecting the expression before what? Oh, let me do this. I do not remember Mario 64 HD. I was thinking of just remaking Mario 64 and Unreal Engine just to fuck with everyone. Just to like, fuck with the PC board. Just to see it all crumbling down. To see the desperation. Where am I? I'm pretty well. Yesterday, me and my partner came recently from Netherlands. But the day before we managed to visit Blender Foundation. I didn't know they had a real physical building. That's kind of cool. Are you happy with my Discord friend request? No. I have 77 friend requests right now. You go into my collection. You have been collected. You're collecting the friend requests. Yes. But why would you even bother making Unreal Mario though? Just because I hate people telling me to use the PC board. Then I can be like, look, if I wanted my game to be PC only. And have nicer graphics, I would just use Unreal Engine. And not like a shitty, garbage emulated PC version of Mario. I feel like that would be a really good April Fool's joke. Yeah. I think maybe we have to save that for next year. Or you could do it for the summer. You've already been hired. Oh shit, I can't find it. Hmm. So it is getting the right coordinates. We know that. But it's not printing to the right places. Although I want to see if adding the second part of the coordinate would also appear like everywhere else now. Mr. Punchline. Yeah. UTF has a lot of delay though, actually. It's crazy. This seems inverted. Yeah, so one corner also seems to affect the other. And it's drawing to three different places at once. I need to multiply 128. No, 126. Damn, I should have made a define for this. I will, actually. Yes, replace 126 by 126. That is exactly what I wanted to do. It's 127. Oh, but I have a define. I'm not going to deal with Unity. I am just using Unreal right now. Yeah, that is actually true. Unreal Engine is so terrible. I don't know why.  I don't know why people say it's good. It's actually ass. If you move an object around. If you move like an invisible object around. Just like a random actor component. It is going to cause mayhem. Wait a second. Was that the entire thing wrong with it? And the mirroring? Oh. I think we've got it. And you set text match alpha threshold again. You set the blend color alpha. But beware. It has a minimum of like 0.25? 1.25? 32? You know what I mean. Oh, that's cool. Let's go. I did not expect this to be so easy. It already looks decent if you ask me. We can make it a lot better still. You know. Oh shit, what was that? Oh no. The darkness is coming. The void. Is there space between footsteps? Yeah, we didn't do that at all yet. I just wanted to get the coordinates right. GDP set blend color. Yeah, but beware. There is a minimum of 32. Now the problem is that the X coordinates were not centered at all. And neither were the Y coordinates. So we need to make sure that they get centered properly. And that... The coordinate is a minimum away from something. We could just make the texture bigger. And scale it up slightly. No, this is really cheap on Vive Console. No, Farzana, this is actually just a texture. We are rendering to a texture. So there is no memory issue. You can make the whole thing black if you want. That's the cool thing about this. Wait, why am I right-shifting the source text before? What the fuck? I don't want that at all. Why did I do that?  Why did I do that? I don't want that at all.  I don't want that at all. Why am I dividing by 16.2? I see what I was doing. Oh no. Oh no. Okay, we need to make a few changes. First change. So right now we are taking the texture. We are multiplying it by another texture. And then we are dividing by all this. We don't need that. It's actually enough to just... Take the texture. Why are we taking the alpha pixel of both of them? That's wrong. It should be 0xf here. So... This is enough. I mean, that didn't add any input computations. But still, it's good to have. Okay. Then the next we have 0xf0. And now we need to divide by 16. We don't even need to divide by 16.5. Yeah, because we are just scaling down. That's practical. That's kind of neat. I didn't think of it like this before. But this will just work. And compile arrows. I fucked my brackets somewhere. 0xf2. Why did I fuck my brackets? What was it before? Hey! It's starting to look like the footsteps that we wanted. Let's see. If I keep running in a circle... Will it make it more and more dirty? Oh my god, this looks so good! Wait until we rotate the feet. Mario makes art with his feet. Man, the camera rotates so slow, I can't just hold the direction and have it work. Nice! I wanted it to get dirtier and dirtier, but I guess that doesn't work. I'm lucky. We also need to tie this to Mario's animation too. And offset it depending on his animation. By now it's always offset a bit downwards, right? Is it offset anywhere else? It should be offset too. Yeah, it should be offset forward or backwards. Too many footsteps? Nope! I want the player to make this many footsteps. Just have them be able to make the entire thing black. I think that's cool. I think that's cool. Look, if the PlayStation survived piracy, then I'm sure the Dreamcast wasn't killed by that. I didn't buy a single PlayStation game, but I had a full binder full of burned PlayStation games. That I found behind a dumb stunt and burned myself. Because I was four years old. Wait, why are there too many footsteps there? How can there be too many footsteps? Explain! It looks wrong? It looks great to me. It looks great to me. Am I still touching the ground that much? Oh, that's what you mean. I thought you wanted a limit on the amount of footsteps. Yeah, of course. I didn't even do that part yet. I'm doing that right now, actually. Let's see if they are big enough. How many times has Mario stepped on the floor? I don't know. Probably every two or three frames. So if they're bigger than 60, maybe? Step count It's not actually step count. This is like the opposite of the step count. Step frequency would have been a better word. Step count Did you fix Autocorrect yet? Nope. I still don't know how to do it. Waiting for someone to get so annoyed at them to just tell me how to do it. Waiting for someone to get so annoyed at them to just tell me how to do it. So we need to offset them, alter the rating. And the offset should be based on... Ideally, it would be based on Mario's walking animation, but I don't want to program all that logic. So let's just do Opacity here. Let's just do Opacity here. Let's just do Opacity here. Wrong variable. Alright, Leela. Now look at this and tell me if you like the amount of footsteps. Alright, Leela. Now look at this and tell me if you like the amount of footsteps. Send a tutorial and chat it didn't work. That was a stupid tutorial. Yeah, the offset isn't right. In fact, I can't tell an offset at all. Do you guys see an offset? It's a very slight offset here. It's not enough. VS Code that has a 0x configuration that supplies for C. It didn't work. Why is it so shitty?  Am I offset not enough? That doesn't really make any sense. It's not like a config thing that went wrong in my repo, it's just VS Code 1 they just decided to break. And I also don't know how to copy a config, like even if I wanted that. Have you updated VS Code? Well yeah, that's what broke it. You see them randomness? I think they should just be alternating between left and right properly. I don't like the random offset now. Steps are very predictable on how they move. There shouldn't be a random offset. So pass the dhx to 0, yes. Config is a file. You can load a config file in VS Code? Where would I copy it to? Where does VS Code even store a config file? The extensions? What extensions? I just installed VS Code and just want a picture of a gosh dang hot dog. Do I look like I know what a jpeg is? I just want a goddamn compiled file. What is the problem? You told what happened, not a random. I'm not googling it. I hate dealing with tech issues, I'll just leave it as is. I don't need extensions for C. I had never installed an extension in my life and it worked. It just stopped working. I'm not installing anything, it used to work. Before I installed anything it worked. Hello MarioGuy. The texture size when rotating? That's not an issue that would happen because our textures are an 8x12 size. So whatever you said was just not an issue. Besides we're applying this to a 245x126 texture so that issue wouldn't be a thing anyway to begin with. Because in ZenFunctions I use several times every frame in Mario animations and the position of my object on the map it doesn't make sense that only improves less than 0.1 FPS. Yep. It did not used to work, it did. I don't need extensions. Look, it tells me identifyF32 is undefined. It is defined, right here. How do I need an extension for that? It knows it's there, it's still giving me an error. You don't need an extension for that. It says it right here, type def float and then right here it's red. You can tell that without an extension. It is not my fault. Then you must have uninstalled the extension. That is possible. But what extension are we talking about? What the fuck? It's still in a straight line. Even though I am offsetting it by 150. Is opacity, opacity has to be initialized to 0. Yeah, there's like a whole B0 thing going on. There's no way it's not 0. Just, just to be, just like a sanity check, set it to 0. C++ language support extension. Okay, how do I install it? Which button do I press? Click on the blocks on the left and we will find out. Blocks on the left. Blocks. It's right here. No, I still want to do proper rotating mirror. It's literally installed. Flashing debug position need to fix that. Are you thinking, okay, what if, what if I kind of want the flashing debug position so that I can actually debug my code? Is that okay? Click the blocks on the left and search for it. You mean C? Search for what? Oh God. Wait, reload required?  Does it work now? If it works now, that'd be so funny. Nope. It's still broken though. Okay. I'm allowed to use the debug thing. Well, thank you. Why is this not offsetting? Am I going insane? I'm offsetting this by 1500 now. Now I should be able to see it. Oh my God. Did your mom just find out about the war? Dang. Must have ruined her day. The offset is just not applied. It's just completely ignoring the offset. How can this be? Wait. Wait.  Is this because I'm passing in a U16? Wait, this is not even, no. No, this shouldn't be an issue. Character selection might be a thing. Like the star select screen or something. Putin took my offset? He must have. Wait. I'm printing the offset now. This is crazy.  This is not even. I'm printing the offset now.        The offsets is rendering look right. Can you guys actually read the numbers? I can. The offsets it's rendering are perfectly normal. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Ehhh.  No! How did I do? I set up the whole function because I knew I was gonna have to offset them at the end. But then the function itself, I forgot. But... Yes, I can fix that, but I don't wanna. What for? There we go. So right now, the footsteps are rotated so that the texture is supposed to look good when you walk this way. And I think it does. Yes. It's the amount of steps Mario takes roughly even to the amount. It's roughly the same amount of footprints, right? It looks good to me. Looks good. Alright, time to rotate the texture. Shit, how am I supposed to rotate the texture? See, okay, we run into an additional issue now. When we rotate the texture, the dimension is going to be 4x3 instead of 3x4, like if it's 90 degrees. And we have the problem that this is hardcoded to work with 3 pixels vertically. So we would have to make it like a 5x5 canvas, rotate the canvas and then hardcode the canvas to work fine. Or maybe even 6x6. If you think about it, let's say we have a 4x4, then 4 multiplied by the square root of 2 is going to be 5.6, which is roughly 6. So a 4x4 footstep texture is gonna fit perfectly into a 6x6 grid. Just make the texture circular so you don't need to rotate it. That was also an idea. You like the memory? Oh shit, I need to fix that too. You are correct. Alright, let's fix the memory corruption first. I think that is more important. Kaki has a valid point here. But why only one footprint per step and not a pair? Okay, I want you to go outside into sand and take a single step. And I want you to tell me whether a single footprint appeared or a pair of footprints. They are not gonna fade now, they are there forever. Yeah, making it circular is reasonable, but we also have the buttstomp texture and the dive texture. And you are gonna be able to make footprints with any of them. But memory corruptions? The problem is that these coordinates can go outside the bounds of the texture and that will cause memory corruption to happen. Wait, the easiest way to fix that would be to just add useless memory to the texture. And that would be super easy to do. Oh, but we also have the issue that it wraps around. Who cares if it wraps around on one end, right? It's fine. Hmm. The Y coordinate is the thing that could be an issue.  So... We start at the Y coordinate and then we go down from there, right? So the Y coordinate needs to be minimum 0, maximum 126, minus 4. So... Let's try this. This should prevent the memory corruption. Let's try.  This function is called so rarely that it doesn't matter for FPS. Is this still causing memory corruption? Seems to kind of be causing it. But I'm at 123, so that's the 122 minimum. Fucking hungry, holy shit. Get some chicken tendies. Dude, I had Squaw for the first time today and holy shit, that's so good. They should sponsor me for saying that. Yeah, I've never been to Dairy Queen before in my life. I feel like a caveman being introduced to civilization for the first time. Yeah. From just making footprints in the cement? No, from eating cotton candy ice cream. Chicken fries? What the fuck is chicken fries? Why does it sound tasty? You know what, I want to make the footsteps circular so I don't have to deal with rotating them. I think rotating them is just overkill. We're making them circular, it's fine. No one cry about this, please. Make it so that footprints fade away. Why would you want them to fade away, though? Isn't it cooler if they just stay? There's a point to them staying, right? Yes. I have had coffee for 10 Hortons. Can you get me a cup of coffee, please?   He also hates coffee, so I don't think that applies to him. Yeah, Tim Hortons, or coffee in general, is just fucking disgusting. I don't know how people can eat that. Eat it. Eat.  I wouldn't be better without it. I wouldn't be better without it. I said what I said. I wouldn't be better without it. It's got the flavour of the chocolate. And you know it. I do not. He knows nothing about baking. Lol, Canadian. Canadian detective. Oh, Canadian. I have a Canadian car up on my bookshelf. He can't see, and he's really cute. I've made them circular now. Still looks good to me. Alright, next step, ground pound. The ground pound has to be rotated, though. Ah, shit. Unless we skip on the ground pounds. Or if we make the ground pound also circular. Think you can make the ground pound circular? How the fuck do I make it circular? Kinda like Mario's Shadow, I guess. No, but then you won't get the funny butt print. Yeah. But programming the rotation is gonna be a lot. Think it's a bit overkill for this. Probably. Yeah. Makes it into one circle. Ripped funny butt print. Yeah. Maybe you can give it a bit of depth. Right now I wanna test if it actually gets any darker. And if everything is accessible. Yeah, actually this looks a lot darker than the other side, doesn't it? This could be a cool mechanic in a snow level, too. But it would be super expensive to do this over a whole level. Unless we actually fade out the footprints. Yeah. This could be a cool mechanic in a snow level, too.  There's two circles next to each other. That could kinda work, but is that actually the shape of Mario's butt? Test on N64 for this. I'm good. We'll see it on N64 someday, don't worry about it. I feel like something like this should also cause a lot of circles to appear. Like any of the sliding engine states. Yeah, let's make a few nodes here. So... Hmm... So... When sliding... Add a lot of... Or add... Two... No. Three... No. Four circles in a row next to each other. Parallel to Mario. And then... When ground pounding... Add two circles next to each other. Parallel to Mario. Alright. We have to be at your parents' for what time? 5 o'clock? 5.30? Okay. We should probably head out soon, then. Which means we finish this next time, unfortunately. This was a really fun thing to do, though. This is gonna be fun to look more into. And once we have the circles, then we can do all the effects. And then we'll add the Koopa with the helmet. And he's gonna oversee this. And once you go on there, the Koopa's gonna really, really upset you. Can read from the render texture, too, of course. You know, we can make it so that the player can draw anything they want. And yeah, we can do stuff based on the vector conditions. Anyway... I'll see you guys in the next stream. Until then, bye bye! Bye bye!
