Hello? Hello, ex-fear-of-darkness. Fear of darkness. Hello? Thank you for the sub, SonicTheHedgehog. Hello, GoofyGooba. Hello, Snorkatz. I did get a little bit of work done off-screen. Then I made animations for these guys. Still some fix to fix, but we'll get there. Our mission today is the Wumpa. Squishy stash. Squishy stash. Squishy stash. Now what needs fine-tuning for Ultima 8? Fine-tuning? Fine-tuning is very specific. I guess course 13, 14 and 15 haven't really been tested that much yet. And there's some levels Biomech is still reworking, and I guess the game design will probably need more fine-tuning after that. Any OST wishes for today? Anything good? Only coming out of my subwoofer in an earbud audio is fine. What the hell? Block? I feel like we've listened to Block already. Let's try it. Wasn't you as well last time that suggested Block? Block's strongest warrior? So like 150 forward and 500 to the side. I don't know man, that's weird. Then like PS1 port of Mario 64 or Mario 64 mod. Bro, Marshall Davis, you come in here sometimes and you say the most confusing things I've ever heard. I'm not sure. The limit's very high, I'm assuming. I have no idea. I don't think your IDE matters at all. I've been using Windows Notepad for the longest time. Only recently switched to this. Well, recently as in like 4 years ago. But the first 12 years, Windows Notepad. Not 12 years, 8 years. Actually it's more like 13 years now. PS1 port of Mario 64 and Arrows? That is correct. It is a very early port. Let's try it. Fallen was 23 when we made the OST for Block. What a man. Obviously the Gamecube is only gonna do Gamecube graphics. Each console is super different. But I do think the Gamecube could probably look like Wii games. Which is not saying much. The Wii and the Gamecube look the same to me, I'm not gonna lie. I don't know if it can do Wii U graphics. Because I have no Wii U game in mind right now. I also don't know what PlayStation graphics look like. The PlayStation games I've played is San Andreas. Which looks like fucking ass. It looks like an N64 game. I'm playing right now Kingdom Hearts 1.5. The Gamecube can definitely do that. I just think that's not a PS3 game. I've played Hitman. Hitman is gonna be difficult for the Gamecube I think. 4500 lines? We're getting there. We're getting there. It sounds like the Dr. Robotnik song, wait. No, it's the Dr. Robotnik section of the intro of The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. Do you know what I mean? Gamers! Who you calling game? What are we doing today? Programming the bomb. The music's... No, the baby. Okay, cool. I didn't say I'm programming a bomb. Give me a time everyone makes that name. Sorry. Shouldn't be doing that. Okay. Wait, this is way too much. I'm not out here fixing emulators, emulators better fix themselves. So if it doesn't work with an emulator, that's not my fault. And you had 8% of speed? That's fucking hilarious. So it's even worse on your own ROM-MAC compared to mine. Wow. I guess it's just the graphic plugin that's so expensive to run. But I mean that shouldn't be an issue. Okay, just look at me. When I'm here, I don't have a very strong PC. I have 1600% speed. I think the emulator you're using is just trying to emulate lag and it's doing so very poorly. Do they have like Counter-Factor 7 on? I just saw this one. Oh, he moved. Oh. He moved but his position isn't updating. Interesting. That makes sense. Okay, that's kind of what we want. Will it be savoury? Then for a single piece of hardware can I still design for N64 plus 12 emulators? True. Yeah, that's also not quite what I want. No, leave me alone! Ah, I'm making N64 games. Alright, and now you can enter the level. The question is, am I safe? Can I go there? What happens now? Okay. Small issue here. How many progress of Mars Expansion can be done? That game is actually super close to being done. I can show it to you real quick. The thing about this one though is I work on it very little. I work very little on this. But if you look at it, all the levels are done. There are graphical errors right now in this emulator but that's fine. So we have all of Spiral Mountain and stuff. And I think there's a debug mob at the beginning here. We have all the levels in-game and we have all 10 stars finished in every level. And right now we're working on importing all the little enemies. There's some debug text here. Yeah, I don't think I've ever showcased this but we have all the little enemies in here. Like this guy. He's a bit stupid, he doesn't see me right now. Okay, I'm not sure why these are all just running into walls. It wasn't like this the last time I saw them. We got... I mean you can clearly hear the Jinzos. This bat here isn't positioned correctly yet but we programmed this last Sunday. That's why the debug mob was here. Leave me alone! His name is Nibley. Where's the world exit? Over there. Does it use the RTY engine? Not yet but I think it really needs to. Otherwise this is going to be a disappointing release. Personally, I cannot deal with Mario 64's physics anymore. So if someone released a ROM mech that's not based on RTY, I just wouldn't play it. And I don't want to release a ROM mech I wouldn't play myself, basically. But yeah, you can see, basically everything's done. What other levels are there? I actually don't even know how to navigate Banjo-Kazooie's overworld. I guess we can go to Frizzzy Z-Peaks. But this ROM I guess been... We only work on this like every Sunday. And it's not even every Sunday and it's only for like one and a half hours. I don't even know where Deathbox may do it, it might just crash. I haven't set those yet. But yeah, I think 120 stars are finished. And we want to do 140 stars. RTYI Engine is going to be open source. Will we finish RTYI first? I'm not sure yet. See, what I'm going to do is I'm going to finish the RTYI Engine. Hopefully get to 0% Nintendo Code. Then I'm going to remove RTYI from the RTYI Engine. And release just the engine with Mario in a flat field to the public. I'm going to ask people to find improvements on the engine, to point out any remaining Nintendo Code so we can remove that. And have this be properly an open source engine. And then hopefully people can just start developing games with it. Do you see the upper part of Mario Kart 7 Mario model? I'll use the legs from your current model. No, I'm not doing that. Anyway, the wump guard was teleported to the wrong position. So that's a problem. You guessed it, Mario Mix 4 Beast will be quickly ported to the RTYI Engine. That would be very cool, but I don't expect that to be a quick process. Wait! It looks like they fixed the analog 3D. The engineer just wrote me. That's awesome. But I can't show it. Okay, so he is offset way too far forward. That's weird. Oh, fuck, obviously. I only did like 90 divided by 16 degrees. Obviously that wouldn't work. Okay, wrong direction and not far enough forward. There we go. Yeah, the only 3D platformer parts that will be released is gonna be Mario's physics. And obviously if you wanna make a game based off that, you'll have to remove Mario's physics. Okay, it looks like we got this working. Yes, whenever I make a change I need to compile the thing again. I have that sometimes, you need to disable Fast64, close Blender, open Blender again, then open the file and then enable Fast64. It just sometimes gets into this state. It just do be like that sometimes. Alright, all we need now is the blockade. Recompiling takes like 3 or 4 seconds. Unless I make clean, then it takes maybe like 30 seconds. I think we can just use this blocking hitbox object that we already have. Worked awesome. That is just what Fast64 life is like sometimes. I started looking into the homebrew scene a little bit recently. They have some really cool tools, like Tiny3D is such a cool project. And the stuff they have already implemented is awesome. But the one thing they don't seem to have is an audio thread, which is kinda atrocious for N64. You kinda need that thread, otherwise as soon as your game lags even a little bit, the audio becomes really annoying. And you don't want that. Okay, RPGP1 should be fine. Let's check if the blockade works. Why does everyone know this Tim Fallon guy? Everyone's talking about him. Okay, the blockade is a little too big. We just need to move it back 200 coordinates or so. Did Fallon fall for it? No! Evidently, people love this block OSD, even though I've never heard of this block video game. Hello, Adam212? Okay, there we go. Now when I talk to him, he should be like, yep, you got enough stars. He needs a walk animation still. He doesn't go enough forward, and now we can enter the level. Alright, because obviously when he first walks forward, his move angle draw is gonna depend on his angle to Mario. So depending on how you talk to him, the cutscene would look different. So the way we've programmed the cutscene just cannot work. So what we can do instead is we can just guess. How much is this? 45 degrees? Is that his normal angle? It's 30 degrees. So let's just first make him approach around 30 degrees. Which I think is about this. But then... The cutscene will still look different depending on how you talk to him. But it should look similar enough that it doesn't matter. I put this in the wrong arrangement. See, this is what the worst... Oh, shit. I completely fucked that up. Although... This doesn't seem right. But let's try it. How do I complain to the manager here on a video on the analog? Hello, UltraFP64. Did you actually not like the video? I thought I was being very positive towards your work. Just negative towards the shit Analog has been putting out. Because I mean, obviously some of the stuff they're saying is nonsense, right? Right? I'm not crazy. And that kicked in here? Oh, no. Did you hear what I said? I just said hello to you. And asked you what you really thought of the video. Because I thought I was being very positive about your work. And just negative about the advertisement that Analog put out. And I think that's a fair assessment of the situation. It didn't, so you heard nothing. Dang. I think now we've got the cutscene right. He moves forward, and then to the side. Alright. Nice. Nice. He moves maybe a little too sharp at an angle. So let's reduce this to 5800. And then we can bring this flag back. And the Wumpa's programmed. Next task. The Bowser fight. The Wumpa factory and Bowser Tower are both very Bowser-ish. We got that. We still need to make the freefall tower visible, but this is for the final version only. The breakable wall. Can you ask a stupid question? If you redeem it with general points beforehand? Yes. So we want there to be a bombable wall here. I kinda miss a little bit how do we do the 3D mapping without it looking stupid. Also, I kinda don't like that players can't do this. That's gonna kinda break the illusion. Oh well. We'll find a solution for final. What if he does this to let you through a little scare? Spanish? Let's see. Oh. He just falls over backwards? I mean that would be funny, but I kinda don't like it conceptually. So for the bombable wall, I think it should look distinct from the rest of the level here. Although I guess you already get that with the projectiles at the bottom here. Wait, UltraFM65, did you already leave? You didn't answer my question? Dang. I think he's actually mad now. Didn't mean to do that. Maybe about the Skadoshie home asteroid being visible in the distance from the main area and vice versa? I think that on one end would be very cool, but also I mentioned the amount of data needed to be loaded to make the projectiles fall down. I think that on one end would be very cool, but also I mentioned the amount of data needed to be loaded to make the projectiles fall down. I think that on one end would be very cool, but also I mentioned the amount of data needed to be loaded to make the projectiles fall down.

I think that on one end would be very cool, but also I mentioned the amount of data needed to make the projectiles fall down. Sorry, I have to answer some important DMs. Another bumblebee wall? You make it sound like that's a bad thing. Is it? It might be a bad thing. Now I'm insecure about my bumblebee wall. Faustable? No, we can't put the CloudCapper into the overworld, it will just allow you to go high up. No, we can't put the CloudCapper into the overworld, it will just allow you to go high up. And ruin the entire thick effect of this being one part of the overworld. And ruin the entire thick effect of this being one part of the overworld. And ruin the entire thick effect of this being one part of the overworld. And ruin the entire thick effect of this being one part of the overworld. It's problematic. It's problematic. It's problematic. Or are we? I don't know I don't know I don't know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont now I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know I dont know It's just kinda fucked up Maybe it isn't How is this a different material altogether? What the hell? Ok wait So These caves here should probably just be a different texture altogether Just get a clean break And that will make the UV mapping easier too We'll do this And this Now we've got a decent UV map I think Ok that's a lot better Did you hear the Legend of Zelda title screen finally got fully decomped? That is awesome I didn't hear that But that's very cool That is good news to me Ok let's check out how this feels Maybe I should get a wrist brace Luigi being an RTY in any way Luigi currently is an RTY I But I'm not sure exactly how he can fit into the final game just yet We have just been exploring Exploring what? From Galaxies Isle you can now play as Luigi Eh That seems a little disappointing Do you have those mouse wrist rests? They work for non-gaming needs No it's just my left hand which is not the mouse hand That sounds funny a while back But now you're committing the Mario 64 DS sin Where it's like Fuck you! Come back with a different character Which was extremely annoying in Mario 64 DS It's once That's honestly a fair argument Ok interesting The map only works one way right now I think 48 goes to 733 Wait Why is that crashing? Oh no Maybe Namu can tell us something proper I know what the issue is Don't even need to test Nice I'm glad you like Demo 2 I think I have had RTYs that are better than Demo 2 already Like some of the later levels I think people like them a lot more than the demo level I think this is going to be a very popular game That's not the state of emulation That's not an emulation thing I just had a bug in the game because I had a null pointer here that I didn't check against You cannot blame the emulators for everything Sometimes it's the programmers too But it works on the analog 3D Honestly that would be tragic if it worked on the analog 3D If you guys didn't throw a crash on a null pointer that would be a problem Okay so time to make the spawn of a wall I probably want the UV map to stay continuous and just have something on top of it I don't know if it's because I was cooking to make sure it works Ewart wrist cushion Honestly maybe I should look into that Zena is one of those gibble wrist cushions and that one seems pretty chill My wrist just gets fucked up because I slept weird on it And I should not have done that Although no walls visually indicate it, we are going to figure that out right now It's not the mouse, it's the other hand, the one that's on the keyboard that's hurting That lifts yesterday because of it I'm gonna get weak if I can't get it working again soon Yeah so we'd probably do something like this texture here Why isn't rendering like this? Oh man this render engine isn't any better Okay now I could use an analog 3D to render this Okay just hit recreate shader nodes and now it kind of works Did I delete the wall? I did God dammit I must have merged them by distance by accident There we go Okay So a crack texture like this obviously doesn't look very good We want something slightly different Oh that's a cool laugh sound effect in the OST I think the crack over texture just isn't what we need This keeps happening to YouTube viewers Somehow YouTube viewers are always randomly like 4 minutes behind Yesterday someone was 30 minutes behind Crack texture here Quite a few It is only for a star so it can be subtle This is going pretty well Oh it's buffering that makes you go further and further behind That makes a lot of sense Restream is to YouTube and Twitch at the same time So whatever there is on YouTube it also is on Twitch Honestly I'm just gonna go with a random texture My visuals aren't final anyway and I don't want to overthink this for no reason Or again this is a Minecraft texture Biobank somehow slid this into here I'm sure Is that the crack? No, that's so bad I don't even want this here as concept art It just auto-played into this Goodbye Davey It's unbelievable this Tim Fallon guy Think that looks good? It does not look good These are just temporary art This one should also save to the save file and then just be closed forever I think you missed my question What's your question Zemus? I missed your answer because of the delay or whatever I don't know what the question is 100, 693 Yeah so Misty came to death when he asked what I was exploring I do miss a few things I guess I mean do be like that I have to develop a game and talk to you guys at the same time It's a lot you know I don't need the block Mario function anymore I saw the question and I said no there won't be You just missed my answer This game is not about backtracking Actually this is a task flag A full time job now? No I have a full time job as a programmer for a game studio and I'm programming Unreal Engine 5 I can't know that you're not an Indian living in France YouTube is a full minute behind? Oh my god I have this elsewhere The explosion stuff This is dark shit codes I'll do something similar but not so bad I'll do something similar but not so bad I'll do something similar but not so bad I'll do something similar but not so bad I'll do something similar but not so bad I'll do something similar but not so bad I'll do something similar but not so bad I'll do something similar but not so bad Is that why YouTube streaming is unpopular? Because of the large delay? That's crazy and true It's like minus the X right? Does it matter? It matters, it doesn't matter I think I've decided it doesn't matter that the X's are inverted Oh wait, I have it twisted like this 37 units This might cause a slight visual gap to appear It is a low latency mode? Yeah I use default settings because I use Restream to start my stream So I don't set the settings every time Personally I prefer YouTube over Twitch because Twitch has so many ads 400 sideways and then forwards to 200 You lose a legion before Twitch Turbo? I see That feels rotated wrong It breaks though Why is it rotated? Do I have to do minus 37? I think I do, obviously I do And I should print these values once, just to get a good idea Hello Jumpman Matthew, welcome to the stream. Today I feel like I'm in such a good working mood. Oh, oh no. We're out of model IDs. Okay, how long is the game when it comes out? I don't know. We'll find out. How much stuff do I have to do? Mostly the overworld and some level remarks. Otherwise, what does that mean? You can have 255 different models by default in the Mark 64 engine. I have not expanded on that. It still exploded. How come? Okay, this is weird. Something's very wrong with the models right now. But that's fine. Oh wait. What is wrong with me? How the fuck did I fuck that up? Added fallouts to Yu-Gi-Oh? Inward. I don't like fallouts. But I guess Yu-Gi-Oh was in a dire state anyway. Whoa, that back still exists? Wait. How is this not working right now? How is this not working right now? Backwaist distance. Oh, I made the forward distance 20 instead of 200. They need chase carts instead? I don't know what that means. But Yu-Gi-Oh is... Dude, Yu-Gi-Oh is so fucked up, that when you try to sell your carts, people are asking you whether you have old carts or new carts, because no one wants the new carts. Okay, that is working. We just need to actually make the Bob-Omb also explode here. What happens if you throw Bob-Omb into the wall? It doesn't bounce, does it? Okay, so we can actually just go with the explosion then. Like so. I'm a bit worried that its collision distance is too small. So... I'm gonna use this flag here. I'm gonna use this flag here. It's gonna be entirely sought after carts and new sets. Oh, they have those, right? No, Yu-Gi-Oh is all about just making more and more broken carts each set. That's the whole point of the game right now. So you spend more money. Chase Kites is the issue, if anything. Their power level just kept exploding, and then it just kept making it so that the way to win is to make a deck out of carts that all have the same name. It went downhills once Elemental Heroes were introduced. It ruined deck building and creativity. For me, anyway. Okay, it no longer works at all. I guess it doesn't spawn an explosion. I think they removed the explosion spawning from Bob-Ombs. This music's kinda awful. Anyone have a better OST suggestion than this? Yeah, we only spawn explosion VFX. We don't spawn a real explosion anymore. Okay. We have a better- We can do something better. We'll make a helper function for this. We'll do this. And do this. And do this. Let's see if that works. No. Give me something more fun. Today I'm feeling picky. Nice! Not nice. Okay, it looks like... A forward and sideways mixed up. It looks like forward also has a sideways factor. It looks like forward and sideways are mixed up, actually. How did I fuck that up? Oh, fucking obviously. Okay. This should finally be it. G-Shark's Christmas album revamp? Nice, that's good. Unless... Okay, nice. This feels good to me. Oh, right. The model ID thing. We need to fix the model IDs. Oh, they use 0x75 or some shit like that? Oh, damn. Linux Hashtag I think that finishes part VII of the overworld. I see the team nowadays is still just you and Bayo. Badub also helps, and then I'll make some animations. Killer's music? Wait... There's an even worse song that I know that sometimes comes on. Nevermind, I can't find it. How sad. This song is beautifully awful. I love awful music. I don't know why. Are you using C? I can't believe there's a lot of Linux games on SNES. That sounds very real. Anyway, next is a forest clearing. I just realized the significance that we just finished the whole part. Now there's just part IX here. Part X. Part XI. Part XII. Part XIII. And then here in the sky part XIV and XV. But those are going to be very easy to program. So that means now we're on to part XIII. And now part IX. Let me just find an easy way to enter this in the future. Because there's no course entries here. Yeah, it really puts it into perspective, right? We were just working on this part. Like, oh my god, what have we already finished? Just look at the huge part we already finished. This, this, this, this, this, this. There's only this small piece missing. I streamed twice in the last two days. Anyway, let's try to enter part IX. What's the engine? Mario 64? Mario 64. Mario 64. Mario 64. Mario 64. Mario 64. Mario 64. Crossed with RTYI. The engine is mostly just my own programming at this point. I mean, obviously the Hound Engine is still very much Mario 64, just with some tweaks. I mean, with a lot of tweaks. The graphic engine is F3DX3, which is branched off F3DX2, which is like a microcontinent endermate. So it's still close to that in terms of that. And then, like, the graphic engine is basically all custom at this point, I would say. Like the Matrix and stuff engine. Yeah, this is not like a known game engine. This is all, like, just made up. Right, so this would be part IX, which is... This is where some Yoshis live, and where they build a flying ship to go fight Bowser in the sky. So, I guess the way we would end on this by leaving, of course, would be to leave the Bowser 2 level. Let's see if the Bowser 2 level is even entered. Let's see if the Bowser 2 level is even enterable. Missing warp. What was that? This kinda works. What? That's depressing. And... I'm surprised there is a level here. Anyway, we really should figure out why the Bowser 2 level is crashing, otherwise it's going to take a while to get here. So let's see if we can fix the crash there real quick. And... And... And... And... And... And... And... And... And... And... And... Hello, Total Commando. The new Blue Eyes is kinda a myth. They keep making new Blue Eyes. Yu-Gi-Oh can never move on. It's all just nostalgia bait. It's all just nostalgia bait. It's so cringe. I would be so ashamed to work at Konami. Grand Pendulum slop? I don't even know if that's the issue, really. Is base engine... I don't know what you're talking about. See, it's not an engine. Having a hard time connecting 3D graphics in C? I mean, if you know how to render a pixel, then you can render a texture. And if you know how to render a texture, then you can render a triangle with a texture map on top of it. If you know how to render a triangle with a texture map on top of it. You can render a triangle with a texture map on top of it. If you know how to render a triangle, you know how to render a mesh. If you know how to render a mesh, then you know how to render an animated skeleton. So what's the issue? Just figure out how to draw a pixel. I don't think ublogorigin works on Twitch. It's directly in the video player. So eepy. Have you guys ever seen videos where a woman will eat a food and she eats it like this? Why do they do that? I saw one yesterday and it's pissing me off. Why do they cover their mouth? Same thing for YouTube. Oh, I see. Area 2 has all the insides at once. That's how this worked. And Area 1 has a warp somewhere that is missing. I'm only updating Blender when I have to, because updating software is very scary and it's usually a bad idea. Another stupid server online just to annoy you? That's actually so real. Getting the right Python script here. One second. Oh, this might be having to do with the shit we spawned in. Yeah, there's a lot of rage bait online. Wait, what the hell? That's how it works? Why is there so many warps here? No wonder there's a missing warp. What are all these for? I feel like there was a reason here. Was it to store progress? Against the warp 1-3 is useless. But isn't this warp destinations only? I'm actually not sure. That's right. Okay, nice. I know there's issues with the level right now. Don't worry about those. Okay, nice. We can set the exit warp then. Okay, fellas, I need an OST. I need something. Listen to this. I love this song. We are number one. God bless me. YouTube had a thing at one point where ad blockers would just crash. That isn't true. But I think that was an experiment to see if they could get away with it. That they then said was a bug. I don't know. What is this dark music? What? You don't like it? It's Gary Washington. Okay, fine. I guess our only common denominator is video game music. Let's just listen to Mario Sunshine. I don't want to bother you guys with my music taste. There, we can all agree on Mario Sunshine, right? Your dad is a rapper? No joke? Nice. Wow. I mean, everyone can be not a very popular rapper. It doesn't mean anything, right? You can just start doing it. Okay, these changes look fine. Looks fine to me. That was troll music. It's fine. Don't worry. I can take it. I'm gonna cry later by myself. Okay, there are some visual bugs that just appear from the export. I should not have... Okay, I see. Goddammit. I should not have exported this. You know what? I can just undo that. Fuck it. But with this, it's safe. Let's cut all these changes. And then we do this. And now we should have our warp the way we want. Okay. Okay, I haven't exported the castle grounds yet. So over here, we want the Yoshis to be farming stuff. I was thinking there would be a watermelon field here. I'm kinda not sure if I like the size of this overworld anymore. So... Man, so many watermelons are going to be expensive to render. I think that's my main issue. But the issue is also that we want the final boss fight to be here at the end. This will transform into an evil version of the level. Still missing warp. How? Did I just... I just forgot to add them. I literally just forgot to add them. Okay. Yeah, so the idea would be that the overworld keeps transforming as you play through. And then the final boss fight being in the overworld is very fitting. I have to think of it. In the last few courses, we haven't really done anything that changes the overworld, have we? Quest 6, there's nothing. 7 and 8, there's also nothing. Quest 5, there's a lot of overworld changes. Maybe there should be characters from these courses here that, like, appear in the overworld. I don't know. Maybe there should be characters from these courses here that, like, appear in the overworld. Well, I guess the Dude Koopa changes his text. The crab critters appear eventually. But Dino Domain, there's no correlation to the overworld. Same with the Bowser level here. I guess with the Bowser level, though, it doesn't make any sense. That is not Russian. That's German. And I'm not turning it back on. It's gone now. Hello, Tessa. I'm sure I could, but I'm not going to. I'm sure I could, but I'm not going to. This is kinda stinky that... You don't really see that there's something to go up there. You just see that you can't go here. So even if you do later find Super Happy Tree Seedling, you're probably not going to think to go here. But maybe that's fine? Given that there's another way around, and that other way is just as bad as this way around. And that's just as bad as this way around. I guess people wouldn't realize to go here either. That's something to investigate. Is there a release candidate planned for this game once it exits? What does that mean? Obviously we're going to put together a release candidate to release the game. Are you asking whether I'm planning to release the game at all? Because the answer is yes. I think on real N64 the load times are faster. Emulators try to emulate the lag a little bit, and they're very accurate in it. So I've had the experience that on real N64 the load times were a lot faster. No, that's the... You just per se have to levitate. Yeah, I'm glad you're enjoying the videos. I was thinking of making a video just talking about my favorite combiners. My favorite materials you can make on the N64. I hope that would be interesting. I think we should shorten this overworld in total if we can. Like this little piece we should just remove. Just make it a little less annoying to traverse. I think we fell a little bit into a trap making the overworld too big on our first draft. Which is, I guess, a fine issue to have. I don't know what I'm doing here. Jamin Semmela? Who's that? I already have a musician, Badoop. And I wasn't planning on replacing him. I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not sure what I'm doing here. I don't know what I'm doing here. You know, I think, if like You know, I think, if like is like grand Kirkhope offers to do a song. I would maybe still say like Nah, sorry. But maybe I would say yes just to have the name in there. But I'm not sure. I would internally be like I kinda don't want that. But externally I'd be like Yay, fame. You could just do one. Yeah, that's probably what I would do. Yeah. Well, I guess the answer is that Doom didn't need 8 megabytes of memory. It's the only explanation. Yeah, we should think of a way to make it more obvious that you can move forward here. Because this is actually really bad. The fact that you can't see that there is a way forward. Well, what happened here is that the super happy tree seedlings would grow. And you could climb up. And then you could move forward. Wooden structure. No, it can't be something you can climb. Make it obvious it's a path. Yeah, actually. Arrow sign, that's so lazy. I was thinking like a slope you can't climb. But even a slope you can't climb, I'm sure you can just climb it if you do some jank stuff. So that's a problem. Oh well, it would maybe be enough if we could get this to look more climbable. Oh yes, just that yellow paint. Sir, this is not a Star Revenge development stream. I mean, we can try the concept of just a slope for a second. See if this has a like to stand on. Let's see. Let's see, why is that hanging down? Well, the thing is you can't climb it until you have made sufficient progress in the game. Okay. To put a sign there or something, I would suggest putting a coloured coin there. Then anytime in the future when you have this issue, you can just check the same type of coin and move on. Oh, yellow paint you mean. Yeah, no, we're not putting a sign anywhere. We'll figure out something better than that. I'm sure. I mean, the slope makes you intrigued to be like, hmm, what's up there? The only worry I have is that you can't climb it after all. You know what I mean? Most annoying skip in video game history, but it's theoretically possible. You guys have no idea how difficult that was. What I just did was like a lot of very, very precise inputs. Make it honestly, you might just be a genius. Yeah. Let's try how this goes. But an orbital laser that's striking down Mario if he goes up without a good amount of progress. Oh, I see. There's a skip like that in Mario Sunshine that is being acknowledged by a Toad. That is very funny. I didn't think Nintendo would do that. I know one other video game that acknowledges if you skip. And this game calls you the hot R for skipping. It's like, what the fuck? Why did you put that there? Yeah. Yep, now you can't skip anymore. Mudslide was the right idea. That's actually awesome. Yeah. Mudslide. I always manage to do it anyway. I have my doubts. Okay. But then these walls don't need to go that high anymore, which is good. We like to be able to reduce the size of our walls a little bit. I'm not sure if that's a good idea. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. So, every time I find a crazy move that needs to be redone in systems. Now, if you'll find a movement exploit that I didn't think of to get up here, then they may skip this level. It's too obvious now. The mystery is a bit more intriguing. It should be like... Nah, this is mysterious enough. Nah, that's out of sight. You can't see shit here. I think this is fine. Hmm. You know, the most surprising part of actually working on video games in a professional environment is how little of it is let's reasonably, let's logically think about what we should do and how players may interact with it and how much of it is let's just throw shit and get feedback and then improve it. Like, you actually don't need any skill to develop a game. You just need to test. When you release to playtest as first or YOLO, I'm doing a lot of playtesting. Playtesting is by far the most important part of the game development process. And I don't just mean, like, luck testing. I mean, like, design testing. We now have mud. Let's check the vibes. In case your allergies freak you out. Let's check the vibes. In case your allergies freak you out. I don't know much Taylor Swift. But I'm not a rapper. I use monotiles a few times. Probably have, like, four volatile variables in my whole source base, Okay. ASM volatile doesn't count. One, two, three... I cast this one to volatile, I don't know if that counts. Three variables, truly volatile, so the cycles thing, I don't use it. Four... Nope, I can't use it. Four... Yep, exactly four. I love pop music and microplastics and our support team. And I will go vote in the next election. Apologies, the brainworm running in. Yeah, let's see if we can skip this in any way. That's not the way to skip it, for sure. What the fuck? Is this not... Wait, that's not a walking angle? Oh, it looks so close to being skippable. Yippee! Would getting up even help? If you can get up, you can skip it. It's skippable. No way. Is the world also tiny but corrupt? I honestly might just do this. Just to completely tell the player like, yeah, you're not skipping here. I like the idea of waterfalls, but we should have them elsewhere. There's nowhere for the water to drain. They're more than just a tiny bit crooked. You can BLJ here on the crooked walls now. If you wanna BLJ, your BLJ spot's already right here. That is not the issue. I don't know if you can actually see upslides up here now. We should try that too. I think I need to step away from my computer because my wrists are starting to hurt too much. That sucks. Let's test this one more time. BLJ and RTYI is actually very different. I know on Mario 64 you could just see upslides up here. In RTYI, I don't actually know if that works. We'll have to test it. I think you can actually start sliding in C up in RTYI. Also, the scale of this level... I need to think about this again. The scale of this is fine. There will be Yoshi houses here, there will be a bar. That seems all good to me. The scale of this... I think I can accept it. And then here, the watermelon field. Where the boss fight area is going to be later. Honestly, I think that's fine too. I'm not gaining any speed. Maybe it doesn't just work. Actually, yeah. Maybe you can't BLJ on ceilings anymore. I think ceiling BLJ might be gone. So, how else could we skip up here? I don't know. Wait, that works? That's lame. I'm gonna disable that. Yeah, I'm gonna put that on my bugs list actually. Bugs. I don't like that. Yup, anyway. Next up, make watermelons. Program this part, make the Yoshi houses here. I'm done for today. I will see you guys in the next stream, which might just be tomorrow if you get lucky. I might just stream tomorrow. So, until then. Bye bye!
