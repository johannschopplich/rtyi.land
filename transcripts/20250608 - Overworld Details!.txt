Hello. I hope YouTube chat works again today. I'm typing a test message in here because it didn't work last stream. Hello Waffle. YouTube chat works again. Let's go. Hello Mimowski. Wrong audio output. Hello Momfe. Yo Whoohoo. Hello Jamezow. American World OST. I don't think it's out yet is it? Is it? Let's see. There's only Rainbow Road out. There's a guy uploading all of them at the moment. All right, let's check this out then.  Wow. All right, I just wanted to make sure the stage works. Career 7 is now fully functional again. I just need to add the five Yoshi coins. You might notice that my Windows looks a little different today. Yep, it is Windows 11. Look at this, I got 80 Gigabytes again. That is so nice. My Windows 10 was completely messed up. Does the stream focus on a specific project? Yeah, it's all on Return to Yoshi's Island. Which is one huge game I'm making. My god, the ghost house in Cooper Carnival is so good. It is so fun. Yeah, when they stop doing security updates, you will have to upgrade. Retro Arcade I know. FT Mario Bros Arcade version. Is there a rework? No, this was just me updating everything in Course 7, sounds and making sure everything works. And I have now brought it back to full functionality. Hey, isn't that cool? I also fixed Mario's head, finally. This new model. What is going on? Why is my game not starting? It might just be an N64 thing. We all know how the N64 likes to be. Did you know how to code Mario Bros Arcade on game? I did. Only 300 megabytes of disk space left. I was in that situation before I updated to Windows 11. The update to Windows 11 means that a lot of the software I use has to change. So instead of Sony Vegas, I now use DaVinci Resolve. And I'm now on Blender 4.2 with the official 4.2 hotkeys. So I don't think this level fully works on N64, but let's see. 30 fucking fps. 24. But back to solid 30. And there's an issue here. God damn it. DaVinci. Do we have some light and ambient colors in this game? Can I use them in an actor? No. But if you can tell me what you want to use them for, I can maybe tell you how to do something similar to that. Yeah, you can't use the light color in Fast64. It won't work. Bro, how fucking long does it take to open my overworld level? What the hell? I didn't plan for now. It's just a bright light from underneath. Can you make a two cycle and set combined color alpha in cycle one to something like one multiplied by shade plus shade alpha. And then in cycle two, you set combined color alpha to C and combined color to A. And then just make it brighter like that. You don't mean the combiner. So you need it to be the light. You can't just be the color output. You should try this at some point. Mipmapping. What's mipmapping for? Bro, how does it take this fucking long to load my blender file? Perm rotates on the y-axis. If it's for like a special effect, I can add an actual light coming from underneath instead of doing the ambient thing biopack. I would just have to know of that beforehand. Because I can just add a light and 3D space to it. It's a fork of blender. What the hell? I don't want to use a different blender version. Bro, load the level. What is going on? I have never had this. I updated to Windows 11 recently, by the way, two days ago. So this might be a Windows 11 thing. I also have had two blue screens since I updated. What the fuck? So what's wrong with 4.2? Okay, but Lila, if we branch off blender now, we're not going to get new blender features. We're going to lose like 10,000 people contributing to the whole modeling program. Keeps lagging and crashing. I haven't had any crashes yet, or more like the old version. It's not a fucking fork. We said newer blender is really just awful, which is why we have this. It's a fork of blender. Okay, when you say instead of blender we have this, it sounds like, you know, blender has been replaced. Well, we're kind of implying it. At least that's how I read that message. So the new hotkeys are really rough to get used to for me. I will be pretty slow today. Although it looks like my slowness won't even come into play, considering how fucking slow blender is right now. I don't want a copy of your blender now. I can download any blender version I want off the internet. I just figured it would be a good time to update blender. Hello, Sarah. Also, I have a completely custom version of project 64 now. This is still in development. But it already has some neat improvements. The most important one is that the audio actually works. Yes, this all runs on real hardware. That's the whole point. I might also add Luigi to the game soon. Pixelpalabra made a really nice Rty Luigi. I don't know if you saw that Biobak. He made it in the same style as your Mario model. I guess you can't really see it that well here. But it looks pretty nice from what I've seen. It will be straight Luigi. I'm sorry to disappoint. Hate to let you down on June, but it is what it is. So, so, then what is going on? Unselect the fucking stuff. Thank you. Guys, I have to admit something. So far, I don't feel very motivated to play Mario Kart World at all. Not that it looks bad, it just looks uninteresting. You see the common RNGC that just says the new Mario model is gross? No, I did not. I'm just going to have to use this area. There's like 16 different coloring areas. So there is going to be a lot of coloring. That's what all the tunnels are for. The new Mario looks gimmicky. Oh, Mario Kart World looks gimmicky. No, I don't think it looks bad at all. I just am not interested in it. This is loud as fuck. I'm skipping this one, bro. Calm down. Okay, never mind. We have to just... I scare you. I'm sorry, Leela. I didn't mean to scare you in June. I will be back to scare you in July. Oh, I gotta UV map this, too. Yeah, I noticed that, too. I put out a skit today where I said, like, you guys noticed that, you know, the companies didn't turn gay this June? Like, they no longer think that supporting gay is profitable. So, can you say this, man? I wonder what do you think about making cloud camps into winged clouds? Oh, the cloud. Oh, yeah, that I kind of like it, yeah. I mean, orgasm isn't cringe, but good. No, no, no, no, no. It's always been lip service. Okay, it's kind of like how... How do I say this in a way that's not edgy? You know how people, like, they read the Bible and they reinterpret it to always align with the current day morals, right? So, when there's something they don't like, it's like, oh, yeah, this was back then, like, it was different times. Of course, that part doesn't count. Similar thing is going on with companies, but instead of that, they, like, project back to you what they think society already believes. They're, like, we align with what society aligns with. So, in a way, it's not useful at all. It's completely meaningless. It just tells you what they think you already think. By definition, like, what the politics of company puts out, it's just preaching to the core. That is what they're attempting to do. It is a sign, yes, yes, yes, absolutely. Right, from what they preach, you can deduce what they think the core is. You know what I mean? Human McDonald's doesn't care about gay rights. Ronald McDonald doesn't care about gay rights. That's who's putting out the exceeds from McDonald's, right? It is Ronald McDonald. Oh, who is it? Who's putting out the exceeds from McDonald's? Who's the official guy doing it? John McDonald? Or is it maybe a fucking entity with no feelings? Only money? It's... So it's a monotonous thing and you're also normalizing it? Yeah, but it's already normalized. Otherwise they wouldn't be supporting it. You know, it's circular. It's another idea. When you make a safe state, Yoshi looks at you like this. Imagine you're safe state in the overworld and every Yoshi turns around to look at you like, bro, are you serious? Very funny. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  What are you doing? I am doing the 3D modeling. Slow blender there, dude. Holy shit. Maybe it's because I'm streaming that blender slowed down so much. Are you making a collision map? No. Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind? Do you guys remember that YouTube video? Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind? The fucking pranksters. There's nothing that wrong with 4.2. Fucking finish the render and I might use it. What's wrong with 4.2, guys? Holy fuck, that was a big gulp. I don't have lag issues except when I'm streaming. And I think that's just because it's combined with so many shaders. It's just bad. Okay. It's just bad. What's the hotkey for marking a scene? Okay. They moved it to fucking F3, that menu. I mean, I def- What did I do? Okay. I definitely see though that getting used to a new software version like this is painful as hell. Like, oh my god. It is so annoying. Okay. You can resign any shortcut you want. I know, but I wanna, you know, just make use of the default controls. Because surely there is a reason they are the default. I already made a bunch of non-default defines. These default controls are an ass. They are a little weird. Remapped half of them? Holy shit.  Why does this not unwrap perfectly? Oh. There's a hole here. That's why. Is this fucking Ricoh Harbor? They have Ricoh Harbor in it. That is kinda cool. What am I being pinged for? Oh! Pixel Polaro has a better showcase. Ooh! Yes! This is RTY Luigi. Look at them. He does really look like the Luigi version of Mario. Like, that's exactly how you would imagine him to look like. I like him. Just showcasing the Luigi. I'm probably importing the Luigi this week. Maybe tomorrow I can start cleaning out some unused files in the RTY folders. And it will open up enough memory for Luigi to fit into RAM. Ooh, this one is completely pitch and hold in. We don't want that. There we go. Okay. Luigi in new Mario 64 game along Arcade 2D. Now let's press fucking L to select Blink. That's all the way across the keyboard. Okay, I did that on the previous Blender version too. I am guilty of wanting to do that. Okay. You know what? This should be a nice brown texture. Fuck it. We're making a new one. Let's check to see if I have any Ibex. I don't know. Do I have Ibex, guys? I didn't sleep enough, I think. But I don't see Ibex on camera, so maybe I'm just immune. Maybe I'm just built better than Lila. Quite the opposite, so I have pretty bad Ibex. Okay. As in you don't have Ibex? Let's fucking go. I got no Ibex. Dude, I might get a sponsorship with Mantasleep. They sent me a sleep mask. It's actually great. And fuck, I just made advertisement for them for free. But that would be cool. Then the eepy sleepy little princess Lila can go to take her beddy-boos. Put the sleep mask. Hello, daddy. How are you? Steam. 8 hours just to get Ibex. Do I smite? What does it mean, do you smite? Like, are you sitting on a cloud right now with a Thunderbolt? What do you mean? Oh, you're thinking about banning a bot. I have no idea. I missed the message. I didn't see a bot message. Hello, decisive dolphin. I've been back at it for a while. It is crazy how I feel like I can speak and think so much clearer when I don't take pre-workout in the morning. Maybe pre-workout has been making me stupid and I shouldn't take it anymore. Okay. Someone gave me a ping where I was the best decision of your life? How come? What's the big difference? I never actually thought much about it. I kinda just love how stimulants feel, I guess. Which is not a good reason to take something. It is a very bad reason, in fact. What the hell is going on? There we go. Hmm. But yeah, I've never bought pre-workout ones, but the one I'm using right now was gifted to me. So I figured I might as well just use it up. But if it actually messes with my mental clarity, then of course I'm not gonna. I see. That makes sense, though. Like, what you're describing right now, I'm kind of feeling the same way right now.  So maybe you're not just being a hypochondriac. I actually find it very, very easy to quit things like that. Like, I can go from taking caffeine every day to just not taking caffeine. With no adverse effects. How is this a quad in the UV map? What the hell? Oh. Oh, Charles. Holy shit, Luigi. You saw Luigi somewhere? I'm sure by now you guys all know Kindness Luigi. We don't even need to talk about him anymore.  1 and then 3, 9. Early in the video. Oh! Right, you can see old stuff because you're on YouTube. It's awkward. I feel like the Splendor version exports faster. It's kind of nice. I mean, maybe it would be nice if Fitch let you do it. But if you're able to do it, at least you shouldn't be able to also type in chat. It's funny you mentioned that, DallyDust, because I did that with Ares. I made Ares look like Internet Explorer to piss people off. Or, well, not to piss people off, but to fuck with people. And it worked great. People were like, why are you using Internet Explorer all the time? Okay. Well, that explains why there was a quad here. This is how you write any code for a subject or you write it all on your own. So now that I've done that and based on the research, it has written me some cool stuff. Check GPT is not really helpful for coding for stuff like this. Check GPT is the only use case I see for it is just like a Google substitute. Because it is marginally better than using Google. But usually that's like knowledge checks like, you know, if I didn't know a blender hotkey, I could just ask it what the hotkey is and I'd have a 50% chance that it would tell me the right hotkey and a 50% chance that it just tells me some bullshit that's not true. Do you like training in the morning? I cannot train like almost the entire day because I take long rests between sets. So I start in the morning and I finish in the evening. I think I'm not gonna bother with making this seamless just yet. There's still a visible calamus machine between the ground wall and the trees. Oh, these trees, don't worry about that. These trees are definitely going to change later on, so we shouldn't be worrying about that. And there's going to be more stuff in front of the trees to make this whole thing look more 3D. I kinda hate this song. Wow, this song sucks. Shut up! Can't be the only one, right? Why are there so many squads? So we can have multiple textures on them, which gives us a fake texture resolution that's way higher than what the N64 would normally be able to do. This needs to be mushrooms. I don't know.  We're getting music? No, this is Mario Kart World OSD. Because someone in chat asked me to listen to it. Am I the only one here who thinks that automatic lawnmowers are cool as fuck? Why aren't we talking, like as a society, talking more about automatic lawnmowers? I feel like we completely underestimate how cool they are. That's such a 40-year-old person's thought. What?! Right, I forgot you guys don't live in houses. You live in cramped little boxes with your parents. How are you doing? Why do you need to know that? Who are you? Who sent you? Couldn't handle the hills on your lawn? If they can handle the hills on my lawn, then they will be able to handle them on yours. My lawn is almost like you could go ski jumping there. What is the current soundtrack? It's called De De De De De from Mario Kart World. Excuse us, Mr. Millionaire. I'm not a millionaire! Mowing your lawn is cock mentality, which is why you have an automatic lawn. Actually no, it's Sisyphus mentality. The one I have was the cheapest one I could find, which is around 600 US dollars. Yes, exactly, Bjorn. That's how it works. Does Otomo detect baby bunny nests? No, but he would likely ram into them and then be like, oh, there's a blockade here, let me turn around. 600 is the cheapest, that's crazy. Okay, but think about this. How much time do you spend mowing your lawn if you don't have an Otomo? Maybe you do it every two weeks for two hours? You do this for an entire summer, what, six months? That's two hours multiplied by six times you have to do it, 12 hours. This is like, what do you make, $20 an hour? Let's say you work minimum wage, $15 an hour. That's already $300, and you save the cost of buying a different lawn mower. So really, after just like one or two years, it's already worth it. You should mow your lawn like eight times a year? Yes, every two weeks for three months in summer. I only calculated six times just now. Look, I'm just saying, man. 600 bucks for an automatic lawnmower is only a bad deal if your time is almost worthless. What do you mean I'm doing it again? You're just being rational. Case would be good at Bell outro? Probably. This is what normal everyday people with houses do in summer. Okay, if normal everyday people with houses in summer jumped off bridges, would you jump off a bridge?  I trapped you with the oldest trick in the book, dude. Case, actually, that's the appeal to killing yourself fallacy. That's not comparable. Yeah, all I hear is the whining of like the loser of the argument, you know. It is comparable. Thank you, ArcMath. Do you have HF radio? Nope. I need a mushroomy floor. Let's see if there's anything on model resource. Are you trying to kill yourself with a lawnmower? No. You have to think about this. Okay, how many hours do you have in your life? Think about it. Let's say 75 years on average. Multiply it by 365 days, multiply it by 24 hours. That's this many hours. Now, how much do you have to mow the lawn? You have to mow the lawn for the next 50 years. Multiply it by, we said like 8 times a year. Multiply it by 2 hours. That's 800 hours for the rest of your life. Now, if you do this, divided by this. Yeah, maybe you're not killing yourself, but... You are spending 0.12% of the rest of your life on mowing the lawn. You are 0.12% killing yourself by mowing the lawn instead of getting an automower. And I didn't even factor in sleeping. Actually, you're doing way more than that. And working too. Yeah, you actually just have to factor in your free time. You're probably like 0.8% killing yourself by not buying an automower. What about taking showers then? Oh, don't even get me started. You play League of Legends, your time is already worthless. Valid. ... I want something with mushrooms on the floor. This is kind of nice. Can you see me trying for an automatic lawnmower sponsor? Dude, I need Hilske Varner to sponsor me. I actually sent them an email like 3 days ago. Asking them for the source code to their fucking software so I can fix the lawnmower. I was like, guys, please let me program the lawnmower. Your program sucks. My lawnmower keeps getting stuck. I want to program it myself, please. But unfortunately they wouldn't let me. They were like, if you need a software update, please go to your local Hilske Varner provider. And they will charge you $50 to run a program for 2 minutes. Gee, thanks. I can drive for 2 hours so I can let someone else run a program on my lawnmower for 2 minutes. And then give them $50 instead of doing it in the comfort of my own home. Honestly, yes. We need a lawnmower home, Bruce. Imagine if I could play Doom on my lawnmower. I wouldn't do it, but imagine if I could. What do you mean edit your images using AI? What is this Windows 11? I don't... No! I don't want this. Let my lawnmower's entire source code to optimize it, then use the video to pass the mower as a company expense. Honestly, that would be peak. Is there not like a forest with little mushroomy textures on the floor? What if we just google mushroom? Wait, isn't there a Mario RPG 3D remake? Mushroom bridge. Hmm. You can buy a house and pass it up as a company expense if you make a house 2 video about it. I'm sure that's how it works. I'm sure the person that made the TikTok you're referencing right now, which I'm assuming you're referencing in TikTok, has not been arrested for tax evasion yet. Dude, imagine I make a lawnmower program and it's like a super optimized lawnmower, but I also make it check the geo coordinate. And if the lawnmower is not mowing at my house, I just make it mow a penis into your lawn. I could do that. Are you looking for mycelium? Let's see.  Yeah, I'm not looking for this, I think. I'm just looking for a floor with a bunch of mushrooms on it. Oh, I can no longer look at TGA files. This is an issue. I need a new picture editor. Yes, the mower has a GPS. Pot soil. Hmm, this looks pretty awful. Is this like a Minecraft bug that there's supposed to be mushroomy? Hmm. Creta. What about GIMP? Photopia online. Oh. Crazy. I'll have to look into this after the stream. For now, I would like to try and find texture with some mushrooms on it. Mushroom floor texture. It's basically for show bottom browser. I see, I see. Is there not a forest with like a ton of mushrooms on the floor? Like, is this not a normal thing that happens? I need to go into Windows 11. It says it's been sitting on Windows 10 for quite some time, even after Windows 11 release. Well, I knew I was going to have to update soon anyway. And I thought that there was a shot I might have a virus. I'm not sure if I had one. But because of that, I figured, yeah, right now is a good time to do it. Okay. Okay, from the sounds of it, Creta is the one I'm most interested in so far. I don't want Photoshop because of Photoshop's stupid bug with transparency. Hmm. What about Sprite as resource? Resource. Well, I am Windows-bound due to work. So Linux doesn't help. So. Well, you know how people were really scared about Y2K for a long time. Time. I think that if Windows 10 long-term support really gets cancelled and there's no more security updates, we might have a genuine Y2K-esque situation at hand. If you have a Windows XP computer and all you do is connect to the internet, you will get hacked. There is no reason to believe that Windows 10 is not going to get into that state eventually. And because so many machines still run on Windows 10, I think there's a good shot that as soon as the security support stops, all Windows 10 machines just get destroyed. Texture resource, let's try that too. Isn't this just model resource without the 3D models? Hmm. Wait, this song is so Mario Kart Double Dash. It's N64 Mario Stadium. Wait, how am I even gonna edit this texture? I don't have a program to edit the texture with. Fuck. You know what, I'm just going to say fuck it for now. We're just gonna pick a texture that we already have and it's going to be fine. Hopefully. I like the ether grass a lot. Ech. Hello YouTube sucks, welcome to the YouTube stream. Ooh, gave me a 33x33 texture. What is this? Hmm. Honestly, it looks somewhat much for me. Okay. Oh no, I'm in this poopy mode again. Okay, I got out. Alt-P doesn't work anymore. It does not have a button assigned to it. Cool. I probably got lied to, but it is what it is. I should just check the menu to see if there's one. Okay, thank fuck, Alt-J still works. I'm in this poopy mode again. Ctrl-F. Ctrl-F maybe in here. Ctrl-F and then P. Got it. Honestly, it's not that bad. Oops. What happened here?  Why not ask AI to make you a texture? Give me an AI that can make your textures and I will show you why it's a terrible idea. You can pick any you want and I will prove to you it's a terrible idea. It's because it's multiple textures. You can only have one texture per primitive, so there's no other option. So, so, so, this is kind of a cool song. I did it again. So, so,  Damn, I actually thought today would be the day we do Dino, Dino Domain or Divine Dino Domain. Biobak's been teasing me for a while. My architect is a free AI software. Okay. Now what? Wait, how does this not look different at all? What the hell? Oh, because we're so green that it doesn't matter. Huh. Can't even use search engines in a search environment because AI floods the results. Basically, you're required to add them before you run every search. You get good results trying. Okay, you want me to try that? My architect. Get 10 renders for free. Let's try it. I will show you it's a terrible idea. I don't have an input. How am I supposed to use this? It wants an input image. I don't have an input image. I don't have an input image. You just need to be downscaled. How do I use this? Without an input image. I got nothing. Where's the texture generator? Do you have like a link to where I'm supposed to use it? But probably the problems that we're going to get is, of course, resolution too high. Then second, it will not be seamless. Third, it won't be in the right art style. Texture generator? Is there one? Okay, let's try this. 32x32 Seamless Mushroom Texture in a Stylized cartoonish art style No. Okay. Maybe seamless texture of mushrooms growing on a forest floor. That's not a texture. That's just an image. For a material to be applied to a 3D model. What do you mean? This is just an image from above. Oh, I see. Yeah, YouTube would filter out your link. Tell it to do orthographic? Let's do orthographic. A seamless texture of mushrooms growing on a forest floor in an orthographic perspective to be used for a 3D model. Is this good? You know what? It actually looks almost seamless, though. I mean, the top and bottom isn't seamless, but the left and right look like they might be seamless. That's why I said you downscale it. Okay, but downscaling doesn't fix it. It's not... What do you mean? ... Is this what you got? Yeah. ... This is why we have prompt engineers. No, I don't think prompt engineers could have fixed that. ... Hello, E-Man with make-up. Grok, is this real? ... What the fuck was that sound? ... This little piece of dirt here really bothers me. It's gonna be difficult to work with. Can I maybe just take this out and do this? ... ... We can do this. ... The textures we received were not seamless. ... ... ... Hello, X-Links.  I don't think AI texture generation is anywhere near the level where it can actually be used. ... ... ... ... Doesn't mean it will never be there, but like right now it's just too bad. Get a couple of seamless textures. But do any of them look any decent? Because what it gave me was atrocious. And I don't think I did an awful job at prompting it, so... This is a pretty nice texture, isn't it? We gave it a few attempts. You have to type seamless instead of seamess? There's no way I type seamess twice. Come on. I mean, if you want to, you can try it and then send me the texture. Wouldn't that be easier if it was like up to my prompting skills? That's the issue? Yeah, if you have a good one, I wanna see it. Keep in mind I'm looking for a mushroom texture, not pictures of mushrooms. Both times I typed seamless instead of seamless? That's messed up if I did. Can you post a discount link? Sure, sure. Just post it in general or in showcase. Okay. Okay. Man, I'm feeling so tired today. Yeah, this is not a good texture. This is again just images of mushrooms. And there's a piece of toast here. And they are on bricks when we needed grass. There's also way too many. So if I scale this down to 32 by 32, this would just look like noise. And then it also kind of looks like it's the bottom part of the mushrooms and not the top part. But it does kind of look a little like a texture. I will give you that. Like this might actually kind of work as a texture. I don't even see any super obvious seams here. Where would there be seams? I guess this one here would be a bit of a seam. That's not like actually a round shape. Yeah. It's definitely not up to the standards of textures we want in this game though, unfortunately. Okay. How did I learn to do this? I just did it and then I got good. I don't know. I gotta finish the eight Yoshi coins. The five Yoshi coins in the carnival level today. I'm gonna do that after I'm done streaming. And then I'm gonna start deleting stuff to make space for Luigi. You know at the end of Mario Galaxy you can just play as Luigi. What if we just... Eh, maybe not. I don't know. I can't believe I missed the keys using AI section but I wish you had a pretty good chance to design the image at this peak. We only used it to show it doesn't work. We weren't actually going to like, you know, try to make it work. I just don't believe AI is good enough right now to actually use any of it. Plus with anything AI you have to keep in mind there is a huge debuff because people hate it and people are going to hate your game for using AI. So just from that perspective AI is something you wouldn't want to use. There's another one with red mushrooms. This is pictures of mushrooms. You see how this is just like a drawing of a bent mushroom. Also there's like huge seams here. Huge, huge seams. I guess this is the texture. I mean it's a little more fitting but it's still quality-wise pretty, pretty bad unfortunately. Fuck, I need to undo what I just did real quick. Oh fuck. I fucked up completely. Holy. I just killed all the decals I made. Oops. Textures from modifying image sample CDs. So there is a funny thing potentially going on. Someone wants me to make a ROM egg based off the Groots and they're willing to pay good money for it. So there is a good chance that we will speedrun making a Groots major hack at some point. We're probably going to try to make the whole thing within like a month. With 120 stars. And I think it has huge comedy potential. Groots actually, not Groots. I am barely even familiar with them. As you can tell. And for that we definitely need some hastily made textures. Like the Groots from the movie? Yes. But if the guy pays $5000 for it, then I mean, it's a good enough deal. So for that I'm probably just going to pick out like 15 environments. Get like 100 textures ready. And then speedmodel the whole thing. Put some basic platforms in it. And I honestly think it's going to be like a great fun ROM hack. Yeah, if the guy goes through with it, we'll do it Lemon Guy. This area is beautiful. But you see how fast we can model an area like this, right? And it looks good enough. You could do something like this. It would be a passable game. Just put some platforming in there, some stars, you're done. That would be the idea. Just speedrun a major hack. You know how I made Super Mario 64 Madness in like two weeks? Kind of like that would be the idea. I definitely want more little mushrooms all over the floor. We can steal those from Course 1. I agree with you that the floor is too empty, Rick, but we have a plan. Don't worry. Opening this blend file might take a bit. This doesn't blow up the file size, right? I'm giving Zelda the obsessive reign right in the distant future. Maybe. Absolutely no guarantees. It is something I would like to do, but I need big time to do that. Oh, it doesn't blow up the size at all. This one opened way faster. Are you drinking from a pitcher? Yes. Problem? That was my troll face. I hope you enjoyed my troll face. The optimization principles are the same across all the N64 games, because they're running on the same hardware, so it doesn't really matter. What the fuck? Select the things! What are you doing? What would you do if you could lactate? I would not lactate. Okay, the C programming language. That... I'm not sure how to properly express my disgust with that statement. There's nothing wrong with C, but a programming book? What do you mean? Who would read a programming book? What even is the point of that? Cool command in the Mario Kart world? I have not figured out how to BLJ in real life. I'm working on it. I'm off the opinion that programming is not something you learn. Or go to school for. It's something you just do. That was a yummy looking strawberry. It's alright. Has nothing with less visible, it seems. But again, when perfect, it's probably pure luck. I don't think it's possible. But even then, this is still not a great texture. Because you can see how this is just a picture of mushrooms again. Like, this isn't actually a texture. We're looking for something where the mushrooms have a consistent direction they're being looked at from. This here is just them lying down a bunch of mushrooms on the floor and taking a picture of it. It doesn't look real. And it's also way too big. Which means if we scale it down to 32x32 it would end up being way too noisy. Thanks for watching! Programming learning books probably made a lot more sense before C, back when BASIC was the standard and you couldn't google anything. Cause you had to get started somehow. Nowadays still it doesn't matter, you can just get an example program and think you're done learning. Yep, they're very cheap mushrooms. Where the hell is my triangle display? Blenda! Show me the triangles! There we go, 576 triangles, that's not so bad. Look in Discord. This is a better mushroom floor, but this would be very obvious repetition wise. But this is a better example of what we want. The problem with this one is that you would see all the repeats a lot, the mushrooms here are too big. We need the mushrooms to be way smaller and we need them to be like different colors. Blenda voice commands probably already exist. You know, some blind people can 3D model too. Bro, do you think a braille 3D model editor is possible somehow? There has to be something here, right? There has to be a way blind people can 3D model. That has to be such a bizarre experience for them. You don't need to lactate to be good at using C? Yes. Many people would argue that you're better at C if you do not lactate.  Chet and CBT indeed. Sculpting is tactile and screen is not. What if you had a VR headset and the VR said you could feel around and it gave you feedback in your headset. Joycons to be like, oh you're very close to the thing and it rumbled or something. What if you took a real blind person and you made them speedrun Super Mario 64 blind the same way Bubsy does it. Do you think they would have any idea what the fuck is going on? It could work. I feel like it would be impossible for them. Because I think even the way Bubsy does it is that he knows what the 3D layout of a level looks like. And a blind person wouldn't have that. A blind people, yeah sure. Woah, woah, woah, what did I do? That was a weird button. Blind people can play games. But even something like Mario 64? How would they make sense out of that? I know that there's a thing for World of Warcraft to make it so that blind people can play. Makes a lot more sense to me. But Mario 64 man? It's all about 3D space and stuff. What have we here? We invented a device that outputs smell. And then we made it so that different parts of different levels in Mario 64 smell different. And also we made it so that when you get closer to a star it says hot hot hot hot hot. Do you think they could then beat Mario 64? We send a new texture. This is still just a picture of a mushroom here. But it looks a lot closer to what we need. But this is still nonsense this one here. Tree level unplayable? Tree level? Oh, because it smells like garbage. Okay. They're probably not that far away from actually just having smell in video games. Okay. What about these?   Sorry. No.  You can get a box that produces smells. Maybe you just have to recharge it or buy new smell cartridges. You know, like a printer. Yeah, like imagine printing smells.  Imagine if you could print smells. The Japanese version indeed has rumble support. Okay. Hello, Rex Breath. Okay. Okay. Guys, I have a weird question. How come Xenoblade is just like so mainstream? Because like I look at the game and my exposure to Xenoblade is through Smash Bros. So my exposure to Xenoblade is like, okay, there's two characters I know from the series. They're both women with like gigantic jiggly fake titties. Like this is a Guna porn game, right? But seemingly it's also very mainstream. That doesn't make sense to me. Usually something that's so blatantly just porn is not mainstream. I guess the closest to that is One Piece. But like One Piece, at least like people hate it. I mean, I like One Piece except for the Guna stuff. I like it despite that, not because of it. An attractive woman, total Guna slob. Yeah, that's exactly what I said. Sure. But the game isn't porn. Really? Really? Okay, I guess if you just Google Xenoblade you don't find too much of it. But it's like this woman here, she's... I mean, she's basically porn. Yeah, you... yeah. What do you find when you shop for it? Do you find these figurines? No, surprisingly.  You know what's so crazy now? As soon as you see like even 30-40 Princess Peach fanarts, your whole timeline is full of them. Huh. Yeah, crazy. Only 30-40. What a joke. Yeah, exactly, Pyrimithra. They are very Guni to me. No porn from Xenoblades? Let's see what that is. What is that about us?  90% of anime is Guni? I don't think it's 90%, but there is certainly a large percentage of it that is pretty Guna-ish. I mean, if Xenoblade was the only game ever that came out that had smaller vision, then actually yes, I would play it. Because I like gaming for the new experiences, and that is something that I would not be able to experience anywhere else. I don't know. What is that? I have to move origin to hotkey. How is there no hotkey? Origin. That fucking sucks. There has to be a hotkey for it. It used to be CTRL-SHIFT. What the hell? Where is it? It's on right-click the object. I never thought to right-click anything in this new version. This is better, but it's still too big. We need way more mushrooms. Well, it's the new version of the controls, I guess. Honestly, I'm not sure if we need texture with mushrooms anymore, because now we have these 3D mushrooms. The 3D mushrooms are chill as fuck. Look at them. Yeah, it would have to be very blurry mushrooms, I think. Or maybe something that only works with the two textures combined. It's difficult to make a floor like that look good. He jumped 0.2 versions. So? Do you know how big the jump from 2.79 to 2.80 was? That's just 0.01 versions. Right click has been in Blender for 500 years. Yeah, but the right click used to be the selection tool and the left click used to be to move the dot. True, mushroom cluster decods, that's probably the right play. You hear that, Zeina? Can you take the grass out of it? And just have a pile of mushrooms on transparent background? I think that is what we need. Didn't used to be anything, you just didn't import your controls? Yeah! Exactly. Hello Siark. Can you say hi to Siark? Hi Siark. Hi Siark. Hi Siark. Southern Marucat weakening wants some progress and it's 26 complete, co-op wise. Oh, that is cool as fuck. Marucat Wii is the best one. Who wants to fight about it? Just kidding, no one would fight me on that. We all know that Marucat Wii is the best one. And I think this one isn't even the situation of like, oh this is the one I grew up with, of course it's the best one. I genuinely think it is just the best one. Marucat Wii sucks ass and I'm taking the bait. No! I actually like it the most. Marucat 7? On the free DS? Dang. Right, we need to make the inside of the windmill now. I forgot. That looks like a cool fucking rabbit hole though. Okay, I'm not saying it looks good, I just like the gameplay aspects of it. Because one, it has wheelies. Wheelies add a lot, because on Marucat I find that a lot of the time I just get bored driving forward. The wheelie, you know, gives me more stuff to do. Gives me this little thing to focus at least a small percentage of my mind on. Then also the online mode is very punishing if you lose, if you have like a high rating. Which is necessary for an online mode rating to be designed in a way where it actually means something if you have a lot of points. And then lastly, all the tricks that you can learn in Marucat Wii, you can learn just by playing the game. You don't have to go online and talk to a bunch of nerds, you can just play the game a lot and then you figure everything out. Okay. Hello, Satellaguy. It counts how much does widescreen affect FPS? We can check that real quick. Let's see. It will depend on the scene, for sure. The game doesn't start? Really? Oh, nevermind. These textures are Leela's fault. Alright, we got 36 FPS right now. Let's turn on widescreen. We got 33.5. So not that much of a difference. Why was it all flowers? Ask Leela. This one's at like 52.5. And now it's like 55, 56. Yeah, it's barely a loss. Can you believe how good this looks for real N64? Dang, bro. Wow. Thank you, Windows Security. We have a few issues, though. Wow. Oops. Have you not seen my old TX shot trick? I've made like 3 or 4 Ocarina of Time hacks. That's great news, Biobak. I think so, too. Okay. That might be an issue with the ROMEC tool, Shairo. I can hopefully fix that before the final version. I sent the mushroom cluster. Let's see what we got. Is this indexed to 16 colors, Zainab? Okay. No. Ah! Okay, I have to do that then. I guess I need to download GIMP. Or was it Krita? Krita is the one you wanted me to use? Chat. That does look pretty nice. You didn't know Missing Link was me? What? It's the best tech ever. I made it. I actually was gonna make a video about a Missing Link update. Let's see. Okay. Krita download. See how this works. Windows installer. Hopefully that didn't fuck my stream. Okay. Some dimension for Utopia? No. What about future proofing? Yep, I read all that. Fucking...  I don't want to open Krita on Bing! What do you mean? Where is it? Okay. I don't want to open Krita on Bing.   Okay. Huh? Okay. This image looks... It just oozes blue sky to me. I bet if I google Tyson10 I find him in blue sky. Nevermind, I found him on Twitter. Crazy. Okay, now it is on blue sky too. Just like what I thought. Okay. How do I index the 16 colours in Krita?  Palettize. What the hell? Okay, I want to do it right now, right here. I need to be able to edit this. Because I don't know what colour you put in the transparent pixels either, for example. Okay. You don't know how? It's a very important functionality.  Let's index two colours. Artistic posturize. Is what they say. Okay. Is this actually it though? Is this actually it? This doesn't seem right to me.  Bit depth. Bit depth. Wait, where? On the colours? I guess that was on the filter. There is no bit depth here. Post it in Discord how to index colours. Let's do it. Let's see it. Oops, I didn't mean to open this. Wait, filter and then index colours? Wait, what? There is suddenly way more options here? Oh, nevermind, I went to posturize before. And... Yeah. This is way too many options for me. Ah! That looks awful. Is there no auto-picking it?  Keeping with the solution. Yeah, Biobak, but I want... Ideally, I would like to be able to work in one program. And I get that Photopea online is decent, but I don't want to rely on an online tool. So this is just not good. Thanks for watching! Well, this doesn't do what I need. Even Posterize was better. So, Krita is not usable. Krita doesn't have the features we need. I can try Gimp again, I guess. That sucks. And I guess we have to download Gimp. Krita doesn't work. Yeah, even you used Gimp, even though you're only using Krita usually. Let's try Gimp. Paint.net. That sounds derivative of paint, and that makes me want to not use it. What the fuck. Okay, you know what? Fuck you. Went sonic over the creator folder. I don't care. Okay. I don't have photoshop anymore. My game design is pretty good. It does more for painting, drawing. Only nice thing, I can see where yours has tiling texture mode. I used to use GIMP a little bit, but I don't like it that much, yeah. I find its workflow a little cumbersome. But GIMP has consistently been the most functional tool. But I also only had GIMP 2, now there's GIMP 3, so this is probably completely different. This texture is going to look really good though in the end, I think, the mushroom cluster. But I do need to start with the HD version here, because we need the alpha layer to have the correct color. It's just old photoshop. I see. Well, the issue with photoshop is that photoshop cannot put color in transparent pixels, which is very important for 3D modeling. So, I would like to not use photoshop. Okay, layers, oh shit, we have layers, that is the wrong one, how do I duplicate the layer? Like that, and then can I make this black? I can make this black, can I make this dark green? Trouble, oh, here, nope. Basically, I want this to look like a shadow on the grass. You put blue shadows on all of these, Zeina? That's a little weird and might ruin everything, but we'll try. So, can I make this opacity one? Good. Yes. Okay, it's a little ugly.  Now, Gimp used to have an issue where if you export with 16 colors, it actually would put 17 colors in there. Let's see if that worked, or if it actually puts 17 colors in here. It did not put 17 colors in there. Okay, that's cool. Let me take a look at this exported file. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, okay, yep, 32 bytes, that's exactly 16 colors. Nice! They fixed that bug! I think so too, UNIDEF. But it kind of works. I will have to make sure that there's no color applied to it though, like so. Is there a way to remove everything that's semi-transparent? You send one without the shadows? Okay. Oh, you already scaled this down? Did you change the background color? I don't think you did, so I can't use yours. I'm talking about the color of the transparent pixels. Which you might think, transparent pixels, how do they have a color? They do. There's still a lot of colors. I think the purple mushrooms might have to go. I'm thinking a dark green is perfect for the background. Interesting. If you want to cut off semi-transparent, you can go to colors, curves, then select the option and cut off the lower values. Colors, curves. This is doing alpha? Oh wait, when you select the channel. Oh, nice. Send. You added an opaque green background. You see how I have a 1% opacity green background here? That's kind of what you need. Do they still have the magic selection tool? Oh no, I don't see the magic selection tool. Oh fuck. How do I use GIMP without the magic selection tool? Does this expand? Is Photoshop here? No. No, this is the magic one tool. I want the one where you just select something and it selects everything it thinks you want to select. And then you can shrink and increase your selection. Okay. Otherwise, I have to very carefully go around the border like this. It's annoying.  Who likes doing this? Why is it you need that semi-transparent background? So the background pixel color is filled correctly. Transparent pixels have a color too. And the N64's bilinear filtering will blend your textures into the background's color. So just because a pixel is opaque in your texture, doesn't mean it has no effect at your texture in-game. What is going to happen if you just leave it a blank color, then it will blend into that color. So in Photoshop, Photoshop has a thing where it always exports the transparent pixels as being fully white. So if you ever export a transparent texture with bilinear filtering from Photoshop, you're going to get a model in-game with a white outline. And it is extremely, extremely ugly. You can hold shift while using the magic stuff. Oh god, no, that's not what I want. It was called like the smart selection tool or something. Okay. That's not it. What the fuck? Get me back! I want out of here. Yeah, it looks like they removed that. It was such a good tool. Why would they remove that? It was like the best tool. Okay. All right, let's change the hue and saturation of that.  Shit, where is scale? Here.  Yeah, this program feels a lot better than Krita. Way better, to me. Oh, you've seen the white outline before? What happened to my blender? Hello? Oh no, my computer is crashing. I hope I don't get a blue screen. I might get a blue screen right now. Wait, you're right. It changed it back to purple. What is going on? I can't do anything. Hello?  My entire PC is frozen. It's very easy to just click and drag the magic mantle a few times and clean it up manually. Nope, it's way slower. I tried it just now. That was nonsense. I don't know what to do. I can't use my PC right now. Task manager. Okay, I can use my PC again. How come when I scale this down, my image transformation disappears? You see that? Now it's purple again. Now it's orange again. What the fuck? Also, this just looks like Photoshop now. What the fuck is filter layers? Click the FX button. This? No. It's gone again. What the fuck? That's what I have to do? That is so annoying. Holy shit. What did I do? What? Why is it producing such a garbage palette? It must be bugged out, right? Now it produces a decent palette. Did you see that? It is bugged out. I haven't even been using the software for 10 minutes. I basically did nothing in the software and I already found a pretty bad bug like that. Where it just generated a garbage palette. Why aren't you using layers for this? What do you mean layers? Which layers do you want me to use for this? This is the image I got in. There is no layers I can use. What would I even put on layers? Thought that maybe using a mask and not rescaling it. Well it definitely looked like it did something like that, yeah. Well that's an annoying program. I didn't draw the mushrooms. I was given a texture of mushrooms. And my mission was to rescale the texture to fit within the limitations of a Nintendo 64 game. Okay. Alright, let's get a feeling for this in-game. Too many unique colors to fit into a CI4. Remember when I praised it for fixing the bug where they put too many colors when you put 16 colors? Well they didn't fucking fix it after all. You need to put 15 colors to get 16 colors. That is annoying. Game moment. I suppose so. Yeah, I think it's counting the transparent background, not as a color. And that's the problem. Photoshop can do a palette limit and it has some really nice options for it, but Photoshop cannot do a background color. So you will always get white outlines around the entire thing. So you remember how in GIMP we made a dark green background here? If you look at the texture here you can see around the blue there's a dark yellow outline now. Or dark green. That's what this layer does here, the 1% opacity. Dark green layer. That's what you see right here. In Photoshop this outline will always be black. And the only way to prevent the outline is to not use filtering on your textures. The transparency is not just the 16th color. The transparency has a color and that is dark green. Yeah, but it's stupid not to count transparency if you're gonna export a color on transparency, right? Because clearly there's a color on there. Photoshop can bind past MFTG and Alpha to not separate. The Photoshop bug is fixable is what you're saying? I have had people tell me that before and every time I tried their fixes it didn't work. And to be honest I am not willing to try a fix anymore. Because I have spent too much time on that already. Anyway, we got some pretty nice mushrooms here now. Very mushroomy area. I like it. And I think we are ready to move towards the next part of the overworld. Which is gonna be a very very small part because that's all there is here. Just this beach here. And then we're gonna have to make Bowser's oil tanker the next time we get here. And we still need to make waves and stuff. I guess we also have to do the forest. We still need to make a background for the overworld too. That's gonna be interesting. Anyway, that finishes... oh wait I still need to do the tree. That would finish part 10. And then there's just 11, 12 and 13 left. But for today I am definitely done. So I will see you guys in the next stream whenever that may be. Bye bye!
