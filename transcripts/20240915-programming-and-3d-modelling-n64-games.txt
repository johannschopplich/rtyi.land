Hello. Oh no. Hello. And for a four. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Let's say if zero undefined F10 is normal. Okay. So zero is an issue. What the fuck was that? That is true onion get out of someone. Do we have any OSC wishes for the day? Anyone would like to listen to something. I don't know. Let's do it. Still trying to figure out where exactly this crash is. Because this is such a big function. I think it's an empty access title. Right here somewhere. Likely. Okay. This is actually the thing I just did. I just recorded a video talking to chance to be T01. And I think it really changed this function to have a crash in it. Which sucks. So let me check my most recent comments. Okay. She just changed something in the game. I think it's because it's a stealth and it's hot, then most likely it was turned on. Today is squad day. That's why maybe my mood is a little, you know. Yeah, that's what a crash was. All right. Well, I guess I have to fix that. Right now, I just want to look if I have any optimizations here. If the frame rate has gotten any better. Hard to say, honestly. Let me see what my last notes were. This was at 21.98. Seems about right. 0.54, 0, 21.35. Okay. This is improved. 22.85. That's a lot worse. Interesting. 0.97, 15.15. Okay. So more idle. That's good. Scared 0.37. That's less. 0.725 less. What really matters is Ren. Ren went to 5.2. That shouldn't be. Game loop is half a second more. Doesn't make much sense to me. I must have made changes to course one that the FPS has gotten worse. Hmm. Make for a good clickbait thumbnail. On the N64 hardware. I don't know about that. So I guess I got this wrong. So there's nine scale indices. That is correct. Okay. Well, this will be an issue. These values are garbage. We go in J through first. J is minus five. Minus one and three. And then with I set to one, it's minus four. Zero and two. And then it's minus three. One and five. Wait. So which ones do we not go through? Minus two. Just minus two is skipped. That doesn't sound right to me. Am I crazy? This seems a lot worse. All right. Well, I will undo this optimization from chat. Cool. Let me just edit the video. Another stream. Yep. Actually, I'll just delete the video. I haven't uploaded it yet anyway. I will edit that in the video. Cool. In 64 Sigma. But did you made your plan to? I don't know what a major is. All right. We want to make more assets for this. I'm just going to find where we were. Maybe I'm going to cardboard. There we go. Cardboard bridges, cardboard mountains. We got those. We have the lamp here. Perfect. Perfect. His name is sick. Mario and the eminence. Because he's evil. Dang, dude, that's insane. Yep, this will be course 14. It's the cardboard level. Everything is made out of cardboard and craft materials. It would make sense if this course was on a giant table. The one reason I want to maybe not make this course be on a giant table is that if I do that, it looks like you can go to the bottom. And I want there to be a death floor. So maybe we need to innovate a different way to make a death floor look. By the way, this newest video. Fucking look at this. It's doing so well. It's got like 80% more views than my last video. And this one got how many? 270,000. This might be a 1 million view banger. This gives you blue sky and this ocean vibes. Maybe. Hello, Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic the Hedgehog, you're someone who cares a lot about AI and stuff, right? You love talking about that. Just this morning, I tested CGPT01, the new coding model. I did a lot of stuff wrong, but it actually helped a little bit. It's because of the editing style. The editing style definitely helps. That's sick. Yes, I have an editor now. It's not myself anymore. This is actually something I wanted to discuss in stream. We need to plan the content. Maybe I'm unprofessional for talking about this. Fuck it. Who cares? You guys are special. You guys get the special treatment. So these are the video ideas I have. It's like 20 different videos. Which one do you think we should do next? The first one is why everyone was wrong about the N64, including me. Where I would be talking about how actually it's no longer the memory throughput that's the bottleneck. Once you actually optimize that, it's the RSP. I'm not entirely comfortable making this video yet, because there's so much RSP stuff I don't understand yet. And Sauraen is still working on RSP stuff. Then the mod Nintendo doesn't want you to know about. The missing link. I could talk about the hack I made that Nintendo took down. Maybe make a small version update. I think this one would go hard. And I definitely want to re-release missing link at some point. Mario 64 beta assets. There's probably like half an hour of content I could talk about. It's just things Nintendo left in the ROM. Maybe a video on F3DX. The Game Boy Advance interview. This is a planned thing. Obscure and useless Mario 64 knowledge. I think this one could do really well. Course 1 rework, rework, rework. It definitely won't be a video. The hardware bugs. Maybe a progress update on the other hack. Terror bots I had to deal with. I had really funny ones. And then maybe some basic explanation videos I had. Like mirrors, infinite stairs, paintings. The file select glitch. Maybe oddities in Mario 64 source code. Because there's some really crazy things. Maybe I could use Nintendo's 3D modeling tool to make an SM64 level. And this one is also just talking about Mario Sunshine on the N64. The missing links could be shorts. Yeah, but no one watches shorts. Oh, right, Cassini. That's true. How's the demo going? Biobak is currently still working on the Course 1 remake. I want that to be in the demo. I try to crop up the performance more to 10 min max for standard console. Then full breakdown for no longer full. I think the algorithm on YouTube likes a lot if you have like 30 minute videos. Or even longer than that. Enemies. So in this level I was thinking an enemy could be just a scissor that cuts you. I think that could be really good as an enemy. But it doesn't really fit craft materials. Oh, dang. I had no idea, Sonic. That is really sad. Who took Bloodborne cart down? Nice job, Tiberius. Tape that slows you down. Definitely planned. Definitely planned. Glue segment here. Hello, Innovator. This is an enemy. What's this? Oh, yeah, this. This is a crazy enemy that I want in this level. We could also use the elements we have right now to try and make some of the level. These we don't really need yet. Glue. Glue balls you can stick to. Maybe glue moving. Well, yeah, let's do that. Pad and Coke shots are great. But I don't want to put that much effort into it. For me, YouTube at this point.  This the job part and like making the game is the fun part. OK, so I want to put glue somewhere and that will be just killing your jumps. Yeah. Have I played Splatoon? Nope How does glue look like when you put it on cardboard? It's like the shiny substance, right? Play that's fun. A shoe tower on sticks just doesn't sound very fun to me. But maybe it is fun. What do I know? The everyone was wrong video, I definitely want to make it. It's just that at the moment, I don't think I have all the required tools to make the video. I don't want to get it wrong, because it's very easy to get that wrong. It has motion controls. Oh, OK, that's a lot better. But if we have move them and walking on them and Mario 64 jumps up and moves, that's exactly what I have planned. I remember 8-4 from Mario 64 lens, kind of like that. So it's got purple blue. I like the white glue I just saw. We need something that's like paint brush lines, but also a little bit crazy. Hello, Voisel. I just have three more days of vacation and then it's back to work. Actually, no, it's Wednesday. I have to go back to work. So it's just two days after today. Glue shake, no. Actually, I think I might have something fitting in my woods for the tremors, but a lot of watercolor paint and mixing. I don't want to make a painting of a star now. There's going to be a star where you pick up a crayon to draw a star, but that's it. Or a marker, because where you have crayons as platforms, I wouldn't want them to be something that you pick up and walk on. That kind of looks like glue. Multiplying them kind of works. This is not cum stains, this is glue. Let me just make sure it actually looks like this in game. Looks like fuck. In case I'm being awful to me, I'm going to cry. What did you just tune into? Making a level. A night tail of glue looks too new to look like a cump. What is a cump? Do you think this is too opaque? Or what are you saying? I do not understand. How does this not change the visuals at all? What's the background going to be? That's a good question. I'm not sure yet, and we really should be figuring it out soon. Yes, Mario will get stuck when he walks on this. Yes, it's a Mario game. No one's going to think like, oh, Nintendo wanted to put cum on this. Everyone's going to realize it's glue. Wait, Mario got the S? Like what? A zigzaggy pattern? I kind of tried that with the second picture here, but maybe it doesn't look like that enough. Maybe I can use a more broad pattern to make that work. What did I use anyway? I used this. Yeah, it's not zigzaggy enough. Maybe if I Google glue texture. That doesn't really look like glue. Hello, Biobak. Biofront? Okay, I'll take that back. Put a glue stick near it? I don't like that idea. I don't want this to look unfinished, you know. Please don't mark out the S guy. Why? Which one? There's like a million ones. The history of Elmo's glue. I don't like that.      Oh, this is what you mean. Purple glue? I have never seen purple glue. I want it to look like the circular ones that you do. Even Mario got the S from? No, send me a picture. I have no idea which one you're talking about. It's like a million Mario got the S once. Rayman raving rabbits? Should I send it in chat? Just upload it to Imgur or something. I want like this. You see this pattern here? This is what I want. Do you think maybe I can just draw it on Photoshop? Do you remember purple glue? Was it tasty? It smelled better, but it didn't taste better. Oh, okay. What the hell? They don't have a glue pattern on here? I don't know. Many, many small splats. Maybe I can just draw something. Now that I think about it. What is this? Why does it paint like this? Is it maybe exactly what I need? To make this small enough. Why is it black? Hello, I would like to draw a white place. What the fuck? Oh, wait. That's the wrong tool. I don't know. I can't do this. What do you think of a glue squiggle? Let me see that glue squiggle. I'm not sure I understand. Like this? No. Can I send it in Discord? Can you just send it in YouTube chat? Or tag me on my Discord? Can I open my Discord? Yes, I can. Hmm. I want this. This looks so good. Send me the text on Discord. Let me check my messages. I don't see it. Spirograph? What is that? Maybe that works. No. Look at friend requests. Can't you just send me a message request? I have 87 friend requests. I don't know which one you are. I'll just accept everyone that starts with a W. Maybe you're in there. Hmm. And just to be safe, Hinovato as well. So H. Alright, I just accepted 5 friend requests. Maybe one of them is you. He did that. Send me a message request. I don't see one. Oh wait. This one. You want a background like this? No, that's way too low-res. This is gonna look way too crunchy in this level. We can't do that. What if we just...  Surely this should be decent, right? Wait. This is the wrong direction, is it not? What is level 11?       Still not a fan of that spider doing nothing at all. Maybe I've inverted this again. Eh. Let's try this, I think this looks decent. Is it an artcrafts theme level? Yes it is. This one isn't low res. Well if it's high res it's not gonna look good either. Because it's gonna be too high res. I think the problem is the image itself. I don't think a 2D image as a background ever works here. I also don't think that the background is... Oh, okay now you have individual textures. Yes, this would be a lot better. Eh, still, it needs to fit on the level, right? So I'm trying to make Sunshine 164. Start working on it. This seems like the kind of project that 15.000 people talk about and they all say it's gonna be made and then no one makes it. Like the Mario 64 Beat'em Project. Paper, soap and glue. I think this is good now. I like this. But yeah, we should think about the bottom and the background. Because it's gonna change a lot about the aesthetic. Biobak was suggesting that there would be like... That this whole thing would be inside a paper cylinder. And the paper cylinder is gonna have stuff drawn onto it. And I think that works really well. But that leaves the question open what is gonna be at the bottom. I could probably just have like a cylinder around this with some clouds drawn on. Have it be pure blue with some simple clouds. That would work well. Maybe some paint splooshes on it to make it look rough. I don't want origami. Goombas, I want them made out of like pipe cleaners. Stuff like that. Like the Sunshine Trip, yeah, yeah, that's a good example. Water at the bottom. Hmm, that would kind of work. We could just fade out into the sky color at the bottom, that would be good enough. The problem with the desk is that people might think they can walk on it and we don't want the player to think they can walk on it. No, I don't want this to look unfinished, so no gloom bottle. Let's see how we can make this look like it's just paper around this. Cotton balls, oh, that could look cool. How much do I need to rotate this? 1660 divided by 32, 11.25. Let's see how we can make this look like it's just paper around this. Background, dark brick wall, ceiling lights. Yeah, I want this to look like it's placed on a desk or something. But I can't have a desk be the actual background, so this puts me in a bit of a weird situation. How does Mario get in these levels? We'll figure something out. Now, how do we make this look like rough paint? Yeah, carpet doesn't fix the problem. It still looks like something you can walk on. You have paper lined at the bottom with pencil drawn rocks. Yes, yes. I have never really used x86. I only looked at a little bit of code and yeah, it's a lot more of a nightmare than MIPS. MIPS is a lot simpler. Let's see if I can find anything paint. That looks very painted. That's pretty good. Now, how do we get the painted look? There's like clear strokes. The more central skybox section. All right, let me see that. Hmm, doesn't look very painted to me, unfortunately. Doesn't really work that way. Yeah. A black desk? Yeah, we have to make a bottomless pit somehow. Just don't know what it would be like. I don't get the junk either, the mellow. It is what it is. Glow-in-the-dark stickers? The level is not going to be in the dark, so that's not really... A cobblestone texture? Let me check that. That's an interesting idea. Hello, Winged Man. We had books as platforms too. I was thinking about books, but I never really decided on it. Hmm.  Maybe this one in blurred? That's not the correct one. It's this one. Let's see if your idea has any merit to it. Oh, what if I do emotion blur? I think emotion blur could work. Wait, what? This texture doesn't tile? This fucking texture doesn't tile? Who made this? I don't know. What the hell? I think that could work. Maybe actually more. Let's try it. The cobblestone texture was actually really interesting. Like an interesting idea. Hmm. Hmm. It doesn't look good. It doesn't look good. Unfortunately. This is some painted level? Yeah, some of it is painted. Other parts are made out of cardboard. Yeah, it doesn't look like it's painted on. It just looks like some blue something. Shit. Is he a shoebox diorama? That way the level is contained if a player steps out of the shoebox and unless they die? Well, this is bigger than a shoebox, but you have the idea. Yoshi's Story backgrounds? Oh, wait, let's see that. Hmm. Hmm. This is pretty much just a solid color with some paper cutouts on it. Hmm. Not quite. Need a better card protector? Probably. These aren't really meant to be final. Mario goes onto a color palette and changes colors? Nah, that's not a mechanic I want in this level. Raving Rabbids CBA? I can take a look. Is this the first level? I don't really see it. Can you use a picture of construction paper? Construction paper? Oh, that's pretty good. Yeah. But I would prefer if it was just roughly painted on. Like painted ocean. Child? Yeah, like when you can see the strokes here. That's what I want. Yes, that's already a mechanic shadow bar. Hmm. Oh, this would work great for the glue. This could work if it's seamless. I will try this. Please tell me it's seamless. Oh my god, it is. How is this going to look at 64x64? Oh, honestly, not terrible. Oh. I'm not a fan of origami. Permission denied? Okay. Needs to be brighter, but then I think it works. Yeah. Are you thinking of first increasing the this here and then scaling it down? We can try that. Which down is getting me thinking? Let's move by linear? By cubic sharpen? Yo, thank you for the 28. Very much appreciated. That's a long ass time. Oh yeah, that's a lot sharper.  Looks great, really? Hmm. I think this can be better. I feel like it might not render correctly at all. Can I texturize going forward with this? Like paint it on a piece of paper? Yeah. To increase the render distance here. We need to plop some clouds on this too, so it doesn't look so barren. Honestly, I'm just not sold on it yet. I also don't think this combiner is very fitting for this. This part works a bit better. Is my cloud texture? I want the clouds to look more drawn. I think what we have in Peach's Fury is good. Eh, they're not looking drawn enough. No, I haven't tried Mario Clips. I'm not really interested in it. It should be propped up by something. Right now it looks a little flimsy. We really need to think about the bottom part here. I like how the colors play together though. We get cyan instead of deep blue. The top part is kind of cyan, isn't it? Yeah, it's adding sunflares. Oh, I add them to all the really strong lines and all the suns. I think they look very neat. Oh yes, we're only at quest 14 out of 15. But of course there's some side levels missing, the overworld and the bowser level. But quest 15 is also already halfway done because I already programmed all the assets for it, for the slide deck I made with Eiza. So yeah, it's actually looking pretty good. Cotton balls, what's up? The problem is, cotton balls at the entire bottom, that's gonna be so high poly, isn't it? How are we gonna do that without insane amount of lag? This level is gonna be very difficult to make run well on N64 because of how open it is. Should I bring him in the classroom or something? No. I think we're just gonna have a ceiling. Beyond the paper here. There is no normal map functionality now. The most I can do. And this might actually look fucking sick. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It gives me an idea. Shall I add a fake normal map to this? So that when you turn the camera, there's like highlights like this moving. Oh, that would look so good. Oh, that would be so nice. Shiny paint. Yeah, paint is always shiny. It's fitting, I think. What is this God awful song? Dracula's ringtone true. Not what I wanted, actually. Does this rainbow, right? Even though it's course 15 because of itself. Hello, ladies, maybe welcome to the stream. Can you get away with using shell texturing to your lower poly cotton balls? What is shell texturing? All right. Second question. How do we compute the glowiness of this? So how does it usually glow? The more you look at it, the more it glows. Or the less you look at it, the more it glows. It's like if the angle between the light source and your eye matches, right? Like a mirror. So the angle to the light source is here. Meaning if you're here, you're looking this way. This should be glowing. If you're looking this way, this should be glowing. I guess because it's a circle, we get some special privileges here. Where it's just whatever you look at glows. That should work. What's going to be any good? Shell texturing is when you double-lay the energy along the normal and sample some texture based on your offsets. How am I supposed to do that on the N64? I guess I can shift the texture, but then we are double overdrawing it. That is so expensive. No, on the N64, that's too expensive. That's true. So we have minRimBrightness, plus this, multiplied by rimBrightnessRange. And then this we probably want to be like 40. This should be a pretty cheap effect that looks really good. I can't tell if the effect is there. I'm going to turn this shit up to like 20 to see what happens. Texture the outer model with a different texture and use alpha to make it appear to have a raised layer of fuzz. Yeah, the effect is not there. Did I export this? Did I set this to 34? It's at 91. Okay, now what should happen is the texture overflows and goes to... Okay, that part works. Now we just need this good. Maybe something like that is better. I can't see the effect happening. I mean, it's there, but it is so weak that I don't see it. Is this just me being insane? Do you guys see the effect? What the hell? It's like it's always at max brightness, is it not? Oh, no, I can see it fade in here. This is too small, I think. Eps angle diff should matter more. We can just multiply this by four. And that should work. I think now it will be visible enough. It's not supposed to be quite like the ice walls, but a similar effect. Oh, what the hell? Oh, wait a second. Hello, Davey. No, it should be really strong. I still see it, but it's not what I want. Um, it's not what I want. Should this be negative? It should be. How long does it take to finish? That depends on the level. All right, that's doing something. Now I just need to make the effect stronger. Now that it's right. Hello, cream team. It's going well. My favorite dinosaur. Shit, I don't have one. Oh, yeah, there we go. It's too strong now, I think. But now we know it works for sure. I think that's enough. It's a craft level. It's made out of craft materials. Oh, yeah, that's a nice effect. I like it at least. Still, the one thing that really bothers me is the floor. We need something for the floor. Cotton balls. I could make a hex tessellated floor and have like each individual hex kind of look like a cotton ball. But it's going to look really grummy. It's going to look a little bit poopy. And be relatively expensive for how poopy it looks. So I don't like that. Let's move one of the ends towards the center. Put tape over the two ends so it looks like a piece of paper folded into a circle. That's a good idea. There should be a seam. See what you mean. Something like this. Favorite fruit. I'll take apple. Recommended human FPS. The higher you can run the human, the better. I'm thinking the view map is really easy here. I can just scale it slightly. Now the human level looks poopy. Putting a seam, maybe do it by the lamp. As if they tried to make the circle, but the lamp got in the way. Nah, the idea is that someone actually just made this. So there has to be a seam somewhere. Because this is what it would be like if someone made this. This doesn't have to be applied well either. I can just... You just need to have the same thickness. Could you use a shadow on the outer part of the seam to sell the effect and give some depth to the inside edge? I don't understand, I'm not sure I understand you right. Shadow on the outer part of the seam, what is the outer part of the seam? The thing that's further in the middle? Give some depth to the inside edge. Why would they have a shadow on this thing in the middle? Doesn't make any sense to me. The end of the seam that's under the other end. So the thing behind it should have a shadow? Yeah, yeah, definitely. We can do that. I haven't really thought about doing that part yet. I mean, it doesn't look good yet right now, but that's something for later. Vertex coloring is not our priority right now. I need a piece of tape. Tape is transparent. What does tape look like? Shiny and transparent. Easy, take the ice protection and stretch it. I don't think we even need to do that. That already looks like tape to me. Screen reading to fit the level theme. 2D sections like Mario Odyssey, but instead of 8-bit they're styled like Super Paper Mario. No, I don't like those 2D sections. I want this to be a 3D game entirely. My tape looks right to me. I like my tape. Oh yeah, that's pretty nice. The seam is on the wrong side as well. That fixes it. Spiky cuts at the edges. Yeah, you're right. Don't worry about it. There we go. They don't have to be perfect, they're never perfect when you do that. Still the one thing I'm worried about the most is the bottom. I'm looking at Schubert's dioramas here, but nothing really sticks out to me as something we can use. It could be a piece of paper with like lava drawn onto it as the floor. The problem is lava doesn't look good here. Just the color of lava I feel like doesn't mesh well with the level. What game is this? I'm making this game right now. It's called Return to Yoshi's Island. Water made out of paper from the bottom would fit. Water made out of paper, that's an interesting idea. How do you make water out of paper? Crumbled up paper would look really good, but crumbled up paper is way too expensive to render. Aluminium foil painted blue, that's a crazy idea. Is there blue aluminium foil? Which one is it? Like this, or wrap paper. Would have to be a texture. Almost glue quicksand, we have something like that. Made water out of paper in World 2, but it's probably just like the zigzags that you see from the side, right? They always do that. Rambos, what is a rambo? Oh, no, no, no, or actually maybe, but I think I prefer this. A terrarium? I see what you mean, but that doesn't really fit the idea for this level. Was she Kozo? Was she Kozo? Oh, that's a material. Well, but if it's aluminium, then we just have reflective light on it, right? I'm going to try aluminium foil. Okay, fine, I'll be going with water. I don't know if it was what you said. I don't understand. So, we don't actually want this to be perfectly hexagonal. I just have hex desolation as a base here. Are we coming in both sections? Oh, I remember that section. This? I don't know about this. That's also not what we're talking about, is it? Where is he actually on the boat? Here we go. Yeah, I don't really see it. I want to try the aluminium foil. No one told me what the word is pronounced like yet. I do not know the law, please don't arrest me. Origami King had one very clear point to me, and that was it felt like an experiment. Nintendo did to see how fun they can make a game with zero extrinsic motivation. The entire game just exists for you to play it for the sake of playing it. And it failed. I had some fun with it, but I agree that it would have been better if there was an RPG system to it. How does the song request work? Channel points? Usually it would just be like you collect channel points and then you hit the song requests. But I don't think I still have that feature. The problem with that feature for me is that I cannot see who redeems what, because I am multistreaming now and it doesn't show me when people redeem stuff on Twitch. So unless someone explicitly tells me that a song request was redeemed, there is a 0% chance I would ever see it. I am not sold on the Illumina motion, if this even qualifies as such. Don't search for ideas for a crafty level? If you have ideas, I will listen to them, but I am not explicitly searching for ideas. I am always open to suggestions. Does the flex reward do? You just flex your points, I guess. Passing quest? Did they do broke? What? The whole level is above a giant trash bin? But wouldn't everything fall in? We can't have it be a desk, because if it's a desk, then it looks like play area and people are going to jump down and die. Yeah, this just doesn't look good. I was thinking the retro section in this level would be Mario Paint inspired, because that's like the artist game. How is this section now? I haven't actually checked it. The distance between should be just fine. Button swaps? Let me google that. That seems really high poly. Yeah, blue aluminum was a good idea. There's some really cool stuff in this game here. Seamless cut on half ball texture? I'm not sure what that is. You mean just the texture that looks like a bunch of these seen from above? I think I would look really bad, unfortunately. So there's more glue? Yeah, I saw that. Splooches of glue? We can definitely do that. I mean glue is a planned stage element, so it probably will exist. But right now we just want to put individual stage elements, so that we can actually plan out the level. I don't want to think about every little piece. I just need the big wall picture and then I can do it. Just red paper with a pattern that could resemble waves and could have a roll of the same similitude on the wall on the far like the mountains or scissors? Red paper sounds good. I mean red paper with waves. Something like this could work. And then we just have like three lanes of this. Mod Podge? This person crafts. What are these things? Oh, I don't even know what this is. But we could use a disgusting pattern like this. This pattern is a bit less disgusting. Same with this, but this is too big to tile. This is just disgusting. Man. Maybe we can just use a wave pattern and put that on the wrap. Hello, Rosie Sapphire. Hello, hello. It's the same disgusting pattern. But I want something in this style, just not awful. Hmm. Not every level has a boss. This one should not have a boss. I did not have one planned. Make you the boss? You want to be the boss of the level? You want to go around on Twitch telling people you're the boss? Do you add seamless to the search query? I did not. I mean, it might help. I usually only do that after trying this. Because usually when you add seamless to it, you don't actually find anything seamless. And pattern can imply seamless, right? Man. I just wanted to look like gift wrap paper. I would hope that these are seamless. Hmm. What am I just trying to scale this one down? Is this even seamless? Maybe the fighting can just be executed better? Maybe. I see little hope though, to be honest. Can I tile this better? Does this even tile well? Kind of boss. Interesting. I don't care about AI. I'm fine with using it. But I don't have a lot of trust in AI. TTYD? Wait. What does that look like? Wait, why don't I just use a water pattern I already have? I have a million water patterns. What if one of those works? By the way, I don't think that tiling was the issue. I think the issue was that I can't find a decent pattern. Hmm. How would someone play your hack if they wanted to use an N64? The best thing to do would be to get one of those Chinese knockoff Everdrives. They're very cheap and you can play all my N64 compatible hacks on those. None of these... Actually, this one has the gift wrap aesthetic to it. I think something like this could work. Although this seam here doesn't seem obvious enough. I want the seam to be really obvious. Maybe I can use a multi-touch on top. Oops. Oh wait, I can't. Oh, but this makes the skin look a lot more like some graph paper. No, it doesn't do anything. Hmm. Lots of blue. Yeah, I think it's too much blue too. We definitely need to put these on the floor again. Even... I mean, actually, what I just did was bad. Fun fact! This renders a lot faster on the N64 than the other way. What if you make the background more paper graph like something you would use... Oh wait, I already read that. Add some depth and height difference to the floor if it's supposed to be paper. Hmm. I don't know.  Yeah, it should be crunkling up a little bit. Maybe. I'm not sure. It should be reflecting a little bit too. Hmm. Okay, I need to de-saturate this a little bit. Maybe even more and make this a bit brighter. Let me just export this before I index it to save some time. That looks a little more like rubbing paper. Hmm.      Somewhere overlapping different rotated sheets of paper. Yeah, I think it's the rotation that really would add stuff to this. I just made sheets this big right now, but I think if I also rotate them a little bit, that could be good. Windmills are still planned, yes. Hmm. We could also have the sheets of paper just be cut somewhere like so. So they don't actually go the whole way. Hmm. Mine is the Z-Fighting. I think this kind of works. It's a theme for this level. It's a craft level. It's made out of paper craft materials. Hmm. It would never smell like butter toast. Right. All right, let's take a look. Hmm. What the hell? Oh. Hmm. Probably this needs to have ignore collision. The fact that everything defaults to use culling. Goddamn. Hmm. It doesn't quite have the wrapping paper aesthetic for me yet.  This is the closest Nathaniel Bennu will get to a big house level from me. Now that I think about this. Hmm. Hmm. Let's reduce a little bit of overdraw. We could probably cut out everything in the end. Just the horizon line. I see what you mean now. We need to have something there. I mean, we're gonna have a lot more mountains, so that's gonna be something. Hmm. I also think I should refactor the floor to instead of being a bunch of quads. To be one level thing. Just to reduce all the overdraw. And the Z-Fighting there. Some little waves. I mean, this is canonically gift-wrapped now. I just have issues seeing this as gift-wrapped. It doesn't look that gift-wrapped to me. And that's a huge issue. Alright Julius, what's your idea? Brown pelts? Hmm. That could help. Oh, that looks terrible. Yeah, yeah. So this may be moving? Yep, that's Flint. A ball of brownish yarn. Brown yarn. Yarn could definitely work well. Not sure about a yarn ball, but maybe we can do something with that. Rotary cutter? I don't know what that is. Regular cutter? Don't know what that is. A tape measure? Ah, we got the ruler. Maybe there will be a tape measure that extends and retracts. Gaffer? Pep buns? Gaffer? What's that? Ah. Tape? Gaffer tape? Pep buns? Oh. Well, it's kind of similar to what we're already doing, yeah? If you look in the sky here, we already used a tape like that. I'm not seeking out to add BLJ spots. Either they happen or they don't. But I also don't seek to prevent them, so they probably happen a lot. There's invisible glue. I mean, there's glue here. This whole surface is glue. Mario's gonna be able to... Like don't jump here it's just gonna be like yeah yeah yeah but not a fan of the bottom i think the side is really good now the way this shines i like it oh you could be right maybe making the walls orange will make the whole sky look a lot better or the water i will try that okay never mind that's awful shit this in blue oh hmm that could kind of work how does an ocean sky usually look like i'm thinking we want something like this aesthetic right i could make this work though a more pastel orange i don't really know about this hmm hello i'm your cat i think if there are mountains all around the walls wouldn't blend into the water yeah i think that's also what we have to do just mountains all around orange until the bottom of my source of a blue sky we can definitely interpolate that but that's kind of ruining the aesthetic right because now it doesn't look like someone painted it anymore painting a transition like that is very difficult we really wanted what we could do is have um three separate stages but that looks awful too nevermind i want to add popsicle sticks to this level the problem with popsicle sticks is that they are very high poly money did i add um i need to add like an uneven number of them right so am i being stupid why can i not figure this out right now so dude i hate the new blender it's fucking awful it keeps having snapping on even when i don't want them uh actually i will have an easier time with this if i move this down 400 and then i crumple this a little bit as well like wait why why so it goes here and this one goes here this one goes here and here to make it not look as perfect i've been doing it all around so do I need a more papery looking texture and see what textures we're making nope I don't think there's one I think Arthur has one but I don't know if it's public I mean I will always present crafts like this yeah that's why I'm on purpose making this a little bit messy this kinda has a nice aesthetic to it what's the background made out of it's just paper that's drawn on that was my idea for this so this is not supposed to be final but I need this to have a proper look at what the heart of this level is gonna look like it's obviously this is too repetitive if we just put this out like this dude what the fuck how this this ZZ control L how is it only this is this whole thing like a separate layer how did just this part of the mountain become a separate layer oh it became part of this that's how just do it correctly true there we go these are actually so low poly I like it so it's gonna do this keyboard to your PC and it's doing random shortcuts and giggling when she hears you complain yes we're not copy pasting them I just need to do it right now to actually look at what the level will look like that is what I have sent before I did this I'm a little concerned with the condition oh actually never mind that makes sense that was an issue where too many collision notes were being generated which caused the collision rule to overflow that's what just happened when the game crashed alright so these parts are kind of nice but when you can see the thing below there it's kind of not nice okay some nice scissors maybe moving yeah we're gonna have scissors that go snip snip and attack you on your own rotary cutter i still don't know what that is let me google that rotary cutter not sure what this is gonna do a few times a ruler maybe as a trampoline we have a ruler as a trampoline right over here that's the plan a foldable meter stick maybe collection of stamps like male stamps i mean it could work yeah power tools portable hand drill okay well we want this to look finished at least somewhat right we want this to look like someone put this together and then was done with that's why i was opposed to having the stick of glue lying around here too what of wood glue cutting mat what is cutting mat oh i see an iconic ikea desk lamp isn't that what we have here it's very close to what we have lava lamp pen organizing box yes yes yes uh large rolls of paper that could work which was a fabling big sewing machine materials oh my god cardboard stacked carport osb what is osb oh i was thinking something like this with pins in it to platform on different types of wood simple galvanized steel hardware like l pieces or pipes different types of paper so rough drawing paper transferring a couple people sure sure squishy foam maybe it looks just yellow one squishy foam yeah this is also very cool and you have some cool ideas a lot of that is already planned in i think i need to make some more progress on this first before i can really look at that i have my mountains larger that won't fix the issue the issue is one the mountain stick in there and two the mountains don't hide the water on the sides if i can make a full mountain range i could probably just cut that right before it reaches the mountain and no one would ever find out so i think this is a go this is a fine so i'll just have to oh god what is this again so there we go i'll place them here for now and then in the end we're gonna cut this correctly so it looks fine we're gonna make the mountains a little bit bigger too so no the wages are sinking in the salsa well i'm gonna cut the salsa so it doesn't look like it's gonna sink in the salsa why don't you look up paling out to look for ideas because i'm not looking for ideas right now i'm trying to solve a problem yeah paper boat again we don't want the player to jump into here thinking they were gonna get somewhere a kid looking over the room again we don't want this to be like a kid's level i was thinking this could be made by anyone from any age but i don't think it's gonna be a kid's level that's why i was against the idea of toys too the one that was too high maybe that would be a very easy fix but i think they're fine we're just gonna count the water rebels at the end here and then there's gonna be the cardboard mountains all around and it's gonna look fine i consider the horizon problem solved same with um the walls i think it's all good we should draw some clouds on the skybox though also what i want to do is i want to put an inf pg that's just like a ceiling of a room around here maybe a wall so that it looks like you're actually just like stuck inside a room cotton cloth oh cotton clouds that sounds sick cotton clouds you can definitely do that do Wait, crayons aren't only for kids? Good thing it was in a semi-morganic state, less increasing legion's protection than the last one. No it's fine for small elements in the background, it's not fine for the whole floor. Are clouds are going to be small right the overdraw cost scales with the amount of pixels did  develop the Takeu Street Morris 64 I mean from what I've been told it sounds like the PS1 has the same texture memory size it's just that they have an easier time splitting the triangles and also a lot more cartridge space I imagine that's like the main reason you wanted to put like Final Fantasy 7 to N64 all the pre-rendered backgrounds is what would kill the project oh I had no idea that's really cool to know Electron DrLegZigZag are climbing around the cone sparring lab I wanna draw a bit no actually I haven't thought that part out yet right now I'm just gonna put some assets together and then I'm gonna figure out the shape ideally it would be interconnected without being too linear just pre-rendered backgrounds just like five polygon houses Final Fantasy 7 style there's an evil 264 oh you played the N64 part of the game I see honestly I never looked much into how the N64 was developed it was never really that important to me I only ever looked at what the outcome was and like how the game did the console works I only ever look at how it was developed so that when I make a video people don't get upset at me like okay you're being unfair they had to do that and that that's the only reason I ever look at that because whenever I say something that's slightly critical of a decision they made I get so many comments being like but case it was 1996 this is the smash bros texture so that's kind of fitting but this looks terrible never looked at the leak very luck I haven't actually I don't even know what that is I'm very much in my own lane I just make the games let's just look for room textures on model resource empty room interesting well the html was used to design the srg itself oh no never looked at anything like that I wanted to maybe make a video about all the hardware bugs on the n64 I feel like that could also be interesting because there's quite a few that I know of there's probably even some that I don't know of yet oh the giga league yeah I on purpose stayed away from the giga league as much as I could because I figured if I ever look at the giga league and do content with it they're gonna completely murder me because they are already murdering my youtube channel whenever I can this is kind of a terrible background for a room there's a bug with that what is that that's one bug I don't think I knew of although to be fair I have turned divot off in my game most of the time in the toad house that would actually work yeah is there a toad house here somewhere that I can take textures from now I'm gonna see if what's around the edges were often small extra things around the text hard to explain I know that happens on emulator but that happens on n64 too this is kind of nice I could take this texture but I think I'm better off using one of my special textures here this looks much like a toad house but it's too high res but we can just scale it down what vibe are you looking for for a cozy maybe wooden paneling like behind you on the webcam and no carpet could be expressed with drop ceiling panels or I'm just a normal house honestly I do like the aesthetic of it just being like a toad house so I'm thinking we're gonna do something like this with the wooden panels at the top and then for the ceiling I'm not sure yet like so and then some wooden panels here who gave me a 64 by 65 texture someone was messing with me there I saw the perfect texture here when I was looking earlier yes this yet dude this is also a blender bug why it's such a stupid bug that it keeps just resetting you even if it's adjacent yes that's bug and then do that in previous versions I will take no discussion on this point something kind of like that this will be an infinitely far away background with no z-buffer so we'll run that first and move it with the camera yes Rosie of course yeah I imagine when you're designing like a whole console you're gonna have to pull out some tricks to make sure it's all good and smooth so this way you're gonna look at that and it's gonna go black there and that's just the only thing you can see this side triangulation needs to be the same that's gonna look stupid that should do it it's music I just want a different texture on the ceiling what do ceilings usually look like what if we give him an ugly popcorn ceiling totally ceiling surely we'll find something here oh they have actual mushroom patterns on it cool cool I like that I don't think this is the move but I want to see what it looks like anyway it's actually not that bad honestly I don't really do much hardware stuff I only do programming like the most I do hardware stuff is just what I do assembly stuff obviously I am focusing entirely on n64 so just the idea of making a new hardware is not that interesting to me I guess it'd interesting to learn about how to do it maybe I can find some applications and what I'm I don't see it's not terrible I think I'm fine with importing this as a background but we've been streaming for a while almost three hours so I think I'm done for now and I will see you guys in the next maybe just this one change because I can save this triangle hey oh but I shouldn't I shouldn't save the triangle all right bye bye
