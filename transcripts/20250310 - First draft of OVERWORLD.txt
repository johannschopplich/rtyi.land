You you hello links longs Let me actually switch my sound to. Hello, Rick. I am the first you are not the first is like an early stream compared to recent ones. And daylight savings happened here in Canada. So it's actually late for me. But early compared to others. We need a way to get more coins in your world before we move on to the second part. And I like these to be easy to collect. Well, actually, I have a bad idea. I know that that's a little some waffle. No. I'd like to see the Biobak rework of the overworld. Yeah. Hello, phobia. Hand pink waving. You too, bro. And pink waving. There's one part that you think might be better than what would it be. Possibly, of course, for submissions. I think their design is a little not great. And in fact, we have already reworked all of them once to make them less bad, but they're still not perfect. I think this was a little unfortunate. But because far and true, this is a lot of variety, too. So I think there's value in having course for rounds in the sense that it creates contrast. You know, sometimes the part that people least like about the game are also the parts that are most necessary to make the game's design work. Anyone have any such examples? Come on, Rob. Finish converting the materials. And I guess in the meantime, I'll think about this. So my plan was to copy the reef textures and put them here in the floor and everywhere. So. So what I would really like is a way like a simple way to get up on this part here. I think that would add a lot to the old. Hello, Siren Runner. Also, and I will be seeing this multiple times throughout the stream today. I am now actively looking for beta testers for Drug Boss Mario. Rovard and Voicel already tested this yesterday a little bit. And I think it's in a state where it's actually like a really fun game to play right now. Hello, Voicel. Yeah. And about the guy who shot a guy saying someone murdered five kids on the floor. I have no idea what you're talking about. You think it's really fun and you have five hours in it? That's insane. I'm very glad to hear that. If you want to be a beta tester, please message me on this court. Send me a message request. Please understand that during the first beta testing, I'm only going to accept people that have been here for a long time because I want to minimize the chance of leaks. And as we get further into testing, I'm going to open it up so we can eventually probably release it. Drug Boss Mario 64 Daily Dialog Box. I can show what it is. It's a first person shooter. It's where you deal drugs and shoot people. It's this. Here's another track fresh out of the oven. And you can shoot the police if you want. It's a very different type of game. There's a whole stock market simulation in there as well. There's an actual stock market for illicit substances. And I'm looking for five testers to begin with. I already have three. So very limited slots. And this is also basically just like the second, the first wave. There's going to be more testing opened up at some point if more people want to test. These reefs are not going to be the final look of this level, right? Anyway, so today's stream is mostly going to be focused on the second part of the first overworld. And our goal for the first overworld is just to find a way to make more coins collectible without making it suck. Nice cant laps. Unfortunately, I have to say I'm not one for spoopy beta hacks. Never been into that. So I want the simpler way to get up there because I think it's kind of annoying that you have to walk for this. And I fear that some people that are here will not even understand what a wallkick is. Yeah, this is the first part of the overworld. And there is 15 parts in total. No, this is just 1 15th of the overworld. That's a good way we can make it go up there without sucking. If you just cut the boat half when you enter, it will just teleport you to the previous overworld, which is like the intro world. You know, like the castle from our galaxy where you walk towards the castle. We're going to have something like that very beginning of the game. Must experiment with walljumping. Yeah, it does. What if I just look at pictures of cliff sides and for inspiration? I hope they fix NVIDIA broadcast sometime. NVIDIA broadcast is like the worst software ever. Every time their stock plummets, they release a new version that's worse than the previous version. We could just have rocks you can walk up on. I think that wouldn't be so bad. If there were just like a circle of rocks here, then progressively we're softer. Also, today is a bonus stream. That means we're listening to whatever the fuck I feel like. And I feel like listening to this. I can't think of an instance where to play. Let's see. Pretty sure it's just a signpost. Yeah. You have three important jump techniques. The triple jump, then the walking, and then the long jump. It's just fucking exposition jump. Remember the trick in walking jump? Yeah, it does that too. And then there's another sign. So basically, there's just three signs to tell you to walk. Yeah, dude, this is actually the craziest thing. Many people don't know about Mario 64. But the way Mario 64 teaches you most of its movement is that if you go in the back of the castle, there's just a huge fucking exposition jump that tells you what to press. There's going to be jumpscares in a sec. If you do not poop your pants while playing this game, I will be disappointed. I want you to have a seizure playing this game, please. This is going to be the spoopiest tech yet. I'm just yapping garbage. This is not true. I don't know why I'm doing that. I should not be doing that. I should not be doing that. The wallkick is difficult. Especially like... I think it was especially rough back in the day because 3D platforms were completely new. No one had even fathomed this concept of a walljump before. Yeah, I will leave you. Yeah, that sounds about right. Surely, you did that. Sometimes I feel like I'm getting older and my brain doesn't work like it used to anymore. And then I also think that maybe my neurons just got more optimized and less variable. So now I'm bad at the things I want to be good at and the ones I practiced and worse at things that I didn't practice. And I think that is the truth. But when I feel stupid and then sometimes I look what other people do and it's like holy fuck what went wrong with everyone. I think that is the general thing that makes me feel like all people are just borderline at the point where they are unable to function in society. I think that's just the neurons being optimized to do the free things they do every day. Can you optimize it as the Kidama takeover? No, I will not be doing that. It's an emulator only hack. Unfortunately, I have to tell you to just get better hardware. Hello, tea time. Optimize neurons for Mario 64. I think my neurons are kind of optimized for Mario 64 and like the decision-making and game design in general. But sometimes like okay, I saw this thing today, which is like this is a trick question. You're at a casino and you roll a dice. Or you are a casino and there is a dice in front of you. The dice shows one. Now you're in a game where your mission is to make as much money as possible. You get a hundred rounds of play and in each round play you are allowed to either roll the dice or get as much money as it currently says on the dice, right? So it says a one you could get $1 a hundred times or you could like roll once and then get whatever the dice shot 99 times and each round you can decide. I was looking at the problem and I think I can solve this within like 10 minutes. You just kind of like do induction from the last number. But it took me too long to come up with that. That should have been so obvious. Took me like two or three minutes to figure out. And like my brain is not optimized for that anymore. I think back when I was studying mathematics in university that would have been like instantly like that's my answer. But that's like not a skill I need for Mario 64 hacking. I think I need to force myself to just spend all day solving difficult problems and not doing random shit. So I can re-optimize my endurance for that stuff. I hope I can do that gloop but for that I need to remove all the Mario references first. Okay, this section is cool as fuck. I like this section. This section is fun. I will move individual coins up here so that players will think to do that. Also shown. Hello boys to men. Can I give you my Mario Unreal Nanite engine? Why would you want Nanite? Come on. This is like the fifth bit, right? So we want 3, 0, 3, 8. I think 3, 0. Three coins on top of each other. When you start from scratch in a new engine to Salon Ocean game. Well, what you probably don't realize is that like almost all of this engine here is my engine at this point. The only really thing that's still left from the vanilla 64 is Mario's physics. A little bit of the sound engine like for example the way the coins are rendered is completely different the coins here there are no like 2d sprites that are being rendered in screen space they're not actually 3d models they're not even billboards or like um the way mario is rendered is also completely different the animations are going to be different because instead of oil angles it's going to be quaternions the data structure is going to be different the camera is 100% custom code really it's just mario mario's collision function are custom code they no longer use the original game's function the step function for mario's physics is also custom code only mario's actions themselves are not 100% custom code but like even walking is custom code now because um the original game when you're on the hill like this and you walk sideways it doesn't work right mario slows down by the hill slopeness it works right here i had to refactor walking for that swimming is completely different because i changed the controls so like even the water jump is different wait even the water jump is like a completely separate action but like this jump here that's still vanilla mario 64 or this jump here or when you triple jump that's vanilla mario 64 when you land that's not vanilla so there's a few things i need to change um mainly if i wanted this to be like legally sellable i would have to update the sound engine i would i'm actually working on reworking the operating system right now as well it's already like half my custom was but not fully but yeah i would have to change out mario and the sound engine doesn't like run on an sd game and then launch or something i feel like modding or something like that port 64 was based on the lip ultra operating system and i have my own operating system that is currently based on lip ultra partially but also partially my own and i'm going to remove all of lip ultra because lip ultra is dog shit unoptimized piece of shit code unfortunately so i think if we made the player collect 10 coins that would be perfect here or maybe i think i should remove that then yeah i should have a few sizes correct oh who didn't hear this is important so so what are the cons were to pay off pack either i do not like to make of course i literally just know i don't want to listen to this get me back my french car  okay cool come on fix it there we go since the game boss event has been considered will he show up elsewhere in the main story or just relegated to one appearance um he would have maybe one or two appearances in the overworld to like part of the story basically he's kind of sure then i'm using python as a wrapper for asm i don't know what means someone said they want to add time to mario 64 it makes me feel the love within me and i actually think that might be a banger idea because i think about using it as like an interpreter language like a scripting language like i compile it down to the minimum it can be and then you run an interpreter script to execute the entire code in instruction cache even though it's more complicated than that you could save a lot of data throughput and potentially improve performance at the cost of cpu but who cares about cpu cycles we have 94 million of them a second we need like 30 million of those at most so the second part of the overworld is going into the island you like python i think only really bad programmers care about which programming language they use for most applications if performance is sensitive then like yeah maybe you can't use python or like i mean like i just mentioned a use case where python is faster than fucking assembly yes actually that would do that's a banger tweet people would get so mad at me that's a perfect tweet i'm i'm tweeting that you you you you you you i think you can be faster than assembly because uh how do i how do i work this you know what i'll just say python can be fast and i go to the assembly i don't know how do i work this without it just being wrong candy bar i mean talking about a candy bar right okay we also need to think about the volcano that's going to be here i think i need to kind of make a part of this overworld just in visuals so it's game maker which like because i know what it's something very much a game maker is probably incredibly unoptimized but like it doesn't matter because it's 2d games right you have to be really shit at making your game to have a 2d game bar in the modern environment and i mean it does happen this is actually a theory i have i think 98% of games have at least one thing in them that costs like an unreasonable amount of performance and that's usually like the reason games lag so like they just have one stupid thing that costs like 10% of the whole game's budget performance-wise why don't we finish one area before moving on to the next um because when we work on the other areas we will likely have to adjust this one again so if we do that we waste a shit ton of that's why we don't do that hello sarah seems unfortunate well i think it's true i still want to have optimized code i'm just not gonna brag or bank gods yeah you're not gonna have optimized code if you use a premade engine that's just impossible about me now yeah no matter what you do all my skyboxes are custom-made 3d models i don't use the standard mario 64 skybox system this is actually another thing yes i entirely ripped out the mario 64 skybox system because it's hideous okay very imposing looking volcano i like it i might have to make the volcano part of the backgrounds because we might not be able to make it big enough what's your reddit post beta what did you post well it's if it takes 10% of the budget but should be taking 0.1% then yes that's a lot yes i want to store and later on to place current dimension using macros and r slash i see okay um part two is going to connect to part three now part two is just drawn in a squiggly line here i want this to be mostly like a platforming section with the entrance to course three to the first bowser level and to part six here no part five um one thing i'm thinking about is this might be bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside and for that reason i'm thinking maybe we should make part three first so that we have a good estimate of where it needs to connect i do not have a platforming layout in mind at all i think we should make part three first before we make part two but three is going to beach side with the ghost ship and zoo entrance yes this is just a rough layout this is not going to be like this it's going to be a lot more after this but part three is a little more interesting to make part three is this beach section here with a whole zoo entrance this is going to be the course four is going to be the ghost ship in the fog so you're just going to see a black outline in the fog and when you walk towards it you're just going to fade out and you're going to have to make your way through the overworld to the lighthouse and you go up the lighthouse and you turn the light and the light shines and the ghost and then the fog disappears and now you can enter the level so you do something later in the game to unlock something early in the game that's cool as fuck um for that reason i'm very much a fan of this overworld part the question is where do we draw the line along i think here would be the best something like um then we can go up for the ghost ship and then we can make the entrance for the zoo like along here and then connect the discs something like this shape here you get to the ice cap to get to the ice that was yes very good memory on your part that is something i had written down but i'm not sure we can really do that anymore unless we make it so that the player actually finds the ice cap before beating bozo one which i think we have to do it that way if we want that i'm a little worried that this overall part is small but i think we will be fine is any member randomly and these are some conversations you have to assist the romance um no it's a just kind of use your brain type situation i don't have any written guidelines are you going to be able to see the first part of the hub when you reach the lighthouse or such an escalator would be so cool yeah definitely definitely um we're not gonna make it able to do that for now but after Biobak's final rework we will probably do that foreign hey so it's gonna be kind of lame if we just have huge walls everywhere is it not hmm uh yeah that happens it's usually that geometry is overdrawing too much although i'm very good at estimating stuff like that so it doesn't usually happen and when i'm dubious about something i just test on console 700 that's 4 0 that's 2 8 so we need to increase this to like maybe 3 0 i think the world is big enough yes i'm a little worried that you can't really see the yoshi shape of the old in the end even if you think hard about it but honestly i'm fine with that   i wish there was a faster way to do this so i think all these mobs is going to be so annoying hello ayahuasca are you can germany men other german men this just aren't gonna thing um no you have to program that in sorry what just happened i missed it thank you for the 17 months of beatork hello timing master uh you joined with unremarkable timing unfortunately i have to say that um well having clips around everything is kind of lame i think i think we need to be a little more creative with it so actually you know what my convention will be um when it moves to when it walks through a thing it will be the four warp when it comes from a part that will be the free warp so i'm going to use three two and four two here so then you can i did uh i think i did honestly i'm not 100 sure um this was the thing where i wasn't the only one working on it so i was working on it too and basically the inspiration behind it someone paid me money to make it i don't use kidra so and basically at the moment you can assume that anytime i make a romhack that's not a complete mini hack that uses like my engine and has my style and it's not rty then it's not and then it's like a commission game the drug maury one is also commissioned someone paid me to make that there's a lot of money to me made in romhacking but this one here is not any paid work at all this is just me working because of passion so it needs to be free too but i need a free to warp here and i need a four to warp here at some point but not for now Actually I will still set it up. It needs to go to free. Then my 4 to warp here should just go to area 3 for now. It's a test warp. Now I should be able to enter that area. Now that's just gonna be for the overworld decor. I just needed a convention for the overworld to make doing this less painful. You know what I should do? I should just import a background here that's very simple. Biobak is going to rework all levels here. Let's import a simple background so that we can actually see our level correctly. Hmm. Shit. My user preset is gone. Oh well. Nope, it's not inspired by Diddy Kong Racing. Nice B-Turk. ZooZooZoo did get a rework already so that's why it's looking better. ZoooZooZoo did get a rework already so that's why it's looking better.

You have to ask him. Or her. I have no idea who she is. I knew Mushi as a guy for my entire life and then he changed his profile text to like Bulgarian Catboy and I'm not sure what that means anymore. SimpleFlips actually hosted a competition just like last month and he's going to play the hex three weeks ago so anytime now. I knew Mushi as a guy for my entire life and then he changed his profile text to like Bulgarian Catboy and I'm not sure what that means anymore. It was a close competition daily. It was like you had to make a team of three people and only a few teams got accepted. I knew Mushi as a guy for my entire life. It was a close competition daily. It was like you had to make a team of three people and only a few teams got accepted. I hate putting cliffs around here again. Let me give you a recap of what's going to be here. So up here is going to be the Fade-Out thing. Then here is going to be the Zoo around here, this whole area. And somewhere in here there's like an X marks the spot type puzzle where you have to find the spot. Someone's going to give you a puzzle on how to solve it. Now Mushi is a fun guy. Person. Cat boy. Yeah, for me the creative part is what takes the longest, I think. Especially now that we have C, like programming is free. Back in the day with the sampling, yeah, that was a lot more difficult. But now it's just like, yeah, just go and do the thing. Makes sense to have a cliff at least on one side of the arena. Yeah. The problem is it's so lame if everything's just cliffed up, right? I don't like if everything's just cliffed up. Is there other natural barriers we could use? Why did it open Subnautica? It's just a regular island. Not Yoshi's Island. We could put giant fruit that blocks your path. A tree line works, yeah. I'm just thinking about part 8 here. Part 8 is going to be castles. Castles? What do we have for castles? Northwest. Kind of a boza fight. Okay, so this wall here might just be like... How about it's like a giant fruit with some mountain behind it and on the mountain there's trees. We can't do pits. It's one cohesive island.  Thank you for the view count life ticker. Let's have one part of the island have ruins or build structures like dangerous barriers and walls and stuff to platform on. This part here is going to have destroyed castles. Because in Yoshi's Island you destroy the castles. So that is going to be a thing. But I'm thinking giant fruit here would be more fun. Because it is Yoshi's Island. And then to get along here to the next zone I wanted the player to use the ice cap. There is a pond plant with waterfall rapids. Let's see if we can find a quick banana. That's only the entrance for quest 4. The monkey bar banana is perfect honestly. Bananas make a nice barrier. Yeah, we're going to need forest as barriers. That's going to be in the cliff walk that goes through here. There's going to be that as well for sure. I'm actually thinking more about the area. I'm thinking... Something like this would be nicer. Or this is where you come out. That would have to be a texture daily. But that sounds like a very high poly thing. Oh, we can also have these Mario World penis hills, you know. That we had in the original overworld. I think these could work as well for something. I don't know. Do you call them that? What do you call them? I did not import it.  Ow, I had imported the empty owl. There we go.  I have not seen that. I mean, I've seen plenty of guys trying to make Zelda-esque games. But I've not seen the specific guy you're talking about. You put what in the concept? Bananas? That's good. That's good. Yeah, this banana one will definitely have to be completely different from this, but... It works for now. What song is this ending going to be called? No idea. You show me the things that are just out of sight. You whisper the words that will make me so... Banana flash. Flash. Everything. Everything. Everything. Well at least no one can say this is a volleying barrier. What the fuck? Well it's just going to be this for now. Who damned me? It can't be Azza. What the fuck? What the fuck? I have a message I guess. He would like to be a beta tester. Alright, I will investigate you later. Hello Tumbleweed, I am glad you like that. You should help Pixel Palavera. In this banner I could stand to be a little higher poly for the actual game. I like that you can climb the banner though, that's fun. Let's think about what our goal for this overworld part is. So, the first thing that's going to happen is you will see the ship here in the background, that you can't swim to, because it's all fogged up. I think I should probably reel these sides in a little bit. Otherwise it's going to make the boardwork a little difficult to work with. So in the original overworld we actually kind of already had something here. And it was this. And it looks very cool. And I'm thinking I will literally just copy paste this whole thing. Except for the fog setup, because that looked really bad. Yeah, there's a ghost ship level here. So it is going to be a little bit spooky. Spooky ghost ship next to the banana is kind of a stupid visual. I'm thinking maybe the banana couldn't reach quite so far. I don't like that the beach goes down like that. Who be DMing me? I'm here to show you the light. I'm just another one of them. But I've got guns and I'm on your side. You know what could be a fun contrast? Fog lifts and something like that. That's kind of silly in respect to what you realize. Unless the banana was there all along. Oh, were you thinking that much fog toward this area? Wait. I was thinking the fog was just going to be around here. The problem I have right now is actually that I don't really know how I'm going to make the fog work. I think this still looks very silly with the fog gun. It is a gameplay element to overcome to reach the other thing. Oh my god, this looks bad. Why does the ship look so bad? Does it always look like this? I guess it has. Wow. Model 3D ship. Well, we could just copy the ship. But we have a polygon, we can't touch it. I think it has to be further out to see. But I also don't want the player to walk towards this. Maybe this whole area around it is just the warp. But if you reach the area where the fog is there, you just kind of respawn. Bring the texture possible. Not at runtime. This might just have to be like four textures. Any obstacles in the way of that? Yeah, you need to reach the lighthouse first. So in the lighthouse there is probably going to be a small platforming section. But to get to the lighthouse you need to unlock the ice cap. And you need to go through part four. Bro fell asleep on the job. Yeah, what I'm thinking is there's a whole radius around the ship. And when you enter the radius before you have cleared the fog. Or before you have shined a light at it. You're just going to respawn. And if you do it afterwards, then you're going to reach the ship. So I actually kind of want the ship to look like this at first. With a huge fog around it. Yes, the fog will only be near the ship. Yeah, that looks pretty bad. I mean obviously we're not going to do this. But like, I wanted to see what it would look like.  Let me still brainstorm about this. Oh, nice Zeyna. Zeyna. That's going to be very difficult to do, Dainy Fox. Oh, this is what it looked like at full res, I see. Ah, yeah, so this is... Did you just make the ship for this render? Interesting. Just do the cloud thing you were doing. And have dynamic global fog. It would look sick. The problem is you can also just be here. And there's no fog here. Oh, you mentioned the respawn. You're just going to be washed ashore, I guess. Not sure what you mean by the cloud thing, Leena. What I had before was just like 10 planes that progressively got more opaque. And obviously that's terrible for performance. We can't do that. If you get close, it gets foggier. Yeah, what I'm definitely going to do is when you get close, it's just going to fade into like an actual white screen. That's just going to be a rectangle rendered over the whole screen. Oh, I see what you mean, Dainy Delphox. I see now, I see. I get your vision now. Having the fog clear up as soon as you beat the lighthouse. Yes. Oh, that sucks. So if you actually just set fog on this, and then we change the fog to turn off after you change the lighthouse. Okay. I like your idea. But there's still the issue that I want the fog to be harsher around the ship. And I need to think about how that will look like visually. Yeah. But the fog should still be there for the ship, right? The ship should be more visible. I was thinking when you open the lighthouse, what happens is instead of this, the ship is going to start looking like this. Or even like so. Or so. Just make more fog. Okay, that doesn't work. Yes, that's definitely going to happen, Dainy. But there's more to it than that. Okay, what if we used the camera angle to determine the fog intensity? What if while you're looking at the ship, the fog intensity in the whole area went up, and there's just fog around always? I think that would work. It's more like a technical question, Dainy, I think. More like technically, how we implement this. Isn't that my idea? That doesn't sound like your idea at all. You said some bullshit about clouds. It's not that the ship creates the fog, it's just that it's very difficult to make volumetric looking fog on the N64. The only downside to that is that I need to add fog to every single thing in this area. Fog increasing as you get closer to the ship. Of course it does that. That was already predetermined. The question is how we make that look. Or how we make that work technically. Of course the fog increases when you get closer to the ship, otherwise how are we going to fade the layout? How it's going to work is, here's the full idea. You enter this area, and when you look at the ship, there's going to be very strong fog in this area. When you look at the way from the ship, there's going to be slight fog. When you get really close to the ship, and the ship is a larger percentage of your screen, the fog gets more dense, and now you almost can't see anymore. When you get within the warp range of the ship, your screen is going to fade to white, and you're going to be washed ashore. Unless you have the lighters activated. When you have the lighters activated, then there's no fog in this area. Unless you look at the ship, then there will be very slight fog. And the ship will now be visible. Maybe sometimes you have good ideas, and you just don't communicate them correctly. Which would be tragic. You should work on that. I'm going too far. If I see her again, promise I won't cry. Anyhow, as you take a look at how the fog works, you may get a sphere texture for the Mario, but that sounds sloppy. That would be very sloppy. You would have a harsh cut where the sphere is. That would look very, very bad. I'm going too far. I'm going too far. It's a night, you always know where to go When it's been a child's game of don't mind Wherever we are we'll be fine We'll keep you warm and calm It's a December night, December night You know what I like Do it once, do it twice Need a little fun December night, December night December night, December night December night, December night    Deeper than canyons and oceans Brighter than powerful spins Your name is written in blood on my heart You call and I am confessed Intertwining bodies making heat in the night The night Fizzing, binding, we're moving to earthly delight Delight Intertwining the night Delight  Delight Intertwining the night  Intertwining the night Delight Intertwining the night I let this be but the ancient A song of a forgotten truth We are preserving our ancestors' call As I sink my teeth in it Intertwining bodies making heat in the night The night Fizzing, binding, we're moving to earthly delight Delight Intertwining the night Intertwining the night Intertwining the night Intertwining the night Intertwining the night Intertwining the night A breathless whisper tells me it's alright And I belong to you under the moonlight So I face this thing alone, see where my body goes Bleeding to places no one knows Cause I don't belong to serendipity Don't need to grapple with your deity No, cause every kingdom will soon be overthrown I don't belong to serendipity, no Intertwining the night Cause I don't belong to serendipity Don't need to grapple with your deity No, cause every kingdom will soon be overthrown I don't belong to serendipity, no I don't belong to serendipity, no Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Intertwining the night  Hello, hello? Hello? Hello? Okay, so what happened is NVIDIA Broadcast, the program I have open here right now, broke mid-stream And then I tried to change off from NVIDIA Broadcast, and trying to change off from NVIDIA Broadcast crashed OBS, because as soon as I entangle the OBS UI, it crashes Why are there so many dogshit programmers working on all this software? Only one year?! Oh my god, dude, are you kidding me? How about this, I changed it to mono So you didn't even hear me complain about the fog setting not working? Leela, you still here? You can't set the fog to over 1000 And because of that, I can't preview my fog In order, what should be next if you finish doing overworld? Site levels Okay, I'm just gonna disable fog preview, because it doesn't work Disabling fog preview doesn't work Okay, that's 2 bucks to report Disabling fog preview does not disable fog preview Let me just take a screenshot And... You can't set fog preview beyond 1000 fog minutes Cool So this is just what we're gonna have to live with There's nothing I can do about it How did no one tell me that my microphone wasn't working for so long? We didn't see your lips move? Oh, I guess Yeah, that's kinda what I did, right? I kinda just make mini-eggs usually I just thought you were in the zone You like the stream better without me talking? Insane My own stream hates me It's so funny that I have multiple meshes like this I've discussed things I've shared, it's fun Yeah, I think that's better than just working on stuff Getting immediate feedback is pretty useful Okay, I think I'm done Ooh, we don't have matte bleeding on We have matte bleeding on Oh, not in this one We don't have matte bleeding on in course 9 Okay, let's see Just watch and learn, you will figure it out No need to get your pants in a twist Oh boy So we're just gonna make it so that this is an alpha So f72 alpha equals 0.1 f And let's say define heavy fork We wanna set this to 971 Light fork, we wanna set this to like 1060 Hey, 1050 So Let's see, how does this work? Min, max Oh, these are weird fucking values, what the fuck Okay, I ain't dealing with that I'm just gonna, it's going to be slightly less efficient But it is what it is So So there's no animation, it just naturally does that Oh right, cause now I no longer have Nvidia Broadcast, you can hear my furnace Manual effects, there will definitely be a light thing Okay Let's see, how far away are you from the ship at that point? 4000 coordinates, okay Does this make sense? Does this make sense? Um, um, um, um, um Not really Wait Yes, yes, yes, okay Okay Um, no, actually The less distance, the more fuck I want So at 4000 distance, this is zero Ugh, why does it have to be such a weird propagation? This is when my brain, my brain is slowly freezing That's true with Daily Doll Folks, there could be like Blue, uh, purple, not, not blue, blue, green swirls I still want to give this whole game a VFX pass, so I would do stuff like that then When I'm doing all the VFX I want CG access, it's an older game I remade, I'm playing right now, I have no idea what the fuck to do It's literally just Castle Grounds is extended with a little bit of extra stuff Okay, alpha 1 means we have the heaviest fog, right? Okay  Okay Why am I struggling with this?  At 5000 distance, we want this value to be 1 So right now it would be 1, at 0 distance it's still 1 At 10000 distance, or at 8000 distance it's 0.5 Okay So this is, this is good, this is what it should be, good Okay The jaw and the angle to this from the camera So Okay Um, this one might be wrong Because new cam jaw, if I remember correctly, is inverted So we're going to print this I don't know if I've seen something on this. Let's see what happens. No fog at all, none. Ah, yep, the angle is inverted. Is it not? Why does the angle difference always so large? What? Oh. The angle to cam is... okay, makes sense. That should do something, the naivety on reddit or not. What? I have no idea what that means. It's doing something. Not what I want it to do, but it's doing something. I have never seen this inverted fog. That's a thing that can... what the fuck? This is a crazy effect. I think this might be just an issue in the macro. True, kaizo hackers love abysmal dog shit. What? This is not declared a misfunction in this file? That's crazy. Oh, 300% shading, that'll do it. Right, I didn't do this right at all. Let's do something like this. Let's build in 0 and 0x4000. That's not even what I want. Okay. Okay. Let's just try it. Okay. Did I put this in the wrong position or something? How is this such an issue? This should be a simple thing. What the fuck? We definitely don't need to just set home. Did I export it since I moved it here? The fog is supposed to be gone when you look away from the ship. Or mostly gone. It's still there, it's just weak. Okay. Okay. Right, at 0 off I want this maxed. So... This is going to be long. You know what, I'm just going to invert this. It sucks that it's this way around. Oh my god, that makes it so much more hard to think about it. Okay. Now at 4000 it's 0, at 8000 it's 1. Good. Okay. Okay. Okay.  And I think this one might be inverted, because Nukenja is weird. Okay. We're at 0 and 0x800. Okay, so 0. Let me just undo this, this is a fuckery to go through. Okay. And no difference, we have no fog now, right? Or we have 0 alpha, which will be the heavy fog, which is what we want. And more difference than that we have something larger than 1, which will bug the fuck out. So we need min 1.f and we need this. And we need this. No, this will be a negative number. The larger the difference, the smaller the number should be. So it should be inverted here. Right, so at 0 it's 0, at 2000 it's 0. And then at 4096 it's also 0, but at 8192 it goes down to 4096, which currently becomes 1. And I think this is what we actually want. What is your goal here? We're working on a fog effect for Course 2, for Course 4's entrance. Basically we want there to be no fog when you're far away from it, like this. And then as you get closer to it and look at it, we want the fog to get stronger. Kind of like so. But it doesn't really quite work, right? I'm looking away, it's the opposite of what it's supposed to do right now. So we can just do 1.f minus this, no problem. There's still an issue though of the fog coming too close, so let's just try 975 I guess. Or, well actually, maybe if the fog comes too close we should also move the alpha plane out. I think these just need to be added together, right? Actually, maybe this was the plan after all. So we also need far, near... Sorry, this is also wrong. I think now we have what we want. Except I'm missing a semicolon here. It's not harder to create content on the PC, but it's just pointless. Why would you want to work on a PC port? What do you hope to gain from that? Name one advantage. I have not heard anyone name an advantage of working on a PC port yet that is actually a genuine advantage. That they actually use the PC port for performance. I don't think the PC port performs better. I was just being really stupid there, you know folks. It works now. I'm spreading it out in public. It's not easier to use emulators. Well, maybe not, but they're a lot more versatile and they run on everything. I think the distance fade, I don't like it. The ship looks foggier from far over here than it does from being near. All the courses have completely different themes, Johnny knows. That does look weird. But we're still adjusting these numbers here. I think the reason it looks weird is that the water here is not subdivided. I'll just do that for a second. I'll just do that for a second. Unity or whatever. Why would you want to use the PC port? Seems like a terrible idea. I think you need to be able to get closer than that. Actually, this should be a separate variable. Fork, love, beast. That would be even easier if you used Unreal Engine. It would just be there, right? Just press a button and you got it. Yeah, I think this is starting to look decent. Although, I feel like the ship doesn't look foggy enough from here. Is it just me or do you guys feel the same way? About the ship not being foggy enough from here. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. The skybox is definitely also an issue, I agree. I don't know. Hmm, I think we need a second method of fog. Something that's just consistently always there around the ship. It's a very light fog, daily fogs. That's why. It would be trivial to increase it though, I could do something like this, 10-20. Why is the angle distance so minimal? Something's wrong here. Let me just set that to something small and see what happens. Yeah, what the fuck? Oh, wait, I used this one here. That's why. Bouncy flower is just the overworld flower, it's not an optimization, it's just what it is. There we go, that's what we wanted. What if I set this, wait, what if we do this? I wanna just see how this looks, I imagine this will look very weird. Yeah sorry, we're obviously gonna change that. But we will see. Instant white. Isn't that just a quad that fades in? Let's see. Desert Colossus. This one. And that looks like a screen space effect that's in front of it. And no fork here. The problem is that this is over your entire screen, right? So that's like it doesn't address what we want to do. Of course, it looks good, but it's over the entire screen. Our entire issue, 100% of our issue is that we want the fork to be around the ship. That's entirely the problem. Let's transfer the scrolling screen space text. That doesn't really change anything. It is already fading in by the distance to the ship. It's crazy how it's going from like nothing to almost fully there like instantly. Dang. This is because fork is not linear. So like the curve for this fork. So that's just double square roots. I need to square it. Okay, that's a much smoother transition. We can combine that with the screen space texture. I think this is a good transition now. We just need some additional fork around here. And then I think this works kinda. And of course, we need something behind the ship to also have the fork. I do read the YouTube chat, yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. Okay. Okay.  Scene from this angle here. I'll call this fake fork. I'll call this fake fork too. Hello, links. Yes, I'm still talking. Okay. I hate that it's on the same file. One, two, three, four, five. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I have to name blend objects if I have to use them in game. Yeah, my microphone's not working, guys. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  I don't think that we can do it at all. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm not. Can turn this up to 10,000, I think. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So if you go any closer, you're just going to fade out. Like as soon as you jump off here, you're going to fade out. And you're gonna. Land here. And it's like, yeah, you kind of drowned. Okay. So let's, let's see. We're also going to make a decal Mario. Then we can render above Mario with any material. The idea of that is to do special VFX, like Mario being dumped in oil or whatever. And we can use the decal Mario here and feed them in transparency wise so that Mario is also fully white here. So at this point, almost the entire screen would be fully white. Now, what I don't like about this is that when you turn around here, the focus just fully gone. She's super from Hunter, Hunter. That's the spider goth girl. Hunter, Hunter is very cool, but I wouldn't call her my waifu. It's not odd. I know why it happens. I think we'll need something like that. This is just a bullshit formula. There's no mathematical basis for this or whatever. It's a big boost cruise. I don't know why. So there's just no anime waifu that I can pick. No one really stands out to me like that. That's not what I expected. This would look like. You are too young for this conversation. I see what you enjoy, though. Hello, Tanya. This guy was changed as well. Possibly. Okay, I think that's good. What's wrong? What do you want me to change? Please be more specific. Or are you just leaving out? Oh, I see. You're just leaving out. Can't say fog. I can't say fog. What now, huh? I can't pronounce the G at the end of a word. Trust me. I've done it plenty of times. All right, so we'll need more fruits around the outside of this area. But to be honest, I'm feeling a little burned out at this point. I've been going for a while. And it is technically my day off. So I will see you guys next stream. Hopefully I can stream again on Tuesday. Until then. Bye bye.
