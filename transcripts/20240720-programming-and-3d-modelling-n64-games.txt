Hello? Hello, Biobak, 7pm on the dot. My goth, false. So, we have a new profiler. Or well, not a profiler, it's a trace and a profiler at once. Yo, hello Zeina, hello Beta, hello Paper Kitty. Am I a profiler? True. Anything planned tonight because I'm the new oily boily boys? Um, nothing in particular, just doing this. Can I tell you a funny story, please? I could, probably. I could come up with one if I thought long and hard. Hello Sonic the Hedgehog, thank you for the 11. Yeah, so this is the new profiler. It is pretty good. I'm gonna show this to Sauraen real quick, just so he knows. Ream animations are back. You like all the colors and shit? Dude, they are really useful. Let me, okay, let me limit the FPS so we get something more consistent so you can see how ridiculous this is. All right, you see? Funny thing about RTYI, 25 out of 33 milliseconds are spent on a while 1 loop. It's all idle. It's around 76% of the entire game, it's just the game doing nothing at all. Then right here we have the RSP task. It's just running for a little bit and then the audio task is running again. This is all good. We got the VI manager running here and here. The VI manager gets interrupted by audio sometimes, that's funny. We got the idle thread running basically the entire frame. Not sure what's happening here at the end. Maybe it's just, oh, because of game loop. Game loop runs at the end of the frame, that's very interesting. I did not think that that would be the case. Extremely weird too. Hello, Lilaa. Yes, the Sauraen profiler. Did you import a custom font for this? This is a font called small font and I'm not sure where it's from. Okay, we got one more F3 trailer I might have to add here, oops. Should run before. Well, the game loop is definitely higher priority than idle. I guess the game loop is blocked by something. I'm guessing the game loop is blocked by, I'm not sure, actually. This is, well, sound would definitely be blocking it and scheduler, but from here to here, nothing would be blocking it. So I'm guessing there is an RSP done signal missing here. That must be it. Hello, McBanners. You missed your visit, you mentioned last week. Are you going to die now? Hi, Keisel, it's just been a year and a half since I made a video on making Minecraft run better this morning. What a cool stream. Welcome to the stream. Wait, my YouTube chat is once again fucking up. I don't know what to do about this. I'm very sorry to every YouTube viewer I have ignored so far. Hello, YouTube. Hello, Wimps. Hello, Kitsunu. Hello, Will. Hello, AveragePenis. Hello, Cindy. Hello, Spaghetto. And hello, Kyrios. Hi, I'm watching Debugging Optimization. This is a new profiler that Sauraen made that I just finished working on. So after this, we're likely going to work on Biobak's Oily Boily Bay assets. And now I'm just looking at this because, okay, this thing is actually like amazing. You guys have no idea how useful this is. The crazy thing is the RDP runs just a little bit longer than the GFX right now, which shouldn't be the case if everything went well. But I guess it is the case and that's not good. It means we're RSP bottlenecked. The chat was supposed to be there two days ago, but it just didn't drop. MarioFrost, that's intentional. I'm surprised the scheduler runs for this long. That's way too much for a scheduler to run. Same with the VI manager and the inactive render thread. The render thread is not running while you are limiting the FPS. If I unlimit the FPS, all these spas should go pretty crazy. Yeah, because now we're just going cowabunga and just fucking run the whole thing through. Crazy, the render thread is up to like 5.3 now. But it makes sense. Hello, that. Yes, this is console footage. Basically, I'm looking at the profiler. It's because I'm not BuzzFeed. You better get my... Oh, shit. Okay. One second. We have a small tangent of doing a quiz that Biobak requested. Color Rush. One second. We have to go on this tangent. And then we go back to developing. Which one are we doing, Biobak? Guess five colors at a time or... Okay, we do the 22nd one. What is this color? God damn. That's E210B0. Fuck. That's a difficult one. This is very desaturated and dark. I'm thinking something like this. I was pretty off. This is a dark pink. Pretty close with blue. It's slightly desaturated. Definitely not in twos. This is green. For sure. But how green is it? It's also slightly blue. Desaturated yellow, but also not very bright. I'm not sure if it's more red or more green. E0. Fuck, there's a time limit? I think I did pretty well. What do you guys think? 80.8% overall accuracy. Bro, how? I've never done this before. This is actually a good result. Just a little too dark on most of them. That's true. Oh, this one was much too dark. Yeah, it might be because my monitor is so bright. Just build in. Oh god, my whole PC is lagging. Either way, let's take a look at Chris13. Does everyone tend to go way darker colors than needed? If that's the case, maybe it's a website issue. It might be that they are gamma corrected. Improperly. Yeah. I need to disable the profile or I can't see my game. I need to disable the profile or I can't see my game. Dude, this profile really makes you feel like you're just in the matrix. It's a beautiful thing. 9x high brightness when it's barely above half. Base 10 problems? Well, I clearly don't have base 10 problems. Still, okay. You guys have not seen a lot of the work on this. Let me just show you what I was doing here. Oh, you can't go back this way? Cool. Let me just go to the bottom of this and then I'll show you what the idea here is. So this is a cave of the main level here. I'm actually going to build one.  The entrance is here. And the idea is that this is the snowman path. And this is the snowman cave. So you have to dodge all the snowman attacks. I kind of wanted this to work like that section in Jolly Roger Bay. Goddamn, can I just play the game please? You know where you climb the ship. I swear I'm not bad at video games. There we go. This is course 13. So it being a little difficult is fine. But that felt a little too difficult. And we got a little cliffside here. Of course we still need to texture it. Do not comment about the lack of textures. And then after that I got this slide over an abyss. So I'm thinking a little bit of a helix here. And then right here I want there to be an ice block here that you can jump on. And you're going to slide on the ice block. And you're going to jump off the ice block to land on here. Of course you can shortcut. Shortcutting is part of the fun. And then right here you start a little wallkick section. I think that part's really fun. And yeah, this will be the end of the slide section. It would be easier if you had more time to see the balls coming. That's true. I think the slide is decent. But there's a few parts about the slides I don't like. And that is how spiky it is. Because of how spiky it is it makes it a bit difficult to actually slide forwards. You might accidentally slide downwards. You guys have no idea how much trouble making this slide gave me. When I first made this slide I ran out of memory. And because of that I did the whole memory allocation thing that I talked about earlier in my Case Clips video today. And because of that we gained 400 microseconds of computing time. So yeah, we should do something about this element section being too difficult. I'm thinking we can be really cheap here and just kind of scale the slide down to half so that the horizon of the camera is higher. Or... Where is this? Or we can just make the camera tilt to be upwards on purpose at the beginning. But I don't really like that. You ran out of memory? Yes. That's because... Okay, the thing about Mario 64 is that every time you have a collision triangle that crosses into multiple cells and there are 64 cells each way you have to allocate two surface nodes. And because the slide was so big I had to allocate so many surface nodes that the whole thing just crashed. Have the changes you made affect precise angle jumps in any way? Okay, now I can read it. Have the changes you made affect precise angle jumps in any way? Like, for example, the newly discovered strat for carpetless? Yes. In Mario 64 you have 4096 angles. In this game you have 65336 angles. The controls are about 8 times more precise. As in, you get the direction you press with like 8 times more accuracy than on a default Nintendo 64 controller. Or default Mario 64 ROM. Meaning... If you use the exact same setup it likely won't work the exact same way. Because you're actually going the way you're pressing. Or you're actually getting closer to the way you're pressing. Okay, considering I don't like changing the camera tilt, what if we just make the slide like, half a side? Okay, so my message. Hot oily boily boys in your inbox. Alright, we'll switch to the oily boily boys in a second. Right after I'm done with this. ....  Just gonna make the storm empathy a little easier Come on select the start there we go Yeah, the thing is to save time on The arctans function and the sine and cosine function. I had to switch to a polynomial and this polynomial was more Accurate than the lookup table the bar 64 uses so I didn't really do it for the accuracy I did it for the speed but it increased the accuracy a lot as well Okay, I think this is a lot easier now right you can actually see them like early now Oh my god, this thing is guarding me I Don't like how this looks but of course, we're not actually gonna go with the wooden thing here. Yeah, that's good. I think All right, let's switch to what the Biobak sent me here oh My god, that is so many assets, holy fuck If you're deeping that means our team is near completion and which course are you at I'm on course 13 Hello Nintendo life You All right, we got an asset change luck here Let's go from top to bottom. Wait, I can't read my chat if I do that. Will the ice cap or any other special can be used in quest 13? The ice cap, yes. The other ones, I'm not sure yet. Who is bro and why is he flabbergasted? Interesting, I like the new textures. Harsh cut here, that should be fine. Let me just make sure all the materials are good. We should add fog to this, but that's... Interesting, what's the issue with that, Nilo? Did you do that? Hello, Hankahonka, you're minty today. I don't know, Hankahonka doesn't feel like a minty name to me. Let me just enable the fog preview. Okay, I think these are gonna look a lot better with fog. By the way, do some of you also have fog even with fog arena mode and fog preview disabled? That's a fast 64 bug. Did you change the condition map at all or... Actually, it doesn't matter. Too many unique colors. I don't think RGBA is any worse here in this scenario. Actually, I think RGBA is faster here, so let's switch to that. Let's make sure this looks fine. Goal new design and one fewer material. That is the notes that Biobak left us, which is very good because fewer materials is good. It's technically not a bug that the whole thing just shows up entirely white, no matter where you look at it from. Are you stupid? Oh yeah, the tox boxes fit so much better now. Oh, that's nice. The fog on it makes a lot of difference and these are cheaper to render too. I don't like that it's so easy to clip through them now. That's for sure an issue. That must be because of the new step function. I'm going to send a baby. Thank you, Larcer, Raijin. But it's not here yet. The rolling jumps a little at the end. You need to already clip into them before. Yes, yes, you're right. I know it's not your fault. Does it jump at the end? Oh, it does. All right, let's fix that. Thank you, Foxter. Dude, I'm still on two months of paternity leave. I'm gonna spend that time trying to optimize the operating system on my N64. This is maybe need to be 16. Take care of the newborn, baby. Is this paternity leave, not optimization leave? Well, what the fuck do you want me to do with my free time? Oh, what the fuck? Okay, this needs to stay 15. Baby related activities. I guess we can do some of that. Why does it jump? Fuck. You missed your appointment to the woke doctor? So what happens now? I mean, you are a child. You are not 18 yet. That seems appropriate to me. Could it be that the post jumps? Dude, when I was a little child, I thought there was a conspiracy that you grew up. I thought it wasn't real. I thought people just pretended. And then it turns out you actually do grow up. No one could have predicted this. So. I'll be honest, I have no idea what the fuck is going on here. So. Fellas, there's one thing I need to talk to you guys about. And that is the hawk to a girl. What the fuck? Why is that person famous? Why did anyone think that was funny? That's like one of those memes where there's no potential for variation on it. It's just a terrible meme. How did that become popular? And now she has her own TV show. What is going on with the normies? Why are they doing this? So. Yes, some woman spit on a microphone and now she's famous. It wasn't one of those TikTok street interviews where you go up to drunk looking women and try to get them to say something stupid. Cash me outside all over again. Yeah, actually, yes. Sometimes this for a long time, it's the I didn't do it. Simpsons episode all over again. Yeah, actually, yes, yes. That's that's a good analogy. And that I didn't do it. Simpsons episode is fucking ages old. Unfortunately, Pie, you have to be a trashy looking girl to do this. As that's the pattern I am recognizing so far from the cash me outside girl and the hawk tour girl. I'm not reading only Twitch stick figures. OK, you know what? I don't know what this is. I think we might be fucked unless. Oh, wait, that's the angle. Well, the fuck. The pulse is fine. What if additionally we set the velocity here? Oh, I don't think we do that. We should. This might help with the clipping. But not at all. What is actually the issue that I wanted me to fix? Command prompts both the hawk tour and cash me outside girls, since they're managing quite well. Oh, yeah, I can't hate on them. They're just doing the best out of their situation. I'm hating on like everyone who perpetuates this. Wamp and builder. Let me just move this over here. Made both legs use the same bone, saves one bone. Baked helmet strap into the texture saves one material. Slightly updated geo and collision to match. OK. Yeah, all good points. Dang, I think we can get oily, boily bay at 30 FPS now. Where's my animation mode? What the fuck? I should have opened this without opening the scene settings. Oh, my God. Yeah, let's try this again. It's like 10 fewer bones total across all of the wamps. Yeah, that helps a lot. There we go. OK. That still works. That still works. That still works. Oh, this is awesome. And we have little straps here. Oh, this is really cool. Oh, too many colors for CI. Which one was it? 0, 0, 1. OK, well, this can easily just fit into an RGBA 16. That's fast. 64 auto pick CI for your Biobak case can give me alcohol. I am physically capable of doing this.          I feel like that was pretty obvious. OK, one build and one build have fallen. So we got this and we got one build have fallen. OK. One thing that I might not have done well here is headfuck to this. Does vitamin D make you sleepy or does getting vitamin D from sun make you sleepy? You didn't check detector types, so fast. 64 automatically picked the wrong one. It's a sleepy EP. EP is princess. Prince Lilaa. Yeah. All right. Where did my tox boxes go? What the fuck? What have I done? I just saw a weird flicker and then they were gone. OK. So these are fuck. I think they have slight fuck, but that's a bug. Boxes put in it. OK, I got to figure out what's wrong with the boxes, though. That's concerning. Oh, probably this. I guess it's not good then. All right. Noted. But yeah, I should make these have proper fuck. OK. Not sure if I understand the purpose of this combiner here. And I'm thinking I probably am the one that made this combiner here. I guess we'll just do this. It should be fine. We don't need the shade of a thing here. I think like, sure, it would look better, but I think the fuck is going to be looking better than that. I don't say that, Cheryl. I really like your slope. It's bumpy and that's nice, but I think the camera is bumpy as well. It might be. Yeah. Yeah. You might have a good point. Maybe I should make the camera have an exception to bumpy slopes like that. The Maseriki Harbour layout vibes with the construction junkyard aesthetic. Yeah, that's kind of what it is. It's asking me questions on medicine. Oh, that looks so good the way the focus on them now. Oh, I like this a lot. Look at that. Oh, that's so much better. They really fit in the world now. Oh, that's nice. Fucking nice.   Dude, the Rambus goes vroom vroom thing is not even a tagline. You know what happened in that video? I was writing the video and as I was writing the video, I noticed I kept saying this optimizes memory throughput and I just got sick of it. You know, I was in a state of just being fucking I don't care. So I just wrote Rambus goes vroom vroom into my notes over and over because I just didn't care and then people loved it. You can break it, Carco. Because I knew I had to explain it over and over because otherwise people wouldn't like the video. So I just kept saying Rambus goes vroom vroom in my notes. Wump Tower. Oh, you added hands and feet. That is so funny. Dude, I have a video editor now, I think, and he's making the next video and it's looking clean. I'd love to show you guys just like a snippet, but eh. That block of stairs, Chris, what is that? That's the new building they're making. Clearly. Let's make sure this works as well. Hello, Pablo Capo. You should add shading, by the way. There's shading. How did you make those womps like those dominoes? Programming oh that's nice i really like the real sunlight here any name for the child the child's gonna be called reyna you know how they called mario's rival vario we're thinking that and then i'm gonna have reyna and Zeina fight to the death soap very hd it's gonna make sure this one works too actually does this need fog this is half fog what the fuck is this oh okay let's see so i thought i messed up here and gave it like a really weird combiner but no this is all on purpose Zeina please don't fight your daughter i told her not to but then she told me that some wild animals do that too and that she wants to live as nature intended do you guys think it would actually be that difficult to become a doctor or would it just be really really exhausting like do you think there's only a small percentage of the population that actually are capable of becoming doctors you never said that no way would i lie on stream doctrine philosophy i don't know please don't put pressure on your daughter to become a doctor of course not there's really only one thing you need to learn to become a doctor and that is uh you need to learn the sentence your pain isn't real and if it is just take some tylenol and if it's still not fixed come back and we'll send you to someone else can i get it true in chat hmm that's what doctors do to me glass slash broken glass update detectors all right let's see what we got when we take the soap and run straight into the cannon thwomp oh fuck i feel like i know exactly what's gonna happen come to american day one and optimize every technology dude have you ever seen german technology we're still stuck in 1980 if you don't have a fax machine good luck in germany you're not gonna make it email what is that okay i don't see an issue Biobak that worked just fine he rotates oh maybe i added this after i gave you the thing but yes he looks at you now and he says the cannon is closed okay we got a new glass texture i should add fog to this as well this should do it we set it to layer five oh god this does not do it um take zero by primitive fine so oh i see could be what was the memory optimization earlier i feel like the video explains it pretty well if you have any more specific questions you'll need to ask that one i feel like this glass plate is a little too transparent you know i think that's because blender usually typically renders something a little more transparent than it actually will be so let's just crank that up maybe pablo you left us in oh i see i see this is a different texture altogether that's pretty cool if you ask me so is this two separate textures interesting so they are really skilled in de-industrializing i heard that they want to introduce the wealth tax in germany where it's like one percent of all the money you own you have to pay it to the government every year i was gonna want to stay that's fair Biobak that is very true actually so yes some wealth tax and then you have those wood planks in the ice you didn't like what if they were bones of giant creatures in the ice sticking out it could be something like that i haven't really thought about it that much yet we'll figure it out should have left this shit all a long time ago yeah living in germany sucks i'm so glad i moved out  interesting i think that looked pretty good that might be true rhinofinger and maybe that would make sense but i feel like that's looking at it wrong because like i mentioned if you were actually wealthy you would definitely be moving away then and that would reduce the total tax income in that country wouldn't it so yeah i'm just thinking the min opacity might need a little bit higher so maybe there should be like a little bit of an additive part to it it does look a bit weird if you don't punch in the center this is true because if you compare it this has all the pixels have like a minimum value so i think that's a little bit weird but yeah i think that's a little bit of a problem yeah this is the thing like sure tax the rich like clearly that's good the problem is if you tax them too much they're gonna move away and you're not gonna have any rich to tax anymore and now you have less money it's a problem you need to do this unified across all countries if you want any success with that but it's supposed to be a part of the castle you know i always think a lot about well-being does it work as a part of the area does it serve its purpose yeah basically there's going to be a hole in the castle that leads to the cave sure but someone who makes like a thousand times as much paying 30% still paying for like a thousand people right i mean europe is doing that pretty much but you know i can still flee to canada so what if we do one more limit x alpha plus trim color alpha and then we set prim color alpha to like something low i think that's the correct way of doing it do the americas really accept no they don't it's really difficult to emigrate like that i like in canada in comparison germany is way better everyone in germany especially like if you have to call customer support for anything ever especially if it's anything legal they are all a piece of shit it's the worst they talk to you hate you you know that meme of like wait wait wait this this is every customer support in germany ever even if you're being friendly and have a and germany technologically is still so far behind like it's actually impossible to live in germany all right looks good you still haven't uploaded the ice castle music that's true well i haven't gotten very far with the ice castle yet so give me some time wiggler worker that one's next i thought the germans makes a good autos i have no idea see few abilities new shoes and legs okay that looks good new head shape i don't see a difference but it still looks good to me can you read a view oh sure let me just review this meme real quick what uh new face section so it doesn't look like an old asian woman okay free to a sex just to swap according to angle level we can do that matched colors to modern design this guy should just turn his head when talking to mario instead rotating the whole body i agree but how's he gonna oh god okay you see the difficulty okay i agree with your idea it is just too difficult yeah i know one person who's married to an american and wants to become like an american citizen and he's been working on it for a few months now and they said it can take another year or so in canada fortunately what you can do is you can just go there and then request a permanent stay if you're married to canadian and while your request is pending you're allowed to live and work there if you get a work permit so it's a lot better shit what's going on with this body do um this might be a fork random thing oh why are we using environment oh we are using environment color because we have to that's what's going on okay this one's gonna be a bit annoying to make work everyone's saying he looks like he's wearing a shirt it is just the back though so okay oh i don't like the environment here that's always a problem oh if we make fog here we can't multiply with shade color alpha anymore that's a bit unfortunate but it's a sacrifice i'm willing to make oh that looks poopy by comparison but i think it looks better once there's shade in game so that's the helmet so  now add some arms he has arms but you look so depressed uh i'm not happy happy happy i am so happy does that help  yeah i need an orange color that doesn't use nth color i'm not sure what you're referencing i'm not sure what you're referencing would be funny if he wears a safety suit or just one body that's fine something like be safe not the press just lock the fuck in true  all right let's see if he's still wearing his black jacket we might have to fix that then um retro knights i don't have any retro knights i flipped colors were mapped under the nose to save materials single colors like this is pretty much the cheapest material you can get yeah the feet are fucked up looking oh i hate how the feet look now Shit, something's wrong with the hands too. Yeah, because Jade was missing, cool. Oh man, the feet are so ugly. I have an idea. Oh, I have an idea. This idea is insane. You guys have no idea. I think this idea doesn't work with 3dx3 anymore. Whatever, we'll try it. Okay, I have a Fast64 script somewhere here. Okay, I need all of these to have a normal of zero. Is it the vertex size thing? Yeah, pretty much. Okay, I might just ask JGPT to write me a script. Write me a Blender script that sets the normals of all tree selected vertices to zero. Hello Lilaa, welcome, I'm programming in Python right now. You guys like my Python programming? JGPT sucks at Blender Python? I disagree. I think I just did that faster than you could. I wonder if that just didn't work. Maybe it does suck. Material distance 0, 1, 0. It didn't set any of these. Hmm. Lilaa, how do I make these export as zero vertices from Blender? Hello, Arthur. It said we have to use split normals in edit mode, but it says cool. Let's try that. Still didn't work. What does zero vertices mean? I'm trying to set the normals to zero, Lilaa. Oh, all the normals to zero. You see this? I need this to be gone. Just saying that I said that. At least I think I did. I don't even know what the fuck this is supposed to do. I imagine split normals are going to look better than not split normals here at least. Let's see what that looks like. Because if I remember correctly, Sauraen said you can't actually use this trick anymore in F3DX3 because it auto-normalizes. Oh! I forgot to check that. No wonder it looked so terrible. It's going to look so much better now. Oh, it's not about the shirt, it's about the shoes. I'm going to do the shoes first. No. Yes. Ha! Still no sharp edge here. Even though I very specifically requested a sharp edge. I mean, it looks good on them though. See, maybe you're worse than ShaneGPT. Rip LilaaGPT. Do you like boss games? I have not played a boss game. There we go. Oh, that's so nice actually. That's nicer than Shade Alpha. All right, let's fix his t-shirts. I'm too young for DOS games, guys. I know I'm becoming a dad, but I'm not 60. Yes, angriness, Lilaa. You got a problem with that? What's wrong with the angriness? Yes. There we go. He's no longer wearing a bad fit. All right, let's make him angry and see how that looks. No. Okay, he's becoming more orange, that's good. All right, even more orange. Everything keeps going wrong. I can't do it anymore. I quit. Oh, oh, oh, Biobak. This container is blocking his animation. I That's probably the only option I have, right? All right. All right. Biobak sent me all the free Wiggler faces here as well. Let me just make sure it works now. Actually, we don't need to make sure it works. Let's first import the Wiggler faces and then we'll make sure it works. Okay, we definitely don't need these three, five. It is an RGBA 16, is it not? Please tell me it is. It's a CI8. Okay, if it's a CI8, good. Let's do something else. Is that that made decent rice? Congratulations. I'm going to make a file with just the Wiggler faces in it. I just import that. How's that mean? I congratulated him. How do you make bad rice? Oh, it's possible. Okay. The lady that took your blood, you think she fucked up? Are you going to die? How come Lilaa is always on the verge of dying? Kiss you on Wiggler. Save yourself the trouble later. Wiggler. Oh, that's fine. So, there's four different phases to this. One, two, four, eight. And we have three phases. Do we just have two phases for the medium states and then one phase for the really, Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm just going to do this. Okay. Okay. For just so few people making a whole game. I think RTVI is being made in pretty reasonable amount of time. When you consider everything around it. You feel bad for the Wiggler. Can you help about it? You can just not be the stage. Pop count. It's a famous function. You can count the amount of bits. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.   Okay. Make sure to protect Raina from wood blocks. Is that what happens. Your little sister hit you with wood blocks. But how did you get hit? By your little sister. Don't you be the stronger one out of the two? She had hatred in her heart. Okay, well, you can't beat the power of hatred in your heart. That's one thing I learned from Naruto. Unless you have a lot of friendship in your heart. But I guess you just had envy for her. That's just no def. Unfair fight. Do you guys like when people talk about power scaling TV shows? Because I think it's so funny. When they're like, man, Goku could kick this guy's head off. Because you know that one time in episode 395. When Goku was fighting the guy. Kicked his head off he would do that with your guy i love that shit and i like the ridiculous ones like homeland vs 3 billion that's the fun part about it do you not see bro orange piccolo is as strong as purple vegeta god i wish dragon ball super was any good i wish you know instead of what they did they should have just made it fucking slice of life just like have the old cast and have them like live their normal lives that would have been better like the goan episodes at the beginning of the buu saga just that but it's like a whole show no more new hair colors it's basically pokemon vs lions okay but 1 billion lions or the sun who wins gohan in high school is the best thing about the buu saga i was into that when i was a little kid he looks pissed now oh that's cool you should still have the same face after this one good then after this you should look super pissed can the n64 render quads what do you mean by a quad i mean sure a quad is two triangles right and clearly you can render a triangle and then you can render a triangle again and now it's a quad but that's clearly not what you're talking about yeah minor issues with that no case what do you mean no case a unified quad as a single primitive i don't think it can i might be wrong though hello sam memory you can pass that to a yugo that can instruct in the two triangles for the rdb yeah but instead of single primitive you know it's kind of a weird question if you think about it technically you're still operating on a quad on the rendering though yeah but is that what he asked i don't know that's the same thing as the 1 billion lions or the sun question you can't answer it because you don't know what the fuck you're talking about how do you defeat the sun like at what point does the sun count as defeated i mean sure for the 1 million lions or 1 billion lions you can think about like probably means when they're dead but like how do you defeat the sun the sun doesn't die so yeah i think i have to edit this path a little bit so that this works properly let's try something like this maybe so you skilled the uvs recently i did not what is this fart song we're listening to nintendo cheerful music to make you happy like yoshi that's the perfect playlist a single particle can destroy the sun if it's going near light speed and a sufficient mass okay is there a particle that has sufficient mass you know what i don't understand if photons are going at light speed and they have energy and energy is mass wouldn't that mean that time just stands still for them wouldn't that mean that they experience the entirety of the universe like instantly does that make any sense why would this be shit he still turns too early there are kinds of 64 and 4 4 what is 4 4 again is that the retro world where is he trying to go i'm not sure so i don't know why he turns so early he turns once in the point is less than forward velocity multiplied by two away do and then he just turns here what if i just move this point like closer here so he goes further like just forwards maybe that works a little bit so he doesn't have a center of mass he just has an origin but the origin is where he moves around so it wouldn't matter which level is 4 4 again epic legends i don't actually know hello xpm welcome to trying to make the wiggler work when that koopa just died in the cutscene all right let's see this hey so close all right i think now we've got it though  i mentioned this before but i missed the correct shadows from before what are the correct shadows oh you mean um the baked shadows from the geo notes you prefer those of a biomex manual ones i think the change is mostly because um there is not actually a sun here when i do the 20 20 20 20 minutes of work then 20 minutes of family time then 20 hours of super mario 64 level making i see so if you mess around with the lip dragon does it have any features you like lip dragon has a bunch of really cool things uh but i think it still performs significantly worse than what we already use what are you drinking water so bro bro where are you going that doesn't have any impact almost doesn't have any magnifons because they travel at the speed of light they gain mass only in the presence of a generation producing particle trying to think about this so they're affected by gravity okay okay interesting that that can happen while time doesn't really exist wouldn't that mean that gravity is actually a geometric property and not a force i don't know physics hello ben yankin  trajectory end is minus one how did that not happen how did we not get to trajectory end um we clearly reached this point sure i'm a rock if you have the technical finesse to do that i don't see what would be stopping you so how how is this possible so it used to work and i didn't make any changes to this so also this is weird this is supposed to be a plus i'm pretty sure okay let me look at this one more time this time we are going to print this value here i don't really want to set up a test suit for this so i'm just going to go with it i'm just going to beat this thing again it's fine gravity is okay you so you know that it's just a creature or do we just explain it that way so what's up with the load times this is because of emulator the load times are a lot short on console emulators are just trying to emulate the lag of the n64 really inaccurately all the best to your family smile thank you zita zita what dude why why is everyone feeling so bad for the wiggler he's just a guy that gets angry hello gtm we have when is your kid releasing gtm shitposting they're gonna be shitposting in the father now true the mission looks so short by the way it's because i'm really good at mario 64 have you ever looked at mario 64 missions they are so much shorter than what i'm doing here so what the fuck so and then he just turns around and he just keeps going he keeps going random directions you see that what the fuck so i'm thinking the turn velocity is probably tied to his forward velocity yep that's why it looked so weird at the beginning is the path reading garbage i'm making it so that if the path ever ends which is minus one which is trajectory and if it moves on but for some reason this is not happening should run on this and see what it turns into if it turns into 65 336 i'm gonna be pissed if it turns into minus one i'm gonna be even more pissed because then i'm very confused as to what the fuck is going on wait could it turn into minus one nope it could not at least i don't think it could i don't think it could he has a mini mouse ambush that sounds like such a troll thing so all right now the first few should just be random x coordinates oh they're numbers for the waypoints six 2642 it should be minus one uh  if this happens it instantly moves on to the next one i see what i did okay now it's gonna work and see that's why the path was so buggy at first because i was skipping waypoints if the waypoint was higher than thing plus 200 cardinals that's probably because when i programmed this i made it so that i waypoints just count as jumps without actually being waypoints no wonder that was confusing but there was no reason for this to exist so now it's just removed Oh Okay Okay, okay Yes, there we go We fixed it. All right, and now he has facial animations When he gets upset the very nice onto the next actor janitor Cooper Oh Yes this type of broom now newish design up to the geo to match modern look a bit more Got rid of like five materials Much better shell texture. Ooh Lace shoes. Oh, he's stylish. I Monolith I Brew me a broom Lim holds Few polygons kept now visible from underneath. Oh, whoops I guess I don't need to re-export the animations I Can't give this one fuck I know it sucks, but it is what it is You Could you scale the normal's what for Yeah, it was supposed to be a mop but it's fine But no, I think we gave up on skilled moments entirely because we want to have facts free work eventually Dude always this one environment color thing. It's gonna drive me nuts that for 64 it's that You Don't even notice that he doesn't at work and you can't really see him from far away because he's up there only in the main area. Oh He's so clean Small issue Come on bro, I'll help you out Just kidding Dreamed of being a racer, but yeah, I'm mopping if you don't see any flags around and tell me and we'll just rub around By a bank you want to tell them the really funny idea we had for him, how do we keep that just a secret? Actually, you know what so few people would even get it cuz to get it you have to be very invested in this game I'm not telling shit I Sir clump Congrats on becoming a real dad. Thank you, but I'm not yet The child is not born yet. It was supposed to be born two days ago But it still takes a bit of it. I guess it's not fully cooked yet I Want to do Let me look at this on them you because I feel like this might be a box in project 64 Well that plus the fact that it logically couldn't have happened right now because You haven't been of birth control for that long Oh, I see this is crazy And then the question is why does this not look right in game this should be perfect You Geo said prim. Why are we setting the prim on him? Is this just a Koopa leftover has to be You Let's see if this is any better Well, we were using blender I do this and then this and then this and then this me when I use blender how do we set the layout again? No Please I'm slow. I'm afraid to only runs high latency or it's actual data bandwidth Okay The word slow is relative, right you need like a relation to something else and I don't I Just know that the memory bandwidth and latency both are the bottleneck for what we're doing Let me show you something funny Now that I finally have to set up I can show this whenever I want and it's awesome Oh Wait, I don't have to profile enable not fucking damn it The funny thing would have been that 76% of the CPU time is just waiting for memory But yeah, I guess I can't show it because I don't have the profiler properly set up I just have this which I guess you can still see reference for 3.6 milliseconds To 6 7 milliseconds of CPU running or maybe 9 and then like 25 milliseconds of just waiting for the memory to be done Like my pets I have fish lots of fish Let me see how this looks now That fixes it so the thing I was working on for the new overwaltz Is it like pictures or is it blender files? Ah Yes, this is for the new entrance first to Say no is making a bunch of 3d models and stuff saying I wanted to give making the new overwalt a try So I like this I think the Coopers get paid in letters And bells of our chess Even That did not fix it How is this happening this has to be a fast 64 buck at this point Lilaa look at this Unset another props. I tried that that was my first thought to What's exporting exactly I'll show you the texture I Alright, let's look at this model I Don't open up, please This is what we get But what's the one doing there I guess it's almost Western I Actually perspective and on Wait what I Well, then Why did you some perspective to nothing Did I promise that there is no way I Hey, it's beautiful the way it shines. Oh my god. He's such a shiny show. Oh My god, he looks so glowing dude everything in this level looks so It has a certain play look to it, you know what I mean Okay, not everything this level but this guy he looks like he's made of clay in a good way Is it a bit more of a creature look, you know what I mean All right, who's next and build a Cooper same changes as the janitor better helmet only six extra tries eight down to four materials 324 down to 298 triangles Don't merge it emerges. It fucks up the helmets shading needs to be linked to the armature, but I suck at that All right You Since these are shaders the n64 has a fixed shader and you can do a lot of things with it You don't want the new shell on this one as well, I think the new shell looks a lot better than what I have here Maybe even just oh Okay, I see This is your guy. This was my guy. I see I see Yeah, this definitely looks a lot better I Okay, we have to shade color alpha thing again here I think it's fine nothing if these guys fuck Yeah, of course You Wait, did the other one have that issue to we check that Also good news, I do think at this point this level does it 30 FPS pretty easily With all the changes from my back here should be no issue You Do the coupon test I think there might be a crash in the server right now Let me check right now real quick I What the fuck that sometimes happens you just have to restart it I might have to unplug it I Know they're not Yes, it doesn't love struggling with their in 64 to turn it on the real retro gaming experience I some programs driven because my computer is German. There we go Yeah That Fucked everything over. I know this area used to work. So that's probably just a stupid bug somewhere I Mean like to learn blend on the n64 plug-in. I don't think you need a guide. You can really just start You thought you speak English I do speak English how loud strife Oh No, I can't do anything get me out what's going on there we go You That's all it took to link this up by effects literally five seconds of work Oh Beautiful Oh That's a glass rendering issue you see that Oh Fixed can I reduce the slightly? All right Next would be build a Goomba, but I think we did enough for today I think this is a good point to stop. I'm gonna finish importing all these guys. I Really like how they look slow. It's gonna be so nice Do thwomp? Nah I'll let you suffer Come back next week idiot Surely let the thumb fight if my back requests it I Will do it Oh, man, that guy looks really weird Biobak you sure about this I Didn't think you'd go with something surreal like this. Oh He's nice Might have to make the collision a little bigger here to cover those But I like him Either way, I will see you guys next stream. Bye. Bye
