I don't know Hello Zayna, hello Seblastkit, hello Raptos You can hear me now Hello Selton Hello DistantPeak, hello Russianman, hello Tumbleweeb Tumbleweb So I made a lot of things happen since last stream we got Some platforming mechanics now So the guide today, we are trying to design the level today Meaning we use all the platforming mechanics we need And we place them over the level to hopefully have the game be fun We got bridges like this too I put the doors in Hello cat, we have this thing here Which if you follow the Kled's channel or my Twitter you have seen this But how fucking cool is that? You can't tell me that this is not the coolest thing ever I Love paper kitty What's it specific fate of a pattern called it doesn't have a name. I made it up Hello Hedge Scott, I invented this pattern. I needed a seamless snowflake pattern that repeats We also got this place here Which is a little bit of a difficult platforming section I will admit And I get more of it blended more I'm not showing the stance I Miss instant cutoff Not sure if I understand You mean you want them to be like bigger on the sides Instead the gist of it Yeah, I can do whatever I want ready I've not decided yet on how exactly this would look. I guess what you mean It's like you don't want this to be so harsh instead. You want it to be like smaller versions of these dots. I Can kind of see that yeah, I mean we can try it Let's give me less idea and try I Think I got your idea They will exit look exactly like this on console no difference This is the pattern by the way Here's your caffeine and you didn't just begin to feel so bad Well, maybe I got caffeine properly get off slowly Guys I can mirror this again, right? Should I just mirror this again twice? Let me try that real quick I Just didn't abuse it today Well now, you know that was a bad idea I'm gonna get on and off slowly I would say I Missed the same pattern It looks like a different pattern to me this way, I don't know actually it is the same pattern beautiful Any OST suggestions today What do y'all want to listen to You Go RTT by D OST. All right, let's do it I'm gonna consider levels you make for it on your silent half compared to my 64 the highest point that was like 50,000 the highest point I'm on my 64 is like 6,000 if you count all the areas in the level You What what the fuck kind of OST is this okay, we're not listening to TD by D never mind so just something else He tried prime I  Song from Twilight Princess I'm not doing that one either  My windows on dude, actually, I think I might become a Linux user in the new year. I Know that's a dangerously based but The shit in Windows 11 just seems too bad Curry forgotten land OST. Let's try that But isn't this entire OST just the same song over and over Yeah, Windows 7 Windows 10 isn't that big a difference fortunately Although my Windows 10 has started being misbehaving and I'm thinking they're ruining it with updates on purpose but I'm also a paranoid schizophrenic, so Maybe they're not doing it on purpose. Maybe they're just really bad Is this what you are thinking you know, this is kind of nice You see how the dots kind of grow as I get closer Oh, that is nice look at that They just kind of grow into this, oh I like that Hello so LG we just improved this effect a lot So, okay these doors here are supposed to be like forked doors that like Well, it looks weird because of them all the semi-transparent stuff behind us But basically you get close and they disappear and then this is like a room transition Me and my friend decided to make an in your game and we can't find a good thing to make What would you recommend? Not making an indie horror game. I don't like those. I don't know You hate those objects you don't like the objects here Why what's wrong with them Or do you mean the wave here, yeah, I'm not sold on the wave either The obstacles in this room, well, they're extremely lately that I don't know which room you're referring to Do you mean the waves Or do you mean these obstacles here The waves, okay, and the waves are kind of ugly I will agree with you Isn't that much delay well, maybe the delay is fix your type like a grandma like two words per minute I Need to make a zero max windows Fuck you. I'm still not a hundred percent sure what you're referring to. I'm just gonna assume you mean the waves Although I'm not sure why you would refer to the waves as the objects I'm let's get some lighting going on this level actually We probably want really bright really blue light, right Or maybe slightly blue lights It's a repo for your code public no The newest one is not public. There's an old one public and maybe next time I release a mini hack I will make a public again, but at the moment it is not all public Okay, the light did like nothing. Also dude my controller so fucked and we should work Okay Okay, our challenge today is designing the level meaning We want to start making the plan for how the platforming should go So the first platforming path in this level is you go start here you go into this room you go through here you go Through here go for here. This is gonna be a room with ice walls with like stuff frozen behind it So this one should be mostly a visual experience Up here up here and then over. Here is the boss fight And just make sure I remember everything correctly Platforming gone into a star you see early on but can't reach until later Right, so there's gonna be a star here although I guess you can't really see that early on so I'm not a fan of it They need to be some more grand scale feeling I'm not sure what you mean by that you think this level is too small I Mean I'll then close the rainbow grotto rainbow grotto is a lot smaller Not even close to be honest Just gonna get sub area ish Are you sure that's not because just we didn't finish the level yet Okay, so another someone being a platforming gauntlet up here, which might be through here and then for here And then you would be there which would be the short path. I would be here Through here you get up here somehow You come for here and then you come here We could just remove this part here if we wanted to only if the long path be viable Talking about feeling well I'm not really sure one would give a person that feeling This is open-ended it's just very Like there's many paths you can go the idea is just that every path kind of leads to a goal I Wish it could be made a little more open-ended maybe but we're still working on it Yes, yes Lena, that's what I'm trying to do right now Some area feeling Are you sure that's not because it's all like Same looking and all it's like the same vibe right now. There's no like transformation going on I Had my legs so bad on Wednesday, I still can't sit without pain It's a little distracting they're gonna be NPCs nope only enemies I kind of want to change to start here at the beginning The idea for it is very clearly that You just can see the start early and then you figure out how to get there The problem is with a star being here. You don't see it early Mario 64 maker I need that romec in 2017 And No, I have not tried and guess why would I use my romec to make a romec I'd rather just use the good tools To Mario builder, I mean I figured But I mean basically same answer why would I use Mario builder to make a romec when I can make a romec I Mean, it looks fun for like casual use. Yeah If you don't you just have like an idea that you want to make and you don't care about like making the best thing possible Should go for it Although it is very limiting Okay, how do we make it so that the player sees the star early one super easy idea would be to have a mirror here Imagine there's a mirror on the wall a big mirror and that lets you see the star. It would look cool Oh Lila How else could we make this star work We could have these stairs here go this way up and then the star could be on the sides And these entrances could be moved to the side Or we could have the entrance to the mansion be this side, but no We had some larger more exploitable areas within the linear paths, yeah, that's gonna be this part here and this part here They are going to be ledge areas Where you can you know, it's one two, three four exits here One two, three four exits here Two three four exits here That would be the idea I Just really don't like that you don't see the star that kind of ruins the whole fun concept of this I wanted this to be like a mystery until the end what if instead we have like an Ice wall here and the star is like frozen and ice and you've doing it up here to like destroy the ice wall Should be something like that maybe And the question would be what do you do to destroy the ice wall maybe a power-up We could put a big bomb our power up here What other power-ups do we even have? ice cap bomb cap Wing cap and cloud cap An ice cap related star is gonna be here Where this is gonna be like an ice cold area and while you have the ice cap on you're gonna be immune kind of like the metal cap I don't know cream team. There's no deep reason to it I Had a fire flower we're not adding the fire flower power up for one star that would be silly If you were really lucky you add an ice ring area what's an ice ring area how do you misspell cool as a book? everyone laughs at this twitch user there's gonna be quest 13 i'm just right now thinking about how to make the star that was supposed to be here visible from the entrance so that this is like the big mystery that you're trying to solve from the get-go i also just don't like that there's such a short path available here i just feel like there shouldn't be maybe this path just shouldn't be reachable and it just leads back here i certainly ice some skiing or whatever you say in animations the thing you do with those shoes no? did mcmorrow get pregnant and his belly gets bigger with every star and you have to BLG out of his stomach? no? maybe if you stay on the other side i mean yeah that would work but i feel like that's not as cool i'm thinking big ice wall with a star frozen inside it and then you destroy the ice wall somehow but my question is or what i'm wondering is how do we best make it so that you destroy the ice wall? the obvious thing would be there would be a switch here and that triggers some kind of mechanism that just shatters it oh ice skating yeah ice skating is kinda neat we can add some super slippery areas that basically act like ice skating i mean that's kind of what the stage under here is for the idea here is this is a frozen lake and you slide down here and then you go to a frozen lake and then you go through some prison chambers and then this is a super cool area ground pound the ice block it's a wall hello z64 switch drops the platform and the ice shatters on the floor releasing the star ok well to better illustrate what i mean is my idea would be like this and like like this and then there's just a huge wall of ice here like so and then behind it is a star frozen i don't know lila i don't care yet how are you doing? good good there could be a big ice ball here or a big snowball that you just roll into it like you could just do something like this and then you just roll the snowball down yes this level has a boss it's the raven from yoshi's island small ice cubes that you can kick and punch to break and you have to mine for the star nah no this is quest 13 not the last one i mean this would kind of make it like really obvious the problem is i don't like rolling a snowball into it i just don't think that's very good there also just isn't really the space for it here so i'm not a fan of that there could be a big chandelier here i would like a chandelier like from the top of the castle and then you crash that into here maybe somehow i don't know what the puzzle you're referring to is lila can raven roll into it when you beat him? the boss is unrelated to the star the boss is star 3 this is star 1 change some chandelier? no no no just a big royal chandelier because this is like a castle mansion thing hello beatark there were chandeliers like that in mario rpg let me check oh i see i don't know what you do with them looks like you just fight on them but yeah the chandelier would just be swinging back and forth and then you'd have to do something to make it swing more wait this would be a sick mechanic imagine there's a chandelier hanging from the ceiling and when you walk to the left side you kind of make it go this and then you walk to the right side and goes like this you know what i mean and then you can go side to side to make it swing harder and harder until you eventually hit into the wall that would be kind of sick hello tabarius the problem is how do i program this without using the throw matrix i mean that would have to be like a quaternion thing right god do i have to program the entire quaternion math we don't have any of that in r64 yet it seems quite excessive if i could just lock it into one axis without it looking bad that would make it easier for the player and be a lot easier to program honestly the easier for the player thing is what really makes me want to do it i'm thinking there would be like a holster like this with a chain coming out and the chain can only move this way you know like the swinging ship like this and then you walk to this side and you know that makes it swing until you hit the chandelier into this thing let's do that let's program the chandelier just hitting some sort of hazard to the chandelier i don't think we need it any more difficult than it already will be we can also use the chandeliers in these platforming parts here which is very very nice we could just hang up one here and that would allow us to move here or here the one thing i'm worried about is that they're going to be really difficult to use and also we kind of need to introduce them in a way that the player can't miss it where could we do that we might have to add an extra room for that this room here would be a prime target for that we could move this concept over here and then add the chandelier here hello nonameuv let's do that i don't know what debian is i'm pretty sure debian is a type of linux distribution i'm pretty sure i always knew and i just was using the words differently i don't know well i originally was just using whatever revo recommended to set up decomp with so if you want to use debian mix you don't need to use debian well none of that matters to me i just want to hack mario sorry that i can convert decomp c code into whatever mips64 uses. you mean a compiler? there is. it's called gcc so you can average undertale map layout well this is kinda how we box it out and then eventually we make the real thing guys i literally never want to update my software ever unless there is something wrong with it cause everytime software updates it introduces new bugs and i have to get used to new bugs the old bugs i'm already used to i'm gonna make sure i do it that is true update to get all the latest bugs yeah the whole windows 10 thing is why i'm thinking of switching to linux next time or when windows 10 runs out windows is your issue? it's not just windows, blender does that too and i have to update blender because they update fast64 to only work with the new blender versions and i do need the fast64 updates because there are legitimate bugs i need fixed oh oh samah thank you for the hint samah while you're here do you also want to give me graphical tips on maybe i should change this? or do you think i can leave a like for the final game? i mean just give it to me alright i'll ship it stop lying to yourself what do you mean yeah the human being shouldn't be stressed so much? okay thank you i would have just left it like that but now that you pointed it out i think i will change that guys i can't do the kirby ost anymore i'm so sick of this i can't give me something else will channelia's chain be climbable? no because when it swings mario would have to swing with the climbing thing and that's just not supported by sanctions right now pkc ost let's do that that's good fucking lemonade guys do you prefer sweet lemonade or sour lemonade? that's good you know i just had to put you on the spot for commenting that you were doing the leela thing in my chat while leela was here how many more levels do you plan on making? until all the levels are done in this game salty lemonade? sweet lemonade? sour lemonade? well we got all three flavors bitter lemonade too? yeah i prefer sour lemonade too sweet and sour same way you like your chicken respectable can you bench press for us respectfully? there's just like 153 pounds on it right now i can't do a real bench press for you unfortunately without setting it up yeah yeah linux has not come to my ready yet if you ask me but i have high hopes in it for the future yeah yeah just not yeah true well no it is non-technetroid friendly oh but it's non-technetroid friendly cic hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello yes yeah yeah you Out recently and that's been slowing down my workflow. Can you play games with linux by now? What's the things you can do with linux? What do you do when you want to use photoshop? Do you just use GIMP? You can? Okay, that's good. What's yoshi's favorite fruit? No yoshi berry?  Obviously. Have you ever played yoshi's story? You can't play fortnite on linux? It's over guys. Pack it up. How do you call it linux? Is that the correct name? I'm just trying to say it how the english people say it. Linux? It's pronounced like you would call it in german linux.  That's just wrong. Pronounce it. Hello, this is Linus Sturwaltz and I pronounce linux as linux. linux! what? linux!  linux!  So this is like the german pronunciation! Second, what am I checking now? WineHQ? You're still saying it wrong? No he says linux, you just can't handle it because you have to the american tongue americans cannot pronounce the word it is what it is okay let's get some textures for this and then we import this as the next swinging chandelier here i could use better uv mapping though you think so you think i should get rid of the black part here subtle yeah, not a fan of this texture should i make the chains connect to add the octagon tips instead of the sides the octagon, oh i see what you mean, no i don't see what you mean oh you mean to rotate this here 45 degrees, nah that would look gross it will not blow up only that way because it's like not balanced, i don't know how to put it it will look like a very very snowy chandelier if i'm done here, hopefully what is my opinion on v3313, i do not care about v3313, does not look like an interesting concept to me i have never played it that's kind of sick i think, i kind of like this what is my opinion on world hunger, i am against it because i'm a good person i mean technically i am contributing towards world hunger because i am eating more food than i produce correct are gonna be candles on the chandelier if it's made from ice um these can just be like frozen they don't actually have to be chandeliers that glow uh you blame me entirely for the whole thing hello neovim, world hunger is not a production issue, it's a transport issue, true and world hunger but no big yoshi, that's a tough question can we get a 50 50 on this one, did you see it, did you subscribe and i didn't see it, if so i'm so sorry and if so then thank you very much for the subscription i guess my alerts are still broken which is very unfortunate when i was little there was a game website on skull that you could solve math questions for they got oh the more grains you got the kids didn't even get the grains you got them interesting yeah well welcome to the gang so it just accumulated in those points i see i see so you do math homework for like 30 minutes and the kids get like 20 grains of rice thank you for the 15 calories mister seems kind of like they're not getting a whole lot out of that  wait wait wait wait ah there are duplicate triangles on this, did biobank sneak in a triangle it should be slippery but not super slippery because if it's super slippery then the gameplay is not going to be good i think biobank snuck a triangle in here um  more than one even might have been me too either way that's six triangles down yeah we're still working on it michi we're trying to uh figure out the best way to make this look first well i will first change these to vectors then i'm probably gonna change the candles for just a block of ice if i leave the candles at all i'm not actually sure um so yeah i like this hello sailor cherry oh yeah many of you guys missed this because we did this at the beginning of the stream but we improved the appearing path effect from earlier let me show you oh i'm in the wrong stopping area let me just get that real quick i like all the little platforming gimmicks here we're gonna be able to make some pretty cool platforming here there you see how they now grow first and then like they slowly grow into the whole thing it's not as abrupt anymore i like that a lot and i really like how all the limitations here are like accounted for and what you might not be able to tell is that this is like a snowball pattern and not a snowball like a snowflake pattern maybe if i zoom in yeah you can see you see this how this is like a snowflake but now also this part of the snowflake is part of this snowflake and then this part of the snowflake is part of this snowflake you know what i mean i love how this looks this is such a cool pattern i invented so 2019 photoshop i can't help we are not updating software in this stream yep that's from a texture i had to invent that data pattern it did not exist before and i invented it by like doing a hexagon grid and then just drawing onto it don't like the song uh did you and did this guy put the song in question if not then i cannot listen to that i don't want to click on random links people send me did you write a scientific article about it no i'm pretty sure it existed before it just i hadn't seen anyone talk about it so i guess we're talking about the greater scale like in this course where it's way cooler when it plays this design authentically the rooms also serve real purpose just like in snowpeak ruins yeah i'm thinking about uh theming all the rooms differently so there's gonna be like the lobby there's gonna be a diner room there's gonna be um a library stuff like that you know but that's the the theming is gonna be after the platforming is the theming should be secondary to the gameplay yeah i don't click on links yoshi unless it's important because it is very disruptive to my streaming experience um hello sunbury studios that's cool good to hear what is the sound rate of the music 32 kilohertz in-game oh in-game then um 32 kilohertz  why can't the top square of the inverse pyramid and center of the chandelier be made from two triangles instead of four because of your v-mapping won't look good um nice design floors red carpet window and stuff would look amazing oh yeah having like carpets with snow on them you know that would look really good i do like the way you envision this so these are not actually candles they're just shards of ice stuck in here  what about a magical time blue flame nah no flame at all  the background music is diddy kong donkey kong country so now it's in a mountaintop we do want the mountain village around if you leave the castle but that's just a side area that's going to be like a very small part of this do you I think I know like this works I'm thinking of maybe removing a few of these change chains just to make this a little easier because you will need to do some relatively difficult platforming on this I think the max is 32 kilohertz but I'm not 100 sure it might be 48 there was Michael Jackson sounds in the previous video I had no idea I did not realize this is the restored version of the OST um the chains have no collision but they do obstruct view how do i recall this control chandelier one two zero let me check definitely needs to be a lot longer this chandelier might suck a little bit performance-wise but it should be fine oh that's too low shit i don't want the player to be able to reach it from anywhere but here yeah i have to pause Mario 64 summary i'm gonna make my own games i really just want to finish this game here and then i can move on to that maybe this would be a good height what are you reading right now move from quake and flash uh yeah i mean i do already work in Unreal Engine 5 video game development so i do know how everything works i just haven't really worked with it yet like in my own time so how can we lay out the geometry to stop players from unintentionally moving onto the chandelier we could have the stairs go like here but i feel like that wouldn't prevent that let me check this out in game shit one of the materials is bad okay it's gonna look a little weird but that's fine yeah exactly sunbury this will be pretty insane advertisement for whenever i do my own game so and marketing seems to be basically like 90 of the equations as making a game course  yeah you can just skip from there  and reaching it from here kind of blows and you can't even really see it from here maybe the chandelier idea was not good so the x1 idea is so cool i want it to work so oh god what is zaina doing you guys can't hear it but i think she's taking the house apart so just move the thing up but then it can't crash into this anymore and look good oh you're removing things together your mom's here i see i see um hello playman is there another way to do this i have big ice wall i want the big ice wall to be seen at the beginning i want the player to see the frozen star and then i want the player to get the star so i also the problem with the chandelier is going to be that you're going to be not having enough velocity to realistically shatter this i think the chandelier idea is actually not there it's just not good to unfreeze it i don't want this level to unfreeze i just want to shatter the wall or get behind the wall somehow we can have some kind of surreal mechanic to get behind the wall i'm not opposed to that so so hmm hmm oh the star no it's behind the wall just unfreezing the star doesn't do anything cannonball like a cannon and you shoot the cannon into it it kind of works two chandeliers have them in the corners next to the entrance i think the swinging just doesn't work at all and the swinging might work as like a platforming mechanic in a different room like this one here but it doesn't work here we just need a different mechanic all together to get behind the star and to recap real quick i want that when you enter this area here the first thing you see like within the first five seconds of playing the level is you see a star but you have no idea how to get there and it's it's supposed to like stick in your minds and then like you go through the mansion and you find a way to get to the star eventually uh we're not melting anything this is all ice i don't want there to be fire it's not the feeling i want you know i'm thinking it might be better to just have mario be able to get behind the ice wall somehow maybe the ice wall just wasn't the right idea so this requires some creative thinking hello sunvac we don't use the vanish cap now only visible in the reflection i mean it's doable but then we need other stuff only visible in the reflection to make the player realize that yeah a cannon is the closest to actually working so far i think the rice and lower chandeliers with switches oh that could kind of work yeah i guess we could similarly have a mechanic to make chandeliers swing or something no no puzzles yeah it's kind of like a mysterious ice castle that's the idea because it's like a mysterious ice castle i'm not opposed to having like a warp somewhere maybe fading warps should be like a thing in this you know the fading warps in the flower patches in mario 64 maybe there should be a few of those in the castle i think it fits the theme well maybe we can use that to better connect the places so keep in mind a lot of the castle is going to look like this just overgrown with ice and snow at the bottom glass mirrors as teleports i'm not sure i understand you mean like there's a mirror that shows you a different world and you jump in and then you like jump out of that part of the world they could work out pretty well but that seems like an absolute pain to work with honestly if we go with this ice thing we do need this to be different we did you just can't have this maybe the slopes are better like this because now we have access to the ice wall and we can put stuff behind it so this is a little better so if the camera looks at the mirror enough now on level start we can maybe use this yeah yeah if we have a star here i think that will be visible good and honestly the place feels a lot less cramped now kind of like that but it also feels less like a log to me i don't like that part so please stop talking about b3313 to me it is extremely annoying if you're just being off topic about stuff i don't care about so i use project 64 1.6 and i'll make a manhouse so yeah and that just doesn't look like stairs at all like that ideally we would have the view kind of be like directed here you know what i mean like you have the ice wall here and then to the left of the ice wall maybe like two spiral staircases upwards and one spiral staircase would lead to like a floor here yeah yeah i think we should not consider this as like a set in stone thing like this whole place here instead we should just kind of have this as like a guideline you know right so now there would be space for two spiral staircases kind of like going up here and there's a small ice wall here and then we can still figure out how to destroy that yeah spiral staircases was the original idea here we flank the room a bit to have a better view and everything well i guess i kind of did something similar to that in making the elements smaller right so this would be your first view and then to the right of it you'd see a staircase and to the left of it you'd see a staircase and it would go there and to a floor there and they would be too slippery to actually climb but there would be staircases and it would look very cool and then maybe two small staircases to something half height over here i think that has potential and how do i mark my desire to do a spiral staircase here without getting confused about this again but  that's not a good spiral staircase at all so yeah something like this you There's a half-spine staircase I mentioned, it's just twisted and curved. Half-spine staircase, let me see that. I don't like this, hmm. I think what I did here works pretty well. They are, hmm, honestly this could be even cooler looking. Not what I initially intended, but I think it might work. And then maybe this would be like a normal staircase connecting this to here, but the size difference, the size difference sucks. Let's just try this kind of layout, hello Hashi! You missed Leela, I'm very sorry about that, Leela actually had the banger idea today and you missed it. Okay yeah, that redirects the view into that really nicely, it's almost like an arrow pointing at it. And they make for such cool slides too, how would you tell me? Aren't you happy to know that a Leela moment happened and like it worked out well? Isn't the happiness just from knowing that happened bigger than the disappointment from How dare you KS, fuck you! Okay you know what we don't have yet? Sure now we have a layout that kind of works, but what we don't have is, how the fuck did you break the ice block? We did all that just to dodge the question. Make a little playground for fun, playgrounds are pretty fun in Mario 64. Is anybody here just fine with it? True. It could just be a slide to just run into this, but then how would the player know to slide down? I am not on trend now, I'm kind of thinking it would be fun to be on trend because I feel like being on trend unlocks your inner sigma male, you know what I mean? It just makes you completely crazy, like you completely lose your mind from what I heard. You just become an entirely different person, turns anyone into a dangerous individual, it ruins your life entirely. Trend my male, true. Balcony type thing, well this kind of isn't like a balcony isn't it? I can maybe make this a bit bigger. So an aniver starts on me, it's a freak like big Lenny was. Isn't aniver like one of the less male hormone type things, isn't that why women take it usually? How many fucking steroid users are in my twitch chat? Oh okay, it wasn't just aniver, I see, I see. I have still not yet touched steroids, if I ever will, I will let you know, because I don't want to give anyone unrealistic expectations. And one easy way out would be to just put a pipe here and then the pipe leads to the star. That's lame though, I don't like that. The point of the other spiral stars, for now, they just look cool. But maybe we should just connect them like that, and then it's a slide down, yippee. Now we think about this later, we want this all to be kind of like a playground. The room deepens there further in the back, it's hard to explain. Yeah, I'm not sure I understand, although one thing maybe I would like to do is to like put the lower part here kind of below this, just because that makes more sense as a castle design. Or actually no, this is kind of like a thing in front, connected balcony. You mean, something like this, where it's like an entire upper floor? I think that could work, but before we do anything, we kind of need the mechanic for how to even get to the star. Hello, what's up?   Let's watch Hannover. You look amazing as you are, Nettie and MarioBalls. True, true. Weed is bad, I don't like weed. It stinks. You plan on being Nettie? Wait, you were in Hannover and you plan on being Nettie? Isn't that something you can never get back? Because you keep the increased Maya nuclei, right? The little boost you got, like a small percentage of the boost you get on steroids is going to stay with you forever. You already cheated, you cannot go back. It's probably still going to be healthier to hop off of it. Hello, Sam Emery. Why does anyone say... Watch Hannover, my name is Wacha Hinovator. Wacha Hinovator. Well, no one would assume that's German. The hell is a Hinovator? I'll see you capitalized it. Hello, Tyrafin. Yes, all of this is kind of like slidey. So these are stairs, but you can't go up them. Cannon is an option still. Don't like cannon. Do I have any other ideas written down in my block here that might be helpful here? Oh, we can definitely use the snowman with the snowball, but I already mentioned that. And I think that's just not very good. Good. Themes. Glue rooms. What level did Nintendo use for the original game? No idea. Probably something they made in-house. I like how you say Sigma Mill in a way that doesn't make it sound like you watch Brainrot all day. I mean, that was a word before the Brainrot came, right? So I already did this, so I can put a plus here. Oh yeah, Dimension Mario 64 does have a staircase kinda. Well, and I guess Peach's Castle has a rotating staircase like this. What we could do is we could just have like a slide from here to here. Although no, that would block the view. No, that's lame. That sucks. Now... I think a cannon can actually not aim far enough down for this. There was a plan to have like maybe swinging axes that you have to get past. We could use one of those, but I think getting past the swinging axes just also is not fun, so I don't want to do those. I use Fast64 Handlebar. It's a tool that converts Blender models to F3D or F3DX data. Basically, most of the N64 microcodes are supported. I don't know if you can see it, but I'm using the F3DX handlebar.   God, why is this so difficult? I don't want to leave this for later. What if there is no solution? Okay, the laziest idea would be to just put a bomb cap power-up here. And then you can blow this up with the bomb cap. The thing I don't like about that is that it makes the bomb cap mandatory for the first star. I'm getting quite desperate, though. Hello, Pablo. Post-scripting and exporting N64 games. I use Mario 64 Deep Grump. The issue with the first star... The first star... What I want to happen is that when you enter the level, I want you to immediately see the first star. So we got that done. The first star is going to be frozen behind the ice here. And then you have to climb through the mansion. Most likely what you'll have to do is climb here, and then there'll be a lot of platforming to get up here. And then you go through here. Then you should be there. Okay, that's the wrong power-up. And then we need a way to actually break the ice. So the problem is, I can't think of a good way to do this. I'm thinking of just using the bomb cap now. Which is a very easy and cheap solution. But it's not going to work. It's not very creative, you know what I mean? I'd rather show them a cool idea. Drop it on the side so it gets fast enough to slide for a bob-omb? No. That seems very jank. Will BLJ shoot Mario into the ice? I think that might not be a good game mechanic. If you use this, this is kind of nice though. Because this is like the, oh, it's all coming together moment, right? Because you notice, oh, now that I have the bomb cap, I can open this thing. Roller boulder? I was thinking of rolling a snowball into it. A big snowball. That might be our best option after all. The problem is, there's just not a lot of space here, you know? But I think we can make it work. If I just cut out some parts a little more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. And I think we can do that. Imagine you're stuck on that upper platform and you have to release it. It falls and sinks as well. That wouldn't work, but then like how do you get it unstuck, you know? That's kind of like just shifting the issue. I think the snowball might work better. Yes, you can, Wacha. You got the widen? I don't think the wideness is the problem. I think I'm just going to move it into this direction here. Maybe a little bit. And that's no issue at all because I can just... Right, this gives us an extra thousand units to play with. One second. Figuring it out. Don't panic. Ew, now I need to have curved corners here. Which is fine. Honestly, some curved corners probably do this level some good. And I should probably add those later anyway. Cursed? Damn. He called my level cursed. Hello, Hamburg. Moving the room in the direction of the magnetic to make it swing. I think the snowball idea is the most on-theme one. You think if there's just a snowball here? Maybe a snowball on a platform like in Snowman's Land. Maybe then people can figure it out. Okay. I have not played Yo-Kai Watch now. I don't really care. Play video games yeah like okay imagine this and then we make this a little more slide looking sure leave this will make people like oh we're gonna roll the snowman on there especially because they won't be attacked by snowmen here anyway so they will already know that the snowballs roll around and then they'll just see it one long one that doesn't roll around let me just put the wood texture on this we're small enough for now you can also have just like a canon marion trickle with a ground pound on a switch or something with him if you can shoot the snowball through the ice yeah but that's just lame that's just kind of jank you know what i mean it's just a random mechanism at that let me just check just get a quick vibe check here okay that works perfectly and then how does it feel entering this area here oh yeah you walk for a year and you just see the big snowball and then you'd be a bit confused like where am i and you'd look around and you're like oh that's the star i couldn't get and then maybe you push the snowball and you follow the snowball and land right on the star yep i think that's be very cool i think we figured it out yeah if it's a big enough snowball surely that would break the ice all right let's see what are our stars here star one platforming out onto a star you see early but can't reach under later think of big boss horn puzzle of the library kind of too easy you have no idea how difficult this is i didn't even put anything in yet some annoying followers oh maybe that happened like last stream too or maybe i'm just super popular today yeah so if you make this unreachable that means you have to go here here here here you can't really reach this place this place kind of does nothing actually it kind of is cool that it exists so you know i'm thinking of a way to reach there from here too i think there should be a way to reach that place just because it makes the thing more interconnected he's above right now for now i'm just gonna connect them like so it's still on we'll rework this into something decent later on wait this oh my god wanna be famous you just got 2000 followers you want to get more called this fake number that's not real that's someone in chat wanting me to call their personal number and talk to me dude i wish i was famous sour og god damn if only i was famous my castle needs a cuss dude could you imagine being famous oh my god that would be so cool maybe other famous people would talk to me i will be the next jay-z i think if we do this you can actually do some sick shit like that and get up there maybe i mean i think it is possible yeah you can technically shortcut the whole thing like this which at that point fine you get it assuming the tower that leads to the castle keep where the boss is waiting and throughout the mission you have to find your way there that's exactly what we do actually you see this at the end that's gonna be like the tower where you walk into to find the boss and the boss fight is gonna be on top of the castle and there's gonna be the moon behind it and then you see the moon and then slowly from the bottom you see like a shadow come up and the moon is slowly being hidden and your whole screen goes black and then out of the pure black you see two eyes just opening up and that's the boss intro yep that's just an end mapped transparent decal cell there's so many bots following i don't know you made a thing let's see penguin low poly statue oh let's see ah yeah i do like it it's a pretty good texture actually for this thing it works really well oh it's because of the the vertex colors that it looks so good i see okay wait zayna i have a sick idea let me just place one of these in the castle and then show you what the idea i have that song went on for long enough we should be able to push the snowball and smash an ice penguin you know what that should be that should be a thing for something else that should be one of the yoshi coins let me just make a note for that yoshi coins smash an ice statue with a snowball from a snowman anime do we want this to look low poly or to be smooth zayna which one do you prefer we can get ice reflections like this on it or yeah it's all gonna be bricks and ice cherry that's the idea and snow well they're both low poly one is just smooth shit that didn't copy the whole thing the flat shaded one looks like when i peel the potatoes instead of my mom and she calls me the best potato peeler in the world i forgot to make them part of the level cool honestly this might not become part of the level these might just be objects and then the objects would be destructible and also would save a little bit of memory because i think we are not going to run into performance issues but rather memory issues in this level here yeah it looks very very nice maybe i made them a little bit too big but yeah i like this a lot the walls look a little cursed with this uv map hello lila thank you lila yeah i think i'm happy with this plan looks too blue i like it all right let's go over all the stars platforming gauntlets to get there check we got that might have to make this inaccessible or very difficult start to the snowman cave path so the snowman cave path you get by going in here and then through here through here and then you get there alternative path is you somehow go out of here and then in here and then in here and then there so there's many paths as long as you go forward you're gonna reach a star star free boss fight with the big raven you have to go here here and then here here or you can go into here here and then slide down here which lets you skip this whole section here if you want it's about the same work i would say maybe it's a little bit longer or you could even go here and then slide down so there's many different ways to enter the raven path i imagine it might be one of the first few things you see through the cold haze room the cold haze room is um same start but you go down here and then this is a little bit of a linear gauntlet do you use case case no and then um reds in the outside area and the 8-bit pipe somewhere it just says somewhere i didn't actually decide where the 8-bit pipe would be yet so that's still gonna be a question usually i like to do the 8-bit pipes in the same way that i did the star one in this area here where i kind of show it but then i don't tell you how to get there it's going well zelda except for my knee injury snow-covered huts oh for the outside area yeah that would be very nice this would be goofy if you went here went down and then here but yeah we do have to plan the 8-bit pipe in somehow so i think what would be cool for the bit pipe is if it wasn't one of these jail cells and you couldn't enter it unless you fell from above i have an idea you know how in all those 2d mario games new super mario bros and stuff sometimes there's walls that you can just walk into what if we did that but for the 8-bit pipe we made a wall that you have to walk into they are going to be live penguins but they're not in a castle they were all chased out and now they're hiding outside in their huts all scared of the big monster living in the mysterious castle secret entrance from outside oh that works too we could have them be a whole outside somewhere you can just go into to like slide into one of these i really like the idea of just the the non-solid wall though i gotta have that somewhere i'm gonna note that down for a yoshi coin idea non-solid wall somewhere combine both maybe i mean secret entrance i think is a very good concept for this well yeah of course we would combine them like that and the the idea would be that as soon as you see the pipe and the exit you would immediately know or maybe when you see the pipe you wouldn't know that there's a secret exit outside maybe you'd have to kind of like use your knowledge of the map layout to figure it out but i'm not sure how that would work it seems potentially very frustrating nah there's gonna be no penguin following so secret exit is supposed to be secrets maybe an npc tells you about it no you don't talk to npcs in this game oh breaking a window could be fun although there is gonna be windows here like this one here with some wind coming out of it and then it's gonna be a platforming mechanic hmm i think i'm gonna think some more on this later and for now i'm done the knee pain is getting pretty bad and i need to get up so i will be seeing you guys some other time next week until then bye
