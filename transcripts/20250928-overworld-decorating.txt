Hello. Hello, Sembo. Hello, Selton. Now, clearly it wants a pitch here. The hell? Was it not enough? That is bizarre. Oh well, it is what it is. For now. Where do you live? Canada. Hello, Rixie. Hello, Lunar Festival. I just want to fix one more bug here, and then we move on to the overworld. Guten tag. 0xb. Okay, there's a checkpoint. This part is also fixed. Okay, on to the overworld. Are you studying Applied Mathematics? No, I'm just studying Mathematics. 2026 or 2027? Yeah, probably one of those two. Hello, Excellent Gamer. I think I understand my general plan is to be able to free the engine of the moral use of outside libraries. What general fields would you suggest putting most effort in for that? Linear Algebra. That's by far the most important subject. Honestly, that is the only important mathematical subject. So today we're going to start on the jungle clearing here. It's 5 and then 3, 2. Okay, that's good. You'll need to know all the matrix math stuff. That's really what it's all about. Why is Linear Algebra important? Because that's how you render objects. You use Linear Algebra to compute transformation matrices. The idea is a matrix can transform coordinate systems. And when you render an object, you need to transform coordinates from local to world space. You need to be able to compute the matrix for that. If you make a 3D engine. I'll call you Benjamin Savory. You need to learn homogeneous coordinates and projective transforms. Okay, we didn't learn projective transforms in Linear Algebra. But homogeneous coordinates, I'm pretty sure we had that or something very similar to that. I mean, Linear Algebra definitely gives you the tools to be able to learn about projective transforms though. I never really perceived the math courses I've taken in uni as courses that give you the tools. Courses that give you knowledge, but rather courses that give you skills to be able to acquire knowledge. I'm shocked people think it looks good, because it really doesn't. Bro, I got good RNG on my contractor. We had a contractor to work on our driveway. It cost like $26,000. But he miscalculated taxes, so I'm saving $300. That's awesome. Do I have to tell him that he miscalculated taxes? What am I not using for this? FAS64. Linear Algebra is not going to make it much faster. Linear Algebra is the basic entry to be able to make a game at all. If the original devs didn't know Linear Algebra, they wouldn't be able to make Mario 64. Any OST wishes today? Donkey Kong Country 2. Can you use Linear Algebra to optimize matrix and vector math? How do you even have matrix and vector math without knowing Linear Algebra? It's like saying you can learn about sandwiches to make a burger. If you don't know about sandwiches, you can't make a burger. That's probably Sambo. I like the OST and I don't want VKC2. I do not feel like it. That's so overplayed. Nintendo 4 music? Okay. Also, I have really bad news about the state of my robotic lawnmower. He is currently out of commission. Because they reworked the driveway and they fucked up his wires. It's devastating. I need to go to 5. And then 0xd6 and 0xe6. What's level script stack? Do you see that here? That's... Why does it say to remove that? We don't actually need to remove that. That's the level script stack. I don't know what you want. When we store loot points and stuff. Actually, we reworked a lot of how the level script works. It's much less code now and very different code. When did the foliage get updated? I don't know. Some people know some LinearUnderground and write some horribly unorthodox code. Mostly because they don't know enough LinearUnderground. I mean, that might be what happened in Mario 64. It does look a little bit like they just copy-pasted an algorithm that they found online. Or made them without doing any optimization. Like, applying a scalematics to apply a scale instead of just getting maxed with a scalar. Or the same with translation. That's funny, because that might actually be exactly what happened in Mario 64. Let me see. Let's look at how they do object scaling. mtxf scale-vec3f Oh no, they don't completely fuck it up. Oh, and they actually have a translate and rotate matrix too. That doesn't look horrible. Maybe it's not that bad. Happens all the time in 64 in the ass. Yeah, but it was 2004. They couldn't have known, I guess, the year. How much did this commission cost? Which commission? This game is not a commission. I'm also fine to enjoy this forever long, but I'm just curious if I thought about what you'd do next. Probably just making my own games. Like, full custom IP. I now have three years of experience in Unreal. And even though Unreal sucks, I don't really want to use Unreal. Maybe I should use something else. No, no, no, it was 2004. They couldn't have known. And if you say anything else, then the NetHandle fans will kill you. They really struck me on R64. I'm still planning to, but I need to find an angle on how I can market this. How can I release the game without getting demonetized is the thing. Like, I'd probably have to call it First Person Shooter Mario with Stock Trading. Oh wait, taxes are only 14%, not 15%. Maybe the guy didn't copy your tax wrong. Okay, nevermind. Why is tax on buildings only 14%? I thought everything was 15% taxed here in Canada. Hello Creamtema. Undefined reference to behave 1 coin. Let's fix that. Area 4. I gotta run my script to rename all the actors. Create a game with original IP first and let modders figure out you released the mod elsewhere. Um... Oh, I don't want to put in that work. I'm gonna GTA Mario for GTA 6. Just pretend it wasn't me who made the game. Just pretend the game just appeared out of the ether, uploaded on an old account. City Demon is all your content in this game? Like the GameScripts videos? Uh, no. Wait, is Exit Curse always the death warp? Or did I fuck it up somehow? I thought Exit Curse was the normal warp. Well, actually yes, my King's Club streams are all demonetized because of the music. Something went wrong. Did I put the warps in the wrong order? Deathwarp should always be E6, right? I must have confused myself somehow. I mean, I guess it works now. I have a playlist. I just pick the songs that people send me or ask for. Okay, we had a plan for a divine Dino Domain back entrance. Very secret, almost no one should find this. Where would that go? See, the idea was, um... Because you see right here is Dino Domain, so Dino Domain world space wise is somewhere in here. There could be a secret entrance to enhance the feeling that this is one overworld. A equals B. B equals A. X equals switch to run. Y equals C, camera perspective. L equals C. I could scroll out our camera. Wait, what controller are we talking about here? Dimensio. Do I have to look at an Xbox controller like this here? This would be the punch button. Would be the jump button. Okay, that's already fucked up. They're the wrong way around. X equals switch to run. Y equals C, camera perspective. L equals C. R equals scroll to our camera. Okay, how do you scroll the camera into the opposite direction? Huh? And then how do you long jump? With the Z2 button? I guess this is so you don't have to use the stick here for C buttons. Based on Mario 64 DS. Okay, but no one's playing this game on Nintendo DS, so this makes no sense, right? Also, that doesn't sound right. How do you turn the camera the other way in Mario 64 DS? I have never played the Gex games. Now, something about the info you're giving me just doesn't compute. It doesn't check out. L and R. Notepiece clearly said L and C. Is it touch screen? I'm not adding touch screen to this game. Let's see what happens. That's some OS variable. I don't know which one. But I don't even have Project 64 debugger, so I'm lucky. Man, we have so little plant here. We need to do something to this area. There's just one Yoshi plant that's doing a jump here. Hmm. What if we cut this part out with the freehuts here? I think the freehuts don't add anything. Except more wasted space. I am going to destroy these freehuts. What if the entrance was a dino skull? Or the top jaw? That sounds like a great idea, yeah. This is not like a finished version. This is just the first draft. But you're right, I should put that in here. Let me make a note for that. Entrance is a dino skull. Let's walk into the jaw. I don't know if you ever formally sent me that idea. But it's a good one. Well, I don't think you're thinking of a different end level entrance. This is the one where that dino jaw idea would be fitting. This is Jurassic Jungle. Hello, Squishy Slash. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me see my notes for you. So we have other parts visible, okay. Pirate Raids, yes. Yoshi houses, sure. We have Yoshi houses. Rocks and lake. We don't have any trees. Thank you for sponsoring Bluecoin if you don't fall down. Okay. Bonus tip for grabbing a toy out of the lake. We don't have that. We're going to need to change currently after the video like this, okay. Yoshi dojo, okay, okay. No decoration somewhere. This is a temporary model. We don't do any decorating right now. It would be a waste of my time. I might release the TXT file. Doesn't really matter to me. RVM rubber ducky. Well, we don't even know that we want to do that yet. I actually think we have a bit of a problem here. That is that we have so many side levels planned, but we don't have the entrances written down yet. None of these are planned to be anywhere yet, I think. I haven't planned some of these out yet. I think this one's planned somewhere. I don't know, let's just read that this would be here. Okay, I need some sort of progress marker to save where I've done what. Okay, this is an issue. Oh, okay. Do we really want the slide here? Do we want the slide at all, actually? I guess I might as well put it. I guess this is also planned. It is in part 10. A yacht and an oil tanker? That's kind of cringe. We kind of both. Maybe we can. Maybe it's fine. Why did I put this part 11? I think S3 was planned too. Okay, part 14. David. Also in part 10, okay. Yacht is pronounced like the letter J in German, because that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think we have this planned anywhere. Part 10. We have so much in part 10. Wait, what the hell? That's three side levels in one part. Maybe that's too much. We could cut down on some of this. Honestly, I feel like this area could take a side level entrance, like a secret level that we put somewhere. But the side levels, they're planned to be really quick ones that are really simple to make. I think M1 is planned somewhere. Part 1. That makes sense. Okay. Why does it not highlight the stuff that I select? It usually does. How do I make it highlight everything that is the same as what I selected? Does anyone know? It used to do this, and now it doesn't anymore. And that is fucking with my workflow. Do I recommend using Vim? No. What a stupid idea. Thank you, Koki. Okay, so quite a few still need a place. How close are you to the ROM size limit? I think we have two and a half megabytes left. But keep in mind, almost the entire ROM size is taken up by streamed audio. And at this point, we no longer need to import any streamed audio. Yeah, two and a half megabytes. And we can still compress a fair bit of this. So... There are things we can do to fix it or to not run into the limit. And it's not even really a hard limit, but we're going to treat it as a hard limit. Ctrl-H is what you need? Nope. It used to just work to highlight whatever I picked. But I think they updated Notepad, and they removed that. The Mark tab. That's fucked up that you have to do that now. How do I unmark it? Yeah, basically, I don't. Give me your marks. Okay. Why did it used to work and now it doesn't work anymore? Or am I gaslighting myself? You know what, I'm feeling like we should do a side level. One that fits somewhere. Let's audit the vibe. Why not just do this in VS Code? Because I already have my ROM egg open in VS Code and I don't want two VS Codes open. So we're gonna make it so that if you jump on all of these without touching the floor, you're gonna get a blue coin. Just for the fun of it. It was so fun in Zelda. Games need to do that more. It's like when you for fun only step on the squares when you walk on the path in real life. Everyone does that at some point. Hello, Biomech. We're currently thinking about how to fill this up. And I think it might be time for me to do one of the bonus side levels next. We're definitely gonna fill this up with some Yoshis. There's going to be Yoshis living here. But I think I want to limit the amount of Yoshis living here before you get the second Bowser level. Where do you put all the stars? We have now placed around... Probably like 120 stars, I would say. These river Yoshis? It's like Yoshis just floating in the river. I was also thinking we should add the back entrance to Course 2 somewhere. The dojo was also going to have a secret star. Remember, one of the side levels here was with the Yoshi. Who keeps trying to get better at jumping, I think. And he keeps jumping further and further. Once you have enough stars, you can talk to him and he will challenge you to a race in the sky on rainbows. The egg looks breakable. Will it break? It does indeed look breakable. But it currently does not break. Okay, watch me. You can't lose your head in the game, though. I have not worked on any moving blocks. Hello, Asgore. So there are being ruins and temples, alluding to a far more advanced Yoshi region, but no. They live in leaf-topped huts. Yeah, it's kind of fun. There's also this part of the overworld here. Which is where Bowser has his theme park over here. And this will be the Bomb Cat Factory. I think this area will be fun. We just put some Bob-ombs over here, we put the Womp there. This is like a grimy enemy area, basically. And then over here you can open those blocks. I think you haven't even seen this biome, I can't feel it. Ah, fuck! What the hell? And now it's full of ghosts. Wow! Wow! You can't die in the overworld? I haven't figured out what happens yet. And there's the stuff for this. Wow! This is half-snow-coated. Very spooky secret level. I'm a little worried that this area here has the same identity as the former area. I wanted this to feel like basically this is the center of the Yoshi civilization. Along with the next area. And it kind of doesn't really feel like anything. You can look at those from the box? No, they're permanent. You've cursed the land, and now they're there. This is going to be the Melon Farm. Maybe this should be more like... Like this is the public place where the Yoshis hang out. And then this should be Yoshi City? I don't know, how would this work? Public square? And the place where they all sleep? So at first there should probably be a Yoshi here that just... He's like a hater to start, like oh thank you for freeing me, but so many of my brethren are still in Bowser's plans. Hello, Woofoo. Make it into a marketplace, a Yoshi marketplace. This area here? Could kind of work. Have I been a long, young Yoshi? I can look it up again. Let me see. What would it say? Conspiracy Theory Yoshi? Yeah, we know what he looks like. Let's see what it was. Did I not write this down anywhere? Huh? Let's see. Okay, that's the idea. What's the idea? Yes, Exeter. But yeah, I'm not happy with the visual or the identity of these two places. They feel very similar right now. I mean this is fine, this is like Mountain Village, Mushroom Village. And this will be like Melon's, but this is like nothing. We need a bridge here. Let me put a bridge there. Okay. Ow. It's a neat idea, but a little contrived. Also, I really don't want Mario to get the Wing Cap in the overworld. Like, all our culling just goes out the window. I think that could break the illusion pretty quickly. Okay. That bridge changes everything. We need Yoshi architecture. Hello, EizaEasy. Eiza, I'm very close to implementing, maybe implementing your level here. I'm still not sure if I'm supposed to implement it or not. If it was done or not. What were the rice fields in this area, since there's Japanese architecture? Where would it be? Yeah, you remember the level you made, Eiza? But if this is going to be in the game, because like, I didn't think it was done. Rice fields? Okay, one second. Wait a second. You mentioned rice fields. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me see if I can find a good screenshot. Your... Ah, I thought Marty had planned rice fields. He has a level like this, that's like about going up in the tower here. It looks awesome. I thought maybe that would fit as the side level here. Honestly, I haven't looked at it in a while either, Eiza. So I'm not entirely sure. Yeah, it does look awesome, that side level. It's put so much work into it. When the game releases, all hell will break loose. Wait, rice fields. Oh wait, this is what they would look like. So then the quick rough concept art? Nope. Oh, so this is the idea? Like Yoshi's just sit here with the markets? A Yoshi flea market! Oh. As in there's always a flea market on Yoshi's Island? The fuzzy market. Honestly, I like it. Maybe the lake idea is just not great then. I love flea markets too. Dude, where I used to live, like once a year, there was a flea market that was literally like 3 or 4 miles long. Imagine just 3 or 4 miles of people selling their old shit. It was so cool. I like the lake though. The lake is pretty cool actually. I think we just need to add more Yoshi architecture to the lake here. Make this look more like the Yoshis cultivated this area. And like this is where they intentionally live. So this is like the heart of the island basically. You're a Bionicle fan? Is that why your name is Biopack? I used to play with Bionicle too. I watched I think the first Bionicle movie in theatre. I don't know. I might give you the sad truth though. I think flea markets are kind of fell off. Because like nowadays, everyone's a collector. Everyone's a nerd. Everyone's charging real prices for everything. It's unlikely that you find something underpriced. So it's like why even go to a flea market? I guess there's still a lot of cool shit to see, but still. They kind of ruin flea markets. Do they have like 50 of them? Dang. I gave all mine away. Or maybe I sold them all. I always sold my old toys. I have the ones that go like... You know exactly what I'm talking about. And I add the other ones to the tall guys. I wonder if the Sultan is trying to sell you a scam cap. No? It's the Yoshis, the good guys. Dude, I remember seeing this. I thought these were like prehistoric Bionicles that only old people have. I'll show you which ones I have. Yeah, these are the fucking prehistoric ones. I didn't have those. The skinny weeny Bionicles. I think I had these guys here. Something like that. Not quite those. I thought mine looked a little bulkier. You had Borax? I know I had those too. The ones with the teeth. Yeah, I had some of those, but not just those. Toa Nuva, yes, that sounds correct. Yeah, these guys. Toa Metru, maybe? No, I didn't have those. Your song request? Oh, there was a song request? I didn't realize. Yeah. It's the proper way to play with Bionicles to just make shit up. You just kind of treat them like action figures that you can build around. Because that's what we did. Visorak? Let me see that. These do look cool. I feel like I had one of those. Now that you mention it, I'm 100% certain I had one of those. Oh yeah, I know they have some sane lore. Your friends have your old Bionicle? Hello, Badoop. Welcome to us turning this more into a Yoshi city. Currently it's not city-like enough. It has no identity. This needs to be something. Right now this is just... Get them as well. Nice. Are Bionicles still super popular like they were back when we were kids? They feel like a thing that could have been really huge. GameLego is not doing Lego themes anymore, am I right? Oh, Bionicles Lego? That makes sense. Hello, Graeme. Is this like Polynesians or something for removing their cultural heritage in Bionicle? The gang's all here. The gang's all here? Who said that? Oh, Sonic the Hedgehog. Thank you. Oh, did it stop? I've pictured the space under your bed. That's pretty cool. Is that a helicopter? There's no way Bionicles have a helicopter, right? No, that's just Lego technique. The French Bionicles. Do you evolve the water more if you're going to keep the lake? Hmm, maybe? Manage shell fracturing? I'm never 100% sure when people say shell fracturing what they really mean. Do you mean multiple triangles on top of each other with a transparent texture? Because that's one of the most expensive things you could do on the N64. But it certainly can do it, technically. We need more architecture here. Are these a lot that expensive? $75? Oh, okay. $90. Why are you streaming on your second channel? Do you want to keep it low-key with the viewers? If you stream on the main channel, the chat is going to be a shitshow and it's going to be unusable. Is there a Japanese house on the island? That's a dojo. That's where the old Yoshi man lives. I guess. Ah, the bridges make it feel so much nicer. Yahoo! We need more architecture. More things that we can put here. That make it feel like the Yojis intentionally live here and not somewhere else. Fencing? How about fencing? I like the idea of the rice fields, too. Yahoo! Bamboo fence? Are you saying the building style of the house is wrong, Biobank? I don't know. I guess dojo just made me think of Japanese houses. Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! I just grabbed one meal so I can get here faster. Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! What if the Yoshis were growing some kind of crop around here? Around the ledge? That could be the rice field. Could we turn this into just some of the... Would the Yoshis grow rice, though? Turn this into a crop field. I like that idea. Boo! It auto-played into Mario 64! No! No! Make her a Yoshi? Fair enough. Okay, let's take a look. What do rice plants look like? Yeah, I imagine these are a lot more powerful. We could have lily pantology in the water, for sure. So, would we just make rows of rice, maybe? I think that might just be the most efficient way to render the rice field here. And we need a clear separation. Let's make one here. Hmm. Let me think about how to best do this. Maybe we don't need... I don't see two fruits. I don't understand. Non-solid rectangles? Would that look good, though? Let me look into my plant folder. I hate the overdrive. I'm not using the overdrive. It doesn't work. I am using the summer code. Oh. Nah, we don't want to reference Galaxy 2 like that. We want to stick to the N64 era. Cherry Blossom Tree. Okay, we don't want to go full weeaboo here. There's a dojo. I get it. More like the neverdrive. Fucking got him. But no, I do not want to spread hate like that about the overdrive. I have personal issues with it, and I don't want you guys to copy-paste my opinion on this. Dude, this is actually my eternal struggle. There are so many things I hate, and I want to hate on them. But every time I hate on a thing, I feel like I'm spreading hate. And I don't want to spread hate. I just want to hate on a thing. I'm just too much of a trendsetter. I don't want people to copy-paste my ideas, so you're a... Wait. Is this referencing something? I want something like this. Oh. Oh, he's copying my idea. Oh, I see. I see, I see, I see. This is not what rice plants look like, right? This is what weeds look like. Okay, that's a little extreme. You have a personal connection to them. Okay, I don't do a venting like that. Which is ground strength? Yeah, that also sounds reasonable. But let me try lines of rice first. Okay, fuck it, let's use this texture. How do I not completely fuck this up? Where is addition? There we go. Where is offset? Oh my god, why is there no search function? No. Space. I didn't do shit. Fuck it. I'm googling it. I'm googling it. Layer transform offset? No. No. How do I offset? Using the offset tool? Goat it. Okay. So can I use lighten only? We've got our seamless grass. The chat GPT actually is great if you just want to google something and google is being annoying. That is the one use case. Don't hang me. Don't tell anyone on Twitter I said that. They will have my hat on a pike. And it's fucked up. Okay, cool. Cool. Is this even going to look good? Probably not. Supposed to have a black background? Yes. Need to up the max brightness a little bit. Without necessarily getting the bottom to be full black. Okay. Let's try it. Don't say that cream team. I don't want my career to be over just yet. I don't want my career to be over just yet. I don't want my career to be over just yet. Okay. Okay. Okay. Dianox extended 8 hours? Fuck you, Ryan. It was 15 minutes. Something is wrong. This is rotated the wrong way. It's still full black. That has to be a first 64 bug. Yep, as soon as I recreate the shader nodes, it's just fine. Okay, cool. Yep, as soon as I recreate the shader nodes, it's just fine. Okay, cool. Yep, as soon as I recreate the shader nodes, it's just fine. Okay, cool. Yep, as soon as I recreate the shader nodes, it's just fine. Okay, cool. I mean, it's not awful. I mean, it's not awful. I mean, it's not awful. Very bad gangbang video called Dire Dire Licks. That would be like a leaked speedrunner porn tape. That would be like a leaked speedrunner porn tape. It honestly looks kinda nice. Kinda like the visual of it. What other Yoshi architecture would fit? There would be like... There would be like... There would be like... 1900... There would be like... 1900... 0... There would be like... 1900... 0... late 1800s type architecture. late 1800s type architecture. Primitive stuff. Maybe even before that. An aqueduct? No. Sonic. Sonic. Sonic. Sonic. Sonic. Sonic. Sonic. Sonic. Sonic. Sonic. Sonic. Sonic. Oh, we have Sonic. You just haven't paid enough attention. I know at least one. Hydration check? Let's hydrate. Roger, count, nothing speedrunner? No, not Roger. I don't think he's a speedrunner. Wooden dock on the lake? Hmm. I had a dock before. It looked really terrible. Let's see. Let's see. Medieval harbour town or medieval farm lake? Let's see what we find. What? Is speedrunner getting late? No, it was actually just him. Yes, Noroboro. Believe it or not, we don't start with the finished version. We start with an unfinished version and then slowly finish it. I don't want to think of the implications of a tool-assisted getting late speedrun. Actually, start with an unworked. Actually, you start when you get born. Actually, you start by installing your tool. Oh, I would like this. Yeah, what if there was like a wooden... Okay, I see. See, when you say dock, I always think like a piece of wood that goes out. But what if there was like a piece of wood that goes around the corner? That would be so much cooler, no? Like a piece of wood that's like a half circle here? Ooh, that would look cool. Bro, I heard recently that people are using LLM to write messages to their significant other if their significant other is upset. And that's so crazy. It's like, you lost your humanity. That's just demonic. That's genuinely like sociopath behavior. I find. I imagine people that do that have like their girlfriend snorted on their phone just under the name Hole. You know what I mean? Yeah. What? Oh, it changed to view mode. Okay, that makes sense. Okay, that makes sense. You hate AI so much. Fair. LLM girlfriend offered himself and the parents were talking about how to start a life. And then at the end that I was actually wrote such a lovely eulogy for him. Okay, you know what? This is this is my hot take for the day. I think an AI doctor actually has a huge potential. Every doctor I went to fucking sucked. AI has a lot more time for you than a doctor. And it has it has the capacity. If you don't do just a fucking stupid LLM, if you have like a proper AI that is trained to be a doctor, has the capacity to be better because humans have a lot of biases. So I think that actually could save a lot of lives and improve a lot of people lives. Transparency. It's the overdraw. It's expensive. Crazy take. I mean, you have to think about this. So think about this. I had a fucked up elbow. My elbow sucked. It was awful. I didn't know what to do about my elbow. I went to a doctor in a walker clinic. First of all, I had to sit there for two and a half hours before I got called. And then when I was there, the doctor talked to me for five minutes. And he said, there are solutions. He didn't tell me what the solutions are, even when I asked. And then he said, if you want, we can inject cortisol into your elbow or steroids. Maybe the cortisol was a steroid. I don't remember. And he said, well, if it doesn't get better, come back in two weeks. It's like, as if I'm going to come back in two weeks to sit there for another three hours just to be told to basically fuck off. So what I did is I went home. I did research into it. I looked what could possibly be causing this. This was before AI was a thing. So I had to do all it myself. I spent a good bit of time into it. And I figured out that I can do physiotherapy. Which, of course, I had no health insurance at the time. So I just looked at how to do that. And I kind of did it. And it fixed my elbow. Imagine someone who wasn't able to do all that research or who wasn't willing to spend like, what, six, seven hours figuring out what to do. They'd just be fucked. Or they'd just be taking the cortisol shots. So in that sense, if there was an AI made specifically to diagnose issues, specifically to diagnose issues, not a stupid LLM, like an actual, real, decent thing, not just some stupid psychophant that just agrees with you and everything. I think that would improve people's lives. That is retarded and you're retarded. What? I think the doctor is using Chagrin also so you can cut out the middleman. I guess that's true in the modern time. Yeah. Yeah. People like to cite how much water AI takes. But for me to really take that as a serious concern, then I also want people to know how much water a kilogram of meat takes. Put a wild guess. How much water do you need to produce a kilogram of meat? Without looking it up. Give me guesses. And someone write how much water AI takes per prompt. Just so we have a comparison. Comparison. Where are you from? Germany. 400 liters? That's a lot. 10,000 liters? A bajillion liters? Oh, that's crazy. Sigh. Oh, that sucks. I guess an optimist could say, oh, but back in the day people were saying you shouldn't be using books. You should memorize everything. Using books is cheating. But this does feel a little different. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So I think because of that, the water consumption aspect is a little overblown. When you first read how much water an AI takes, it sounds like a crazy amount. But then when you compare it to other things, it really isn't that much. I think people just like the sense of scale of our industrialized world. And how much goes into everything. It's 256 by 32. Yoshi, somewhere to play music? What? It's between 7,000 and 15,000 liters. That's a crazy amount. We're way off. Wait, I didn't see your guess. Let's see. It's for two years and there's only 700 liters? Yeah, you were off by a factor of 10. Still, 700 liters is not a bad guess. Wait, the meat? I mentioned the amount of meat I eat in every single second. I mean, what's the total amount of water consumption when you just put them right next to each other currently in the world? I actually have no idea. The meat is from being one of the world's biggest producers of wellnour. That's true. That's true. Maybe this is whataboutism, what I'm doing, where I'm saying, yes, this thing is bad, but this other thing is 10 times worse, so why are we talking about this? I'm not vegan either, but if I could press a button to force everyone to be vegan, I might do it. Actually, who am I lying to? If I had a button like that, I would fucking blackmail the entire world. I'd be like, send me a billion while I'm pressing the button. Second, my controller is all tied up here. You would get killed in seven seconds by the meat industry. I only need one to press the button. This texture sucks, too. Did I just kill my preset? I did. Do you enable it outside of grog servers that I immediately felt the effects of though? Oh. Huh. Okay. I think I need to add a subdivision here so that this is less awfully UV-mapped. Or I could... I got nervous. Never mind. Okay. Okay. Consume as much as a small city? That honestly sounds like a lot less than I thought they would. I thought they were using a lot more than that. Okay, 100 decibels of background noise is fucking insane and there should be a law against that. But I guess they are Google and Meta so the law doesn't really apply. Why would they build that shit next to a town though? That's like just bullying the people. Why would you do that? Okay. That looks awful. Alright, let's just go with this. Looks a bit too processed. Maybe? I honestly prefer it when it looks like this. Okay, that makes a lot more sense. Okay. Hello, what is up my dude? Sorry, I didn't see who wrote that. Give me a second for it to pop up. Wait, this is not gonna pop up on stream. No, I will never know who donated that. But thank you. Shit, what happened? Okay. Go to the other side from the dock so that Yoshi can walk over to the other side of the river. We have a thing here. But yeah, we're adding more. Don't worry. What's your name bro? Thank you for the sub, I think. My dude. God, I'm such a bad streamer. Chat, would you still love me if I was a worm? I was just thinking about that thing. Is there any respect as far as the nuclear energy? I remember being in like 4th or 5th grade and all my classmates were like we need to get rid of nuclear energy, it's so bad for the environment. And I was like that sounds like the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Just because one bad thing happened, that's irrational. But it looks like that's exactly what we ended up doing. So I think it's just Germany that's fucked in regards to nuclear energy. I think France is actually doing really well with it, right? I don't know if this is true, but I've heard that um what are they called? Coal coal or energy plants actually produce more radiation than nuclear power plants because nuclear power plants have stricter regulations. Which would be crazy if true. I might have done that. Currently I have an editor on it. I have to ask him for progress on it actually. That depends on how big the fines are, right? Bro, what if I became a politics streamer? That actually sounds like an awful idea. I don't think I want that. I kind of like how the wood curves here. The way the wood curves is beautiful. I want to keep that. What? You want to be a grifter? That's the thing. I don't want to be a grifter. So I wouldn't be a successful politics streamer. I don't want to be a politics streamer. Oh! Is that why you can't eat too much tuna? Because of coal powered energy plants? I'm going to be pissed if that's true. The medical service on this island? The medical service on this island is a shaman that looks at your wound and goes And then he puts rotting Goomba meat onto you and blows on it. Okay. Do you get autism? No. In Boston. You wanted a tiny bridge between those two piers? Yeah, but I wanted two piers. Okay, it's starting to feel like something. What if I made a fence around here? Around the rise area. Just a primitive one. The holes in the bridges is just a Kurdish map right now. Don't worry about it. A little boat next to the pagoda? Eh? Okay. What type of content I will make once the game is done? Feed pics. Will you be able to hire any requests? Yes, but I am selective with the requests I take because I get so many and it will be expensive. So, how are you- These little pots. What the fuck? This is a game. Where's the lake? Is this Skyrim? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Koi fish swimming around? Oh man, I love koi fish. That would be so cool. But I don't want to go full weeb here. Okay, let's see. Primitive town near the lake. Why is there just a random woman here? Why is there just a random woman here? Hell, what's the idea? I'm going to do a YouTube video if I'm interested in playing this game when the time comes, by the way. There's an application form. You can use that. So, okay, I actually- Let me show you. Let me show you. Let me show you. So, for testing. On the milestone tracker, you can see we already 100%ed many tests for many levels. Currently, next I want to do Lofty Lumber Leaves here. Some of these are at 50% because we haven't gotten the rework yet. But I assume these will jump to 100% right after. So, for these last five levels, I will still need testers. Probably like 15 testers or so. And then I had a test of the entirety of Overworld 1 recently. And that will need a tester at some point with Overworld 1 and 2 in there. But that's the thing that I can probably only send to people IRL. And then after all of this is done, we move to phase two, which is gameplay testing. And this will be a little more open with more people. So, I don't know what I'm going to do for that yet. But I might do like a new call for it. I'm doing well, Ratchet. I'm not honoring any heritage, I don't... The problem is that what would need to be compressed is sound. And that's just not a thing that we can really compress without serious performance downsides. Because right now it's on RSP. Let's see if you find some good fencing. Is there your last big ROM hack? I wouldn't say I'm planning for that. But there is a good chance it will be. A rock wall? That doesn't really feel like architecture. I don't know. Don't we already have fencing? I should just use this. What about your idea? Oh. Wait. The Mario equivalent of Koi called Azumis, because Koi Azumi is the 3D Mario guy? No idea. I don't think I understand. You want the fish that's called Azumi that looks like a Koi? Because Koi Azumi is a guy that exists? Is that what I'm gathering here? The guy's called Yoshiaki Koi Azumi? Oh, I see. Hmm. I do like the idea of having fish underwater. They just feel very good to me. But we have a fish that looks like a Koi, right? I don't know. They just feel very good to me. But we have a fish net in front of here then, so that the fish don't leave. Okay, I like this now. Let's just do that. Maybe that could be the way to enter one of the side levels with the fishing minigame. We have entered 3 frames per second blender mode. Luigi is currently in the game, Kaki-Def. But he doesn't do anything yet. I haven't added multiplayer yet. I probably will. But before that, I want to finish my rewrite of all the Mario 64 codes. Okay, so I like the idea of there being fish here. But we need a net to keep the fish in. And I also want the fish to do something. What do we do with the fish? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What do we do with the fish? It should open one of the side levels. You already get to Aza's side levels on the manta ray here. And you can get to the rainbow slide using the athlete Yoshi. Let's see. There's a clue, smgm. But we still won't stick to 64 megabytes. Because going beyond that is kinda lame. But they couldn't back in the day. Back the fish into Yoshi. What do you call it? Fish in? When you out in the fish? When you out the fish in? That's true, it should be called fish outing. Instead of fish inning. It already does Kaki. Okay, let's say we have fish here. And maybe there is a Yoshi fisherman. And if you bring him a big fish, he lets you into his house. And that's where the light and dark level is. He could be like, oh yeah, I'm going to bring a big fish. He could be like, oh yeah, that's a great fish. If you want, you can go into my shed and find the star. I'll trade you for it. And then you go into the shed and that's the light and dark level. How's that sound? I like Mario's level a bit better here. Yeah, it could also fit great. Where would the entrance be? How are you thinking the level would be entered? Figure at large. Right, but why would you be allowed to enter the level? Do you have to drop a fish off as a tribute? Where's Marty? He's someone who made a side level for this game. The level looks great. It's not 100% finished yet. But I can show you some screenshots. It's got towers like this. And this is an aerial view with like a little garden. Another view. And this is a big overview. It is cool AF. Actually, an entrance here would make sense. Because then that makes the most sense that it's part of the island. I don't even know how you would catch a fish, to be honest. How does that even make sense? What are the fish around in the water? They lead you to a hidden area that opens the gate and leads you to the level. There was an idea for a shell diving race against the shark. Where you'd be using the shell to swim fast. And you make a race against the shark. That might just be a better fit for that. The shell is the key to the great treasure. That's true. I will not cocky. Yeah, that's a good way to do the hints. The problem is, there just isn't enough area here to really do something like that. Unless the fish started spawning the manta rings or something like that. Yes, cocky. Hidden behind seaweeds. Yeah, we could just put a hole in here that you normally can't go through. Unless you follow a fish. I guess that would work. Hit me here. Okay, fuck it, let's do it. That has to be the shark race though, right? Nothing but the shark race fits. That is also true. That is also true. Oh, fine, let's put my designer here. I guess that also makes a little more sense size-wise. How did you formulate it? I don't know. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely. We can have them swim all over the place. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What are you talking about, cocky, huh? You wanna get into a fight? Yeah. Biki bar is planned for over here, maybe. Well, it makes more sense to have the fish escape so they can always see me. No, I don't like the idea that there's like a Yoshi inflicting cruelty upon the fish. That the fish would have to escape from. Yeah. So we'd have a path like this and we're going to block it with seaweed. And then we have to put a lot more seaweed here to kind of hide it a little bit. And I think that should work. Yeah. Why do you want to prevent the fish from escaping? I don't know where you read that. Oh. Actually, yeah, fair point. I wanted to stop the fish from swimming out into the ocean here. But maybe we don't need that. Maybe the fish just stay here because they like it. I don't know. Maybe because they wear an F3. I don't think I contributed anything to it. Anyway. We got that. That's another level entrance down. Perfect. I have a little bit of a boring guess. Are people going to be disappointed that there's more side-level entrances than main-level entrances? Will they be like, ah, this sucks, another side-level, I'm going to have to find a main-level. Or will they be like, yippee, I found another secret! You think it's yippee? Can we be happy to find levels? Okay, that's good. I think so too, but I think it's a worry that is worth to keep in mind. The main-levels are typically more obvious. Will the side-levels have their own songs? Some of them, yes, but not all of them, I think. I mean, I'm sure Badoo will be up for composing them, but I'm not sure how many less Zero World can actually import in-game at this point. I feel like we're a little bit bottlenecked on that part. Okay, I need more Yoshi architecture, actually. You got the idea in the intro? Your next video, tell people that whoever subscribes to your Patreon whenever you make the credits sequence will be added to the thank you section. But don't tell them when that will be, so feel more appreciative to stay subscribed and release true evil thinking. Tide pools? What is a tide pool? Come to think of it, I gotta add traps to this part. What is a tide pool? Oh no, I wasn't gonna do that. There should be more fruit trees here. I feel like that's missing. Trees that are just full of fruit. Imagine a tree growing over the lake here and from here. I think if we did that, that would add a lot. And then you could even walk onto the trees. You think fruit trees are false idols? No! Christians have pictures of Jesus everywhere and the cross too. It wouldn't make sense for that to be a false idol. This is the real idol. Beyond the tree. Would there be any architecture around the trees that they get their food from? Maybe, maybe not. I feel like I want one tree here, so let me expand the land a little bit here. One on the pagoda island, one over here. And... I want one over here somehow, but I don't actually see how that would work. One on the pagoda island, one next to the bridge. I can't put one here, because that's going to mess with the platforming. I think that just has to be it. Baskets? Oh yeah, baskets! Let me write that down too. It could be filled with fruit. I'm not sold on this area here. What is the point of it? It doesn't give this area a point. Let's trim the proverbial fats and... ...fill this area. Let's trim the proverbial fats and... ...fill this area. Let's trim the proverbial fats and... ...fill this area. Let's trim the proverbial fats and... ...fill this area. Let's trim the proverbial fats and... ...fill this area. No case placeness. There's still a little area with nothing in it. Is this not fine? It's smaller. I don't need it to have a justification in the world. I just need it to have a justification for game design purposes. Yes, SLX. If you're going to use this in any form of entertainment, the fishies. Yeah, you're only like the sixth person to ask that today, Cloudbombs. You can check the progress tracker. I have a progress tracker. Look right here in the master. Look, these are all at 100%. This one's at 9%. Actually, this one's at 100% now. I don't know why this is saying 99%. You see that? This one's also at 100%. That's true. R64 has a lot of that. Although in R64 I find a lot of the time the useless areas give you a sense of geometry. But look, isn't this peak useless area that does nothing? That's true. That is a good idea. I should add it to the stream description. Okay, so the fruit baskets are going to add a lot of architectural feeling to this. Makes it more intentional. Then we have a big tree over there. You will be able to maybe jump onto the big tree from here. That's going to be cool. And then there's going to be a big tree over there. And you will be able to jump over that from here. Which is also going to be very cool. Not sure what to do about the egg yet. Maybe just remove it. It's like geometry to you? What does that mean? I hope I don't get the net making as one of my sins, I don't judge you. Oh, that would be such a Kaizo hack, how's that? That actually is a banger idea. Mario64, but I removed every triangle that is not touched by the world record speedrun. Just to give people a sense of how insane the speedrun is. There was one thing I urgently wanted to do just now. Alright, fix this. Is this the Smash Ultimate soundtrack? I don't know. What other things might the Yoshi's be engaging in? Well, they are primitive creatures. They only collect fruits and build huts. And then they get enslaved by Bowser and they do manual labor. So, not much I would say. Anyway, now we know. Baskets and trees is what we're going to do next. To make progress on this area. But yeah, it's already starting to have an identity. That's good. It sucked before. That will be it for today. And I will see you guys in the next stream. I don't think there will be one tomorrow, but there's definitely going to be one on Tuesday. Unless something horrible happens to me. If I don't stream on Tuesday, just assume I'm dead. Until then, bye bye.
