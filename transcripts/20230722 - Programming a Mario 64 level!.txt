You You Oh Oh Hello, hey, I think we did it hello Leela So I kind of did this and like the last week or so Did I really love how the shadows look it looks so cool Dude this was supposed to be climbable. I Walked around I'm working on it. I'm actually just working on one room. Yeah, she's she's doing some things Hey, this is set to not slippery, why did I slide? That is weird. Maybe I just didn't save it yet Could this run on n64? I haven't tried but this is a lot less expensive than some of the other levels I've made so I don't see why not this should work just fine You guys like the music too Okay, if you guys really want we can test this on real hardware right now Able to look straight up or straight down straight up and straight down All right guys fine n64 test of this Oh So the OST for this is literally AI generated Lofi And I think it fits really well you wouldn't even be able to tell that this is AI generated FPS Testo Laureum Sure, sure, buddy, whatever you say, yeah, it's AI generated There's a whole music channel that just AI generates music Greetings from Guatemala, isn't that? Oh No, wait, I'm I'm confusing that with I'm Guantanamo Bay. I Was like, oh, isn't that the FBI torch island? I'm sorry. You have to stay there, bro Yeah, not too unexpected that something like this would happen probably fixable Is you to the 8b8 and pH That's a weird point to have a floating exception it'd be free for oh wait 8b, okay So there is a crash in this function here on n64 only Should be pretty easy to fix You Know what I can actually just find the exact line of code Let's fix that real quick and then we test it again on n64. How about that? More f2 f0 f2 Sure I definitely know a lot more about the n64 to Nintendo ever did It's not even that difficult to do because you know, it's been a long while I Should probably check if this broken on enjoy too. It's not this function only exists in a sec this is the function that shapes the background here and The fact I'm getting a float exception here F2 is undefined F2 is loaded from 0 0 4 from V 1 What is V 1 here It's your 2f is your 1c It's your 2fa It's the color table So something in this color table is just not being read correct I Guess what's happening? I know that doesn't make sense 4 from V 1 Huh Have you ever thought about writing a n64 emulator? Nope Concerning hope someone's looking into a true Well now bigger marks, you know heck can really get if I can we do anything get to issues like FPS and crashing You can make it infinitely big. I actually had this idea for a Romic where we'd have like an infinite Generated map from like a seat kind of like how minecraft does it? But I can't think of anything to put in there that would actually make it fun to play that's the issue I'm missing that I had an open world engine a while ago But what I'm talking about is different the open world engine just loaded in in chunks That's a bit lame Ah Project 64 gang who's with me To F a 0 1 C is where it loads to wait Be a 8 be 8 right here If 2 is undefined 0 is Is it supposed to increment V 1 here is that how it works I Don't know what Daggerfall is But I mean, obviously you can make like a huge map. That's like infinitely generated, right? That's not even difficult. The difficult part is making it fun Honestly, if anyone has a good idea for what to put into it, I am up for giving it a try However, I don't I'll add a V 1 T to a 0 T 2 0 a 0 is What the fuck is a 0 Huh How is a 0 this big oh Wait, we want to spend calculate from this. Okay makes sense I Also, not 8 from V 1 do we load 0 from V 1 anyway, right? We have 8 from V 1 We load twice the exact same number oh Wait, we loaded once normal and then once with the offset. Oh I see Index and index plus one and Same here Where do we load 0 from V 1 Okay, guys we actually need an OST before I get lost in this this shouldn't be difficult to fix but you know Most likely it's just having a wrong offset See my 0-1 that actually looks good to me I Don't want pizza tower it was giving me shoddy solutions in the comments the other day. Hey is you Madness combat OST. Okay. Let's do that. I have no idea what that is This looks very cursed I Okay, but I'm actually not gonna deal with this today we actually want to look at return to Yoshi's Island today It's just a duck dance the duck song no, that's chicken song cooked up fam music true Dude Dude but dude finally wrote me again today. He's back and he's making music again. He said he was looking into a song for this level I Haven't gotten a preview yet But he said he's been working on it for a week and he said like 10 different tries and he just can't figure out how To make a good But he's really putting in the effort, which is really really good for us Okay, it's what if I just took Mars 64 and put it like bomb on battlefield with all of Mars physics to unreal engine Just to fuck with everyone Nintendo would hire you true Okay, we did the seesaw last time Let me just make sure that all works fine And then it's exported once. I always didn't beginning to make sure I didn't fuck anything up and then we start Unreal plus lip essence for not even that hard why even lip sm64 just like copy paste the code. I Don't know about lip sm64 even I would just take Mario's code ctrl C ctrl V And then I'd give Mario's a material that's a shader that's doing all the matrix animations That would be super optimized to an unreal engine not that it's necessary, but you know Unreal engine is all C++ and I think most secret just compiles a C++. So But I'm literally a professional unreal engine developer, so Right, we were working on the womps next I imported these off stream We're gonna need one animations, but we need to decide what to do with the womps first Hello, Marinova No You should drop one, oh my god, that is so funny. I will make him drop one coin. That is such a funny idea I What is this sp-28 thing here Third argument third argument this p30 coin unknown 1 1 0 Oh What the fuck oh That's the random velocity range Well, it seems to always be 20.5 so That seems a little bit unnecessary For the good saying your eyes and womps true Still not a huge fan of the camera being the light source. I think it just looks way better in this game It was way too dark before. Oh Basically I changed the way the lighting nodes work There's no also like a brightness modifier That I can just turn up to make the whole level brighter because I noticed the levels were being way too dark No coin Yeah, you need that it's a bit of a silly system, but it works It's just not how light works in real life I Mean Okay, yes, but Video game graphics are all about faking everything Nothing that we do is how light works in real life You Could make the same argument for gravity if you look at gravity Mario's gravity is way too high Realistically, he'd fall like maybe half as fast not even I think that looked good. It was hard to see because I did a stupid thing. I Mean there's Mario 64, but it's unnecessarily realistic if you want that That looks amazing, okay guys, so I have this issue here there's womps here right and you mess with the womps The one thing I'm not sure about it's like what do the womps even do Originally, I was just gonna have them have like a metal beam that they carry forward But like what do they carry it to do they just throw it into the water Well, yeah, they're gonna fall like dominoes. You're just gonna kick them over and they're all gonna fall I think you're gonna have to kick one of them into the face. Ah, I think making it So you have to kick them in the face is a bit Too Runs arrested someone does it from behind and it doesn't work You could be waiting to be used as a building material, oh, okay. Yeah That's a funny idea So what they all say that when you talk to them like, oh I can't be I can't wait to be used in a building Or more like buzz off. I'm patiently waiting my turn to be put into a building something like that You're gonna break my concentration Do you not have infinite widescreen carrying on em, you I do not It just makes developing more difficult to have that with no benefits, so why would I The extra to cleanly make out of homes at the end of power and the climax of them is falling is breaking structure So They're building something here they're like building a tower and there's just gonna be a tower made out of lumps I Like that So I'm gonna put a warm tower here and you break it and then Let's say the one towers like at the very end and that just kind of falls into the water with a splash Now that's really cool that is such a funny idea I Have the one concern that maybe there's a bit too many ones to render them properly, but let's see You Have all the funny ideas tonight. Hey, that's actually one of the benefits of streaming. Sometimes that one is just a really funny idea Dude I also I think there's like a huge thing we can do look I actually Started optimizing the game for ROM size because we're at a point where we have to optimize the game for ROM size So I removed all the Mario 64 backgrounds But I noticed the thing and that is in the samples. There are a few instruments. We have I've got this is the build in the samples here There are a few instruments. We have to like so big you see that 17 seconds. I Need to be this big So we're probably gonna cut these sound effects a little bit give actually what frequency are they 44,000 All of these are 44,000. So yeah They're definitely gonna be a lot smaller. We're gonna save like half a megabyte of ROM size, which is very good What is it that was the sound for when you're inside the ship in course five Like creaking wood Well, I have to optimize for ROM size because the bait the smaller the ROM is The more space we're gonna for mp3 files And if we have or not everything that's more like WAV files and every time we use a WAV file instead of a song We save a lot of performance in that level. So all big areas have to use streamed audio Chris 5 is a big boos on it's not In this game here Do they have arms and legs when they're in a building, how do we do that? I Don't know if that's even possible better, but you could just say that is possible But it's a lot worse because when you do that We need to add the code to generate that white noise to the audio codes And then there's like extra code that's gonna screw up the cache It's not gonna be a whole millisecond, but you know I Think so, too Although they might look a bit Tell what's next and I'm sticking out at random. Yeah. Yeah I Should probably simplify a stream into two. Oh, no, we have a big rainstorm again No, it's way too warm Okay, and the rainstorm was so bad cause a lot of flooding yeah, we actually had a lot of flooding Yesterday I It's not as bad as it was last night, no, of course not lots of thunderstorms, too It's probably still warm because I still need to make an armature why do I need an armature Thank you for having rain to be honest Like a record-breaking wildfire to a record-breaking thunderstorm Yeah, lucky for having rain Lucky we're having rain, bro. I'm so glad They need animations the tower doesn't need animations they're being good little bricks I Think that's just one of the high the highways that's nearby. I Sent it on this board for you. All right, let me see that Yeah The walking lumps, yeah, they have far much less I guess is Anna you can do those already if you want Yeah, all right send them over with a list of animations you want They just need like an idle standing animation and the tipping over animation For what's You should reuse the side text on the back of the one for helmets Yeah, that's actually a good idea Right, I'll make that one change and then I'll send it to you So Some helmets shouldn't have the back texture because they have helmets and this can't break Well, I'm not too worried about that I was just thinking you can't see them anyway I think they actually should have that texture like if it was visible just so Players know a these are normal moms and the funny thing is that they're wearing helmets so you can't break them But since the texture is not visible anyway We can save a little bit of performance doing it this way Like if it was visible I would have to touch on there All right, there you go one is idle two is falling over forwards Okay Now They just started modeling the stupid banana cat Oh Wait, you mean these shouldn't have the hard texture on the back. Oh Yeah, I can see how that would be confusing How would you build a building with these I Like this I guess Maybe they should be standing up. Actually. No, I don't like them standing You want the faces outwards I Think having the faces outwards. Mm-hmm. I'm not sure Just stack them up alternatingly Hmm I have an idea something that might be a bit better than this This is kind of how you drill play real bricks, right? Like that Okay, that's what you think to half outwards half inwards that's also an idea We can try that I What the fuck They should have the eyes closed, yeah, that's also a good idea And The idea is just gonna be that, you know one of them flies into it and knocks them all down and I think I want to delete the inner geometry and just kind of like You know make sure Mario can't get in there Because I think the inner geometry is gonna ruin this otherwise I don't want the player to you know, jump in there and get stuck or whatever Plus there's so many triangles on here I Try to remove the middle ring a little it looks too perfect. Otherwise too late. Oh, I Just want to make sure there isn't too many triangles here I The shading on the texture doesn't mean anything right now, that's not the actual shading you get I I What the hell Huh, how did I select all of these? All right, that's our bump tower In either X, so it doesn't look too repetitive That's also doable, yeah No, there is um, well you and the bumps the normal ones. Yeah, you just kick them in the back You're gonna kick the other ones over and that's gonna cause a chain reaction that will knock this over I I'm not making a sample level. Nope. I have playtested us one by one. Is it how I'm gonna be knocked over? I'm gonna do simulation import the animation. No, I'm just gonna Plop I Actually, maybe a demo of just the remake course one would be fun Just the people could be like, oh my god, and that's it This tower is tiny and what the hell I Look at the render near at the extra pump Zeina's working on it right now, so I cannot do that I Pay $12.99 to unlock the full game What would be the point of knocking over the tower? Is there something inside? No, the idea here is there's gonna be a bunch of people around that work for Bowser and you fuck with all of them. I The ones that we've already programmed it's the funniest shit ever And then once you've knocked all five over you get like a star or something It's not gonna be a star for something so simple I Should get no the thing is this is required for a star and we can't put a Yoshi coin on something that is required for a star That's just padding. That's like putting a red coin next to a star in a normal ROM hack. You know what I mean? If you've ever made a ROM hack where you put a star and right next to the star there's a red coin and there's like a really long way to the star. I want you to know that I hate you on a personal level. I think you are a bad person. What the hell? That's weird, okay, yeah, I wanted to show you the thing you really mess with the thing Alright, look at this. This is one of bozo's worker. He's a Goomba. He's just on his lunch break And he's about to have a terrible lunch break That's kind of tragic Made it greasy my boot. Oh my god Is that how you pronounce that? Please don't speak that language to me. I Don't speak by Rish I Think I need to do a little animation of the Goomba just like looking up at his doom Can I do that? He doesn't really look up. He just falls down But you can make an animation for it down What the hell no, it's here And the shading on it is fucked oh my god Did I not make sure to align it wait I see There we go It's the middle blank falling off I can't animation or simple physics it's just fake it's all fake Better games aren't real All right, it looks good now I just gotta move it to the edge here You can't do real-time. Okay, you can do whatever you want on the n64 because it's Turing complete You can't do anything on the n64. Why wouldn't you be able to?  Unless you like run out of memory or some shit Can you do shadow everything sure why not It's not gonna run very well, but why not All right, I think now they're aligned properly Next to make it so that if you take one of these over they're all gonna make a chain reaction Actually, I want to make it so that if you talk to them, they'd be like, oh my god I can't wait for my turn to get on the tower Song has invented this millennium now, I'm sure you could do chat GPT on n64. I don't see why not I Can't there's some weird holes in here that I want to close I Just connected them. Okay guys again We need to check the chat delay because I put on ultra low latency mode today I made sure a hundred percent that ultra low latency mode is on And Make sure you guys are at the very front of the video and tell me how much delay there is It's the one sort of mechanic physics that Mario can probably not handle having added in simulating individual atoms DNA that wasn't too bad Dude what if one day we figure out quantum physics and we are able to just make the n64 take advantage of it All right, let's make them talk about I That's the most stupid smart thing I have ever heard case You seem fit to run Twitter Okay, but there's nothing that we know that would prevent us from being able to take advantage of quantum physics on the n64 Maybe there's like a secret universe Could you have to do what if there's like a buck in the real universe like a divide by zero buck that lets you do? things like that that lets you just like Slow down time or something. You don't know that there's not I Got one patch it out. He would not he would never 350 is good here. I Don't drink coffee case quantum and say first kiss. All right, that's not a schizo rent. This is real I Am confident then at some point in the future Physics will advance to a point or we can take advantage of physics real life physics to make the n64 run faster. I Have no doubt about that you guys are insane for thinking that is never gonna be possible You Could you think you make a virus become an effect anything to see for a nice aroma or pearl or is it impossible It's possible because some amulet or it mom it might be possible I should say because you might be able to find an arbitrary code execution bug on an emulator There was one on moopin a while ago So technically you could have just made a bit going by not moving What's been recently solved for Euclidean space above I Thought that's like a thing you study in university, I'm pretty sure I did study at the university I Removing a small thing game is definitely possible, but I don't think it would look good There's actually another really big problem we need to solve in this level and That is how's the player for the first mission gonna figure out to mess with all these characters The characters you mess with us like This guy here. I was watching a cement pit and you're just gonna run into him Cement pit, there's the guy like having his lunch here and you're gonna mess with him and There will be some Koopas walking around I think here and You like kick over an oil barrel and it will like make them slide down I Mean oh shit that I hit the microphone. Whoops And What's the last one Oh two people carrying a piece of glass, yeah So those people are carrying glass somewhere I haven't decided where yet Probably around here and I need some kind of way to make sure that the player knows to mess with these Smoking they're not smoking. No one's smoking. Did I say smoking an accident? I was breaking the lighting. I don't know. We'll figure it out at some point. Don't worry about it Big glowing exclamation mark over the head Hmm feel like there's a more elegant way to do it That could be but I don't want that we've already got our five guys And You know to get in the walls of mom's fortress you don't it's one of the mission people hate the most for that reason Why would I use parallel launcher it's so fucking annoying to use The Interaction, yes, but like Maybe for like texts, you know for the Yoshi missions I do do that, but for this it just seems like a very not elegant solution It seems like a cheap cupboard rather than the solution It's like admitting oh, I can't make a good game. Let me just make sure the player knows how it works anyway We're just making it obvious and just outright telling them instead of communicating, you know, it's like the principle of show. Don't tell Exclamation mark is basically telling We get easy to do one of them by accidents and have one proper No, it's easy to do them by accident Like this guy is super easy to do by accident the glass guy is super easy to do by accident The Goomba one also super easy to do by accident the problem is how do you know to do all the five of them? Because I mess with America's allowing and could be my new task for both in order to do such as plants Well, it will be named something like that The problem is that it's not just these five workers. There's gonna be more workers, right? Like up there is gonna be a janitor with like a soap thing and I Had the workers here. I haven't decided actually Maybe there shouldn't be other workers here. Maybe the rest should just be enemies. I Really like the talks boxes here This whole place is kind of meaningless right now, honestly, this could just go and nothing would change I I kind of don't like this part of the level now that I think about it. I don't say But buzzer flex need important stuff so players are attracted to him. Ah, okay. I like that better Yes They look pretty good Balls of legs. Okay. Let's see Can we put the balls of like next to the Goomba here Okay, see there's actually a thing there's gonna be a wiggler over here here and he could also hint that at somehow He Could be like when you talk to him, he would say something like My Koopas are carrying the glass right now, please don't disrupt them And then if you destroy the grass he changes his text to something like oh My Goombas are on a lunch break right now. Please don't disrupt them something like that. I Think that's what I'm gonna do That is telling but like you have to seek it out Let's get Mario, it's just an HD version for the textures Yes, the music guy is back it's very good Overseer has a text hinting at the To But I think now the NPC then they are unlucky See, okay. That's actually a thing. I believe you can never truly get everyone up to a hundred percent success rate Instead what you can do is you can put in more and more failsafe mechanics So maybe without any failsafe, maybe 60% of players would figure out to you know Do all five tasks here, but then with the failsafe maybe like we get that up from like 60% to like 90% or even higher and Then like the other 10% are gonna struggle a little and figure it out Maybe like we can add an additional mechanic on top of that that like 90% of players would figure out and then the fail rate Would be 1% Wasn't you wanted to have as few character hints as possible No, I Don't mind character hints if you talk to someone they can hint you But see the thing is this is optional The idea is that you can completely figure out to mess with all of these by yourself Because kicking overwhelms seems pretty Inviting running through the cement is pretty inviting if two people with a glass carrier are very very inviting The only thing I'm not sure about is the all slope thing I Don't want them to rely on it, but it's still very much possible to figure out without I Mean, I want as many hints as possible as many layers of you know safety as possible But I want not a single hint to be like overbearing Ideally there would be like multiple small things to hinder that Now that's actually a thing we didn't missing link and I think it worked very well where that was like a library where it had to find like a hidden thing and we had like you had to push a shelf to the side and we had like tracks on the floor and Then we had a handle on the thing and then we had a map in the world and then we had a character talking about Secret entrance and then we had the geometry of the world laid up in a way that the secret ends couldn't be there So I like six layers of protection and everyone was bound to find one of them That's kind of how I like to design the missions and none of the hints were overbearing right if you found one of them And figured it out from just one hint you'd be like, oh my god I'm so smart and everyone's gonna figure out from the first and they actually get and I think that's great I don't think I need these triangles here and delete them Look they're busy working people. They're not on guard duty right now But yeah, if you have an additional hint for it Let me know and another hint here is that all of them were the bows of hell Right, you can mess it with everyone who wears a Bowser helmet. The overseer could also mention that like all his guys wear the Bowser helmets. Um... Talks about how all of his guys are wearing safety helmets, something like that. Does the flock need a slow fall or a quick fall? Because I had a slow one where he just kind of wiggles his arms.  No, that looks good to me. Maybe the end is a bit too fast, like that's not how he really accelerates, but like it's good. Yeah. So I can do it like this. Alright. He kind of has a little snap at that, like this. Yeah, it's too fast though. He can't go all the way down because there's going to be other ones in front of him. Only one of them can fall all the way down, so we kind of need two animations for falling. And the last animation has to be really slow because that's the one that pushes the tower. We may want to incentivize some people to... We may want an incentive to make people not like the workers other than just working for  them. So they may be similar to the workers and not think about messing with them. No. I think we'll be fine. You need one for him to not fall all the way through or not fall flat? All of them are not falling flat except for the very last one. Yeah. Then maybe have them fall on like an angle or something like this. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, that's very good. Make the workers root to Mario so players want to fuck them up. I like that. Maybe they all like... They should all say some dumb shit that kind of hints at you being Mario. All right. All the workers are root to Mario and pray... Actually, maybe they shouldn't praise Bowser because we're going to have them strike on the second act. Maybe you have some of the workers complaining about all the hard labor they have to do for  Yeah, of course. That's why they're striking. Yeah. I don't think I can do that. I don't know if CK did. Yeah, just say that they all root to Mario. French representation? French? How's the French in this? I thought I eradicated every sign of French in here. Okay, we need to make them kick a ball. It's a bit difficult because the back is not really kick a ball. I might have to edit the collision a little. Kick a ball? Okay. Okay. What if? Hear me out. That's their collision. They could have a prank someone worse too. Oh, I see. What do you mean? Maya? That could be a hint to kick the oil barrel. A sticker is not a bad idea. I don't know if I like to kick me sticker, but you know, something could work. Where's the other thing I have to kick? Act flagged. I'm sure I've made a function for if Mario is attacking something or not. Okay. Hi. Maybe I don't know what geometrical robot is. Okay. I got the mobs idle too. All right. All right. Two very simple ones. Actually three if you count the half ball. Do you have both thoughts now? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Then send it over. Okay. Hello, I'll be. There you go. I respect the modeling of the banana cat. Okay. Right. She's crying about render range. Let's give him one. She no longer needs to cry. Yeah, I majored in math. What does majored in math mean? Wait, maybe I didn't major in math. I studied math in university. What is majoring in something? Okay, number one class. The main reason you go. But like high school. Because I also majored in math in high school. Did you know someone's putting Sonic Unleashed to the 3DS? I didn't know and I also don't care. Don't mind when you think the hack will release. I'm planning to release it on the 30th. Which I think is like the deadline for someone's competition or something. Okay, we actually have a problem. And that is that we need to find the next 1.9 here. Which B-parameters is used? It looks like the first one. That's such a fucked up way to program that. Okay. I'm fine with this being called ship. We need a no-OST. Any wishes? The hit Mario 64 OST? Absolutely not. Oh shit, this animation should not loop. The golden OST? Super Mario Bros. NES OST. What if we have like a remix of that? Super Mario Bros. NES HD OST. I don't want to listen to the fucked up one. HD Remake OST maybe? Oh shit. Remastered 80s style. And a spaghetto? Yes, I'm streaming on YouTube. I couldn't stand Twitch anymore. What the fuck is wrong with you, Kakita? Cool. Very funky. Something tells me that Twitch isn't gonna go under. I just can't Twitch anymore because of all the ads. But also it's nice having this all be in one place, I guess. Huh? Why is it not talking to him? I guess there's something else I'm missing. Let's just try this. Discord is going to work. I don't know this much of Discord's policies when I use Discord, though. Even if you don't like the politics of Discord, it doesn't really affect the program. Oh, that looked so cool. Oh my god. They gotta be a bit closer by each other, but... Ooh, the animation works well. Let's see it again. I think maybe their hands should be kinda hanging after that. I forgot. I completely forgot about that. Do you want me to fix it real quick, or do you have it? I can fix it, I guess. Alright.  I believe cases can work, true. It's over, guys. Opinions on... What are American values? Other than guns and Burger King. The family. And beer. That doesn't sound very American. It's not case anymore, it's days. No, he's gone woke. It is over, guys. So, I want the sound to play here. What sound does he play? Nothing. Oh no. This is the one I wanted.  Mm-mm. Okay, I think they're not quite lined up yet, so I'm going to make them fall a bit more and I'm going to do the change with the arms. I sent you something funny. I can't look right now. Let's see what you got for me. Oh, it's the banana kit. Isn't he beautiful? Yes. Motto of the Bobbers. I have no idea what that is. Dude, I was thinking of making the decision to just completely never talk about politics on my channel and then I realized, oh my God, that would be like such a psychopath thing to do. That would be so manipulative. That's not me. So I'm thinking I should just not give a fuck. I would feel like such a psychopath for doing that. It's that meme you dreamed up. No, it's real. Banana kit is real. Oh, that was the whole OST. Well, I guess we're done. Refusing to talk politics is very incriminating. I don't know. It's like it's not incriminating, but it's like trying to like hide yourself from the people that might dislike you for your views or something. It's such a psychopath thing to do. I don't know. It's just the vibe I'm getting. One time I asked you what your IQ was and you didn't want to tell us. Tell us. I will not tell us. Two hours of relaxing music for Nintendo. Let's do it. I should collab with Ben Shapiro. There's so many ways that could be very funny. You are ashamed because it's in a double digit. I mean, if you get a 90% on your IQ test, wouldn't that be good? John Trium, wait, who's John Trium? Oh, Joseph M. I see. Bye, Albie. Hi, Brian. Dude, I almost put in a null pointer check here. Working in professional game development fucked up my brain. Checking for a null pointer. Fucking... Not what I meant to say. Here, CLA, no, I'm getting damaged. I suppose if you're adding bumps into N64 engine, that's been done before for official Nintendo games, but would be expensive to achieve, it would be very expensive. Dude, I feel like you have to be an idiot to be on Mansa. Why would you pay someone to tell you you're smart? You should pay to know you're smart, you already know you aren't, it's true. I was thinking that maybe it'd be really funny to just like practice IQ tests until you get into one of those like really high society things and you go to a meeting and you act like the biggest idiot possible. Because I think you just need to score like 180, which with some practice, it's not that difficult to do. And then you can get into like these top exclusive 100 members in the world clubs and you can just be a complete dickbag. Okay, it fell, but it didn't fall very well. Maybe we can just like, yeah, fuck it, 4.5. Actually, 3.5. Are you making a video for your main channel currently? Well, there's going to be F3 and I'm going to release only up 64. So that's two videos I'm going to upload and both are like within the next month. After that, I might make like a video about micro optimizing the ATAN function. Cool. Why is it not falling? Make the top fall the same way. I don't need tips on how to program this. Don't worry about it. Oh, I see. This is not a difficult thing to figure out. I just have like a few random mistakes here and there in the code. I improved water.c by a lot. Do you even know how much time I saved with the improvements over your water.c? They're not funny as fuck. I love this. Now make them make sounds. They do make sounds, but the sounds are overwriting each other. So that's not good. The problem is that the sound doesn't restart when it's played again. How do I make the sound restart when it's played again? What's the second to last argument? Priority. Sound discreet. Sound discreet. That's the lowest bit. So it's in flex too, is it not? Five Worm Grunts. Oh, you want Worm Grunts as well. Yeah, I'm fine with Worm Grunts. Let's play the short one. Does this one restart? It doesn't. Okay, I need to do some testing here to see how the sound plays. I used the Domino 1xDS so much. Actually, I think this is like the second time I'm using it. I like it too much to not use it. I can barely hear the sound. Yeah, every other one plays the sound. That 0x80 did not restart the sound as intended. Hmm. Is Galaxia the first really? When? Okay. Okay. I'm just gonna use Sound Layer 8 for this. It's not a tragedy that we have to do the Sound Layer thing. The upcoming is a bit odd. What's wrong with it? It sounds like they puke. Kinda. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't remember him being in the toy level. Oh, he made actual dominoes. Okay, let's listen to this. Ears open. What the fuck? Oh, wait. Five and eight. No. Three and eight are the same. Five and nine are the same. So, this is four actually. Yeah, five and nine are the same. Okay. RQMIO is still below 43 megabytes and I have found a lot of size optimization I have to apply soon. He already lost motivation before that curses. He was gonna release it in 2017. He found out it was cancelled like 2019. That's two years after his projected release date. I don't know how far it actually got, considering it's still not released. Okay. Oh. Oh. The thing is that this runs first, so... So, the object chain doesn't have a chance to run. He's still working on releasing chips on Twitter. That is surprising. Is he... Wait. You say he's working on it. Is he showing the same clip of him standing on the box that he throws again and again? Because I know even back then he was stalling with that clip over and over. Alright, I like that. Kinda. Now I just need to make it have a proper condition. What I did see is awesome. KhakiDev is just salty that I changed his code to be a bit faster on the N64. His saltiest code wasn't optimized. Let's test. So making fun of him about it. Maybe making a boss that moves and you can stand on like on the physics strength unit. This is true. No, Lila, don't eat. I don't know. It's not even funny. I don't know. Do I still need optimization ideas I never needed optimization ideas, but if you have one I'll listen to it. Nah, purple is a grown up color, Lina is still a baby. She can be purple when she's older. Man who asked his $20 Akinator for optimization ideas, my $20 Akinator, that's the way to do it. Ah, I see what the issue is, there is a talkbox here that is too big, I'll make the talkbox smaller. I don't like that you can walk into it. Alright, let's give them a text. Man's using the whole alphabet to program. What what wait what's wrong some guy? Sorry I missed your previous comment. What did he say? Okay, I don't see a comment before this one. I don't know what they sound like, I mean having it be like a really rough stream is funny huh. I can, I can make the last screen the spawn king there, I think that's funny. They're not just gonna say first. Alright, time to add 10 more texts, we already have 340 texts in this game, that is so many And as you kick one of the middle ones by the way, they fall forward and the ones behind you stay. I can show in a second, I haven't actually tested it, but that's what I programmed it like. Seven one seven.  The codebase isn't bad, it's just a little hard to read. You need to actually use your brain to read it. Isn't that nice? Where's the bump? Okay I guess I removed it on accident oh no that was unreadable how did that happen oh your messages won't send so I think that works pretty well the best cereal is nougat bits and uh what's the other one carl zaner the one my parents give you all the time I don't know what it's called but it's like I call it my good shit well that one's good too Captain Crunch you're not serious you're trolling it's like made with ancient grains or something all right okay I have one thing that I'm concerned about and that is the whole platform over there dude buy a bag dude let's fucking go Crave is like the closest thing to nougat bits but I think nougat bits are better yeah Crave is like worse nougat bits dude but can you believe it a better version of that so yeah so none of these missions reference this platform here this whole platform has no purpose other than to extend some platforming a little bit and considering we had performance issues anyway this is like a prime candidate for just cutting it so you serve zero purpose I sent you another thing another thing yes oh let's fucking go it's banana kit if this is the worst thing I've ever made I want to show this on the gear server oh okay nintendo you can hire me now fire me nintendo final boss I'm thinking of just removing that and having the path up here go a different route so maybe without the crane because actually this is where the boss is it's kind of weird to have the boss platform right next to the power generator entrance so maybe not maybe it is good that we have this little bit of buffer here maybe I can just shorten it a little but if I shorten it then the whole crane needs to move as well let's see what we can do this course doesn't seem very challenging for a late game course don't worry about it it's gonna be challenging enough you guys see me play and I do it all effortlessly but that's because I'm a god at this game you play this and you will have struggles the layout seems confusing I am very surprised to hear that considering how straightforward this is either way I think what I'm gonna do is have this move have this move  and then this could be here just to shorten this whole thing a little bit and this whole factory could just be moved like here how high is this 500 coordinates that's doable although I would prefer it with a little bit less because this doesn't look very intentional right now  it seems a lot better so let's try this layout the giant Bowser statue makes the course pretty linear you are only seeing like a third of the course right now there's still an underground section there's a section inside Bowser's tower there's a section in the power generator and you can go either way around if you're good at the game you can probably even oh you can't touch that oh you can't touch the Bowser statue right now but I'm sure you could have gotten on there and then from there you can get up here and then from up here you can just get over there guys okay I actually believe that difficulty in a game is not a thing you should strive for instead you should strive for having cool platforming and sometimes the cool platforming just so will happen to require something more difficult to do and I think if you look at the red coin section here that's one of the most difficult parts in the game I think because you're gonna have to do stuff like that I see how difficult that is even I couldn't do it so this is also only course 11 compared to like tiny huge islands oops something climatic did you get that with tiny huge islands maybe you would expect something climatic you should also never judge the difficulty of something by just watching me play that's just a bad idea what the hell that's a bug right I can't do shit like that you guys can't do that at least I don't think you can and I'm not gonna expect you guys to do movement like this so yeah this this platform is not safe to stand on right now and yeah it's really fun to move around and like I'm enjoying myself just running around here I don't need the difficulty should defensive collisions yes but we're we're not adding any collisions so far the collision always does then at the very end either way I think this layout is a lot better now that we have cut this in half to use this part I'm kind of thinking of having more Torx boxes around here just like going in a circle or something so like instead of this we just remove this and have Torx boxes go in a circle here oh Badu brought me but he's not done yet unlucky It's gonna be 2 screens, excellent, but we might have to just be satisfied with 20fps. So if I connect these and have 2 talkboxes go in a permanent circle here, that could be really cool. Oh, I also don't like how this platform is anymore, it's kind of placed awkwardly. About the multiplayer thing, do you still think adding it into the game is a good idea? Yes. Why not? I can't get high enough to see it from here, that's why I want to release it, er, delete it. I'm just not sold on this section here, it's kinda eh, kinda not that great. The oil is just gonna fade you out if you fall in and then respawn you back with like 2 health gone. Of course multiplayer is gonna be a talkable option, it's cheating if you make a separate Alright, let's import the Koopa animations and then after that we're gonna import the glass carriers. Do I have the animations here? I do not. A lotmodel? What do you mean by lotmodel? Lotmodel from us? So you're not doing customs anymore? Are you considering extra characters? Extra characters would be kinda cool. But who would we add? Mario and Luigi is a given, but who beyond that? Yoshi has a 100% reward for hiring a lot of Luigi. Okay, Mario and Luigi are gonna be awkward though, because you buy shit from Mario and you encounter Waluigi. Yoshi I'm absolutely fine with. Although then again, I guess that's something that even happened in Mario Galaxy and they just had a textbox for it. The problem is, if we have Yoshi as a character, having a rideable Yoshi? Okay, maybe we can do that. But that would be fucked up. Yellow Toad, Blue Toad? Absolutely fucking not. Who wants to play as a Toad? Peach. We can just despawn him when someone is playing as him. Yeah. I still don't like that though. I'd rather have just a funny text. Oh, but there's also so many people that ask you to just cosplay as Mario. Although I guess I can just replace the text. It wouldn't be that difficult. Alright, that works. Let me check if I can still talk to these. I gotta figure out why the talk no rotation didn't work. Because I want this one to talk with rotation. More textboxes. I have no idea what you mean by that. Is that a bad thing? Is that a good thing? Let me complain about the current amount of textboxes. Wait, but why are you saying more textboxes? What's wrong? The cement guy? Hello. You don't need to talk to the cement guy. Wait, I forgot to give this guy some text. But this is my text and I see there's a lot. Well, a lot of the text in this game is just flavor text that you don't really need. And Mario 64 has a lot of text that exists two or three times in the same way. There would be another Romhack release before this one? The Banjo-Ex Mario 64 hack is gonna release before this one, I think. I mean, this game has a lot of text, but there's also a lot more content in this, so I don't really mind it. I think. Is this what they should say? I can't wait to be a building. I can't wait until it's my turn to be a building. Uh, 84. I never learned how to say this rule. That is a valid point. Actually, if we say an exclamation mark, it's less deadpan. Tough call to make, honestly. If Mario would be able to wear a construction set, how many of those courses would I have for each course? Not for planning, but just as a bonus? The problem is, if we make a multiplayer and we have multiple characters, I'd have to do that on every character. And that's gonna be a lot of work that I don't really wanna do. Oh, no cutting the line, I like that. Oh, and they should be assholes to Mario. Yes, yes, okay, I like your text a lot. Back off, Pipsqueak. No cutting the line. Back off, Pipsqueak. I was in line to be a building first. How's an elegant way to say this? It's almost my turn to be... Back off, Pipsqueak. No cutting the line. It's almost my turn to be made into a building. Back off, Pipsqueak. I literally gave you a way to say it, yeah, but you said M in the prize mode to be used as part of that fine building up ahead. That doesn't feel very elegant, you know. I want it to be as straight to the point as possible, so we waste the least amount of possible time for the player. So we need to back off Pipsqueak, they need to be rude. We need them to imply that there's a line, so no cutting the line. And then we need them to state a goal. It's almost my turn to be made into a building in a non-awkward way. I'm just trying to keep the text as short as possible here. That's a bad way to think about dialogue. I mean, yeah, use as more personality. I find this the difficult call to make. I like that they say I'll crush you too in your text. All right, fine, I'll use yours. I'm just trying to keep the text as short as possible here.  I'm just trying to keep the text as short as possible here. All right, let's try this. I'm the next brick, not you. Okay, that is very funny. That feels very good. It needs a bit more VFX here, I think. There should be like stars played at the point of impact or something. Or like a dust cloud. I like that. Dude, I actually have this particle system and I really like it. Just the fact that I can just make particles like this. Oh, that's so cool. What kind of particles would work here? Mist particles maybe? That's not funny. Yeah, that's not so easy to do. I would have to make changes to the actual engine code there. Might be worth it, but like... Eh. Hand fetish mindset. You will actually be faster by just kicking the last one. There are so many good puns in German. I noticed that with the bench Kazooie hack I'm making. A lot of the time the pun is just better in German than in English.  Shots of Yoshi? Nope. Who's talking about my hands and why? Y'all like my hands? You guys see how fucked up my hands are from lifting so much weight? They're all crusty. You can't have a fetish for those. They're man hands. The offset's not there. Why is that? You think it's all the shortcuts? It still spawns on the floor. Oh! DY is the third one. That's a fucking weird way to make these arguments. Oh well. Okay. And they need to be bigger. And they're only alive for four frames. That's... Actually that's kind of... That's kind of fine. Can you offset the animation frame on all of these? Sure. Okay. There you go. That is a good idea. It's like the third time you mess up because of the same thing. The transformation... No, first I thought it was messed up because I didn't specify the type and I thought the compiler compiled it to an S16 root. Yeah, it's still not up properly. I can make it up a bit more, then it should work. It should work. Maybe like so. Is it intentional that the thwomps sound cut in after the tower gets knocked over? Yes! They are screaming in agony. Alright, that looked decent. Kinda like the VFX here. I can make a few more changes to it. Does the second animation even have 16 frames? 40?  Well then. Yeah, I'm not 100% sold on the last scream either. I mean, I made a bunch of screams in a short succession. So, maybe it's better to like... Let's try something like this. And for this, I want there to be a bit velocity. That's only live for 6 frames, that's a bit small. This has to be a bit more debris. Alright. Alright, this animation seems to lack interpolation. The fuck? Does it look like there's no interpolation right now? I see the interpolation just fine. Oh yeah, I like this. It's perfect. I like the sound with it too in the VFX. Alright, next up, this man. Is he the angry one? Yeah, he gets angry after you make a bunch of steps in here. I sent you all the animations for Koopa, right? Yeah, I have them right here. Okay. Wait, there's talking and talking angry? What's talking for? That's just the regular talk animation. When does he do this? I don't know. I figured the Koopas would have some regular talk animations. Oh. I thought that was a given. I mean, talk animations are nice, but usually they just do it in their idle animation. You don't have to implement them if you don't want to. Please change his eyes, he looks so weird. I can't draw eyes. You do it. Lila. Alright, I guess I'm doing the eyes again. I mean... Hang on. Okay. Yeah, I don't know if I changed the eyes since you said that, because I know Zeina was drawing one, and I think I changed them already, and now I have to change them again. Okay. What if I make them, like, slightly annoyed? Show me the Simandarin real quick. Sure. This is what it looks like. Annoyed? Like his eyes? Yeah. That would work. Okay. Oh, I see. Yeah, that's what you mean. You mean that his eyes should be like... Let me just get this real quick. Okay. Like, you want his eyes to be kind of like... This. Which I agree, it looks better. Yeah. The one thing I don't like about it is that they are kind of cut off now, but I guess this fixes that. What if after you step in his Simandarin, he's like, what the fuck are you doing? And he needs to think as well, so you get up on the container and push the metal box into the Simandarin. Oh, I've seen this. That is really funny, but like... Oh, just any metal box? Okay. That's really funny, but like, it adds more text, and it makes this mission even more complicated. I think the mission is big enough as this. That's like an additional potential point of failure I don't really want to risk.  Careful, don't stick in my cement pit. Or careful with cement. And then after that, you ruined it. It's just like really short. But walking in there is awkward. Well, if you walk in there, it's going to take a while. You're supposed to like dive for ground content. I see what you mean though. I agree, it's maybe a bit weird. I'm going to die in Koopasaunt here. So, get some cement fresh. I don't want to see ugly footprints in there. Yeah, that's a much better hint. All right. It needs to be 64x64. 32x64 is better. I mean, the smaller you can make it, the better. Yeah, they do need to be mean to Mario, otherwise the player might not even want to do it. Nah, he's going to get angry. He's going to be like, oh my god, my hard work. Bowser's going to punish me now. All right, let me just... Wait, what? Angry? Oh, that's after you ruin his thing? Yeah. All right, that's going to be afterwards. Like he's just tired, and then this is just him being angry. All right. Dude, Bandoop is hyping up the song for this level so much. It's going to be the best thing ever. He still doesn't talk to me. Maybe you could have little nostril pups coming out of his nose. Like with the dinosaur? Yeah. Yeah, that would be really funny. I also want to make little speech bubbles. Kind of like the ones we have for all the event Yoshis. But with different emotions. I don't like that. That's not fitting for Mario 64. Eh, fair. Why isn't he talking to me? Why are you just soft-talking me, dude? Oh, it's because of this, I bet. Bye-bye, Koopa Boy. Bye-bye, Koopa Boy. Let's make Koopa Boy angry real quick. Hey, there we go. Instead of kids, I meant fresh. I don't want to see ugly footprints in there. He didn't say ugly. Very mean fish? That's the wrong text. He's definitely angry. It works, though. It works really well. Lila says to add the talking animation. Yeah, I'll add it. Don't worry, Lila. Why did it say very ugly fish? Very ugly fish? This is why. This is why. This should do it. He has one nostril? What? He should have two. Yeah, that is a current dialogue. Let's see how it looks. What happened to him? I'm not sure. Why isn't he here? What? Where did the animation export to? Is this a Fast64 bug? Where's your FastBug emotes? I think it was a Fast64 bug. Nostril? Nasenloch? I didn't break like that. It just... It just didn't add the animation to the table. Because there was already another animation that had the same name with something else appended, I think. You ruined it. This is so funny. He's so angry. He's so pissed. He should just start attacking you? Why are you talking about his nostrils? They're perfectly fine. Oh, maybe not. I don't know. I can kind of see why it looks like one nostril. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Bad VHS code. Yeah, you didn't see anything, luckily. I don't know. Alright, so one more thing I need to do is make it so his rotation goes back to 90 degrees after he is done talking to Mario. He just eagerly watches the cement pit. So, are we ready to do Epic Games? Yeah, because I'm working on Unreal Engine. It's an Epic Games thing. This is so funny, dude. This level is so fucking funny. How is this level so funny? Between all the comedic things and the animations. Oh, and he's dead. Dude, that would have been a sick concept for a troll hack. You are the troll. You are trolling people. That would have been so much better than anything else anyone's put into the troll hack competition. I feel like they need some at least the one at the back needs a line about trying to get up. Maybe one of them needs a line of dialogue at the end of them. No, they are all just giving up. I think this is fine. Alright, guys. I think that is it for today. We finished two more things. Next, we only need the wiggler and we need the oil people. After that, we have all five trolls and you can get the first star. We will finally have finished the first star in this level. That's going to feel like such a huge step. Anyway, I'll see you guys next Saturday. Bye-bye.
