You you howdy sully hello hello hello james hello clayman let me just get ready howdy nick williams hello twista so hello Josiah, hello NeoVim, hello Nintendo for life, howdy Terminator! I made some insane progress over the week that I'm gonna show you guys literally right now you look Amish, I'm a cowboy are you sure you want an F-Zero game tank? what you're describing doesn't sound like an F-Zero game, hello Sio, howdy I also not like a stir mode, like a steer mode, my controller is all tangled up let me pause the music I'm listening to right now and show you guys this level here, good day Borno oh god Clayman that sounds bad but how fucking cool is this hello Skyloft we even got the high noon, it's high noon I really like the tumbleweeds, you can even kick them if you want big sky pancake, yeah the sun looks bad, I need to make it look good still we got a sheriff's office here, we got just okay I'll tell you what the houses are right now so you guys can get an idea of what it looks like, but actually before I do that let me fix one issue with the tumbleweed, any cowboy song playlist we want to listen to today, any wishes, desires by the way did you guys like the new video, it's kind of doing terrible on YouTube I thought it's like my favorite video ever, but people don't seem to watch it much Mario Party 2 western land, I want to listen to Mario Party cowboy songs, Mario cowboy songs, surely we'll find a playlist there's a few songs here but hello itzy five percent was still interesting, nice nice, can also check if the game is running on emulator with this, yes yes I do actually check if the game is running on emulator, I'm making it so that on emulator drawing distances are unlimited for example and it defaults to 60 fps instead of 30 you understood the whole, okay that's perfect you just need to watch the whole thing you need to understand it macho bull cowboy boss there's a lot of cowboys here but no bull, there's gonna be a goomba or five goombas rather they are a gang, there's gonna be a snuffit and a shy guy, those are the three cowboys you hunt down hola dimensio um one thing I don't like about the tumbleweeds is that both of them spawn at the same time, there's two tumbleweeds actually, hello lukashi, you know you should make a hack based on a trolling problem at the smc4dcom community, so true, you don't have to google gadget goombas very similar yeah okay I'm just gonna listen to this until someone suggests a cowboy ost hello selton, meowdy bartner  yes I'm on twitch and youtube at the same time make a release here too, we already have three releasios, I'd have to make releasio 4 um there will be cork guns here not actual real guns just like the cork ones all right I'll give you a rundown of the buildings, this will be the sheriff's office, there will be some wanted poster right next to it here with a bunch of the criminals you catch three criminals during the level and they will all go in here and maybe you talk to them afterwards, they'll be really upset with you then next up right here we have the cowboy store, there's a giant hat on top of the building let me just fly up so we can see it, you will be able to just look at hats here, there will be a bunch of hats in the stores here, one store clerk, you won't be able to buy one the balls are halfway through the ground, are they? they're slightly in the ground but not halfway, do you want me to move them up? very easy to do let me make sure actually, let's see how big they are the lowest vertex is oh minus 80, shit, I thought the lowest vertex was minus 40, okay, good point Biomech they were half as up down as they need to be, so that house over there is a random house, doesn't mean anything, we got some fossils here, this will be the big iron store, there will be a sign here that just says big iron and this is a gun store, maybe there were people talking about guns and I just noticed an issue with the arena here, what's a fedora, this is the cowboy level GTM, I gotta be in the cowboy mood, howdy partner, then next up here we have a hotel, this I don't know what the name for this is yet, we have to make one up still, there will be more wanted posters here and the sign that says train comes every 10 seconds and I will have a train that follows these things here, do you guys like the train tracks? I'm not sure about them I wouldn't say that I know the architecture perfectly well Pucallo, I don't know, I never really attempted to learn the architecture perfectly well, all the knowledge I gained about it has just kind of happened, no you could maybe raise the metal parts higher up, they look fine, remember what I said about the train tracks, I don't know if I can do that, I don't know what happened to GPTV, Dan, go and play TV, what happened to him? Maybe you can look up some more pictures, well I tried, there was like a strange issue with Hinevahead, rode into town the other day, I tried to land with the bounties we have for criminals and he just ran away screaming, I'm not sure if I understand the reference, is it supposed to be like that the the conspiracy theory Yoshi is a criminal? If so then yes, oh the bounties, okay I see, yeah that's a good one, this is also gonna be a random house, this guy's gonna have some cactuses out here that he's growing, we already went by the store, so next up is my favorite store in this, right here, this is gonna be the tumbleweed store, there's gonna be just a shady seller here selling tumbleweed, I think that idea is fucking hilarious, just the idea of someone being like, dude everyone loves tumbleweeds, you never thought about where all these tumbleweeds are coming from, I'm selling them, the fuck you mean? That concept is just so funny to me, this is gonna be a random house and out here is gonna be a chain shop, just chain to the pole, this right here is gonna be the bank, there is a bank robbery in this level but you kind of just like come in and post after the robbery, howdy partner, this is gonna be, I don't know what this is gonna be yet, I think I have an idea for this, let me check, oh the unagi oil store, yes yes yes, so you know how there were snakes oil salesmen, we're gonna have a unagi oil salesman, and then right here that's gonna be the saloon, the bank building looks terrible, what you don't like the pure blue? So I think this is gonna be designed after money bag, I'm thinking of maybe putting like gold bars in front of it, like one on the ground here, one on the ground over there, will you ever make any attack because this can't get any better, can it? I don't know, I mean I keep getting better at it, so will there be a choo-choo train? Yes, this is the question actually, what do we start with? Do we make the bank today or do we make the choo-choo train? Mario will not have a cowboy hat, I think by the way we should make it so that you can buy a tumbleweed at the tumbleweed store and it's just gonna be one of these, you're just gonna have one, okay, everyone wants a train, are you going to have a reaction image when Mario lands on the cactus? Nah, these are just gonna be normal platforms, dude this song is such a vibe, all right we'll do the train, when a cowboy hat? I don't wanna, it's just not real, especially if you're gonna add luigi, I don't wanna do skins, especially because it's gonna be so much fun, like just one level, we would have to do it in every level, all right we'll start with the train, we need osts, guys you need to pick one, so my train reference here is the calamari desert, I think we have this for the tracks as a reference, and ah yes, this is what I'd like, I can't do big iron, I already built a building, can make the sign, oh this is good, so the tamale for kid really wants one but can't afford it, well there's tumbleweeds everywhere, so that wouldn't make much sense, would it? Let's see what kind of trains we can base this off of, oh, oh, oh, they literally just straight up have to train, a guy with a harmonica in this level would just be so fitting, who remembers this guy, prehistoric gamers only, so it's dr gawashima, it's dr gawashima, the smash bros trophy guy, oh, he is not an ancient gamer, not a prehistoric gamer, sorry he's just an ancient gamer, so I think I want just the choo-choo train and then you can just jump on it, and then yeah, I think that's what it should be, dude it's not even on this, you see that, that's not how trains work, hello wufu, um do we use this or this, actually let's use this as a base and just draw over it,  guys I want you to know my dedication to the cowboy theme is still big, I started only watching cowboy tv shows while working on this, I am literally watching westworld right now, okay so would you give some lifting tips or not today, if you need any lifting advice I can give you some lifting tips, well you would have to ask a specific question though, okay, oh I see this is how it works, that looks good, here's some decom tips, where are the custom level textures in the decom variable, they are in the level.inc.c file, I look like an Oklahoma citizen, I don't know if that's in this, dude I really like the 64 at the front of the train, does the original one look like that too, so where's the n64 version, the fuck, oh it looks like this, oh that's cool, yeah you mean you can edit them if you can just edit the raw hex data if you want, so technically you can rip them from there, put them in the hex editor, open them with an n64 rip, edit the file there and then export it back, yeah I'm definitely gonna keep the 64 in it, so Maybe I should just get the actual rip from the game. Is it bad if we don't use the exact same train? I feel like it kinda is. But this also just doesn't fit the art style of my game. I feel like I should get an in-between of the both. I've been stuck trying to curl past 70 pounds, I just can't get stronger from there. I rocked my lap to curling up to 70, but I can't add more weight. Is this normal? I've been stuck at 70 for like 6 weeks. There are many different reasons you could be stuck, overtraining could actually be one of them. That you're just training too much. I'm assuming 70 with both hands combined, right? Or like 70 per hand. Because if it's 70 per hand, then you need a lot of recovery, because your muscles would have to be very very big. If it's 70 both hands combined, then... I don't know. But make sure not to injure yourself, actually. It's very easy to injure yourself during bicep curls, as I had to happen like 2 or 3 times. And then I had to take months long breaks. Your farm just dies. What rep range do you train in right now? Because I do alternate between 12 reps and 9 reps for my sets. And I find that when I alternate, I just get more benefits out of it. What song is this? I feel like I know this one. Teehee Valley from RnLuigi. I stole what? Oh, the train. Yeah, I literally just did that on stream. Why is the ambient noise so high? We have an oven. It turns on every now and then. It's gonna turn off again in like a few seconds. There you go, it's off. The HD version and the normal version have some difference here. This front part doesn't exist in the low quality version. The song is in Gamma64. I do not know your beta games, I'm sorry. I've never been interested in the Mario 64 beta. I don't know why people are. It seems like such a weird fascination to me. Why are you purposely seeking out the inferior version? Okay, that's a good shape so far. 30x20, then 45x12 to warm up, then rest for 1 minute, then go for slow reps at 70. And most likely this will ruin this. Oh, those are weird warm-up sets. I don't think you need to warm up that much. When I warm up, I just do like 2 reps and then move on. And 7 reps is a little low. At that point, are you even getting effective reps in or are you just kind of like cheating in? You should also always train not directly to failure on your first set, but like 1 or 2 reps before that. And then on the last one you train to failure, that's what I do. I find that works very well. It's because the actual exhaustion you feel is gonna increase exponentially. I actually can't record my real footage of the CRT directly, unfortunately. I'm trying to figure out this shit, like how's the geometry here? The hell, what is this? Is that part of the... Oh, that's the next wagon, I see. And then there's this weird white shit here. Oh, maybe we can just watch it here. Don't know anything about Game Day Runner, I'm just... What about GTA 6? Wait, what did I miss about GTA 6? Wait, we got a sub? Someone subscribed? Thank you for subscribing! Welcome to the Yoshi gang! What is the Wolverine leak and what do people not know? Another sub! Thank you for the other sub. Did someone donate a bunch of subs or something? Did I miss something? Someone gift subbed? Wait, how many gifts were there? Did I miss this? I can't see Twitch chat. You guys need to let me know when something happens. You get a five pack. Oh, thank you for the five, dude. Okay, so there is something under this. I think I see how this is built. Kinda. Yes, everyone knows what a great entertainer I am on stream. Just programming code into my console. This is truly entertainment. Wait, there was another one? Thank you. I'm glad you like my hat. And thank you for the sub. I'm sorry I missed your name. This is the disadvantage of being on Twitch and YouTube at the same time. Dude, the Yoshi dancing mod. I missed that one. Wait, someone wrote me. Who is this? Scamps. Oh, my God. I think the train shape is good so far. Now it needs the bumper at the front. You're making a low-poly train? Yes. This level has a train, so we need to make a low-poly train. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. Who else meows the songs they listen to? I keep getting comments from people that I do the N64 development looks crazy. I'm so glad I don't have to develop for this. No, it's not the N64 development that's crazy. It's just me. It's me. I am the crazy one. How did you jump off the edge when we can throw you back? Like the first level of Lost Impact. I don't think we need that here. In Lost Impact I added that because the level was otherwise too difficult. Do you guys think I should join the new Twitch meta of sensor bars? Basically you stream naked and then put sensor bars over your body. Do you guys think people would be into that? Like all times? Dude, I never streamed naked. I just streamed shirtless because it was too fucking warm. I promise that was the only reason. I even had the receipts from an actual doctor saying I have heat hives. You just wanted to show your muscles? No! I literally had an issue. Did I explain your sub count increasing? Maybe it's because I streamed hard. Release date? You're not allowed to stream shirtless on YouTube? Are you sure? That's so mean, KirkyDev. Alright, let's put some wheels on here. Wait, this has to... This is moved slightly forward on the N64 version. I guess to make space for the wheels. Hello, Baranew. Hello. What kind of wheels do we model here? On the N64 version, these are just 2D textures. I don't think we can make this be 3D models. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's a Mario Kart 7 version of this? Are you kidding me? I didn't know of this. What the hell? It looks so good. I want that one. Which console was this for? DSi? 3DS? You think the train is part of this? Maybe? Hopefully? Nah. Okay. Looks like an anime texture with blonde wheels. Yeah, that's what it looks like. I guess we should use that. Let me google. How to make Mario Kart 7 models. You know what? Fuck it. I'm not doing that. I'm just gonna copy what it does. It looks very, very nice, actually. Either way, I think planes are our best option here. Okay. Should be the line kind of like this. The Peach Pin? Why would that be the name for an hotel? What's that got to do with anything? You don't like it?      You don't like Honey Bee being in that? That's fair. But honestly, I think it's fine. You gotta have some wild cards in there. If you just put the predictable characters in, that's also boring. Okay. Let me just get a size reference here. Looks to be about twice the size of the other ones. And almost right next to this one. It is in front of the back of the train, though. I think this is about right. Are you looking for the train model? Yes, I would like the train model a lot. Okay. Yeah. That is true. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that seems about right to me. I'm still looking at this. Are we just retreating the Carnival level with the railroad suspended in the air like that? No? Huh? How do we do that? Explain. What's that got to do with the Carnival level? I don't know. I actually don't want this to be the exact same train now that I think about it. Maybe it's good that it doesn't look the exact same. Okay. Because it's not the actual exact same train, right? Okay, so we learned about the assumption tricks from Alan Turing. What are you talking about? I don't know who these people are I'm just making good coat. That's it How's Christmas? Christmas is tomorrow. What will the Unagi all do? Nothing. It's just a funny gag Should the cavern be longer? I don't think so. Christmas Eve is a real Christmas to me That's the way it is in my culture And you know what it's better that way because you're a kid you are getting your Christmas one day early Okay, think about this. Isn't it way nicer to open your presents in the evening and then you get to play with them for a little bit And you get to doze off to sleep thinking about all the cool stuff you're gonna get to do tomorrow with your gifts And maybe you're even up late you get to play with your shit up late dude, that's so cozy We should, yes, Zeyna? You already know what you're getting? Dude, what's the point of Christmas if you already know what you're getting? Can you just being happy is the point? Yeah, I like that. Isn't that way nicer? Are you formally trained? I can bench press 315 pounds pretty easily. I'm trained in that sense I am streaming on Twitch and YouTube at the same time AuroSphere I feel like something's missing from our train here. What is it? What feels missing? Tech Chess? Yes, Tech Chess. I think I want a little bar here as well Windows too. Windows, the bar, the light at the front I will make the light actually work like a light. I think that would be very fun Dude, the light looks so weird. What the hell? It's just a fucking square I'm at least gonna put it in the train I'm not copying this over. That looks really bad than the original. Front bumper should be wider I guess we can make it this wider No, I'm not gonna make an OT hack All right, let's add the bar here BitM render or some kind of vertex transparent emission texture There will be a light cone at the front and I will attach a light to it How long does this handle have to be? Has to be exactly as long as the distance between the two, right? So would that be this length? Yeah, right. This would be appropriate But this feels so short God, how could anyone ever play Mario Kart 2? I mean just the level where Mario is the superhero I don't know what the difference between Marvel and DC is Someone once told me that one is goofy and the other is like wannabe serious edgy But that doesn't make any sense either because then the examples they gave didn't work out I think superhero movies are like this symbol for consumerism to me Like the symbol for meaningless garbage fast food art It's like Funko Pop collections, you know what I mean? So It's not about the merch they make it's about what they stand for I don't know anything about Superman They're all just one category to me So  Hmm okay, I think this works minus the window we still need the window here So I'm trying to see how this looks like on the N64 but I don't know it's just a window Oh, I see I'm assuming that you're drawing coins now screen space got five two questions when you already have a bell mix for all billboards Couldn't you just use that one since you need to multiply with the transaction at least 400 That's what I did. That's what the original game does. Well, I mean, no, that's not what the original game does The on-chain game generates one per coin, but that's what the simple solution would mean But that is worse because now you have to load four vertices per coin thing and you need like three or four Comments and you have a new matrix That you need to put into the thing and you can't just take the matrix you have to actually copy paste it in RAM and then set the Translation and then put it there. So that's a bad idea Drawing them a screen space once is a lot faster. You save like almost 100 256 bytes of data per coin Let's train have the same colors maybe I'm not 100% sure yet But then why don't you use it for all billboards which other ones can I use it for So What solution So I wonder if maybe it makes sense to just Move these down here To save on the subdivisions I think so. It looks better at the same subdivision. So why wouldn't we do it? Yeah, the screens have spots I can't imagine I would have been against that If I had been against it then I probably misunderstood something about screen space quads I used to have a lot of trouble getting them to render right in old graphic plugins, but now in glider networks On java it didn't maybe back then. I still wanted to support java. I'm, not sure Hello cream teamer that is indeed right tomorrow it is christmas eve I don't even want to finish reading that  So i'm reading vitamins and cinnamon I don't even want to finish reading that i'm already taking psychic damage So Can you believe it guys christmas just a week away How old were you exactly when you implemented the self-modified golden first row mac you mentioned you were a kid in your latest video I think I was 17 That was my first time really like programming though Oh, look, this is the exact text that I used it's a texture from the train But what kind of window texture do we want to use is the question Meow meow meow meow meow Meow No, I had never even touched programming when I was 13 I only want to have racist native american stereotypes on this cover, but actually we won't We won't because I'm that much of a good guy, but actually just because I don't even want that in the level I just specified God damn it I could have just taken it. I could have just been like, yeah, i'm i'm such a good guy I would never portray native american people Which i'm not sure if that makes you a good guy, but yeah We're just making cowboys See, okay my vision for this is, you know, how there's weeaboos And they take japanese culture and they completely overdo it. I'm doing that to american culture the cowboys We want to just a hundred percent cowboy this like we we move to the cowboy slider all the way to the right And then we keep going We're going as cowboy as we can possibly be So And followed for not putting native americans in here No, but genuinely there's no reason to have random political controversy like Cowboys like indians in here it'd just be stupid And as you you said you were programming oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, actually I did do some ti basic, but that's barely programming. That's like scratch programming So my real first programming was assembling I would say I like this texture for the windows, but we gotta we gotta do some stuff to it The original windows were yellow what color do we want for this year? I will not invent a cowboy in the slider now Check your discord Wait the train is literally included in the file. Oh fuck someone's just the end We can actually just take the market seven train Oh, this is the goombas in the trench coat, I actually wanted five goombas, but yes this idea works well If we can literally just take the textures from this model we should do that Mario will not say yeehaw instead of yahoo in this level, but i'm thinking of adding a yeehaw thing A voice line for the ground punch jump It's a dae file, okay And a pile of five goombas true true There is a joke somewhere there Oh my god, this is beautiful Minus detector glitches So I'm not gonna record the voice by myself and the fuck So Man detectors are so good looking Maybe we should use this train after all Can I do the ER? Sure, send me the voice clip. I'm not gonna laugh at it, I promise. I think we should just take some of the textures and not actually the 3D model. I really like the top part here. Who's Arthur Morgan? The only Arthur I know is Arthur Tilly. Maybe. Nah. Let's try 128x32. This looks good to me. Merry Christmas Eve. This may be inspiration. Oh, the train tracks looks nice, but doesn't work for my purposes. Honestly, this looks pretty good. I really like the floor. A standoff? Dude, yes, we definitely want a standoff. But instead of a normal standoff, actually what we'll have is a standoff of the five Goombas. Just the standoff doesn't really... There isn't really any gameplay. Sure, the vibe is there, but there's no gameplay. Oh yeah, that's sexy. That's what the word looks means. I must have said something really stupid. I don't know what you're referencing. Did I say looks twice? Okay, but I want to do a remake of a Remake you've done before if I had infinite time. Sure, but I do not. Time is limited. We're all slowly dying. I gotta make what I can. Okay, so I think this is the roof in the original. Hmm, I don't want to copy that. Hello, B-Turk. You just watched a new video about Course Code? That's good. Is the video doing well now? The video was doing dark shit earlier, but now it's slowly doing alright. That's good. Dude, 11% impression click rate. Why is the video doing so poorly? Everyone's watching this. Everyone's clicking this. Why is it doing poorly? Unbelievable. Yeah, I'd rather you just fucking shoot me than remake Last of Us. I have all my stuff in German if I can. Because I do not want to unlearn German. Mein Kanal. What else can we use from this texture? I don't like that the window texture is so small. AI upscaling? Anyone? AI upscaling? Shall we do it, actually? Maybe I can use this part here. Like the whole thing and then just save the two triangles. We should probably have everything be CI force just for memspeed. And... I don't think that people don't watch this though, Biobank. Because 11% impression click rate is really good. Giving a lecture about programming is a good way to make someone face out. But people love this shit. No, no, no, look. You can't tell me that this is bad analytics. 11% click through rate? That's insane. 8 minute play time? That is also insane. Just the views are average. It doesn't make any sense. There has to be just no one's on YouTube. That has to be what it is. If you look at this, what's your impression click rate? I don't know where to see it. 5%? Half of that? I'm not advertising on Discord. Who do you think I am? You know who advertises on random other people's Discord? Freaking... No. Shit. I think we can maybe downscale this without downscaling it. If you know, you know. Shit. Kind of like that, but better. Is it here? 66, so two more. Maybe because it wasn't really linked. But everyone's clicking on it. That's the thing. It's just not being shown to anyone. I think I know what's going on. The YouTube algorithm detected, hey, this video is not Mario64. This is not what its audience usually watches. So what the algorithm did is it didn't show it to everyone who usually watches me. So my subscriber count mattered less in this context. And then what's probably happening is this video is being sent to a lot of people. And a lot of people are actually engaging with this video and watching a lot of it. So my prediction is going to be that right now it's doing poorly. But in 24 hours, it's going to do insanely well. Okay. Do you want to see that? Do you want to see if my prediction is right? Oh, and that's also a factor. People just sending the video to their friends. Oh, good music. Blender never crashes for me. If Blender crashes for you, that might be your driver or you. I've had one person say it keeps crashing with them, but that was just Blender, not Mario64. Howdy, Hedgehog. Are you going to answer my question? No. You haven't thought to save? Hotkeys CTRL S. I save literally every two seconds. You don't even see that when I save. Do people like Sonic Unleashed now? I thought people hated Sonic Unleashed. I never cared about it, never played it. I think Sonic games are just absolutely terrible. I have kind of given out on the blue hedgehog. He has not been impressing me. At this point, I'm thinking Sonic fans have some kind of Stockholm syndrome. His last good game was in like 1996, something like that. No IGN and the other early influences hated Sonic Unleashed? Oh, I see. You think Sonic Mania was good? Damn. That's a hot take. That's a cool take. What? I have not played Panasonic. Isn't that a TV? Are you trolling? Are you ignoring me on purpose? What are you talking about? The hell? Okay, so if you have a question and you need me to answer it, just ask the question. Do not ask why I'm not answering your question. Do not ask if you can ask a question. Just fucking ask the question. It could be that easy. Case, can I ask a question? You know what's even worse? And I only recently realized this. Some people ask, can I pick your brain? Which is just like they want to ask if they can ask a question, but like they're hiding it. You know what I mean? I only recently realized this. Yeah, I like this. Hello, Sour OG. Dude, we have 140 viewers. What is going on? Do people in Germany say like that too? People in Germany say, I have a question, which means I have a question. And then they ask the question. No, I'm not working on the first person shooter anymore. I was making that as part of a commission, but that kind of just died down. I don't think I want this to have three stripes. I'll just keep it like this. Unless I can clamp S. Oh yeah, oh yeah, I like that. Hello, how are you? Can I have some of your time? I wanted to ask a question. I'm not sure I have to answer, but here goes. Hello, how are you?    Dude, dude, dude, what you're saying. Let me show you the messages that I get from Payoneer. So Payoneer is the website that I use for Patreon payouts. And they have the worst customer support of all time. Let me just find one of these extreme messages. Let's see, what is this? Thank you for connecting Payoneer customer care. This is Seth. I hope this email finds you well. Okay, I don't care. I have received your email asking for help. Okay, I don't care. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. If you want. Wait, no, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. There's worse ones. There's worse ones. Let me show you the worst one. This. Yes. Thank you for contacting Payoneer. My name is Arvi. I am one of the customer care. I would like to use this chance to provide my sincere attention and assistance with your request to make an account. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I understand how frustrating this can be. And I know the urgency of your concern. Rest assured that we are here to help you. And then something actually useful. No, wait. We appreciate your business and will do our best to accommodate your needs. Please note blah, blah, blah. We said. Yeah. They just keep going and going. Docs saying Ernie. Dude, that's not even his real name. We all know that's not his real name. There's no way they give you their real name. They spent like 15 sentences soothing you before they get to the point. Yeah. You know what I think the problem is? I think the problem is that high school teaches you to write like that. Do you sort some of the points in batches? Yes. The problem with sorting and or the reason to sort of matches actually is to sort them by texture. That's the only point that sorting and batching really has. I mean, it's gonna be great if it levels up other rum hacks as well, but I'm not gonna cripple myself just for other people. I don't really care about raising the skill floor, I care about raising the skill ceiling. Nah, there's gonna be people mad about it. There already are people mad about it. I mean, okay, there's one part I can understand mad about being, and that's like other hackers are being told to use my optimizations, which, you know, makes sense, it would improve your was a lot, but at the same time, you're now gonna have to deal with like this complete fucked up hard to understand thing. So I can see why someone wouldn't want to do that. How does Mario end up in a wild west after leaving Bozo? He walks. You hate that I love Scarlet Violet? Don't make sense. I would hate it too, if I liked that game. This is red in the game originally, maybe we should actually just do something like that. So you said you enjoyed it, how's the BDSP? I don't know. I don't think I enjoyed BDSP. In the illustrious tapestry of our discourse, might I beseech thee to entertain an inquiry of questioning nature? God damn it, shut up. I enjoyed a Pokemon Switch game. I like Legends Arceus. I'm not reading all that red shit. No way, you didn't even read that, you just wrote an AI, you just asked an AI to write it for you. Those words have never touched a human finger. Why do we even bother with Pokemon anymore? Because we so desperately want it to be good. I think that the first few Pokemon games are just like a magical experience for a young child. See, when Legends Arceus came out, I thought, oh my god, this is such a cool idea to move the Pokemon series towards. And this wasn't even the main game they worked on. Does that mean the new game will be like a good version of this concept? This is like a proof of concept for something actually good to come. And then the next game came out and I was like, oh my god, this is fucking dog shit. What the fuck were they doing? Like did they eat paint? Don't just paint, it's good food. Spoken like a Game Freak employee. Yernys eats chapstick? Maybe she shouldn't. Some paints healthy for you to eat? I'm sure you wouldn't know. Did you see the recent Zelda interview drama? And what do you think? The Zelda interview drama? The hell? What is a Zelda interview drama? This is new to me. Did one of the Zelda directors say some crazy shit on interview or something? It's called Food Calling Truth. The director is saying people have skill issue if they don't like open world Zelda. That seems like a crazy take. Why would you want to go back to linear Zelda? You have to be nostalgic to like them. Honestly, for Ocarina of Time, I think it is rated a lot higher than it deserves to be from nostalgia. But it's still good. And like, I don't know, I think I would prefer Twilight Princess over like Tears of the Kingdom. Tears of the Kingdom feels almost mentally abusive to me. Where instead of giving you a game, they're giving you like a fetch quest. Of course, the other open world games are a lot worse with that. But that's kind of like not typical of a Zelda game to just give you a fetch quest like that. All Zeldas are like that? I don't think so. Oh, we're out of Wild West songs. What's next in our playlist? Any other Wild West? Oh, what's that? Not at all. Yes, yes, yes. But it's still an adventure that you get them in. And Tears of the Kingdom, what I mean is, how do I put this? Let me think of the right words to say this in. Let me put on Mario Western songs, surely I'll find something. Nintendo Western songs? It's Dennis. No, most people like Tears of the Kingdom. Okay, what are the right words to put this? The way you play the game, you kind of just, everywhere you go, there's something for you to collect. There's some amount of extrinsic motivation. And there's very little intrinsic motivation in a game like that. At least that's how I feel about it. So in a way, even though the puzzle solving mechanisms give you more freedom than ever, the actual concept of the game feels less free to me. Because it's just, you just go somewhere. Like, the freedom that the game gives you feels meaningless to me. I feel like I'm ant collecting sugar and not really like playing a game. It has the most intrinsic motivation to you? Really? I mean, in a way I can see that, yes. Just through like, the way it allows you to solve puzzles. But apart from that, like, I really like the puzzle solving mechanics, don't get me wrong. I think the physics are like the absolute best part of that game. That's the one thing I like about the game. But like, the open world concept, where everywhere you go you find some extrinsic reward, that doesn't work for me at all. I think Tears of the Kingdom's dungeons are very safe. And that they are designed in a way that you can't possibly get frustrated with them. And that's why they're easy to enjoy. Unique solutions must bring me in more than multiple solutions? You think intrinsic motivation is overrated? Okay, but if intrinsic motivation is overrated, you could just be doing chores all day and you would forever be happy. That's like the extreme example of something that's purely an extrinsic motivation, doing chores. Hold on, make way, in case we're hitting my lady hat, cause we're working on a cowboy level. Howdy partner. Tears of the Kingdom's multiple solutions are unique and variety? Yes, there's a lot of solutions, but really it doesn't feel like puzzles anymore, it just feels like platforming. I don't think I ever thought at all while playing the game. I just did whatever I felt like and it always worked. We need a higher res version of this texture here, I think. Actually, no, we don't. Actually, yes, we do. We can just apply this here and then put the red 64 in the middle. It only helps if the job is intrinsically interesting though. Well, yeah, that would be intrinsic motivation, I guess. OT Water Temple is the best dungeon in the entire game? That is a very hot take. My favorite part of Tears of the Kingdom is basically empty and I only walked around with no light seats and I had a lot of fun. That's also a crazy take. The underground is actually what made me just realize that I don't want to play the game anymore. That was at the end though, like when we were in cleanup mode. I just realized how boring it was. Where is the 64 here? Anyone see a 64 just floating around somewhere? Extrinsic and extrinsic must balance each other out. That's not true. There are games that are almost purely intrinsic like Minecraft. I work a full-time job extra. No, there's no 64 here. Top left. Oh shit, there is! Good catch. Oh, but it's so small. The hell? It's way too small. We can't use it. We need a 64 on blue and red background. Yellow 64 on blue background. Red. Hello, too long, didn't watch. I feel like the only person who enjoys CSGO is him. I feel like everyone loves it. Well, some people don't like extrinsic motivation, I guess. But that doesn't mean it's everyone. I mean, I personally need an excuse for extrinsic motivation. To play the game at all. To like find new stuff. So for me, Minecraft doesn't work either. You could call the pedophile for liking Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. Who are you talking to? They added boss fights and stuff. Minecraft seems extrinsic. Okay, I did not know that. Do I not have a single texture that just says 64? Goddamn. What if we just take it from the Mario 64 logo? We should just take it from here. This is the best one. It's text, just make it. That's a fair point. Okay, it's yellow on red background. That should be easy enough to do. But the grayscale texture. This is gonna be the most HD ever. Your reasons for loving it are controversial, why? What kind of fucked up reasons do you have? Do you use Pygame to code? I am not Pygaming. The train from America does have the logo, but it's so low resolution that it just doesn't look good. Dude, this looks like the fucking McDonald's train. Anyone else think of McDonald's because of the colors? I don't like that this looks like McDonald's. That's only 182 triangles. Which is pretty good. Red and yellow is indeed McDonald's. Did you know that some people in Germany refer to McDonald's as McDonald's? Now you know. Yeah, making the yellow more gold should be fine. Oh God. The hell? Why is this so weird? Tania Retro Gaming, hello! What's that song you posted? Is this a song request? Alright. Alright. This is very sassy music, Tania. Drink water.. Keep missing anything Okay, enough of that We have to cancel the song unfortunately, this is not stream safe, there are little kids watching What are you hearing? Yes, you are hearing the bubonic plague Oh You're 12 and not a kid anymore I I don't know man. I think I think you need to be like 12 and a half at least. Oh Wait, actually, there's a twitch rule that you have to be 13 to watch twitch. So if you're actually 12, I Actually know you're on YouTube. Nevermind, you're fine Just so you know if you are under 13 you have to watch me on YouTube Can you say Japanese Yes, that's me Oh god, oh bah bah bah bah bah bah, that's awful what happened Why is this going on That's better I Client is cheaper than I thought who's client What what are these random links you guys are sending me who is client Play on these pods. That's clearly not what it's at And I'll build a Bosque and ratify Wait, what's wrong with YouTube kids? What is happening on YouTube kids I Just in general content More else I get direct it's direct of what that you just say in English now The German culture just infiltrate English culture now, is that why you say direct I Have never watched skippity toilet I'm not sure why it's popular at all I Have just never been into the goofy tf2 animation stuff Never did anything for me I That's half life not you have to see I didn't even know that It's probably because of kids, okay, but everyone I hear talking about skippity toilet is not a kid I just hear adults talking about it. I don't believe the story that skippity toilet is made for kids. I think It's made for Millennials and I actually think that almost everything that people say is getting gen alpha stuff is Actually, just like Millennials pretending. It's gen alpha stuff. This is like when boomers decided that everyone eats Tide pods We're being the new boomers here, that's my impression I Okay, I think the train is beautiful, holy shit look at this Some are being worked on the train Hey, somebody should learn about this I never in my life have a you know, I'll talk about skippity toilet. Oh, okay. Maybe I'm wrong Are we missing anything Maybe the hole in the middle I should also bake some more lighting in here. But other than that, I think it's good. Yes, the train will move Let's bake some more lighting into this I Have never been much of a YouTube poop fan either. I'm like one or two funny ones and that's it Although I know people that are still into YouTube poops or at least I know one guy who started a YouTube poops and I honestly I admire this man's dedication to the YouTube poops He's just been a fan of it consistently since 2006 Yes, it's very Tony of his island And yeah, that will be smoke I think I'm planning one car attached to it just for more to jump on They used to be just racism nonsense now, they are not anymore at least that's my perception Just in case we already have to call him just to train somewhere I Mean properly ground this That's a beautiful train What does Western text look like I forgot one thing What was even wrong with the original 64 looks so much better there this one here You think this looks better I Mean maybe I do need to shading and stuff. We can try coloring it in a little bit Where is it? I think I could go with some shading The leftmost one. Oh, that's not a texture. That's a 3d model This one right here that's all a 3d model that's not even a texture we can't just use that But yeah, I agree this looks like shit You Why is this not working Okay, what if we just made a whole new one this sucks I Get this fund is terrible by a bank, which was the fund you told me to use You What's the good Mario fun called Just bevel and contour. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I want to do. I'm just trying to actually do that right now A Super Mario 256, that's not it, right? That's the bad one. I installed the font. You told me to use Super Mario I Should probably make this on a 32 by 32 actually or 32 by 64 I Okay, you said just contour and emboss You Just emboss doesn't work You This is not what it's supposed to look like right or is it I That's still not really good Hello to barriers, I am random person on the internet Like a ball train cars, you know Like between the other models, that's the 3ds model. Yeah, 3ds model and smart code 8 And we're trying to do like an upgraded version of the 64 model It doesn't look as good as this though, like the effect is not there this looks free more more way more like 3d How did I get to do it to look 3d I Mean, I could do it in like an actual 3d modeling tool, but not like this Make it wider make what wider this Oh You can do that What the hell can I get the opposite of this This deal ab straighten effect Oh, I see. I think this is kind of what I want. I don't like the random floating pixels here. Why is there so much noise in these pixels? The hell? Do I have a noise filter on? I don't see a noise that I've activated. Maybe it's because of the highlight mode is being weird. God, why is it so ugly? Okay, I can't get it any better than this. I'm just gonna hope Biobank fixes this. This is the best I can do with Photoshop. Making a 3D model and pre-rendering that would be overkill right now. Okay, Biobank says do not worry, he will make it better later. I will believe him. Let's get the render distance of the... Oh shit, it's way too small. It's way too small. Okay, how big should this be compared to my room? It should probably be as big as this one wheel here is what I'm thinking. So this needs to be five times as big. Instead of a thousand we'll use 650. 610. All right, let's try it. The 64 looks great. We have the first person who is not a hater in chat. Let's celebrate.  yippee, Fortnite on cola. So is this more like Mario 65? Well, the guy that made the Mario 65 romhack is kind of a piece of shit, so we can't call this Mario 65 because otherwise I'm gonna run the risk of someone thinking that was me and I'm not the guy that made Mario 65. So Super Mario 66. That's a little small, don't you think? It looks beautiful though. It's just very small. It's the drama. Yeah, there's a very good drama video made by Skelenio. You should watch it. It's a toy train for Christmas. It is, kind of. So How are you so productive? You can just sit down and work. Case Emunar. He's 2.2 death. Does it need to be much bigger than this? I feel like this is almost the size I want. Marketing stack looks good as fuck. The world looks a little bit bugged. I think scale is up by another 25 percent. And what is 915 divided by 4? 225 422 922 9. That's 1144. Oh yeah, I like this. That's a good size. But I do need to move the bars a little to the side. Dude, let's enjoy this for a bit. This music. Yeah, Mario's cat bounces with the gravity. Hmm. We need to move him further. Can Mario pick up the tumbleweed? No, but you can kick it. Where is it? I missed it. There's so much tumbleweed here. There, I kicked it. It really needs a shadow though. Of course it's gonna move. Yeah, this is all made from hardware. I tested this level, or last time I tested this level. This level ran pretty stable, 40 to 50 fps. And we haven't even optimized it yet. But the level is also still early on, so the performance is gonna get worse if we make more stuff. I think this might work now. Do they just tumble infinitely with no friction? Yes, but they disappear after a bit and then they respawn. New song requested earlier. Okay, let's see what we got. Very unfitting. Yeah, that works. I think I'm gonna make the wheels more 3D. That's gonna look good actually. Wait, this is a sick idea. Let me do that to all of the wheels. This slaps. This definitely goes hard on Mew. Fun fact, did you know that actual train wheels are shaped like this? Have you ever thought about how a train can actually take curves? It's because their wheels are pyramids. Now you know. Okay, before we can reasonably program the train, we need the train tracks to work fine. Oh god, what happened to the train tracks? Oh, I didn't know this was going on. Wait, what the hell? How? It looks fine here and then in-game it's this. Okay, we can't program the train yet. Because we need the collision baked for that. And to bake the collision, we need to finish the level. That's gonna be at the end. Mr. Song Request, what's the song request? Is it Neowim's message? All right, I'll listen to it. The hell? I'm thinking this is gonna be a big money bag here. And then there's gonna be the top with the money bag just coming out. You know, it's in Mario Party. And then in front of the bank, we're gonna have a big gold nugget. Like stuck in the ground here and here. And you can walk on the gold nugget. Hello, you know. This guy has such a German synchronization voice. I swear I've heard this guy's voice before.  Nugget or gold bar. Like this. Haha, what a fucking song. That's a bouillon. Okay, it's a bouillon. Guys, we made a bouillon. Stop calling it gold bar, guys. It's a bouillon. Okay, I'm gonna steal the big nugget. Just watch me. And another inside the bank says the guy outside is trying to steal the cardboard nugget again. That would be very funny. Unfortunately, I don't think we can make it so you can go inside the bank. But we can absolutely have the pickaxe NPC and someone else referencing the dialogue. Now how could these nuggets make sense? What if you just place three nuggets like a pyramid? I think that works for a bank. Is Yoshi's Island still running on a gold standard or is there a banking system? I don't think money exists here. They just pretend because they saw it in movies. They can already be used to stairs like this. Google gold nugget real quick. Okay, gold nugget. What am I supposed to see here? I don't understand. Another song request. Oh no. Yeah, it's a gold bar. No, no. I wanted the bar on purpose. This has more old west vibes to me. Okay, this is clearly a parody song. Let me just make sure you can actually get on the building. Right, it's a bullion. Stop calling this a nugget or gold bar. It's a gold bullion. No, he's really serious. Nah, this is clearly a troll. Dude, next time I meet a person in real life and they talk about gold bars or gold nuggets, I'm gonna tell them about bullions. The tank to your heart. There's no way the guy is serious. It's very clear troll. Yeah, you can get up here. We can still make the bank shorter too. Probably will actually. So it's clearly a pile of gold bullions you mean. Anyway, I think we're done for today. We got the train done. I'm gonna finish the bank next and I will see you guys in the next stream. I still got a week of vacation so maybe I can stream again sometime next week. I'll see you guys. Bye bye.
