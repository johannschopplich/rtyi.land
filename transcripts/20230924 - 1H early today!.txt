Time to start streaming! Stream time! Gotta wait till more people come and chat Because I gotta show something cool off to them Wait, why is my stream set to not listed? Yeah, I can't find your stream anywhere What the hell? Did I mess it up? What did you do? I'm not sure I hope I'm not streaming on my main channel Oh, there you are, I see you now It's on Case Clips? It's on Case Clips Good Ah, that sucks How do I find a link to my stream so I can post it? You don't know? No, but I'm just gonna post the share link Just post it in the stream In the stream? Yeah, so I can find it There you go You said post it in the stream Yeah, it just took a bit Hello Hello Christian Hello Christian Bale No, just call him Christian That's what he gets for that name It's a very funny name So while I have a minute, do you have any animations you want me to do real quick? No Have you finished the cart? The... The cart? Oh, the wedding cart Not yet Well, you need to, you have one hour left That is true So I'm not gonna be fully on stream today I'll just read my chat So we're working on the boss for this level today And unfortunately I have to eat on stream Really sucks Hello Bioback Hi Bioback I had a cool new idea on how we can maybe increase the FPS But my first attempt at it didn't work So it's gonna be a bit... I think You have an idea for that unused song? What is it? Hello Jimmy John Joe Did you guys see my implementation of the fast square root? Or inverse square root? There's only one Asian looking area in the game And it's a dojo What if after you get all the stuff here you're like, hmm, what's the movement you have? The grand trial you may attempt See, that is really cool We have a problem though That song is huge It's gonna take up like 5 megabytes of ROM space And... We don't really have that space But I like that idea for how the final challenge should start That would be really cool Yeah, we don't even know that the dojo will still be in there in the end We'd have to turn it into a midi And then it would work Right now it's a WAV file How many people do we have in check right now? How many of you are here? 20 20? Why? Because I want to show off the wedding gift that I made Yeah Hi Lila Hello Lila I'm very sorry that I have to eat on stream But it's been so early that we didn't manage to get food ready before the stream So you guys can see me eat rice and chicken Huge occasion It's Lebanese chicken and rice And it is objectively the best chicken and rice Thank you I'll put the Evangelion OST on whenever I want to get banned off YouTube, Biobank When does the stream end? I'm not sure yet Probably it will only be a 2 hour stream Because we have to go to a wedding I hate weddings It's gonna be awful I wish I could just bring my DS like a little child and play my DS on there Do you want to bring mine? I'll bring it with me if you want No, all DS games suck I put new ones on All DS games suck You're such a baby You're so picky This phone sucks Lila, he usually just uses mine And even then, most mobile games are just kind of awful You get some good ones here and there But most of the time the fun runs out after like 2 minutes There was a really good Sonic game on the mobile thing But turns out that unless you pay a shit ton of money you have no chance at actually competing So I hated it after a while Wedding food is great, maybe We'll see Actually the last wedding we were at, the food was bad The cake Okay, they said they have cake You know what they had? They didn't have cake They had a single slice of bread with cream and a strawberry That's not cake That's a slice of bread with cream Chat, let me clarify, it was strawberry shortcake And he hates anything that isn't chocolate cake Strawberry shortcake That's a very very generous name for a slice of bread with cream on it It was cake It wasn't bread It's just cake that you don't like You'd eat that But there was like no food I left hungry They said the food was gonna be at 6, the food was at 8 And it wasn't food The chicken was really good It was like a fifth of a portion I think I spoiled him, I gave him like a mountain of food every day Simply eat the bride You know, I was pretty close to doing that Chat, what if Liz and I had our wedding part 3 and we liked it? I don't want the third wedding You know what our priest said? Rule number 3 Tell me your wedding had 250 grams of unseasoned chicken and rice for all guests Am I a picky eater? I mean, I'm kind of picky You're very picky But I also need like a huge amount of food I can't just leave off the portion of like a 10 year old girl See, this is why I just gave him a mountain of food today Because I know that he might go hungry And that's why I made that big thing of chicken and rice Oh yeah guys, I also recently became a hater of the inverse square root algorithm I don't think it's as good as everyone says I'm sorry I mean, okay, it's really cool But the quake version, I'm a hater for that one Because like the trick to use the exponent and the bits of the floats To basically be like half of the logarithm of the floats Damn, that's really cool But like, all the optimization they did around that has been ass They have 3 constants and they only optimized one of the 3 constants How do you do that? Oh god, wait Did something bad happen to my animations? Anyone else think Mario looks suspiciously 15 FPS right now? 30 FPS? Is it just me? He is? Damn Yeah, he definitely is Why is it 30 FPS? God damn it I don't know why he has 30 FPS again This is actually Silas' code He gave me a new version of this that is supposedly a lot faster But it does not seem to work Let me check if I still have the old version on Github Desktop Cool art style? Wait, what? Where? Come on, Github Desktop, please load Oh Yeah, it's like that new Spider-Man movie We are putting this at half FPS to show that he hasn't mastered his movement yet What a fucking code I don't think I even watched that Dude, why is this not loading? Oh my god I watched the first Resident Evil and thought it was really good I really like it It's very artistically pleasing What the fuck? Okay, I'll be honest, when I watch a movie, I don't think at all about how the animators felt doing the job I do not care It is not my responsibility to care I only really get curious about that if a scene is very weird to look at Dude, what? Oh my god Okay Don't worry about the double promotion stuff, that's just a test suit Yeah, that's back to 30 FPS, isn't it? Oh, but there's some weird stuff in here Like that This is not at all what it was supposed to be Wait, let me just get the old version I put in here Okay Here we go This is what I had Okay, no compiler Oh, DjangoMax is missing, oh of course That actually makes sense Let's see if this works fine again Hello Sonic the Hedgehog Yeah, okay, now it works again Okay, I'll let Celes know Okay Can you make a better hex? Sure Try not to break everything? No Anyway We are supposed to fix this So he's supposed to move This is his first attack where he's supposed to just move that Mario forward And then if he is too far away, he should go back to normal  Unused value I'm right here, Lula, I just had to run up to the car I got this wrong Interesting That explains some things Come on, let me hide Grab my bra Okay It was on action state 2 for 1 frame, that's fine It's supposed to be Action state 1 is supposed to work though, oh god He just starts living in Spain Am I saying it all different here? It's more oily, that's why Can you make an Mario operation? I am capable of doing that But I will not Okay, what if instead of this we just do the approach angle thing? That seems a little more reasonable and more functional And makes more sense too, I think And angleValPitch should just be zero Oh, it's already set to zero, good Let me also uncomment the test suit, because I don't want to get all these errors here all the time It's a bit annoying, or 1x rather Unused variable at line 1,000 Oh, true Like you know, I was gonna plan to do that only for the big three bosses, not for everything But maybe as like a final polish we add that for every boss, I think that'd be very cool Okay, okay I see He's not rotating to Mario fast enough, and he's not going fast enough Okay The black one left 2048 health Or actually 2047, so it's a bit of a weird boss Okay, we've got some people in the chat So I have something to show off to you guys. I worked very hard on this all week. My hands were in pain But this right here Is our little wedding present to my friends Isn't he gorgeous? What if they're watching the stream? What if they're watching the stream? But look at him Here, you eat. I'm gonna just put him on camera here. Look I finally learned how to use a sewing machine too I almost don't want to give him away Keep him. No, I can't. This is a wedding present. We'll get a $15 GameStop gift card on the way They can have that What's $15 gonna buy you at GameStop? Do you know how expensive GameStop is? If you put your old Switch together with the $15 gift card, maybe you can get a new game I don't want to give away my Switch Also, they would like under they would If I were to sell my Switch at GameStop, they wouldn't give it to me for they wouldn't sell it Buy it for a reasonable price Okay, let's gift them an NFT Dude, there's probably real people out there that had an NFT gifted to them for their wedding Think about it probably happened So What's your NFT Lilo? Lilo's NFTs? Okay, I'm sold I Have seen some cabinet stuff, yeah I Think hard setting the position like this is never gonna work I do not stink like a poop I Maybe I do smell like a wild animal but not like a poo She's laughing because she knows that's a joke I smell like flowers good flowers You smell like chicken and rice What That's what I have smells like Okay, you heard it guys I smell like chicken and rice Chicken and rice Imagine a wedding that you eat McDonald's If I had like a fuck ton of chicken nuggets, I don't think anybody would complain And the artifacts and there's a button combination for it, I don't know what it is we just keep pressing it I Anyone know that feeling There's a button combination and you press it but you don't know what it is I Looking at the keyboard is for nerds. Oh, it's for the opposite of nerds, right? I All right, let's see if he stops walking now Dude recently I feel like I have been evolving. I'm just getting so much better at everything for some reason. I don't know how Okay, we do need to reduce this forward velocity here a little and Maybe not doing like that And what programming gaming lifting weight This is a bit small What a small hello alast The room you wanted to make it I thought it was pretty big So Oh, it's because this forward velocity is still big here It should be approaching zero velocity pretty quickly So Two is enough What is the music in the background Pokemon So right doesn't look like it's trying to hit corners How I see You You want the room roughly the same size but like have it be A little Like the platforming is the same size, but the room itself is a bit smaller I think it won't look like it's hitting corners. It's also going to go down a bit when it approaches you like this So the perceived amount of space will be a lot bigger So To see it phasing through platforms, but it's made out of oil that's like its whole thing it can just move through it So The tiny car dude, I remember that fight that is the fight that made me quit donkey kong 64 Because it was so fucking boring Are we approaching a home by anywhere? Oh nice That's pretty good Which I'm aiming the To look at thing. Oh, I see It's so hard to read comments on youtube sometimes because there's the heart button that lets you put emojis Okay, I need to look at the guy while he does that So Come on protect me bitch I think that's pretty good Wait, he didn't even try to attack me there What that was that? I guess he does need to rotate a lot faster at the beginning  Maybe there should be a startup of the attack where it just rotates towards mario So Isn't liquidy enough what It's that bluffing of music island that's called gargantua block or neb enid somehow the red and the blue one have different names entirely So Um, actually I think 100 is enough Actually, I think he should be looking at mario at all times Let's Let's remove this Have it like this and then I guess now he's always looking at mario This should do it we just desync the two states So All catching on fire maybe You don't think the vertex displacement here is fine leila I kind of like it Okay Oh, no, he doesn't look like me at all what the hell Oh  What the fuck oh I see The name may be not as an anagram of neptune doron god of the sea what the fuck is this that's true though But I did not think of that I see leela So All right, what's with this facing mario it's not working, right It should be though It's true but why why would he be the god of the sea he's a fucking sentient pile of goon but he guards the sea See why isn't he turning to me that is weird Okay, the attack it move looks pretty good though So What is this he just And the metal bits vertex colored um, they're gonna be objects, so They are not colored at all yet By metal teeth. I think it looks very cool That's a very good idea by biomech Which i'll be back card is finished. All right. I just gotta go clean up the car All right. Oh the teeth. No, they have vertex alpha though So What you call me that live on stream, yes, what the fuck What are you gonna do about it, I don't know What are you gonna do trying to embarrass me? Yes God, damn it Love you. Bye. Bye Bye. Bye Love you, too I can't believe she's trying to embarrass me live on stream in front of everyone So Dude only minus six more years until star world comes out. I'm so excited Oh, oh I know what I did wrong And I used the oil block instead of the oil block boss. No wonder it didn't work. I wasn't even editing the relevant code I was editing the other code Look at this loser with a wife who loves him. What is he gay? Bet you like girls  Let's see how difficult it is to dodge him Okay, it's pretty difficult. I think it's too difficult. I don't think it should be this difficult. I mean, I did it, but normal people are not going to be able to. Is there a way to get the camera to focus on Morkmar? Actually, that's a good point. Hello, Sam. Oh, I don't like this. That is just pointing too high. Well I want this to be kind of in an oil barrel. This is the block slayer. I'm not eating chocolate and chicken. It's rice, beef and chicken and nuts. Honestly I think this is pretty playable. I kind of like it. What do you guys think? Dude, come attack me. It's only a bit weird when he attacks you like that. I think as soon as he attacks you, he should stop blocking you. Yeah, exactly. It's a lot easier to see the platforms like this and it's also a lot easier to see the block. And there's still the option to just, you know, turn it off. Oh, no, camera lock stays on when you turn off auto-rank late. I did not realize that. What do you guys think? I think this is a good to go. This looks so lifeless. You mean just the area in total? Hello, Hedgehog Gamer. Let's point the camera a little bit higher. If we point the camera any higher, the platforms are going to be so hard to see. Like this is already questionable platforming-wise. I think if anything we should move the block further down. Let's try moving the block a bit down. Hell yeah. Oh, nevermind. I can't see his eyes anymore. I guess let's move him even further down. I would like the block's eye to stay on here. Yeah, light sources might make this look a lot nicer. Okay, you're likely going to be far away from the block during most of the fight, like over here. So I think this mostly works now. Maybe I should make the block a little smaller. So you can see him better. Why does the camera point further down when the block is closer? Because it's pointing below him. If you look at it right now, it's pointing inside his stomach. We can make the camera point further up the closer he gets. I think that would work pretty well. Let's try that. How do I use a distance to Mario? I feel like I had a macro for it. What is my macro? Okay, let's just take the square root. Actually, no. We should get the lateral rest. Does Mario need it? If you can figure out what axis he's spinning, you can totally go for it. True. Make the platforms higher? Nope. They can't be higher, because Mario needs to be able to get on the soap and drive into him to damage him. Is it great after Z-pointing, just X and Y? No. We can make the platforms higher.  I feel like I had a macro for it.  I feel like I had a macro for it. Is it great after Z-pointing, just X and Y? I feel like I had a macro for it. Doing it like this kind of sucks. Hello, hello, hello. Starting the original position, I mean we can just back up all the data. That's not that big a deal. Still going too far down. Oh, wait, I guess I want this. And I think I'll make him ever so slightly smaller so you can see his eyes better. I don't want to get rid of the vertical camera rotation. Stop! That feels kind of nice. We kind of got this working. Oh, that looks really nice, I think. Now the question is, what is the penalty for falling into the oil? I don't want to make it too frustrating. Should you just take damage over time? Do you die instantly? No. It's been at the center with 1 HP. Maybe. Walk to hub, World 1, if you even go above 1000 soup. I think water with damage over time is perfect. That is my take on this. Alright, let's make an animation for the blocks attack. Mario moves slower until he shakes off the oil stuff. I don't want to program an oil effect onto Mario. I actually had a pretty big revelation today. And that is, that there's a problem with playing ROM-Mix. And that is that the player's expectation is that they can easily 100% the game. Because when you play a normal game like Mario Odyssey, Tears of the Kingdom or even Pokémon, with the literal slogan, catch them all, there's no expectation to catch them all. So that opens a lot of design space, where you can just put stuff that is hard to find, but feels really nice to find. We don't have that on ROM-Mix. We can't put hard challenges without people complaining. We can't put super secret hidden stuff without people complaining. And I think that really takes away a lot of design space. So... Why is that? And how do we solve it? Also, I like that idea as well, by the way. Why is there a bee in my room? Go away. The bee landed right on my hat. I have no food for you. Don't care about the community? Well, it doesn't really work. But I noticed that that's a thing that was holding back a lot of my hacks in the past. The fact that gamers expect to be able to 100% my game, and then they just haven't been. Just ignore the complainers? I don't like doing that. See, my philosophy is, what people feel, in a way, is real. You can't change that fact. But their reasoning is most of the time stupid. You should just ignore people's reasoning. But you can never really ignore people's feeling. And if their feeling is that they feel bad, because they want to 100% the game, but they can't, that's something that we have to counteract. Replace Mario's textures with the blarks? Yeah, but you have to fade that out over time. So you need to make a material that can somehow take both a little bit. Last Impact's secrets have not all been found yet. But all the stars have been, obviously. I think the secrets would be not too hard, but after the basic completion. If you comment just as much about official games, the comments are just much larger, and they mostly don't listen, don't care about the critics. But every time you do that, you get such bad reviews. My perfect example for this is Mario 64 Land. I don't know if you guys have seen this. But this. Basically, in this game, getting any percent, getting through the game, is pretty easy. And getting all A-Ranks is also pretty, like, it's reasonable to do. But then after all A-Ranks, there's 8 stars you can get for all S-Ranks. And the S-Ranks are kind of difficult. They are meant to be there as players that go really hard on the game. People that really want to find everything, that just love the game. But, if you look for this, there's like, yeah, this guy is complaining about 100%. This guy is complaining about 100%. And because of that, a lot of people are saying this game is bad. This guy was a pain to 100%. Why the fuck did you do it then? Get the heck 100%? See, this guy gets it. He liked it. I love and hate this guy. Don't go for S-Ranks, trust me. Yeah. But that's, like, the one thing that people really hate about this. The S-Ranks. And I think that's, like, the best thing about this. If you love the game, you get more of the game. That is an insane idea. Let's do that. Community post. When you play in Mario 64 mode, do you expect to be able to 100% it, or are you satisfied just getting most stars? 100%, any% and maybe, like, what's a good third option? Depends. What? Why is one of these answers already selected? I don't like this.  Any% depends. Play until I'm bored. Play until I'm bored. Alright, let's get the poll. Any chance we'll get a case James Lambert collab? Dude, I think yesterday I was actually talking to someone who makes a podcast about software engineering. And they asked if I wanted to host it or, like, be on the podcast. And in the end, the suggestion we had was that me and James Lambert on the podcast would, like, interview each other. So that would be kind of a collaboration and that would be really fun. That depends, well playing until I'm bored kinda depends, right? This is such a terrible function name. The Mario 64 decomp coding standards are just like awful. No strike? What do you mean strike? Oh, that looks so cool! Oh my god, I love that animation. 20 karat code standards? I don't know. Okay, the results so far are pretty devastating. So that design space is just closed off to us because of this expectation. Which really sucks, because I'd like to have that design space open. Hello, playman! You think he should move down more at first? Is that the idea, MarioBag? I can easily do that. Let me try this, actually. You might like this better. Okay, that's a very bad point by the way. Alright, let's slide a bit higher. Nah, needs to be higher still. Whoops. Come on, let me see it. Nom nom nom nom nom. Like that? Okay. I don't think I like it. Because I don't want the player to equip for a level. I never want the player to be in a level and then feel like, oh, I should leave this level and come back with a different set of equipment. I feel like that's a really bad thought to have in your mind. It's kind of similar to the reason I removed 100 coin stars. Because I don't want the player to find a star and be like, oh, I should leave and come back later. Tiny bit higher. Yeah, that seems reasonable. Yeah, but you added Yoshi coins. Yep, exactly. The Yoshi coins just save. You don't have to collect them all in one go. So you can collect them and you never have the thought of, oh, I need to leave and come back. Yes, Clayman. We actually do that in another level. Alright, let's see what the YouTube poll says. This guy is in chat. He's in chat. So you can swear and say in addition. They weren't supposed to solve that problem. Because I think ideally 100 coins are like you just exploring the level. Kind of like how it is in Mario Sunshine. But also, you should never be just leaving behind the collectible and coming back for it later. Don't be crying. They would just make the experience easier for lower skill players. Raid Arm Rage, No Void Death Badge, Extended Timer's Badge, Lowered Lava Damage. I see what you mean now. I mean, okay, the Lowered Lava Damage thing. That could still be like, oh, I need free Lava Bouncers to do my trick here. But I only get those if I have the Lava Badge, you know. Where did it first? Paper Mario did it in 1996. Ocarina of Time 64 did that like in 2014. I think I'm fine. Don't care, okay. Unlucky. Dude, something's been wrong with Robot recently. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but something's been really off. It's basically Easy Mode, but adaptable. A lot of players will not feel good about using Easy Mode, but they'll be much more comfortable with making one aspect of the game easier. Yeah, they will feel smart about it. The question is, how do we fit this in thematically? And... Okay, wait, actually. If we have these badges just be findable in the overworld, and then you can just select one of them as like a special perk. Like a single special perk. I'm kind of fine with that. But having this be like a whole badge menu, I think that's too much RPG for Mario 64. Hmm. Oh, nice, Clayman. Anti-Bias is generally easy. Yes. But imagine the following. You get a badge that makes Mario move 1% faster. Or, well, not like a badge, like a perk. You can pick that, or you can pick a perk that makes it so instead of void out, you just lose 1 health. So one's the Easy Mode, the other's the Hard Mode. And depending on what style of gamer you are, you're gonna go for what you want. Also, there's gonna be the advantage of like... Now, if it is difficult, you'll feel like, hey, it's difficult because I made this choice. I could have made a different choice. So it's my fault. Right, you don't blame the game, you blame yourself. Do I already have that? I don't have the void out thing right now. So I can't see what Biomech is saying. And the cool thing about that is that it gives more depth to the overworld, which is the thing I really want. You already respawned in Lufty Lumber Leaves? Yeah. Okay, it's not gonna be badge. No. If anything, it's gonna be a single perk that you can pick. And you will only get one perk at a time. I don't want you to build a custom character. The overworld should just be fun interaction? Absolutely not. The overworld needs to be full of secrets. That is so important. That's gonna make or break the game. Guaranteed. Okay. Hmm.  4 is 8-0. So 6. Okay. No, they don't all have restrictions. They have special missions. That doesn't work at all. And also, the Yoshi missions unlock as you beat the game. So you're gonna have the last challenge unlocked at 100 stars or something. No, Leela, a lot of them we already have. I've been eating this for an hour now. Okay. If this system were to exist at all, it needs to be stuff you find in the overworld. Hmm. The overworld should feel massive. And intricate.  And it'd be like something... No void outs. Higher spin jump. Something that has to make you go faster. You know, stuff like that. What's up, chat? I have returned. So bad players don't have to suffer for half the game before finding a perk that makes it more enjoyable. Well, the early levels... Think about it. The first level is baby easy. The second level is baby easy. It doesn't really get difficult until later on. It might still get a playable Yoshi, Leela. Okay. I am watching you in another streamer. Damn. You're also in a conference? Yeah. Maybe it might still happen in the overworld or something like that. Fuck them Bowser of the League. Not a Yoshi this time. I want my meatloaf. That is fucked up.  It's that Bowser fight League. Fuck. I don't know about a lot of cartoons being fantasy material. I just know about the funny Dan Schneider incident. Yeah. The Dan Schneider thing shouldn't be funny. But somehow it is. The man has just been producing teenage feed porn for years. Live on air in front of a million people. And no one ever thought to be like... Maybe this is not good. How did that happen? I have watched Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. How is that fetish material? That was my favorite TV show as a little kid. I would refuse to go to kindergarten unless my mom recorded the show for me. Did you know there is an official volume 2 game that became lost media? Google it. Not a joke. This is legit truth and you will not believe what the game is. No. That's not real. That's people falling for my video. Update on the poll. I think these are pretty conclusive results. What do I google? Waluigi lost media. Waluigi's toenail clipping party? But that's not an official game, right? What the fuck? No way. That's fucked up. What the fuck? What the fuck? This is gonna be his wave attack. It looks a bit weird right now but trust me I have a plan. So we need to make it so that the animation accelerates a little bit here. How are you doing location board changes that aren't the root? That is the root theoretically. It's a bit weird. Life is not about quits you know. That's what I think about Britain. That's everything if I hear ever a British person I just think of the first Harry Potter game and the NPCs going life isn't all about quits you know. Fucking British people. Alright, let's speed this up. This should do it. And then while the timer is less than 50 he needs to go down. Or multi animation frame. When we scale the sine wave to 10 frames, it should go to minus 1. So from 1 to minus 1, that's half a sine wave. So multiply by 10, no, 3277.5 divided by 10.5. That should do it. I'm so glad I can do math. Yo, Scalenio's back. Fucking Scalenio army, let's go. What was that animation? Have you guys seen my conversation with the number one Scalenio fan on Twitter? Have I ever shown that? There was a guy that tagged me and told me that I ruined his friend's life. I was like, what the fuck? What did I do? And then he said his friend is Scalenio and then I just posted a dancing Bowser gif. We had a lot of fun that day. I fear that I did not export the bug animation the first time. Let's try that one again. I still don't know how I ruined Scalenio's life. The guy said I did that by disrespecting Scalenio, but like, everyone disrespects Scalenio. What did I do differently? I swear to god that guy is no older, but he does that everywhere. And the guy's been doing that for like four years, I think. Okay so why does my animation not work at all? I thought I had made sure that my animation works with translation, but I guess not. Is this some ungodly Fast64 behavior? This should work, no? Why does it not work? I'm also worried that the other bug is fucked up too now. Because animation one was weird. Like what is this? That's not a valid animation. There's something really messy going on here. That's exactly three bones, should be fine. Why is the bone offset so low? It should not be. This doesn't look wrong. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it looks fine to me. Geoset animation callbots maybe? Nope, this is always set. It is definitely set to translation. Like yeah, it does do like a normal bone for us, but that should just not influence the animation at all. But it's also definitely not 83 frames long. No way. God damn it. I wasn't even running the animation. All right. I'm just now realizing that this should have been like 20.f. 20.f is not right, interesting. Oh, it might be because the other thing is also influencing this. So let's try just like a really big number. So the two forces cancel each other out. Yeah, it was garbage that I'm being read as an animation. Bite me. Isn't that what Meta Knight says in Brawl? Wait, why am I dividing by 40? It's supposed to be minus 40. My favorite 2D Mario, does Yoshi's Island count? I want him to go underwater. So this is not working for me. Let's just turn it off for a second. Oh, not this music. This reminds me of the awful rates from Scarlet and Violet. Dude, how are you the Pokemon company and you make fucking Scarlet and Violet? I'm so upset. It's actually so tragic what's happening to Pokemon. It should be minus, actually, not plus. And now we're slowly getting there. Yeah, they have been shit for long. And I mean, it's working for them. That's the saddest part. It is working. It was kind of just spazzing out. I don't like that. And he'll seem to bite him no matter how shit they are. Why would they feel that? Exactly. I mean, are they actually selling that well compared to other games on the Switch? Damn. Yeah. Yeah. I'm afraid to demand it. This is Yoshi's Island. No Super Mario Bros Wii. Trying too hard while barely trying at all. How are they trying to have what? They're not trying at all. Never. What? What are you saying? I think this might have been an issue with operator precedence. You're saying they're trying too hard while not trying at all? I don't see how that makes any sense. Yeah, why is he like this? He's seeing this shit? It's not supposed to be like that. I guess I'm computing this wrong. Oh right, the particle flex is zero at the beginning. So it should be this. And then, so we don't have to compute this twice, I'm just gonna put this here. Okay. So 7FF is like the most it can be. And this should be 7F, 3F, 1F, which is 31. Maybe a bit too low. I should just multiply this by something. Fuck it, who cares if it's gonna be a float. So 20 divided by 0x7FF is this number here. Can I have some marihuana? No, I'm not even gonna play it. I think I'll just wait until I have kids to play with them. Ah, there we go. That is what I wanted. I think it can go down even more. I think it would look good if it went down twice as much. Yeah, I like that. And this shits the way video. I don't even see, like, what you mean by vertex displacement either. Like, how would that ever look good? What kind of animation are we looking for here? Kids leak? We don't have any kids yet. And she's not pregnant either. We need a house first. Having kids without a house is just stupid. Either way, I think we're done for today. Unfortunately, I can't stream any longer because I have to go to a wedding. So I'll see you guys next week. I'm hoping that eventually I'm done with the banjo hack and I can go back to streaming twice a week. Saturday and Sunday. I think that'd be really cool. But for now, I can't. So I'll see you guys. Bye bye.
