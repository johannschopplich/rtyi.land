you you you you you Ah, ah, there we go Good old NVIDIA broadcast Hello Hans Mayer Any OST wishes you Terraria and calamity mod, you know on Terraria OST sounds fun I don't hear shit There we go, this is the Terraria song I heard this in so many YouTube videos That pathwavings was okay, nice Fortnite dance music OST, how does that go? Scribe only and deuce and booze Mozart Strasse 4 plus 4 never heard of that Anyway today we want to start decorating the overworld. That means we're gonna put more of the Yoshi villages around Before I put any Yoshi villages around I have to beat the first puzzle level Which so, okay. I was making sure everything works fine testing wise which is why I have a new save file here The first 24 stars work perfectly fine now, which is great but Because of that, I don't want to just cheat in the Bowser star because then I'm gonna forget to test it So we're gonna beat this legit Hans Mayer's theory regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk. No, I have not seen that. What is his theory? I Have decided just yesterday that I'm gonna read less news or politics because I find You're either misinformed or you're uninformed and I prefer being uninformed actually I Let out my inner youtuber Oh This level is working surprisingly well This is before biomextreme works, it's gonna look a lot better in the end. Don't worry Oh Okay, that's a big problem, I mean just trying to beat this again without going into the cannon I Mean only your two sons the Yoshi's That is indeed not supposed to happen You know, we're just gonna place down the Yoshi villager without getting the star that's fine How do you optimize if you talk about some time ago and if yes, did it save anything I have not Sorin was thinking of redoing the audio and then that was gonna be his project. I have not done it And he has not done either I don't know if he's working on it or not he is a very busy man You Hey, it's right on the oceans we have zero one two, okay, that's Zero green Former normal One like I Swear Yoshi you What else we have I am Lazy it's just you're supposed to have their own personality I'm using room manager. Not fast 64. Yeah, same way you do it and And wait what using Roman is a not fast 64 Yes, okay. You open your ROM you go to eight two three B six four and You will see around 36 numbers those are Morris colors I'm so correct, dude. I just know the number I'll show you We have a room somewhere When the hell would I have a ROM, okay, I don't have wrongs never mind Memorize the address dude I know like every address in the extended bar 60 forum and I haven't even edited in the accident or like seven years This is riding a bike. You never learn it You want me to give you a game shark code I can give you many game shark codes just off the top of my head I can just program in game shark like that One game shark code do you need I got you He's not a game shark cheating I'm just gonna be modular father and take safer games Mmm, I need you to define what an optimization is for me to really answer the question The principles of what I'm doing can be applied to any game and even like the engine design could be taken over At this point there's little more 64 engine design left over think There's holidays and I'm missing them Let's see, let's put the normal Yoshi here The cool Yoshi would be hanging out the wrong beach The intelligent Yoshi The attention Yoshi feels like someone I'm dying out around here at the top The crybaby My baby one here I Am planning to be at 0% intended quote at the end like no Nintendo code at all Project is on hold right now because I want to get overboard one ready for a beta test But after that, I'm straight back to it Just Recently, I reworked how all the level script comments behave and the main level scripts and I am going to Do like area processing next? You'll make a power version of this mod you Did I not tell you you have to make the power version, please don't tell me you forgot I Saving me, buddy It's the cool Yoshi I miss something Like blue cyan on our mind Maybe audio processing shadow flower. Oh Oh Yeah, they're the maraca beach crabs they are like a really old import there's There's a not 100% chance that they stay I Get much rather have them be 3d models to pinch you I Think that'd be much more in style Okay, we have a problem the Yoshi's don't move look at them dumb asses So Today we're working on decorating the overworld to we want the Yoshi's to move around more to Have the entire world be feeling alive. The thing is there's 10 special Yoshi's. So this is this is something we need to think about There's 10 special Yoshi's then give you missions That's the current idea. These missions are like the comments in Mario Galaxy how do we make sure the player knows that it's these 10 Yoshi's that give you missions or Is this a terrible idea to begin with and maybe not these 10 Yoshi's should give you missions But like every Yoshi should give you one mission or something like that Make them sparkle. Well, they have Maybe you saw this You see the exclamation mark here, that's what they have right now And then when you're in the level the Yoshi is supposed to appear here, but he doesn't have a floating render here which makes perfect sense That's supposed to have a shadow Will there be gay Luigi In this version no, but in the PAL part that you will have to work on possibly This is how it looks and see how the Yoshi is like doing this I did not think this mission would still work. We need a much better HUD for this though Mission failed So I haven't worked on it this week because I was working on making sure the first five levels work and I'm ready for a beta test But Yeah, do we actually want every single Yoshi to give you a mission instead maybe Although that would make the repeat missions less obvious I think it's close to maybe it's over five years. I Don't know It's going pretty well Solomon We are right now working on decorating the overworld, but I'm thinking about maybe we need to change something about the Yoshi missions Let me reiterate the idea here So there's 11 different Yoshi's that are special these 11 Yoshi's if you Make a certain amount of progress in the game the Yoshi's have an exclamation mark above their head in the overworld and If you talk to them, they give you a mission this mission brings you into one of the 15 courses where Yoshi appears on the app select and he like waves at you and If you do the mission That that he's told you to do you get an extra star. It's just like green comments The One issue I see with this is that How are you gonna know that these 11 Yoshi's are special Would this not lead players to believe that other Yoshi's on the other are also gonna have missions When I refer to special Yoshi's when they give you missions That would be the easiest idea. We could have only be Only the first overworld Yoshi's that give you special missions No, I like the mechanic I'm just thinking about all the possible confusions this could lead to So we're development done The programming for everything in the first part of the overworld is done and now we're decorating it up Because I want to run a beta test. So when I get this to like 100% When you make the net search on my screen as late as possible because we haven't finalized the UI This is a free romhack no You know how hungry lumas look very different from regular lumas yes Yes, this is a good example these guys look very different so that makes it immediately obvious The Way to get the special Yoshi's yes after you beat the first Bowser level the special Yoshi's start spawning Because before that they are captured by Bowser Yes, ma'am I Am a little worried that if I put all the special Yoshi's right here in the first overworld That later overworld parts are going to feel a little less special I know I feel like Many will be overlooked if you're she get for Chris one gets a task of the resource No one will notice the normal player will come back to part one. I'll be back. So stick with you. She got a task Yes, yes, you're not supposed to come back every like every star There's going to be like a map screen that tells you if there's something to do somewhere, you know, how our galaxy does it? Give them special drip. I agree with that. I think that might be the play We could give each Yoshi like a special piece of drip Let's see, okay, what would the green Yoshi have? So, okay If you give every single one of those Yoshi's like a special thing That makes them stand out and all the other Yoshi's on the island are naked That will work out that will make it very clear which Yoshi's are worth interacting with and which ones aren't I think that is the play This is the Yoshi model, okay, so this one needs like a sleeping mask Hmm This one maybe Long eyelash, that's the formal green one the polite one. What for the polite one is like the real Yoshi You know, that's the one you went on an adventure with They give you star Samuel Dark blue one. No, there's there's Boshi is actually in the game. There's an actual Boshi in the game He has a completely different model he looks a lot edgier Maybe some formula thing from our franchise. No, I want them based on personality so that we can make their personality part of The thing maybe like an explorer heads Because okay, this is also a thing. I didn't mention they all have special missions So for the green one, we are thinking you find stars in very hidden spots. They're like green stars on Mario Galaxy The black one would ask you to get a star without touching a coin The blue one would give you a potion that changes your physics in some way that completely changes the star The sign loses its teddy in a level. I don't like that. That's a shitty one The orange one asked you to do something in less than some amount of a presses, which I think that's a very cool one The pink one says her boyfriend is in level go find him He talks to you and then runs and you have to catch him. This is also a shitty one different one You it's like a point collecting mission from our galaxy The red one is like a kill machine kill a bunch of things The white one gives you a riddle The yellow one is a time mission and the brown one is the one on a coin star So that's what the missions are gonna yes exactly Solomon that's that's that's why I'm mentioning this Yeah, but there's still two terrible ones Playing convention knuckles emerald type thing we can't do that worthy of Yoshi coins And mini Mario, which also could just be a potion from the Yoshi And to me like a remnant but feel very badly I Don't eat that you mean to give them like bunny ears You Guys please stop talking about release dance. We're trying to make the game. I do not want to engage in this topic of conversation So if the green one is about finding a secret star, I think an Explorer has good The black one asked you to get a star without touching a coin because money is not everything in life, dude I Don't want Mario skins right now not a priority Oswald what's Oswald? This looks ill These are all great Maybe for a unique egg in their hands. Oh, we're going with the drip, I think Each Yoshi will have exactly three stars And we don't need to come up with all of these right now The brown one, of course, he has sunglasses Cool one. He needs sunglasses Especially must be baby. Yoshi's to grow adult upon completing their mission On one end yes on the other hand I want them to unlock as soon as you beat the first Bowser level and I don't think we want small children being abducted by Mouser With a rock on a beach somewhere we have a rock on the beach I Still like a scientist hat we can give someone What's a scientist hat? What does a scientist look like? What if we give them Albert Einstein here? There are no rabbits in the game except for the one level No, they're gonna be a few different courses for Yoshi tea time I'm not adding the rabbits now Dr. Ein, let me see that Oh, this just looks like Einstein now We can also change the personalities of the Yoshi's especially because some missions suck like This one's fine. This one's fine. This one sucks That's fine this one sucks Yeah, they're all fine except for those two Finding the new mayor and you know, which would be the sassy Yoshi and the crybaby Yoshi Just runs the seven deadly sins Well, a lot of them are like that, right? There's the anger Yoshi. There's the lazy Yoshi Big round glasses, you know what? That's a great idea All right, what about the wise Yoshi half just a headband Maybe this is better. Maybe the red Yoshi should have like a karate band Not like this And that's what I was thinking I Mean I've seen this here in the middle of the ocean. No Greeny and button you know, she sounds fun. That is true. I don't think we have a gluttony Yoshi What would the gluttony Yoshi mission be? Could it easily replace the cyan or pink one with that? Although crybaby is really funny You Giving the crybaby Yoshi a pacifier would be hilarious Mustache you know what fine mustache. I like that like a Yoshi stash Surely that exists You like fetch quests What is a fetch quest if you think about it all of Mario 64 is a fetch quest, right I Think the son of pride would be kind of cool, but weird having a mission where a person that is selfish Wait pride is being selfish I can't as you don't explain your audio. Well, it doesn't work because you can't carry stuff out of courses It needs to be entirely in the course ideally with these missions is These missions are things that would people would give themselves as Challengers so maybe and what about the cyan one? He's a crybaby. He doesn't like take damage What if he plays under that you have to find a star damage less? Yeah, and he's like fragile How would a fragile person look like what would they wear a Hamburger for the fat Yoshi, no, that's lame. That's a terrible mission. No one would like doing that I Said friend is love yourself and basically said you and everything what yeah That's meant to know it has to be headgear What if it was wearing an eggshaw Because he's a big he's a baby. Of course. He's fragile. That's why he's wearing an eggshell, but also he's a baby So he's still wearing his eggshell That's awesome. I like that To Carry an active checkpoint that is lame as hell Construction helmets. Well, that's kind of the opposite of fresher We still okay we need one more replacement mission and that is this boyfriend one unless we can somehow think of a better way to do it Calimero, what's that? Oh That's funny I didn't know this existed This is Calimero it's a bird with half an egg. Yeah, that's basically what he is The Fighting Yoshi and paper Mario 64 is this a banger dude that guy is not a crybaby Hmm My boyfriend is hidden and you have to find them. You know what? I feel like the girlies are not gonna like this one I can't just make the pink one the girl Yoshi. That's like a bitch. That sucks I was thinking that would be a sassy Yoshi If he'd almost lost his shoes that's no not a good mission Now here's an eggshell. Eggshell is a good one I like eggshell a lot What are other challenges people do in Mario 64 capless Coinless Imageless where do you have that? The Drunk Yoshi that fucks up Mario's control. The drunk driving Yoshi And the cheerful fast one can wear Feathers like Mario's spin cap. Wait a second What if One of the Yoshi's gave you like a power-up at the start of the level but added some other thing that makes the level more difficult The wing cap is fun as hell. We should use the wing cap more We could do that with the pink one Pink one gives you a mission where you start with the wing cap Wing cap but the floor is lava. How do you define what the floor is though? That's the problem Look at a random level and think about what the floor would be The Idea is great. Don't get me wrong. It's just what here would be the floor that I spawn on the floor What if you spawned in with the wing cap and Mario immediately started flying and you had to touch the star without ever touching the floor Which star would actually be collectible though Like yeah, I could collect that star with enough speed but then if I get bored of my speed that's a boring star The idea sounds enticing but I cannot think of a single way to do it that doesn't suck Even in this level here and there is like It's no place to go Yeah, I don't think that works it's a cool idea but we need we need a different idea I think the wing cap is to play The floor is lava and rain is just These missions don't have a dedicated star They have a dedicated. Well, I guess we could add a star anywhere in the level if we really wanted It just needs to be communicated clearly to the player it's the problem I could be raising notes or something. There is a time challenge already What can we do with the wing cap Maybe the wing cap is not the play after all I Guess we required a boss battle challenge like a harder boss battle. Oh, we already have one Yoshi requires damageless, right? Oh This is where to put the last Yoshi Over some cannons And it's could be fun It could just be placed on if I make a model for it Someone we need to make three stars in the existing levels and Most of the time I want to reuse an existing star just make it the player get it again But that time was like an extra challenge That's a lot of work dark ways changing all the boss battles like that, I don't want to have to deal with maintaining a system like that I Don't set a blue Yoshi, which you know gives you a physics change That makes the level a lot harder. It's the idea So that one we can get creative Do We even want the ocean to be sassy maybe you think of a new personality for the Yoshi first you can think of that What are the seven deadly sins? What are those? Please don't show me this pedophile enemy, please. Please. No. No, it's choking the pedophile enemy Over here a second image Blast okay, we cannot put last in here gluttony we could put that right Yeah, sloth. Where do you have that breath? Where do you have that greed? We have that envy? Hmm Envy or gluttony would work Captain totes that challenge you mean like no jumps already have the a button challenge Whoa Oh Did that happen That was trippy And we are she would be just okay, but then what would the mission be But do we really want to envious Yoshi like a gluttonous Yoshi is kind of funny and envious Yoshi is just an asshole You can be friends for the glutton You can't be friends with an envious person So Maybe envy is not the personal trait he wants Actually, why is gluttony the deadly sin what's so bad about gluttony that's like your personal issue wrong Are you treating this like it's going to ruin societal cohesion All that happens is you get fat I Scared we have a crybaby Yoshi. We could also have a scared one Yep, exactly makeup, that's why we're not doing that I So one Yoshi that's like scary missions There is lots of scary places in this game so that wouldn't be so bad. How would you make a scary mission now? Like in practice, what would a scary mission look like There's Like 200 small changes at this point. I'll see stuff that just makes everything work smoother Like you see how when I do this and then I turn around tomorrow turns around he doesn't do this That's a change Skimming a cosmetic Mario mission it does not Mario mission it does not No arguing any enemies now, that would be something I have to implement into every enemy individually, that's like a check Now we don't have a cosmic Mario I Don't think that would be necessarily a good idea at all. I don't think cosmic Mario is very interesting I Yeah, that needs to be specially implemented by each level also not really double calf courts Hidden invisible booze that doesn't sound fun The cadets to say fuck it there's only nine or only ten Yoshi missions And then you get four stars from each for a total of four T stars Instead of 44, maybe that's the play, you know, just say fuck it shit Friction Friction didn't work in Mario 64. So I fixed it and now it broke a bunch of things because a bunch of things just have a wrong friction side That's what happens when you fix engine bugs everything changes Do you think a race to the finish of a thousand eight? I've been seeing people blend up one market when you have to race to the top of my book rising water We have a race to the finish. I Think the players to just Kill it Fuck it. This Yoshi is gone Brown Yoshi moves to its place I Think it's gone Will there be stars in this game? Yes, like 200 of them Although as it looks like right now 40 of them is going to be Yoshi stars What is all this stuff, why do they all have special code like this? Ah The point of this I Everyone but for right now should be unified I Think I like this better now, we got rid of two bad missions. We added one good mission The OCS are still not walking as intended which is a problem. Let's see why that happens I Know that sounds too jank one. Well, I don't think it would be very fun. So I'm not sure if he's working on right now It's a little bit concerning I'm gonna be honest Now I see it's a project 64 issue This is why the oceans weren't working I Think I mean that was definitely an issue Interesting I Didn't find freebie I said a to a to freebie 64. That's the address Three as in the number of the two You're trolling me Think I'm being trolled You know, I think you're right a time then there's a good chance that that's gonna happen I Was going to line up in a final release Now we're thinking of making the entire game good and then the lighthouse is just completely fucked up You know just like to add a little spice, you know, I like cook sometimes epic bitter spices to their food. It's kind of like that Oh Now the Yoshi's walk Until they eventually get stuck interesting so they walk first and I get stuck Ah They also seem to have trouble walking I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I What happened here? This is a bug report for Leela. What the fuck did it do to my file? I don't think it likes that there's comments in here. Could that be? Nope. It just completely destroys my file. I don't know why FastX64 just completely destroys the file when you export an animation. That is a little bit crazy. Resayna did not install Linux, no. At least not to my knowledge. Why didn't it move my Yoshi into the ground? I guess I have to re-export all animations. What the fuck? Looks like the animations are looping wrong. Or not at all even. Like the Yoshis are beginning to warp. Yeah. Okay. I need to set the minimum animation frame, the frame they start walking, to like 75. Now they slide out. They're mopping up what's like that is known because I have to re-export the animation. That looked kind of fine. But now he froze. The animation is not set to loop. That's why. And I have to re-export it again. Oh wait, for a second I thought all my animations just suddenly were gone. Wait, they are gone! Where are my animations? Wait what? Oh my god. I can't undo. And a numerator. No it's just a bug from the fast and stupid animation rework. I'm sure it will get fixed. Yeah. Right now what happens is, yeah like that. In the end they do a little bit of walking on the spot which is pretty ugly. But it's looking closer to what we want. So the reason they're walking on the spot is, oh god wait. How many loops of walking is this? Why is this so many loops of walking? How can I make this clean? I don't want to add like two more animations for fade in and fade out. We got that. And then, why don't we just go from here to here with 35. Yeah, I think that would work. Yeah, I see that Zeyna. But there were like two loops of walking in there. Which made it so that when they transitioned they would like slide across the floor for a bit. What did I do now? Oh my god. So many bugs in the tooling. I think I have to just make clean and then we'll fix that stuff. I'm sure this will fix the Yoshi. This is I think because of Arthur Strohl. Arthur Strohl converts the animations from Euler to Quaternion. Problem seems to be that it doesn't always do that before building the file that goes into the ROM. So sometimes we just build the file with Euler angles. And then it looks like that. Hey, it works. Quaternion is in three sentences. I mean that's very easy depending on how long of a sentence you can make and how complex of an explanation you need for the Quaternions. What I said just now was only one sentence. Looks pretty nice now. I think that works pretty well. That was a weird jump. Yeah, you think that looks weird with my moon jump? You don't think the moon jump should be in the final game? No way. I think a bunch of these animations are missing. Is that like intended? Like are they just not done? I don't actually remember whether they were done or not. Really? What the fuck? Neat. Neat. Neat. Steam audio keeps cutting out. Am I talking too quiet? Oops. Yeah, Arthur, it sometimes does that. You see this? Your tool like converts the animations after the .o file is built. It's over for you too. I need to make clean when that happens. It's just reading garbage now. Not sure why that would happen. It's not added correctly as a dependency in Makefile. I can probably just ask MechaHitler how to fix that. Remember how many animations we had for Yoshis? Like 10 so far? Well, this is a Yoshi animation, not a Maori animation. You didn't find Maori's color? No, it's not on the behavior bank manager. It's at A23B64. Just open the hex editor. HXD. Is there a romhack? I don't have one romhack on my entire drive. Please. Just one. .z64? I do not have a romhack. I cannot show you how to do it. Maybe in my downloads folder? Standard ROM CASA. Right here, that's where Maori's color is. 0007F That's his overalls. Right here. 2828, that's the lighting direction. 7F00, that's his cap. How do you not see it? Gloves are here. And this is his shoes. This is... ... Something yellow-ish. His skin! And this also looks like his shoes. Maybe that's his hair. So obvious. It is possible, I'm not sure I like it. Wait, pants wrote something and I missed it. Oh, he gave you a definitional quaternion. Nobody does that, you just saw it live. I don't know. I told you to open a hacks editor. How are you going to ROM manager and look at A23B64? I told you to use a hacks editor. I mean, I guess there's maybe a hacks editor in ROM manager, but... That fully characterizes quaternions up to isomorphism. Wait. Let me read that again. Really? So quaternions can be any dimension? Or is it just the only associative non-cumulative divisional algebra possible is four-dimensional? Is that it? This is basically like a riddle. The latter. Define what a human is. Something that has four legs in the morning and two legs in the noon and three legs in the evening. You get what I mean? I hate that riddle. It is the worst riddle. Which one's the brown one? Which one's the brown one? 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There we go. This is no longer the case. This is no longer the case. I believe you, but obviously like it's a ridiculous way to define it. It's fair enough, right? If you can prove that that's the only thing that describes quaternions, then yeah, why not? Well, the riddles. No. Fuck the Sphinx. If I got killed for getting that riddle wrong, I'd be so mad. I'd be in the afterlife being like dude, that's not how time works, bro. People don't age in one day. Anyway, time to disperse more Yoshis over the overworld. We have all up to the brown one. So, where do we put these guys? I think I want the red one here. The red one's pissed. I think it'd be very fitting for the Bowser statue to like imply that he destroyed the Bowser statue. Where did it go? The brown one is cool. He's wearing sunglasses. I feel like the brown one would be in the third part of the overworld then. The purple one is fabulous. He also would be in the third part, I think. The white one is absent-minded and introverted. He feels like someone that would hang out somewhere alone. Maybe around here. Then we have a cheerful one. He also feels like he would be in the last part of the overworld. So, just two in here. That's fine. There we go. Let's put the fabulous one here. The cheerful one here. And the cool guy. Where would the cool guy hang out? Maybe on the island. Dude, there's actually one textbox in RTYI that like now that everyone's talking about Epstein Island is like terrible. There's just like one Koopa that's like what was I doing on the island? Big Koopa secret. You just see this guy and you think what the fuck is this alluding to? I don't know. See, the thing is there's an island in the level that you cannot reach on the first two stars and on the third star he is no longer on the island but on the first two you can just see him and theorize what he's doing up there. So when you then finally see him it makes sense in that context. But out of context it just sounds like an Epstein Island joke. Which this game is not intending to do. Guys, what has two legs in the morning one leg in the afternoon and then two legs in the evening? This is annoying. This riddle is just as good as the Sphinx one. This guy is mauling. I also just noticed that lizard? Good guess but wrong. I know the answer, it's a cotter onion. Also wrong. This level still feels super empty. We need like tons of little grasshoppers and animals. He calls you Da Linky? What the Varia doing? He's ripping you off, dude. 1000 coins, 4 star. Hello, excellent gamer. I think my biggest problem with this is the density of the earlier area here. It feels a little bit Hyrule-fieldy. Maybe we should shrink the whole area a little bit. Make it less big and open. I think that might be the only correct play here. What about area 2? Is that one too big? This jump feels too big to do for something so early. Like I fear this will happen. That needs to be lower. Okay, we need to shrink part of the overworld a little bit. Right now, I don't think this would be very fun to deal with. Okay. Well, there's a little bit of a problem with how much we can shrink it before the entire world falls apart. Shit. Let me just back this up on GitHub. Just so I'm safe. No matter what I do, I don't want to completely ruin my file here. That was a decal issue. There really isn't much we can do about that on the N64. It is also a little weird on emulator. That might not actually happen on the real N64. Okay. Oops. 500 Someone remember 500? Another 500. Now we're at 1000. Okay. 1500 Is that enough? 1500 Definitely a lot less bad now. Let's go with 15 first. Check out how it looks. Okay. Okay. What the hell? Unselect us please. There we go. We need to reconnect the tunnel here. This is why we didn't finish the overworld right away and why so much of the overworld still looks rough. Cause stuff like this happens. Hello smudge. Hello Lord Indiata Jaeger.

Obviously the UV map here is not completely fucked. But it just needs to look good enough for the first try test. I think this works. There's still quite a bit of a long stretch of nothing, but I think it needs to be there for the transition to look fine. Otherwise the loading transition is going to be too obvious. So that sucks. The general sense of scale, but more consensed. Yeah. It makes it feel more lived in too. Let's put down a bunch of grasshoppers here. All right, let's get a new idea of what this level feels like right now. Let's get it without the Yoshi guys, because that's what we're actually going to be looking at. Is the skybridge transition going to change with release? Yes. So in the final version, the way this is going to work is that there is not going to be any warps anymore. It is going to be seamless. So every area is going to have to render every area next to it, which means we have to do some special model stuff. But of course, we don't want to do that yet, because if we do it now, then we're going to have to do that work over and over. Maybe a few many grasshoppers here. Yeah, I'm going to remove two of them. That's too much. Oh good, only two grasshoppers, more than that is overkill. I also like how it makes this island here feel much off to the side now, compared to before, when it was almost part of the main island. And it's giving this a very unique shape, which is good. Wow, a platform. And of course, this needs to render the actual cave here. So it doesn't look like we fucked the cave up too much here, which is good. Yeah the textures are temporary. This is still version one of the overworld, which is before Biobank actually makes it pretty. Everything you see here right now is just me putting in version one to communicate the idea to the guy that will actually make the model in the end. Any new videos coming soon? I'm making a video about the sound engine, that one's really scripted, I just need to record all the footage and stuff. And then after that, maybe one about the exclamation boxes, I don't know. If you have an idea for a video you want to see, I can make it about that maybe. But I kind of do not like making videos, like gathering all the footage is bad. The scripting I don't mind, but gathering the footage, holy shit I hate it. YouTubers, when you ask them to do their job, noooo. This is kind of pointless and we can remove it actually, this whole part here. And just going forward, it doesn't hide the transition even, fuck it, it's going to be I finished programming everything for the first part of the overworld. And now I want to decorate the first part of the overworld and make sure the first five courses work fine, which I have been on the progress of. I made sure course one and two and three work fine. Four and five are still missing and the puzzle level is still missing. And then once that is done, we can finally get the test done for the first overworld. You done decorating anything? Uh, so far we've only added really the Yoshis and a bunch of grasshoppers. And we've made the overworld parts a little more cozy. Nothing too much. I haven't like added flowers or anything like that yet. I think we're probably going to have one more decorating stream or two. To be honest, I am done for now. The footage needs to look more colorful, blends in too much with the rest of the island, doesn't look sweet enough. You are absolutely correct. If you have ideas on how to improve it, I am absolutely up for it. But for now, I think I'm going offline. So, I'll see you guys next stream. Bye bye!
