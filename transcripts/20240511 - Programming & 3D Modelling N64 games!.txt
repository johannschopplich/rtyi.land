Hello, hello. Anybody here? Hello, Grave. Hello, Blinks. Zeyna, you are not first. You are second, actually. Very unfortunate. I remember there was a time when you were first all the time. Yeah. B? D. You want true. Another sub? Hello, Sonic the Hedgehog. Thank you for the sub. Welcome to being here, Poggers. So, I have been talking to Biobak about how... Hello, Jinxy. No freaking way. That's a long time. Welcome to the stream. As I was saying, I was working with Biobak off-stream to try and find an art style for this. We were working very actively. But he had some neat ideas and I had some neat ideas. And I think... I think this is a decent art style for this level here. I just have an enemy first. I see Kaze, I'm like, no. What? Who do you collect the stream for if not for me? It looks really bad. Awesome. I do like this, though. I think you might just be wrong, CXLinks. What OST do we pick today? It will be... Switch OST. Kirby and the Forgotten Land. B3313? We're not missing the B3313 OST. Did I say the interactions I made? I don't think so. Beavis and Butt-head for Genesis. You know what? I feel like we should play more stupid movie games. Like, we collectively as humanity. Hello, KakiDefFur. So, I don't think I like this concept here. What are you doing right now? We are still planning the level. Now that we have an art style that kind of works, which is this here. Hello, Halion. You got a Basquiat. Not on purpose. My wife just kind of fucked up my hair. And now I look like this. Confirmed, will you be making a kart racing engine? Very. Like, 100%. Maybe 95%. What's the level about? It's an ice castle. We're gonna go bald? Well, I almost did go bald, because my haircut was that bad. We had to cut it down, so it can regrow better. So, I was planning rooms in this castle. I was planning the general layout, and I was planning the stars. So far, I actually only have five stars, but we have a few more ideas. So, once more people are here, I'm gonna start presenting some of the ideas. The idea here is, it's kind of like an eerie ice castle. It's gonna be like this.    Kind of a lonely world for Mario, with a lot of enemies. Some more hardcore platforming. So, this is more like, you know, this is the late end of the game. I want you to think about levels like Tick Tock Clock, when you think about this here. In terms of how the vibe is. Crystal cave. What are you talking about? Oh, and they just called it Crystal Cave? That is the least creative level name of all time. I know at least three levels named Crystal Caves now. Star Wars CDC? No, of course not. No, just Tick Tock Clock in terms of the vibe. Why is it? Anyone else see this at 30 FPS? Am I fucking insane? Nice, nice, nice. In case, can we make a truce? Sure. I was thinking about a few good card racing races on PC. I was also thinking a goal would be to release a PC and N64 at the same time. Yes, if you make a game that releases on both N64 and PC at the same time, that's some insane advertising. Now it's 60. I think the unlimited FPS option is just wrong. Oh. Okay, never mind. Makes sense. I know what happened, don't worry about it. Instead of a newer market, I mean like Xen, because Xen is annoying to use. Yeah, I think so too. Dual release on two consoles on PC and N64 at the same time is perfectly possible. And Ares never used it, but it also seems annoying to use. Why not just 1.6? Take this for example, the bottom of this. You think this here? Well, I was planning on something where it would get like half cleared. You know, like the area like behind the crystal here. How it's like kind of looking washed out. Something like that is what I want in one area. Okay, what's the idea? Kayan. Because that could be cool. Probably this could result in me going nuts. It's fun, but wow, there's some parts of it bad. TDM, just clean up. Uh-huh. Yeah, either way. Let me present to you what we have for this level so far. So we need six stars. The 8-bit pipe, kind of unfitting. But this is like the best 8-bit game that is still left to assign and that is Mario Land 1. I'm thinking outside the castle is gonna be the red coins. I'm not 100% sure about this yet. Alternatively, the red coins could be in a castle courtyard, like inside the castle. Maybe. Maybe the courtyard should also just not be part of the castle. Like, maybe it should just be like, it's the castle courtyard. Maybe that works better, actually. Like so. Actually, my second emulator of choice, if not Project 64, would be the new NEMU64. Because the new NEMU64 is actually really nice. It's the most accurate emulator I have used so far. It is more accurate than Parallel, for sure. Parallel Launcher, that is. Not Parallel RDP. I mean, it uses Parallel RDP. But the CPU is more accurate than that, so. Ares still wins? I don't know. And neither do you. You've never used NEMU. NEMU accurately emulates Cache, actually. Does Ares do that, too? How accurate is Ares here? Oh, this thing? Oh, okay. Well, NEMU isn't publicly released yet. I'm just having a beta testing build. Final Red Prime is just a B3v1 free? No! No, you can't install NEMU yet. It's not released. Yes, the Raven is the boss. Because it's not released yet, and I don't think it's going to release anytime soon. The guy making it is just doing this as a hobby thing. I don't think it's going to release anytime soon. I'm just testing it for him, and I like using it. You don't get to walk around? But one could look at the outside of little areas like the garden amusement. Well, you can be outside here, actually. So I'm thinking you can look at it. It's just there isn't much here. Hello, Biobak. Either way, Starfar. So I wanted cold haze rooms. I'm thinking there's going to be a basement to the castle. And the basement of the castle is going to be ice cold. Like, damage over time ice cold. And there's going to be like haze. Like fog, because it's so cold. And in some places, there's going to be fire. And the fire like melts the ice around it, and there's no haze there. And you can go to the fire as like a safe spot. And then you just kind of have to like dash to the next fire. I think that's a very cool concept. Hello, Valzer. Starfree, obviously the boss fight with the Raven. So I'm thinking we have a U-shaped castle like this. And you enter through the main entrance. And then you can keep going into the castle through many different paths. It's kind of like a labyrinth in a way. But it's not like a labyrinth in the way that every path is going to move you forward. Right? And they're going to be branching into each other. But as soon as they start branching into each other, you're like on the final path to a star. Does that make sense? So it's going to feel confusing, but not frustrating is the goal here. Star 2, platforming onto a star you see early on, but can't reach until later. And I want you to think of the Big Boo's Haunt puzzle of the library. So what this means is we would have the foyer room. There would be castles, stairs that go up. But the stairs are super slippery, so you can't actually walk up. And then maybe above at the foyer, at the very top, there's going to be a staircase. And you have no idea how to get to it. But then you walk through the castle and you get to the star. Yeah, I do that plenty of times. Actually, just turn off the Z-Buffer entirely. Okay. Does making big objects and levels... Yeah, okay, wait, I already read that. You can turn it off? Yeah, you can turn it off. Basically makes it render without setting a depth. And also makes it infinitely close to the camera, but also infinitely far away. Does that make sense? And yeah, we're still missing one star here. But I have plenty of rooms, and I think any of the rooms could work to just be a star. So one idea would be a hex room kind of thing. So you see how there's this room that's like hexagonal. This room doesn't look very good yet. But I was thinking rooms like this that you have to gauntlet through. And maybe that would be a bit more maze-like. And let me just show you what they are made for, the bricks. Consists of the castle's kitchen, with the hot pot possibly being the kitchen itself. It's... It's not quite the vibe I want. I wanted more ominous, not like funky. Why do we cancel for gargoyle jokes? Come on. Yeah, so Zena made an icy bricks combiner. Looks pretty good here. Although it's not as icy as we'd like it. There's a different idea I had. And that would be, we have exactly six valid configurations for walls. And each direction of wall has an associated normal map. And I'm thinking there's gonna be a normal map and a brightness map. And we're gonna multiply the camera direction with the normal map. And then multiply that with the reflection map to generate a texture on the CPU. And that is what we render. So that way you would get reflections on the sides of the cubes. So it would actually look like ice cubes, I hope. But it has a limitation, like it's expensive and we can only do six walls at the same time. Unless we program every direction individually. No, it's not like a parallax effect at all. It's a CPU-generated normal map. You know what a normal map is? Is this then what I want? Yeah, you see how this makes it look like there's like actual depth here even though there isn't? That's the idea. It's like the way the shadows reflect off the thing. Yeah, basically it just lets you paint details like this. And we can do that on the N64 as I described. Did we just get another sub? Thank you for the sub, B-Turk. But we would need to generate the normal map somehow. It's somewhat like a poor man's big lighting. Kinda, maybe? I guess with the fact that the light doesn't move, yes. But yeah, this is likely what we use for the majority of the rooms. Can you generate lighting from the outside? That's an incomprehensible sentence to me. Like some of the generators are like as if it's from outside. Like imagine the sun at the angle. You can bake that, yes. You can do a nth map, but not 128x128. Okay, let me present the room ideas we have. Or the whole idea, if you guys can tell me what you think. Or if you have a better idea. So color palette gonna be dark blue, light blue and white. You know, kinda like what we have here. Maybe like a bit deeper blue. NPCs. Okay, there's houses outside with penguins inside. You can actually see the penguins and they're all like go away. We're scared of the monster. I'm thinking of ice block enemies. The block being the nappy net from Yoshi's Island. So like the big guy that comes out of the water goes, whoa. The ice demons is. Let's flame it. See how they're called. Crazy, maybe. You know what? They don't exist. I made them up, but they exist. Don't worry about it. And the big snowman enemy. Who basically rolls his head at you. So he would be like at the top of a staircase or something like that. And we're gonna use the ravens from Yoshi's Island. One platforming mechanic I'm thinking of was an ice wave generator. So imagine it generates ice waves shaped like this. That go towards you. And you're gonna have to jump onto the back of it. Slide and then jump onto the next one. Basically. I think that would be very cool. We're not putting a Pokemon into this level. Wind gusts through the castle. I think that has potential. A spinning ice shot. Okay, I'm thinking for here. I'm thinking like a hexagonal ice piece. And it rotates. And you can jump onto it. And Mario will slide down it. But then it rotates. And it redirects your wall jump. An appearing path. You know the Mario Galaxy thing. Where the path appears when you get closer to it. We can do that. Scroll S slow on the ice wall. That's when my PC is too old to record videos. Alright, let me see. It crashed. Did you update blender again? Maybe if I use a newer blender where it works. Yes, there is an idea for a cracking ice block. Like an ice block that you jump on the first time it cracks. The second time you jump it just breaks. Thanks for watching! Oh wait, I didn't mean to do that, no. How do I undo everything I just did? I'm just gonna re-open the file, whoops, okay, there we go. I see, I see, yes, that is extremely cool. Oh wait, and this doesn't do anything I imagined, here, it's a 128x16 texture, that's an interesting aspect ratio. I think you can make this 128x1, you can scroll down based on camera angle for a cool reflection effect. Yeah, yeah, that would be really cool. I do like this idea. Snoping runes from Twilight Princess, that is actually one of the inspirations for the This has to be RGBA, but yeah. Oh, I see what you're doing, interesting, interesting idea. The normal idea sounded so cool though, yeah, but it is very limiting. I like this too. It looks shiny, yeah, especially it's gonna be shiny because this is gonna move depending on your camera angle. I'm actually thinking it should probably be bigger, like so. We can use both, right? We can have the spikes in some places and then the actual brick walls like in other places. I think it would look very cool. Someone drew and said it's better for console and me. I think we should use a mix of both. I see what you mean. I wish I could just take this thing and import it into my current blender version, but that doesn't work, cool. You wouldn't happen to have an old blender version of that, would you? We are gonna have places with more reflection, the limitation with that is that for a proper reflection we kinda need the whole thing to be somewhat even. Maybe not actually if the collision map, if we just use that, but eh. The music is supposed to be like in the SM64 version, but I can see why you would want one-to-one. Yeah, but imagine rendering like 200 marios like that, it's not gonna go well. I'm just gonna export the texture from here and recreate the material. It should be easy enough. The scale issue, sorry Leena that I can't render 200 marios on my N64. It would be a shame how deep I've fallen. How viable is screen-space-reflection on my yet-rendered targets on N64? Rendered targets are very viable. Not that I want to deal with them, but I mean even Mario Kart 64 had them. Mario Sunshine has reflections? Oh, this is your material? That's crazy. Oh, but this, this, okay, well, I see, I see, I see. ParenCon was gonna open the door in 30 minutes, what? Yo, thank you for the sub, Alep, yes. Yeah, I see what you did. Thank you for the sub, Vici. Damn, we're getting so many subs today, what's going on? Wait, did someone donate a bunch of subs? I don't have Twitch chat open, I use Restream chat. Who donated subs and how many? Oh my god. There must have been a shit ton. Who do I need to thank? StrangeSalad5150? You're not kidding about ParenCon opening the door? You think he found where I live?  Let's see, multiply this by primitive color and add texture 1, that makes sense to me. Then texture 1, okay, so this is just a lerp. What other values do you have here? Primitive color is set to near gray. CrapStorageK5, alright, thank you very much, CrapStorage. There we go. Oh, the shine is also way too big, I see. I'm gonna just get it done. What do you mean case of WTF? Why are you WTFing me for? This looks weird. Why? What about this is weird? You want the color of this closer to white? I kinda do. It took me a while behind those crystals, because it looks cool. The crystals just grew on it, you know? Why are you so sad? Maybe something in the freezer too long and there's ice all over it? Exactly, exactly, Biopack gets it. Okay. Yeah, I need to add a new texture anim to this. I'm also gonna move the spawn point here, because the first room is officially poopy. Did I tell you guys that I wrote a new OS for my N64? It's all done now, it's all good. I'm still gonna optimize parts of it, but it's already quite a bit better. And it gives me a lot more control. We're gonna find a lot of optimizations with the new OS. Isn't that neat? Yeah, it's basically just a rewrite of Libultra. Or an update rather. Thank you for the sub, GN Gaming. I kinda just took Libultra and ripped out only the parts I needed. And now I'm putting back the parts in a way that hopefully is a lot better. Right. Yeah, so fun fact, you can actually make this type of texture. Dude, I'm so excited to see the oil level sub areas. I believe him when he says it's gonna go hard. I wonder if we can do this brick here better. Like as a 64x64 IA4 or 64x32 IA8. It's just a randomized brick texture, I don't know. Gotcha. Makes perfect sense to me. Okay. How did she get an alpha layer into a bitmap? Wait. Wait, wait, wait, huh? What? I don't have a choice for the esec room? Alright. As long as it's somewhat consistent with the rest of the game, I'm 100% up for that. As long as you don't put a shoutouts to simpleflips type room, you know what I mean? We're not doing that fanboy type shit. I know you wouldn't do that. I'm just saying that to make fun of someone else I worked with. You're gonna love the joke, I think. Alright. Can we detect the black and white and gradient alpha layer from using photo filter? Hmm. The thing is, I didn't even know these could have alpha layers. And when I opened it in Photoshop, there is no alpha layer here. What does GIMP say? BlenderSOMO sees the alpha layer. Yeah. Yeah, GIMP doesn't see it either.  Either way, let's find a good brick texture here. Transparency. Yeah. They said we're going to play around with the contrast to make the color textures look good. What? Oh, you're talking about bio. I see. Yeah. I might have a snowy brick in here. Saying that it created the alpha layer? No, but it's already in the image. It's just that no program actually sees it, except for Blender for some reason. Oh, Zena's making the raven. That looks pretty nice. I like this.  Today, just make sure you open the right one. Yeah, I opened the ice test one. The other one is the Mario Party one. And this one doesn't have it either. Bitmap alpha pixels might just be like a Windows 11 feature. I don't know. I always thought bitmaps have no alpha. Can you give him a Santa hat? No, no, no, we don't want that. Maybe the big boss actually, but I don't know. Would it be a funny concept if they were all afraid of just Santa Claus? Can BMPs have palettes? They shouldn't be. I'm seeing them in ASprite. Yeah, I'm sure some programs can do it. It's just that no program I own except for Blender can do it. Right, even GIMP couldn't. Like, it's just not here. Same with this one. We should play the game on Christmas. You know that's possible, right? But we would have to make people enter the current date. Game count what? Display alpha channels on bitmap textures. Oh, you just send it to me as a PNG. Hey, it's here. I'm thinking I'm just going to copy the alpha channel here. How do I get the alpha channel from this? Literally, how is there no alpha channel view? Hello, webcrawl. Security mode. I'm just trying to find a higher-res brick texture that looks roughly similar. I'm thinking this one here is good. Although it's lacking in the contrast department, but we can just crank that up. There we go. Oh god. You have to check invasion twice. There's water here. I'm not thirsty. Many, many people have suggested me to port that over, but so far I have not wanted to do that. We can multiply it, but it does not multiply the alpha channel, which is very unfortunate. Brightness to opacity. Converting brightness to opacity is easy. You think I should just do that with this one here? But that's not what your thing looks like, right? It's like, maybe, oh, it's inverted brightness to opacity. Oh, I see. Yeah, I see. Now it makes sense. So you probably just did this, right? And like, this is your opacity layer? Do it with a new brick texture? Really with this one here? Okay, I'll just do as I'm told. Seems a little too dark, or too opaque, but we'll try it. Hmm, not a big fan yet. I'm just releasing a video, unopenable door opens. Wait, what's the unopenable door? I don't remember an unopenable door in Mario 64. Oh, okay. That's kind of hype. Why does this texture look so poopy? I think because it's lacking all the cool contrast from the texture Biobak initially used. Fuck it, I'm cheating. What are you trying to do? Make a good texture. Basically, we want shiny walls here, but we want the walls to look like they are. Yeah, you get the idea. I think the main mistake here is maybe that my texture is too bright. It's not so geometric, unless it's not snow, and we're mostly just testing with the art right now. We can still randomize stuff later. Are you using black and white textures? I am using a black and white texture. There we go, that's a lot better. Okay. Obviously, we don't want the overflow. Maybe I can make the shine a little darker to have this be more icy, but eh. Why is this looking so different? Let me think about this. This was Biobak's one. Obviously, it looks better. I'm just trying to figure out what the big difference is. There's more blue tones in there. That's one thing for sure. Can you make the mineshine diagonal? I think that would look awesome. Technically possible, but it's a lot harder to work with. Yep, that's the main difference. Oh, I see. It just looks better because he touched it and not me. I see how it is. Could it be because his thing has more color depth? What if we do something like... That's God awful. That's a lot better. Interesting. Subtracting these two does nothing now. I am so confused. Oh no, Biobak. I know that feeling with instant noodles. Zeyna and her family says I can't eat spicy because I'm white, but they're literally water British. So honestly, they have no right to talk about me being white in regards to spicy. Why is this so nice and then the other one is so ass? Let me try this. Is Twitch not linked? Should be. Dude, how does this go purple? It's not purple. Where is the purple coming from? I made it blue. Am I just fucking insane? What is going on? I'm just going to look at this in-game. There's no way Blender is rendering this right. Nice. Oh, my God. This is ugly. How does Biobak picking a fucking random blue texture just look better than me actually Is this not just combiner? Oh, wait, because this is so there we go. Yeah, that's so much nicer. Hello, surreal. All right. You know what? I'm just going to program the text animation and then then we see about it. Is that the texture in Biobak picking it up? Because that's such a common texture. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know. It's the set pal size comment, right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11. Scroll bit flag is what we use. Okay, there we go. This is. I. Okay. Now it should just be permanently scrolling and we're going to do the camera dependent thing afterwards. I don't think it needs to be readable, especially stuff like that. Actually, this is readable. I don't know. It's a good issue. This looks a lot worse in game than it looked in Blender. Oh, my God. Quantization really fucked us over. Holy shit. Yikes. What is quantization? Okay. So what you're seeing in Blender is the texture as it is on your hard drive. But when you import the thing in game, it's going to be transformed into a Mario 64 format, which means that a lot of bit values are going to be quantized into a lower format, right? For example, your computer has like eight bits for red, green and blue, but Mario 64 only has five bits. Whereas Mario 64, especially for alpha, we only have one bit for alpha, meaning the shine can only be on or off on every pixel. And because he's RGBA 16, it means it's going to be quantized down to that and it's just going to look like ass like this. The format that we used there was RGBA 16. This is the format with IA8, which, you know, the quantization looks a lot less bad because now it's four bit alpha instead of one. But obviously it's still not good. Let me actually scroll the shine here, because that's not the shine. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. August minted? Is it possible to make a blend plugin to emulate the quantization? Yes. I don't know why it's not emulated. It wouldn't be that difficult, I think. Make it a feature request. Ask Lina to do it for you. Yeah, so now you can see the shine scroll, but obviously the colors are not as nice anymore. All right, let's experiment with the colors a little bit. I think we can get this to work. Can we just make this an additive shine? I guess it doesn't look quite as good as if it's an additive shine. Hmm. It's a shame the yellow takes over as soon as we do this. Let's do it. Wait, if the texture itself is the alpha mask, why don't we just... Oh, God. Doesn't look as nice and icy anymore but there's a solution i think what do you guys think of something like this frosty good it's gonna be a bit annoying to program but let's try it uh five three seven zero so that's one seven and also we need to restore the end color comment here zero one two three four five six seven don't ask about this one so so so how long is this video because this last video was four hours there's some assembly in here yeah that looks pretty frosty if you ask me so z fighting here is because well the z's are fighting i can remove that real quick if that's going to distract that otherwise someone make a gif of like that little baby kitten like trying not to fall asleep but then falling asleep anyway and then below it says z fighting or something i am not a 3d modeler so no you make it i don't wanna you make it i'm busy streaming 5 4 2 1 8 um there  you know what actually no dividing by 256 seems like a good decision when you release this game alone you said it was a newer version made not like luigi monster of the castle when they release that version nope i just made that video to grab some kind of lighting related stuff to put in multiple other different snapplays and videos games. That is controversial. The emulator does not have a virus but it means that people can program a virus to give you a virus and have it run on the emulator. It's kind of moving the opposite direction of what I want. Let's do this and maybe 16. Also I don't like the colors really. Something about the colors is pissing me off. So I do think the way some things are red like the random grass. I think it looks weird. How should it look? There's grass in it right? We're trying to make a reflect texture. No. Actual reflections are just not a thing we can do. Most we can do like a CPU generator reflection. But we're faking it. 7 3 2 1 8. Well 7 3 2 1 3 is kind of nice I think. What do you think? Yay or nay? I think this is the right ratio. It looks so cool. The one thing I dislike is the instant switch when I do this. It doesn't actually move with the camera. It just moves instantly. I have to feel. The transparency looks fucked. I think the one thing that looks fucked is this part here. But that's not supposed to be in the game. I should get this directly from the camera matrix again. You thought the z-fighting was on purpose? Interesting concept. I think the camera updates at the end of Mario's behavior. Yep. That's what I thought. Alright so this is what we should just use. These two. And since we can invert this here. We just need Kamsa. And we can continue 16. And I think we inverted by doing this. 2 2 0 0. That should make the shine a bit smoother. I forgot the semicolon. Hello Ashi. You prefer glitter pop mash? Okay. You're back from the video chat chat. I imagined panic or whatever in this especially awful YouTube live chat. What is titration? Titrate these nuts. So what's the glitch on how to open the TTM door? Because I don't know which that has the power to do that. Is this the wrong way around or the right way around? I'm not sure right now. I feel like this is the right way around. We make the gradient diagonal instead of horizontal. Again this is going to be a difficult question for you to answer. But how am I supposed to do that? Yeah you don't see the shine moving. The white we should make the shine wider actually. Cool because it's an ice castle. Yeah twice the size is better. It's like an ally with different gaps of white and non-white. I think it's like 80 percent done. 2031. You know what? 2031 compared to some other remakes wouldn't even be that bad. You saw the dark moving? Well I guess that makes sense. Either way now that we have this working let's get back to room planning. I'm sure it will release before Yandere Sim. Come on. You know it's going to be the Raven Claimant. What else do we have planned? Sliding ice cube that you can stand on to get over spikes or something. Maybe even as like a bobsled thing. I think that would work. Ice block. Actually no I don't like that. Nevermind. I changed my mind. Yes the source code will release. Despite what people seem to think I will release the source code. I don't know why people think I don't. I literally even released the source code for Peach's Fury which is like most of the source code from this. So that's a little cringe. Oh well. It wasn't even the only one that said it. There were like two so. I don't have strong opinions on open source now. Big swinging exit room on top. I'm actually not sure about this. Oh my god the question mark. Actually maybe. That sucks. Casey you got a fan brought to your room. Not clean room in the slightest. We just pretended this. No Arthur it's clean room. Shut the fuck up. It's clean room. Trust me bro. Alright so these are rooms I have noted down. I'm thinking this should. Actually the way I think this ice castle should be is that every. Why did I just get 500 hi dad comments. What. And they all happen at once. You know what that's a cryptocurrency promotion calling it. It's a cryptocurrency promotion. There's like a cryptocurrency called that or something for sure. Okay I'm thinking every room is like a distinct idea for platforming that you have to overcome somewhere. So a slide room would work. A room where it's just like you walk up a thing and there's like someone trying to work. Somehow like a staircase room. I'm thinking maybe till I get higher up in the castle and reach the boss. An abyss room kind of like platforming above the void. And of course the ice cold area I mentioned earlier where you have to get on the thing near the fire to like recover basically. We changed ice physics a slight bit. Hello Karim. We should have the exact same ice puzzle from monsters manor. Oh no. We don't do puzzles like that actually. Of course the ice where stuff only appears in a mirror but also I kind of don't like this concept. I think it's not that creative and it's kind of like something we already did so maybe no. You did your thing for yourself. The reason I'm doing this is because I am evil actually. I'm fucked up like that. Just straight up a bad person. Yeah he looks really good Zeyna. Yeah one area where the frame buffer is not cleared. So it's gonna look it's gonna look very busy daisy. A very foggy area I think could work. I'm thinking we even do like fake volumetric fog. Which is like almost per pixel. Which maybe you guys remember that video from the PC port. Kind of like that but better hopefully. A room with the appearing path. And then this is a very trippy room idea I had. Where you'd walk somewhere and the further you go the bigger the room gets. So you can never actually reach the end of the room. But this is gonna be a little bit awkward to program. Not sure if I this. So probably not doing this one. Yeah lost woods hex room kind of thing. Where we do the brick idea. The fake normal map thing I said earlier. May work but I'm not 100% on it. Because I feel like the gameplay in this is gonna be kind of lame. It's like what are we gonna do? I just made a text document called Super Mario 32. Guess we make this in 32 years. Oh my god, who bought all these bots? How is this possible? Someone must have spent like $50 on bots to just spam that in my chat. Yeah, I mean that would be kind of the idea for tomorrow room, but I'm not a big fan of it. Kind of sucks, but 70 viewers is 70 viewers. I don't think they even view the stream, I think they just write one message and then post it again. I'm very surprised they actually responded to me. Let's try this again, is this a song request? Alright, definitely a room with reflective ice floor, we for sure have this. A frozen lake room, yeah this would work really well in the bottom part of this. This could also actually be combined with the ice cold room. I'm so long, I think they just wrote a message on 50 different computers and ran across the room pressing all the enter keys. Oh, they could have like 50 tabs open. Reflection ice wasn't Sophie's Zelda, it's so unoriginal. It was in the RGY8 demo, so Sophie would be the unoriginal one. Not that it's a creative idea at all. The room with the ice packs and the ice cube, yes I like that one a lot. Okay, what a star idea. We have one platforming gauntlet, we have another platforming gauntlet, we have the 8-bit pipe which is also kind of a platforming gauntlet, yeah. Did you bench P using your engine? I'm not 100% sure if I did. It's so funny, you actually looked this up? The first game of the Reflective Ice Link probably released in like 1984. Anyway, I want to think more about this. Okay, let's have an idea for the general layout. So I'm thinking the general shape of the castle will be something kind of like this and then it goes up here somewhere to a boss and maybe like down here it goes down into the basement. This should be like a main foyer here where you can go upstairs or you can see upstairs but you can actually go there. Maybe get some rooms here that you can platform up on. On both sides like up and down, maybe something like this. I do want there to be a connection from here to here or maybe like from here to here. War Slayer and your peasants shall bow down to him, worship him if you don't attend all the MCA. Who is writing these? You don't have mod powers Biobak? Well, it's not like you could ban all the bots anyway, there's so many of them. Someone earlier asked if you had Onlyfans, I do not. I don't think there's enough money in Onlyfans for me to have it be worth it. Otherwise, I absolutely, no, I don't think Zayna would let me. Would also be really weird. Dude, how do you have an Onlyfans and then go to a family gathering? It's like, yeah, my entire family saw my cock. Like, how do you live your life like that? 40 to 50k, but that's probably like a top 0.001% guy, right? Technically, they saw your cock when you were younger. Dang, I guess there's nothing to lose anyway. Oh, we could have the castle also be like this and then have to be like a bridge between these. Oh, I like that a lot. Oh yeah, oh, oh yes, yes, yes. Let's do that. Towers in front and back of the castle. Bridge connecting the H shape. Spots the castle so you can walk over. That's going to look really cool. No, honestly, I think that's a fair point, Arthur. Who would not take that deal? Best part about Onlyfans is when your kids go, well, he finds your Onlyfans. If you make 50k a month, your kid doesn't need to go to school. They can get like a private teacher or something. They can change school every week if a kid finds out. Like, who cares? And so this is going to be like the entrance stairs then, basically. Let's notate down the stars we already have. Petrom Gauntlet to a star you see early on. So you'll probably like go in here, go up here, maybe like walk through here. And star one would actually be in the foyer right where you see it, like up here. Start free boss fight with the big raven. We already said that would be here. For the cold haze rooms, you would go here and then go up here. Hmm. Hey guys, this is Casey. Otherwise, I do have an Onlyfans. Oh, God. Am I getting banned on this from Twitch because they think I'm botting? I think my career is over. Congratulations. You've received 1000 messages today with restreamed chat. I wonder where those messages are from. Hmm.  Get Sari bot. Is this the scam? You just create the problem and then you're selling me a bot? Hmm. Star five is obviously outside the bit pipe. Yes, the bit pipe. I feel like if we have the bridge here to connect the towers and then we put the bit pipe just like in front of the castle, that would be fucking hype as fuck. This kind of gives every room in the castle a purpose already, because you can go here, disconnect. There's nothing really in the castle where I'm like, well, this sucks. There are also banned bot rates. Well, that would be helpful. Hmm. Sierra is doing better now. I know that's what hair does. It grows. Oh, shit. That reminds me, guys. Surely one of you guys is a giga nerd. How do you efficiently sell Yu-Gi-Oh cards? We have a fucking shit ton of Yu-Gi-Oh cards. I don't want. I wanted a bunch of old school cards. We got way too many new school cards. They are incomprehensible garbage. There's so much effect on them. I hate it. I just want to get rid of them. They're probably like, there's a bunch of cards I saw in there. They're like at least like three, four dollars worth. There's like a thousand of them. Time wise or efficient money per card wise?  Like a good min-max. I'm not grading my free send cards. I saw some places that will pay you like three cents per holo. And that just seems like way too little. A list of every card you own and just sell them and even book. Writing down every card I own is too much work to be worth it. I checked the value of like 10 cards. And I saw that like two of them were worth more than one. Two of them were worth more than four dollars. So I know that there is some in there. But checking the value of every card is not worth my time. If you consider my time an investment, then I actually lose money on that. Oh God. Who gave a 10 year old their mom's credit card and now they're paying for this? Much better. Wait, did they get banned? Oh, someone cleared it. Very nice. Um, okay. I want to think of more cool star ideas. Maybe there's a way that we can like destroy the snowmen or something. Or something with the ravens. Oh, it's in follow only mode. Zelda, I'm not entering the cards one by one. Stop. R9K mode. Oh, can you do that? Someone do that. That would be perfect. There should be like a very big intimidating entrance here. I think I would like that a lot. Make intimidating entrance to the castle. With a very dog that looks like a mouse with teeth. That's what I'm thinking. Spending a missing card deck and posting an email like you don't know what they are. Hawksnit. But I feel like they're worth more when people see what they are. Because like it's unsorted, right? I didn't pick out all the good ones. Maybe I'll just sell them like a bulk of 100 holos at a piece at a time. That's probably what I'll do. Hmm. Right, it's so difficult. If you take steroids and you don't work out, you will still build a good amount of muscle, actually. Call and free my opinion on that. It's like a 7 out of 10 emoji. Zelda, they are not old cards. That's the entire problem. Interesting idea, Vioback. I don't know, like 4 years at most. Can we make the hex room thing decent at all? Where it's like a Lost Woods type maze. I don't think we can. Yeah, I'm not sure. I want to take advice from a guy talking about Black Magician on selling Yu-Gi-Oh cards. That's like saying Zelda is the main character of The Legend of Zelda. Yes, I have been listening to the Kirby Forgotten Land OST. You don't like it? Alright, we'll move on. No, I specifically said it's not old cards. Black Magician is a real name, it's not a joke. I don't think that's true. Is there maybe something we can do with killing enemies? Oh my god, all the followers are driving me nuts. Are all the bots following me now? It's all the bots. I'm gonna get driven insane. Doesn't Beachfest have a secret where you get a flashcard and can't get the patch from to work? It is N64 compatible. It should just work out of the gate. I can play it on my N64 and everyone else was able to do it too. Could you get the ROM to work on an emulator? Is it true to remove the bot followers? Yeah, but that's not my responsibility, let someone else do that. Maybe we can make the snowman slide into a separate star? Like there's just one path in the castle that leads to the snowman here? Just like a snowman tower somewhere? You can check it on the emulator, Sarah. If it doesn't work on the emulator, then you know you patched it wrong. Otherwise, there's an option and that is that your N64 maybe only has 4MB of memory. In which case, you would be missing the expansion pack. Brainstorming stream? More like mapping out the level stream. If we do go with the snowman path, maybe there would be a hill next to the castle here? So the castle would be halfway in the hill and then the snowman is inside the hill. I'm thinking something like this.  There we go. Oh, I see, Sarah. Yeah, that would do it. I have a few followers, but... So this one will be 1 to the snowman cave path. So this would distinctly lead into a cave here. I think that's our best option. Snowman cave. The snowman cave entrance has to be a significant... To visual shift and how it looks um away from aligned building inside geometry geometry that way we can make this look distinctly different i don't know why so is it just you and dan being silent to each other and that is probably not i think this works next move we have to do is put the rooms into like a photoshop file and then align them together so that we can get a fun layout dude the follow alert is driving me insane i can't why i don't want this many followers can't you just turn it off i hope so i hope i don't crash no that didn't work what if i do this does this work it doesn't work it keeps going sorry for following it's the bots not you and can i be refunded the five 1500 points i used to ask a stupid question well i mean you just ask one so the points are gone no maybe a mod can refund you i don't know disable the window mute sound it doesn't work i don't know do it wait maybe what's the thing called again streamlabs let me just turn this off wait it's only like 20 followers here i'm just gonna click the skip alert button a few times so i clicked the disable follow alerts button like one second surely we can figure this out dude what the fuck try the other one what other one stream elements wait no i don't use stream elements never been on here it's bizarre it's only showing me like 10 followers so wait alert master volume zero percent i just set it to zero does it work it's gone it is possible sarah especially peaches fury i'm sure you could do it but it would be a lot of work and i don't want to do it all right um we start the photoshop file on this we're gonna we're gonna make blocks for each room and then in each room we're just gonna be able to move them around and well and that's gonna be very useful maybe we should color code them depending on what type of room they are let's make the platforming room some red for bing bing wahoo i'll show you the games i don't know enough about those games to know whether it's possible i would imagine it is most of the time ice wave room i need a different font where is healthy to go i don't have it cool oh no ether that sucks four years is indeed a long ass time um i would like the shape of the rooms to kind of match like the shape the rooms are actually gonna have in the final game i would mod lila and Biobak actually let me try that slash mod Biobak does this work what's lila's name again lila 3 1 0 or something i think with two a's so and we have to climb up a slide with no enemies okay that's gonna be in the cave so we don't want this and the snowman cave so i'm mod i think so i think i modded you were you not mod before i don't see who's mod from here it's lila free tv interesting staircase rooms okay we need two staircase rooms i think or more than that i'll wait lila's lila free tv oh okay did you mod the wrong person probably it is what it is if the wrong lila ever comes in here i guess she can fuck my stuff up what's your question bcb board so you don't think that your mods maybe it didn't work that would be too bad i can't go into a script and just make sure that it works so yep but send your mod now how it can be to mod someone well i used the restream thing so i'm not sure that the restream thing works right because if i just type in a comment there i don't know that it actually goes through to twitch ice cold area we definitely want that the ice cold area has to be even bigger it's going to be like a whole thing here oh actually maybe this is a good size so will the anime in the future be willing to help someone with no knowledge of coding bring a fan oh but where stuff only appears in the mirror do we want that i don't think so i think i'm just gonna kill this room so biomech is mod now yes frame buffer not cleared area brain buffer not cleared area we have to combine this with something it has to be like a diner room or a chapel or something or a big hall or can this just be a random room it's gonna be in this room it's more like an idea for like the background or something not for like the main attraction you know what i mean i can imagine like a big long hallway here with like ice on both sides and you just go through it and maybe there's like things in there that attack you i've never done big long hallway surrounded by ice um maybe one or two intense times in here question mark maybe the inbounds no idea what i'm doing um we are kind of trying to organize our workspace so that we can plan the geometry of the castle yeah it's basically level designing and we need a different color for this i guess the trippy stuff will mark with green green seems good yeah i was just rippling and i miss paints i'm using photoshop because it's a bit um miss layers chartreuse what is chartreuse it's so weird to see games not working in jangsa's lab anymore has it been that much time that i've been working on it okay we have an idea for a very foggy area the question is what's going to be the backdrop for this we have the idea for like a chapel we have a great hall we have a jail dungeon type area i feel like a jail dungeon type area would work well with this a jail dungeon type area should also be in the basement i'm trying to think what would happen in yeah let's just let's just do this in the jail here jail slash dungeon i'm trying to think what would happen in yeah let's just let's just do this in the jail here it should be a relatively small room i think something like this shape so i don't remember that because i remember you saying it's gonna be weird to play the game and not have keys use l to levitate when you're going somewhere that's how i don't remember that was an oily body bay rumor for elective ice floor with a frozen lake yeah that should be the same thing i think so see aether i'm all that won't let you leave it's designed so confusing that you always end up back at the gift store this is a real experience you had so sounds kind of nice so well it's a castle so we're not having a mall in a castle there is an outside area outside area is planned  outside the grass is outside now it's all snow don't worry you won't have to touch grass a room with spikes and an ice cube to stand on all right i think this is a good size for that if you want to change the size of rooms you can still do that um it's like sure um these are all the room ideas i have so far we can easily align them to make a castle and it should work well we still need the main floor actually i guess that's maybe we should have a different color for that one just like the color for the rooms that glue everything together i'm gonna make note of blue rooms main foyer with slidey stairs and upstairs so so all the important stuff out of this but we probably need a few more things here um but that will require brainstorming and i think i'd rather do that off stream i think that's all i'll do on stream for today um probably by the next stream i'll have it organized into a castle and i'll start the 3d modeling on it so next stream we will be making significant progress in this this will go from weird concepting to actual level real fast so yeah i'll see you guys next stream bye bye
