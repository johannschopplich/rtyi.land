Hello gang! Hello Mel XT, hello Victor Eduardo, hello Awesome Mario, hello Prosimity, hello Korenji. The world is over, the world is not over. The world is gonna keep going for a little bit. Yes it's Pachyderm! Last? Yes, this is probably the last overworld stream, after this we are probably done with the overworld. And then it's side-level time. Hello Minus Mario. What's the last thing I showed you guys in the overworld? I'm not sure. We're probably gonna have an entire side-level that's just on the surface of a planet. I think it's gonna be really cool. Samitizer is working on this one right now. Like it's just an actual planet. How cool is that? This is not the coolest thing ever? Is it just me that's thinking that? Non-Cloudtaker. Hello Korenji. Yeah, what do you think of this level? I think this is gonna be like the coolest thing ever. I'm so fascinated by this concept. This would likely be like a red coin mission. So there will just be eight red coins here and you're just gonna collect the red coins on the planet. I have not looked at it yet, sorry. We make a lot of progress in the stream today, we might take a look at it afterwards. It's gonna be savory. This would have gone pretty hard on the N64. It is the day of the Valentine's True. I wish I wasn't so stressed with other things in life and I could actually have a Valentine's Day. But there's way too many things. I need some time. I've been detailing as I add now your old levels look bad. Well, the main pleasure in graphics is going to come from the way the colors play together and things like that. So let's see how that goes. Is there a good 11.0.1? That was changing. Obviously, it is possible to do this on the N64 and my thing doesn't explicitly support it, but it is possible to modify it to support it. But also, if that was your goal, then my approach would be the wrong one anyway. Had that been the goal, I would have gone with a different approach. It didn't slip it. There we go. Yup, yup, yup. No, he's an asshole. My approach was rotating the level itself, is what you're saying? No, I mean, it depends on your definition of rotation and the level. Hello, Biobank. You just learned you're a mathematician? You are, bro. You're a color mathematician. You're doing math with colors. There's nothing you can do about it. Ew, brother. What is that? What's that, brother? Ew. Ew. Are you telling me you're fucking with the color combiner and you don't feel like a mathematician? I don't believe you. Object does not have a layer named UV map? Bizarre. All we're interested in is the run of a bone. What's not run of a bone? His tail. The verdict was found with significant weight difference between two things. Makes sense. There we go. Let's see if we have an idea of what I want to make and I mess with the combiner slots until it works. Yeah, that's called numerics. Hello, Marty. Welcome to the stream. An alarm just told my stream. What an honor. Okay. Okay, biome background. Marty, now that you're here, I want to show you the cool thing. This is going to be a site level that Samitize is working on. I made planetary gravity work with non-flat planets so we can have a red coin level that's like on a planet. It's going to be so cool. Yeah. And it's like literally just one button to export it. So the engine just supports the whole level on a planet now. Could you spawn a Goomba on the planet without picking anything else? No, absolutely not. Not even close. You couldn't even place a coin without doing anything else. You need to do matrix math for everything. But geometry works and visuals work. So that's all we need. This is a shader trick. It's like a flat planet against a bandit or Mario is actually on a sphere like Mario Galaxy style. Neither. It is a sphere, but it's also a shader trick. Congrats on the final overworld stream case. That's harshly to speak. Any OST wishes for today? Do we want some music? Did I show you guys NetBeanuts? I don't think I did. Yeah, I'm getting- I have my shit blocked on. I'm getting so much work done, even though everyone wants me to do shit all the time. Metal Gear- Okay, that's a good one. You know what? They should like not make- Oh, I'm in the middle of this. They should not make Metal Gear Revengeance 2. Instead, they should make a Metal Gear Revengeance movie. That's what I want. Do you think you have 100% original code? I have done basically everything that no one else has offered to do. So from my side, it's 100% complete. And I'm just waiting now. Until- Well, I'm waiting until I can't wait anymore, right? Why not take the paralyzation if you can? Oh, I don't care about Metal Gear. I don't care about Metal Gear Revengeance. Metal Gear? Hello, Samuel. I was wondering if you suck at complex maps, but the combiner lets you test until you find what you want. That's true. I mean, that's true that the combiner lets you test. Not that's true that you suck. Who should play Raiden? If there's a Metal Gear Revengeance movie. I know like two actors. I know- Second. I know Margot Robbie. She played Barbie. I know Will Smith. He played Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Tom Hanks, the Scientology guy. Bruce Willis. Arnold Schwarzenegger. So, my choice of superstar to play Raiden is rather limited. Oh, and I know who Hunter Schaefer is because of Twitter discourse. That's my purview of actors. Vin Diesel? I don't know who that is. I've heard the name, but I don't have a face. Jim Carrey, of course. Fucking, I know Jim Carrey. He's the best one. Almost forgot the goat. The Rock. True, I know The Rock. Chris Pratt. Oh, that's Mario, but I don't know what he looks like. Actually, I have kind of like a little bit of an image of what he looks like. Samuel Jackson. Heard the name, don't know who that is. Oh, Robert Downey Jr., the guy from the motherfucking memes. The one who explains memes and he's like in greyscale. Did I just export him to group zero? No way, brah. Clearly, you don't know that. Yeah, exactly. That's Robert Downey Jr. to me. I don't know who that is. What does that mean? Is that fucked up? It's just a shame that almost all celebrities abuse children. Wait, what? Where's this coming from? It's really final, let's see if I'm going to clickbait. I don't give a fuck about my views. Actually, I do care a little bit about my views. But definitely not enough to clickbait anyone on Twitch. This is Oliver Fellow. He is Peckyderm. He's from Yoshi's Story. He's an asshole. He's an asshole. So the way I had envisioned... The way I had envisioned this is this Yoshi here. He would be like, oh my god, Mario, I love you, I'm going to try and help you on your journey. And then you come back later, maybe with 50 stars or so. And he has a star in his house. But Peckyderm is standing in front of his house. And he's just saying, nope, you can't get in. And then Yoshi's like, oh no, Mario, I found a star, but... This piece of shit is blocking the path. Did I? What? How is this not Peckyderm's view? Trying to get some work done on C15, but you have new game syndrome? Oh no. I've seen the Mewgenics thing you posted. It looked interesting. You can't get in. That's from Was guckst du? Was guckst du? That was a funny show. I was probably 9 years old when I last saw it. Incredible game. Okay. Then what, you never get the star? Yeah, exactly. The star's just here and you never get it. It's just there to tease you. It's the secret 201st star. That's what I was thinking. Why are you not solid, bro? Oh, because intelligible time is not set to 0. Just make sure the condition's the right size. Ayayana, true. Oh, that's the stream? Disastrous. I have a feeling I can cheat into here. Remove collision. Why? Could you just be a giant yet? Probably. Not a fast enough measure to be a giant yet here, maybe. If... Okay, that was too easy. You should not be PLJing into it like that. But yes, you can PLJ into it. How's my PLJ can W make it? In vanilla Mario 64, yes. In this game, I think once I actually have a collision map, it might not be possible to clip into here anymore. Obviously I can clip into it with a non-finished collision. There's some kind of weird ceiling here. But in RTYI, generally how fast you go doesn't really matter for a PLJ. So next, the idea is you beat him the same way you beat him in Yoshi's Story, which is to ground pound next to him and then drop him to his feet. Yes, you can actually get the star. I was shitposting with my mouth. Okay. I'm thinking... A nice mid-game star, like 57. Swimson is actually replaced by the bunnies. He's replaced by the bunnies. Five-seven! Okay, no, we're not expanding the meme. I can't even say five-seven anymore. You guys have gone off the cuff. Okay. Everyone loves to ground pound stars in Odyssey. That's not why they hate them. They don't hate it because it's a ground pound. They hate it because it's uninspired and boring and obvious and filler. But this is not filler. There's a whole new guy here. That was so cringe. Don't ever do that again. Six-seven! Stop me! Six-seven! What if on the other side of his sign there's a green go sign and you have to climb on the roof and kick the signs and flips and then he lets you enter? Nah, this is just how you beat Pachyderm in the game. So it's like... Hmm. But now that you mention it, that might be a little easier to figure out. You know what, just for the visual communication, we might actually just fucking do it. I did Noroboro, but just this one time we have to violate it by only going a hundred coordinates, because otherwise you can't see it. It's the same standard they used in R64, but then stopped using halfway through making the game. Fuck it, we'll go with the go sign. What does the go sign look like? I'm stupid, guys. No, I think it needs to be the go sign only. Just for communication reasons. I think that's a little bit... Maybe both, yeah. Let's just have text that says go. Something like this. Or maybe like a... I like this. We should do this. Buy a back gate so you can change it later. Me when I remake the decomposition of Mario 64. Oh, there's enough unobtainable things in the game that that won't be an issue. This is bizarre. Icon packs, free icon. So basically this son of a bitch is getting free icons, and basically you are fucking stupid. What happened to that meme? That's why I'm going with a thumbs up emote, because if it's a text it might not be translating. Nice. Nice symbol. That's not how you spell thumb. But it's fine. You're going to go in all European languages. What about Chinese? This Mario, we couldn't get the rights to goomba, true. Yeah, Mario is the only Mario character in Return of the Yoshi's Islands. The elephants have thumbs though. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. The elephants have thumbs though? No, this guy doesn't even have arms. Does it matter? I don't know why. I don't want to add those extra triangles just for that. I don't know why. Why last overworld stream? Because after this we're done with the overworld. Why else would it be the last one? Are people reading this as like I'm quitting romhacking after this overworld stream or something? Are you a fan of metamusic? Not really. I'm such an idiot. Don't worry. The game is cancelled, we're just working on it today for another two hours. So my birthday yesterday was the download link? Oh, it was there yesterday. I said again released on your birthday, not after your birthday. I didn't call the solidify function. And his height is too much. I need a game for six months. It's today. Okay, I will come out for his next birthday. Just for you, I'm gonna give you a whole extra year of delay. Heard him say it, game is cancelled. Take the clip out of context, post it on reddit, post it on twitter. He's right. Neon bone, that was nice. Banger song. Well, the swimming isn't really in the demo, it's in the bonus level only. So once you get to the actual real game, the swimming is actually going to be explained to you as you play. So it shouldn't be a problem. You hear that? Mountains will not give back what they take. You hear that? You hear that? Poor guy just gets knocked the fuck out. Hello Godstuff. Hey guys, I'll not be editing this video today, so have fun while you're watching the stream. Hello. What type of broad collision check is the engine using? Some kind of PSP or RP3? I am using BVH. So vanilla Mark 64 uses a cell grid with 16 cells. What's a 256? Is it 32? It's one of those. We have lots of plans with bonus stages. What's a 256? I am using BVH. So what's a 266? I am using BVH. What's a 266? I am using BVH. What's a 266? What's a 266? How are you? Hello, how are you? Why do you need to know? That's a personal question. Unbelievable. I can't believe it. It might be new to the stream, but I hate when people ask me that. I'm traumatized living in a North American country, coming from Germany. And everyone's like, hello, how are you? It's like, I don't want to think about that. What? Hello, what are your retirement plans? That was almost awesome. Hello, do you think there's a life after death? There will be blood, blood and shame. The only thing I fear for now. Frickin' Guiltum, yeah, it's awesome, isn't it? I love this. He should put his face in the dirt though, and now he can go get the star. I haven't animated any cutscenes yet. Yeah, I actually agree that maybe I should just make the edge neutral. Yeah, neutral. That could work. And now he looks down in shame. Why is Visual Studio called that? Are you setting it as a photo editing software because of visual thing? I guess because it visually shows you your project. You make a fair point. Blood, blood, shame. There will be blood, blood and shame. The only thing I fear for now. Blood, blood and shame. Battle from the dragon's mane. Because the mountains don't give back what they've taken. I know there will be blood, blood and shame. It's the only thing I fear for now. I know there will be blood, blood and shame. It could be this actually. This way we can make sure that we can still add things here in the future. I know there will be blood, blood and shame. It's the only thing I fear for now. Blood, blood and shame. Battle from the dragon's mane. Because the mountains don't give back what they've taken. Because the mountains don't give back what they've taken. Using the helmet, red circles, all of course, 59 that I know it saves for him. Nice! Maybe the elephant could take the headphones, they've fallen over. Yeah, I just want them to look sad. What, armless goofy elephant? He's an asshole! Why are you feeling bad for him? Then we just need to do the Yoshi text here. And now we can get the star. This is such a cool mission. I kinda love this. This is so funny. Time to do the Yoshi text. Battle from the dragon's mane. Because the mountains don't give back what they've taken. I know there will be blood, blood and shame. It's the only thing I fear for now. 2, 4, 6, 8, 9. 9? That's quite stupid. We're going to need to make him appear a little later then. 178. We're going to need to make him appear a little later then. Now your observatory basically has no RAM usage. No, we're not restoring and randomizing those beta objects. If this stuff that was good enough to make it into a final game is not good enough to make it into the air, what makes you think the beta objects will make it? I don't know. Beta? B3313? No way! B3313? No way! 50 kilobytes is nothing. You have like 3 megabytes just for the level. You have like 3 megabytes just for the level. Put a big Einstein Island in the game? Einstein Island? Is that made up? I really can't tell. It's like rocks. Is that made up? I really can't tell. It's like rocks. Is that made up? I really can't tell. It's like rocks. Did you produce 64 Game Jam games? I have not. Did you produce 64 Game Jam games? I have not. I've seen there were some cool stuff though. I've seen there were some cool stuff though. I also think they meant Epstein. Writing Einstein is very funny. Okay, that should not work. What could be going on? Whatever, I'm open. The moon is in the way. Unfortunately, man, I'm so busy, I don't have time to play games. Until at least the 25th, I don't think I'll have time. I haven't played games in a long time. It is the Yoshi that's crashing. Wait, what the fuck? Why did no one tell me I did that? Did you get to enjoy Valentine's much? No. Very busy right now. We're buying a house. It's tax season coming up. And my parents are visiting right now. And I've taken on more projects than I should have. No, no, no, we're buying the house we're staying in right now. The streams are going to stay in the basement. The Superman was blocking my hat and I can't reach it. I'm coming here from nowhere. For the unforgiving sea. I'm drifting further and further. It's all becoming clear to me. The violent winds are blowing. Can you reach it with a punch? Yes. You don't have to jump here. Alright, isn't yours? Well, it's... There was like a weird thing where Zayna's father-in-law bought it first. And then we're buying it from him. Because I didn't have the history. The tax history. You need like two years of tax history as a self-employed person. Yeah. It isn't going to be a change in my life at all. But it's a lot of stupid paperwork I have to do. I didn't think buying a house was going to need that much paperwork. Yeah, the paperwork is the worst part. I should now instantly update his texts. There was one more thing I wanted to do. Did I save the game? Right, I need to despawn Pachyderm when the star has been collected. Was this not star ID 0x10? It should be. Okay, it might just not work this way. Let's see. I don't see why it wouldn't work. Cool, cool, cool. RBN purchased? I don't think they are. What the hell? What the hell? What the hell? What the hell? I should despawn the star now. I've seen that one key is now RTA viable? What? How? What are you going to do after you release this? Move to Hawaii? Sip on Chucky Milk? Live the good life? Guys literally only want one thing and it's Chucky Milk. Hurry before the setup using water for the build speed. It takes 3 hours. Okay, but that doesn't make it RTA viable. You also need to navigate to the door. Push my nun down the stairs so I'm popping a Chucky Milk? I see. Poor nun. That's cheating. That's cheating. Overworld stars just not work here. Push the Chucky Milk down the stairs and your nun is angry? I would be angry too. That section was only 70% done. How have you made so much progress in such a short time? I missed. It is because I got finished with the 100% code stuff. I think I should update it to 90% now. The reason it took so long was because I was working on replacing all the codes. Most of the work I do in this game is off-stream, right? And you've just seen me work on the overworld on-stream. But off-stream I was working on replacing all the codes. And now I'm working on the overworld off-stream and also on the overworld on-stream. Drink your Chucky Milk with water instead? That's nasty. Why would you dilute it? Wait. It needs a 0x40 here. Is that why? I shouldn't have done it. I might have to debug. Hello, can I pay you? 0x40 when you don't tolerate the taste of milk? The taste of milk? The Asian buffet at where I live is also the optimal restaurant. And it's because you can eat as much as you want. Or a price that's only like 25% more expensive than a normal restaurant. Dude, I've been to a restaurant with the same size. And I hate restaurants. I think eating food at home is usually better than restaurants. But the Asian restaurant we go to, the sushi shop, that's better than eating at home sometimes. Infinite anything you want? Exactly. Exactly. Okay, we need to debug. Is this a song request? Oh no. RTA one key? In three hours? No, that's not what it says. I need to figure out what he's doing here. Huh? What? What was he doing? What? No, it only sounded like that because he was in the PU. And the further away you are, the higher pitched it is. This is Mario 64's version of the Doppler effect or something. Thank you for the sub, Zita Zita! Oh, inside castle. Oh. Huh. Okay, I don't know then. I just kind of picked them up as I went, honestly. I didn't really go in and try to learn. I just went in and tried to make things. And then as I made things, I had to learn. To land an extremely precise spawn to get to the door. Okay, so it is extremely precise. And he did that RTA? That's crazy. Fancy sushi, isn't it? Well, when I go to a sushi place, I don't eat the sushi either. Sushi, like uncooked fish, that's not really good food. I get everything but the sushi. I don't know. Well, it means minus one for the overworld. So that should be fine. Let's print this. Okay. Yeah, that is crazy for an RTA. 1FFB6. Am I crazy or something? I don't know. The flag is clearly set. I was reading the text and I was like, what? It's out of late. This is insane. Are these flipped? They're not flipped, right? They have to be flipped. Okay. It's harder than that. Go to 2. Okay. If it's set, go to the second one. Which is 6 or 5. I'm not saying I'm ending the streams. Guys! What are you saying? It's just the last overworld stream. We're just done with the overworld after this. Bro, if you were in a hospital and the doctor said this is your last day in the hospital, what would you be like? Oh no, I'm dying today! Or would you say, oh cool, I'm getting discharged. Depends on the face he's making. Funny concept. Doctor that makes an inappropriate face to make bad news seem like good ones. So he doesn't have to be the bearer of bad news. Your AIDS test has been pretty positive. Sorry. I have a bad sense of humor. Ace, you forgot. Is it just the fucking case the headshot thing again? It's tough to know what. Ready? Go! Go! Go! It's just the fucking case the headshot thing again. It's tough to know what. Right now I'm just the Paki Durham guy. Future streams? Side levels! Bug fixing! Maybe multiplayer. Because the overworld is done after this. No, just kidding. It's because after this we're deleting the whole project. We're just stopping. Okay, I don't think I get around just fucking debugging this. Fuck it. Oh yeah. Disassembly reading time. It's not clickbait! It is... You guys are just negative nancies and that's why you think it's clickbait. Marcos? What's Marcos? What's Marcos? Yeah, that's course one. That's course minus one. About the non-entanglement video, why I had to delete all of Super Mario 64's content. That would have been banger clickbait. What? 1FFE3, which is exactly what we were looking for. Indeed, V0V00X80? What? Oh, it checks for the intricacy. Okay. Well, we're not in the intro cutscene. So... Let's do another breakpoint here. Okay. 1FFE3. S0 should be 0X10. S0 is 6. Might just be a different place. That's fine. What? Did I skip over it by accident? There we go. S0 is 0X10. V0 is 1FFE3. Step, step, step. 0X10. That looks good. Literally all of that looks fine. Oh. Okay, I fixed the bug. I fixed the bug. Many of you as code have joined other editors. I've tried Windows Notepad, and I've tried Visual Studio. I hope that star helps. We fixed it. We fixed it. Which Visual Studio? I don't know. 22, I think. Yes, 22. Now, honestly, it feels crippling to develop for other platforms. Because Unreal Engine is so fucking slow, that every time you write code, it takes 15 times as long to get feedback. It's way more annoying to write something for modern computers. Plus, my knowledge on N64 is just much... ...much vaster. So I know how to do things I don't know how to do in modern engines. I don't know anything about them. What's the advantage? Alright! That's Pack-E-Durm done. That's another thing off my list. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure what I'm doing. That's 16 Overworld Stars done. No, it's 15 Overworld Stars done. There's one more Overworld start up planned, actually. The volcano erupts after X7, you're gonna get X7, you're going to get Banon. Beat this good Sage, and then we enter the area. Can erupts, and Lava enters the first area, and this creates a big stunt where we bully on it. The bully on the level was pretty stupid. I was fighting Lava in this instance, so... Okay, well I'm not 100% sold on this. With this, we finished 15 Secret Stars. That means, think about it. 15 courses with 7 stars is 105 stars. 15 Secret Stars in the Overworld is 120 stars. And, we have the 4 cap levels, 134 stars. And then we have side levels. And the 24 stars, and then we have side levels. So we're already around, I think, 130 stars in the game right now. Then 44 stars are going to be super easy, because they're the Yoshi stars. So... We are practically around 180 stars finished now. True, Biobank. Actually, why don't I give you a demonstration? I think it's time for Jack to let her rip! Firebag remakes are also going to take a long time, that is true. Let's see... Polish Aragorn! Let's download this. Take a look. I'm just really small, did you not know I'm 3 feet? Uh-oh! So we need an entrance for the level. My original plan was that there would just be a secret path here that would lead to it. Even your dream size is 4 feet. You want to be 4 feet? What the hell. Honestly smart, you can live in a smaller house and you can live off less food. Would save you so much money to be 4 feet. I think you do. How does this collision map I see? Oh, I see. Interesting strategy. It's a little bit of UV mapping here. A little bit of clipping here. I think I'll just do that. Oh, that's a little unclean. Okay, I need some UV mapping here as well. I can fix it though. Who made this? Uh, he's in chat. Polish Aragorn, Iris something in chat. Oh, this is a transparent decal, which means this is not going to render at all. But we can fix it. Looks nice. I think one change I'm going to make is just remove this. Just because I think people would want to jump through this. And it makes camera a little bit easier to work with. I think the name was Iris Rosano. SunnyDy3F. Is that a bunch of midi code? Yeah, I know. I think I'm going to make this just slightly see-through. Just to give people an easier time here. Actually, we could do a different combiner. One where you can see individual pixels. I have a cool idea for this. Oh, you're right. The middle is not a transparent decal. I was just wrong. Cool. Did he say something in games? Yes, tons. Yeah, this seems like a sound level. Not many issues here. No, I was thinking we're using a cut-out decal. So cut-out decals are similar. But instead of transparency, they only have 0 or 1 on the alpha. So that way you can paint the vertex alpha. To make them thin. Okay, before I do anything on the level itself. I think I want to put a hole in the level. Or in the overworld. Then you can go in to enter the level. I don't actually have a creative idea for how to enter the side level. So I'm just going to leave it as it is. We need to brainstorm two things. Shit, I forgot about this. It's a good thing we're still on the last overworld stream. Because there's one more overworld thing I wanted to do. So one thing I've seen people bring up consistently. Is the fact that you can't enter the side level. You can't enter the side level. You can't enter the side level. You can't enter the side level. They want Poochie to do something in the overworld. Something with a star. Because right now you can hop onto Poochie. And he's going to lead you to coins. After some time. And that's all he does. The question is, can we make him give you a star somehow. And then the second question is. How do we make the side level entrance work. You sound fucking precious when you smile. You can't do that. I didn't see your post. I think Twitch censored it. So I can't read it. Will I be able to switch to the original camera sound and release? Nope. Enjoy. Yes, my game fits on a 64MB cartridge, but I cannot print them, because that would literally be illegal. Let PewDiePie decapitate your world. I mean yes, that would be the most obvious thing, but how? There's already a star where you use them being invulnerable. Maybe an enemy is going to trust you towards the tree like a Chuckster. No, it would just have to be Poochie himself. I don't know, maybe at some point you could start digging and not stumble on. Next time you come back you stack a massive order and it's too simple. Let me check the list of levels. I mean we already have one underground level. The one with the bombs. This one already has a spot. I guess the Conspiracy Theory Yoshi House could be dug up by him. If you just kept digging and then found like a pipe that leads to the Conspiracy Theory Yoshi's house, I think that would be very funny. Or you could dig up a spot of light that brings you there. Hello Zayna, we are currently brainstorming what to do with Poochie in the overworld. If we want him to do more than just give points. And Tim being a side level entrance, I kind of like it. Although there is a question of how would a player ever think to just stand on Poochie again, after he's gotten just points from it once. I guess the old Master Yoshi would tell you. Look at these cool leaves by the way. I think we can do that. I think we should do that. Mr. Shy Guy level. A long rolling jump. And one Poochie. That's what we do. That's a good solution for both of them, because then we can just put... What's your name? Polish Aragorn, Iris Fasana, Sunny... How do you want to be called? I never know what to call you. You have to make up your minds. Otherwise I will just choose one for you. I don't know. How do you expect them to work after the overworld? Uh, side levels. Iris Farina? Oh right, that's the name. I went to a fish store yesterday, for fun. And I asked the person working there a question. And they fucking typed it into ChenGBT and then just told me what ChenGBT told them. I'm not going there again. I'm not even a ChenGBT hater or anything. But the fact that the person thought ChenGBT is just going to give me reliable information that I should relay to the customer. It's like, holy shit dude. Fine, use it if you want, but at least have a little bit of a brain. Got summoned today? Nice. You missed that? She just typed the question into ChenGBT. Can ChenGBT optimize for the N64? Yeah, very poorly though. And most of the time it's just going to give you code that breaks your game. AI is the future. AI is the future. Unfortunately it is. And people are not ready to deal with it. Technology is evolving faster than people evolved to cope with it. Which is an issue. I do miss them. Wait, it's here twice. Unused garbage file, cool. Double Shy Guy Seek entry undeclared. Okay, we need to make that now. Hate to say it, but I will probably have to just remake the whole level here. Arch Linux? As in, I will have to remake the order, not the level. It looks like you modeled on Scale 100. I don't think so. How long does my code take to compile? Like 32 seconds? Can't wait for the eye bubble to burst. It's not going to. I don't think so. People have been saying this forever. But I think they're saying it because they want it to be true and not because they actually believe it. Oh, this is a little ugly that this is the same texture. Or it might just look like this in Fast64 review. It might not actually be like this in-game. I don't think so. Mod items. Let's rock. Entry entry. Decal will have to be Severed Snow Footsteps. Oh, that's cool. I like this a lot. Oh, the decal underwater? Don't worry, that's just a Mario 64 bug. That bug doesn't exist in my engine. Oh, I see how this works now. Yeah, I think it's going to be easier for me to just do that. Oop. Assuming the entrance is supposed to be here. Oh. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. You faded the tree out like that. I was thinking of fading out this part here. I think I'm going to do that. Not because I hate your tree or anything, but because that kinda has to be there with the level that this is under. I'll also never use environment color. That would break things. This is fine. Yeah, environment color is just wrong. It would just show up black again. It only worked on R64 because it's doing some degenerate things. Duplicate this. Oh, did I forget to apply? I'll change this. Wait, what? Oh. There we go. I assume you would use some color to make waves. Yep, that's fair. 6000 triangles, that should be fine. Tutorial 1. Tutorial 2. Let's see if that works. No collision data to export, but that's perfectly fine. I guess we might as well remove the unnecessary collision here. Tutorial 3. Ace, why are you removing detail? You worked so hard on this level, and you just go and remove all its detail? Tutorial 4. Tutorial 5. Tutorial 6. Tutorial 7. Tutorial 8. Tutorial 9. Tutorial 10. Tutorial 11. Tutorial 12. Tutorial 13. Tutorial 14. Tutorial 15. Oh, this is a bit weird. This is a bit weird. That's a little unclean, I guess. There are a couple more triangles here that it needs. Same here. That's mildly concerning. I should have taken a look at that before I took the collision ramp. Shit. Well, at least the collision is down to 3000 per minute now. Well, I am hoping that Biobank doesn't have to rework all the guest levels. But he might. Hopefully he can just do a quick ass-over. It's been an oop. Don't really care. Doesn't really make a difference. No shine gates here? Okay, well. I think that's a sign that has to go. And I don't like that you don't use... Oh, well, you probably do use empty cubes. They're just so small compared to how big I scaled the level. Yep, this should work. Is the game done? It's done when it's done, brah. Let me work. It is just for collision. I did not actually remove any detail. But whenever I do collision, people complain that I'm removing detail. That's why I'm making a joke. You can even call it a joke. All right, let's see if we can look at the level. I don't think C++ or Rust SSR to C, neither. They're both full of random shit. Any programming language that has references implemented the way C++ has them cannot be SSR to C. They just don't get it. Did I just type Shigeru Seiken? No, I didn't. What? Did I do this in the overworld? What the fuck? What's so bad about being done in the overworld? What? These are problems. Oh, service noise default is not defined. I don't know why. Why? Take control. Yeah, working under the collision node. I don't know what blend node. Yeah, exactly. You are correct that I was not actually removing detail. Wait, one more compile error. Wait, what? Oh. We don't have skyboxes anymore. It's actually more exciting than C. You think it's more readable. Yeah. It's actually more exciting than C. You think it's more readable. Sure. You think it's more readable, I believe you. Hey guys. Wait. How did this even go? Wait. Something, something. I go to a Chinese restaurant and I just think it's a restaurant. Just a peek into how Chinese my mind has gotten. Okay. Okay. Stop music. How did you generate a stop music comment? What the fuck? Wait, does this level use fog? I don't think it does. Okay. Where's the music? What? Oh, disabled music. That's weird that there's a disabled music thing. Hashmaps? Hashmaps? You can program Hashmaps in C. You want Hashmaps to be part of the language? What? What? That's not the purpose of a language at all. Having Hashmaps as part of your programming language is kind of like having the sentence I pooped my pants and then went to class just be one word in your normal language. Imagine there was a word in the English language that just meant I pooped my pants and then went to class. Here's what I... I blimboed, and that means you pooped your pants and then went to class. You know what I'm putting down? It did not say last stream. It said last Overwatch stream. Why is it the last Overwatch stream? It should just be custom Overwatch. What the hell am I doing? Yeah, and then there's no other word that has such long meaning in the entire language. It's true. I think it's an anecdote, right? Do you agree? Well, you understand the principle. Hey, there we go! Levels here! Scale looks to be correct as well. I think it looks mostly nice. One thing I will complain about a little bit is these grass edges. I think they could have a nicer texture. So they're probably changing that. Maybe the color of the bridge. The white outline on the rocks here. Some of the logs. But yeah, overall it's great. I already made PvE armor toons on the N64. I'm way late with your question. You know, when I see a section like this I'm worried it's too difficult for you noobs. But it might be fine. You can't make a noob only game, I know! What's going on in the background? Party party? What? Wait, what? What happened there? Am I insane? Did it just fade out somehow? I'm insane. Okay, nevermind. Yeah, I noticed the scene. Yeah. This is probably fine to exist. Yeah. Any M&M haters in chat? Anyone wanna eat M&M with me? What? What the fuck are you talking about? Why are you giving me homework? Fuck. What is going on? Oh, because you're using environment color! Ah, that's why. That's why it's fading out. Yeah, don't touch environment color. Primitive color only. I had to disable environment color because of the first 64 bug. I don't have any programming animals. I'm glad you like this. This one was made by Iris Varimba. This one specifically here. Primitive and environment are the same on an N64 level. But on the fast 64 level, primitive is fucked up. Sorry, environment. I mean environment. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, environment is fucked up and primitive is fine. Is this a shortcut? Shortcut? No, I don't go on StackOverflow. StackOverflow is just a Redditor version of Reddit. I'm glad it's dying. One good thing AI did, kill StackOverflow. So let's see. Where are the intended locations to be? Okay. Clearly not there. Okay. Something must have gone wrong here. What the fuck am I listening to? I must have fucked up something here. I must have fucked up something here. Hello baby Brushy. In JavaScript, never used it. What? I think smoking weed is giga cringe. Let me just download the thing again. Baby Brushy just DM'd me. Like this, he said. And then he sent this. Yes, that's so cool Yoshi. Elon Musk brags about doing it, so it is cringe. That's sound logic. That would however also mean that playing Diablo is cringe. Sorry, I couldn't think of a better example. I'm just saying, if everything Elon Musk does is cringe, then getting rejected from visiting Epstein Island is also cringe. There we go, bad example. Okay, Staghorn was useless before AI, we only went there to find out how useless it was. The answer to every question was how useless Staghorn was. That is very cringe, that's true actually. Imagine you're the richest man in the world and you wanna go to the rich pedophile convention and they're like, you're not cool enough, even though you're the richest guy there. Kinda crazy. You like Yoshi's Island? Good, me too. So here's one location planned. Oh, and then... I like this one. One in the bush here. One in the house here. And then one hiding under a mushroom. I'm a little blind, one second. Did I delete the mushroom? No. Okay. Have I worked in IT? I'm an ex-Broadway runner or something? No. Do you know about shift over first game? I do. I do. One thing that I think I want to maybe change a little bit about this demo is how compressed it is. I think I want it to be more compressed. Um... Like, have there be less of a play area, maybe? Oh, but I'm actually not sure. Maybe this is good. Let me get more revive for this area. LSE Arc. What are we after overworld? Side levels. Hello, Momfu. I went to the wrong level. Oops. I am watching Naked. Congratulations. Thank you for watching Naked. I imagine it's cold, man. It's winter and you're watching Naked. Is there any scale at 90% here, which is nice? Oh, I see. Did I make it smaller? Or did you make it smaller before sending it to me? Like, it'd be cool if you could get up here. I mean, you can. What's my code? It's a small amount of code you upload to the RSP. Like, I'm sure people can do this jump, but at the same time, it's a little weird that you'd have to jump on the mushroom first. I think if we do that, we have to make the mushroom stalk more intentional. So that's what we should do. Make the mushrooms flatter and bigger. Either that or something else. Gotcha, gotcha. It doesn't say last stream. Read the title again. I think I'm gonna change the mushrooms just a little bit to make this feel more intentional if you skip up here and stuff like that. It's not about whether the mushroom looks good or bad, it's about whether the platforming feels intentional. Holy fuck, why is it lagging so much all of a sudden? I don't know. I did two of these mushrooms in one spot. Am I crazy? I am aware that I'll have to copy this again for later. But I'll also have to make the level look a bit more like the rest of the game as well, from another romhack. I see what you mean, yes. I didn't make the trauma obvious, what? Oh, I see. See, it's that old law of no matter how much you try to make yourself sound like a parody, you're always gonna sound like someone who's really stupid. I don't know. What kind of tech should I be using here? Oh, so I don't want to write the N64 BIOS to get more extra FPS. I, um, no, I doubt it. I don't even think it, I mean it has like some code built into it. Is that what a BIOS is? Not really, no programming words, just no programming. Yeah, I see. That's what this is doing. Did you rip these textures from Microsoft? It's funny if true. The reason I am changing the combiner like this is because of an RDP bug, by the way. Why does this level look so different and blended to me than in-game? I personally don't run into that issue. I just write down what I want to do when and then I just do it. I think the big difference in how this would look like in RTYI or in my art style is that I probably have like a harsher gradient here, usually. Oh, I see, it's not really possible because of this other texture. So we should look at this texture here first. Why would there be scenes on this texture? I'm not sure I understand fully. Why is this last? Because I thought I'd be done with the overworld. I don't even know which game it is, it's just bouncing everywhere. That's true, that's a texture that you see in many remakes. Let's save this in the RTYI folder. I'm pretty sure we want to go forward with this level. Yeah, this is definitely a safe way to remove the things, the borders. The question is, do we really want that? If we want to go with the RTYI art style, I think it'd be more sensible to only have the picture borders at the bottom. Because that's what we usually do. I'm not sure honestly. I'm here at the stream. Oh, speaking facts. Kim Gio, is he a Yu-Gi-Oh! player? I like Yu-Gi-Oh! Yu-Gi-Oh! is a banger. Are you linking my favorite textures together? Combiner. Watch my newest video, it shows it. Another thing in the middle, the big tree. Well, the point of this is that this is at the bottom of the big tree, for just a bonus star. How do you come into my stream and ask me a question that I answered in a video I uploaded not even 3 hours ago? That's kind of offensive. You're just coming in here and telling me you don't watch my video. Unbelievable. And at the same breath, you ask for advice. Really? What if we went with something like this instead? I think this could look a little nicer. How is there an area at the bottom of the big tree if you can go there? This sentence does not compute. Can't figure out the intention. How does being able to go there prevent it from existing? Anyway, this is the big tree. These things are awful, I need to reorder them. Some seams at the end of decal grass that we will need to remove. Not sure I fully understand. I'm also not sure what this is. What is all this stuff? Can this just go? Is this for Verdict's Palace? Looks like it's for Verdict's Palace. I guess that's fine. I'm either having a stroke right now, or... Is the big tree in the overworld? If it's in the overworld, why is the base in a different area? It is not, no. It is visible from the overworld, but you can't go to the big tree in the overworld. I'm not sure what this is. Looks better, but there are seams at the ends of decal grass that are meant to vanish with alpha. Seams at the end of decal grass. Do you know where this would be? Are those leaves on the top of the tree? It's going to save a lot of triangles, though. It's going to save a lot of triangles, though. Do you mean, like, the seams on the side here? Yeah, they don't matter. These are fine. They're not real seams, I guess, is what I would say. Hello. Hello. Hello. No, by the way, I explicitly had them... Wait, are you asking me? Yes, I think you're fine to edit this again, if it doesn't take too long. But any guest contributor for RTY, I let them know beforehand that I might have to edit their level after they're done with it, just to make it fit in. And obviously that would be gameplay testing, and in gameplay testing you always find issues you fix. There's no way I would ever accept a level and, like, be unable to edit it afterwards. Just because during gameplay testing I would find many flaws. Right, there's also a second way to pronounce the Z. Z is, like, such a low tier letter. Oh, what the hell? That's weird, right? I think I know why you did it. But I'm probably going to just... ...kill this part. I know I've changed the colour slightly, but I'm going to fix it later. Why is your blender so laggy? It just happens sometimes. I've gotten to just accept it. Or are you just flexing your PC on me right now? In which case, fuck you. Why was your math grade in school so bad? I don't know if it was bad. Why is your bench press so low? I don't know. I don't know. Why are you actually flexing your PC? Or are you saying that this is unusual? I'm actually not sure. I think I made it all better. Shit. You're saying that maybe there's a way to fix it? That would be crazy. Yeah, my PC sucks. It's honestly a tragedy that I'm working on this PC and not something better, given how I actually kind of need a good PC for my actual job. Okay, I see. So these are different. And I think I should just give these their old texture back. Oh yeah, that looks kind of sweet. Yeah, I really should. I really should just jump a bunch of money on a new PC. But then I have to set up everything again, I have to set up the decomputation again. Minor optimization lesson, always enable coloring, even on things that will never be colored. Because when I'm looking like this, all the triangles behind the camera, they're going to be quit early without being drawn, which is a huge perf boost. This is very hard drive, that works! No way, right? I'm slightly editing the colors. Oh, this one seems like a sensitive one. What is happening here? There are some duplicate triangles here. That's better. Yeah, I think a little bit more contrast on the colors makes this look a little better. I probably need to get the sides to be darker, honestly. Let me try something. That's maybe too dark, but I think the idea could work. Yeah, I kinda like this. I'm eventually getting all the fighting textures and broken seams, possibly. Oh, you have vertex groups. Oh. Interesting. Let's see if I can make that work. I remember I had the setup you have here, too, in one level, but then I got lazy on using it, and then I stopped. Yeah, it was a little bit more than just the grass. And yeah, it looks like you also got lazy with it after a while. Fair enough. It's fine, we can fix it from here. Let me just make this a white scale decal here. Yeah. There we go. The hell? There we go. Why are there no transparent pixels on here? Okay. Yeah, that's how I want it. Okay, there we go. Okay. He's seeing the vision? What do you think? Okay. Now you can actually kinda look through it. True, Biomech. Okay. I kinda fixed those colors, but that's fine. I saw environment color on the flower. It's all environment color, isn't it? They all use environment color. They all do. Oh, this one doesn't. This one does. That's gonna be quite a bit of work to fix. This one should have background color disabled. Okay. Alright, now it looks more like an RTYI level, doesn't it? The vertex kinda changed like this so much to make it look like an RTYI level. This isn't a bridge. Yeah, the bridge is kinda clipping into it. Not 100% on the bridge yet either. We'll think about it. The log probably just needs a bit of a color change. The mushrooms probably need a few more vertices. But we can work with this. I think the biggest visual change that we're going to see is from vertex colors on the walls here. And some UV mapping fixes. Maybe the logs. Overall, that seems solid. It's casecore true. I never really thought about it, but I guess these types of vertex colors are a little casecore. Yeah, I'm starting to like this. I think this will turn out awesome. We just need to put the Shy Guys. I think the size of the level is perfect. I think the level design actually works really well. Just those small changes to make the jumps more intentional is all we needed. This one I feel like could be a bit of an issue. Because what if you're a bad player and you fall down here? It sucks being here. This place sucks because of the camera. Yeah, the mushrooms just need more vertices. I have worked a little bit with LibDragon. Unfortunately, LibDragon performs much, much worse than LibUltra at the moment. So I'm definitely using LibUltra for this one. Well, I'm using my own spin on LibUltra. I'm modifying LibUltra. I'm basically removing LibUltra. Don't be a bad player. Why didn't I think of telling the players to just not be bad? I don't know. I need to click this button. Yeah. I mean, you did try a lot harder with this level, didn't you? You added way more stuff here. But it looks good. I don't know if I'm stupid for worrying about this jump. Because what if someone misses this and now they have to go back all the way to the top? Maybe put a sign in the game to just not be bad? Yeah, sure. I think we need one big landing platform here. I think that's the one more level design change I'll make. You have to remember, the audience I'm designing games for is a lot worse than your average ROM pick players. Oh, that's nice. That's a really fast improvement, Sonny. Took me a while to get to a level where I would be able to model something like this. Yeah, I think now any type of skilled player will be able to jump here. I think that's all we'll do for today. Next stream we will probably finish this level or another side level if I haven't finished this one off-stream already. If you're unlucky we will have to go back to the overworld because I'll realize that there's something else I need to do. Alright, I will see you guys in the next stream. Until then, bye bye!
