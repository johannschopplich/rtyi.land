Hello. Anybody here today.  Just making sure everything's all right. Can anybody see me right now? I'm live on Twitch. And YouTube. Hello, Refusion. You're the first chat I hear. Hello, Osef. Thank you, thank you. The dark knight can wait. Hello, Gspin. Welcome to the stream. Thank you. Do we have any OST wishes for today? By the way, later on we're going to live react to F3. Because F3 is happening during the stream. Hello, Trankton. Hello, Trankton. Are you the presenter for F3? Yes, I am. As usual. Why not? Especially when SimbaFlips was presenting. People were like, this feels like an in joke. Which is fair. SimbaFlips does have that vibe about him sometimes. Yeah, Nathaniel is a good host, too. His editor is still helping with F3. Okay, I think my YouTube stream backed out again. Cool, cool. Hello, Seymour. Hello, DJAveragePenis. That's it. Welcome to all the YouTube viewers. I'm going to run on rails. Your hacks are amazing. Thank you. I'm especially so happy with oilyboilybay. Hello, Profile. Yes, the baby came out five days ago. Mama Yoshi in the house. Exactly.  Here's the game running on N64. Isn't that cool? I love that I can just turn on the N64 so quickly nowadays. And look at the framerate. It's decent. This is what the N64 games could have looked like. You were robbed. With all these options, too. When you want anti-aliasing, there you go. Now the game is anti-aliased. Over the last week or so, I did a lot of bug fixing here. And I found so many small improvements doing that, too. Minuscule performance tweaks. And I'm very happy with it. I almost finished my to-do list regarding bugs and performance issues. Oh, nice, Zeina. Yes, platformer, I'm a father now. I wonder if this pipe works now. There's a pipe here that never worked on N64. But I did a bug fix recently. That means it might work again. It works! Oh my god, I got Giga killed. Hello, Lilaa. Oh, this is a bug, too. But it looks like it mostly works. The timer is going way too fast. Wait a second. That was not seconds. I don't know how it runs on a N64 PAL. Probably... I mean, on unlimited FPS, you might get the same. You might have it run fine, I think. But I'm not sure. Let's look at the performance of this area now. This is with anti-aliasing on. 46. 45 to 46. She did really well. It changed the FPS position. It's because I switched to Sauraen's profile, Lilaa. Everything is a little different now. What OST do we listen to today? How about Star Fox 64? Oh, right. That sounds like this. That's such a famous song. Hello, Lucas. Will I be able to run this on Android Move in 64 Plus? Oh, probably. If the emulator is any decent. Lucas the Pucas. Insane naming. Insane. Fastest 3D model you've ever seen? I mean, I'm decently fast. Really, I'm limited by how quickly I can come up with good ideas for what I want to do. And not by how quickly I can do the things. Is this any decent? It should be fine. It's like an overall kick section. Let me give this a try. Thank you. Yes. F3 is going to be in 50 minutes, guys. We're going to live stream this.     We're going to live react to it on stream. So get your congrats out while you can. Because after that, it's F3 time. Other than this one, what's your favorite mod you've created? Maybe Peach's Fury? I think that one's pretty good. So the idea here is after the slide you get here. And now you are on the snowman path. And you're going to dodge these guys. This seems kind of difficult, to be honest. These ones should probably be a little more parallel to each other. Because the wall kicks are otherwise a bit awkward. And then this jump. I'm not sure if I like this jump either. It's not a difficult jump, but it's a little awkward. What do you think? The thing Cowcrack has been asking for two months ago? What could it be? Blender previewing or something? This was not done on the N64 console. But I could test this on the N64 console if I wanted to right away. All I have to do to test this on the N64 is hit this button here. Open my capture card program. Then I turn on my N64. Hello Zero Vault. And now we are on the real N64. It's as shrimpless as that. When I play on N64, I have a shit ton of delay. And oh god, camera issues. Not too surprising, to be honest. And yeah, because the frame buffer doesn't get cleared. Of course it's going to look like that. I think this level is a little too big and that's why the camera does this. It usually does that when you have a really big area. I might have to invent a solution to that problem. Right now I'm not really worrying about it. I'm going to give the player a little bit of a longer walk up. So that they feel comfortable triple jumping over here. More excited for ROM hack lately than actual game releases? Yeah. The thing is... All the franchises that you like that are really popular. The games that they make for those have to sell well. And ROM hack don't have to sell well. So ROM hack can get a little more creative. Because when you have to sell well, you have to make something somewhat bland. I think maybe that is why you are looking forward to ROM hack a little more. And I think that's fair. The hat is not stretched when the game is 16 to 9? It's possible. But we would need unstretched elements for that to look good. And I don't have those. CVN LF3? Yeah, I don't understand that. That's lame. Maybe I want to offer a promotion of your channel. Oh no, it's a bot. Cringe. Oh, by the way. I have a guy editing my last video. I want to hear you guys' thoughts on this. If I can find it. Where is this video? It's really clean and I like it a lot. Well, if you want stuff that is not bland, maybe I can offer you a promotion. Just don't look at mainstream stuff, right? You can still find that stuff. How can I not find this video? I know I downloaded it. Well, that's too bad. I guess I can't show you. But it looks sleek and you guys will like it a lot. It's a video about render matrices. Considering that this is too difficult. Let's make it easier. Also, let's bring everything in a little bit. So that the camera issue doesn't pop up. Let's see. I'm going to watch Godzilla minus one. I don't know what that is. Let's see. See, what I have to do with my reviews is I have to hide them under actual technical videos. So that you can see the level. And you see that there's progress. But also you have a reason to watch the video. Because when I make your previews, people don't want to watch those. They want to just watch the technical stuff. Because, you know, I guess no one wants to get spoiled. But at the same time, I have to let people know that I'm still making progress on the hack. Otherwise, people are going to be disgruntled. So whenever I make a preview, it's like Look how I used this new feature on the N64 to make this level. Works well enough. And it's not dishonest marketing either. That is honestly what I do. A teaser of my game in F3? No, my game never will show up in F3. No, no, F3 is going to be live on stream. There's gonna be a premiere on my main channel in 40 minutes, we have 235 people waiting there right now and then I'm gonna just pull up the premiere and we're gonna watch it in full screen and you're gonna have the option to either watch it without my face in the bottom right corner on my main channel or with my face on the bottom right corner on this channel. It's the Germany ice. Okay, that's a lot easier now, perfect. Did I see a missing shadow there? Why do these snowmen not have shadows? Sus. He has a shadow, he doesn't. Hello Xenoc. Wait, I've said hello to you already. In my opinion, the black background is really fitting, I actually want to keep the black background here as a comment, so careful what you're saying. Okay, that's high enough for the deathground and then we can just go under here. You are Lilaang, I know, I am Kanki. My child is named Reyna. She is currently upstairs with Zeina's mom. That's some Naruto bull roto shit, it is. I can't even deny it. How was it and how tired are you? What do you mean how was it? Making the kit was very fun and I'm not that tired. Is it a boy or a girl? It's a girl. It's a girl. That wasn't even a joke, that's what he asked. I'm standing in the middle of a hallway and she sees me approaching and she doesn't move to the side. She just stands there and looks at me. You poor fucking Martian. This game is looking like an epic game, what do you mean? I'm basically Gandhi. Whatever you think. Wow, this guy doesn't think I'm basically Gandhi. How is this possible? I guess that makes sense. Is man perhaps charming and fun to be around but empathetic? No. What? Can you believe this guy? I have a heart of plastic. You look like Susuta Mikotaba. Search it if you want. I will not search it because I do not want to. But thank you or fuck you depending on whether it looks good or bad. Hello, Avahi Smash. Hello, Voltershock. You look like Sonic Inflation Rule 34. Search it. True. Hello, Haskinator. Thank you, Bardino. Thank you, Bardino. Thank you, Bardino. Omg, I see it. Me too, Lilaa. Thank you. This? I look like an anime girl? 5 foot 153 centimeters? Yeah, I don't think so. What do you think I am? Cheese pin? I'm gonna make sure the faces are facing the right way. Just make them face the right way. Dude, don't add cheese pin. We can't let them know that he's catching strays. I'm not shorter than you, Lilaa. Okay, I think just one more platform and then we just move on to the next room. The last room I want to look like this and then behind it I want there to be a huge treasure room. Okay, let's go. BG Suit! Yo, it's been so long, dude. I gotta show you what we're working on, BG Suit. You haven't been here in how long? What was the last course you've been active in? You haven't even seen how high quality this game is now. I mean, let me show you this with music. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you see this shit? Yes, somehow I'm more proud of this than of the child. What can I say? I'm an artist. Do you know the fuzzies? You remember the fuzzies from Lost Impact? These are a little better. This was Biobak's idea and Biobak made the model. They're now wearing protective gear. And dude, I mean, it's so cool when you like go downstairs. The music. I love that the music does that. Dude, I love this level so much. Nintendo CC my live streams. Yeah, they're crying. We also got a Bowser office here. But the Bowser office is missing the song right now. But we have a song. We have a song for the Bowser office and the Bowser elevator now. And they're both great. Dude, it's not just the colors. You see the lights here? Look at that. And this is what our cross one looks like by now. Oh, never mind. There's a bug and I can't untype. Increase game sound? You're fine. Mario 64 Mega is 99 terabytes. Nope, it's going to be under 64 megabytes. There we go. This is what Bunny Brush looks like by now. Probably very different from when you last saw it. We got Unreal Engine in here. This level has infinite drawing distance even on 64. No, by the way. It's still at 60 FPS sometimes. All right. Enough of showing this to BG Suit. Back to 3D modeling. Hello, Rainy. Yep, infinite render distance on N64 in this level. Oh, this is also a new thing. I can show you guys how the Romic looks on N64. Basically, whenever I just click that one button and I turn my N64. This is N64 controller. There we go. We're good to go. Let me turn on my FPS display. This is the Cowboy level. But that's not what we wanted to look at. I wanted to show you guys the infinite render distance real quick. Yeah, you see the bunnies all the way in the background here? Yeah, you can see them. Oh, you don't like how the game looks? Too blurry? It's fine. Turn on anti-aliasing. Well, now it looks more blurry, but you get it. We have anti-aliasing now. Oh, those Goombas popped in. That's fine. I can fix it. Doesn't cost anything extra. As soon as someone exported level from Mario Builder, they're gonna put a music which actually makes level editing easier. Okay, well, I mean, why don't you just make it in Mario 64 right away instead of going from Mario Builder? That would be the easiest, wouldn't it? How do you farm making SM64 musics? You can use any program for composing. Anything that you would make normal music in, I think. Ideally, you would export it as a MIDI, though. But that's not even required. If you want, you can import your songs directly as MP3s. Or, well, WAVs. How come you were gone for so long, BG-Suit? Life got in the way? Just had different interests for a bit. Just curious. They don't cost a pretty penny if you pirate them, which I would never encourage, by the way. I think piracy is theft, and it's rightfully illegal. Because I'm a good person. ADPCM, that's the format officially called. I still hope that one day OPPO's compression or whatever the LibDragon people are cooking up is good enough that we can just put a whole hex OSD on it. So you said you were switching to YouTube, and I assume you died for a bit? Yeah, there was a very big drop in viewers when I switched to YouTube. And I attributed it mostly to people just not wanting to watch streams on YouTube. But I guess it also makes sense that a lot of people just didn't know I switched to YouTube. I believe here that OPPO's compression is decent, but I'm not sure it's better than just MP3 imports. I guess there's a use case for everything. My problem with OPPO's is that I can't put my entire hex on it. Even OPPO's compressed songs would be too big to put the entire OSD on. So media is just kind of a better option right now. Did my daughter already born? Yes, she did. She did the born. So this next room is going to look like this. Is it a girl? Should I make a gender reveal runback? Zephyr in my 6th rank, it better be Return to the Oasis Island Vance out, otherwise I might have to disown her. I'm sorry Zeina. Do you think our daughter will be able to play Super Mario Star World? Hello Wimps, what's going on? We are 3D modeling. Everyone was always talking about how having a child is so much work. And sure, it's a bit of work, but currently Zeina's mom is helping us and honestly, it doesn't feel like that much, although it's probably a lot more work for Zeina than for me. Do you plan to put the game when it's finished on real cartridge? Okay, the thing is, I am not allowed to sell real cartridges, so I can't do that. But what I am planning to do is make a box and a book inlet without any Nintendo references to it and put that out so you can at least get the box as a souvenir. And I'm sure there will be illegally manufactured cartridges by other people. So you would still get a complete Return to Yoshi's Island set if you really, really want to, but it would be pretty expensive. That is also my biggest worry, Nina, I want nothing to do with poop. I know, Lila. I'm going to summarize our mod right now. Thanks for making the game so awesome. I enjoy it. My experience as an artist. I noticed a lot of levels you post have great designs. The colors in particular on the old sea level breathtaking is the experience just from games. I learned a lot of stuff and well, first of all, I'm surprised to hear that you think it's that great. Maybe you like Biobak's part more than mine. For color palettes, the one I made for Oily Boily Bay, I kind of just made it up out of thin air. I have a little bit of a weird approach to art. Not that I'm a great artist or anything, I'm just like average, I think, and I have a very different approach, which maybe that's why my stuff stands out a little bit. Usually when you learn art, there's a lot of principles you learn and you learn principles for the sake of principles and then critics also just learn the principles and they look at the principles and they think how well did this person apply the principles and that's how I'm going to judge the art. I think that's a really, really poor approach and a very dateable approach as in your thing will be outdated very quickly. I think a better way is you think about what feeling do I want to create and then you look at your tools and you look at how you can use your tools to create that feeling. You don't want to operate on principles because if you operate on principles, you make art for critics, you don't make art for the sake of it being experienced. I'm still working on that video about how being humble is stupid, but that wouldn't be anything I work on. That's just, that would just be a thing I would say, you know, it would just be a rant and yes, I do want to upload that rant one day. I just haven't felt like doing it yet. You know, probably not looking at the entire thing and looking at how holistic it works and looks in the environment. That's a lot more specific than what I was saying, but yes. Are you even modeling right now? This, I want it to look like this. Just don't get it, Lina, it's okay. I will get it soon, one day she will learn. It's really stupid to me as how we tend to praise schools that teach to look at principles more than what the environment is supposed to do. I mean, school just teaches principles, right? Especially when you like do an essay. Will Zeina ever be in the streams again? She's always in chat. Maybe if you ask her nicely, she can come in for a second. I mean, you just donated 5 bucks, surely Zeina can come in and say hi for that. But I hear her run around the house, so she probably won't know. I'm sure Zeina is going to show up at least a few times again. At least 10 dollars for the Zeina cameo. I'll reach Shardwick for that. Can you put Luigi in your room and make him think of a character just for fun? I can, but I might not. I don't know yet. I have to see how much room there would be at the end and how much room space there would be left. Making multiplayer mode in Mario 64 is actually really easy. It doesn't take that much work. Guys, I have a video idea, by the way. I think this one could go hard. What if I made a video titled How Nintendo's optimizations in Mario 64 made the game run worse. And then I talk about all the optimizations they did that actually were not optimizations. That actually made the game run slower. Would you guys be interested in that? Having a video idea? I think so, too. There is a few things Nintendo did that actually made the game run worse. When I first see you play Mario 64, what do you think of it? I was like 6 or 7 and I played it at my cousin's house. I thought it was very interesting. Did I enter the wrong level? I did. 10 million views? I don't think 10 million, but I think quite a few. 1k zillion views? Yep, yep. Definitely a kazillion. You can just go here if you think that jump is too difficult. Okay, the treasure room is way too small and this room is also way too small.  What is this? Why do you have the country of Germany in your eyes? It's an accident. New level, this is course 13. We're already pretty far into it. I hope I can finish this level in the next month or so and then it's just two levels missing. Guys, can you imagine? I would never become patriotic. I hate Germany. And then this is going to be a room full of treasure. Money and stuff. Is Germany having a whole political thing again? The right-wing party is gaining a lot of traction now. But that's kind of global, isn't it? I don't know.    Germany, what do you need the most? The bureaucracy. Now, is this going to be Frostbite Fortress or something? I don't know if I like Fortress. Rush, Mace... Minty... I think next year F3 I'm going to announce it on my main channel. Just so we can get even more people. Icy Fortress, that's a lame name. He did actually do that though, didn't he? He just disagreed over who's accumulating the capital. Can you add frozen plant trees to the ice level? I can. I don't know if I want to. What's with this level currently? This is supposed to be a somewhat surreal, very icy castle. Hello, Dana. Hello, Maui. She left that one script Mario Galaxy boss. Who's that? I'm not up to date with the Mario Galaxy lore here. Dude, I had a comment earlier that was like, wow, okay, it's a real smart idea to put all the fan games together so Nintendo has a CND list. I hate those comments. You get them every time anyone advertises any mod. And that's just not how it works. Imagine we make F3 for five years and we don't get a single CND and then suddenly it's a huge problem. I think I know exactly where this problem originated from. There was this one YouTuber that said if you're making a fan game, just shut the fuck up about it. It's all his fault. If you make a fan game and you shut up about it and you don't show anyone, you CND'd yourself. Why are you doing Nintendo's job for them? Also, you won't get CND'd most likely unless your game gets really, really popular. So you can release it in full. Who's stopping you from releasing it in full anyway? Could just be an anonymous leak on 4chan. Which is what happened with the Mario 64 Deco project. Only three minutes left? Yep, I can't miss F3. Wait months to get some forms to follow which you give to them a month later and then wait months more? Yep, it's awful. Bro, ice balls in Mario Galaxy? You mean the ice flower? Eh? Man, that move is not almighty. Okay yeah, this is gonna look beautiful once it's done. You also can't go back to the main level from here, which is fine because there's no 100 coin stars. What do you think of Mario 64 Gameplay? Most people say it's age-pretty-bully and it was good at the time. I think it's decent. There's just places where it fights you too much. The thing with the Mario 64 camera that most people don't understand is that in Mario 64 you control Mario and Lakitu at the same time. You can't just expect the camera to do the work for you. You actually have to be like both players. Alright guys, we will have to watch F3 today. Which is about to start. Okay, well I guess there's still a countdown waiting. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to wash your hands after going to the bathroom. True. Oh, 2 minute timer. Thank you, YouTube Okay Let's check this section from start to finish and Make sure it's all fun to play while the countdown is going we have one and a half minutes left So let's use those one and a half minutes wisely You Over 500 viewers on the life 605 people waiting. That's very good. We like to see those numbers We have one minute left can I beat the slide in one minute I Mean I'm gay baby jails cool. Okay, we have 40 seconds 30 seconds remain I Okay, we're not doing it 15 seconds remain Ten nine eight, okay. I'm pulling over You Welcome back to another f3 this year We'll be looking at around 40 minutes of trailers from the newest fan games that have either released within the last 12 months Or are going to be releasing within the next 12 months All of these games are a hundred percent free to play and hopefully also a hundred percent fun to play Out of all the trailers that have been submitted this year I've made sure to pick a set of interesting and diverse trailers to make sure everyone finds at least one game that they will like to Oh shit, I'm sorry It's Pokemon time I like deliberation Did I think these are really cool start a Pokemon I Think this one actually looks interesting. I'm not into Pokemon fan games, but this one could be good I Right, this is the next Pokemon trailer divine one one It's very much just based on memes and Yes, that was finger I stick up the back of the Pokemon. It's just a bunch of reference to online stuff, right? It looks like people anticipated this a lot a lot of people know about vine man, it's pretty cool Out now and that's it for Pokemon But if you aren't your turn-based combats don't turn off just yet as you may know the thousand-year door recently got remade on switch But the talented model that submitted this year also make a version upgrade for the version. We already knew take a look I Rob like work so much a paper Mario I think I Love retro boy I Yeah, I think this is a lot of potential Roblox in general kind of like them no paper Mario perfect combo We Oh And I said tomorrow Rosie vibes you know, thank you last zombie What am I looking at this is so confusing this is a battle simulator, I'm pretty sure yeah our Superstar simulator This will go hard as a pit of 100 trials, honestly next let's take a look at some 2d Mario trailers with the summer heat Right now, maybe this one will help you cool off smooth smooth case I Know surfing no, it's down to the platformers I love this one. This one's so funny You You You That's games old anyway, I'm not sure I think it's something where people upload their fangames and stuff You I'm pretty sure this is based around the mario bros movie I Mean at least that's what they said. Yeah. There you go. Looks like a flash game. Yep. Yep And people love this one I Know people would love this one It's nice seeing the chat actually liking it I know the e3 chat can be really negative And maybe a free deal You They have one mr. Comet You You That's some good stuff, I'm especially excited for shy guy surfing another popular branch of video games is racing games Of course and every we get tons of those to take a look Think you guys are gonna like this one, too You You The caring part of the names oops GP to pack mountain Now it's showing the games too, that's too bad like nothing I can do about that This is nice Cooper Beach one and the 3d vario 3ds while your shipyard You These maps look really good though, like especially for her fan made maps, it's pretty good And Like even an HD remake of Walrus call from Diddy Kong Racing like them, that's cool Out now and everyone was saying it's now we're gonna release in my chat. Oh I get fucked Check a bamboozle hard I Know very little about this game, but I know online multiplayer is very enticing You Hello El Chato Looks like you guys are enjoying this too You Hello the Liana, thank you You This one I imagine people also like Oregon double-touch very unique could use a few more tracks You That's a crazy rainbow road it looks so much smaller in this game We see like double dash double dash is very slippery You Who needs DLCs when you can just make infinite content yourself We're lucky that models are providing that for us another game that has received a lot of new content recently is Mario 3d world Take a look at this You Oh god, the sound mixing on this, it's a little loud, whoops. Oh god, the sound mixing on this, it's a little loud, whoops. This is not Sonic Heroes music, come on. It's definitely Mario, that's that whimsy. It's not Sonic Heroes at all. This man has never played Sonic Heroes. Anyone getting hexed is unexpected, I feel like there's plenty by now. No, no, no Mr. Comment, very different vibe. This is more 3D world? It is. So surprised 3D world is getting mods now. I bet no one expected this one. I think this one's really cool. I'm surprised this wasn't in the original game, probably for camera reasons. Okay, this one, I don't understand anything about it, you guys have to tell me how cool this is, because I don't know. I don't know what this is, I don't know what this is, I don't know what this is, I don't know. That's not GoldenEye, it's Perfect Dark. And it's based on a PC port of it. I like this one. Yes, they colored it. Hello Slam Weasel, thank you. And they actually colored it pretty well, it looks really good to me. Hello, Mr. Radical, what's your name, XCV, oh god, that's a Latin number. Oh god, this is the one segment about F3 I was the most worried about. I was a little short on trailers, you know. Render96, yeah, sure, this is Render96, but for Mario Kart Wii. What the fuck is he doing? Awesome edition. This is straight out of 2006, this one's straight out of 2006. The beans. I love the BandyGam logo on this.  Bobcraft. Interesting, but I get if that is not exactly your taste. You may be more into some more serious work. And for that, these Super Mario Galaxy mods will have you covered. Take a look. It pretends to release more demos. This looks really good, though. I wish Mario Galaxy was a little more nimble. But I guess Mario Galaxy is more about experiencing the world than about bing bing wahoo. Super Mario does that really well. So. They're never finishing the shit. Well, at least they made a new demo. It's not all bad. You get a demo, at least. That's why I love this. This is Mario Galaxy 3. Yeah, kinda. Surely one day Mario Galaxy modding might be as big as Mario 64 modding is right now. And you'll definitely get a Mario Galaxy 3. But this is also good. Nice work, but maybe you're getting tired of Mario being the protagonist. Fortunately for you, we also have some games that are not having Mario in it. Check out some of these games. It's so funny. You're tired of Mario? Well, use green Mario. It's all different now. So. I mean, eight levels isn't that bad if you make like high quality levels, right? This one's a funny trailer. In all of my years, not a single planet had beings that broke every single law of space-time so carelessly. The three towers are located in Independence Hall, Area 51, and the White House itself. Wait, why Area 51? That's where the Declaration of Independence was made. Huh? Let's make it as clear as a nice glass of water. By the time you get up here, you'll be exhausted. You won't have a single drop of fight left in you. So why don't you make like a fish? This dialogue is definitely like Sonic Heroes, actually. You're right this time. I'm going to deal with you. Yes, I am, Moriko. Get before! When will you learn? You are already dead. You are already dead. You are already dead. You are already dead. But of course, what most people really visit my channel for is the Nintendo 64 and Mario 64 mod. Maybe you're even one of those people that prefer that stuff. Lucky for you, we have some Mario 64 mods. Coincidentally, two people had a very similar co-idea. Make Mario 64, but give Mario new abilities, some of them from other games. Take a look at what these people came up with. I think you guys will like this one. It's not my turn. I'm not going to appear in F3, guys. Never will one of my own hacks be in F3. I'd rather just release them, you know. Yep. I'm not going to do that. Hello, Lila. Yes, it's Kaukwek's hack. It's finally a trailer I win. That's a really good logo. I'm not going to do that. Oh no. Yo, Shining Stars 4? No way. Correct, there's no way. It's Bowser's Dank Rave. Game. Game. In this world, it's easy for me. Stanisław Lewand is here, I guess. You're not wrong, actually. I did not have much choice between trailers. Probably because I didn't announce it on my main channel. But there's still some really good trailers. It just means that... It's like the percentage of high quality trailers was higher. But also the amount of trailers was way lower. So there's some really high quality ones. And then, you know, all the meme ones. Yo, thank you for the subs, MarkMax. Very appreciated. Oh my god, thank you for the sub, Fluffruffle. Also, this one looks like it could be pretty good. I don't know. Oh, you did DK and DX. Congrats, MarkMax. Very, very cool mod. DK94 was actually one of those games I played as a small child and never beat it. And then played it again. So it stuck in my brain for a long time. Oh, and this one. New Abarrel Roll! Yep, there's a lot of joke monsters here How dare you! I am Pigma Gengar! Pigma Balls! It's so sad that Steve Jobs died of Ligma Who the hell is Steve Jobs? The whole mod is just Ligma jokes What? Steve Jobs is Ligma Balls? No, no, no, no, no. He died of Ligma I'm pretty sure he died of Ligurone Ligurone? What the hell is Ligurone? Ligurone Balls, bitch! Fucking hell! I can feel my organs pulsing! Serve your right, hothead! I'm not sure what it is But yeah, we're ending on a... Or we're moving on to a good one I'm glad you enjoyed the Dignity And I'm glad 1.27 was in F3 Because I think people really like that I'm glad to have quality trainers like NotSoMethod Thanks for watching! Hopefully next year is F3 I will announce it on my main channel So more people know about it And then hopefully everything goes a bit smoother And that's it for this year's F3 Did you find a game you're looking forward to?
