Hello, we're two minutes early today. We made up for that one time I was 30 seconds late. Hello, Luna. Hello, Selton. Hello, CXLinx. Hello, CXLinx. Shut up. Nope, I will talk this whole stream better and you cannot stop me. You're kidding. Please don't show up. Now I want to shut up. Now I'm not doing it and I just realized I need to switch headphones because it is very hard to hear my own voice. Oh god. Hello, OldSeth. StrangleSet, she likes Knoppers more than she likes me. What do I do? Honestly, you are up against a pretty strong foe. Knoppers are kind of poggers. Whoop whoop. Hello, Pizza Brian. I updated OBS. Maybe finally we can stop having all these issues. So our mission today is to import the piano playing guy. Which Zeina has animated and modeled and he's given him a piano too. And you hear the music too in this area. We're gonna have to be in space so like when you hear you're gonna hear him in your right ear mostly. We can't hear sounds? No, you can. You liar. So this is gonna be the piano guy. All right the lighting on this looks pretty good actually. I kind of like it. I think she did a good job vertex coloring this. The polka dancing donkey bro. The fucking insane song. I love this shit. We'll call him the piano man. Well he's called the piano guy. Because he's a shy guy and he plays the piano. Do we have any OST wishes before I get muted forever? Hello Luka Lustig. Particle fleet. That's okay. Let's see what this is. Particle fleet OST. Oh it's a real game. Let's try it. This level has three streamed songs? No just one and the third. Which songs did you think were streamed Lila? And why are you on youtube Lila? I thought you were the twitch person. Also welcome to the stream Lila. Lila I did something to troll you but I you see my troll. My body hurts a bit you're trying to unroach. Oh shit you're fixing your posture. Did dry bones guy come into video? No he seems gone. Did you miss anything? No not really. All we did was listen to the polka dancing donkey and then we started 3d modeling all over the place. I feel like the lighting of this piano doesn't really fit with the world. So I'm gonna have to change this a little bit but this is already a very good start. Guys something insane has happened recently and it's changed my entire view of what I should do in my job and that is um someone explained to me what soft skills are. I thought soft skills was like knowledge as opposed to hard skills which is just like the brain cpu you're born with but no soft skills is how you talk to people. That changes everything. I thought that didn't matter. Did you guys know that? Apparently that's important. I think called social skills. I don't know. Hello Nicolas. You did know that learning how to talk to people isn't any important? Yeah dang it's all about that. Hello Dana. Long time no see I think. Unless I missed your last stream in which case I am sorry. Hello Jeff. It's going pretty well. Remaking the video game. So yeah they are actually a thing. It's fucking crazy. And when you use them it just sounds like you're trolling. That's the crazy part. So So Oh this definitely has to have a consistent color otherwise it doesn't look well. Lighting wise at all. Same with the uh these are a bit weird. Okay is it bad if your body hurts for like two days after some pull-ups or however you say it? No if you just start that's actually perfectly normal. If you've never done pull-ups before your body hurting for two days afterwards that's like literally just expected. So When you select one face and continue its projection onto an individual sphere I swear I see you do something like this when you're texturing or tweaking. UF enter or if it's not a quad you use you go to edit here. No you go to you go in edit mode and then refer and then set on the texture wrap. But you need the magic UV plugin for that. It's kind of a feature that's missing in blender so if that's the issue like you just need to activate the plugin. No pain no gain. I think you can gain without pain but the pain is not correlated. Well it's a it's not a cause it's a correlation to your muscle growth. I think that's the right way to put it. Is it all that my leg foot is burning constantly and my right one is producing gasoline after skipping leg day? Yeah you're gonna die in two days if you skip leg day. Lighting keeps striking you directly in the face is this normal? Are you a light mode user? Almost entered the wrong pipe again I'm not supposed to show this. That's a funny theory Tiger Jones. You think you're just electrifying maybe maybe you're just getting struck by lighting who knows. Okay the piano looks kind of good right? You guys like it? I think it makes for a really nice enemies. Now I didn't I said I almost did. You want me to? I'm taking this whole thing hostage. What you gonna do about it? Lila if you go for just a little bit of muscle growth no one will see that you have any muscle growth like you're not gonna look bulky unless you try to be bulky you're not gonna look bulky it's not gonna happen. But just through having more muscle your base metabolic rate is gonna be higher you're gonna be healthier and you're gonna lose a lot of fat pretty easily. You might like get a higher weight because muscle is more dense than fat but you will visibly look skinnier. Who's playing the piano? John Cena yeah and we're gonna be importing the guy that plays the piano in a second now. I just need to play it yeah how perfect is this? Yo thank you for the sub Jinxy! Two years holy shit unfortunately I'm not on twitch so I can't see how many months that is exactly but thank you thank you. He looks cool as fuck doesn't he? Yeah I haven't heard of a single person that ever said that they weren't gaining too much muscle. All I've ever heard is people saying ever since I've been to the gym I felt small forever. That's what I've heard people say because you never gain as much muscle as you want to. The more you have the more you want you know. You've lost weight even though metabolism apparently is not done. If you work out it will not slow down don't worry. What will it take for me to become a WWE wrestler? I am five foot six. Insane amounts of steroids I would say. Who is the smallest WWE wrestler? I feel like I feel like there's potential in a small guy in wrestling like entertainment wise because what matters is not how beefy you are right? What matters is how entertaining you are to watch. I didn't know muscle gain is capitalistic. Well it's not. Rey Mysterio is also five foot six. Dude fucking how is Rey Mysterio real? This special move have you dude okay who of you guys knows Rey Mysterio and who has actually looked at a special move the 619 whatever the fuck 619 even stands for but who has actually looked at that move after being a child? It's such a soft kick it's like this epic finisher but you look at it as like he barely even hits the opponent. Hello Hacker 2077. High estrogen kinda equals slower metabolism from a lot of research. Yes of course physical activity affects metabolism. The more muscle you have the faster your metabolism will be. But high estrogen equals slower metabolism? Could be true I don't know about that. So I haven't discovered a new mini optimization and that is the object lists which we need to use more appropriately because they actually stand for other things. We gotta get used to using these more. So I haven't discovered a new mini optimization and that is the object lists which we need to use So this one can only interact with Mario that's exactly the one we want. Object list level. I think that's actually the one I use most of the time so we're good. Mr. Color Doctor but what? I have no idea who Roman Reigns is. I only know Restless from 20 years ago because I stopped wrestling as soon as I found out it's fake. A little kid me used to think wrestling was real and then I found out it's fake and I felt betrayed. You're three foot two you can beat my Tyson. Honestly are there rules in boxing on how you can do your punches? I imagine maybe if you're that small it's just impossible to hit you. I mean just in the most efficient way handled like do you need a server list for surfaces? Well the point of the lists is that it splits up general actions you do so for example you can use the surface list for things that are solid and can interact with things but you can also use the spawner list for things that are solid and don't need to interact with things so that way you can skip a whole interaction sect check for every object which is huge. Wrestling is fake? No I'm lying don't worry about it. If wrestling is real to you then it is real. Well I have to deal with this animoe maybe I need to take him  Then he also has one action scene where he stops and the music will stop and he talks to Mario. I think it's gonna look very cool. Wait What did she do She broke it again after I fixed it for her One second did I just overwrite the good version of it Do I need to fix it again And she had it fixed Everything is real if you stretch your definitions enough true Let's see, okay, this one has it fixed I'm just gonna export from this guy I think I fixed it and didn't send it back to her. So me downloading it again just broke it again so that was on me I Think dialog animations. Yeah, the dialog animations are really nice. I would just be too lazy. Otherwise Okay, so here's the first result  This is true Have you ever heard of Logan and Jake Paul know who's that? What did I do? Oh They made fun of our courts, that's what they do They did nothing Interesting I Obviously, I know about them. I just wanted to see what people would say what they do to someone who has no idea Hello, Kwasim Hello Mario Mario and chat Oh Wrong file, this is not casino Oh This is Wild West There we go Remember when you said you'd made an iCovid of yourself to take over your videos have you worked on that yet? No that was not a real plan. You can't read the code?  I wish I was as talented and creative as you are. I have a few ideas but I don't have the talent to implement them. Huh that's unlucky but you can practice and make up for your lack of talent and then you can do it wouldn't that be perfect why don't I check for talking oh this one the solve function does it something about vscode bugged out do you know how to make a good rom if you're using rom manager which I am right now make a bunch of small hacks first it's just been like two weeks what am I speaking someone spoke german to me what am I supposed to do oh my god for the release of action intelligence no there's no n64 fighting game I wouldn't want to accept maybe smash bros I don't know I can't enjoy fighting games because anything that's a competitive I just turn it into a spreadsheet simulator I've decided that fighting games just will never work for me again I've gotten too good at video games and I've started to understand too much about this world to like fighting games they're no longer games to me they're just math formulas in a permanent loop that's not good the guy wasn't even there did I fuck something up when I accidentally copied area 4 I'm not remaking lost impact I'm just making more games why would I make a sequel but I can't just make another game you're missing lila on twitch dang it's too bad she died how literally how what did I do there's no way just adding the piano guy did that right I'm gonna remove him again oh wait wait a second interesting why is there two of these that could be related right if I have the same geo layout twice my hash map might run into an issue me actually it should but oh well let's just try it actually yes it might because it's literally the same case how do you pronounce your name since I say it as casa instead of case however you want no way we might have to pull out the debugger which I did not expect is the thing we have to do today simple flips is the Mario 64 romeking competition he has finally made it he became the competition dude now it's just the same level with no difference how can it be crashing I'm pulling out the debugger why don't you pin comment with the most common questions because they're so repetitive you can oh yeah I guess you can do that on YouTube that would be useful matrix on the floor cool cool cool that helps zero let's try to enter area one instead of two what could I have changed to do this all I did is add the code here there's no way we ran out of space or something like that would be ridiculous I mean then that emulator is not officially released yet just like there's nothing by the way we can remove it what if we just pretend this guy doesn't exist gonna undo and not compile and see if that fixes the issue yeah I guess I'm kind of beta testing the emulator oh that's already pretty useful for what I'm doing the permanent loop let's see if the level script is any different all that's different is that the song is linked and now as animations have been added area 5 has more condition vertices how does area 5 have more condition vertices I don't think I changed anything here oh it has less because I removed something no mind that makes sense this is just like an episode of Doctor Who what if I enter a different level just to make sure this still works that still works yeah I'm getting a very mysterious crash because I basically changed nothing and now it's just started crashing my biggest fear is that this is a ram overflow if it is a ram overflow then this would solve it if it is a ram overflow then our next mission will be to make a collision map to reduce that cost hello Skyloft oh shit it is Mario day it's a ram overflow we're out of memory cool cool all right we have to optimize the fucking level damn didn't think it would happen so soon well actually the level is almost done so it makes sense that we're getting to the end of our ram let me check something 5,000 8,800 okay so if we can reduce the condition triangles here I think it will be fine actually no we were in area 1 so it's not a collision triangles thing because actually maybe this is more I don't know I mean this alone is 2,000 triangles so if I just make a mesh out of it that just removed 800 triangles so it should be fine now but the game you thought Mario day was March 14 close enough do you have another job besides doing romhacks YouTube and Twitch yes I am a programmer I work on games that we make in Unreal Engine 5 that is my actual full-time job there we go yeah romhacks are technically just a hobby but I do work on them full-time so make of that what you will all right let's move the entrance to area 5 here for faster testing yeah it's C++ and blueprints but programmers don't really have to program in blueprints and blueprints are literally so free you don't actually have to learn how to program in them it just works you found a problem yep of course I did it's by working any any level right now I don't know he usually just sends me the finished level and that's like yep here's another one I'm under NDA so I can't say what I'm working on we make a 3ds point with the source code no someone else can do that if they want oh look at them go oh that's perfect well I still have to make them yeah all those graphical programmer things are just kind of like go to spaghetti I gotta loop that oh my god the way he goes back to playing piano is so smooth I'm also gonna restart the song whenever he talks yeah the proportions are a little weird I agree I'd switch options for the piano to animate the model a bit now I don't understand did something in vs code broke and auto-format doesn't always work anymore and it's so annoying I hate formatting code myself what the fuck oh this is awful I never want to do that again stop music let's actually take the captain ship kept a piano works well enough did some obvious code keeps breaking I think I'm just gonna play some zero over what I have that should just be mute I should set the background music in area 4 to 0 case please reinstall vs code or something it must suck so bad having to format code yourself it only has started happening today maybe it just fixes it by itself except yeah intelligence was working again for a bit and now it's just broken again let's listen to this okay I guess we have to optimize more collision triangles again man I guess it doesn't have to be collision just easier if you use collision can I just slap an ignore render on here for a bit and then do that and I didn't realize I had to switch and I'll love you to be it's gonna punch a bunch of buns yeah I've been still okay maybe the memory overflow theory doesn't check out then why would this be sometimes he abandons us for months I was streaming on YouTube only for a few months and so many people just didn't get the memo I thought people were just like oh I don't want to bother switching to YouTube and that's why they didn't watch but no they just didn't know so I think the x3 implemented yet no and it has a pretty significant mark that we found where it and that slows the game down significantly and that's 20% lower FPS than normal f3dx 2 for me it's going to watch on YouTube but I'm social anxiety what can look at the unanimously I can look at joy watch me but I don't seem to know something's wrong to make so blood red and pure fix me out is that weird that is weird the hell It couldn't possibly be me playing the music that does this, right? I did know that, Kian. What am I doing now? I am programming the next level. This is course 12 out of 15. We're currently working on a piano playing Shy Guy in a Wild West Saloon. Unfortunately that keeps happening. So what if I take all of this out? Luckily it seems to only be in the area, so that should be somewhat easy to fix, right? Yeah, it's actually in the fucking code. Huh? Hmm. Bad engine. I don't think that is the cause here. No, this should be fine. What if... What if because we check if the animation is at the end before we initialize animation, it's reading a zero pointer? Wait, that's definitely it. There we go. Well, it's starting from the beginning a bit too early now. That doesn't look clean. Okay, a few kinks to iron out. Bring on injustice, C. Why would a value being zero break something? It does this in C++ too? It's got nothing to do with C? Yeah, yeah, we'll do that at the end, fun guy. I haven't thought about that part yet. I have a parameter I added to all my spawns that set the direction and it just defaults to zero unless I set it. Usually what I do is at some point I play through the level once, I make a bunch of small notes of things that I can instantly change, then I change them all in one go, then I beat the level again and then I send it off to a tester and then I see if they run into any issues. That is straight up not a thing in other languages. What the fuck do the other languages do then? They have to do some really inefficient safety checking here to not have that issue. The hell? Oh, the animation doesn't loop, that's the issue. It wasn't an issue in the code, it was an issue in the animation. It is a mess. It is an organized chaos and you are a hater. How does this not stop the background music? Dude, the fucking not having the auto-indending work is so annoying. We can now spawn in the level without any issues, right? So let's just undo this. I can't even imagine a language where you don't use pointers. That has to be so dogshit performance-wise. What do they do? The lengths they go to just to prevent you from screwing yourself over? Crazy. All right. That's perfect. Look at it. He's done. And then he comes back in position. Ready? Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. I do not own any guns now. When the music stops, all of them should look at you. Oh, that'd be really funny. You know what? Fuck it. I'll add that. Oh, no. The heating just turned on. When the piano guy stops the music, the entire bar should look at you. Yeah, exactly. They'd be like, what the fuck, bro? Why'd you stop my jam? I was vibing. All right. We have one more thing to add here and that is directional audio. I'm going to pan the music so that it sounds like the guy is playing it. We want something kind of like this. Actually, just this part. I guess you should be able to drink the milk and it makes you tipsy and fuzzy for a second. Nah. I wonder if you could make him tilt his head to the sides a little when he spins, though. That sort of second animation could be sick. I guess, but then he needs kind of like two different animations. It's all going to be a bit overkill, I find. I mean, yeah, maybe. No, there is a train here, don't worry. Can you not make sound play from specific one location? Yes. Is this in a ghost subscript file? It's not. It's wildwest.inc.c Yes, this whole game runs on real hardware. The scene you just saw actually runs close to 60 FPS on real hardware because my engine is that optimized. Let me check what the song looks like. Channel 0 and 1. Y'all got that? This is channel 0 and 1. We could delta right away, right? Oh, I could just run this function here. It'll be j2camera or something like that. How's it called? Variable. Now... Something something screen coordinates, maybe? Dude, I wish the thing worked. Link, find the definition, please. Camera to object, there we go. Wait, how's this not an always inlined function? Oh, it should be inlined. No. I need to make a thread-free copy of this. That's unfortunate. But I found an audio optimization just now. Isn't that cool? Nope, I'm not modding Paper Mario. So C++ is hard mode, good luck. C++ is also baby mode. All programming languages are just baby modes, unless they are completely unusable garbage. Hard mode is when you start with assembly. Every machine ever only supports assembly, Kion. That's why you use a compiler. It converts programming language to assembly. Not even iCache-friendly? It is! I just found a small little optimization. Because of another optimization I did earlier, where I cut some code paths out. Do you hear the panning here? I'm not really feeling it. You can hear the panning? Yeah, I can kinda hear the panning. Wrong way? Yeah, now it's the wrong way. This is super cool. Alright, this is super cool. I don't know what to say to the player. Might have to switch to YouTube for Leela. See how much they miss you, Leela? If only you didn't die. Rip. They took her too soon from us. I'm just gonna support the normalization feature. I will probably not use it. But let's try it 1.5. Nope, he's performing for everyone, Psyo. I like it like this. It makes him the centerpiece. I don't know what to say to the player.  This is so cool.  Pasha, you wanna see the coolest part? It stopped. Now he's going back to position. And he's right back to it. Okay, you know what? Normalization. Let's keep it at 1. No, I'm not punching him. Dude, he's there for the vibe. I can't just hit him. Okay, so the piano needs to be solid. I think we can agree on that. We're not making two songs for no reason. Come on. We got one good song, let's work with it. He's been practicing this piece forever. Do you want to ruin his life? Are you saying that this guy playing the same song over and over is not to your liking? Maybe you are in the wrong locale, buddy. So my 64 only has three songs and people love it, buddy. True, actually. What's the texture? It's a collision map. Do not worry about it. You will not see this. Make Mario dance like in Mario Odyssey, where if you... You know what, fine. My autoformatting doesn't work. Do we have any Yoshi coins written down? I feel like we don't. We didn't make any yet. Whoops. Yoshi coins. Listening to the piano. So it's coin three, I think. It's four. Yeah, that was a good idea. 620 by 240. Instead of 360 by 240. What kind of fucked up resolution is that? It's a 21 to 9. If you fix the mask, I'll pay for your lunch. What mask? Why doesn't the animation play? Did I not do this? Oh. That's questionable to do this. Actually, with the current level check, I guess it kind of works. This feels like tech depth. Oh, well. If it's just these two, it's fine. This will cost just a few microseconds. But I feel like that should be enough. How about if the player chose to jump into the big clock out well, wobble and give them a coin? Did he have a stroke riding that? It's pretty cool if you ask me. We still need card games in here. Alright, time for the guy's text. Bperm4 is what decides that. Since people get upset at you for doing that, for talking to him, he should also be like Hey buddy, just sit back and enjoy. Please don't disturb me. I wish this was part of the dialogue itself and not like this. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. MatPat's final video. I haven't even watched his last video or any of the other 10 he made before that. So it doesn't affect me. Didn't you watch MatPat before this? That's a good one. You know what I do? I take this and I tell my assistants, translate this into cowboy. But he should also tell Mario to just enjoy the show. I want the player to like, no, hey, just like chill here and maybe you get something. About the 640 by 240 mod, the aspect ratio remains 4 to 3. The pixels were locked on. That's a crazy idea. I don't know. Never tried that. I don't think that would be reasonable, but. Hmm. This, this backflip is weird. Why is it sucking me forward like that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. OK, next up, let's make it so that all the guests look at you if you talk to him. It's like a city scratch moment. Everyone's just looking at you and everyone's like, what the fuck, brah? Hmm. Actually, before I do that, let's think about a better solution to this. This is not good. Could this just be in the boombox behavior itself? Not easily. Hello, Yannick. Yes, actually. OK. We are programming. I'm just going to do it like this. This should do it. And now you should be dancing, even if you remove this part here. And we're going to do the same with the boombox. This is just a minor optimization, but in the grand scheme of things, let's remove some of that. I'm going to make a mobastic trailer teaser. Yes. Hey. That works. OK. Just making sure it's also fun and cool, but we've got. I would say this would be much fun if everything was in fact, one of the consequences. It'd be really cool. The bad solution to this, honestly, is A.I. NPCs, like NPCs that get their behavior from like interacting with chat GPT. Imagine chat GPT just tells you, yeah, run away and output this voice line. Like you could have NPCs act like almost real people. Dude, which one of these is Koopa Wave Golf? I tried almost every single one now. There we go. What if they get too smart? What if they start bugging the game? That is a funny idea. All right. It still works. And we just gained around 0.2 microseconds of performance in Act Idle. Isn't that amazing? He just live watched me gain 0.2 microseconds of performance. Roughly speaking, pure gas. Don't know if it's true. Hmm. Next step. Right. The NPCs that turn their heads. 200 nanoseconds. True. Yes, there will be better testers, but it's unlikely it will be you. I don't know you. You could leak my ROM, you know. You're just a random dude to me. So I am afraid of sending a ROM to you. Hmm. Let's use something that's at 1.1.0, actually. Fuck it. This should work. Hmm. Can't they get the angle tomorrow? Perfect. Anyone can say I won't leak it. Trust me, bro. Yeah. I have no idea who you are. True. Lila is gonna murder me if she finds the ROM. She's gonna be like, Case, there's a UV error here. You need to fix it. Quick. Your game will fail if you don't fix this UV error. Hmm.  Some of these rotate to Mario. Oh. Okay, I can't implement this here. I have to implement this in Western NPC, actually. Quick. Okay, but still, I have no proof of that. See, that's the issue. I have an idea. You have to send me $100,000. And then as soon as I go over your computer with TeamViewer and I delete every copy of the ROM, I'll send you the $100,000 back. How does that sound? I'll have your money hostage. Sometimes I use it to generate stuff quickly. It is mildly helpful. Okay. Okay, I'll do it for 100,000 euros, too. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Right, and it can't happen if bperm2 is set. Hmm. Actually, it should. Hmm. Dude. If any VS Code users here know why my auto formatting doesn't work, let me know. Hmm. I forgot to set this variable. Hmm. Let's see if they all turn to me. They don't. Oh, they turn afterwards. Makes sense. Hmm. It's because of the time stop flag. Some objects just kind of pause during time stop. And others don't. And this is one of the ones that shouldn't. Now it should be perfect. Yes. I love this. Bro, what the fuck? What does my other note say? Make the bartender's Koopas hat grow 10 units or so every act. Oh, the Goomba handout song is here. They got the whole crowd laughing, bro. And it's just a bunch of neutral faces. Hmm. What is the green thing? I do not see a green thing. With the pencil? Huh? Someone explain to me what he means. Is it on my camera? Nope, I don't think so. On a taskbar besides Discord. Notepad? So I believe what we were left of last time before we started doing NPC animations was Boshi. I don't like that at all.  That's not good. I don't like that at all. How did that happen? Let me investigate that real quick. That shouldn't be possible to happen at all anymore. That's the first collision bug I've had in months. Unless the collision is double-sided or something? Nope, it's had to come back. Huh. Oh, we're out of songs. Any new OST wishes? You said the orange thing is Soundcloud? Yeah, sure. It's Soundcloud, bro. Whatever you want. Well, to be fair, we don't have a collision yet. So the collision here is a little jank. Still, I didn't think that would happen. Hmm. Okay, if you don't have an OST, too late. We listened to my favorite song. Nope, we're listening to the Polka Dancing Donkey. Alright, so this is where we left off with the bullsh** situation, we're gonna disable the camera and then get Mario out in like a position to shoot. Why Miko? This is just a polka dancing donkey, stop talking about Miko. Yeah, the Miko version is cringe. Why do you hate Toad so much, have you played Star Revenge 8, where every song is a Toad song with instruments at 37 and all you hear is the same three instruments throughout the whole time and then the entire game is also kind of monotonous, so the whole thing blends into this monotonous, like, bleh. That's why. It just reminds me of that time. You know, art is about what it makes you feel and it makes me feel miserable. That's why. Because that is what I associate with it. Play this banger? Nope. Let's listen to Paper Mario Sticker Star. So I'm a musical genius and you're actually cringe? Well, I didn't listen to his real songs. Yo, Johan, thank you for the 50! Thank you very much, very much appreciated. See, I didn't listen to the guy's real work. All I listened to were the Star Revenge 8 parts and they're bad. That's actually so sad. Imagine you work on Paper Mario Sticker Star as a musician and you deliver some high quality shit and then Nintendo just makes garbage out of it. Isn't that sad? You put in such good work and it's just tarnished by, like, the designers of Paper Mario. It was still on Star Revenge 6.25. 6.25 came out years after 8. What did I spoil? That everything is Touhou? Honestly, I don't believe the Miyamoto is at fault thing. I feel like he's just a Japanese man and he's like, yes, I have to say it's my fault because it's my honor and then he said it's his fault. We can just spoof the buttons pressed. Hmm. I don't think I'm gonna buy TTHD because like I already played TTYD. I don't wanna play it again. Yeah, if you haven't played it before, I think you're gonna like it a lot. You've returned from your hike and your socks are wet? That sucks. Dude, Zeina, you missed the Shy Guy. Are you on your PC? Can you watch this, Zeina? Look what I made out of your Shy Guy. You're gonna love this. So we got him playing the song here. We got the panning down too. And then you can talk to him. Hey, partner, can this hold off till after the hoedown? Just enjoy the show. You're ruffling the spectators. The funniest part is the crowd here. Look at the crowd. They are looking at you. They're like, what the fuck, brah? Oh, that didn't disable the camera. It just did this. That's not good. Don't be a J-list spawner, that's a bad idea. After Zeina gives the music, it's the one thing that saves the game. I mean, the music is constantly good, for sure. I wasn't gonna program a clueless, but that would be funny. It's like partner should be partner for the era. I don't want to misspell the words. I just want to make them sound like cowboys. But I see what you're going for. Let's get some stories saved, Skyward Sword. I don't think I was very invested in the story when I played the game. What's the story? Uh, Zelda. I will recall the story from my memory. This will be completely wrong. But the story of Skyward Sword in my mind is Link wakes up on the island and he's asleep. And Zelda gets abducted by the guy that licks a sword. And then the master sword calls for Link. And the ghost in the master sword tells you to collect five stones. And then you collect five stones. And the bad guy that licks a sword tries to stop you. And then you beat the bad guy that licks a sword. And it turns out Ganon was behind it all. And then you beat Ganon. And something about the banished one. He just keeps coming out of the ground. And you have to keep putting him in the ground. That's very wrong. Like holy shit. You fucking nailed it. I'm getting mixed signals here. Half of that sounds like Wind Waker. Well, a lot of stories sound like other Zelda stories. Was there not Ganon at the end of Skyward Sword? I swear that was Ganon.  I thought this is Ganon. He looks like an ugly Ganon, right? Ganon is Demise incarnate. He's basically Ganon. The precursor Ganon. Yeah, that makes sense. Because I heard that Skyward Sword is supposed to play like before all the other Zeldas. Okay. Brainstorming other ideas to disable the controls without adding code that runs every frame somewhere. Here we go. Interesting. Oh, you're in Skyward Sword with Zelda's other games? Oh, that's for Skyloft. Oh, it's because the button down is always active. In case of the kingdom, over Skyward Sword, over Witch's Mask, over Twilight Princess, over The Wild, over Ocarina of Time. Let's see. Okay, looks like Ganondorf from Wish. Yeah, kind of. But I think that's the intention, right? So in that regard, they did exactly what they set out to do. Ah, I see. This is what I do for that. I just lock the camera via action arc. Ranking these games isn't difficult because like what criteria do you use? Do you use the criteria of how good they are in isolation, like without any predecessors, or do you keep those predecessors in mind? For example, you could say like Ocarina of Time is kind of revolutionary compared to the other Zelda games before because like they were never 3D. They invented a lot of 3D staples. Or you could say, well, it's kind of just like a shittier version of Twilight Princess, right? But like Twilight Princess wasn't nearly as revolutionary as Ocarina of Time for the series. Yeah, but someone else might not Skyloft. That's why this discussion is difficult, I find. Yeah. Okay, so this lock camera action arc locks the entire camera. So that even position camera and process fixed camera volumes doesn't work anymore. The thing about Yuzo and Chihiro's shutdown, I think they could have contested it and they would have had a good shot at winning. I don't actually know how much illegal stuff they did or if they did anything illegal at all. I mean, I believe it when people say there were like illegal things going on in the discord, like but also I would also believe that they tried to prevent that a lot. All you hear about it is just people trying to push some kind of weird agenda. So I have no idea what's true and what not. Obviously, it's unfortunate they shut down like from my subjective perspective. The Mid Years of the Game lose a million sales. No one knows how many sales they lost to Tears of the Kingdom being on Yuzo. Literally, no one has any idea. How would you even determine this? No reason to emulate a current-gen system. It might run better on your PC. It might run at a higher res. It might have mods. You might just prefer not to pay for the game. One million downloads before release. That doesn't mean they lost a million sales. I emulate Mario 64 and I bought Mario 64. Yeah, probably tea time. See, that's a good reason to emulate that. You might not want to hack your PC. Because then you can't use it online anymore. What if I just manually call position camera here? That should do it. This is not C++. If you download it, that counts as a lost sales, Skyloft. Sorry. People are literally arguing for that green text of like download 10 million copies, company goes bankrupt, buy the company, delete 10 million copies. Now I have my own company with 60 million dollars to make my dream game. I think it's a lot of just like it's just to enable piracy. I mean, it definitely enables piracy, right? No argument about that. Thank you for the sub, jerk. But like, knives enable murder and knives are legal. I feel like in enabling you to do a crime,  isn't really a good enough argument. And yeah, and it's true. It is going to be much more commonly used for piracy. And it is much more reasonable to just like, you know, get it. And it's also that the company that made it loses a lot more money on it. And like if you emulate an N64 game. So yeah, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. In the end, playing games is a prisoner's dilemma. You as the purchaser have the options of like, I cooperate by buying the game or I don't cooperate by pirating the game. So you gotta choose which side of the prisoner's dilemma you pick, I guess. And similar for the company, right? They can cooperate by making it easy to play their game or they can not cooperate by making it as difficult as possible and expensive as possible to play their game. This doesn't work though. So let's figure out why that is. So pirating smaller franchises is bad. But what if there's no shot at all, you would buy it if you didn't pirate it. And now you pirate it and you play it and you tell people the game is good and maybe someone else buys it because of you. In that case, it's a small net positive for the company that made the game. Buy it after pirating it. Yeah, but what if you just completely will never do that? Because I never buy games unless someone just gifts them to me or unless I really want to play them. You don't know that exactly. It can be a minor positive for the company that made the game. Just by you playing it. Saying something is always bad is a little tricky. Oh wait, undefined reference to position camera. That's why it didn't work. Because I have this always in mind. Let me just see if this is better. If this works, then maybe we best operate the camera by just setting the position and focus manually. I should also update the starting location here. Okay, yeah, so this does it. But I don't want to remove my inline here. So we're just going to position the camera via code. Hello, scrotum. This gives you a star. I think we're going to have the camera be like here and look at that. And then it's like it's high noon. Or maybe we move the camera up a little bit like so. I think this is a nice view. There's every game, game of randomized medieval at this point. Yeah, that could be fun.  personally, not a fan of randomizers. A new camp focus is not a thing. Focus target. It might actually be render focus and not focus target. I think it is. Yeah randomizers are more annoying often. I guess it's more like, oh, you like the base game and the mechanics so much. Well, here's more of it and then you can play it and maybe it reminds you of all the great memories you had. Yes, Clueless, he gets a redemption arc. Okay, I know why that happened. Do not worry my people. I just have to remove these two. They don't have a valid behavior. They're just markers. Madpatter stat. Did he? No, he didn't. I'm pretty sure he just stopped uploading. Should we remove Ambush instead of Yoshi forever fools? Be funny, but no. No one, unless I upload, no one notices. And if I do upload, then I get less views from that. Okay, I like this view. What do you think of my Wild West view? Maybe it should be a bit more up. Bit more to the left. Let me see. Oh, that's too high up. I can see the bit more to the left. Yeah. Bit more to the left means reduce the X absolute value. And I'm guessing it's the focus. So let's move this to 77. And this one I moved too high up. So maybe 10. Move the camera forward, increase the FOV to 180 degrees. Changing the FOV is not going to look good, I think. I also don't know if I want to implement that functionality. Because the way FOV works right now is I'm doing some pretty crazy things. That you shouldn't worry about for the projection matrix. Doing things that games conventionally should not be doing. What the hell? How did I mess it up like that? Oh, I changed it to 17,000. Oops. I also have to change when the camera changes. Sometimes you just type in the wrong number. I clearly meant 11,700. I just didn't type it in. Oh, there we go. Okay, that's too far to the left. But I think the new... Wait, something about this looks weird. It's like I look at Mario from a different angle than the rest of the game. Okay. Okay. I think I'm going to change the position of these. So this one should be a bit higher. Then this one should be a bit closer and maybe lower. So we got more of an up angle. How did you get in programming? Did you study for it or just self-taught? I just started programming one day. I just decided I'm going to program and then I started. Wait, is this the position? I think I copied the wrong numbers. Whoops. Black bars above and below. Let's try it. I will give it a try. It should be possible. Oh. Okay. I have an area.h not included. The hell? After all this time, it's not part of our giant include block here? Crazy.  It's not. How is it not in here? It's cleanly extant an area. Oh, it's an area.c. Yeah. You have to show there's nothing you could do with the Yoshi kangaroo designer show last week. I don't know what real attention arc would be, but maybe you could. I'm not just gonna randomly put them into a kangaroo costume. What kind of redemption argues that? He's a cowboy and then you beat him and he becomes a kangaroo. I don't see the kangaroo Yoshi version. What? How's this crashing now? We have a pretty nasty mark somewhere in this level and I think it's related to memory. I think we're running out here. I think if I just re-export the level, it might just randomly fix itself. I don't see why a kangaroo Yoshi would be in here. That just seems random. Wait, it's because I have the temporary objects still exported. The ones that shouldn't even exist. God fucking damn it. How did I forget about that? I made that mistake before and I instantly realized. And now the second time around, I don't realize. I do not know. My life is way too busy and wild to really predict a singular date. Now you're guaranteed to realize the first time. But I realized the first time, but not the second time. What if it alternates? And the third time I will realize and the fourth time I won't. What if I only realize if it's not a prime number of attempts? I'm going to realize again on the fourth time. Project64 1.6 does not have a virus. But if someone makes a ROM, they can put a virus in it. So if you download someone's ROM and play it on Project64 1.6, you can get a virus. But it has to be someone on purpose putting a virus in the ROM. Okay, this is kind of nice, but I don't like how the bars are flickering. I don't know why they're flickering. It doesn't do this for cutscene, does it? A bit more to the right? I don't think so. I think a bit more up. Yeah. Or maybe a tiny bit. Change colors for more sepia look. You can put a multiplicative filter on it, but it's not going to look good. And I don't want to do that because it's very expensive. To be honest, how many people checked to put viruses in a ROM for an emulator? Well, no one's done it so far, but the XPoint was just found recently. So someone might do that. Just imagine someone putting a virus in a Mario64 ROM. And then they reverse the checksum somehow so that it's the same checksum. And they can also fit that into the 8 megabytes. No one would be able to tell. And now suddenly you're just getting fucked. Any recent performance boost you can share? Yes. Okay, here's a cool performance boost. When you store any memory value or read any memory value on the N64, the game has to... Like when you store something, the game has to load the entire cache line, store it in the cache, and then modify the value in the cache, right? So when you write 4 bytes, what you really do is you read 16 bytes, and then you write 4 bytes in cache. What you can do to prevent that is use the CACHE INVALIDATE DIRTY something something instruction. Don't remember what it was called. To invalidate 16 bytes of memory. And then it just marks that byte of memory to already be in cache. And then you can write to it in cache without ever reading from RAM. That saves you one RAM write every time you write 16 bytes in a row. So I use that a lot in my rendering thread. And it's halved a lot of memory bandwidth. That's one cool optimization. Oh, we actually also had a very minor optimization on stream just today. Because I noticed that there's one function on my sound thread that I can inline. Isn't that neat? Okay, I think I want the camera slightly higher so that the clock isn't cut off. So that everyone knows that it's high noon. Just like 30 coordinates more and then we're good. It's high noon. Okay, yeah, something's definitely fucking with Mars rotation. Yo, thank you for the sub, LazarNation. The pitch of the Mario sound does go lower than in the original game. I made the screen a little bit longer because I thought it'd be funny. And it is. This sets Mario to act automatically, right? Yeah, okay. Let me see where this gets. M face angle, okay. This should do it. Yoshi wasn't in a kangaroo costume. Well, it still kind of looks like a kangaroo costume. I don't like it. No, I just don't see it. Doesn't seem related to this. And it's also not a kangaroo costume.     It's also like from a new Mario game. We want this to fit into like the 1990 era of the world of video games. No, he does kind of look like a cowboy. I want to frame a bit. Why? I don't want him. We don't need one. Okay, let me just check that the clip looks fine now. And I want to check his animation real quick because I wasn't looking for it before. He should be no longer rotated. All right, there we go. This is the vision we were looking for. This needs a good song too. We're going to have to give Mario a card gun. And then there will be a countdown here. I think I need to 3D model a countdown, which will give us memory issues again. Oh, well. It will be the card gun from Mario Party. So this is from Mario Party 2. So it's not like we're breaking the law here. Let's see if we can find it. Yeah, it's like this. We're using Fast3DX2, but we want to use Fast3DX3 in the end. Right now, it just doesn't really work as optimal as it should. This animation. No, we're definitely copying this gun from Mario Party 2. It's important that it looks the same. I'm going to ask QED if we can rip this. Wait. Will there be a writeable Yoshi? Probably. Okay, anyway, I think I'm done for today. We need the card gun to continue this. We're going to model a countdown here. The countdown is just going to go 3, 2, 1, go. We're going to have ominous music. And then Mario will pull out his card gun. And... Whoever shoots first wins. It's going to be funny. But I think we're done for today. I'll see you guys next stream. Bye bye.
