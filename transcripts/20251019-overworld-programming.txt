And I'll dev run Cosmo Unreal. Hello, don't scream waltzy. Hello, hello, hello. Hello, heliopan. Hello, sultan. I fixed the safe block crash that we had. It was a crash with out of memory actually. Hello, mindrage. Oi. Hello, biomech. You like my music? This song is amazing. I kinda don't like that anymore. I think we should investigate a different way of opening part 8. Again, where's another one that's about killing yourself? I have never heard the one that's about killing yourself. I only know of the cat version. Who pinged me? I don't know the original song. I only know the cat song. I do not want to know the original song. Hello, eleven. Slevin. Slevin, eleven. I do not know the cat version of Chop Suey. No surprises by Radiohead? Fine, we'll listen. Actually, I don't want to listen to it. I'm gonna get copyrighted. Look, this is music with soul. This is one of the few songs that are not cat covered by AI. I don't like that I just got the coin. That's a bug. Let's fix that real quick. Guys, you have no idea how much time I spent in the last few weeks refactoring stuff. I... all the Maori64 actors... Look at this source. Game Behaviors. There's only Chain Chomp, Pokey and the Whirlpool left. I'm gonna remove the Whirlpool after Biowake finishes the Ice Cap rework and I'm gonna make our own Whirlpool. The Pokey, I'm gonna have to remake him because he's very buggy. And the Chain Chomp is the Chain Chomp in the zoo, so there's not actually an antenna Chain Chomp. So with that, all actor code in R64 is removed from the game. Except for, like, Mario and some minor parts of the Goomba. But it's basically all gone. Which is good. And then I only need to go through all these files here. And then we're like 100% custom code. Slowly getting there. Okay, fine. Let's see if I actually know this one. Keep Biowake away from the beach. He cannot be trusted. That already? I don't know what's wrong with me when I program this. This is so clearly not working. I hate this. Do you know if Nintendo follows your progress? I think maybe? Okay, here we go! Mario? Here we go. You got this. Here we go. We've released a new non-standard game, we're introducing an island called SEO Destroyer. Imagine if they actually just make the game we're making, but with like Odyssey graphical style. They're just watching every stream, and they're like, fuck this guy! Is that script array or a union? What the fuck are you talking about? Any OST wishes for today? Okay, so I want this area here to be blocked off when you first get to the overworld. Initially we had this planned by there being... The tunnel's underwater here. You're Nintendo's nemesis number one for reworking the theme sometimes. So initially what we had planned was that you'd go down here. To the end of this part. And there'd be something you'd break. And then stuff would fall down, and that would open the path in the overworld. Hello, Samuel. But I no longer like that idea, to be honest. Now there's a whole underwater overworld part. The underwater tunnels also lead you back to Area 1, where you can find a secret star if you go to the end. So this really connects back to the first overworld, which I think is really cool. I was gonna put an all-alone bubble dome in there, with like a submarine. I was gonna put an all-alone bubble dome in there, with like a submarine. So that would be all-alone bubble dome. That would be the thing that you break so that you can enter this part of the world. And that would be the secret star from part 1. There will be so many secrets in this goddamn game. There will be so many secrets in this goddamn game. But yeah, now that I think about it, I think the way to enter this part needs to be different. Because it kinda stinks. Rendering two coins is no additional cost over rendering one coin. So the second coin is just like 50 triangles. It's about as expensive as rendering this basket here. But the first one's very expensive. Yeah, let's think about it. There's tons of Yoshis here. We had the thing with the fish. We might put fish in here. Over here it's going to be Koopa Wave Cove. Where there's a seal that you can pull out of the sand and then the seal will take you to the Koopa Wave Cove. There's going to be a surfer Koopa chilling here. Eventually there's going to be the Pirate Raid here. I don't think we want to wait until the Pirate Raid to open it overworld. You thought the fish were how you got to the hole? The fish would get you to a different hole that would lead to Marty's secret level. That's what you wanted the last time, as far as I'm aware. Or where the fish are also going to lead. Oh, there's two holes here. One is going to be covered and the other one is going to be obvious. It's a little weird. If the perspective is different, then obviously just double the cost. Anyway, over here just leads to the industrial area. This is where the invaders would follow the fish to the big obvious hole and this is where they'd land. Then there's a Wario. That's absolutely a Wario. But this is a fair point. This leads to Koopa Carnival. Bowser's Theme Park. And then this leads to... Overworld Part 3. The ship in Pandora's Box. The Bomb Cab level. And this sucks. What if there's a yapping block here already? The first yapping block to hint at the Kamek boss fight. The problem then is that that opens up with everything else, so I don't like that. But I also don't want the player to get to every overworld part at once. Because if they can go here and here and here, you open three levels at the same time. And that's a little much, I find. I think one or two is the absolute most we can do, otherwise it's going to be overwhelming. I could make it so that there's something you have to do here to enter Part 8. Sleeping Snorlax. I mean, we can put any arbitrary barrier we'd like here. It can be a star count, it can be a certain star you have to collect in a different level. It can be a side level you have to beat. I think that's actually a good idea, if there's a side level that we need the player to beat to get here. Just keep in mind, that's just one extra level that you unlock there. So it doesn't really matter if the player can get that right away. Actually, it's the Bomb Cab and an extra level, so it's kind of like two levels. But it holds true, it's fine if the player doesn't get the level until very late. Hallo, Rainer Hase. We still need an OST actually. Any OST wishes for today? Let me look at the side level list here, if one of the side levels could do what we want. For this level, the Aza Windflower slide. Golf Mario. Rising Lava Level. What the fuck? Okay, so I'm back. Golf Mario. Rising Lava Level. What the fuck? Okay, something about these is still very buggy. Oops. And as I said, I didn't restart the game yet. This game has a very serious end. I'm not bringing about most of the next games, but I'm curious about the last. We use a lot of the creatures from that game. So that it feels like roughly the same world. Mario Damacy? Alright, let's do it. Oh, you mean... Pachyderm. Yes, we actually haven't used Pachyderm yet. And it kind of fits that he'd be there. Because, you know what, actually now that I think about it, this is kind of Bowser's area. There's the Bomb Factory and there's Bowser's Theme Park. So it would be fitting if there was someone standing guard and not letting you through until something happens. So what would happen? We have a Minecraft Level. Plants, maybe? Rainbow Slides. Shy Guy's Seek. The Pinball Machine. Hell Diving Race against a Shark. Planetary Gravity Level. A Wind Capacitor Level. A Fruit Base Level? Okay. Hmm. The whole thing, Sunny. The whole game. Okay, sorry, Blairon. We're thinking of a way to block off this part here. The path to Part 8. The initial plan was that you would find the underground tunnels. And you'd open a path from there. But I don't like it. The reason I don't like it is that you'd find them during your initial exploration of the overworld area. If you were to explore everything before you move on. And that would be overwhelming. And also it feels unintuitive to ground pound something there and then something up here changes. And I think they're not far enough apart that it would feel like a callback. So I think we need something else to do it. Some kind of secret that they'd unlock that would open the path. Hello, Eggnog. Yeah, Sunny. It's all custom assets here. So you don't need the textures. Probably vanilla decomp. I don't know. I kind of like the idea that there is one of Balsa's minions blocking the path. Not necessarily Pachyderm. What if one of these minions sent you to one of the side levels? One of the mechanical side levels. I think that'd be a great way of doing this. Because that would give us a place to put one of those levels. While also blocking this area off in a good way. Yes, the bone transmission is very cheap. Makes no difference really, performance-wise. It's gonna be a couple microseconds at worst. If you do it right. Oh. Very unlikely that a Wii emulator can play this game. Do you want to work from a Biomech? I draw a V1, something like what you would see here. Then I send it off to Biomech. He kind of has an idea of what I want there to be in the final. He often doesn't show me any in-progress pictures until it's basically done. But sometimes he has questions about what's viable and what changes are allowed to be made. But he has a lot of creative freedom over it. It's rare that he makes a change and I have to undo it. I don't know if that ever happens. I'm thinking, which enemy would fit here? I mean, I'm thinking something like a Womp is perfect. Actually, now that I think about it, does this even need to be blocked off? Because aren't we going to have a Womp that blocks off this part here at the end? What if we just let the player go here? Or we could say something like, there's the Womp that was supposed to block this with 30 stars. To be like, well, this is the special park just for Bowser's minions. You're not allowed to be here unless you're an elite minion. Collect at least this many stars to get here. We could just put that guy at the front of part 8. Because all of this feels like Bowser's Park. I don't know. I'm also thinking maybe we could do something stupid where you have to disguise yourself somehow. But how would we ever do that without it being shit gameplay-wise? Pay toll to enter? I don't want to do any more pay barriers if I can avoid it. The pay barrier is the absolute last resort if you have no other idea. Okay. Yeah, so I'm thinking a big, big Womp here. You talk to him and he's like, this is Bowser Park, it's only for Bowser's special minions. You're not allowed unless you're holding on to at least this many stars for Mario. So that you can't get up. But that's kind of weird, because there's so many guys in there that don't have any stars, now that I think about it. It's kind of not great. We need to return this missing hammer. Patching items is not very fun. We gotta get creative with it, I think. At least, actually, I feel it's even better that he crushes you. I mean, that's funny, but I don't think that solves our issue here. A little puzzle. I would kind of like if there was a solid rock wall here at first, so you don't even notice that there's a path. Do you know what I mean? There's both streamed and sequenced music. What if there's just a big asshole dinosaur sitting on a big thing there, and he keeps throwing boulders down. And he can destroy the boulders, but every time you destroy one, he just throws another one down. And he tells you it's futile, you can't do anything, and you have to somehow kick him off there. A bomb that has his eyes closed, so you almost can't see it. If he does that, his eyes are open, and he sneaks back in. You know what, I like the idea of using a bomb. Bombs are pretty funny. There could be a bomb that's just a gigantic wall, and he looks this way, and he's sleeping. And you go to him and he's like, I'm so sleepy. I'm too sleepy to do my job and move back and forth. I know it's an important job, moving back and forth, but I'm just so sleepy. And then you do something to make him less sleepy. You know what, that's funny. A bomb going like, yeah, I have an important job of going fucking back and forth for all eternity. That's beautiful. You guys are all thinking ideas that are way too complicated. We need simple stuff, stuff that's straightforward. And then how do you get the bomb awake? You just get enough stars? No, we're thinking of Bombs, the guys from Bombs Fortress. Kick him in the fucking eyes. Will he get mad at you? Wait, what if there's a big bump here? And he's basically asleep, and he's like, I'm so sleepy, I can't be bothered. I need a kick to wake me up or something. And you kick him, and he's like, what the fuck did you just do to me? I'm gonna get my son. And then his son shoots out of the ground, and he just fucking shoots you into the sky. His son is just like a fast, small bomb. And that brings you to a side level that you have to beat to enter here. That would be funny as hell. And what if you need the Cloud Cap to beat this level? So you have to find the Cloud Cap to enter here. Wait, that's amazing. Yes, you need the Cloud Cap to enter this part. And you get the Cloud Cap right in this overworld. I think that's great, actually. No, no, they shoot you to a side level, and you have to beat the side level to enter there. And then you have to go to a side level to get there. And you have to beat the side level to get there. And then you have to beat the side level to get there. Yeah, I was thinking of this as a simple way to bring down one of the side levels that we had planned. So there would be a side level entirely focused on the Cloud Cap. Or no, it would have to be focused on the Wing Cap, because this is where you get the Wing Cap. Well, they shoot you up, and Mario goes, Wow! And the screen fades to white. And then you're in the side level. Well, it's because they shot you into the sky. I'm not sure what that is. I have a game design document that's just a big text file. Do we have an underground level? Let's see. We have a minecart level. Where you just need to get to the end. We have... Inbalm Machine. We have Pick Your Power. We have Pick Your Power. We have... Inbalm Machine. We have Pick Your Power Fruits. With the Double Jump Fruit, then the Pepper Fruit. Well, I guess it would just be a Pepper Fruit. So that could kind of be here. Yeah, that's about it. What if it's the same thing, but the sun is actually the floor Mario is standing on. Big pair of eyes opens on a Mario. And the bombs are thrown or seeds on the ground, taking it to another level. Yeah, that's also a good idea. So would this be the Pepper Fruit level? Hmm, what else could it be? Is side level all based around dynamic lights is what I had written down. We could combine this with the Pepper Fruit level. So... How would this work? Yes, two mechanics in one. How would a level based around dynamic lights even work? I guess you'd have a level that's all subdivided and there'd be flames going around. And it's pretty simple platforming. Yeah, fair enough. And I guess the goal of this level is to get out. So... This might be important. What if there were more pairs of eyes? Like 7x6 was Mario, like run confused. Nah, I like the bomb. Um, RGBA32. That's the format here. It's a 32- no, it's a 16x16 picture. Yes, there's going to be a map here. Hello, Aka Ray? You're back? Okay. Yes, so I'm thinking they will send you underground, that part's good. And then there needs to be like an escape sequence from a very, very dark cave with a few lights. Let's think about the light sources. Reduce everyone room with 1x9, that's the exit. And the whole room is a platforming puzzle on how to get there. Escape room with platforming puzzles. Yes, that would be the idea, Biobank. If we went with the proper idea. Wow. Yes, RGBA32, what's so funny about that? Nice, Aka Ray. Aka Ray. Although I feel like a glowing path, or well, a dark level and the pepper fruit kind of have anti-synergy. With the pepper fruit you just want to fucking go, and with glowing lights it's all about going slow. How is that nice? What are you talking about, Toilet Duck? I think I like the escape room idea. Although it wouldn't really be an escape room. Would there be like lights you can carry around? True, Biobank. Let's write down some light sources, because what's your light sources? Flames? Maybe Bob-ombs? Bob-ombs could be very good light sources, because... Like, small lights for glowing, big light when exploding. Hmm... How would we imagine this? Just a cave that you start in? You have to like, climb up some pieces? You always have to follow the light, basically. Using 8-bit information is gonna slow down. Okay, but I would also lose alpha fidelity, so that would look worse. We have made the conscious decision to use RGBA32. Just tried to jump into your car at a protest? Dang. That's crazy. Let's see. Hello, Kevin. These are not your silent enemies. I guess there's lucky to step big lights. How many places do you have? It's in the dozens. Quite a few. You know what? I should... No wait, nevermind. I'm not doing that right now. Hmm... But usually there's only like, 3 or 4 people per level, I agree. Before it moves on to like, the next phase of beta testing. It's typically enough. Okay. 166 for the orange, yellow and GFX? Guess, just a rough guess. It's like... 256, 1024... Around 3 kilobytes. You can't donate yourself into a beta testing position. I can't do that, because that would be illegal for me to do. Jumping fireballs are good too. You can write that down. But that's so lame, everything we have is fire. But that's so lame, everything we have is fire. What about mushrooms? What about enemies? I want like, an enemy that glows. I want something that you can kick. This sucks. Baby? Or like a baby Yoshi? What if it's an escort mission? Should I get some torches? That's kind of a great idea. Kind of an escort? Like, escorting a baby. Throwing crystals? That sucks! Should I get torches? I know! Okay, but glowing baby Yoshi is kind of a banger idea. Like this guy. Okay, we're not doing boomers. Those with entrance are also very fitting. Those with entrance are also very fitting. You already have the tongue Yoshi in Mario's head, the mechanic is there. Yeah, we can just attach him to Mario's head. Yeah, we can just attach him to Mario's head. They only appear when looking away. Well, we would probably use glowing shine guys, but is that really good? I don't know. I think a better way of doing it would be maybe if you started in a room. Where there were multiple exits, but there was one huge glowing thing. And you go to the glowing thing and you find out there's a baby Yoshi stuck here. And he's like, oh, you fell down here too? Let's break out of here together. And then maybe he jumps on your head. Now for the rest of the level, you have this glowing Yoshi on your head and he lights the way. And then the level just, it's a standard level that looks cool. I don't know which enemy here would be glowing. How's it different from my extra thick fog? Well, for one, it will look very cool. And for two, there will be like Bob-ombs that you can see and fire and stuff. So there's going to be places that are lit up. I really only want this to be a very small section. I don't want this to overthink this. I don't like it. Haunted mineshaft with glowing boos. Okay, you know what? Why don't we just combine this with the minecart level then? How about a glowing mineshaft even? How would that work? I mean, there's only one minecart level, right? Am I missing something? One section underground? Yeah, that's the one section. What would be different in this one? Nothing. Fair point. Maybe we should cut this level. No, I'm not sure I'll rename this. Okay, but a fully dark level is a great idea. I'm just thinking of a way we can pull this off that isn't too complicated. We kind of need something that is entirely hex tessellated, which is also a bit of an issue. Do we stream another day this week? I'm going to finish the icecap by then. There is a good chance I will stream tomorrow and maybe also Monday and maybe also... What is hex tessellated? Let me show you an example. So this whole thing is going to work with pervertex lights, obviously, right? So we need to make sure that the vertices are always spaced apart in a way where it will look good if we put light on it. So if we do something like this, all the vertices are the same distance away from each other and it's going to look fine. So we could have stuff like these types of shapes. This way we can make most stuff dark and have lights here. And you see how this is going to look fine? Right? Whereas if we had cubes, it would look very weird. With the lights fading over variable amounts of distance. So the entire level kind of needs to play on a shape like this. Okay, it's the same as the icecap. That's good. It usually looks the best. I mean, we could have this be a spiral that goes up, kinda. And there's various glowing objects on the way. We could have this be like a tunnel. Well, a tunnel is kind of like a mineshaft. Imagine you start here and you go around the outside until you're all the way to the top. And there are some holes you can fall into. I can, but that limits the graphics a lot. Any thoughts on how to mine shaft? Honestly, it seems kind of fine. I'm just a bit worried that it would be frustrating to actually have to look at the boos. What if you kill a boo and then you can't see anymore? I don't know. The idea of ghosts as the lighthouse just doesn't seem very good to me. I don't know. A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. Yoshi yoshi, and it's platforming from then on. When dark underground water level has an angle that shifts the light sources, that honestly sounds way cooler. But we actually already have something very similar to that, so... A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. Yoshi yoshi, and it's platforming from then on. Yeah, that sounds reasonable. That sounds similar to what I first wanted. Now, Lucky Choo doesn't follow Mario in this game the way he does in Mario 64. A small maze section. Yeah, underground water is dangerous because it's such a strict time limit. A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. I'm not sure what you mean. Is this what they do? I don't know. A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. Yoshi yoshi, and it's platforming from then on. Glowing ores from minor light sources, yeah. A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. A small basic section with glowing boos lighting up the path. Exactly, Dempy is his name. Let's do that. Fuck it. Predication hides shit in dark corners, also true. How big are these, we need them like 100 or 200, or they're too big. I know it says 10,000 triangles and it's a little risky, I know it says 40,000 triangles and it seems a little risky, but don't worry, we're gonna fix it. So okay, let's make a path here. Is there, like... Ah, haha. Wait, I have a bad idea. What if the path can has a shape like so, that's too boring, and make the path like so, have it loop back around on itself once, and then the exit is here. What do you think? Maybe the exit is here? So you'd start here, and you'd follow the boo around, circle around once. That's like one loop. What do you mean that's one loop? There's not much to do in there. Did I make the cutouts too big? Are you thinking something like this maybe? And then we can have a little bit of a secret here, maybe here. A little misdirection here. Is that more your taste? Yeah, there's going to be ups and downs here. Alright, I will wait for your concept then. I know you love me. I want to word you up into my life. Let's roll up to be a single star in the sky. I hear you calling me. I want to word you up into my life. Let's luff up to make a single star in the sky. While we wait for Biobank to do that, we can continue on to the next thing on our list here. Actually, let me write down what we have now. We don't do the rubber thing. There is a big, sleepy bug in the back. He says I'm pretty mean, isn't it? To kick him, he gets mad and calls his son. To build me up, I will word you up into my life. Let's luff up to make a single star in the sky. Did we not note down that this is the entrance to level 6? Oh, we have it right here. 8 on the ground. Man, this overworld is stacked! We're not doing disco music, don't worry, we have a good plan now. I think the dampy-like event where you follow a boo works very well. Or well, it doesn't even have to be a boo, it can be anything. But the boo is the easiest one. While we do that, we can think about the secret entrance to Dino Domain. I'm going to put it here somehow, but maybe that's not for now. I hear you calling me, I want to word you up into my life. Let's luff up to make a single star in the sky. Let's luff up to make a single star in the sky. Let's luff up to make a single star in the sky. We can work on the chill crow, but do it while we do this. What a banger song. What did you guys think of the PBR coins I uploaded today? Did you guys like that? I have already a few places picked out where I'm going to put them. Looks good, nice. Oh, what is going on here? I don't think this is what they're supposed to look like. Or is it? Yeah, definitely not. What the hell? When did this happen? Oh, okay, fair enough. There it is, where you don't actually see the boo. They're always very maze-like, branching across everywhere. But there's always a light just past the corner waiting for you. And at the end, you arrive in a big room where the boo is waiting for you. And he's glowing because he has the star in him. Oh, oh. Okay, on one hand, I like this. But on the other, that means we can't really have pillars in the middle of this. And hex tessellation is going to be very difficult in a squarish thing like this. But the boo having the star inside him is a great idea. Let me know what you think in the comments. Yes, maybe? But these would be so high poly, wouldn't they? But what's the gameplay here? Don't you just kind of walk forward then? Hmm. The gameplay is just atmosphere and vibes. So we will generally just have a maze here. With the maze being filled with poison gas or something, so that if you get stuck, you just die. Okay, I like that. So you think just this is fine? I suppose it's possible. Just a second. Okay, probably. And the board off, we don't need to hyper polish every level anyway. Okay. The atmosphere could be the main factor, yeah. Okay by the way, how do we make sure the player doesn't get stuck? I guess that's a question for me. And how do you want to hex to select this? We need something where it's like, or maybe if the boo is too far away, it just fades out and kicks you out. Maybe that's a way of doing it. But then you can't explore. Maybe the boo walks back to the nearest knot that you aren't at yet, so you can't get stuck. How's that? I guess the last unknown for me then is, how do we make sure that the tessellation is fine? So we have one main path, because it's going to be the winning path I guess. Something like that. And then we need a bunch of side paths here. We can also connect those side paths back to the winning path like so. I think that's fine. Maybe someone's going to find the giga shortcut, that's also fine by me. Is something like this what you had in mind, Bialik? Then we have a structure like this, and then we go along it. Hello, squishy stash! And of course we can add some heights and depths to this as well. Oh, I didn't mean to make a fall there, oops. Wait, no, I mean to... The fun way to make it feel interesting without being frustrating is to have the boo be sliding faster than the character and turn out of view one or two times. He's basically going to be almost always out of view. So when you start here, you're just going to see the light coming from here. So you go here, and then when you see the light, the light you will slowly retract into here, you're going to see it coming out of here. So the boo is always going to be at the next knot that you are not at yet. PSP, possibly it can be used. I mean, I use BVH for collision, that's a type of PSP. Do you watch anime? Yes. I find that anime often has much more interesting settings than normal TV, so I prefer watching anime over a normal TV show. Out of question, the tessellation! What do we do with the light? That's clearly not it, right? Hmm... I'll do a hex tessellate a square. Is there variable size volumes? There are variable size. Do you like any Gundam? I don't know what a Gundam is. How many kilograms do you lift nowadays? Like on what lifts? Which lift are you asking about? I think this could kind of work. Deadlift? I currently train with 393 pounds, so it's like... I think like 180 kilograms. So is it only a lot more outlandish? Yeah, exactly. Then it's part of the fun. This roughly has the same distance between all the vertices, but it's not quite perfect. Katamari Damacy is crazy. What the fuck are we listening to? It's the song of all the children that love Katamari Damacy. Oops. I wish I knew an easier way to do this. I'm sure there is one. Oh. Oh, this is... Oh my god. Okay, this is not hex tessellated though. The problem is, you see how this line to this line is the square root of 2 shorter than this line to this line? So you're gonna randomly have 40% slower transitions here between vertices? Yeah, exactly. So I'm trying to make this in a way where basically every line has the same length. Okay. And I suppose some lines are shorter than others, but it's not by a whole lot. And that's the main part about this. Right, what we could do is put this here, but then it bulges outwards. Okay. Exactly. That's why I was against the mineshaft at first. Until you said you can hex tessellate it. Okay. But I think this is close enough. And we can also do this. I'm not a fan of this tessellation to be honest. It is kinda true that this is not subdivided enough. Maybe it's fine. Like 100 units. It's kind of decent. Hmm. Oh well, this is like 160 units. Some of these are more like 200 units almost. Shit. It's a little much. We need a giant light source for this to not be obvious. And I think most likely Mario is going to be a light source too. Well now that I think about it, these aren't really that big. Which might be another problem actually. This might be... This probably would feel very claustrophobic. Probably needs to be scaled by 2. Yeah. I think realistically we need to do this. And then move these here. And maybe now we have a decent tessellation. This honestly, you can't really see the length being so different anymore. Right? Have I changed anything at all? Hmm. What even is going on? Eh? Is this where it loops? Right? Square? Hmm. Well it's still nice that short stocky triangle at the top. Other than that it's basically what I already have. I think it will have to be this. Hmm. The lines being a different length isn't an organic look? No. Ugh, okay. I guess we have to go with this. Okay, before we fill the whole path again, we should probably experiment with it first, then it should look good. Okay, this should be enough for the experiment to be honest. Maybe one more line? One more line. Okay, so we are going to try to make dynamic lights here around Mario. We're going to make everything black. And then... Hmm. It's basically going to look something like this. And a cookie brush? Why do I import this level too? I think we need to figure out how to add new side levels. I haven't actually done that before. That will be interesting. We need to add more overworld pipes to our test overworld. Hmm. I don't think we need the fences anyway. I don't think we should have this. Do we use this? We actually do use this. Interesting. Okay. That's all we stand for. Okay. We're going to remove this feature altogether because I don't actually want this. Okay. I have overcooked chips. Let me just make sure the star dancers still work. Okay. Oh no, how about speedrun? Oh my god, let's have a speedrun. That works. Okay. Nice. It worked as intended. Okay. Should the game come on Steam? Hello overcooked chips. Honestly, I might make a custom IP version, so who knows. What do we need this for? Sec2, course name table, oh I see. Oh, define course and stuff. Is this generally just course numbers? Where are the EEP bytes assigned? The second number here doesn't mean shit, right? Okay. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Banger music started playing. We should do the pause map soon. Even if it's just something crudely drawn, just having a map here would be so awesome. Okay. Let's check Jordan. Okay. Level to course name table. That seems completely wrong. Level to find.h Oh my god, there's a second one. I forgot. Okay. So much wants to course them. The third number. 1, 2, 3, course bdh. Oh, I see. There's course nonce in here? I guess that makes sense. So, these occupy a level ID, but no course number. Got it. I should probably clean this up. Okay. Okay, 1. Delete this thing at the start. Delete the sub-levels. Um... The inches for each level. Delete texture bin. Delete at the stick inches. Delete echo levels. Delete dynamic music table. Delete camera table. Um... And then once we have that done, it's going to be much less painful to add new levels here. I think we need to add new EEP bytes too, though. Yep. We need to add a bunch of new courses. Course count. Course defines. Oh. Oh. Oh. There's bonus stages. What the hell is this? Course stages count, okay. Huh? Oh. Oh, so it just places the thing there, and everything before that is... How does this work in an enum? I'm actually not sure about the syntax here. So, it just says bob is bob which gets assigned to 1 and then wf is wf which gets assigned to 2. And then bonus stages is the amount of bonus stages. Course stages max is the amount... Well, no, this is just the amount of stages? Why would this be a define? That doesn't make any sense, right? And then course stages max is 1 less than that. Oh my god, this is such a stupid hack, edit or not. And then course stages count. Isn't it the same as course stages max? It should just be this. And this doesn't need to exist. And this is just 1 less than that. So what are we just saying? Fuck this. Fuck this. And we replace this. Doesn't this make more sense? Am I stupid, guys? Am I stupid, guys? Course count. What does course count? What's course max? Wait, what the fuck? What does course end? Oh, it's the comma I'm missing? Oh my god. Oh my god. I think this is what I have to do. Right, but doesn't this make much more sense? Oh my god. That's why this just gets sent to 16 and course stages max gets sent to 15. Isn't this the same? Am I stupid? We give up on the shaft? No, I'm currently working on adding more courses. Yeah, this was done in a weird and hacky way before when this was so much easier. I think, unless I fucked it up. No, this is not Nintendo code. This is decomp code. This is code written by the people that decompiled Mario 64. In the compiled code, you will just see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and so on. Oh yeah, occlusion counting will help a lot here. I'mma be honest, I need to figure out how to add more stars to this without fucking everything up. Before I can do that, I want to clean this shit up, because this is unworkable. There's so much unnecessary stuff here. Before we import the mine shaft, we're gonna do this. For now, let's work on the bump. You know what, there's an easy way to figure out whether I just destroyed everything. I had 10 stars before. If I still have 10 stars, it's probably fine. I have 7 stars. I have 7 stars. I have 7 stars. Okay, wait, let me undo that. See if this is any different. I changed the star count somehow. Oh. Okay, we do need to figure out what the fuck is going on here. Okay, we never need core stages count, right? Okay. Good. Surely this will be fine too. I think after the installation it doesn't solve the problem. But I think this works pretty well. Oh yeah, I'll pull it off the other screen, so you can't see it. Smart. Yeah, so this has somewhat evenly distributed lines. It's about the best we can do. Okay, I don't understand why we need zero entries here. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna figure this out another time. For now, it can stay this way. It's fine. No, there were still big differences. This gets somewhat close, but there's still lines like this, which are fucked. They're like 80, and then this one's like over 200. And then even if I scale it down, it doesn't really fix it. These are a little shorter. I don't think there's a good solution here. I mean, I guess we can remove these. That might honestly be the best solution. Yeah, now we're gonna do it hexes anyway. But the edges are twice as long? What do you mean? It's like 300, which, yeah, that is a lot, but it's not that bad. I don't know. There isn't really much we can do here. Well, let's see what we can do for the bomb. Is this Persona music? It sounds like what I remember Persona music to sound like. Yeah, I agree that wobbling the terrain a little bit will mitigate it somewhat. I don't think it will fully mitigate it, though. I don't know. Actually, it doesn't need a fully flat floor. I don't know. Hello, Zemus. Is your name actually Zemus? I feel like I know you under a different name. That's from the profile picture. Is he over him? I knew it. What are you doing? What are you doing? Why do you need to know that? Who are you? The CIA? Nice. That's pretty cool. You took the whole week off your normal job so you can rig your own character? Nice. I also just work on RTYI when I have a day off my normal job. That's pretty cool. The way the sound goes is pretty cool. I kind of want to play the Mario Adventure Hack but I already know it's Mario 64 physics and I'm just going to be so annoyed by it and I don't want to get annoyed at it because it looks so cool. Oh shit, you're getting married! Congratulations! What's your name? Lizander! If you fail or if you fall Lizander! You may never find your way Can you feel your life tangle you up inside Now you're face down on the floor Oh oh oh But you can't save your sorrow You'll fade and trade And you can't help but follow I'll put you right back where you came Lizander! So I was thinking something like this for the sun bump and then his father is going to be right in front of this If you fail or if you fall Lizander! You may never find your way Oh oh oh Oh yeah Alright Next we have to design the bump character Let's see Bump I think we have to give him fully 3D eyes so we can probably make him look sleepy That's fine by me This looks a lot more awkward I find Can you find your way Lizander! Hanging on the edge of tomorrow Lizander! I kinda wanna make sure the player can't just jump over him Lizander! So he's going to be a little bit giant If you fall Lizander! You may never find Let me check if this is big enough Add a roof That's kind of a good idea I guess to prevent the player clipping or grabbing it Wow List of assignment index out of range What? List of assignment index out of range Is it because we changed the define for the courses? What is managing to keep working on this project for so long? I guess, what else would I do? What do you want me to do else? List of assignment index out of range Target cuts in values I knew it List of assignment index out of range We have such a weird assortment of songs today Dude, anyone else, when they go into their YouTube studio now It always says, prove your identity No matter what you do I can't use YouTube studio anymore It asked me to prove my identity like 10 times a day This is generally so fucking annoying It started under the sky above This is the beginning Move over First stage is Maxiscon Are you kidding me? Here we are, in your eyes Showing you what you can't see Force count undeclared here Fearing that eternity Here we are, in your eyes Magic in the air Guess I removed this I think it's because I removed that Rays burning through the cloud Down from the sky This is the beginning Long ago it's always started Under the sky above No time for beginning And it's worth it To love Oops That looks so easily jumpable somehow Yeah, it needs to be way bigger I'll tell him to undo the changes What's the holdup? You know what, let's make the roof first Actually, let's get the texture first And then we'll make the roof To perfect it, I have to Tab a number on my phone Every time I want to use YouTube That makes sense It's an American Adventure 2 With 1000 stars It looks very cool I'm surprised how well it runs And how good the texture quality is Given That I know he can't use Toon Cycle Because he has like a special RTP thing Or microcode thing going on So that's pretty cool I'd love to play the game But I just I don't want to play with Mario's Normal Controls Mario's Normal Controls to me at this point Are kind of painful So that's a little unfortunate Are the rollers or not? They're pretty cool, they're in-game I might make a case clips video About them at some point So then I could easily show them to you That's a little bit too obvious 2 bumps don't lag usually I think the 1000 star thing Is a little... People get very excited about 1000 stars But I mean, look at it All the stars are more like red coins Is there enough to go there? At least the mario.inc.c file It's not enough It's not gonna be that easy Maybe bricks are gonna have something Give me two factor No, every time I open YouTube I have to verify my identity Look, if I go to YouTube here Give it like 10 seconds Let's say I wanna read my comments Nope, prove your identity Click a fucking number on your telephone Like a star I run To the key of J Like the night I fight To the final one In the rain I say Each and every Each and every one Till this war is won And I dance around By the sword Smashing through the every inch Of the power, the power in you As I stand, stand By the table I command My own I'm not alone I'm not alone I'm not alone I'm not alone I'm not alone Dirk Watch your thinking as you turn to me Cause what I have in my two hands Is enough to set me free Set me free I can fight the feeling To resist it over time When there's just too much to take You speak up from behind Is it me you say you're looking for? Let me show you who I am And what I'm here for Here for Hey Try to reach inside of me Try to take my hand Show you just what I'm made of Simple curiosity Try to take a bite of me Show you just what I'm made of now Like a million faces I've recognized them all And one by one they've all become A number as deep as the sea And one by one they've all become A black mark on the floor Is it me you say you're looking for? This is who I am And what I have in store Here for Hey Try to reach inside of me Try to take my hand Let me show you just what I'm made of Simple curiosity Try to take a bite of me Let me show you just what I'm made of now You can take another try Hey Hey Hey Try to reach inside of me Try to take my hand Let me show you just what I'm made of Simple curiosity Try to take a bite of me Let me show you just what I'm made of now Try to reach inside of me Try to take my hand Let me show you just what I'm made of Try to reach inside of me Try to take my hand Let me show you just what I'm made of now Hey Try to reach inside of me Try to take my hand Let me show you just what I'm made of now Simple curiosity Try to reach inside of me Try to take my hand Let me show you just what I'm made of now Hey Hey Try to reach inside of me Try to take my hand Let me show you just what I'm made of now How do we do his eyes? Yes, Shuki All 12 major courses and everything except for the overworld and the upper side level system I was thinking an eye texture and then like a half sphere that can close and open He is very sleep deprived You little shit This could work honestly This could work honestly This could work honestly This could work honestly I was somehow expecting this to look very different This could work honestly This could work honestly I like that You know what I mean? That is for real I mean if you move the eyelashes like so Then I can see this working You see what I mean? I think this has potential I have not seen a playthrough now Well I have played a very little bit of Banshee Kazooie One thing I really noted is how often the game is just like oh you like 3D platformers? Well fuck you, here's a minigame That is something that regularly bothers me in randomware games What if he was only able to raise his eyebrows like this? And that's his eyelid I'm awake Honestly I like the modification for the bottom part The one for the top part is not good I'm sure from here we can figure out the animation There are so many fat just like every second talks about how you're fat and your jaw is fat and the enemies are fat No, it does not have the R2, I'd have to manually support that. But it's not easy, it's not difficult to support. I'm sure we actually use Blanchard somewhere. Get the rainstone and animate the texture with avoids and such to make it look like he's blinking or whatever. No, I want the polygons. Blending it on the texture is the obvious thing to do, obviously. He doesn't really look sleepy though, right? Sleepy emoji. It's because his eye is closed. I think he does look sleepy. Fat muggy, scary wobbly text. That is bizarre. That sounds like the game didn't age well at all. I suppose this was made by the same people that made Conker's bird for the raid. You'd kind of expect them to not have a very good sense of humor. Shape keys and mores will literally just work. There's nothing you need to do to make them work. Or, well, I mean, okay, that's a bad way to put it. You can literally just move vertices, there's nothing you have to do. Just move the vertices and it will work. Now, how you want to store them, or your shape keys or whatever, that's up to you. None of my business. I think this is what we'll do. Alright, we'll keep working on this tomorrow. I'll figure out how to import the course in the meantime. And then we can also already make the entire site level. I'm hoping that next stream we can finish an entire site level. You've heard it. Also, on Monday it is my birthday. I don't know what I want to do for my birthday yet, but maybe we'll have a Giga stream. Maybe. So yeah, I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye!
