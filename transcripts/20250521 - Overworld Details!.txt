Ah I broke my setup just before the stream where am I there we go okay we're safe um hello mario luigi sm64 good morning mimoski I will not acknowledge Lilaa calling me that word that's not me no way she would say that to me she wouldn't not our Lilaa is there any frights on in the game no hello clayman so well something's super fucked you had an upload of sushi to shakuhachi and after a while I can't find it is it removed or was that a false post that is a true post um it's my most recent video hello rye 21 go I'm actually planning to upload another video on this saturday and then another another video on um shit when is it the 14th of next month so oh wait it's the fog controller that's what's going on so dude you guys wouldn't know but sarin did the coolest thing ever for the retro section that I will not show you guys yet but it is so cool I kind of want to show you guys so I have sarin no hello toki hefty gamosken buddha I am decently built okay so let me think about this how is this supposed to work zero one two three I think I am supposed to get this comment here  returning to Yoshi Island gonna go hard for real for real true for real for real will this work too few arguments huh deal start word one flag word two flag huh am I stupid right now um any ost wishes for today by the way how is this too few arguments I am so confused what are you saying my son I'm saying he did a really cool thing for the retro section in the final level Sonic Heroes is a banger ost let's do it sims 1 ost oh that's tempting actually okay seriously what did I do wrong does anyone see something stupid I did can I think art art as in musical art so you guys know how breath of the wild ost is like it's like one song that smoothly transitions into different sections that's kind of what's all rendered and it is so cool I see will this work why does it not work can you save your first shake or spend them on bullshit I don't know what to do when you're not left from bleed and set an engine your asm anyways this is more convenient I don't want to have to deal with the geo asm yo thank you for the subscription shit I can't read your name no oh does this work that works okay so the problem is what the fuck I like comments  shit so this might not work at all hello selton I might have to do something really annoying then like um um actually this should be fine  um um yep that compiles didn't like chocolate cake until you were older man you weren't young and naive yeah are you still not liking chocolate cake yeah I'm sorry do you guys know ice cream cake ice cream cake is a banger do something special a lot of stuff here like a lot of the pop and it's gone now I find that we have a lot of issues with uh decals now for some reason we didn't used to have those issues so but yeah these old levels are going to become a lot more playable soon because we broke them over time with engine updates so making them playable again is very cool it's actually really fun to work on bug fixes for these it's easier with my friends do some kind of tutorial once the engine finishes um I don't know I don't know what that means it's the goal of today's stream make some progress in the overworld we want to finish the first round of adding shaders to this that's nice good I just got a new pleco I love plecos because they're so cool where is my fog it's gonna be all right well the prim color works but the fog doesn't I'm not sure which one you mean because there's Jurassic Jungle and Divine Dino Domain it's an ugly fence yeah it's very old and yes it used to not call the back because that used to be a static camera angle the sign is also just wrong the level is no longer called Big Boo's Cruise it's also just missing the fog I imagine that you're mine in my world you're gold I only want to protect you dude I love this new system with the bitflex this is so convenient I want to get my repository into a state where I can execute a script to export every break the whole repository dude there was a cover of someone I know of the song that I loved a lot and she made a really good version of it and I wish I could still listen to it but she deleted it and I'll start to re-sync it since she said no there's some Yoshi NPCs still optimal in the big overworld um I was thinking the entire world should just be dead I'm thinking of also removing the textures and then also I think Mario should move automatically so you don't even have to play the game here oh you definitely should stop smoking pot pot is no good okay that's nice the way it like becomes foggy I like it  you're walking on the bridge that makes the worldwide it's gonna look better in the end I'm pretty sure the idea is that as soon as you walk here you just kind of fade out unless you did the lighthouse thing in which case the ship will stay visible but everything else will go white oh this version is awesome these are old as hell let's go see stache  so we have to replace this with primitive color half halted by the light of you you It's decent Oh, no the gates of hell have opened I Wish fuck Review work, right? That would be cool I Said what's not volcano with fuck true This is the ass the Eggman watch this song, isn't it? Out of our any life given up on fuck video, it's okay. It's not a necessary feature I Have you guys seen that Instagram real where it's like You land on a bow the space and the punishment for landing on them since you let Bowser cock you But then it is revealed that that means like Bowser is sitting in the corner watching you You Know I never played Shadow Generations He's made it so peak I hate Sonic games Blender can preview object models. You just need to be willing to do the work to import them If both adventure games in your top of volumes, yeah, but I watched general generations gameplay and this didn't look interesting to me  Sonic adventure is more than just run forward to me anyway Shadows I don't know about that First question does it have a jar garden Second question, how are the analog controls? Is there like a reasonable linear gradient? Is there a huge dead zone? Really okay, that's surprising Somehow this is this is a we have lost this technology meme, but somehow between the year 2003 and the year 2025 we have lost the technology to make good analog controls You think the baby was trying to say baby, I don't know about it The boobah that's the baby she's calling the baby the boobah You just a position the faster you go, which you know, so it should work Analog precision. No, maybe you lose turning radius, but you shouldn't be losing analog precision You Yes, absolutely nothing in a video game that should make you lose analog precision unless it's like a troll game Why is the baby saying maybe is she stupid yes, she is I Seems of a drag you jump and you miss all your speed. That's lame Actually, it might not be lame depending on how it starts. I Will not pass judgment before I've seen it. I Want to play need for speed next actually, that's the next game I want to play But I still need to find a PlayStation 3 controller is she a Pokemon or something true I Don't know if you can really convince me to like Play another Sonic game other than the adventure games because every time I've tried one, it's like I'm so disappointed  Yo, thank you for becoming a member Alex Boost is definitely not my thing  The fact this fucking song is singing about SPO is so good I Do you think you have more grace conjecture for that which is definitely more grace kill  Dude I was almost saying like I should have a theme song like this, but then I realized like There's nothing stopping me from like making myself a theme song. You know what? I mean? I'm a youtuber like I could have a theme song wherever I appear And Then I think about YouTube a theme songs and it's like he's the angriest gamer you've ever heard And I'm thinking okay, maybe maybe I shouldn't have a theme song, you know what I mean  How do you make a theme song for yourself that it's like not cringe You have a math I don't remember do I study math I watch your stream watch the stream Hello devils, then it's a good thing I don't know personally for my money. I would study I Can say like me and your brain is math true Lilaa are you actually good at math? Yes, okay leader. This is this is offensive But to me you seem like type of person that would be like good at math But when asked you would always claim you're bad at math I Mean I have seen pictures of you. You cannot convince me. You're bad at any science option It's not gonna happen Do it bang woman Yeah, Lilaa kind of looks like this like like the What the hell why is it all no, I just wanted to have nerdy looking women. I didn't want the boobs You mentioned the nerdy emoji that's what Lena looks like You You wanted more 60-foot living and look what I look like dude look at this I Got muscles. I'm not a nerd. I am beating the allegations I Sorry, but that's the rule of the Internet if you have muscles you cannot be criticized You have muscles it doesn't matter you're a girl You Need to look guys need to look like the Giga chat and you can't criticize them girls need to look like I don't know what Girls need to look like to not criticize. Honestly, I think if you're a girl you just shit out of luck You wish it's bad, right? Yeah, maybe that would shield you from any criticism like that a Buff notice that all nerd faults Okay, so I'm at the time you have to get fucked up. Nope I Was not being misogynist on stream I Was Acknowledging the struggles women face I Mean and because he didn't even know what 5g was until the phone unboxing it. I knew what 5g was I just didn't know what the fuck it's supposed to mean on a phone Like what does the 5g mean in the phone's name, you know what I mean? He's like, huh? I mean shorter wavelengths, but more frequent. Okay, but what does this have to do with the phone? It's not like a signal type doesn't mean the phone is 5g compatible, maybe God suppresses Lilaa that sucks dude Did I just found out about misogyny damn that shit sucks I Love that mean Have any of you guys watched BNA I'm currently watching it with Zayna And it's like It is either the most racist show I've ever watched or the most tone-deaf show I've ever watched I Seen so that you got a wife. Yes betrayed man. Actually, I think insults love me Because I've gotten so many comments about how I'm like the perfect Aryan man or like How I'm the giga chat How I'm ascended How I have like superior genetics I've had I've gotten that like a crazy amount of times So I would say incest love me Hello mental illness, what's up? Mm-hmm BNA the old enemy because someone's a bit tone-deaf. I don't know although how old it is. No, not DNA BNA BNA is like There's this girl who's turned into an animal human person and the animal human people are being like oppressed by the rest of humanity and then like as the show continues it turns out this oppression is completely justified because The beast people are just naturally violent criminals and also every poor person is stupid But in a funny way It's basically what the show is and it's like, huh? Is this the message you want to send I Mean the metaphor wouldn't be bad if like, you know, you didn't fully justify it for no reason And then it's like oh whenever beast people look with too many other people They just have a tendency to get violent. You know, they just cannot live in society. They just cannot be civilized like that Like okay, what are you trying to say? This seems like some straw men concocted by actual Nazis I Mark separate game than a new free mark. Please. Yeah, I think that you can respect I did not know that that's like a thing in utopia. That's funny if true I But the idea of like making an entire show just to like have it be a straw man is kind of funny It's an assault on Lua scripts, oh good luck Mmm, you shouldn't have to sell a soul for that unless you're sort of like really cheap I Fucked up the wrong material And Wait, have I Oh No, I got that I got the right one, okay, well good But it's anything cool and like the characters and sister this just s now We've started Gary's one on the occasion, I don't know ask robot he seems like the type to make that You And then on the other side very early on the L and describe this just realized racist vaginas really I don't remember utopia I Don't get the hole in the mountain it's weird So it's uh We did a little digging, you know, it should be less square though, I agree You True, it is a Japanese show, so maybe they were being genuine and not stupid. Let's left on a sec the overworld and some side levels. No. I love blue because I'm a dude. Lilaa please don't misgender people in chat. First warning. You mean what? You misgendered yourself. In both cases, yes. So what are you going to do about it? Cry? Piss your pants? What did Tony do when I was hungry? 28. Yikes. You guys will never guess how long it took me to understand 789.  Speaking of pronouncing words in a fucked up way. We should like put out some kind of punishment for people that say shit off instead of should have. That is legitimately worse than mixing up their, they are and their. Should have is fine. Should off is just... No. Should have. Should have. Is that a British thing? How do you pronounce it should off though? Come on. In case of a single stream where chat doesn't bring up National Socialism. The Brits can't tell whether they are saying off or have? Really? Come to think of it, the one person I have talked to that kept saying should off instead of should have was a British. Should've. I do read should've like that as should have. Okay. Okay but this is lowkey beautiful. Okay. I think we also need to do something with that so that it properly like fades into white. Because this is gonna look weird otherwise. I like how everything goes white though as you get to the ship. Can we mark him jump rating high? This is a skill you unlock if you are really good at Mario 64.  Yo, Casinopolis. We should model some grapes after this. This is the worst fucking stage. Casinopolis is the worst fucking stage. Okay, how do we get this to properly go white here? Maybe also with a prim color fade? I have no clue.     Maybe with Rail Canyon? Just use fog? Okay Lila, how do we just use fog? Where does the fog start? Because clearly the fog can't start here because if it did then this would be white when the rest of the stage is no fog. Do you see the issue? No. Hmm, don't. Hmm. I guess we could program the fog controller to make no fog at all appear while you're on this side and then when you're on the other side fog appears. That should work. So let's try that. Okay. So it doesn't work anyways? No. You would see it from the distance. But it's okay. Okay. Let's try something like that I suppose. Okay. I want my test to start in a different overworld. Why no fog in everything anyways? It could have a nice orange vibe. No. What the hell?  Where are we going? Oh, castle inside. That would do it. Can we set the vertex class of the exit end of Tadano to make it look as though the fog is fading in a minute if that makes sense? Nope. Okay. This comment is actually bad. I am not aware of it being hated. Okay, so far so good. Okay. Okay, this is kind of cool. I kinda like it. I think it works. But I do think the fog should start earlier. No. It only worked because I changed the way the fog works to start at 1000 instead of 970. We still have the issue that there is no fog at all here now, which I do not like.  The fog should start around 12,000. Let's start the fog around 13,000 and see if this works fine. We might have to square the alpha. Okay. Actually, rooter. To bias it to far values a little bit. Bit sketchy. Okay, I want a little bit of fog appearing as I am on the beach. Okay, yeah, we got some fog here, which is good. Yeah, I think I like it.  Oh, that's not good. Actually, that's fine. It will look a lot more fine once that one also has fog. Hmm. I am from Germany, yes. Are you writing me about my car's extended warranty? Okay. Okay. You know what? I want to make a grape. We are making the grape next. From Deutschland. This is not a grape. So I think we want individual grapes. That you bounce off of. And they need to be separate actors. This feels like a grape-y shape. Okay. I think shape color multiplied by prim plus text zero is going to look great. So we can make prim the base color of the grape, like so. Do surgery on it. I hate that meme. It was never funny. What was the point of it? They did surgery on a grape, okay? Where's the joke? Why are you saying that? Okay.  How's this for a grape? Yes. If you don't speak English, no one can understand you except for me and the other Germans. And that would be sad, wouldn't it? Offset and detect German. Wait, why? Okay. I suppose this does look kind of nice. Okay. Okay, chill. Don't hurt me. I like it like this though. We're doing this.  Got any G-waves? No. Okay. I think you can understand the meaning of what they did, it's not just about the grape. Think about it, if you can't do surgery on a grape, what's the next strawberries? Nothing will be the same again. That's still not funny. If it likes it's too many, hope that helps. Dude, I love the hope that helps meme. Only the most obnoxious type of person would say hope that helps. It's like when you tell someone have a nice day after you clearly hate them and wish them to not have a nice day. It's like fuck off dude, you're clearly not trying to help, you're an asshole. Me after spitting in your drink, have a wonderful beautiful happy day. True. Also, I love the confidently incorrect hope that helps. You very confidently state something that's clearly wrong and you're like hope that helps. P-graded behavior. Have you watched the real-time tech demo Castello by Paccava?  Now when the tuna shake is requested, we will drink the tuna shake. After we got the 10 out of 10 requests. It's on tiny3d and looks wicked sick. Oh that's cool. tiny3d is a pretty cool project, so that sounds pretty neat. You like wicked things, evil is cool. We already knew you were evil. Tech someone you would bite if you were a car. Sorry, brain rot. Why is the OBJ in this level when you saw it? Oh, actually that makes sense. Okay. Where's my grapes collision?  And I forgot to add stunning area. Holy shit. I forgot so many things. I actually also just realized that I need to do this. We need this. No, Lilaa is not working on fast64. No, no. Is that the reaction you were looking for? I mean grape is an accurate function name because this is the code that controls the grape. Yes, it saves me a lot of time. Because you are misusing updates and PRs. How am I misusing updates and PRs? I didn't do fucking shit. That sounds like a good idea at first, Alex. The problem is look how Mario is moving. It would be weird to like do this and then he starts balancing and then you just do this or something. It'd be like the visuals do not match the actual gameplay. Unless we only trigger that animation if players actually were going slow. In which case I guess that kind of works. But I don't really want to implement that. Unless we actually have like a mechanic where Mario slows down and walks along the spars. But I don't want that mechanic. I think it is much better just to not have that issue. Just don't have the issue, bro. Okay. I think I'm giving this to squishy sound. Rare squishy sound effect. Ah, I fucked it up.  Here it sounds like freshly cut grass. That's crazy. Cut grass mod is pretty nice. Shit, I need to send my lawnmower out. Dude, I love my lawnmower. Look at this. I'm right here. I can open the lawnmower app. And I can be like... Come on. No. Charging station blocked. Are you fucking kidding me? Nevermind. I thought I could send my lawnmower out but I can't. Okay.  Actually this wouldn't look very good. Let's get the same color as the Shy Guy. I know what 5G is, I just didn't know phones had to be built specifically for 5G. And I'm still not confident that's true. We're removing all loops, by the way. Turning all of them into ticks. Whoa, what is this? Okay, let's take over this entire code and see what happens. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool. Cool. I mean, sure, you might be right that 4G is more convenient to use. But how are you going to brain control with 4G? It doesn't work. The government needs 5G to brain control you. I mean, unless you're vaccinated, then 4G is enough to brain control you. Everyone knows that.  By the way, if anyone has any of those 4G or 5G or whatever, you just get your phone within two months. You can turn voters and call stuff in. Cool. Wow, this one's unused.  This should do it. Give it a little bit of sound. Hey!  I like the grapes. They're good grapes. Wait. You can do that? Oh, shit. Give me some changes.  Uh-oh. You were like saying you didn't play any of the previous Sonic games. What about me? I did play them. And I kind of liked them. Sonic Heroes is the latest Sonic game I have kind of liked. Hmm. Now, I think I want the volcano rock here. Where about that one? This one here. Let's add volcano.  What the fuck? Bye-bye, Sam. Yo! I saw a video today about all the animations that are hard to see in Pokémon Stadium and holy shit, that game is good. I will now refuse to play a Pokémon game until we get that quality again. Which means I might have to commit to never playing a Pokémon game ever again. But I am okay with that. I am doing this to improve society for all of us. I am such a noble person. This is how gamers think. Bye-bye. I mean, I agree with you that most likely, if that's like your quality standard, you're not gonna play another Pokemon game for like the next 10 years, minimum. But honestly, I am fine with that. You got scammed into buying it? What does that mean? Is this a song request, Moldy? Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow! This is a very meowable song, canonically too. I can see how Pokemon Stadium would be disappointing if you were expecting like a full single player experience, because I have played Pokemon Battle Revolution, and okay, well, actually Pokemon Battle Revolution doesn't even have the multiplayer experience. I bought it, or I played it, thinking it was going to be Pokemon Stadium 2, 3. Yes, definitely. I always say that the battles are just kind of like a method to like, make your Pokemon feel valuable as friends. They are like a necessary evil, because I mean, clearly the battles are not fun at all. Why did you just spam your strongest move? That's just objectively not fun. And I mean, there's also clearly no strategizing, because like, you can always just overlevel. So in my opinion, it is clear that that cannot be like, the fun part of the game. Banger alert, I guess. I am familiar with the combative battling scene, but that's not the single player experience, so what the fuck are you saying? Once it was very wooden, attack or crits animation goes then back to the same animation, by the time you control again, you could have taken a short nap. That's true. That's all Pokemon games. They could make us have to engage with it, but the single player is always still over just having high damage attacks. Well, the question is, is it desirable though? Because if you think about it, like competitive Pokemon, at its core is a math optimization problem. And like, who enjoys those? Very few people. I don't think a math optimization problem would have mass appeal. I think RPGs sometimes pretend to be math optimization problems, but then in reality they are really fairly simple and straightforward in the math optimization department. So, it's like play pretend, you know? It's a peekaboo. This beach is where you lost your virginity. In my chat. Whenever it's being designed for both single player and multiplayer, it's starting to feel like a mistake. We're battling in the RPG single player. Strongest playing. This is one of flying into freedom. In a math optimization problem, it's more mind game than anything. Do you know what a mind game is? I mean, in the end, like, a mind game, taken to its extreme, is just you mixing up your options in a Nash equilibrium, which is something you can mathematically compute. I can with absolute 100% certainty say that it is possible to compute the perfect Nash equilibrium, the perfect strategy for any Pokemon battle. Competitive, I mean. Also non-competitive, of course. Where if you had determined this, you would now just be mixing up your options in the calculated equilibrium, which takes any mind game out of it. But any mind game taken to its extreme becomes a math problem, where it becomes a Nash equilibrium that you have to compute. Most RPGs are fantasy or feeling smart, and the level of fantasy can't be too hard. This is true. Yo, Dashbot, thank you for the 5 euros. Buy an N6 for this game? Dang, that's nice. I think, I mean, this is gonna run well on N64. So on N64, you're guaranteed to have a good experience. I hope. Unless I mess something up and the game has a bunch of crashes and I can't fix them. Mind game man in your mouth? I would, actually. Do you think that Alpha Air could be used to find much better optimization for hardware such as the N64, considering it's so good with mathematical constants? In its current state, compared to the current N64 technological advancement, I don't think it can come up with much useful stuff, because it is trained on more generic problems. But I kind of have no doubt that in like 100 years, maximum AI is going to surprise humans and can do stuff like that. When's my studio new math? Yeah, I've heard of the new matrix multiplication algorithm, although I haven't seen the new matrix multiplication algorithm. Couldn't find it anywhere. I don't think it's actually faster, because it also has shit lot of additions. Just less multiplications. I don't believe in consciousness Zelda, so that question makes no sense. What about Sigma AI? I don't know what it is. Is this a meme? I don't think consciousness is a thing. I think it's a feeling and people confuse it with a thing, you know. I was on an audio stream watching the Google I.O. conference. They kept showing stuff they announced last year and saying this year it actually works. This time for sure. What did this do to the Google stock price? Let me check. Was this any good? Ewww. Stinky. Stinky. I added the grapes file back. We now have grapes. That's what you missed. You could have been here watching me make grapes, but instead you were listening to Google telling you that things work for sure this time. Double promi. No takesy-bakesies. Grape work. True. Does Mrs. Case do when Case is on his computer all day? Well, she is also supposed to be a work from home person, so she would also be just working. She's currently still working on the Penguin Town for course 13. Alright, let's check it out. Cozy and depressing at the same time. Yeah, it's gonna be a vibe. I'm gonna get some Squid game model stuff and I'll start working on the assets. If you have another stream like tomorrow or Tuesday, we can check out the rework. Tuesday, maybe. Tomorrow, definitely not. Is there not green near them on the ground? Look at my grapes. Okay, this is starting to look great. I like this a lot now. Does anyone want any feeling to be called consciousness? If anything, there's nothing against it. But only reactions to stimulus? Yep, I think there are only reactions to stimulus. Most experience is also just- or all experience is also just a feeling. Did I mention I got advertised? So I missed? Oh. Um. Um, um. What did you say again? Oh, I said tomorrow I definitely will not be able to stream because I have my job. But next Tuesday I might be able to stream. There's going to be so many NPCs here. Hmm. Hmm. I think this part of the overworld is finished. Oh, except for the ending here. The part that goes to the next part. Anyway, to be honest, I think today is going to be a short stream. There are some things I want to get done. So I will see you guys in the next stream. Yeah, Thursday also not possible. I do have work. Anyway, I'll see you guys next stream. Bye bye.
