You I Fixed the BNJ crash from yesterday a few days ago Nice stripes. Thank you. Hello my back. Hello ion So I finished a layout for the whole pyramid thing and now we're moving on to texturing and I'm very much at the beginning of this I Did run through this before to test the gameplay and I'm not sure if I like it or hate it It's kind of interesting It does feel maze like but because everything connects back to the main path it's like not that bad I'm using my own engine Kanki No, that song was way too loud So, what do you mean by is it safe to ask are you worried I'm gonna make fun of you or something You don't have to jump every step You can just walk up At least most of the stairs I think there's one staircase you have to jump and every other one you can just walk up Which yeah, this is the one that's gonna feel bad. I agree Okay, but never mind this one you also have to jump up but This you can walk And this one you can walk And this one you can walk And I think this one's fine if you have to jump it up because it's like a very short staircase for this one, maybe I agree This section I think is a bit weird It's when you can also walk up, but I don't like the section at all definitely something I want to change You got a few places where it's just like an abyss like this I think it's fine if you can walk up I think it's kind of fun to get lost in this whole temple And I definitely expect people to go through this two or three times, but I think it's fun The one thing I'm actually most worried about in this area is the camera So Considering you likely have to go for its twice. I'm no longer so sure about this exit here Because like if you exit here, you're gonna have to walk all the way back. Oh Actually, you can walk this way Shortcut for the pros Hello Selton You Okay, there's a problem with the particles and I know what the problem is hello sky left And It's definitely a desert pyramid This one here I Don't mean the water particles here. It's gonna be funny kids area. I like the TDM slide and six videos for the Yoshi coin Hmm And already have all five Yoshi coins, although I guess one of them is a little bit poopy there So it wouldn't be so bad to move the Yoshi coin But No, if the exit is fully yeah, maybe if you can jump out of the cage So like a cage just around there and then maybe a method to get back up to the top of the pyramids Is that what you're thinking? I think I would like that Although I need to think of a way to get back up there I  There's no boss in the stage hello cost a loan Yeah, okay, it's a two-stage two changes three game design this section here fucking sucks and We need a simpler way to get back up to the top of the pyramid Great follow the structure too slow. I see you see you need to go back in like a mysterious look out No, we do have the problem right now that you might go through the entire maze without collecting all eight coins, right that's actually the most likely outcome and Then you need to do it again, basically So I want the player to easily be able to get back up here and not have to go the entire way up the pyramid again So if there was a place here that caught you and put you back up that would be perfect Glad you like it Sayo I'm gonna have to judge the Zelda competition soon So my steam open I've been playing UFO 50 UFO 50 has one good game and 24 bad games and 25 games. I haven't played yet. But the one good game is really good Can you guess what the good game is You Okay, when OST do we listen to today how about origami King McMarvel and desert music There's a mix here perfect I Mentioned central room with all the best eating in and out of it, but eliminate the problem I see what you mean, but I Mean yes that that would be like a fun thing, but I feel like game design but it's not as interesting. It's like a very It's something that's been done like a million times before I wanted to try something new Many kingdoms is a dump behind me. That's I think 145 kilos right now I Didn't some ups in there to reconfuse the hell out of place. I think it would be fun in the pyramids That would be evil For c64 I Love it Hmm I Don't think this is a bad design. I think it's like confusing at first And it might be something that the players won't understand at first But it's like you go through it once and I think then you will understand it The only issue I have with here is that the camera a lot of the time is poopy So that's something I really need to look out for And the question is also if we can just put the play out back up somehow We could just have an instant warp at the bottom that goes back to the top Actually multiple instant warps wouldn't be that bad If they wouldn't have to be so many Understand it after to replace maybe I'm asking too much of the player This is a really dangerous design, too Six doesn't need to be installed on over the level looks fair enough I Mean that's just wasn't the right idea I think all the ideas used here and all the pieces of geometry used here can still be reused into like something else But I think maybe maybe we need something else You make a fair point Let me feel but assemble room that makes it easy to explore the paths But put instant maps to take you around the places against your will That is a cool idea Hmm So there would be something like the central room is here and that's like a downstairs path and There's an incident on the downstairs plus to something upstairs that leads back to the the central path. I Can see that working. Well It's made up like three or four instant maps like that Yeah, I like that All right, I'm taking notes here One central room with two stories and for four exits And then every exit is a red coin or maybe more than four Could be Yeah, I'll just read that for now You Yeah, I see what you mean I like that idea Yeah, I see what you mean I like that idea Yeah, I see what you mean I like that idea Sucks I did all this but most of this is reusable. So it's fine. It's fine. It's fine Smaller house also connected sometimes. Yeah, we probably need more than four exits then and then Some of these are just only outs and others are in and outs, you know what I mean? I'm just gonna leave a text here that says unused early concept You And if you do it that way then we don't even need the easy way back up so that's fine All right, let's try this again You Oh, I played this yeah, that's that's a good inspiration My brother owned this game and he always wanted to play that game Okay, this is a conversation I actually had before Someone needs to invent a good Card game something that is like complex and not luck based But also not just a copy of chess it's something that actually makes use of the fact that you're using a deck of cards You this is a playlist called all Mario desert themes, but it's like all ten minute songs The nature of a deck of cards is that it's random. Yeah, but you can still have something that involves a lot of skill Doesn't have to be all random You So if you have something like this and then there's Mm-hmm. Yeah, this could kind of work One game counts now it has to be only with a deck of cards If there are games for the deck of cards, but like almost all of them are all for Hello Liliana has it been a while I think it has You I'm thinking there should be a big statue in the middle of the room You 30 bits Wait, I haven't seen it yet You Does it not show up well, then thank you for the 30 bits, but I don't know why it doesn't show up What I model and more donkey dip Let me just show you what the model and more donkey Oh, I'm using every stream app and it just shows as a normal pannuku on my screen Seeing myself a reason of each wilds would you consider sending a job offer to Capcom to fix it? I don't apply for jobs. I never did actually I did once That's why I got my job You Yeah, one retro section is supposed to be vanilla Mario 64. Eh. Sometimes the thing I say is just the most cooked thing ever. I can't control it.  Fucking victorian interest me what is wrong with my glass? Huh? I'm just like two foot five tall how big are your glasses? What purpose death points now buy things in overworld? Honestly, I do have an empty aquarium I could be drinking out of that was a red coin and not the spawn point cool that explains why the crashes the thing is my pitcher broke so we have two sinks and I like to use the sink to fill my water Zena likes to use the sink to store dishes and when I went to get water the sink was full because Zena was storing dishes in there so I just put it like on the edge of it and fill it with water and then it fell down so now I need the big glass instead of my pitcher so the situation I just described do you think it was my fault that it broke or it was Zena's we're not a hundred percent in agreement over whose fault it is quite yet when you didn't wash the dishes because we have a dishwasher washing dishes by hand is like so wasteful it wastes time it wastes water that wastes my will to live I've been saying we need two dishwashers one to store dirty dishes and one to like clean the dishes in and then you just switch them like every few days six cans of water that's like nothing right if you washed all the stitches by hand wouldn't it be way more that you use I will never wash a dish by hand yeah that's why I'm saying to use a dishwasher Zena was insisting she wanted to do it by hand for like the longest time and I told her you're wasting your time but she wanted to do it I don't know why hello Clayman the sink to dishwasher pad is the worst okay why does it even go in the sink in the first place someone explain this to me why would you ever put the sink at the dish in the sink this must have one of humanity's greatest lesson exactly everyone should have two it's not common to have a dishwasher okay but how can you how can you afford to not have a dishwasher think about it the time you spend washing dishes you could be spending making money it's very expensive to be poor yeah evidently I don't have space for it fair enough not everything is about money this one's about principle you washed him by hand out of principle this is not at all what I wanted I guess it kind of is what I wanted shit getting in a bus instead of walking I don't understand oh yeah something there's a lot of you and it's better true true honestly I used to make like $7,000 a year and I don't think my life has changed much since then I still just live like I make $7,000 a year no I'm in Canada now see what I used to do before I did this job with my pan I just didn't wash it I just bought a new pan every year think about all the time you save if you want to hate me for that one fair enough hello mario luigism 64 that's not advice don't pretend like I just gave you advice true true if you do it just because you like it that's fair enough but then you can't complain about it yeah but think about all the money I don't have to do that hello this puppy restream does it say restream on my stream please tell me it doesn't well I don't even drive so an expensive car wouldn't really do anything for me I don't know maybe I'm just weird with money I mean I definitely am weird with money I never buy anything it says turn your videos into live streams with restream hyperlink blocked wait where does it say that oh that's awful if it says that anywhere on my stream I might have to do that true buying is like a vanity thing almost feel like a lot of people buy because they just don't know what else to do to become happy you ever seen that picture where one guy has like a shelf full of funko pops and it says why am I not happy yet my description ah that sucks but I guess it's not that awful that looks beautiful this looks like shit this is uh boxing out something it's not supposed to look good can you believe we're like on the last two courses it's crazy you're going insane about the blue coin like the coin itself or the switch I've definitely seen on twitter like the analytics today went crazy 206 000 views oh my god you're going crazy over the blue coin switch but don't forget to shave your balls otherwise the woman will not like you no I was asking if it was about the blue coin or the switch itself that was ambiguous to me I mean I know you said about the blue coin but that like came out of nowhere it is doing numbers oh that's crazy I think we kind of struck gold with the format you know what I'm gonna make a note um for a video optimizing every mario 64 actor and then that would be like a whole video that can be like a four-hour video holy shit so there's a small bit of overdraw, but who gives a fuck, not me. Honestly I should just model one of these and then copy it over. Very nostalgic of the carnival dev era, the carnival level took so long, I know what you can't even imagine. So it's amazing how it doesn't have to shoot lightning and you can control the transaction to move on. I mean, yeah, it could be interesting. I'm not really looking for new power-ups though. Could you imagine if Shigeru Miyamoto was live streaming and people went in there and like suggested new power-ups to him? And he'd be like really respectful about it, he's like we appreciate your valuable fan push. Change the title? I did yes, correct. Thank you for the list of flying pigs in video games. Guy I don't know, at that moment it's so funny to me. Guys, I need you to rate how cringed isn't I? So, two days ago it was Halloween right and Zeyna was hoping for Trigger Treatise, nobody came, it was sad and all that but she wanted to give candy to the neighbor kids so we went over to the neighbor kids with our baby in hand. Now the neighbors, they had a babysitter at home and the neighbors weren't home. So there were the neighbors with their two young children babysitting them and us at the door with our baby in hand who was clearly too young to eat candy and they gave us candy. So it was like they thought we were trying to go trigger treating with our three month old. They thought we were like trying to get candy for free for ourselves or something. So how cringe was this interaction? How much aura did I lose? 100 aura? Dang, that's rough. So you put candy in your bag, you should have taken candy from yours and put it in the free market. We did! That's the crazy part. We went over there with candy to give to the children. But I guess they thought this was candy like we got before and they just gave us their candy. We're not here for the candy, we're here to drop off candy. And so now we just traded candy and okay, this is actually the stupidest part. I should have thought about this beforehand. So Zayna bought the really, really hot Takis. They're so hot that I can't eat them because it hurts and this is the candy she gave to the children. Are they going to think we like tried to kill their children? The reason I would say yes. The remaster of course to vanilla I never had it because I was not interested in making it There's a sailing the sand see there's a level from There's a lot of music from Nintendo games gritsy desert and super smash bros. Brawl That's what we're listening to right now What do you think of this for the central room I'm thinking in the middle we put a big statue that you can climb on I Never used SMBX no, but I've heard about it. I Just read out the file so I'm not doing it again And so shaving staircase Not sure I understand like a bunch of pencils shavers That doesn't really look like building material to me or something else here But no, I'm thinking of a statue to put in the middle What's a nice statue we can make out of cardboard I Can't one Yoshi That would be kind of a cool thing to put yeah, I Can make this as like a room, but I don't think that should be in the middle I Get which is really a really cool set piece, but in the middle, I think I want the statue and that you can climb on Or something maybe the staircase is the best idea Yeah, most edges are a little bit awkward to climb let's try to model it see what happens Without the time in the engine no, I Mean for graphics I kind of do but not for gameplay I Doesn't really a reason to support that Screw modifier easy. Okay. Let's try that And I make a plane first make it size 500 Screw oh Shit Thanks again I mean looking at the list is one thing but like remembering and understanding the list that's the impressive part I would say hmm now the problem is it doesn't I guess it doesn't matter it's only 120 triangles it's 120 triangles it's no problem 120 is like nothing especially in such a closed area here text suit it's okay people are making fun of how I pronounce texture all the time as well and I don't even know what I say wrong texture fellas help me out why is it not texture texture texture even worse they're making fun of how I say fuck I know it looks poofy right now but Biobak said it's gonna move it so I'm not worrying about it for now I have the house to myself for two whole days so you know how to pronounce pronunciation anymore that's basically perfect the hell is it texture it's texture no t-e-k-s-t texture k-s-t-c-h-a texture  now I can't land there because of good reasons you fucking hate modeling cranes you're just gonna delete the cranes honestly fair we can probably go without the cranes the cranes kind of sucked anyway there you can be on j again in this game oh my god walking up this is so fun I'm having fun walking up here oh this is so cool and you can do that too I like this a lot it's kind of weird like to think about that like you have an accent and that's going to be there your entire life and that's like your customization and you're stuck with it for like ever wait shit is that gonna be what speedrunners do all right shit it's difficult but it works come on it's not that difficult there we go oh my god I would hate if I had a british accent I don't have a nintendo police here I mean what are you gonna do fight me I would win I don't think anything would change if I was british I need a big mac because my bunny burns a lot of fuel you know okay so nintendo police like that were required to kill you for pirating super mario 64 they would do that but it didn't pirate mario 64 I have never played mario 64 illegally okay so now we need to make paths here and the paths connect and go back to the main areas as well and we want to do this mostly by ripping pieces from here if we can oh we also need to make the entrance here somehow shit forgot about that part we could just have the player fall into the spirit staircase here I think it'd be a pretty cool effect yeah okay you had the same idea by a mic nice nice nice so so I mean it's neat you made a power up but really I can't just add a power up to the game like that we have to be a little more thought out with it how long do you think this game will be up before nintendo takes it down so it's the opposite of that worms fortress remake that they made in mario galaxy 2 because that worms fortress remake is just one guy not realizing he needs to not press the guitar sometimes  with two days I think like a week is realistic the last time I made a big hack I uploaded it with a copyright free trailer as well like right next to it so maybe I do that or maybe I upload the copyright free trailer like right after it or something I have to think about it still so so I don't know if Nintendo really would want to kill me though that for me honestly that that's like a toss-up still I think there's a chance they might just leave me alone I mean when you consider how old mario 64 is at this point come on you know what annoys me the most already I know exactly that like when I release it and there is a copyright take down there's gonna be so many people going like wow should have not told people about the game well it's what you get for modifying a nintendo game you knew this was gonna happen like being all smug and shit and it's like yes I knew this was going to happen but I didn't know it was going to happen the fuck is your point it still sucks it was a calculated risk I still wanted to do it so it's like going up to someone who ate mcdonald's once and being like well I mean yeah you got a heart attack but like you know you knew the risk you were taking it's like shouldn't have eaten mcdonald's no way no because like nintendo actually took a remade some of the ideas I had my romex if you look at tears of the kingdom which came out right after the missing link came out they added a time reversal just like a missing link that's crazy that they actually cared about that if I was nintendo I would 100% ignore that okay but like the concept of a flying type eevee is so un such an unoriginal thought that there's no way that they would have scrapped it because a fan would have made them then that's no way  oh okay the design for the official one was too close to a fan design that's fair yeah I can see that Wait, so they were trying to look like fan designs? Or could it be that they thought the Japanese designer for the flying type EV stole from the fans? Either way, that does sound really limiting if you want to be like living your life like that. I wouldn't if I was Nintendo, I would say fuck you and taking this design. What you gonna do, sue me, I'm Nintendo. I mean it would kill my views and stuff and it would stop the game from like becoming more famous, so that's the part that would suck. So it wouldn't matter for me, but it wouldn't really matter for any players. Maybe you really should be shaving your bald smile back, maybe Jeff Bezos is trying to tell you something. Keep in mind, Jeff Bezos knows probably more about the people in your life than you do. Should we maybe label these? I'm thinking three or four instant warps. Let me do this in paint, okay. So we got first floor, second floor, third floor. So what do we need to give away? We have six total connected paths. We can have some of them be branching out into other paths as well. So like one of them could go into two different ones. We could have something like so and so. And then, I don't know, I'm just making random connections here. Wait, it doesn't even matter. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It doesn't matter. The fact that it doesn't matter is crazy, actually. Let me think about this some more. I need to think about what I need to think about. Let's get them connected like this. Mario might come to Fortnite. He won't. I don't understand. Yeah, no way Nintendo would allow that. They even shut down Shotgun Mario. Nintendo making a music app is concerning. They might just take down more music now. Okay, let's think about this. So we can put the instant warps anywhere we want. That's huge. If we have four instant warps and six total tunnels, it's kind of fucked. But it works. It kind of is nice that it's fucked, you know what I mean? And then we have one, two, three, four normal tunnels and two double tunnels. That doesn't make any sense. How is that possible? Four double tunnels is eight entrances. Two double tunnels should be six entrances. We have 14 entrances. Okay. Yeah, that would be 12 tunnels or 12 entrances total. So six tunnels. One, two, three. Oh, wait. Three normal tunnels, two double tunnels, one total of tunnels. I did play the AI Minecraft. This is actually a crazy thing on Twitter as well. People are like, oh, this is just garbage. This is just an asset flip of Minecraft. We all knew I could recreate Minecraft if you just ripped the assets. And it's like, that's not what this is. Why is everyone acting like this is a Minecraft asset flip reprogrammed in like a Java AI? It's like making a game purely run on neural networks. That's what it is. And it's a cool tag. I mean, it's useless right now, but it's cool that you can do it. It's like flying to the moon. Like it's useless, but it's cool. You can do it. If it's four linked tunnels plus four unlinked tunnels. Well, there would be four instant warps here. And the instant warps can also be in the double tunnels, right? So it's like crazy. It's Minecraft, let's play video asset flip. Because we're planning Yoshi party. Yeah, I think some structure like this could work. We can literally just make up bullshit and it will be fine. But I think I'm going with this here. I was imagining this is three, this is two, this is one. So this tunnel should go from up here, down here. That should be fine. I don't think it crosses any wires. Then we have this tunnel going down here. And down here. That's not crossing any wires. Good, good, good, good, good. Then we have this tunnel here going to this side. Okay. Then we'll need an instant warp. I will make note. We have this tunnel here going here and here. That's good. Doesn't need an instant warp. Sucks ass though, I hate it. If they made a machine that killed orphans in new and exciting ways, it would be technically impressive. But also, why are you doing this? I mean, it's cool to prove you can do it, right? Obviously killing infants is like bad. But like making a useless machine is like neutral, right? I think that's why I disagree on this equivalence. So going from the bottom of two to the right side of one should be fine. All right, I think this all works. Okay, no, just proving you can do it if you don't actually do it, but like just like mathematically proving that you can do it doesn't make you a bad person. This is obviously a stepping stone to putting AI in more games. Yeah, I think that's fine. I can kind of see it. So you're saying it's like a slippery slope, that like because this exists, you're working towards something that is bad and that we need to prevent, basically? Isn't it impressive? Machines kill people all the time. Well, I mean, killing a toddler is not supposed to be impressive here. Yeah, I can see it being about video generation. Oh God, people are going to use this for porn. That's going to be like the main thing people use it for, just like image generation. Almost every generation thing is like being used for just generating cheap porn. Honestly, maybe that's not such a bad thing, because like you don't need real actors anymore and that's kind of like damaging to them, right? I'm just making the parts for the orphan killing machine. I can see the concern now, yeah. Hmm, which part of this? Probably this part here. Well, who knows how long they're going to be garbage. I mean, with AI advancing, the data sets you need are going to get smaller and smaller. At least that should be the goal, or one of the goals. Hmm. You know what I hate the most? So I use this text editor to do things, right? Let me make this full screen. So let's say a video about Mario 64. And the worst part is you can just ask AI and it just keeps popping up. Write my scripts. I hate this. It's just going to write random garbage. Why did they add AI to Notepad? That really is the one place that doesn't need it. And I sometimes accidentally click it, just when I like highlight a word, and just starts writing garbage onto my script. God, I really want to make another brass essay. Like I really, really want to. But I already have a funnier idea than that for April Fools. If I was fine just being like a YouTube slop content creator, then that's what I would do. Hey, Thara, that is absolutely what I would do. Waiting for AI and Blender. So we get a little slidey here. And then we do want to connect this to one. So we do have to connect the two right here in the end. The AI situation is a little bizarre to me. It seems very evident to me that no one wants it, but somehow it keeps being added to things. Like, especially the Notepad app there really doesn't need AI. It has to be something like they're hoping for,  that they become the next best thing. And like the next big thing that becomes like super popular and famous, and that everyone will use them. So they're just throwing AI into everything, even if it is completely nonsensical to everyone. Like surely no one thinks, oh, this will be helpful. They all think maybe there is a chance that people will use this all of a sudden. And then we have the entire user base, right? So I'm not attracting venture capital. You think so? I don't know if that makes sense. People act like investors are like completely stupid. And out of touch, and sure, they may be out of touch, but like. If they were that wrong, then like,  they would lose their capital fast. They are completely stupid. Oh, we'll definitely get AI for instance, no doubt about that one. I feel like 90% of when people advertise as like integrated AI, it's just Dolly and Chachabitty anyway. Right. I feel like it's actually stupid retail investors. Hello, Dawn. So there need to be one or two red coins per path. If we have one per connect path and then two per double path, I think we're perfect. And I'll just take this path here. It's not a very interesting path, but it fits the shape, I guess. This is the red coin area, correct. 2025, we're probably going to finish all the main content in 2025, but there's still beta left. Testing and bug fixing to be done keep in mind this is like quest 14 so like the main I mean I do have had people test individual levels but the official playlist has not started yet using blend as a level editor for your engine yep there's this a script called fast 64 and exports all of this to n64 formats so that's how I transfer the there you go me dancing this one in turn them into how many courses when he gets like four which you know it's not a lot but it's still for one level it's a fair bit I mean this we have to think about it is the first level this is going to be your first impression of the game it has to be absolute peak the first time was not peak and you got the game for free this is actually important we're getting this game for free so if the first level is not good you're not invested right the fact that this game doesn't cost money in a way that's really bad news for us if you have a paid video game you have an investment I think it's funny at this point people are like suggesting new improvements to course one in the comments and it's like please we've done enough I think the level is great now it doesn't need even more stuff but I'm not making a completely different theme about Stella at least make it about okay so we need more options I need an option for the vintage Goomba please I'm so glad I'm not the only one that has to suffer for that now just like you're suffering with me we work went from 1 million seed rounds to 47 blending argon to zero who's we work it sounds like a crypto coin not based off the name but based off the market development I just had a thought wait has anyone said this before rip the points are just multi-level marketing for the boys think about it has anyone said this before if not that's a banger tweet it's definitely come up before them I thought I invented something just now bummer what about nfts yeah I can see how that could be it's weird nfts disappeared but like cripple didn't I would expect them to like leave at night it seems pretty normal so tired of crypto nft discussions fair enough honestly we forgot something needs to be an exit to the main area here it shouldn't be that hard to head back but still sucks so I'm just gonna find where trust me bro I don't like that one I think that should be a legitimate exit so true one but true that's just that's not what people colloquially mean when they say nfts when people say nfts colloquially what they mean is um the images that you upload online and then you claim you own the image when you own like a link to the image or something whatever I don't know how it works but you know what I mean they mean these auto-generated pictures not a ledger history of ownership so that works so definitely need to make this one climbable wait did I connect to the second floor and not the first one I did how how did I make that mistake was I supposed to no you know what this is fine I just need to change how this works a little bit so like so so yeah I think I like this concept a lot more it's like a lot more reasonable it's still interesting but like not nearly as prone to just being awful so why is it trying to open this with notepad it's a png file that is crazy okay next is a double entrance this double entrance goes to both of these ones below it it's kind of like the lsd pit but not really the lsd pit was a very distinct idea in my opinion so which one of these structures is well suited for something more vertical so maybe this whole thing here yeah the cave level is gated it's like the last impact part I will agree with that one so I don't even know what that is what is the tv tropes page what do you do on it yeah of course all the buses are custom the idea of reusing a vanilla bar 64 bus seems like insane to me so all the tropes in a piece of media convincing wall of doom I don't understand that's an ice person amazing technicolor battlefields so I don't understand any of this oh my god there's so much to who wrote all this that's crazy it's cool that someone did all that but like what the fuck so this is one of those double tunnels so you're going to be able to enter it from here and I'm thinking the ceiling should be here as well and then there should be like an instant warp at the end same thing on the stage this stage is a whole level made out of cardboard and it has different biomes so there's like a snow section a castle section stuff like that and this right here is the pyramid section of the cardboard level so your name I've been watching the nier anime recently over the last two days and I think it's really funny I like it anime did something good for once beer not beer so god so this is not a very good song to bench to do so it's a banger but it's not what you want to listen to when you listen Gifting like 300 pounds doesn't give me the energy and this gives me adventure. Maybe if I make those staircases go down instead of up it could work. But if it fringes on this, what if we go like this, yeah that could work. Miss anything? You're always gonna miss something exciting whenever you look away from your screen in this stream. We're doing so many exciting things. The baby came down to the basement instead of benchy220. Unfortunately for you, Zena is out for the weekend. With the baby. So impossible. You may ask, how did I refill my pitcher so quickly? I will tell you, I did not dunk it in the aquarium just to drink out of the aquarium. He will never find out how I did that. I will keep that a secret until someone can figure out what I'm doing. Oh the piss pitcher, I see what you mean. Unfortunately wrong, we're not using a piss pitcher. Interesting theory though. We can probably cull all these pathways here and then make it so that if the camera is looking at the region with the pathway it's being rendered. Wait, we can just use F3D's build and culling for most of it and then the insides are like separately. Yeah you just fill, see okay this is the craziest optimization what you do. You go to the faucet in the bathtub and you turn it on drip. So the entire day it's dripping. And you measure it out, you want to have like around 100 milliliters an hour. And then this solves two issues. One, you'll never have to pour water again. Two, you'll never have to think about if you've drank enough water during the day again. And then you just fill your pitcher whenever. There's a bunch of pitchers. He doesn't have to get up. That would be a crazy strategy, just like having 15 pitches here. Swapping them out when I need to. Like a hamster. I don't like the prospect of being a hamster. Why N60 cameras are cringe? Like is it a code or harder thing? I don't know what you mean. Hello Albie. I will make graphics in 2013. Good graphics were invented by me in 2013, clearly. Oh, I like the abyss sections. We definitely need some of those. Did we put one here? Wait, wrong part. We could put an abyss section here. It would connect those two. Let's do it. Let's pick this section here. Oh, I like this section. I've seen something where someone just took like a screenshot of a movie. It's like, this looked so good. Yeah, but my uncle, he works in film and he said, we forgot how to do this. That's the situation with Magic Wand too. So yes, our technology regressed. We can't do this anymore. Do you guys know what's crazy? The Mr. Me situation. It's crazy. All those YouTube videos, just like, God, I hate YouTube videos. I hate that that's what YouTube has become, you know. All the engagement farming with nonsense, meaningless soap opera content about other YouTube creators. There are creators out there whose entire existence is just founded on talking about other creators. This is not the natural order that shouldn't exist. You shouldn't be famous for being famous. You know what I mean? Wet judgmental. I've said this before. I should just be moist critical, but instead of like averaging the opinion on Reddit about like current topics, I averaged the opinion on Reddit about things related to the N64 and gaming. I think it could work. I just have to AI generate like a few wet judgmental jokes in there. I don't know. What can we make jokes about? Surely like we can use the same shit, right? It can't be that hard to come up with those jokes. I bet Biobak can write like five in two minutes. He's probably typing out the first three. I'd have to pay him to like write my most critical bits for me. I feel the X situation is crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like that. That's just a combination of guys complaining. Interesting concept. Okay. I come from underperforms. GCC woke. GCC broke. It's GCC book. I don't actually know. I never asked the company what their opinion on trans rights is. Does anyone know the official GCC stands on trans rights? You know, in Germany fucking sucks. I'm glad I'm out of there. To be honest, I'm just like an Android built for making games. That's my point on this planet. Honestly, that's not a terrible idea. I feel like just because I'm talking about it, people would like investigate it. They are. Be friendly and patient. GCC has gone broke. Be kind to others. It's over. Nintendo music, our playlist. It is a Nintendo music playlist. There's a relaxing Nintendo playlist. To listen to the music on YouTube today. Will I be in trouble here? It's the question. I'll just like change for the kids. I'll change this a fair bit. It changes not as much as when you get a new job, but it changes more than when you break your small job. 50 level in total. But for me, as my wife is mainly caring for the child, she's a stay at home mom. So for me, it was just work before and it's mostly just work after. So it's going to have been a much, much bigger change for her. And for me, the Pokemon booster pack opening up, I did not. Dude, I actually love opening booster packs. If I'm ever a billionaire, you will see me opening Pokemon booster packs. Mewtwo X. I'm actually one of the few people that actually understand how the Pokemon trading card game works. Fun fact. And I think I'm good at it too. Poor Biobak. All he wanted to talk about was Pokemon cards and now he has to shave his balls again. Wait, so is it just an app where you can open packs and then you just have the cards in your collection and you can like pay real money to get packs faster? Is that how it works? Got the God pack on day one. Let's see. I can't read this. Alakazam X only has 138 HP. Oh wait, that's a fully evolved Alakazam. Not an X. All right, I see. Rapidash sucks. Midsham, wait, Midsham is also terrible. Wait, these are all terrible. You're gonna lose with those cards. For my birthday, Xena got me two Pokemon starter decks. And the cards are like way stronger. This is the card we have. That's like so much stronger than the cards you have there. The hell? What's with the power level? They dumbed down the combat for the app. Midsham has more HP than Alajar. Well, that makes sense because it's a three-stage evolution, right? So getting it out is really difficult. But why are these cards so weak compared to the other cards, the ones I have? That's what's concerning to me. Isn't that weird? Am I alone here?  Their pretty counts as shit and ugly counts as OP. I was also one of the kids that never learned how the game worked. And just connected the guards because I wanted to have all the guards but now I understand how the game works I want two boosters a day for free and you open the old boosters or just like the new ones because I'm not really interested in the new ones but I do like the old ones this is actually a top-secret case look at this this is this is my Mew, this is my Machamp, this is a Hypno, we got we got a Mewtwo, we got we got a Dragonite, you see this is a Blastoise, a holo Blastoise, we got of course I have a Charizard, I got all of them, you don't see anything, I hope it was just off-camera all right see here's my Blastoise and let me find my Charizard too, there's my Mewtwo and then then then then then where's my Charizard? my Charizard, you see that? Lurak if it was still off-camera, you've got no way look I have like two minutes of stream delay okay I'll get my Charizard out one more time Charizard, you seeing it? Mint condition? it's not first edition unfortunately isn't that cool I have all 151 Pokemon I fed them for a long time before they were worth anything I remember I got a Charizard card for one of my birthdays when I was like six or seven years old they were like ten euros back then I remember when I was a very small kid I was six years old and my teachers thought I was a little bit really dumb and they had me take an intelligence test and they told me if I do well on the test they would give me like a good Pokemon card and they gave me a Lugia so I must have done really fucking well on the test I accidentally fused this somehow wait what's going on here oh I see attached to the wrong end when I was a kid to make custom Pokemon cards and most of them were OP shitposts I knew there was a child in my elementary school who had an Aerodactyl like 2500 HP I bet it was like that I better not have been you this has some camera issues this is way too tight space-wise not good hello I'll be mentioned from Twitch I am Arzee from Twitch and YouTube playing the new Mario & Luigi game I don't know if the future is vast things may happen I don't know what a watch puppy channel is so like a channel dedicated to watching a big event I don't have any thoughts on that concept honestly there isn't many games that you could really excite me for here if they announced like another Zelda game in the style of Majora's Mask specifically Majora's Mask not Ocarina of Time or Twilight Princess then I'm excited I've recently decided that Majora's Mask is the true Zelda game by far I actually have a hot take Twilight Princess to me it feels competently made but very rushed I think looking at the game I can just tell that many things were rushed what's the difference in style between Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask well Ocarina of Time doesn't have Majora's Mask weird time system but that's not even necessarily what I'm talking about Majora's Mask you only have four dungeons but roughly the same playtime and that is because in Majora's Mask it's not just so much about doing the dungeons themselves it's about the journey to get into the dungeon whereas in Ocarina of Time the game is mostly about the dungeons after the first three dungeons you just go bam bam bam bam you are everywhere the first three dungeons in Ocarina of Time are kind of like Majora's Mask I like those a lot but then after that that's a big big fall off for me unlike in Majora's Mask where the entire game is like that yeah Majora's Mask is about the world that's a good way to put it which one should you play first the Zelda games exist on a wide spectrum of like serving player interest so without really knowing much about you it's very hard to recommend anything well yeah that's the first three dungeons cream teamer but after that not really after that it's just dungeon dungeon dungeon Majora's Mask does the N64 style thing of just puking a rainbow over the entire level which works very well on the N64 that's fair Majora's Mask's beginning is pretty hard to get through yeah Breath of the Wild's world is not nearly as interesting as Majora's Mask's for me I just felt nervous you'd run out of time I can see something like that being a drill breaker yeah you kind of got filtered before you got to the actual game then which is unfortunate makes sense to the point of Breath of the Wild it is a very different style if you've come there for like the classic Zelda experience obviously you'd be disappointed wait what was that landing animation oh nothing maybe I'm just crazy oh yeah have you seen my new Mario model do you see the difference I added vertex colors to him I realized I can use the blend mode and set cycle 1 alpha to just shade color and effectively vertex color him that way by lerping into black isn't that cool look at his shoes I added a shine to him with an additive blender now his shoes have a little shine and the best part is it's like 100 free of cost he's always been like that cream teamer I don't know why Mario is like that the camera there is too tight and the camera is really an issue in this area I guess it's fine to turn this into a smaller jump if it means the camera is good or not awful when we work to make Mario's eyes like he's looking at points of interest you'd need different eye textures for that Glava I don't know that much about Glava unfortunately I ripped some models or UD ripped some models from Glava and we put them into Mario 64 though if that's something you're interested in okay let's check the camera again oh also something I've been thinking about doing on Twitter water Wednesday every Wednesday I take one N64 game I go through them in chronological order and I analyze the water in it and drink the water because I found with RT64 you can look at combined modes and blend modes from different waters in N64 games so it's actually like a pretty reasonable thing to do plus it lets me like look at how other N64 developers made their games so it might even be useful also yes it is infinite content Whopper Wednesday every day I go to Burger King and eat a Whopper the camera will be a whole lot less bad once we have the proper camera collision flags on here so the issues you saw are not really issues make it into a video the thumbnail will be you with a picture of water and the water with the picture that could work so that's one way people might reasonably do this another way they might reasonably do this is rotate the camera like this would they be able to do something like that though or would they just do that and fail hmm I think we can make people long jump there that's fine this goes 14 still doesn't say no water no I would just skip them I'm not dedicating a Wednesday to saying no water I'm not doing sexy side of that either okay so we got the first two tunnels done that's um the first third of this done no that was fast one two three four five six seven eight eight out of twelve so either way I'm done for today and I will see you guys in the next stream which I don't know when that is possibly on Tuesday but no guarantee so until then bye bye
