you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you what is this maze this is the mind shift it's part of the overworld kind of hello sarah hello avi i'm glad that's identifiable as a maze though because that was kind of the vision for those you Hello savory, hello silver burp We are working on the overworld the entrance to part eight You Yeah, it's definitely a maze or it's definitely very maze like looking which is good We want this to feel like a maze but not to actually play like a maze if that makes sense You When the game loves to plan on making a media available on the ssbngs for content creators playing it I have never heard of a media kit. What does that mean? You I mean I can imagine what it means from the words involved but like, you know, like actually what is in there? You We have a new beta overworld Hello biome back Look at this new beta overworld Oh This looks so, uh test level You know what I mean, it's like when you look at a game and you find like a secret test level This is what they look like I'm, kind of happy. It just naturally turned out this way There's the goomba pit. Here's the occlusion plane You Of course is that's where the retro section is the power ups and the side levels I might leave it in for the data miners Oh Are we doing any yoshi shopping today Yoshi shopping yoshi shocking. Oh, no, I think they are still free to move Yeah, like our dark room, I mean it literally becomes pitch black He just dies at the end well I was gonna put a decal here And then this is the exit But we need a character to move to star i'm not 100 sure on what that is yet Oh, I see Remember the old days when walking through a warp would make mario disappear. I fixed this I saved mario 64. If your mario 64 rom hack includes mario disappearing, then I disagree I remember that khaki buff and I think I have to change that mechanic because the way it's implemented looks a little bit janky I think what we actually have to do is just keep simulating mario's movement But lock his input direction to full forward or something like that So What's he mentioning something like this at the ends If you're doing boos there could be a switch at the end that opens the path and the light coming Hmm Maybe Okay, first of all, we need an ost something to listen to I don't know what happened to rom hacking. I don't care Not my monkey not my circus type situation So Pikmin ost honestly, that's a good idea If he keeps dodging you I would need to add a new tunnel so you can keep going in a circle at the end So I I don't really want to do that I was thinking more like a friendly character A ghost yoshi Would a ghost yoshi help you Oh god, these all look terrible That's actually pretty cute So Welcome to another round of try to spot all the deviant heart fetish art whenever kate uses google images Don't try to spot the deviant art There goes actually I have a okay what would the tweak be The AI one I don't see an AI one Oh, no, have I become a boomer and now I can't tell AI out anymore I actually don't see AI here at the top. Is this AI? Ah, it looks kind of AI, yeah I Suppose that might be So at the end we need to put the door here that only goes down after you collect the star True the hands do look a little fucked up So I'm not really someone that actively looks for AI so I wouldn't really notice So Me when all my pigments go home Except for one that I missed that is broadly being eaten by wild creatures You're done level and you don't see the yoshi straight away You just see the illuminated path in the distance and every time you get close the yoshi moves to the next map very fast You never actually see him You'll get him at the end when he arrives when he talks to you. Maybe it's just mischievous Hmm yes, I do like that That sounds like a pretty easy tweak So It should just disappear at the end no text box, I think no text box is a better vibe for this So Who dares write me at this time Oh akira is done with the playtest So Nice I will watch that later That's true by the way, I agree And then at the end the yoshi just disappears without ever revealing himself, I think that'd be pretty cute So Let me parameterize this So Maybe we crank up the distance starting to 2000 So All right, zaina, bye-bye Yeah, first place or nothing if you don't get first place don't bother coming back home Okay, you can kind of see him a little bit there And here too Is it fine if you can like catch glimpses of him like that I think it's fine, but we can also still increase this Make the distance target a little higher And the fade range as well That's a glimpse Yeah, that's I think that's great So Yes, it's at the end I will fade them out of course You said you have a model already for a ghost yoshi biomech Let's put it in right away So Is it what The fuck why did I read that did zaina say that You What the fuck my brain backed out So Hmm Let's hear something like a ghost yoshi, maybe Okay. Um Let's just design a ghost yoshi then fuck it shouldn't take long. We can just base it off the yoshi model. We already have Hello selton Also guys i'm gonna be honest if they don't fix the youtube studio where you have to lock yourself in Soon i'm going to lose my mind. I'm just going to stop using youtube studio. I would stop reading any comments you guys post It's part five and after this you get to part eight Um Vibe check so you get to part eight here It's mixing me bump what if he's like fully asleep until you get some amount of stars And then slowly like maybe at like 30 stars you can get in just a random star barrier, which is like a time barrier I think that's that's a good idea. Oh, yes What's the story behind ghost yoshi He fell down before He's the latest victim So I just made that up. I don't know if that's official or yet the The rule is still out on that one I also notice we are quite tight on ram in the main level or in the overworld So we might actually have to make more side levels out of stuff like the lighthouse But it shouldn't be a big deal He was seriously growing transparent fruit that was growing on the superivity, but then he was crushed by a falling boulder and dust Actually run out of course ids yes Hello Do Honestly, we don't need any complicated tricks here. We put penis music in Pikmin. Hey, there we go. I'm thinking he should be like a light cyan Yoshi. This should roughly be his color. Light cyan, but yellow light. To do Fresnel. I don't know what Fresnel is. You know what? I will let you handle that Fresnel stuff if you want. Spaghettimolo, edges are sharp and blender actually impact the way it's rendered on N64. Yes. But these are UV seams, I think. Oh no, those were actually sharps. The sharp splits the nobles, so they're not smooth, so you actually get sharp edges. Why can I not rotate it this way? What the fuck? Its rotations are locked. How is this going on? What the fuck? There we go. That was weird. I think that makes them look very ghostly. It's a bruh, bruh, why are you calling him bruh? Why is that bruhs? Wow, this looks fucked up. Wait, is this supposed to go across his whole body? Is that what Yoshi looks like? The eternal glow factor, I see, I see. Glow command doesn't know where Yoshi's body stripe goes, immediately loses 15,000 subscribers. Honestly, that's realistic. If I went on YouTube and I said I don't know where Yoshi's body stripe goes, I might actually lose 15,000 subscribers. Like if I uploaded a whole video and it was just me saying that. Yeah, it's over. That should work. Who said Restream.io Wait, are you getting messages from Restream.io? What the fuck just happened? That was scary. Alright, what do you think of Ghost Yoshi? I think his arms are a little long. Have you guys seen the videos of the cats that's like Google Earth zooms in and then the cat goes. That's what this reminds me of. Will he be transparent? Yes. I will send him after you, Biomech. There we go, Ghost Yoshi. Alright, here we go. His pupil color. Oh, that's not so easy because of the textures used. I can't believe no one talked about the videos I just talked about. You guys haven't seen it at all? That's crazy. You cannot have, I don't know what I was explaining. Dang. You missed the best AI-generated cat meme of all time. Have you seen the video of Mario running from police? How did he escape into our realm? Mario in Vice City. You guys remember that video from fucking 16 years ago? The stupid claymations? That's good old 2009 YouTube. The 20s. Or the 0s. Okay, while we wait for that, we can make a door that opens in the end. As soon as you have the star. Good old 1900s YouTube. True. I used to think for a second if YouTube existed at that point, but no. That's like just a couple years too late. You know what? Just to make things not buggy when someone goes really fast. How old were you when your parents let you browse unrestricted through the internet? 13? 14 maybe? Or well, what do you mean by unrestricted? Because I still had a time limit at that age. I think the time limit went away when I was like maybe 18. I was on about like one hour of PC a day. Or actually, I think it went away when I was around 17, because that's when I started ROM hacking. Because then I was like, yeah, I'm actually working on stuff on my computer. Like I'm not just playing video games. And they were like, okay, fine, you can spend more time on the computer. At homework, how could you work on the time limit? Well, when I was that age, homework wasn't on the computer. Besides, there's no way I ever spent an hour a day on homework. The most I ever spent on homework in like one day was maybe 40 minutes. And that's because of Latin classes. The Latin homework I had was always so much compared to everything else. I don't know if I just sucked at Latin, but Latin was rough. They'd always give us probably like maybe 30-ish sentences in Latin to translate. And they were like difficult sentences from like big Caesar speeches and stuff. I don't know, maybe it was the teacher. I know that in my Latin class though, except for a very few people, no one did their homework, because it was so much. Yoshi has been expedited. Let's see what you got for me. What the fuck? What did you do? Change color alpha. Oh, I see. Oh, we do need the multiplication of color alpha. That looks crazy though. Yeah, he looks pretty great. That's a cool effect. Okay, I see. Okay. Okay, I don't know why makeCyclic doesn't work. But that should be fine. HasScale is not defined? HasScale not defined. Fucking, I'm gonna lose it. What is that even supposed to mean HasScale? Okay. Is it in the geo layout? It's something in the geo layout. Why are these all custom comments? What? When did that happen? Did you do that? Okay, apparently it was the custom comments that someone got put into that. I didn't even know that was a beat jump, I just know. Nice. Yes, we will have this arrow from now on, every time we export anything from class 64. And I don't know why. Seems to work on other repos. What? What? I am so confused by this. Neither one of these two works. I think something's wrong with our build system. Yes. I'm not good enough to make a file. Okay. What the fuck is this thing up here? This is complete nonsense. All of these 07s. I can't tell if the error here is that the files are linked wrong or that it's not even trying to build the stuff in the folder of the level. No rule to make targets. Levels, mineshaft, ghost Yoshi. Needed by MarioAnimData? Why is this needed by MarioAnimData? What the fuck? Hello there, Lord Matt. What did we do to MarioAnimData that this would be required? That sounds insane. Is it maybe Alphartility's... Alphartility's tool for... Contagions. Hmm. I don't think he hardcoded the level names in here. Yeah, I'm actually out of ideas. But this could possibly just be wrong. Are we unable to do animations at all right now with the extra courses? What's the overwolf? Sure. Yes. Let me try to delete the animations, see if that works better. Something bizarre is going on. Doesn't work either. GhostYoshiModel.Inc. So I just think we're running R2-D2. No idea. Okay, I don't think it's R2's tool then. If the model just doesn't build. How's there no such file in the directory? How can this be? It's right here. Oh, I see. I'm so upset. I blame Lila's Fast64 update. It made it so that the paths are no longer correct. And I think that might have been the whole issue and not anything with the build file. This is what we need. I mean it's a good change, it just sucks that it doesn't work for me. There we go. Redefinition of Ghost Yoshi. R2. Where else is it? Apparently it exists twice. Where is it being redefined? Oh. So we hack them twice somehow. That makes sense. More issues. See this is why assembly hacking is nice, you don't have to deal with this bullshit. No rule to make target levels mineshaft.yoshi.anim.anim.idle. Needed by MarioAnimData. What? This doesn't even exist. Assets. Assets. MarioAnimData.c. Huh? Okay so what's going on is that MarioAnimData.c is a file that is dynamically generated by the build and build time. Something about this file is cursed. What if I just rename it and delete this whole thing? What happens then? Ghostidle.inc Maybe it's the .001 in the filename that just doesn't work somehow. Now it works! Now Mario is not trying to use Yoshi's animation because there was a 001 in the filename. Or is space in the filename? There is some bug in author's tool. Anyway we got it working now so I am happy with this. It's fine. We can work with this. Everything will be fine. Let's take a look at him in game. See if it looks good. Oops. We need a gate at the end. So this gate opens and then you can leave. That's after you get the star. Dude and then we finished the whole star on stream today. Wouldn't that be sick? You cheat by being in our stream? Fair enough. I did cheat. Dude I am actually really happy with the system for this. It's so easy to use and it looks decent. And it's somewhat cheap to render as well. Okay maybe not. But it works. Wait what the fuck is this texture? And then we get to import the bomb. And the bomb looks so funny I am looking forward to it. I am thinking maybe tomorrow for my birthday we can do a big birthday stream. And then we can get a lot of stuff done. And I know I have said this before but I am saying it again. So everyone knows that tomorrow is my birthday party. And everyone is invited. Except the stinky kids. The stinky kids are not invited. It's important. It's GTM. Yes I will just warp. Okay here is the thing. I would love to play Agrabah's Mario Adventure 2. It looks super cool. And maybe I want to play it. But also I already know I am just going to get upset at Mario's movement again. And I don't want to have a bad time with this game. So maybe it's a bad idea to stream that game. We see you do a bench press PR for your birthday. I am not in PR shape right now. I had an injury here. Well not here. On the back of my triceps. So I couldn't actually do bench for a bit. Which sucks. I am going to go get some water. Be right back. I am going to go get some water. Be right back. Wrong headphones. I am going to go get some water. She comes actually at least for flowers. It might be. Maybe I am like a flower. Take care of me and I will flourish. Do you want something with a shot in the shoulder please? I am like a flower. What do you mean? Just give him a very transparent shadow. Six four zero one. That's just too big. My daughter is starting to understand the first few words of English. And it's pretty funny. I guess it's actually not funny. Never mind. It's only funny to me because I am her dad. Do I have to? It's very fun. I can't tell how serious you are. Because on one hand I can imagine you kind of like the vibe. On the other hand you put three smileys and the game doesn't look very fun. You did it. It was 50% fun. Okay that sounds about right. That's in line with what my expectations were. Okay. I feel like I am playing a forbidden build of the game and the other half is maybe just because he was whining. Sounds about right. I feel like we could pull off something like the 3.3.1.3 very easily. I feel like we could make a level of that quality in like, I don't know, like 3 hours, 4 hours top. Actually less than that. But you just have to mash it together and then use vanilla textures. The fact that you can just use vanilla textures really is what will make the workflow so much faster. And it's so low quality too. Right? Why am I not dying? Hmm. I didn't set the model ID? I didn't export the level. I did not hit the extra level button. It says there's no audio and sound in your measurements. Uh, you mean here? The audio is the RSP and the sound is the CPU. Oh, he's right there. And when through the door. That makes sense. He moves constantly. I agree that the way he moved just now was too difficult. Non headphone mode already has 3D audio. Oh, I know why. Maybe? I did something weird here. Let's do this differently. Doing it around the corner is a little difficult but I will make him wait like a couple of units in front of you. That was a mistake here. Oh, you moved the audio processor too to improve performance? What? How did you get that idea? I don't remove any fidelity. Okay, he fucking jolted out. What the hell? That was difficult. Oops. I need to make Mario actually look forward when you spawn. Or the camera rather. I need to stop using fast forward like that. He does this corner so fast that it's impossible to catch up. Interesting. Maybe we need to reduce the base velocity a lot. And maybe also the distance target. It's hard to know which way he goes. Hopefully that's slightly improved now. Honestly, this one's easy, right? What? What am I even doing? How did this work at all? This should not have worked at all, not even close. Oh, like it could be coming from the right. I see what you mean. Okay. Let's give him animations and actually use this. Oh, I see. This is also an issue. Oh, I see. Okay. Okay, quite a few issues here that are all easy to fix. He changed his colors. I can tell. This is not the blue I put in. At least I'm pretty sure. Maybe I'm wrong. Okay. Okay. Hi, have a nice day. Wait, that sounds like you're both saying goodbye and hello. Actually, let's remove that. Now we should have a perfect Yoshi. After we externalize this function here. I think we have all the puzzle pieces together now. So you can have an ice... All right, the big ice cap stream tomorrow. Hello means hello and goodbye. Interesting. Translated into English literally. You are allowed to say a full sentence. Yo, why the fuck is he purple? Who made my Yoshi purple? Yo. Apparently we do not have all the puzzle pieces together. And why he purple? I've read this before. What does it mean? Oh my god. What do I... Okay. Okay. The bone name will be... Ah! And I will fix the issue. I hope. I agree. But I haven't really figured out a good solution yet. I was thinking maybe we just move the camera lower. That's cool. You should not get the option to leave. Hello, Eggnog. Looks like we have to follow the Yoshi. I'm a bit worried about that too. But the thing is, the slower you are, the slower the Yoshi goes. So however fast I'm going, you won't have to be going that fast. But we can make it even easier just by a little bit. Let's think about a solution to the ceiling issue. Is this a valid solution? Just scale the whole thing up by a little bit? It might actually be the solution. That's what you would have done? I see. I mean, it is the cheapest, easiest solution, so... I mean, it doesn't hurt to try. He's pretty easy to follow, I would say. And then this has to go back to the next overworld. And then the level is finished. And that has to stop after... Ah! Maybe that has to stop after you collect the star. We can increase this a little bit. This wasn't quite high enough anymore. Okay. That's good. Time to make the warp. Time to open our big overworld again. One and a half hours into the overworld stream, we opened the overworld. Gonna take a while. I don't have a playlist. It's just YouTube autoplay. How many gigabytes does the overworld weight plan for? It's like 15 megabytes. It's not a lot at all. Okay, Castle Grounds 1-7. Oh, we also need to put death warps here, now that I think about it. Castle Grounds 5-3-8. The warp out should be Castle Grounds 7 and... what did I say? 3-8? 3-5. Makes sense. Alright, let's see if all the warps work. We're gonna go in, we're gonna exit course, we're gonna jump into the hole, and then we're gonna go to the end and check if the warp out works. This should be nice. Okay. Did you make a video showing us how to combine a coin in the air and get Brandon onto Mundo so we can get Espen flying into the air? That's so funny to me. That sounds like the stuff a small child would do. Okay, that works. Oh no, I wanna be fast. You know, one way we could do this is whenever there is a line of sight between Mario and the Yoshi, or the camera and the Yoshi, that's when he speeds up. It works! We're behind the bomb. Now we just need to program the bomb. That's one side level done, dude! We finished the whole side level! That's so cool. No, they're down! Plus eight is done. This gets a plus. Next, we need to make the sleepy bomb. Yes, there is going to be a golf-like side level. That's also going to be extremely easy to do. I suspect most of these side levels will only take like a day to do. And the fact that this one was so fast proves my suspicion right. This is not just good in terms of, hey, we finished a level, this is also good in terms of, hey, looks like we're going to have the levels done pretty quickly. That's impromptu, maybe. But that's all unimportant for now. I'm not sure what that means. Oh, this wall? So it's supposed to be stealing the Yoshi Island core. If so, you can add the core in the game's title, maybe as D.O. in Yoshis. The core is a heart. Like the heart on the heartfruit tree. The super happy fruit. Putting ice on stuff is very rare. Have you played Whomp's Fortress? That is my counter-argument. This is like an adult version of the guys that go in and outside the fortress. That's the idea behind this. I know. No! It's this guy. What I'm making is supposed to be this guy here, but like a bigger version of it. Dude, what is going on? Why is it taking so long? What is it doing to this file? Is the ice done? No? Why are you guys so obsessed with the ice? The ice from Mario 64 don't work for what we're doing. Do I stream tomorrow? No. I like to stream starting at 2. And I don't know how long I'm going to stream. Maybe until 5 or 6. Or maybe way longer. Although I also want to do my workout, so it's going to be limited amount of time on my end. Dude, this is such a weird default blend file setup. I need to do something about that. This is going to be my startup file now. I always start streaming at the exact same time. You never noticed? Sometimes I want to stream, but then it's like, oh shit, I'm 15 minutes late. I guess I'll just skip stream. This is what it's all about. He stops you from going to the gym. And then you have to wait for the next part until you have made enough progress. That looks awesome. I don't give a fuck about the lights. That's the whole idea. We should make each eye movable individually, so he can have an evil expression. I don't give a fuck about the lights. I don't give a fuck about the lights. I don't give a fuck about the lights. I don't give a fuck about the lights. I don't give a fuck about the lights. I don't give a fuck about the lights. You kick him in the face, he wakes up, and he goes evil. This is what he's going to look like when he's sleepy. He's very upset. He's like, why did you wake me up? How do you make sure the player will be on the other bump after the punch kick? Bullshit. I don't give a fuck about the lights. Let's try to make him blink. That kind of works, honestly. Does it look somewhat natural? He blinks a bit much. He's a rock wall. Rock walls don't blink very much. I like it. What an evil one gonna do. He sends you to the mines, where the ghost Yoshi has to lead the way out. K-Dong is a new name. Now how do I make sure it doesn't repeat? Last time Leela was yapping something about an animation editor. And I know it's not here. Hmm. Just turn this off and that works. Can I actually do the bump-ass joke or not? Honestly, I don't know how that would work. That's my main issue with it. Look at him, he's angry. Make him sad when you hurt him? Well, you come out on the other side. So maybe as soon as you come out the other side, he just goes into the wall. Like you just see a cutscene of him going into the wall from here. From this side. That's it, that's the end. Also, I just realized I never finished the UV mapping here. Let me just do that real quick. There we kind of go. That should work as the UV map. LGTM. Well, do we like 3D model ass cheeks on the back side? Is that what you're saying? I want to play a thing to kick him in the ass. The question you're asking, I see. Well, the thing is, what if the player comes out of here and then instead of kicking the bomb in the ass, they just continue. I'm absolutely on board with giving him buttcheeks. The thing is, I'm worried about the gameplay implication, because what if the player gets out of here and then they just leave? Do I have to redo the level every time they want to go here? What if they don't figure out to kick him in the ass? That's what I'm thinking the first time you're here, the bomb just moves to the side. That's because there's a worry that the player will just keep moving. Of course Bowser hired him, he's one of his most important employees. Yes, that's what I would do. Nothing prevents the player from just moving forward though. What if they just don't kick his ass? They'll go here and then they're out. They think they have to redo all the mineshafts again just to enter this area. And they might just out of habit start redoing the area over and over. I'm worried players are going to beat the mines like five times. We could do what the new Pokemon games do and just turn the player around and have a text box appear. Like, oh no, don't go that way. No no no, you can't go that way. No no no, you can't go that way. How about this? We model his ass and if the player walks away, he sees a cutscene of him going in. If the player kicks the butt, he also sees the cutscene. The player has a choice, kick his butt or just leave him alone, but he goes in either way. How about that? So, Deep Iron 1 is in part 5. How far do I... A lot of ones, but before they try it again... No, that's disgusting. We're not doing that. I need to decide if it's worth it to turn into Tremor from the ones that do, or is it only by the console specs? I'll just do what I feel like. There's no system to it. So, Mario far, or he kicks the butt. Cutscene, opening... Disappear. And then... Yes, a switch case and a switch case. Let's talk to Mario as it goes. Going to kick Mario far away. Far enough for a kick. And... Cutscene of Mario falling into the mines. There's another eye on the side, and if you try and talk to him when he's receded and while he says no more talk to you, I'm giving you the side eye if you couldn't tell. Funny, but no. Okay, back to 3D model. I kind of don't want to look at this. Oh god, oh god, I can't show this on stream. I guess I just have to model a butt without anything to look at. Can one S&R come- Yes. You are correct. But we're just only going to hint at it. We're only going to hint at a butt. We're not actually putting a full-on butt here. It's just kind of going to look like one. I want players to see this and be like, is that a butt? Isn't that crazy? The text saying it's anus, but this is- No! RPG-13! I think this is about as far as we can go. Hello, Arodeos Ariocusite, what the fuck is that name? Do I have jiggle physics? No. Is one of us in a butt? For now it looks like it, yes. But don't worry. We're going to smoothen this out in a way where it will no longer look like it that much. Okay. See, you can't even see it anymore. The butt is completely gone. Of course he's going to get a hug. He's going to get a hug every time you kick him, for sure. I don't know if that doesn't look too weird. Did you make a mistake? I'm doing the majority of- Well, I don't- I mean, yes, I am doing the majority of it. Nowadays, Biobank helps a lot with reworking all the levels, and Bandube does all the music. Saryn did the retro section OST and now he's doing some music fixes. So it's no longer just me doing everything. It used to be, but it no longer is. I think I've given him enough of an ass. What is the music on Resonance Sequence music? Zero volt. Empty animation table. No. Fucking no. There's an animation right here. Are you kidding me? What?! It's an amazing bass, but it needs a little bit of the Bandube shine. Uh, no. There's no way you can do that. It's impossible, I'm pretty sure. There we go. Fixed the issue. Oh, impossible. I mean, if you want to compose in the M64 format directly, I guess you can do that. Pretty sure that's what's required. I'm pretty sure the only people that know how to edit the credits sequence OST at this point is Saryn and Groth himself. Hello, Voicel. That's the thing programmers like to say. But it has to be an insane thing to work with. You know what I never tested? Whether the level we made even works properly on N64. It could be that what I did is so expensive that it's basically impossible to play the level. Let's see. Why is it only 8 milliseconds? What? We're iterating thousands of vertices every frame. It's 9 milliseconds. It's so hard to play with all this input lag. And that's a bug for sure. Oops. I thought it was an M64. It is an M64. But the M64, like, do you know what an M64 looks like under the hood? You have to program inside the M64 for that credit sequence. Like, imagine I sent you a Blender file and I told you, oh yeah, don't move these 5 polygons, that's actually a program that spawns the flames. If you move those 5 polygons, the game's gonna crash. That's kinda what it's like. Actually, I wouldn't even send you the polygons. I would send you, like, the display list. Imagine I sent you, like, this snippet in your DMs. I was like, here's the model. That's kind of what it's like. M990. Why would this one be different? The M64 itself has code inside of it. There isn't just notes in it. There's code to, like, fade all the layers and stuff. Redefinition of upper bump. Oh, I'm stupid. Well, that's the fucked up part. I mean, yes, there surely is, like, a range of offsets, but that's not even enough, because you don't really have pointers on an M64. I mean, my latest video explains this a little bit. He would polish the music of his media in the universe and convert it to M64. I mean, maybe something similar to that is possible, but it's not easy to just convert to M64. There's a lot more to it, basically. Are you testing M64 without compiling it? I compile it. That's the wrong thing. Gonna have to play this on the RG Skelos model? Yeah, I'm sure that will work. Good luck. How is this happening, even though I cleared the parents? Bizarre. It's just as good as the Drink Prime. This stupid-ass feature doesn't work. And, of course, this is wrong again. I need to look into that. I can't live my life doing this over and over. I'm making just now the father bump. I used to do that, too. I was the GOAT of max editing. No one was doing the real Mario 64 king back in the day. It was just me, Todd and my lonesome. People were just using the ports. No one was making animations. How sad is that? I was the only one making animated characters until 2022, until literally 8 years after. It sounds like a sentence a cricket would grab in your hand. Honestly, I've seen a conversation of someone talking to someone with Wernicke aphasia, and they probably do sound like I just saw that. The fucking hex numbers. Anyway, how did you do mermaid animations? The mermaids aren't even the only animated thing in Lost Impact, but no, it was. I wrote a converter for custom animations from Maya, and then you had to hex edit geo layouts together, and the first few animations I made were actually made on the hex editor, so I had to 3d animate in the hex editor. Basically I had to like write out all the rotation values. And that was not viable. Um. For a bit she animates. And my function name is subtly debuggable, I need to work on that. I learned nothing. Okay, so let's make an EP at first. He's going to be set to animation frame 25, right? Yep. Let's see if he's in there, it looks fine. I'm thinking of making a big series about all the optimizations, just be safe already, and then maybe after it's done if people like it, videos about the game design ideas. Um. Okay, we're not going to be able to kick him in the butt like this, unfortunately. Also, what is going on with this rotation? Oh, I see. It's because we did not call this function. This is still too big, okay. Keep in mind, these swarps are not going to be in the final game. These swarps only currently exist so that we can move around the overworld. In the end, the entire overworld is going to be continuous, without any loading screens. Okay, there we go. That's the correct animation frame and everything. And now we just need to program kicking him in the face. Um, you should probably say something to Mario, right? Did I apply the B-frame to the wrong one? Well, of course there will be loading, but you won't get the warp transition, so it's all going to be one smooth overworld. Ideally, you wouldn't notice that there's loading at all, but I fear that it's not possible. I fear we will have to drop a few frames, no matter what. Did I apply the B-frame to the wrong one? Okay, there we go. Did I apply the B-frame to the wrong one? Did I apply the B-frame to the wrong one? Did I apply the B-frame to the wrong one? Boom system? I don't know what that means. Gotta fall far? I never played that, so I also don't know what that means. Okay, now we just need to bop Mario as soon as you're far enough. How does this work? We don't really need that, right? Mario should automatically just be down here, touching the hitbox. But for that, we need to play a cutscene, I suppose. Disable delta time when the framerate will need to sunset, or else the game will just briefly slow down. Don't use delta time. He definitely should not be rotating in mid-Mario. And he needs to get angry. Unfortunately, we can't just set a loop on him, so we have to go this way. Can I resurrect him? Yes, you can just one-shot it. Okay, so when you die, you still get teleported behind them. That's obviously an issue. I see why. Okay, I see what's going on. Okay, that's awesome. That looks awesome. Just gonna change the cutscene a little bit. We also don't have frameskip. The problem with loading while the game is running is that you can't just load while the game is running. Okay, so I kinda like this, but also, we need to make sure the player actually falls into the hole here. And we need to put something over the hole that he can jump on. Alright, so next step is make the sunbomb, and then make it so the player actually falls into that. Fix the warping out issue. That's something I need to do for sure. Where's my bugs list for this? Some code support for that, something like an extra warp ID that can be used. I think that's all I will do for today. We just gotta do the bomb sun, we gotta make sure the player falls into the hole, which we can do by just cheating the player's position. So that Mario cannot leave the hitbox anymore afterwards. Then we need to make the sun move down as soon as Mario lands. Shouldn't be an issue. Just need to give him the initiate time stop flag. Make a cutscene for that. And just move Mario down with him. Should be easy. So, until next stream, bye bye!
