Hello, hello? Anyone here? Can anyone hear me? Hello Epic Eraser, hello SumGuy, hello ExcellentGamer, hello Raypex. That's a very unfortunate username. What shall we listen to today? Late, I'm sorry, I was late by a minute because I was stuck on the toilet. Hello Nintendo for life. Something Legend of Zelda, I'm fine with that. But which one? I haven't listened to Oracle of Seasons in a long time. This is the wrong audio output. Yeah I'm in a new location, you guys couldn't even tell. I finally removed and now I am in a dungeon. Wait, is this only on my left ear? No, it's on the bottom. Hello SuddenPilly. I don't have the idea. I definitely had the idea actually. Dude, actually I do have a Mario game with a shotgun actually. Now that I think about it, I literally have the exact thing. Okay, this is that game. Lila, refresh the stream. Does she not know? I am still on Canada, yes. Yes, I've always had coin shadows like that. They do look pretty neat, don't they? Dude, since the last stream I made so many updates to this game. Oh, you guys have no idea. We found like a 10-15% performance improvement. At this stage, that is crazy. I don't think we will ever see another performance improvement this big. Until we implement F3DX3. Hello, Biobak. You missed the improvement reveal? I didn't do a reveal. I can do one real quick. So, do you remember how Bunny Brushworks was like 42 FPS or something? In the beginning area? Okay, I hope this is not duplicated. Alright, let me show you guys this. Oh yeah, look, there's a new star model here too. Lila can stop crying. There you go, this area with the debugger on is now 45 FPS. We got CMD down to 22.0. It was 23.6. That's like a crazy amount. This is done by making the coins. Instead of having them be billboards, they are now rectangles in screen space. So even though they don't look like 3D objects, they're actually sprites. Every coin here is a sprite. It's not even a billboard, it's a sprite. And without the debugger, 47 FPS. So there were some pretty crazy changes. Most of this level is 60 FPS now. Like genuinely, it's just almost consistent 60 FPS if you don't look at the whole level. Let me check this area. Yeah. I suspect this whole area is just gonna be 60. Wait, it doesn't? No, only coins use the texture system. Not even the particles do because of the textures. I don't wanna set that up yet. Oh, yeah, I see what you mean. They instantly stop spinning. Do you think it's better if they finish their spinning? I feel like that would make this less responsive. You know what I mean? It's kinda nice how responsive this is. They should finish it extra quick. Hmm. Hmm. The bird star select, we can look at it. I still didn't fix the issue with it. I was planning on doing that later. That is the first level, yes. I think this is the bird level. No, the bird looks great. You're wrong if you think this is ugly. This is awesome. He still does need to take off properly though. Dude, even this level is 60. Oh my god. I didn't even realize this level runs so well now. This whole level is generally mostly just 60 FPS now. Why is the boat blue? I think I gave them some print color stuff that I can adjust. And I didn't set the color to the right value. It already ran well, yeah. At least mid next year. No, I have a full time job. I can't spend that much time working on this right now. Unfortunately. Okay, so our next mission here is to make the power plant. I can also show you guys the black boss real quick if you want. Let me show you the black boss. Did you find it? Nope. I did not figure out anything for this whole running on thing. It's just gonna be what it is, honestly. That's what it currently looks like. Hmm. I'm not gonna guarantee any release dates. That's the thing. I have a full time job, I can't dedicate that much time to just working on this. You're just gonna have to wait until it's done. So the effect for hitting him, I made this yesterday. I think that's a relatively neat effect. So yeah, when you run out of soap, you're just gonna have to do that. Which I think, considering the fact that he goes to a different side, that's a good enough cure. I added a few coins to make this not too difficult. I suspect that the strategy will be to actually just run out on purpose here. If you do this in a speedrun, that is. You can see that he's not jumping quick enough. I'm going straight away into another platform. Oh, that's a good argument, yes. I did not think about that. Why are the platforms moving in and out randomly? It's a bit weird. Just for the extra challenge, I guess. Counter-tilting is gonna be almost the same as on R64. The animation is gonna be a bit more glitchy, but that's about it, I think. Why not make the platforms that the block goes through go down instead? Because you're already dodging on that line. That doesn't add anything interesting to the game. Why is he all rainbow-colored? Because that's what oil does. Still seems rather difficult. I mean, this is Course 11. It can be somewhat difficult. I agree with Biobak's idea to make the soap go to the outside cages instead, though. I think that's a good change. Or the outside grills. I think I will make it so that it goes to the outside grills. Let me add that to my notepad block here.  How difficult are you looking for it? About vanilla Mario 64. Although, keep in mind, the controls in this work a lot better. So a lot of stuff can be looking more difficult, while actually being easier. They're shamed into working again? They're not shamed into working. They are very enthusiastic about not slacking off. They're gonna brag about case? Huh? Oh yeah, I wanted to look at this room. Goddammit. Can I start looking at my room, please? Not what I wanted to do. Wow! Think about the message you're sending here. I'm not trying to send a message at all, I just want to make the funny Mario. What are you thinking they should be doing afterwards, Biobak? Should we release them by waking the other Mario? They were stronger and I moved them from Union. Ah, okay. I like the Union idea. Oh, it's not exporting correctly. What the hell? You know what? I like the Union idea. Should talk about their new Union and... What else did I talk about? What the fuck? What does this mean? Hmm. Nice error message. What is it? What is it? There was no message at all, Leela. It was just a blank error.  Guys, this releases when it gets done. Like, literally just leave me alone. It's done when it's done. That's all you're gonna get. It might have been the texture sizes that were the issue. They are so bad because they managed to get a 5-minute break every day and Bowser pays them 2 coins a week instead of 1. And about their cool new benefits. Like a 5-minute lunch break. Hmm. What are some stupid benefits that you would get from a job that don't actually mean anything? We gotta put together the stupidest benefits imaginable. I think the coin thing. I don't know if that works. That's a bit... It's a bit meaningless, I guess. I don't know. Something about it doesn't work with me. And the pros are looking for us. We just moved into our house. I am in a house now. It's not mine yet. We are entirely enslaved to the bank. But we do live in a house now. Oh. No, literally just keep looking. Eventually something will pop up, I guess. Just hope for the best. Just be patient. Instant poor when buying a house. I mean, I've been living like a very poor person my whole life, so it makes no difference. I have literally not been spending a single cent on stuff that is not worth more money in the future. In the past. I don't know. The only time I ever remember buying something for fun was a stupid toy I bought when I was 5. And then I played with it and I realized this toy isn't even that fun. And then I just returned it to the store. I've always lived like a poor person. What do you think of this style for the power plant? Do you think this works? What about the Yoshis? They are all gifts. I didn't buy a single one of those. Hmm. So I do have a few images of power plants that I want to use as an inspiration. I think this one especially looks very nice. I like the pipe structures here. I like how fucked up this looks. Bomb cap course 2. That's what I'm a bit scared of because I don't think the bomb cap course looks very good. Is that like a factory in modern galaxy? I have not played Mario, Wanda. I'm gonna wait like 5 years and then play it with my children. I like the colors. Yeah, but it's not like... It's too grainy. Game count control. I think the bomb cap factory looks pretty bad. Is there no decent Mario Galaxy factory level? Cookie factory? What the fuck? Oh, okay. 16 year old video. I'm going to rework it. Nata wants to rework it. He's gonna have it finished by the start of June. What the hell? Who's Goomzilla? Battlerock Galaxy? Interesting. I don't know if it's gonna be my last tank. I can't look into the future Yes, please stay on topic of making the heck Yes, you see the colors of our galaxy are very monotonous I'm gonna say they're very simple and What I'm doing is so grainy That's why I don't like this. I don't like the super grainy style. I Don't want like them. I Scrainy too. I Didn't know the final puzzle of our galaxy looked like what we want Yeah, it's too What's the words I Don't know if I would say too detailed it's just too noisy I guess I Hearted your comment. I don't remember what you said Okay, so I don't know if I'm gonna retire after this or not, please stop I just wanna make this I'm sure I farted some of your comments Lena I'm on course 11 How did I read your comment wrong because I absolutely read that you were talking about Mario Wonda I Mean I think the main issue here is picking the textures I This is the first time with our cleaner I've never met you before I see how it is The camera position new location I Moved I can't show you guys a quick room tour here. Let me give you a quick room tour So there's my CRT here. We got My setup my my second monitor I got two more monitors over there for work and then Behind me in this direction is a squat rack a bench The Yoshi cabinet and that's it This is my basement Zeina has banished me here. She said I'm not allowed to come up unless it's to grab food If The director is to me get the levels I'm going just give me a wipe. Oh, I already designed this level I know exactly what this level is supposed to look like I have all five sections here planned out and I have two rooms sketched The vibe I want I think this one gets the vibe pretty well Let me send you the three pictures I have for a vibe If you have that then I can start programming the platforms I guess And I'll leave the tech just to you You can't sleep with your colors you were never allowed to sleep with the Yoshi pillow There is still smell in this room I Will leave the textures to buy a bike but I will pick something for now that doesn't look completely awful at least I Think theme bar is good actually Like this texture is sick I Like this one Dude ever since we moved my neck hurts a lot Actually, it wasn't hurting and then I worked out today and now it's hurting again I'm becoming old I Really out here in my chat typing Google Gaga I Won't be an expert Did my shorts  What the hell I Thank you as part of that music all music in this game is custom so we're not reusing some other games music You All right, we got these two working There's a turret blur tool that I didn't know off Damn This isn't even good, ah Shit This Isn't even good I don't like this it's because the brightness is so different between the two sides Okay, what if we just do this You It's still has such a big brightness difference But I think this style of texture already works better it just has to be decent And we can maybe use like a little bit of this I Think that's good dude. This music is driving me insane. I'm not listening to this Plug wasn't that much of a pain to program. I Think I do like this floor here and I'm not sure about this floor This one here definitely needs to be darker though You know what instead of doing this I should just add the render output not I think the star works considerably better Okay, most of the block streams were not actually the block though we were actually just kind of working on everything else Super Mario 65 the rainbow stars my favorite whatever. Yes, that will be the last this is it Why do so many people today ask me if this is my last month I Don't think the render output was cozy snort maybe it was I Might course us not visible to the stream shit. It's not how do I make it visible? Huh? How's my course are not visible What the hell Wait twitch I mean, yes, Chris not showing Show pointer This was on before and now the course is back, why did it disappear? I Have never turned my course off Lila I'm not even gonna finish reading that sentence cuz already starting with some dumb shit. I Am so sick of fearing skippity toilet You cannot convince me. This is ironic All we need was to crash a little true Okay, so our platforms are treadmills We got dangling platforms we got collapsing grates And When that's it treadmills dangling levels collapsing grates Okay If I could make two triangles into one cube, that would be awesome I don't think it's possible though There's a lot more triangles than we need so we can do vertex colors if that's what you're asking Okay, let's start with the objects You know what I want to model them right in this level model here actually So the first platform you're gonna encounter is a dangling platform See what an appropriate size for that would be And how should it dangle? I feel like it should like move left and right a little bit or like forward and backward How do we attach the The ropes actually I didn't think about that Because there's gonna be ropes at the top of the platform attaching to the ceiling or chains rather Music's a bit loud. I can turn it down But another way to completely ignore back places like you could zoom and stick through them Yeah, I see what you mean that would be neat Wait Wait, isn't there a way to do that somehow I feel like there is But I don't know where This is a sub area of the main level here Okay, so if we have ropes attached to the top the problem is if we want to move the platform We're gonna affect all the geolayouts at the same time. So we could do this with an animation Just like we did it with the vines and course six or We could have them be synced at the same time and just rotate it. That might be the best option. Honestly, I Think that's what we should do I Think this is too much 500 might be the appropriate size for this So we type one two Three Four platforms here. I think that works One person just left the stream unbelievable I Think are thick Did you guys see the toaster speedruns There was a post a few days ago about how difficult it is to make a toast and blender and Biobak posted a 30-second speedrun of doing that and I wanted to do one too and I posted a 24-second speedrun A new official favorite Yoshi art Yeah, that fits Yoshi I Question is how do I want to make this look? You want Mario Odyssey to Ten years ago people were asking for Mario Galaxy free and 15 years ago people were asking for Mario Sunshine 2 and 20 years ago. They were all asking for Super Mario 65 Nintendo's gonna release a new Mario game and you're gonna like it and it's not gonna be Odyssey 2 It's just gonna be another Mario game like Why does it need to be Odyssey 2? I Do you think the Odyssey formula is just better than Mario 64 or Sunshine a galaxy Do you think that Nintendo's new ideas are gonna fuck up the formula and make it just a much worse game I Okay, that is true Mario Odyssey's movement is probably on a casual level the best one out of the Mario series I Think I should do this with my ring to prevent the distortion here I don't know if I think that Mario Odyssey's movement is that special compared to the other Mario games or whatever. I thought Odyssey was just okay too because exploring the game just didn't feel rewarding for me. I don't like games that rely on having you find little treats. I want the game that rewards me with finding cool shit. I want to see cool concepts, not extrinsic motivation like, oh, number go up. You don't like games. That's true. I'm not the target audience. I don't like video games. I don't like video games. This looks terrible. Do you like any non-Nintendo games? Yes. Guys, I'm going to have an insane heart attack here. This is going to be the worst thing I've ever said. I think League of Legends is a fun video game. You didn't say that? Okay, but there is a huge issue with that game and that is that they keep updating it. If you have a competitive game and you push frequent updates, you're just ruining it. There's no point in playing your game. If you stopped updating it, maybe I would play it. Imagine playing a game and getting good at it and then just update your game and some percentage of the skill that you've gathered just becomes invalid. And over time, your skill is just a measurement of how much you play and it's fucked up. And that's why no one should actually play League of Legends. Well, but a lot of competitive games are not like that. For example, chess. Chess has been unchanged for like 200 years or something. Dude, mouse. Stop. Stop! Why is my mouse moving? Stagnatory games are so boring to me. Like yay, I learned the meta and now on to making me lose every game forever. That is boring. I agree. But the idea is that at some point you stop learning what the game is. You start learning how human to human combat works, how like different concepts like a neutral game, increasing the amount of options you have, learning what the Nash equilibrium is, stuff like that. That's the fun part. I have not played Mario Wonder. The gaps are still 40 coordinates. That's too much. I think a platform like this might work. Nailiest platform in the whole game. Naily? I'm not convinced by this platform, but I don't know what makes this nailier. Dude, my neck. It's 10 million nails. Oh, all those thoughts are nails. I see. I see. Man. Oh, that's good to know, Dumpy. Who knows, maybe one day I'll need a new composer. Oh, you made for Super Mario Clips. That's already pretty good. I haven't listened to that OST, but that means you got experience. Always a good thing. Maybe something like this could work if we made the texture. I mean, the texture has to be lower resolution, but the idea behind it works, I guess. Although it would have to be like this to actually look like Mario can stand on it. Let's try it. This needs to be done in GIMP. I feel like you're lying, Lila. Somehow I don't trust what you're saying there. I'm not very good at GIMP. Dude, GIMP fucking sucks. Let me do this in Photoshop. Hopefully I can make this work in Photoshop. That was 154 coordinates, so 102. Mate, that's like perfect already. The problem with Photoshop is that it always turns the background color into white. And it always looks really bad. Actually, it should probably be like a darker gray. It looks like we just made a color and removed it, but trust me, this has a point. Okay, that should work. The ends don't match, really. Oh, shit. I did fuck it up. Wait, doesn't that mean they didn't match on the original texture already? Wait, how do the ends not match? What the hell? Up, down, up, down, up, up, down, up. How? How did this happen? Oh, it was because the resolution was set wrong. I think this will work. Let's add a chain to this as well. Maybe dark on one side and light on the other, but it seems not done. Oh, okay. No, I made sure they matched by pulling the leftmost thing. So the color is not going to be an issue, like guaranteed. Oh, there's an issue with the dangling platforms. They need to be different heights, I just realized. How can we have them be different heights and also animate them using the vertices? Did I set out to do an impossible task? What if we have them rotate instead of move left and right? That could work. And we could even have a B perm to slightly change the scale. Dude, I really like to be good at chess, but holy shit, playing chess fucking sucks. There's my chess hot take. Why? Because it's just work. Just pull the chains for holes in the ceiling. They should be in holes for the ceiling. The problem is, if we're going to have it move, we need to do that somehow. Programmatically, this is going to be an issue. Programming-wise, how am I going to program this is what I'm thinking. Okay. We can't just set anchor points, you know.  Man, spitting bars. You think it's fun to play chess? That's crazy to me. I guess maybe my first match I thought it was fun too. I played chess for like a week or so. I hit 1,400 elo and then I realized I can't do this. I don't want to play this anymore. I hate playing this. And then I just quit forever. Oh. I didn't fix this texture. I literally played it on my YouTube channel. I made it too, yes. I didn't just play it, I made the whole thing. I'm sorry DanGonPlayTV, I made the hack. Okay. All right, let's see if this works. I'd have to go on your Monsters Manor let's play. I was like, you should play Shotgun Mario 64. I'm not spoiling you what it is, but you're in for a surprise. Shotgun Mario 64, what could that be? I have no idea. Okay. You made that? What can I do? I said I made it as a joke and I apologized to the guy that made the hack. In the conclusion, it's like, oh, yep, Kaze made this. I knew it. Okay. Sometimes my YouTube chat actually just fucking hurts me. Okay, yeah, this side texture is a hundred times nicer. 480x320, I don't know if that's possible. That sounds crazy to me. Okay, I like how this platform looks a lot. Minus the chains that are fucked up, but that's an easy fix. Something feels weird about the Zebra figure to me, but maybe I'm just crazy. I'm not sure what the blue stars look like in an actual level. Alright, fine. Wait, there's not a single blue star I can spawn here. I think it might work as well. The problem is, I don't think that just because it's the same amount of pixels to render, it's gonna be the same speed. Yeah, that is really good at art. Here it is. The star. I think this is a lot nicer than the transparent star in Vanilla Mar 64. There you go. Okay, Leela, you're literally a generative AI, you cannot have ideas, I'm sorry. Yeah, it does have a texture now, which is the big, big thing. Okay, we can maybe animate this. Or make this move by having some extra things here. Like we have them go into the ceiling. And then the platform moves like this, maybe. Although this does affect where it meets the ceiling, which is why the effect could easily break. That's my worry with this. We could mitigate this by having the top be closer together. Kinda like so. Instead of moving the platforms, what about the weight system? Standing on one moves the other one up. Hmm. I haven't really designed the level around that, but that does work. Like that wouldn't be hard. It might work, let me see. More of that here. Honestly, that would be a really cool platforming mechanic. I think we're going with that idea, yes. I like that. Thank you for watching! If you enjoyed this video, feel free to leave a like and subscribe for more content like this.  And I'll see you in the next video.  I think I should just vertex color it. I want having them cross midway like an X, and having a single chain going up the rest of the way to the ceiling. Yeah, that's what I was suggesting too at first. But I think Biobak's idea of simply repurposing this whole thing actually works better. Because that's a platform type that we don't have in this game yet. But we do have a lot of swinging platforms. Maybe this area should use fog. I think I want vertex lights on this. I was actually thinking of making it so that everything would be lit by lights around. I was gonna have electricity things going through, and the electricity would light up the environment. I think that could be looking very, very good. I got an introduction to this room, and then a little puzzle, box puzzle with the wave platforms in the next room, or later in this one. And yeah, this is definitely made for the introduction. So the way this works is, I mean, if this goes down, you can just jump back here, so there's no huge loss. So I think this works for the instruction. And then this will be the puzzle room. That was actually the plan with the swinging platforms at first, that it would be introduced here, and then be used in a more complex way here. Then there's a little slide here. Okay, I'll just explain the whole plan. So we got the first room. The first room is there to set the mood. We're in an abandoned power plant. Everything's kind of fucked up. There's a door here, but you can't go through, because it's blocked by something. So you go around, and then here's your first time interacting with the platform. It's gonna go down. You're gonna be like, oh yeah, this is a weight platform. If I move down one, the other one goes up. You fail the first time, you go down here. I'm guessing you can just long jump off. Ideally, this would not be down here at the beginning, but like here. Even if you do fall, it's no big deal. Next room, we have a treadmill introduced. Treadmills should be fairly obvious in what they do. But just to be safe, there's gonna be one here, and then one like here. So even if you fail the first treadmill, you will just land on the second one. And then there would be more weight platforms here, where you would use them to get to here. I'm guessing we have some kind of puzzle with that, with there being two weight platforms here that both hang too low, and you have to stand on one, and then jump over to the other. Then here's a slide. At the beginning of the slide, you will see an electric hazard that blocks your way. You have to time your entering the slide to get past it. And then right here on the long stretch of slide, there will be another hazard that you have to dodge. And then maybe there's another one here. There will be no hazard here in the last stretch, because the camera is not gonna allow for that. Next room, you will be introduced to the collapsing grates. The collapsing grates are gonna be here, here, here, and then one on the other side. So you're gonna have to platform fast across these to get into the last room. The last room is gonna have a huge star here, and now the player understands all three platforms, and we can use all three platforms to make a rather difficult challenge, or not difficult, hectic challenge, to have the player reach the star, and that's it. Sounds good? Okay. So this area can be somewhat high-poly, because this is all indoors. Dude, I hope you can do good visuals. Factories are definitely not my strength. The bomb factory looks really bad, I think. I just hope Mata finishes his rework soon, because he's been doing that for half a year. He sent me a version that he made around two weeks or two months into working on it, and it looked terrible. And then he said he will try harder. Nice, TJ. That's good. Not dying is definitely preferable to dying for most people. Mata wants to upgrade the visuals on the factory, yeah. So you should hold off on working on that for now. He said he would be done June 1st, though. So I wouldn't say he's reworking the factory. I would say he is saying he's reworking the factory. If you catch my drift. Wait, elevator. For a second I thought I overwrote a different line of code. Fuck, that is scary. Yeah, he is usually on the higher poly side, but it's all indoors and it's all separate rooms. So if he does make it higher poly, it wouldn't be a big deal, because we can just cull the other rooms. I think the factory can get away with like 30,000 to 40,000 polygons. And the model right now is like 3,000. So it's all fine. Not that I'm saying that I want 40,000 polygons, but you know, it's possible. Oh, I see. Honestly, I was going to send it to you afterwards anyway. Just to look over it and make sure everything works out. I don't know how much he's changed. I can ask him if you want. See, the thing is, I paid him to reorganize. He asked me for a commission because he needed some money. And he just didn't do many things. So I don't know if he's actually still working on it, because he is four months overtime on something that he said would take him two weeks. So my confidence in this is not very high. But I did know that going into this, so it's not a big deal. No, it's all good. It's not a big deal. Dude, we're going to have Yoshi Milkman's new sound soon, actually. Now that I think about it, if we have Yoshi Milkman's sound, we should keep the grate intact. Because the grate is going to have different sounds from the outside. This is actually going to sound like a grate. This is going to sound like metal. Yoshi Milkman made so many new sounds for Mario 64 that are going to be pretty good. It's going to make the game feel a little more immersive. Just for that extra immersion. I haven't played Mario 1 though. I just make game. I like the video game. Mine is bad on cringe. Okay, but you can do that with mine too. So chat up later. Okay. The fact we have a tick function instead of a behavior loop is so cool. I like this a lot. Yes, Carlos, I would. Okay, guys. This is a genuine question that I don't understand. If someone asks you, would you do X? What are you supposed to say? Because I'm not doing anything. I'm not doing the thing you're asking right now. Why would I do the thing? What's changed? You have to be like, would you do X? If this other condition was met. That makes more sense. Just would you do X? Hello, Don. I'm pretty good. Oh, dude. Yoshi is getting close to hatching. That's cool. Lila, what I do here is basically the exact same as a struct. There's almost no additional benefit. Thinking algorithm. How am I supposed to answer a question that doesn't make any sense? It's like, would you eat bread? No, I wouldn't. I'm not doing it right now. Why would I? Of course, there are certain conditions under which I would eat bread. But I wouldn't just do that. You know what I mean? Am I talking crazy here? Yes. Okay, well. Fair enough. Would you download a car? I absolutely would. Hehe. No, that was not you, Brandon. You know what else pisses me off? Not even talking about it. Short questions. Short questions fucking suck. Because to answer a short question, you need a defined goal first. It's like, should you eat an apple? What for? Yeah, if you want to eat healthy, sure. If that's the goal, sure, eat an apple. But just unconditionally, should you eat an apple? What if I only ate 100 apples today? Then no, I shouldn't. I'm losing it. The goal is world domination. Should you eat an apple if you want world domination? Well, it's making your diet healthier, I guess. Because to get world domination, you need to live long. To live long, probably you need to survive until eternal life is formed. And then you need to form a really successful company, like Amazon. And get infinite life. And then we have 2000 years of Jeff Bezos world domination. German does have shit or good questions. And it's just as silly. Alright, this platform works. Should I eat 100 apples? Not eating. Another one is weak piss baby mindset. Go big or don't even bother. Yeah, the platform works. Well, I need two of these actually though. Well, I don't want to be a weak piss baby. So I guess I'm eating 200 apples. If he adds a ton of gears, that's good. That's going to save Biobak some work, I guess. And me too. I don't like making a bunch of small decorations. I guess some people find it therapeutic, but I don't really. Oh yeah, I introduced a new concept into the RTBI codebase. You programmers will love this. Look, this is how we program variables now. Fuck you. This is way more transparent than what the actual memory layout is. There you go, I said it. This is legitimately just better though. Because now he can actually know when you have RAM collisions. Because he had to type in the memory number. I'm not doing it right now. That's all I can say. That's why it's a silly question. You can see that I'm not doing it right now. I need to eat more than 200 apples. What do you think the world record for the most apples eaten in a day is? I feel like there's a Guinness world record. Honestly, we should make a new Guinness world record. Fuck the current one. Instead of that, there will have to be more conditions for a world record to be accepted. And there will be a condition like, at least 100 people need to have competed for this. Because right now, there's a world record for spending the most time with 1000 beans in a bathtub. And then there's just a guy being in a bathtub full of beans for a week. You know what I mean? Beans in a bathtub world record. What? Beanie said the world record for having the longest time sitting in a bathtub full of baked beans was lost at over 100 hours. Fucking insane. I didn't know that was a real world record. I probably heard that somewhere. What did you encase? From money. How much money? The world record is bullshit. You have to pay to create a world record and pay to try and beat it. It's purely for others. They beat a lot of people who do better, but they don't. That's true. That makes sense. Waste an L statement on L statement because it was supposed to be this so now when this one goes down the other one needs to go up how do we make it so that the one that Mario's on always has to priority cancel each other out so if one goes up and the other one also goes up then the other one needs to go down the velocity of them always need to add up together to be zero so if one changes the velocity the other one needs to as well so this one needs to go down faster this might do it I feel like this is how it is usually programmed this would not this did I accidentally upgraded from a $6 mouse to a $10 mouse and the $10 mouse is actually kind of nice I think Zainab bought me the wrong mouse what the hell is there a huge Bowser head that's just invisible in the middle of the level it's not good yet it was only last day for that shot I'm doing it wrong mine last for longer mine always last for a few months oh I see I think we might actually want this without a nounce five years or so what kind of mouse are you buying and how much do you use it five years dude five years ago I was 23 that's an eternity five years ago dude that's like that was like the beginning of Donald Trump no actually the middle that's forever ago that's before COVID okay that's a hundred sixty dollar mouse when did this come out 2016 okay wait why is it so cheap here I mean this is not what we want what the hell they should oh I see they should always not approach this they should approach the other things position wait it runs on batteries you use a mouse for a whole because Kirby 64 is a very simple game I guess it can also mostly do without a z-buffer which I think helps a lot okay this is starting to look nice I don't like that wait a second this is not what it should approach it should approach why minus this because this is that's 500 then we did I miss a bracket or something what did I do wrong just now yeah I'm gonna make a little door I think it will hopefully that would just be the natural consequence of how it works mathematically speaking somewhere in here is a bad typo that makes us not work but I don't see where oh I missed the arrow I used to have a wireless mouse but it would only last like two weeks before running out of batteries I guess it was a crappy one so it kind of makes sense okay I think part one is done now they interact nicely together and then we just need to make it so that they go back into the zero position if you leave them untouched for too long I think I don't like this part here how do we make them go back to zero if you leave them untouched man I feel like this is not the way to program it I think we need to do something else we need one shared variable between the two any OST we just ran out of music Zelda and Jill let's do this I think instead of doing something like this we need like a weighted velocity that is shared between both something like this let's try that yeah it's supposed to be like a scale we have to be careful here because OVALY is used by some of the actual code and OVAL is not used anywhere else in code until we transfer it to X and Z velocity so this might work oh sorry we didn't pick any textures at all yet we're kind of just getting a general vibe well this is not at all what I wanted cool some of that completely fucked it up but if you have suggestions I will look at them oh wait that was definitely not supposed to be there there's the link I think YouTube just killed your comment with the link because I don't see a link I think YouTube automatically filters all the comments with links okay I think if we just took the values a little bit this could work that's neat and a bit of friction to this all right the ground one does do something now I like that yeah so this is almost good but I would like there to be a little more of a zero momentum like I would like there to be a little bit of a delay before it starts moving so that you can meaningfully manipulate these to gain a bit of height advantage like that but that's way too difficult to do right now so I think the solution is in making this value here smaller and maybe more friction maybe less friction actually let's try less friction now that I think about it can you send the ones that you mean to me somehow right now Biobak was gonna actually look at the textures and not me oh yeah this is what I wonder if I can somehow make this even better to use maybe we just kind of hack this a little bit and make it so that it takes a bit for the platforms to start accelerating towards the middle after Mario gets off them I didn't make ground but make them go faster see how it goes down instantly now when I ground pound it's not much but it's like a little bit maybe I can increase this number just a little more maybe everything you should be a little further down but yeah I think I'm gonna make it so that if this is set then yeah we're hacking it a little bit sometimes you do need to hack the physics just a little bit to make everything work it's a little bit that's definitely a lot more useful now you can even use it already to get over here and the ground part now feels like it makes a lot of big difference if you compare the two hello chris and they still even out and run it Of the short time, kinda. And then this whole section is ruined, because when you really want to, you can just do that. I'm sure there's a way to get up there without the spin too. Maybe not actually. Alright, let's add more of these. Dude, why does my mouse always move? Holy fuck, I'm gonna lose it. This is so annoying. Oh shit, I just realized we need something in this factory. Okay, huge pile of breakable blocks, there's a coin in it if you dig deep. We can't just have that bee here, honestly, we're all good. Everything's fine. Is my cursor still visible? Or did it disappear again during the course of the stream? Like it did last time. It disappeared? No! God damn it, OBS. I wonder if we can make the climb here a bit more interesting somehow. My opinion on Nicocado Avocado, I don't know anything about him other than that he's very fat and cries a lot in his videos. Hello MetaDude, yes I'm still streaming. I think these platforms might be a little small for normal players. I don't know if people can do this. This is a hard one to figure out, can people do this or not? It doesn't look very difficult, does it? I think it's gonna be fine, if not we can still make it easier somehow. Yes, they still connect to the ceiling. Okay, how do we do the huge pile of breakable blocks for the Yoshi coin? I wanna do them right now. I'm thinking maybe, considering this is the first time you see them, we should have two of them here and set up these parts. So that the next part doesn't feel quite as surprising. I guess that it's already over with a more complex jump I guess. 1, 1, 2, 5. I think this should be better then. Which I'm assuming every stream you do is 2 hours or 2 hours and 6 minutes. No, I just stream until I don't want to anymore. It just happens that that's usually like 2 and a half hours in. Because I get hungry or whatever. I think this works, I think that makes sense a lot better. Next we need the treadmill. I think the treadmill should just be an object that we put somewhere and not custom collision type. Threadmill. There is one like that in the first Bowser level, do you remember? Where there's a Yoshi walking somewhere and then there's like fire coming from the back. He's not treating those Yoshis well. Oh yeah, we need more dubious union benefits other than the 5 minute lunch break. The more we have the better. Okay, I like that. No more timeout cage or less timeout cage. What does something fucked up Bowser's minions have to do? Green Koopas are allowed to turn around at edges. Dude, that definitely needs to be on there. Green Koopas are now allowed to turn around at edges. Fortnite conveyor belt. That's what this texture is called. I remember who made this texture. He called all his textures Fortnite something something. How about another benefit? Swamps are allowed to rest while no one's around. Swamps are allowed to rest while no plumbers are inside. Maybe that's too much of a benefit. Yes, it's still cross 11. Hmm. I kind of like this texture. Honestly, it's very like both are. It doesn't really fit the design of the rest of this, but in this very Bowser. I don't think I'll use it, but I'll have it here for now. I'm gonna go must have spikes that avoid getting crushed. What for? Am I missing something? The idea right now. Basically, after the strike, the Bowser minions have a union and they get benefits from Bowser. And we're making up like the smallest possible benefits that Bowser would give them just to be funny. Are any Yoshi's on the most comments? No, most are just the black salmon forces them to work for him. The Yoshi's do not get benefits. Forward. Who's that? Oh, the fat frog, I see. When you say toad in the context of Mario, I'm thinking of, you know, the character toad, not frog. Warehouse theme level. The boss fight kind of happens in a warehouse. But a whole level. No, I don't think so. The next level is going to be Wild West, and I'm really looking forward to that. I think the Wild West level is going to be really cool. And then course 13, 14, 15. They are not set in stone yet. On Saturdays, they get to sleep. Wow, that's getting dark. Maybe something like only 13 hours of work on Fridays or something on Saturdays, you know. They shouldn't be allowed to get to sleep. Only eight hour shifts on Sunday. Sunday is more brutal. Oh, that's unfortunate. Sailor. Families get killed. Something funny can definitely be done with a life insurance policy. That doesn't give us minions. This could kind of work. Yeah, I think this works for the sides. Just going to have to make the scroll. They don't have to do that. Okay, well, the problem is, that's a reference to something that happened after Mario 64. So that's not something I want to do. Unless we have the Baba music dance thing in this game itself. The reference only makes sense with knowledge that existed past Mario 64 is what I mean. I think every elevator should have a separate scrolling speed that we can supply. Then we can make some elevators go really fast and have the player abuse the inertia. I think that would be really cool. And you could probably do a jump like this and get really far. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.  Oh. Oh. Oh. I think this room may need like a platform here to stand on. Actually, just grids should work. And then this is all platforming and then the star is right here. I'm actually already going to put the star. This is star three, actually. There are no magic koopas in this level, so that doesn't work. But it also has to be benefits that are so minimal that it's funny. You know, stuff like if you get this benefit, that implies you didn't have it before, which is ridiculous. And I'll be honest. My neck pain today makes this kind of uncomfortable. And I think I'm going to end stream here. I want to rest my neck. It hurts looking at my screen like this the whole time, which means, unfortunately, I'm going to have to see you guys next Saturday. So I'll see you guys. Bye bye.
