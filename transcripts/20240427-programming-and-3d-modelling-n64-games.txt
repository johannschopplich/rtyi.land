Hello. Where is my people at? Hello, Clayman. Hello. Hello, Midwest Mystic. Hello, Sky. Waltz? Why Lilaa? Hello. Hello, Painless Schmuck. Hello, CXLinx. Hello, Pixfry. Hello, Stelton. So many people here today. Thank you for the sub. I forgot it was today. You're welcome. It's been some time. It's not. I stream every day. Every Saturday. So we currently have some issues in the game on Project 64 where some levels crash. Hopefully that will not be an issue today. You get speedrun ignored. Oh, hello, Pablo. Hello, LunaSquid. Yeah, today we want to start on course 13. What's causing the crash? Project 64 inaccuracies, unfortunately. Right now the game has a lot of issues on a lot of emulators. There isn't much I can do about it. Hopefully it just fixes itself magically like usual. What's the emulator you recommend? Project 64 1.6 You can use Parallel Launcher but I hate it. Everyone uses it but I hate it. Let's go over the design document here. The noise would run perfectly fine for the image check. Most people play it on Parallel anyway. Who cares about the PGA jumps? Yes, but Parallel is even worse. The compact I made for SimpleFlips on most Parallel plugins crashes because the emulator is dark shit inaccurate. People say it's accurate but it's not. It's just accurate enough to crash from the emulator inaccuracy as make use of. Would SM64 run faster if I recorded in Assembly instead of C? Yes. But it probably still wouldn't have come out because the Nintendo programmers are not good enough to program Mario 64 in Assembly. Let's listen to some Ice Castle songs. Hmm. I think this is a good vibe for this. Right. Related to us working on Course 13. We already know the theme of Course 14 which is a space arcade but we do not know what Course 15 is gonna be. Is Ice Castle an original theme in your opinion? What's the spin? Hmm. It's gonna be kind of a surreal castle. Right. It's not actually gonna be just like a castle made out of ice. There's gonna be stuff like suspended platforms. There's gonna be like things that will mess with your brain. Stuff like that. Hmm. I think it's gonna be cool. The Yoshi den? Yoshi in another case? Yoshi named case? Oh shit. That's already free. True actually. What's with the music? It's so creepy. This is the limestone key from the ice cap at Sonic Adventure. I wanna listen to... wait. Nintendo winter music. Let's listen to that for today's. There we go. We're not doing the space station because we already have the space casino. And we're not doing the theme of the castle because we have this castle here. You forgot it's the winter in Canada? No we're making an ice cap level. Or not an ice cap but an ice castle level. That's gonna be the idea for quest 13. But before we start 3D modeling anything at all I wanna make sure that we have a good idea for what quest 15 is supposed to be. I also started um started doing this. To like give us an overview of the levels. Of like the way the vibe should go and the difficulty. I think we're gonna reorder the levels a little bit to make sure the players learn all the important controls everywhere and that the difficulty has a good curve and that nothing is ever too monotonous. Hello pretty cool crocodile. Quest 15 needs to be a banger In my case you cannot miss. I agree. You should make it a snow globe with an ice castle in it and in the ice castle you could have a sliding ice block puzzle. I don't think I want puzzles in this. Puzzles is very much against the design of this game. Snow globe is a cool idea though. I imagine you're referencing something that happened in Monstrous Manor. I miss the part that it's a snow globe. I don't know what Lebrob is. What's your favorite byte in the original ZXL ROM? Someone asked me this before and I forgot what my answer is. Well one good offset in the original ROM is 86160 if you want to look at that. That's a good number. The ice castle is supposed to be difficult and kind of platformy I think. With like lots of suspended above abyss types of ice platforms and stuff like that. 0608 is a pretty good half word. The fucking 0608 meme. We're doing song quests and if you request a song with channel points we might listen to it. What's your dream level? The ideas we have for quest 15 would be a dream level where you enter someone's dream and it's like childhood things. Not really a fan. Music level? I hate music level. Something that changes between night and daytime? I feel like this has potential. A greenhouse full of plants could kind of work. The last one was kind of like a rainbow reef and the image is no longer available. But it looked very cool, I promise. Night and day level is too. Brodude never did anything like that, right? Oh wait. Brodude does it with the pipes, right. But there isn't really a difference between night and day. Some platforms just turn solid. I hope you don't think the detailed sick coding knowledge you have keep it up. Thank you, loops. Bird constantly puts Tuesday at level so it's the end of sex. I see. But to be honest, I don't really care. It doesn't really matter to me. I'm gonna ignore that fact entirely here. Greenhouse slash 3D and rainbow reef are gonna be bullshit to model. Yeah. This is so detailed and this is so detailed. I see what you mean. We should think about a theme where we can just make nice colors that pop rather than lots of detail that pops. Nagman did a night and day thing 15 years ago. Frauba did, actually 16 or 17 years ago. On what level sky islands switches between day and night? We have a few sky island levels already. Or well, we have one sky island level and one sky clouds. So I don't wanna reuse that. Hello, ZetaZeta. I'm pretty well. How's the work going? Well. Is this level for... It's a concept for course 15. The thing is, right now, three courses are missing. One of them already has an area finished and the theme is set in stone. This is a cool theme. It's a space arcade, basically. Course 13 is planned to be like a gloomy ice castle. Like an ice castle where there's a monster and you enter and it's all creepy. But course 15 we wanna settle on now to make sure that we have two themes that work well together in the game. We're making a palace level and you can do an open room sort of system and go nuts on details. That would be cool. That is if the level is one big interior. Yep, that is part of the parallel. Is 15 a Lilaa boss? I don't think so. Magical dream, mystical area, limited... No! Limited surreal dream, just color-wise just didn't do it well enough and the surreal parts is just eh. And then the hands didn't matter and then the time thing was just like disconnected. That's why I don't like that level. The obvious and super easy route is to just make fucking rainbow road. But we don't want that. With a rainbow beach level? We have a beach level already. I don't think so. Oh, is that a reference to Yoshi Milkman's first one? Is that a reference to Bob-omb Battlefield? We already have a flying ship level. And we have a ship level like in the ocean. Free-to-go palace! Hmm. Difficult. Maybe we can change and decide on something else. Although I really like the time type thing. I was thinking the day-night cycle here would be like 30 seconds. But that seems like a very anti-fun concept. Because there would be places where you'd have to wait for 30 seconds. Which is just lame. Candy-themed world? I do like that. But there's a plan for a side-course that's like an arctic ice-cream-based level. So there's a lot of overlap with that. And I don't know if I want to make a whole level that's candy-themed. But... The thing is, this is also the finale. This is the last level. We want this to be kinda special. We want it to be something that allows for difficulty as well. It should alter some convention that all the other 30 levels follow. I mean, it will be more difficult and surreal, I guess, in that way. Other than that, there aren't really many conventions in this game, I would say. Other than, well, actually, there's a side-level, a retro-pipe in every level. But breaking that convention, that feels like breaking a promise to the player. It's a fire-level, and at night it's a swamp-level. Labyrinth turns into a swamp. Yeah, that sounds like something that would work for a level like that. But at the same time, you just have to wait 30 seconds in places. Which is just anti-fun. Yeah, honestly. Yeah, I kinda like that. But then, which one would be course 14? Should course 15 be Bowser-related? I don't think so. Hello, Woofoo. Yeah, exactly. That's why I don't want that. Rollercoaster and Volcano? Well, we have the Koopa Wave Cove, which has a rollercoaster. And we have Koopa Carnival. Has to be Bowser-related or Yoshi-related? Yeah, I like making it related to Yoshis. Just reuse the THI mechanic. Yeah. It could be something like that. Yeah. I do like the idea of a two-stage level. A two-state level. Yeah, THI has already been done. You'd have to change it to something else. Not big and small. Brody didn't do that? Dude, wow. Great. Now we can do it. Because Brody didn't do it. Because that is what we base our decisions on. On what Brody already did. Yeah. A supermarket? That's not a very late-game level feeling to it. Let's just make this course 14, then. Yeah. What Biobak said makes sense to me. It's gonna be the Caterpillar for the Space Casino. It's gonna be dark with lots of glowing lights. Do you want it to be gimmicky or very platformy? Platformy. I'm pretty sure that is the way we should go here. Yeah. I mean, the last levels are all kind of platformy, I think. Lofty Lava Leap is mostly platformy. Honey Bunny Bay has some not-platformy parts. Ice Castle is mostly platforming. Space Casino is definitely mostly platforming. And then this is also mostly platforming. We should probably change the difficulty index. Something like... Something like this is what I'm thinking. Space Casino is mostly minigames. It is mostly minigames. But the minigames are all based on platforming. Do you want it to be very play-engagement-focused like Dino Land? No, not necessarily. I don't think that's what he was talking about. That's what he was talking about, Biobak. Divine Dino Domain, Litchi says. Indiana Jones vibe. At least I think that's what he referenced. Maybe a fruit-themed world. That's gonna be the overworld. The entire overworld is gonna be fruit-themed. Kind of like that Mario Party Board map. How does everyone here want to offer promotion? Okay, that's a ban. A Yoshi underworld? Actually? Oh, but we already have the underground cave and rainbow grotto. Maybe you can use the coins to play minigames? Coins? Coins are gonna be used in the overworld to buy overworld upgrades. That's the idea. Hello, NeoVim. I need my other controller for this. Let me just turn the audio down. Dude, Xbox controllers are so ass. You see how it keeps moving the camera down? That's the controller's fault. Let's go! Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm against it. I hate Xbox controllers. Make fog low to the lights so you can add it to the game area. It would make the lights a lot more visible. I don't understand. I've never played with an N64 controller. I usually play with a Gamecube controller but my usual emulator doesn't work right now. That's why I recorded with this emulator earlier today. Man, the lights really don't look good on this emulator. Might be a bug in my game though. Hey, mind the C buttons on the right stick here. Yoshi armory. No. We don't want to evoke vibes of war, you know, at least not the      Much. Why was the load time so huge? That's a bug right now, I don't know why. Some memory corruption going on. Does that mean it's a lot more accurate? Yes. Are we really that much against the rainbow reef idea? Maybe I'm just a big fan of underwater stuff and that's why it's the way it is. Yeah, none of this captures what I'm feeling with the level. How's that Yoshi related? That's a good point, it's not. Nope, I haven't. I have no motivation to use RS, I have my N64 right here. Of course it's going to be a final boss. Nice Fasana, good job. Keep jumping those chips. Speaking of chips, I have like 15 of these that Gamersub gave me. They were like test these to see if they're any good so we can sponsor you. It's called Gamer Soup. It's literally just repackaged instant noodles and you can just crunch them like chips. And eating instant noodles. These are like 500% markup for some reason. Yep, they just call it Gamer Soup. I would not eat that. You're not the first person that said that to me, that's funny. The other thing, you want to see my freaking pre-workout called Just Melon? They sent me pre-workout 2. It's literally just anime tits on it because it's for gamers, you know? You're gonna put porn on there because it's for gamers. Will you look like that if you eat it? Unfortunately Lila, that's not how it works. The Yoshi Walk Factory. Wait, a Yoshi Film Studio. Is this something that would work? What's a cool place or factory that people do in real life that you'd want to visit? Yeah, Yoshi Disney amazingly. I want to translate the gameplay. That'd just be like film sets and you do things around there I guess. Yoshi and the Chocolate Factory. What's a fun- I mean they would make like a fruit factory right? Steel Mill. I don't think Steel Mill would be a good idea. Steel Mill is something that little children dream of visiting. Luigi's Mansion did it. A chocolate factory. Would Yoshis not die if they ate chocolate? Wouldn't it be very similar to Cooper Cuddlewall? No, I'm imagining a very different fruit factory. That could be a huge tree in the fruit factory. Only one control player and it sounds pretty banging actually. Yeah, yeah. So is it a factory or a movie set? I'm not sure but you get the idea right? It's like a place that exists in real life that people would love to like visit and take a good look around but it's in the Mario universe. Are you talking about the film set thing where you go for different movies? Oh, yes it does, Spastron. Is it fruit based or is it jam factory? It could be a jam factory. So you're brainstorming what you want the next course to be. We are going to be working on quest 13 and we're brainstorming what quest 15 should be or 14 just so that we know we have two themes that work well together. Just like Willy Wonka, there can be some extreme levels of shy guy racism. Oh yeah, actually. But you have a lot of factory-like levels. I should just keep open office often. We have Mario's World. Well, maybe it's kind of like a real world location. A Koopa carnival, that's two. Oily Boily Bay is kind of factory-like. Yeah, I agree. Maybe all alone. Bubble Dome also has some factory vibes because it's like so built. Maybe a wood swamp level where the apes from Yoshi's Island could recur as enemies. That's a nice idea but not for quest 14. Quest 14 has to be like weirder, you know what I mean? Bubble Dome doesn't have factory vibes at all, but it's like built out of metal. Funny LST level. Sky Sanctuary. That's very similar to the Ice Castle, right? So the theme overlap is like too much. Are you still making a superhero level? No. That reminds me. I was thinking a level idea that would work is a level made out of draft materials. So like out of cardboard and paper. What else do people make this out? Maybe straws, you know what I mean? A level made out of this. I think this is nice and surreal. What do people usually make with that? Wasn't there a show about like some weird dudes with like a bowl cut making crafts out of paper? Oh yeah, like Yoshi's Crafted World. No, oh. How many natural landscape based courses do we have? One, one and a half, two and a half, three and a half, maybe four, five, six. Six and a half. Tell us about the most fun things. Light attack. Ah, yes. What shit did I make here? Okay, maybe that's not quite what I was imagining. Hello, Yannick. It's a shame if you ever got into it. I just know I was able to replace OSVI invent on bootmain with an OSV timer. So I can always run at 60 minutes regardless of region. Yeah, that sounds not very nice. It has to be bound to the frame rate or the moving. It's not gonna be fun. I think you're better off just scaling the movement and stuff. Wasn't played Yoshi's New Island. I haven't. Actually, I played one of the ones for DS. It was awful. It was god awful. The ones with the babies. There's like a ton of babies. Oh, the craft Yoshi levels because we didn't like a little hint about everything being plushies or whatever it was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Make sure you have a nice level. Yeah, it's 13. It's gonna be a nice level. Crazy quilt. Uh-huh. Hello, silo. Yeah, Lena, that's what I'm thinking too. We could use a lot of paper Mario textures too. So, yeah, let's note that down. Craft materials, paper, cardboard. What else? Plastic straws. What else do you have for craft materials? How are you doing? Good, good. Glue. Oh, yeah, glue, of course. Oh, there could be like a glue segments like glue segments where it's short and slow jumps. That would be fun. Origami. True. Pipe thinners. Yes. Cotton balls, ice creams, candle thingies, loop sticks. What is that? Loop stick. Oh, that's the ice cream thingy. Can make a level like the Truth Man show, but it's a Truman Mario show. I mean, that's what the whole game is, right? That's what Mario Bros 3 is. Duct tape, of course, duct tape. Yeah, I like this. Maybe boxes. Shazam where Mario gets covered in glue and he's all sweaty and hairy and he's trying to get out and Yoshi's licking his feet and armpits. No. Oh, I like googly eyes. There should be like googly eye enemies platforms like in Worms Fortress, but with googly eyes. Imagine, dude, a paper form with googly eyes on it. Just killing you. Oh, that would be so good. Hello, Sunshine Gamer. The goop from Mario Sunshine. This is all documented for your mods. Yep. And stuff we already did. Scissors. We could have some scissors lying around. Maybe like scissors lying around. Scissor enemies? Question mark. Rulers. Ruler enemies? Question mark. Ruler platforms? Question mark. Oh, the windmill things. Windmills. Those are also popular for crafts. Confetti blizzards. Oh, yeah. Confetti blizzards. Something like that. Definitely confetti somewhere. Macaroni noodles. That sounds nasty. What about ink? Like ink pens and inkpots. I think ink could work. Yeah, I'm going to note down ink. Question mark. Maybe there's a pool of pens lying around or something. Smoke machine. I don't see that one. But that's true. I'll write it down. Cardboard castle. Well, we already noted down cardboard and black boxes. I really need flexible launchers and launchers. Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking. Uh, wait. I'll show you what I was thinking for the ruler real quick. A paintbrush. There could be, um, oh, fuck. There could be pits of paint, maybe. I think that would work well. Or like just a tin box full of pins. Uh, not like tin boxes. Um, tin box full of pins. Question mark. What Fasana said? What did Fasana say? I don't see it. I see. Yeah, that makes sense. Goomba drinking glue. Crayons. We can have crayons around. The nice thing about this emulator is that fast forward is on the controller button. Isn't that nice? Oh, something weird going on here. There's definitely some memory corruption going on. This is what I was thinking for the ruler. Wouldn't that be like perfect ruler physics? All right. Crayons. The coin texture is bleeding. Wait, what? Maybe I thought about using Linux. Yeah, but that sounds like a pain. I already have my Ubuntu distribution here. That's all I need. Yep, I think I'm pretty happy with the craft materials level after this. And this will also be mostly platforming. I'm actually thinking this is mostly platforming with like a few characters made out of paper to talk to. Few characters made out of paper. Very simple dialogue. Should not feel like real people, but like machinery. Because I'm thinking this should be like very simple, like very straightforward. Very linear. I don't know how to act. Normally that's a memory corruption. What about a section where you're working on a monster's drawing and the enemies try robbing you out? Nah. Scrumler? Scrumler? Yeah, what is this? I like this. You know what? Wait. Um. Dude, I'm sure you guys know this one. For children, not for cats. Oh my god, do you know the thing where it's like a thing attached to a ball and just keeps spinning? I remember I kept seeing those on markets and stuff. Yeah, this one! Let him go! Oh yes, yes, yes, yes. We could have this as an enemy in the level. Wait, why does it say anything like that? Motorized weasel. Don't we have this in the level? That's just like a place where you have to go through. I think he's fun. It's an enemy? I don't know.    Is it arts and crafts related? I don't know. I think if we have scrambles, we can have this one as well. Good luck animating that. That's a good point. Either way, I'm happy with this plan for course 14. Let's start working on course 13. We should start by planning the levels and by planning the stars in the level and then we can make a little bit of a layout and work from there and do a little bit of an art test. Just to give you and myself a proper impression of what we want this to look like. Yes, I'm referencing my own hack. This room here, this is kind of the vibe I wanted to have. What's Course of Erion all about again? It's an ice castle. Can you just start figuring out by figuring out the boss? Yeah, I agree. Hello, Holly. Yeah, we're already on. Was 13 and even better than that already finished an ariane course 14 or 15 now can I moved it? We quotes wait, let me go know what a weeble is for quite That's what they're called I I have some of these I called them flunkies I've had them since I was a little kid. You know what? I always put them in my lamp There's some of my there's free flunkies over there. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait Look at this They've been with me for like 15 years always hanging out in my lamp, I've decided that flunkies like to sit in lamps I Have people student Yoshi do that's I like Yoshi do nuts or well do that in general I Was thinking about a bus you get to the top of the highest tower the moon is huge and we're gonna and slowly run around And that it is an eye That is very creepy Are you bolding no Zeina just fucked up my haircut She Forgot to be shit, you know what happened GTM She had the razor and she had it set to like I think 21 millimeters and she went over my head with it And then she took the top thing off to clean the racer and she just kept going She's just a huge bald line through here Do you know how bad it looked the day it happened I just had a fucking ball right here for half my head. I Do like the moon though, I'm like I've always been a big fan of the moon Glass ball toy fine. I'll look for glass ball toy Oh It's like a marble, I don't think we want those in our Wolf sentence She I don't understand Yeah, I don't think it's fitting Chris It's good   Because real, but we do want to be craft spaced after all Mother's for Shiggy. Why you guys saying for Shiggy? You know who does live in on the moon and Yoshi's Island because he's so Yoshi's Island related Not liminal you think not I Think he's pretty creepy if we set him up, right? He's like a dark void thing We could even have little guys around if he wanted to he's a goofy bird But imagine you are in the castle and you're in a big room with the boss and you're looking far and you don't see him and then you see his eyes slowly open and you see like two glowing white balls coming out of the snow and Slowly he walks towards you as you make out his silhouette Isn't that cool Ice enemies, yeah ice enemies are planned You know, it's like when he turns off the stars. So the sky is full black and he becomes invisible Yeah I'm not sure if I fully understand that I do like fighting him on the moon doll Second face when he grows arms No He plays feathers and he has no warmth and freezes kinda If it to make such a big enemy out of ice probably I think it's fine I We're thinking about the ice plug enemies from Like normal blocks but out of ice and the ice freezy guys By the way You Know not that Clark the nappy not on Yoshi's Island, but a nice version My PR on what I'm kinda on board with Raphel the Raven I feel like the people living here should just be the penguins from Yoshi's Island. Not that it matters, but They should be I don't think you can ever see them I like maybe maybe you see them. I don't know Are you have a dream level like the sponge from the FBI behind nope Not planning on that Nice claim on Thank you. I'm peaches with me My release trailer is my PR and what's the speedrun world record for a bit by the way Do you even see the villager that you want them to be locked up in our houses? No, you don't But maybe that's like a picture somewhere hung up in the castle or something. I don't know I'm thinking we can do maybe a little bit of a storytelling with like in the castle There's a room and there's a picture up of like the penguin King But like obviously they don't live in the castle anymore You know, just it's like This is our world background and we should keep it in mind as in these people live here, even if you don't see them Having a big snowman boss also kind of works we can know that big stone and enemies actually Like Imagine there's just a big snowman hat And there's a stone my body below and then the snowman head rolls at you And then it waits like 30 seconds or so and the snowman hat goes up I like the pokies doing and the body comes through and there's no minute rolls around and you see the face again I Think that's nice and you know, it's crazy. I Like the idea of the extra castle being the bottom and manifesting enemies to kill me I Know but wouldn't that just turn the boss fight into like a Rush thing doesn't feel very cinematic to me Did you put in a song request claimant Oh God Meaning if our father really I can but I'm not gonna we don't even know yet that it is gonna be Rafael the Raven The boss fight does kind of matter a lot here I think we should have Ravens here though, just because it does kind of sound I see You But whenever that was permanent Marines and one of us were moving in and they don't like each other no, not what we want So One gets a pretty cool idea, maybe it's at the bottom somewhere new and grows until it's your explodes Well, I'm just gonna make it pull off the hat because then the hat attacks you and then it's kind of funnier You hate fun. No, no. No, it's like we don't want this to be so character focused You want this to be just all vibes and platforming? You We're not gonna add bird poo to this Maybe the boss fight should just be the Embodiment of being ice the fucking ice ghost or something the the spirit of ice Devin Devin the Simlish again, you know what I mean? I don't see how that would work though And I do want the Yoshi's Island reference What are the Yoshi's Island boss fights Sky the big slime the big boo the pot and ghost the pot is ghost is cool It was like being on top of the ice tower with the moon and background would be very cinematic I agree that would be very very cinematic And I mean the Raven is perfect for that, right? Although I guess the Raven would want you on the moon. I Guess we can reference the moon existing in the Raven fight because it's like same vibe Even the bus throws you stars from the sky. Oh I Don't even jump off the moon and that's how the boss it's actually that's kind of a sick idea Like if you just get to the highest tower and you look around and the moon is like big in the background and you see a guy walking on there and then like a cutscene starts like the goma cutscene in The Deku tree and he just jumps in front of you I Would look fucking sick But then he's not in the castle. We want the bus to be in the castle Or do we do we need that? I Don't make any crazy in the art while he does that let's see what a scene in this level might look like I'm just gonna make a very basic concept. You know, what would be cool? You know, how snowflakes are hexagons What if we made the rooms in this entire castle hexagons Medieval quest as the last one would have been full of dragons and stuff I would also fit with the time mechanic for day and night, but I need to watch Yeah, we decided kind of against the time mechanic. We thought about it The problem is you would end up being in locations where you'd have to wait until the time changes So that's just not really fun. I think Crazy I'm not much artists in it and nightmare platform like secret or post final boss. I Don't want to make levels that are like so arbitrary. What is the concept for Course 13? It is an ice castle And Right now we are doing a little bit of an art style to us to To see how this level needs to look good Don't forget about Raphael. Yeah. Yeah Raphael was What I wanted here and we're definitely gonna have some Ravens in this level. That's Actually silent Ravens that's noted down It's just the question of whether that can be the boss because this level is very like focused around the boss So we need to make sure that it all works out. Well I Want cool breeze terrace, I don't understand Anyway, our next mission is to play with shaders until we have something that we like for the art style of this level But I've already discussed Ellen I don't know anything about it yet. Yeah I I Have so many ice textures now, this is gonna be so easy Let me think about this I'm thinking there should be stuff frozen behind ice walls. That would look really sick My favorite Yoshikawa is black So they're seen like this an ice age I Don't know if I can find that Yeah, kind of like this is what I'm thinking but obviously not with dinosaurs Let me just keep this open here so I can reference this later A Big skull to the nice It shouldn't be funny It's something just for rainbow grotto, yeah I can't write it. You know your own laughing point of the day?  Yeah I know. It's funny because you said skelton. I don't have any experience programming anything. Will you recommend on how I should start? How good are you with math? Because that's gonna decide a lot of things. If you're good with math you can just start programming in like C for Unreal Engine or something. If you're not then I'm not sure honestly what you can do if you're not good at math. You might have to learn like programming for tutorials and stuff. There's a lot of good tutorials out there for Unreal Engine on how to program things and you can pick it up from there. I do recommend using ChatGPT to learn about Unreal Engine or any other game engine you use. If it's a popular enough engine basically every problem you could possibly run into has been solved by someone else before you. So it's gonna make your life a lot easier. I've got a simpler go for that. How do you use ChatGPT to learn? You just ask it. What do you wanna know? Let's ask it. How do I make my 3D mesh rotate in GoDots? And it's just gonna tell you. Can you see? That's how you learn. Just read GoDot and I'm sure you can do that too if you want. I'm not gonna prescribe you hard to learn. I'm just saying this will make your life pretty easy. You'll also be able to sleep well at night knowing that by using ChatGPT you're taking a job away from a shitty Unreal Engine tutorial channel on YouTube. True. We gotta make sure tutorial channels on YouTube do good jobs. Sorry, how could I forget about that. Hello, Velze. Why do you think math is important in gamedev? How are you going to program something that feels good if the math you're using for how it controls does not feel intuitive to the player? Something like a cosine feels very intuitive to a player, I think. But if you can't do math, how are you gonna do that? I don't know. That's why. Is there going to be a future base post-apocalypse with maybe roars and stuff with robots? Am I a better simulator? Yeah? Although we have our course ideas already, so I don't think we want to make any changes to that right now. Modify Godot character controller? Awesome. Math must be a mess sometimes, but will I be able to remember them easier than others? I think so, yeah. Why are people complaining about Rust? Talking about it pretty poorly. And I think that is what's going on with Rust right now. Yeah, this looks like shit. Ship it. We could do a little bit of additive combining. Let's experiment with that. Don't worry, Zig will replace Rust as the new thing to talk about. And then everyone will hate that too. I have no idea what that is. Every year people reinvent C. It's crazy. I think C is safe too. C is like the most vanilla thing in the world. No one can hate on that one. Okay, guys, here is the fucking programming black pill. A language is already not safe if you program bugs. So just don't program bugs. I remember I was so against the idea of programming in C because I hated dealing with compilers. I was like, I'm not programming in C. Compilers are so fucking annoying. And what happened four years later? All I'm doing is fighting the fucking compiler. What if we multiply this by shade color alpha? Oh, that's a fucking sick effect, isn't it? Can we not put shade color alpha here? We can put combined color here and multiply it by text zero color. Combine color alpha zero X zero and shade color alpha here. No one minus shade color alpha. Shit, how do I do that? Zero minus one. It's just minus shade color alpha. God damn it. So look at the opening slides of my presentation on treating phobias from your psych class. Cognitive theory. What? Is there any math course? If you want to do game math, the most important math course is like linear algebra. But really what you want is like a good math intuition. That's going to help you more than any math course. I mean, I like how this looks, but like, it's not good yet. This would have a very surreal feeling if like this didn't fucking overflow. Wait, I can put shade color alpha here. Oh, there we go. And then I can just reduce primitive color alpha. Let's get rid of the fuck shades, just no up. Yeah. This should not look like this. I think we'll look different in game. So you came out of focus. It might be. It just looks like fuck. I think that's just a blender bug. We should look at this in game once. See how this turns out. Check the court. Let's see. I see. I see. I see. I see what you mean. Yes. That would be a fucking sick cut scene. Step on a bird. Yeah. This would be for Raphael the Raven. Yeah. Yeah. See boss. On top of the tower. And still can't see. It's just going to be this. I'm thinking Mario paint. That's that's what my notes says, but I don't know if this will be. I don't know if the rain would fit there, but it would look insane. Angry and be such a cool visual. I feel like, okay, I said this before, but boss fights and video games. They're like zero fun for me. I think I can only appreciate boss fights as a set piece.  So for me, the number one priority when we make a boss is to make sure it's a cool set piece. So this does that really well. Our pain would work much better in course 15. That's true. You know what? We should just swap this to the craft course. I agree. Let's do that. It wasn't really set in stone. Anyway, it was just the random notes that just happened to be there. Because 13 is tiny, huge, right? Yes. Well, I'm thinking the paper level should be like course 14 and not 15. Or do we want it to be 15? The thing is, 13 has like no characters at all. The paper level is probably going to have a little bit and 15 is like in space and weird. So I think it works better that way around. Hmm. Wait, what? Okay. Well, it's warning me that I might have made mistakes, but I did not. I want it this way. Should add the spin from Galaxy. Stress. Migrate. Am I in the fucking floor? I am. That doesn't crash instantly. That should crash instantly. The hell? How did that not crash? Oops. You look like Jonathan Blow. Dude, apparently I look like a lot of people. I do not look like Jonathan Blow. What the fuck? I learned recently that I look like Arthur Tilly. Or rather, Arthur Tilly looks like these people. That's a cheap knockoff of me. Generally, he does look like a cheap case knockoff. Okay. Maybe this works on a different emulator. Let me see. Lilaa, you look like me. Yeah, bro. Honestly, you're basically 1 to 1 me. What do you get for saying some dumb shit like that? Yeah, this did not work. Let's go with a more sane combiner. Yeah. Am I fucking blind? Where is fog? Lorraine, overlay.  Transparent decal. Transparent. Opaque decal. Opaque. No op. Transparent.  Transparent. Cutout. Opaque. Let's see. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. This texture is barely visible. I don't like it. It needs to be something else. She needs the Hall of Mirrors effect, and then she has a feature. I have a note for this. Right here. Frame buffer, not cleared area. That's the plan. I'm thinking we're just going to have something with like 50% opacity, so that there's like a trail behind all moving objects in this castle. Because this is kind of a surreal looking castle. You look like Freddy Fazbear. True. I just could never get rid of that Freddy Fazbear look. That's kind of cool looking. If you have everything based on hexagons, I think this kind of works. I want to change the fog here too. I think the fox should just be like blue. Why does it turn into white? Maybe it shouldn't be dark blue. Maybe it should be like a really light blue. Should it be white fox maybe? This feels too desaturating, doesn't it? It actually doesn't look like ice at all. Ice piece on the ice? Yeah, it does kind of look like ice. Why is there no fox? I don't know, Kazini, that would be niche to me. Seriously, you know, the fox is just not there. Do you not have a voronoi texture? What is a voronoi? I know what the issue is, I think. Let's try to copy these here. How is the fox still not working? Let me check a different emulator. This might be a project 64 issue. Nope, it's genuinely just not there. Interesting, that's definitely going to be good to look at, Kazini. You've said forgo-able? Well, let's try that again. Idiot. I can't believe Limone called me an idiot. Yeah, I kind of like the fog intensity here. That's about the vibe I wanted, I think. Looking good. Hello, Donna. What's up? What's up, somebody? So, I'm not doing my part for the day? No way, she's not a real bunny. Which custom are we on? 13. Yes, I am in a basement. I'm all alone right now actually, Zeina is not here. It's just us guys. Zeina been well? Yes, Zeina is friend, true. I haven't seen Zeina in months. Yeah, she is in her own office nowadays. So, there isn't much reason for her to be in my background anymore. Never stop playing Speakvine for more than 30 seconds. It happens. The main reason I try to talk a lot on stream is that I'm trying to be a good streamer. In real life I do not talk very much. It's weird that this is not perfectly even, I'm not sure why that is. This class needs a nice light shroom, thanks to mehive, I like it. It's brodiot? It's not brodiot. What? You're out of your mind. It's not brodiot. Let me just see what feeling this whole area gives me now. Yes, this is gonna be a very detailed guy that creates random stuff. This is just an art style test. A red coin labyrinth with instant warps. I'm not so convinced by that. Oh, right, because the fucking decals are in the first. Love it. Hello, Morch. Last thing you saw was an oil rig? Oh, yeah, that was a while ago. Things are going pretty well. Can a 3DX only use Fargon decals? Yes, but a 3DX still doesn't. Now, you're just suggesting patchwork fixes, guy that creates random stuff. The problem is the render order here. It's not difficult to fix, but not what we care about right now. We care about getting the feeling of this place right, and the feeling of this place is not right for me. I don't like this. This is not what I envisioned this to be like. Let's try Black Fog. Let's try Black Fog. I kind of need the damage output platform solid white. Yeah, I'm thinking that too. Just have like white specks on there. I think the black already looks a little nicer, but the walls of this don't look like what I want. Oh, Fargon is a genius, not a master. I don't understand, Lilo. What are you on about? Hmm. I mean, the render issue here is fixable. The things like the shine of the wall? Yes, yes, the shine of the wall is an issue, and we will look back. Starting with you, are you having any tips? Yes. Learn to rotate a cow in your mind. I'm just going to put these on the 7th ember rally, so we can look at this properly. It's like a frozen beehive, kind of. I really need an nth map decal over the walls, but I don't want to murder the RDP. Well, okay, what I was thinking actually, is that I want to make a map decal for this area, so we have ice walls like this. Let's make this some kind of brick real quick. Say, make the black pit the same as the white fog. Maybe it won't work, but... I'm not convinced. I want to try this first. Okay, let's try this. Oops. Okay, let's try this. Okay, I'm trying to make a crystal wall here. Yes, my wife still makes art for this. Yeah, the sword castle is getting too dark. I think nice blue fog is actually to play. Something like this. Oh, we got married a long time ago. I'm trying to make a wall look like a crystal. I'm trying to approach the other way around. Do you want me to make a crystal look like a wall? Wait. Okay. I think the problem is that it's too... Unnatural. Why is Bari walking so slow? What? My controller must be so cooked. We need more crystals, yeah. The top of the bridge just is transparent. You can see right through it. Okay, I'm googling Voronoi, whatever this is. Voronoi. Ah, interesting. Maybe there's a good inspiration here somewhere. Wait, do I not have concept art here? Content no longer available. Content no longer available. Content no longer available. Cool. I feel like I probably posted this in my own private Discord here. Let's see if I can find it. I did. This cutscene's expired now, so you're fucked. Well, that doesn't really do it either. We want the scale of the overall rooms to be bigger. Make it feel truly bigger. Oh my god, Gramps, is the whole place 5 minutes still out? Yeah, yeah, definitely. But we need to get the scale first. Move the edges here. But the colors and the textures are not right yet. I can tell. That's what we need to get right first. First, we do the colors, and then we can do the detail, you know? I mean, we can scale it up by two for now, just so it's a bigger room. Is there going to be a tower sorcery tour? Sure, let's look at this. Why are you making all these laughing emojis still? That instills very little confidence in me. Oh god, can you imagine? This is what other N64 games look like. I kind of like these crystals. Wait, that's kind of cool. Maybe I want that. Maybe I'll steal it. Let me get my water from upstairs real quick. Be right back. I need some water. Hmm, I'm stumped. But let's look at Ice Castle images on Google until we find something we like, and then we can kind of recreate. Very dark lighting here. High contrast. I like it. Yeah, the high contrast is kind of nice. This is like near black too. I can do whatever I want, guy that creates stuff. Hmm. Do my notes say anything about this? Eerie, but not dark. Maybe this level shouldn't have fog. Maybe fog is the wrong decision. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Let me try another concept. I just had another idea that might work. Hmm. Okay, we need a new song. If we're modding it, then it's not the N64 anymore. Like, what's the point of this? Fuck, but with hexagonal gradient and alpha, so the textures disappear as you move away. Hexagonal gradient and alpha. Hexagonal gradient. Gradients are like 1D shapes, not 2D shapes. I'm not sure what this means. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.  Parent Biobak, that sounds like a good idea. I really want to build one of these, somehow. One or something like this would work. Wait what? What happened? Let me just fix that real quick. It's not terrible I think. Well, the texture doesn't look good here, but the effect itself kinda works. What if we do this, but with enviromapped semi-transparent textures? I mean it obviously looks terrible right now, but I think the idea has potential. Exactly what I'm thinking Biobak, exactly what I'm thinking. What's an efficient way to model this? What does this look like in game? I don't know if pet respawns still exist in this game. Yeah, it's not really to my liking either right now. It doesn't matter that much, because if you look at this, those three layers, they're gonna cost maybe 9 milliseconds. I guess it's a lot, but still, in small room sizes it's fine. Yeah I know, it's on a straight triangle. Yeah definitely not happy with this, but we're still doing more work. So I'm gonna just define this here. We were thinking of spikes like these, right? I'm guessing that's what Biobak was thinking of. Let's look at more eye stuff, maybe I get more ideas. The one thing that bothers me about this is it doesn't get darker towards the edge. That's kind of something that's important to me. I think the way to make this castle look good is to have a lot of shadows going inward. So we need to make sure that there's like different levels of darkness to those triangles. And then I think this could work. Do we change the hexagons? I think I may want to switch off the hexagons, but first I need a picture that looks what I want my thing to look like. I mean this is kind of cool, but like the depth here is really difficult to do. Maybe we can find a shader that can do the depth here. That can kind of fake it. I think that would be our ideal solution. Something that kind of looks like it has those spikes, you know. Which architectural style has the most right angles for a castle? A bunch of cuboids? Well, I mean, I guess you can do something more than cuboids if you have more subdivisions in there. You can have infinitely many right angles if you want. I think I need to make the middle level have more juices to make it thinner the more it goes down. Yeah, that's true. But first we need the colors right. What is this for? My money. This is a Cruise 13. It's a castle made out of ice and it's very spooky. Yeah, I think maybe a spiky texture that we need is gonna be in one of the rock folders. I feel like a rock texture could work to make the ice castle here work. Minecraft snowy block, let me see. Minecraft snow block. No, definitely not. Is this Harvest Moon? It is! Add ice, go off ground. Did you just send me a virus? Yeah, one of these textures here. Oh yeah, that's what we're looking for I think. And then this one can be something like this maybe. Oh wait, this texture doesn't tile, god damn it. Texture is great for making things look like a craft material, that's true. Wait for us from carving, I'll need an image or something. Starting on a new level is always the most difficult thing because there's so many things you have to keep in mind to try and make it look good. Maybe that bottom left texture, I stopped seeing whatever texture you were talking about like two minutes ago. That's the Twitch delay or the YouTube delay in this case. And the human skin texture did a job making white and textured snowy piece. We have a specific image in mind, we don't just want it to look snowy. Like we already tried that, that didn't look, that didn't pop. It's not what we want. Hmm. I'm so sure there's the perfect texture I'm looking for. Basically I'm thinking of having a texture that has these little little down arrows here. These things that will make it look like there's a depth. A lot of these textures are just ripped from Nintendo games, so if you remember Nintendo games very well, then you probably know a lot of these textures. Or all of them. Okay, this one is seamless, but this is still essentially a seam. The tiling is too obvious. Hmm. What if you combine this to make something that doesn't tile too obviously. Surely we could edit this texture to somewhat work. We also probably want this a little bit of a shade color, minus the other one. A little bit by something else. What's the best way to do this? L alpha. Something like this maybe. No. I promise I don't even know what I want yet. We're figuring it out right now. So. So. I'm thinking maybe less of this. So. And this is a terrible texture. Let's replace this for something that actually looks decent here. Hmm. Is it still enough for any natural looking texture to have obvious tiling? Yeah, that often happens.  Let me check this out in game, just get a feel for it. Wait, I didn't change this yet. Okay, this is somewhat interesting to look at at least. Not really what I want though. So. It has some depth at least, which is good. I feel like it's not going to be possible to add as much depth as we need for it to look good though via this method. But I'm going to ice cavern then the castle build out of ice, that's just true. Need to fill the room. No, we're not doing anything before we don't know what looks good. Stop telling me to do random other things that have no benefit. We're trying to make this look good and then we do this. Look, I appreciate all feedback, but if you're just backseating without trying to make a useful suggestion, if you just be like, oh, do this the way I want, that's just annoying. Adding icicles helps? I think so too. Yeah, exactly, Lufbe, that's a problem here. Or that is one of the problems. I'm just thinking about how we can maximally capitalize on this texture here. I think this texture here works well if there's exactly one repeat of it. But if there's a second repeat, it no longer works. So I'm thinking this material. Should be used at the top here and then maybe the hexagons we had before could be everywhere else. Because this is a good texture combination, I think this is doing well. Hello, cat. We just need something else with it. And so this second texture isn't doing shit on this material. It's barely even visible. And I skip texture a second to look like bricks. Yeah, I can kind of see that. So you are thinking like icy bricks. Or is it just cocoa mud? Let me see this.  You mean this one here? That one kind of looks nicer. The black one. I am confused. So. I have an idea, though. So. Is there a haircut? My wife fucked up my haircut, so I don't know what looks like this. Same brick texture and ice brick texture. I don't think that's what it would look like. Either way, I have an idea. Just watch. So. I swashed in castle. Okay, let me look that up. This here, it's just a brick castle. I don't know, Tuffy. Not something I want to think about. I just want to make my game. Can we just make the game?            I don't want to talk about anything else. I left texture instead of mold. This is subtractive, actually. Yeah, that's my idea, Technoshift. Ice blocks with some spikes at the top. The question is, can I make good ice blocks somehow? There's something like this, but. How do you make ice blocks or like an ice block texture? Something like this, maybe. Looks pretty ice blocky to me. Is this no longer fog shaded? Oh, wait. That's why. I think what happened to the global fog? So. Let me take a look at this. Oh, wait. I messed this one up. Give me a second. This is what I want. So. There was supposed to be an environment decal on this. Somehow that didn't work out. Maybe I increased the opacity. So. It's not doing the decal in game. Oh, wait a second. Maybe. This is why. That should be the reason why. Hopefully it works now. Yeah, yeah, we might do that on the bridge too, with like a snow texture. There we go. I think that kinda makes it look more frozen. Yeah. Let's try this with a snow texture here. Like a snowy path. Spikes up top are a little too dark now. Yeah, we still have to do those. We haven't done anything regarding that yet, don't worry. I don't care about the floor triangle. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Why is this black? What the fuck? Yeah. Did I... Did I... send the relic scars to blood? I did. That's why. That's why. That is kind of nice. That is kind of nice. That is kind of nice. That is kind of nice. That is kind of nice. I don't know why all the other pillars are gone. But yeah, I feel like this is kinda starting to look okay. It's not quite there yet though. It's missing all the contrast that I'd like. And of course the spikes at the top don't work at all. What am I doing down here? We're trying to figure out the art style for Quest XIII. I don't think this is it. It looks nice so far. I'm not a fan of it. I think it looks passable. But compared to the other levels in the game, it just looks bad.  See ya, Zelda. Let me google what a mortar is. Let me google what a mortar is.  Let me google what a mortar is. Let me google what a mortar is. Let me google what a mortar is. Let me google what a mortar is. Yeah, I don't see that working I have no idea if this is advisable But let's try anyway What does this exact piece mean?! I must be a기에  Suppose it's a внешrang Emotional I'm not sure I understand what that does Oh, do you want the glow to like turn on and off by a bag Is that what you want to control with primitive alpha? How's that gonna be different from just being a texture Like what if we just take that entire combiner and back into the texture How's that different? Alright, bye I'm back I mean having it more transparent I think might be a good idea Just because the effect is obnoxious right now like it's overdone For me, I think the biggest thing that I don't like about this is the lack of contrast here I think if we added more contrast to it, I would like it a lot better right away I think the ring ones can be darker. Oh, yeah, that's exactly what I just did I'm glad we are on the same page. This one should probably also just start later, right? Dafuq Um, why isn't this doing what I want? The hell How's this not being multiplied by primitive color What the fuck I don't know, can I turn on the head shock? Oh, I didn't assign them a zero, that's why Nope, not what I wanted to do Copy, plus, zero, zero, nine, um, assign, make darker And then just one more layer, one more layer, how bad could it be for performance? How bad could one more layer be? My mom never told me to watch my language, that's like an American thing Normal people do not care if you swear So And a shader to the outer wall so it matches the icicle dark colors we are on the N64 Oh, let's see, you shift the darker shade so it's a brown one, the lighter shade so it's green to inject some extra color, true, that's a good idea And the draw order is inverted from what it should be, cool So All right, let's try your idea with the hue shift Let's add some purple in these Um, some slight blue into this Some light blue into this Some green into that It doesn't feel very green to me Because this one doesn't actually multiply the crimp color, no wonder Oh, not too dark I don't like how dark the green is So I have not beat ARK. I don't care about programming languages, doesn't really matter So I forgot to sort by mesh elements, sort by mesh elements Sort mesh elements by material, there we go Now they should be in the correct order and we should be able to actually look at this There we go It looks like something My favorite is just assembly So The only skilled programming language that actually makes sense to program in So I can't program in any language. It's very simple I've written a bunch of python scripts without ever learning python You just open the python editor and write it And And we probably want to delete the back faces on these um If we are going forward with this At any rate, I think we are okay for today Um, i'm gonna try to inject more contrast into this somehow But this will be the end of the stream So We are gonna keep going next week until then bye-bye
