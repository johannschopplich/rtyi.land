Hello? Welcome. Hello? Hello Access Gamer. Hello, Selton. Hello, Peppy, Brinny. I opened the wrong level. Cool. God, there are so many updates I did recently that I would love to share with everyone, but I have not been able to get around to it. I've started to go over all vanilla Mario 64 code and refactor everything I didn't refactor yet. We're going to see a couple minor upgrades from that. Probably like 4 kilobytes of RAM doing that, which is not a lot. But it is something. What is left to do? The only real engine upgrade left to do is actually porting the new libultra, right? But I am going over all the original vanilla source code again to make sure that I'm actually not using any vanilla code. Every function I didn't write myself, I'm just backspacing it and reimplementing it in my own words, basically. Hello, Jordan. That's good. Hello, Benjamin Savory. We're almost done on the first part of the first overworld, by the way. I'm probably going to look for a test as to test how the first five courses in a row flow. If our gameplay formula is good. Move in. So one consequence of me doing that is that the test stage now works differently. It's no longer the level script thing. The whole concept of S register and level script is gone. Doom OST? I'm not feeling the Doom OST. Yeah, a large chunk of the OS is always the same few people. I'm always surprised to hear how many people are watching my streams. If I look at the YouTube video, it often has almost a thousand views, which is crazy. Any OST wishes for today, though? So yesterday we finished implementing the thing up here and the Yoshi swings, right? So next is the Boobla infestation in Pandora's Box. Let me go to the place and tell you what the plan is for today. Boobla. Yeah, that's an enemy from Yoshi's Island. Hello, Smudge. Last stream we did the two swinging Yoshis here. Unfortunately, they are not showing up right now. And I know why. It's because I don't have the star. Let me just get myself that star here. Do you understand? You should recheck the progress tracker documents. No matching GFX found. Fair enough. That's not a difficult bug to fix, don't worry. See, the thing is, I don't null pointer check. Instead, I just throw an arrow like that and crash the game. So that way, whenever something is wrong in my game, there's 0% chance to miss it. No rendering render. Oof. That means that's Dory. Dory is not rendering fine. Anyway, here's the Yoshis we did last stream. Aren't they cool? Anyway, our next mission is right here. So, this is a ghostly area. After you open the lighthouse, you can actually go to the ship without being walked away. Which leads you here. I meant to do a save state there. Also, we're probably doing Dory's shadow soon. Which is the shadow that actually is in the shape of Mario. Anyway, what's going to happen here is that in a later part of the overworld, you can actually reach this point here. And there's going to be a treasure chest here. And once you open that treasure chest, you opened Pandora's box. And if you open Pandora's box, all the Boobla spawn and they go down here. And you have to beat the Boobla infestation. That was the idea. But now that I look at it, how's the Boobla fight going to be fun? We might need to do a few more things here. How would you even beat the Booblas? Let's see. For those who don't know. Yes, this is the shadow. Look at that. This works without actually rendering Mario. She's just rendering like, I think, seven circles here. Maybe nine. I have that iris for my overworld one, but I'm testing a different place right now. And this is actually a lot cheaper in my engine because I have BVH. So it's no problem at all. Since they're already dead, they cannot be defeated. Okay, they can't be defeated. Okay, if they cannot be defeated, how about we do this a bit differently? What if there is a treasure chest here? And as soon as you open it, the Boobla infestation just begins and it doesn't end for the rest of the game. Like just the act of collecting the star makes it so that the evil spirits are around you forever. You've opened Pandora's box, you cannot close it again. It's a permanent change to the overworld. I think I like that. We could have a nice text with that too. How can I... I guess I have to do that and then subdivide it here like that. I guess that works. Didn't Zana make one? Make one what? Maybe Superstar OST? Alright, fine. Things I wish I knew before. That honestly sounds like a good idea, yeah? What does Pandora's box usually look like? I see. These are kinda nice. I like this one. A box? I don't think she did. We have a treasure chest in a different level. Dang. Where can you find out more about the past 64-bit repository? On the past 64-bit repository you find a good amount of stuff. Oh, Zana making a ship model. I don't think she made one for the overworld. She made the 2D texture here. The problem is the texture only looks good with a stiff camera angle and we don't have that anymore, so... Can you justify their existence in some way if they are haphazard and can't be defeated? Yes, I'm thinking about that part right now. How do we set this up without it feeling stupid? I guess is the thing for me. One way we could do this maybe is... When you open the treasure chest... Maybe it's like... You know, you're gonna unleash evils onto the world that you can't take back all for just a star. Are you sure you want to do this? I don't know what Retro Achievements is. More box shape and less treasure chest shape. Yeah, but that is a good point. If they cannot be defeated and they're here forever, we need to think about what they do. What if you have to use the booblas somehow to get to the star? Are the ghosts going to haunt the Old Lake Peaches courtyard? Yes, but only this part. What do the booblas actually do? I'm loving this 2 FPS video. Do they just attack you? That is a funny idea you need to have. You know when they come up like that? What if that threw you upwards into the sky? What if when the treasure chest is in the overworld, it's shaking? So you know there's something inside it, something living. Maybe we put two chains on it, you kick it once, the first chain falls off. Maybe there's like a dialogue box, you kick it twice... The chain falls off completely, it opens up, you see like particles sparkling out of it. And you see the booblas spawn everywhere. Maybe with like a little cutscene. Maybe a star spawn cutscene here. What is this? Is this Yoshi's Island? Return to Yoshi's Island? Oh god. I remember this guy asking me if he can make one, I think I remember now. That is funny. Right, so we spawned with a cutscene, all the booblas are here. And then maybe you have to get shot up by one of them to actually collect it. Maybe we have to go up next to a thumb or something. That helps blocking the star if it gets scattered in some way. You can always be boasting about how brave it is beforehand. Nah, that's too much. Too complicated. This is important. Nope. We could of course also just have this area be infested by them from the get-go. And see how that works out. But I really like the idea of a treasure chest doing something bad to the level. And it just staying that way. Like, just have them be evil ghosts, right? The only issue I see with it is that players are going to feel really inclined to have to defeat them. No no, the box is great, I'm just thinking about after the box is opened and the guys are all over the place. Players are going to feel like they need to do something with the ghosts to get rid of them or something. And we don't have anything planned in that sense. So I fear that this is going to lead to confusion. Or well, I'm pretty certain it will. Make it clear in the warning text. Hmm. I guess we can do that, where it's like, you kick it once and then it's going to be like... This box contains great evil. Are you sure you want to open it? You cannot put back what you find inside. Nice. Hello, Agent Rifle. Well, maybe once Mario 64 is ported to my engine we'll just get multiplayer for free. That would be neat, wouldn't it? Let's write that plan down real quick and see if we still like it. God, I killed group 1 today. I actually saved a little bit of memory here. How much did I save? I don't know. Probably like 12 kilobytes even. Wow. Yeah, but would you really think of letting them throw you, Benjamin? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yes. So that's why I was thinking maybe you can, like, let them bounce you up. The problem is that players wouldn't think to be bounced up by them. There are no NPCs here, so there isn't really an opportunity for that. And I don't want any here, because this is the ghost area. What are you doing? Modding my Mario? We're right now planning to start here. We could maybe, like, make another extra cliff here, just for the box. To somehow more prominently display the box. Yes. It used to be that I would just make a video and then find a sponsor. But I'm getting so many sponsorship offers that at this point I get an offer before I have a new video ready. So it's kind of the opposite way around. That was interesting that that whopped me. Definitely an issue. Yeah. Hmm. Why a bomb? Bomb. Leela, what are you saying? You're confusing me today. You're making me sad. Boom! Hmm. Let's say we have these booblas everywhere. They're all over the place. And... I guess the star would be down here with them. Let's just pretend the star would be down here with them. Yeah, Leela, I fixed the debug text. Yeah. Well, obviously it has to be done when the game is rendered. Where else would I render the text? Bro, why is this so difficult? Okay. We have our guys. Can we... Do we maybe make it so that you do defeat them? Yeah. Yes, because most text is 60fps. Just not the one from gameplay actors. But gameplay actors are not supposed to put any text at all. So... Like... This is difficult, man. Hmm. Maybe we just accept that the booblas are forever. Is that really so bad? Would players really try to do something with them? The players would definitely try to jump on them to try and kill them. So maybe them shooting you upwards wouldn't be that bad. What if we made a little platforming section here, actually? So let's say you open that and the booblas go everywhere. And the star was here from the get-go. And up there was like a cliff that you had to reach. And the booblas slowly approach you and then shoot you upwards like that. Yes. We do that. That is the best idea by far. Easy. Easy. Nice. I like this. No, Mario 64 is no problem at all in GameCube Controller, I find. Don't worry, I have a plan. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. This is my idea. How high is this? 1.7? That's actually just enough. That's not what I wanted. Did I already make one? Yes! Graham made one last stream. Oh yeah, Lila, how did you like your mention in the video? You seemed so nervous about me saying that the video was going to be funny for you. Did you think I was going to roast you or something? She doesn't know. What do you know? That's true. I apologize for my behavior. I have learned and grown from it. Ooh, attention grabbing! You're worried people would know about you? You wanted to stay obscure? Yeah, let me check if we can just make it up there. So we're probably going to put a star on the last cliff here and then make it so that we need to use the blue blobs to actually get up there. By the seams. Honestly, we don't need them here. I just thought it's a bit nicer. Oh, yeah, we do need the blue smell there as well. It's a bit nicer. Just because it was everywhere else. Yo, Manni! Thank you literally gambling for the 1000 bits. I don't know why I'm not hearing the bits come through. That is a tragedy, because I bet I missed a bunch of bits before. Oops. What do I find? Yes, it has options. You have invert options, you have auto rotation, and you have snappy controls. No, I'm not adding an option to mute the in-game music. Okay, it's just out of reach. And the blue blobs are shooting you this high. Kind of makes sense. And then the last two jumps, it's okay if they're all out of reach. Just the first one should not be. At least not with some silly obvious jump. I think I can make it up there. Wait. Okay. Is it actually not possible? Ah! Okay, maybe it's not possible. Maybe with the first thing. It feels so possible. Okay, it's not possible. Nice, okay, perfect. We don't want it to be possible. Okay. I just want to know where I am. It's because I'm at it with the Splenda. Splenda is a popular 3D modeling software. But we have turned Splenda into a Mario 64 level editor. We in the Mario 64 community. Not me specifically. I contributed very little to this. Okay. Watching you game might be so satisfying, I might just be that good at it. Yes, but it's not going to be anything like that. The start screen is likely going to be like a rotating image of Yoshi's Island. Allegedly they used an editor called nWorld. Why up my cat in the eye in the end that I should make a video where I make a custom Mario level with nWorld? I think that could be pretty funny. Listen to Friend Inside Me? I hate. I have recently heard for the first time that we are going to have a repeat of the Undertale situation. So I don't know if some of you guys are too young to remember this. But when Undertale first came out, obviously it was a great game. Like, people that played it loved it. But also, the people that were posting about Undertale, it attracted the most obnoxious group of people possible. So the internet was kind of ruined for a couple days, months, weeks even. Where Undertale fans would just make the same three jokes over and over. The same inside jokes, they would make them everywhere. And it became really obnoxious. And apparently Deltarune is getting there right now. Which is like interesting, how is Toby Fox able to consistently produce this effect? I learned this when I brought up the drunk driving song, which I thought was fucking hilarious. When I brought it up, I was like, oh my god, I've heard this like 15,000 times, shut up. It's like, okay, I see where Deltarune is getting. I see we're reaching that. I see I have to distance myself from Deltarune so people do not think I'm cringe. You're saying this has to look like the old, it would be really cool to show the old progression that way too. Well, there would be multiple save files, so that's not really possible. But, kinda. Nah. We're gonna have to think of something. I was thinking of just like a rotating view of the island maybe. I'm not actually sure. We'll think of something. I also need to fix the memory error screen. Do you guys know the memory error screen? This is something we had in the very first demo from 2020. I found this recently again in the game files. Look at this. Isn't this cool? I mean, obviously this looks terrible, but the idea is awesome. We are fetuses and you're allowed to kill us? That is true. That is the legal situation in the US. I just realized that saying that makes me sound very anti-abortion. The truth is, I do not care. Hello Kevachten. I'm in my German arc right now. That's why your name is Achten. Murder is legal in the US? What? That image is an in-game file? Yes, I added this. It's Mario telling you you need to install the expansion pack. If the game detects that no expansion pack is installed. I kind of want Pandora's box to be a little lower so you can actually reach it easily. Well, I cannot sell Mario figurines, but otherwise, yes. This idea is not bad. Don't get scammed by Rosenhaus backwards so you can access the star. Oh, I see. This was your idea. It's cute, but I want to use the booblas directly. But this is not a bad idea for something else, maybe. You know what? I'm going to have Zeyna make Pandora's box. I'm just going to put something here for now. As a placeholder model. What am I going to use for the... Can we even use this? I don't use this breakable box ever. I'm going to delete this code. Wait, what did I just kill? Oh, there's two of them. We do use this one. I guess I have to keep that. If you had to be vegan, what would you miss the most? The most? That's a good question. Eating chicken, I guess? I don't know. I don't really think I would miss it. I don't enjoy it very much. It's just a thing I do. I don't need to derive too much joy from food, honestly. I guess protein shake would suck to not have, because I would be missing my nutrients. What's the best part of my gameplay? Your mod or hat on time? That's such an unfair question to ask me. Bro, you want to try to get me fired from my job? The best food is painless, I'll say it like that. Food doesn't mean much to me. I just want to not suffer when I eat. Okay, but that means we can use this. It's an outline from the Norse box. I'm gonna try to run my AI training thing. I want to make a Mario that can just beat Mario 64. I think that would be cool. Okay, I have a hot take for vegan food. If you eat vegan food and the people involved in making it are not vegans themselves, it doesn't count. Same with carbon neutral. If you are producing something and you claim to be carbon neutral, then you better make sure that the carbon produced by the people that survive off of the money you pay them for them to work for you is counted in that. People aren't free. If your mother was passed through bone, you are still vegan. Really? I mean, I guess passed through makes sense, because you didn't actually use it. It just happened to touch it, right? It wasn't an essential part of the process. Then, yes, sure. You're always going to kill something if you eat some animal. Exactly. Roadkill is vegan. Sure. I have an idea for the final boss. It should be free face. Huh? Why? Why any of that? Why does it fit my game specifically? Oh, we can't go? Dang. I thought we were going to go today. That sucks. I didn't say that, Lila. Try a different place. Which one? We would miss ramen. If I had to be vegan, I would miss ramen. Not really. Pretty sure I would just find a different place I would like to eat. Maybe once or twice a year. That would make a big difference to my life. Legit, if the entire world went vegan, and food got cheaper as a result, I think I would like that. I'd rather save 10% of the money that I spend on food than eat meat, if that makes sense. Butaramba? Yeah, I don't want to go to a restaurant where they don't have enough food for me. I did not see that lemon. Isn't good. I mean, it's noodles and fried chicken. Like, I don't miss it, that's good. Would you rather give up C macros or meat? Oh, that's a good question. I guess I can still use inline functions. And just static always inline them in a header. So I'm fine. Dude, what happened to YouTube recently? This video is also doing terribly. Ooh, this one's actually getting less clicks. Ooh, that's not good. Uh oh. Look at these comments. You mean Bom-Om? Bom-Om is a specific Bom-Om he is in Paper Mario. I'm getting comments like this, and I'm getting like 50,000 comments that are like, who called them Bom-Om? I've never seen anyone do that. And then there's guys out here like this, claiming Bom-Om is the right way to do it. I can't believe it. It's Bom-Op? Sure. Sure. DipperFlipsFans, true! I thought they were called Bob-Omps. True. Bob-Omps. I should make sure to mispronounce it all the time to get the engagement from these characters. But I pronounced it right! That's the thing. I call people out for mispronouncing it. That's funny, Mitsu. How are they verifying that? Guys, do they check if you eat meat, and then if you do, you're just not allowed to use the music? Or is it more of a... I don't even know what you could possibly gain from that. Clearly it's not going to work, right? Hello, Samuel. What if I send someone in the meat industry for something I don't afford? Well, you're probably doing that. Alright, now we should have... We should have a talking box here. Guys, if you do not have it on my desk by Friday, that there's a three-phase boss fight, with the first phase being regular Bowser but harder, and then the second phase being a clown car, battle in Mario Party 8, and then in the third phase there's a gamed Bowser like Yoshi Island, I will come to your house and I will do things to you. Last one, in case. I can do that, Zeyna. Why was there no collision? Because I forgot to run the function for it. Let me send you one of the star selects real quick, and then we continue this. Where are the stars? Menu? No text? Okay, no text is showing up. It might be that I already have the save flag, which would suck. What even is the debug text here? I actually don't know. Something keeps printing to the screen and I'm not even sure what that is. Action is to get rolls, it should be. Okay, that's not the issue though. Does the hit check not work? It's one. It's still one. Oh. Suffering. Alright, now I should get the text and then after that we should get the box open. Okay, perfect. So the box works. Obviously it still needs animations and stuff. We could definitely do that skip, but we're going to make that not be able. Don't call him Bom-Bom, that's weird. Hey Kaze, I don't know if anyone asked this before, but do you and the magic people that makes video games with you have any plans for making an original game in the future? I definitely want to make original games in the future. Probably after RTYI. Or maybe even we can turn RTYI into an original game. We'll have to see. You always called it Bom-Bom? No way. You're trolling now. Okay, the way I actually think it should go is, instead of trying to make rules like that, you should try to incentivize people to act in the way that benefits humanity. You know what I mean? Make it so that egotistically it makes sense for people to be vegan. If this is actually important to you as the state. That's what you should be lobbying for. If you want people to be vegan, if you want to save the planet, you shouldn't be vegan. You should lobby for there being more incentives to be vegan. People are always like this stupid fake Immanuel Kant ideology where it's like, just live after the rules that you want to be enforced by everyone and everyone will be fine. It's not how it works. So let's say you get a law passed that says if you buy purely plant-based foods then the state pays 10% of your grocery bill. That would be amazing, right? That would incentivize people to be vegan and you would be happy to be it, right? You would reward people for being good people. Isn't that what you want? Doesn't that make sense? So I always say I would never be vegan myself, but I definitely would be in favor of there being rewards for being vegan. And maybe if there's rewards, I don't know. vegan myself, who knows. But it only works if you assume people are purely rational actors, which is comical. Nah, you don't need to be purely rational for that. Let's say you make plant-based food entirely free. Like even people that don't act 100% rational would be more likely to buy plant-based foods. I think doing it at the micro-level, starting with yourself is the wrong approach. You shouldn't even start with yourself, you should start with society as a large, if you actually want to make a difference. But around black markets with cheap fakes? I mean that kinda does that, right? This incentivizes getting the rhino stuff, because there's going to be a very high chance that whatever you get is fake. Do as I say, not as I do, yes, but genuinely. Or well, at that point it would be, do what's best for you, and I just happen to change the rules in a way where what's best for you happens to be what I want people to do. It's game design! I'm certainly funding arguments out of medical necessity, not by choice. I mean, I get where you're coming from, but we already use taxpayer money to try to improve the place we live in, so wouldn't this be in the same category? Where is grayscale? Here. Ah, not indexed. Don't they somehow think having social distancing is such a people's primary concern? Yeah, I mean definitely not. But I do think that if you model people's behavior on a payout matrix, they are going to gravitate towards the higher-paying options. People genuinely try to make the decisions that are good for them, even if they're not 100% rational all the time. Oh my god, this guy really wants that Bowser battle. Wait, I feel like I've seen this model wrong. Oh, the black ring around the eyes is in the other texture, I see. You think it's rationally subjective, though? Of course, yes. I mean, we all have different priorities in life. I mean, what I've described just now has been tried before in Canada with the carbon tax, and people fucking hate it. But I think it was a good idea. Probably just done terribly. Would you end the game with a five-phase boss battle? Are you going to be in a clown car, and are you going to be ganked? Decision-making things which aren't cultural? I mean, for corporate tax structures, it works really well, right? And we do it there. But I don't see why it wouldn't work for cultural things. Like, let's say they made it so that if you wanted a Christmas tree, it's going to cost you $10,000. Surely that's going to cause quite a few people to not have a Christmas tree. So, I mean, obviously it would be terrible for the government to do that, but I think that example proves that it's possible to do that. Guys like you think your idea is very good. You make a convincing argument. Bull-bomb, bull-bomb, bee-bomb? No. I'm still wondering how I'm going to animate these guys. Maybe we just have a blob here, and then every now and then this just scales up out of the blob? Maybe that's the way to do it? Like, one of you and... And then back into the blob? I think that's actually good. We might actually have to make some double faces here, which kind of sucks, but yeah. Otherwise we lose back face culling, which would be even worse. Bom-bom-bom video, I am glad you like it. Yeah, if we see this tongue from this angle and it just doesn't render, that would be weird. Ooh, that's nice. You mean bom-bom video? I've literally never heard anyone call it bom-bom. You're stupid. I had to quote my YouTube comments at you. Okay, how the fuck is this going to downscale? Huh? Oh, that's not going to look good. It does answer. My entire PC is frozen? Uh-oh. This is an enemy called Boobla. Yeah, my PC is frozen. Fuck. I hope it doesn't crash. Guys, if I get a blue screen, I might have to go. Chill day today, huh? Okay, Windows Task Manager, save me. Ooh. Honestly, it doesn't look as awful as I thought it would be, but there's certainly issues here. I don't think we can give this the okay. I think this is a little too rough. Dang. Man, most parts of this texture aren't even used. That's frustrating. Hmm. It would probably be a platformer, Meepo. What? I don't think I'm saying it will be released soon. I'm saying I'm in the final stages of making the game, which I am. I'm just making the overworld now. What did I say last video? Can you quote it verbatim and then I will explain it? Yeah, this UV map just loses too much resolution. Shit. I would kind of like to replace them with vertex colors. Which we can, actually. Right? We can. Almost done. Ah, I guess, I, yeah. If that is what I said, I can definitely see how that would give people false hope. That they shouldn't be saying that. Oh my god, he's not giving up. I'm going to be using his model as a guideline here. And with the colors and everything, but I don't think we can use this texture here. I'm not even showing up in your chat, but you can see it on stream. You can see it in Twitch chat. He doesn't even know I'm talking about him, I just keep doing it. I'm baffling with the specimen. This kind of reminds me of the Pokemon Golbat. You know how Golbat looks, and it's like, where does his tongue even go? Oh nice, Radiant, that's good to hear. The tongue does look really good, so I might take just the tongue from the texture. Nope, it's from Yoshi's Island. Is there, like, a smooth brush I can use in this program? Huh. My hand slipped. How do I delete just this part of this? Like that? Yep. Now Anchored, please. Okay. Hmm, that's not good. Please say yes. Please. Please. I haven't answered any of my questions, and you just keep asking me the same thing. See, if you wanted to have a conversation with me about your boss idea, you should have answered some of my questions. Now I can't take you serious. Now you just look like a smart child. Which I'm sure you're not. What are you talking about? Me? No, no, you're definitely right. You're definitely right, Tato. That level is pre-rework. We are absolutely going to use something else than what we have right now. What we have right now is not great looking. It does not fit the art style, is what I mean. It does look fine, it just doesn't fit the art style. What is your question? You didn't see it? I asked why is that fight specifically suited to the game I am making, more so than any other game in the world? Why would it be in my game and not some other game? What makes my game suited for that? Dude, the game blocked my PC again. What is going on? You want to know what my question is? I literally just gave you the question. What is your question? I literally just gave you the question. What is your question? Here I go. You don't see him? You only see him show up on chat and not in your own stream chat? That's weird. Did YouTube ban them from commenting publicly? Here is your attention, you have no elevator pitch. Are you trying to sell me an elevator? Mario World and Yoshi's Island have completely separate enemies. So the clown car, I am absolutely not on board with. But what you said about a giant Bowser, is kind of what we had planned. And it was going to have elements from the original Mario Kart. Oh, it needs more triangles. That's the issue. Duh. Alright, what do you think of the finished Boobla? I think it now works. And don't reboot. True. And the way I want the fight to work, or them to work in general, is they're usually like this and inside a blob. And then every now and then they pop out like that. The question is, how do we make this work? Because we can't just leave the blob there, right? Oh, the blob actually looks very similar. If you're in Double Time, when this happens, you get launched. Yes. Make him thicker and scaler. Well, making him thicker isn't really as simple as you make it sound right now. At least I don't see an option to make him thicker. Oh, he's way too small. He needs to be around 20 times that size. 200 times that size, actually. Do people want this? I mean, this isn't a democracy. I kinda get that aside. This is my sleepover and I get to pick the movie. Someone asked me to tier list the Mario World, Mario Kart World song. They wanted me to tier list this one. Do you know which song this is? Does anyone know which song this is? Anyone? One person? Yep, it's fucking Peach's Castle. It starts like that? I'm gonna give this a low tier, man. I hate this. There is no template. Importing a custom model like that can be fairly difficult. Are you on D-Comp or on Binary? I think that makes a big difference. I have the rotator wrong. What do you mean this gets a low? It's shit! This song sucks! This is literally the worst remix of the Castle I have ever heard. It is worse than the original. You guys genuinely like this? It's just random doodling. I don't like jazz. I don't like jazz. While they asked me to tier list it, this is my tier list. I get to pick the result. Fuck. I added a null to this bone. I didn't mean to do that. Come on, one person said yes. Do you understand how much work that is? I'm not doing it because one person said yes. I can't just press a button and that magically does it. I have to spend many many hours. Do you think if Shigeru Miyamoto was streaming he would get comments like that? People asking him to implement something a certain way? He definitely would. I don't know what they are talking about. This is the thing with playtesters. They never really know what they want. When you get feedback on your game you should never look at what they are actually saying. You should just look at what they are feeling. Ugh. I missed this one vertex. No, I exported to group 0. Hydration memory. Alright. I'm glad you liked it. Let's see if the algorithm has finally picked it up. It's about average. I had to change the title. The title used to be perfecting Mario 64's Bob-omb. That video did awful. Now it's called my Mario 64's Bob-omb must be reworked. It's doing alright. Just another proof that you need to be somewhat sensationalist. I mean that makes sense right? You have your design goal at first and you need to work towards that design goal. I'm just saying, a lot of the time a player will be like, I don't like this part. Please change it so that X. And you have to discard the change it so that X. You just have to be like, okay they don't like this part, let's figure out why. Like they might be completely wrong about that. Have you guys ever heard of this phenomenon where there's an illness where people are blind, but they entirely deny that they're blind. It's kind of like that. Like the people they are blind and they don't know that they're blind, they vehemently agree, argue against the idea that they're blind. And I think game design is like that in a lot of ways. Yeah, it's a crazy illness. To think people could be blind and not believe that they are blind. And you guys thought Pirate Software was bad. Sorry. You got all silly YouTube drama. How blind are they? Like 100% blind. So we could have them sneak around like this first and then just jump up. From birth? No, not from birth. How's it going? They are blind. Anton syndrome. Those that are cautically blind but affirm often quite adamantly in the face of clear evidence of blindness that they are capable of seeing. Failing to accept being blind. Confabulation to fill the missing sensory inputs. They just make shit up I guess. Only 28 cases still, like that's kind of a lot. It's mostly after a stroke. Huh. What is this enemy? It's Booblar. From Yoshi's Island. What is this enemy? I don't know. What is this enemy? I don't know. What is this enemy? I don't know. Hmm. What is this enemy? That kind of works, but eh. It's too scary you gotta turn off stream? Dang, okay. This guy, but I don't think it'll be funny after he pops out, he's just waving his arms around like he's trying to scare you. The idea for him was that... Yes, actually waving his arms around and scaling up and down is the idea. I'm just not sure if I like the pop-up animation so far. We could also just... We could cheat a little bit. I think we might have to. I think we might have to. Okay. Like what if it's like this? He just appears and then pops back out. Maybe we could even have a few more frames of anticipation here. I kinda like that. I think that should be the basic pattern. Ah. Why are his arms doing that now? Oh I see. Okay I see. Okay. Oh. What if we have nerds? I like them. Okay. Okay. Hmm. I think that's almost good, but I should move this one further down. Okay that's nice. Except the frame rate is down, it's no longer good. I like these effects though. I think this is what we'll do. Honestly I have no idea how unrealistic it is for a dishwasher to run Mario 64 at this point. But like technology has advanced so much it might actually be reasonable. By representing the thesis that Super Mario Styles had some effect on me is true. He's wearing down my subconscious. It's going to start working any second. 3, 4, 4 is what we'll use. No shadow because they're ghosts. And they're on the floor. Yeah I feel like there are dishwashers that are more powerful than the N64 at this point. That's a correct function. Nope. I suddenly feel an urge to go gambling. Anyone else? Dude I've been thinking I should get into gambling. Like on Poly Market. Double all your money in an instant, yeah. What if you get to lose all your money? No I'm thinking specifically Poly Market. All you have to do is be schizophrenic and you will make a lot of money. Yes Red Lux, that's the Pokemon casino music. Imagine were a zombie. Yeah like Fentanyl is probably a worse zombie. Yeah. Oh, I know what I did. I linked to that condition. Please do it, please do it, please do it. When you said please the first time I didn't really want to do it. Then when you said it the second time, I still didn't want to do it. But when you said it the third time, I still didn't want to do it. Please try again please. When you said it the fourth time, I wanted to do it a little less again. It looks like the emulator doesn't support Pac-Man almost quite yet, but that's fine. We also need to make him pop his eyes back out at the end. Bom-bombs, you will die. You guys need to up one and down one. Yes, yes, definitely. No, I agree. And I also see how they might need to be slowed down. Obviously, they will not be permanently triggering like this. So the way I envision it is that they are in this state here most of the time and they're just kind of walking along the overworld. And then when you get near them, they will walk under Mario and shoot him up like that. And then when they shoot you up, that will allow you to get up here. You get to start here. Anyway, I'm kind of feeling done for today. So I will see you guys next stream, which is probably going to be on Monday. Since I have Monday off, I might be doing a bonus stream. So until then.
