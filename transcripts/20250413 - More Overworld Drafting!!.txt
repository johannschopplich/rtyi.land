The fifth half O fifth fifth    hello dragon cap man i'm listening to a banger today hello clayman hello wiguna more? no way? what do you mean no way? what are we no waying at? dude i've been working on refactoring audio this was like what is it 25 percent 25 percent is no 12.5 bigger i sped up audio code again by 12.5 percent at least somehow and i'm still finding new improvements i'm not even fully done yet dude the original audio is so dark shit it's crazy hello sultan any ost wishes for today hello papi prinny you know what we're listening to this wait never mind this song is offensive i can't listen to it hello ashen gore metroid prime oh i don't have the space here how many times you do overworld drafting well we gotta get the overworld perfect it's a big fucking level dude and it's the most important level in the game you better get it right how many do we have 16 21 and we have one two three one one two three so we need 15 secret stars well actually we already have five secret stages one two three four five so we're missing 10 more secret stars right 21 overworld stars and then we have a total of 180 stars that's perfect three stars from brother our bosses i think that's fine we can make the last puzzle give a star yeah um man that fucking chat today no ost wishes that's crazy spyro ost let's do it okay so we had 11 out of 21 stars that are planned where do you find the myth saurus egg i've only found the old demo there's only the old demo i only played the old demo because she canceled the entire hack otherwise i would not have played it hello yoshi bobby um so one idea that was brought up today is that once you do certain actions npcs from the worlds would visit the overworld and i said i'm fine with that if they have a purpose so maybe we can tie the npcs that are coming out of levels to some stars but also i would really like to tie some of the yoshis into stars so rebuilding the yoshi's houses for them um i want that to do something maybe there's otherwise you can help the yoshis maybe there's like a harvesting minigame i think i got it from rhtc or from her discord i don't remember  all right there's only 14 overworld parts now i forgot but yeah we definitely need more yoshi stars so the yoshi's being happy is one of them i think a harvesting minigame would be cool where you help them harvest something or maybe like a harvesting lottery like oh for 15 coins i'll let you harvest one of my watermelons and then you ground pound it and there might be a star in there how the yoshi egg hatch hmm that could be a good one that could be a good event like a yoshi just laid an egg and you need to help him somehow like maybe maybe he just laid an egg and you have to find a warm binky for him and then later he hatches so  so what would you do to help the yoshi egg hatch so the idea of just permanently spawning in a new yoshi on the island is so cool so how does the dory thing work again oh i see that makes sense i mean a warm binky is like perfect for hatching an egg or a warm blanket but it would be awkward to carry around a blanket he immediately goes to work in the yoshi mine it's true yeah i have done a few of those i think you'll very much like those hello akire so in general in your discord it's on irl gamecube and wii dev kits it's kind of cool that it exists so how to hatch an egg you just need an incubator hmm so how to help the yoshi true kaki wouldn't that be cool we are born in the 1900s i was born in the 1900s and they didn't let me in on the n64 games so maybe there just should be a yoshi egg that hatches over time and you don't actually do anything for it and the yoshis are very much capable of taking care of themselves so the egg just just happens and then maybe you do something with the baby yoshi it is Spyro 5 actually because i'm being able to catch the one of your streams love your working videos hello welcome to the stream we're currently planning out the overworld events we need 10 more stars in the overworld to make it complete and i'm very sure we can do it somehow but i'm thinking of good stars lava steam the incubator open a hot water basin it'll work in it to warm the sand or maybe it needs to be placed to be comfy or the eggshell is too thick and it's just difficult to break out yeah the eggshell being like tough is a fun idea so maybe at x plus y stars the egg just starts hopping around and it's like i can't break out get me out of here maybe you can talk to the egg and the egg says get me out of here and then you break him out of there maybe he tells you that he will repay you and the next time you enter or maybe like an hour after that in real game time he gives you a star i think that's a fun idea let's see that let's do it yeah the egg is ready to hatch but he can't get out so you see the egg still crazy and jump up and down when you come near the egg there is a text box can break the egg with a punch or ground punch after you've broken the egg he thanks you and tells you that he will have that he will repay you come back one hour or more of real time to get a three star i don't know if i like one hour of real time but i think it works maybe we should also have like an alternate condition or if you have 170 plus stars so that way if you're at the end of the game and this is the last star you get then he instantly has to start for you a squash and stretch is difficult to use in animations because it's not supported by mars 64's engine and i am hoping to eventually get cauterinian animations in which would be a new format that would allow for squash and stretch and doesn't have anything to do with cauterinians themselves it's just the format is better the one that we thought up but i haven't implemented it yet so it's not possible that's true pappy but i don't want to add a bunch of unnecessary power-ups it's the format that allows it khaki not the quaternions i think i made that pretty clear well it is easy to support it just isn't supported right now um when mario's hand scales they have like a special function for that it's actually part of the animation no there's nothing to do with quaternions i mean if you encode something else in quaternions then they're not really quaternions anymore they're just numbers everything is numbers but actually i kind of do because quaternions have 65536 values right and zeros there so we have more negative values than positive values so what i'm gonna do is the max negative value on a quaternion is gonna represent that scale is gonna follow instead of quaternion coordinates they just do it in the behavior code ketan it's not an animation in the sense that like animation is like a bone thing i mean of course it's animated but like you know what i mean anyway more yoshi interactions so i think that a harvest thing would be cool where you have to harvest something so maybe the harvest would be like palm trees because palm trees are easy to harvest you can just punch them the mole blacksmith right the mole blacksmith uh he's just gonna be here for the gold tooth how do you actually meet the mole blacksmith i didn't think about that at all  maybe after you beat the mole mission is there gonna be a mole blacksmith wait oh okay let's let's do this the monty mole smith only becomes available after you beat the monty mole mission to grandson badland this is perfect because grandson badland is right here via the train station so we can make it so that once you beat the mole there they're gonna be like okay i'm sorry for being a dickhead i will actually help you out now more or less work than what is of course it's less work than matrices matrices is like i think 37 multiplications quaternion is like 16 max but no we're still going to have to multiply matrices we're actually going to have to make a matrix out of quaternions because if we just multiply quaternions then we lose the translation and that's not good we don't want everyone to animate at the world origin with no  okay let's think about the levels and if there's a character that we can make from there then would give us a star so bunny brushwoods obviously has a ton of bunnies it also is the goomba king the goomba king i think is funny because the goomba king is like i'm done being with these minions So if he came to the overworld to do something, that would be great. I'm kind of imagining him to just like come to the overworld and sit at the beach and just start fishing. He's like, yeah, I'm done, dude. I'm done being with these goons. They're so stupid. They keep dropping the bolt on my head. I kind of want that. Imagine him just chilling here, fishing forever. He's done being evil. The Black King appears here after you've beaten his mission in Bunny Brushwoods. He's fishing at the shore, still complaining about his inept minions. He never actually catches a fish though. Another boulder hitting him in the overworld. Oh, that's mean. But no, come on, man, the guy has suffered enough. We can't have him just chill at the beach. You know what? As character growth, he no longer wears his crown. We'll do that. He's not going to wear the crown anymore. He's going to be like, I'm done being king. I don't see how he would lead to a star, but he is a very funny idea. So that's why I want him. That's true, but I don't see how, you know, you hit them with a boulder and roll a two or three. I don't know what that is. Now for the Divine Dino Domain, there isn't really much of a story going on. The whole story here is passive. As in, you discover the story rather than experiencing it. And it's like a story that I would have asked. But maybe once Biobank's rework is done, I would have some ideas for this. But right now, there's nothing. Let me just keep this card open. Dude, I was supposed to upload a video today, but Squarespace is slow as hell. So my sponsor code didn't work. And that sucks. If he wants to fish or gets what he needs to fish, he can catch a star with his haul. Yeah, I mean, we could easily implement a side mission where you help him fish and then that does something. But for now, I think it's fine to just have him be here as a character. Yeah, Divine Dino Domain. I mean, there's a bunch of Shy Guys here. So we could easily say something like, okay, the Shy Guys flee from here and now they're here. But honestly, I think that's poopy. So let's not do that. This one is interesting. This is Rainbow Grotto. Rainbow Grotto has the story with the Nippers that are trying to be friendly at first. But then it turns out they were the villains. With the DJ Piranha. And... Boonard, the friendly boo. Helps you prank people. But I think Boonard just really likes to sit in his shack. And that actually is something you get from interacting with him during the acts after the story is finished. So maybe that's not the right play. But... We did want Boonard's wife to appear somewhere in the game. So maybe that's an idea. My dear wife Poetress, I love my boo very much. I'm a very lucky boo to have her. So what if there was a statue somewhere in the overworld? And Boonard's wife is stuck on the statue. Okay. Let's be setting up one joke and then calling it a day. That joke... That one is mental illness. It is approximating a ground truth. With a big principle. That's not necessarily always the best. Or even true. But don't worry. We will just make a good thing without relying on principles or rules like that. Hello AzaEasy. What's up? Aza, I have planned your level into the overworld. It's going to be over here. This is going to be full of oil. And then you beat the big evil oil block boss in course 11. And then the let's players go to your level. Isn't that cool? Okay. New name for you today? Am I not calling you always AzaEasy? AzaEasy? TinoTurning? Anyway. Booatrice. Boatrice? I for sure want Boatrice to appear somewhere. Maybe she's just a very faint easter egg. Something that's hard to see. I think it would be really funny if the Bowser animatronic is what made her freeze. If you remember, Boos are shy. And when you look at them, they kind of try to disappear. So what if that animatronic is what made her shy? What if just opposite of here, Up there you could see Boatrice being shy as hell. Maybe we could even make Mario go up there and talk to her somehow. What would he get for that? Just like coins? And she would only show up after you've gotten all stars in Rainbow Grotto. She doesn't give you anything anymore. I think I like that. Yeah, fuck it. We'll do that.  Opposite of Bowser's mech, Boatrice is shy and scared. She only appears after all 7 stars in Rainbow Grotto. Maybe Yoshi coins. Talking to her just gives you 5 coins and a new Boonart text box. Also gives you a new credit scene for Rainbow Grotto maybe. You get an ultra super cool mega sound effect. Oh, from Boonart. No. Was the microcode the reason Portal 64 was cancelled? This sounds crazy to me. First off, the reason Portal 64 was cancelled, in my opinion, is because the guy didn't want to work on it anymore. And I get it. It's like it sucks. Then after that, I think the reason he was told that Valve would not support his project, which is the reason that he cancelled it, because he had hoped Valve would support it, and they didn't, I thought was that he was using Libultra. Rather than the microcode. Or was it because Libultra is easy to replace, but the microcode? Oh no, we can't deal with that. Libultra is not a microcode. Libultra is an operating system. But Libultra is fairly easy to replace, and it's not that much work to replace. The microcode though, FAD, is going to be a lot more difficult to replace. Why did he do all of that, instead of inserting a face? That's a good question. I could have just insert. I guess I wanted it to be a face.     Maybe in the middle. Honestly, I still have to figure that one out. Oops, I exported the wrong level. Oh. This is a weird blender file, because it has two levels in it instead of just one. Uh-oh. Oh god, this is going to take forever. But yeah, I still use FADX3, which still is not a microcode that you can legally just use and sell your game. However, if I was to ever make a PC part of this, then the microcode would not be part of it, because the microcode has to be emulated anyway. So it wouldn't matter. I don't know what Nujen means. So right here could be... Buatris's Cove. And we're just gonna put like five coins in there before. Or maybe like a blue coin switch. Yeah, let's do that. Talking to her... Just insert here... Bring the grotto... In her place is also a blue coin switch, so the alcove isn't useless beforehand. Mmm, grey world, true. Are you considering making the next version of your hacks? Once you are done with hacking, well, make that a PC port. What? Schizo posting? What do you mean? Are you asking if I'm gonna turn this into a PC port once I'm done? Or what is this next version thing? Alright, that's Buatris done. Next, the zoo. Okay, the zoo is cool. The zoo has Vario, who is leaving. Once you're done with hacking, will you start hacking the PC port? No. He's talking about Recomp, which is better, but what does hacking Recomp mean? Recomp is not a thing you hack, it's a program. Hello Liliana Ufo. Okay, so this one's cool, because we have both Vario exiting the zoo, and then he has to be somewhere. And then we also have the penguins. So what if Vario just sold you one overpriced star? What if he just sold you a star for a thousand coins once he's evicted? I think that would be a good one. What if he just sold you one single star for a thousand coins? I think that's good. We definitely need coins to have a purpose here. How do you make sure the hub world is compact enough to minimize unused space and unnecessary walking? This is why we're doing drafts first. It allows us to just move stuff around very easily without being painful. That way we don't have that issue. I'm not sure if you saw the early streams, but during the early streams I moved a lot of stuff around and made overworlds shorter and shorter. I can walk around you for a second and then you can tell me if it's too long. So this is your first dynamite ticks that needs to be there. And then this is the overworld where you actually are. And I guess you could argue that this is a bit of a long empty stretch. But hopefully once we make the overworld there will be more stuff to do there. This is cool I think. I guess there's still a little bit of long empty stretches like this. So definitely still got some work to do to improve that. Also this. Yeah, we definitely need to improve that still. So I guess we haven't made sure yet, but don't worry about it. With the power of drafting we will easily be able to iron those kinks out. Bro is a magician. Next we got Ghoul Guy Galleon. Ghoul Guy Galleon has the captain, but I feel like he is not a character that should leave his ghost ship ever. Ecliptus, what is this? Leaving? Once you don't know how to hack, will you start hacking the PC port? No. There's a good amount of disgust in that no. That's a good no. Will the package be violated by the later? Something where we have to scam the player with buying a Star Citizen music and kind of annoying to the player? You are correct that that's a little basic. I don't think it's annoying though. I mean if we at some point have a bad idea, then I'm definitely up for changing it. Is there a way to make the rope bridge a smoother bar, you know, like in real life? Yes, there is. I actually have done that in course 5 and course 2 already. I will probably add that to course 1 and I'll definitely add it here. So no, I don't think we want to make any ghosts leave here. There's also already the ghost mission here, so there would be double ghosts and that's not good. Hello audio atmosphere. This cave here is interesting. There needs to be something in the cave. Zelda, we finished the ghost level 3 years ago. We're not adding ghost versions of characters to it now. I'm not adding Goomba pirates into the cave. No, I was thinking like a platforming challenge or maybe like a difficult to see thing. When a ghost is looking for a purpose after being evicted from their pirate ship, they need a new haunt. Well, there is. Okay, I will explain this again. There is a treasure chest here that you can open and once you open it, you open Pandora's box and a bunch of the Gooby Wooby ghosts from Yoshi's Island come out and you have to beat them to get a star. So there are kind of wandering ghosts like that, like banished ghosts. I'm not interested in doubling up on that. So what I'm thinking here is if there was a cave that you can't really see the entrance room from this direction, but you can see it from this direction, or maybe something glowing. Maybe some glowing mushrooms that grow on the ceiling walls would be cool. And then you have to climb along the mushrooms. Thank you from Marika, GBA has a pirate ship in the background that shoots cannonballs at the player. Is such a thing planned for your mod? There is an actual pirate ship attacking as an event here. Hello Sonic the Hedgehog. We are planning the overworld. Do you hear video game music, except Mario music? Sonic maybe? Sonic has pretty great music. Yeah, I need an idea for the cave. The cave sucks right now. Yeah, Sonic game music is like 10 out of 10 and then Sonic games is just like 4 out of 10. It's almost disrespectful to the music composers. I hear somebody say they need an idea. We always need ideas. I'm currently thinking about the best way for the cave. I think the cave needs a secret star somehow. I was thinking we're gonna put glowing shrooms in this cave here and that would look cool. Would kind of fit well with like the glowing crystals being on that side. Actually, we need glowing crystals here. We need this to look like the back entrance to Course 3. What if this was the back entrance to Course 3? Oh, awesome! I ran the beta test of Course 3 and it went pretty well. I think this is a very solid level now. I also ran a beta test of Course 11 and unfortunately I fucked up and made the game crash everywhere. Because I was testing my render function and I didn't notice it so RAM corrupted itself at runtime. But what they did play so far showed that all our designs were working as intended. And they seemed to think the level was really funny, which is good. So I'm starting to run a lot more beta tests. I'm actually gonna send people ROMs with individual levels. Just so we can get feedback on what needs to change. And I'm finding so many super minor improvements. It's very good. Anyway, I think the crystal caves should have a back entrance. Or the rainbow grotto. Daring today, aren't we, bro? I need to do something. But I think the back entrance to the stage being here would be way cooler. This is part of the improving Mario Kart 64 project and a game that works on N64. This game works on Nintendo 64 but it's unrelated to Mario Kart 64. And yes, this is the game that I optimized the source code for. What if... The back entrance to the level put you behind the mirror? What if you were able to go behind the mirror? I don't know what that would do. Cool. True biomech. No front to this level, but... What's the word? This doesn't feel as juicy as our other levels, you know what I mean? The other levels are so juicy. This is so whitewashed. The other ones are like... I'm bad with words. That is daring, Biobank. You've never been able to go behind the mirror. I don't know what you would do behind the mirror, but imagine if you could go there. Maybe that's not good. Because what if you just go behind there and there's nothing there? And then it's like, okay, what's the point of that? Mario 64 DS did it. The stage looks amazing. Well, I mean, it looks fine. Compare it to this area here. This area here actually looks pretty good. You can instantly see like, okay, this is much juicier. Haha. No, I mean, it's obviously still great looking. It's just not as juicy. I think it's the intense colors that are missing, because it's so white. Nice. Okay, so if we don't do a back entrance for this level, what do we do in that cave? There has to be something hinting at the fact that the Crystal Cave is right here. Because this is the Rainbow Grotto entrance, and then this is where the cave is. There has to be some relation. We could have rail ride tracks here. Can we get a secret mirror entrance and some hint to go into the mirror and the power-up that allows us to play? No! We have no secret entrance, but we can see part of the level from the cave and vice versa. Hmm. Do you want to play it again from the background? It's nothing. A feeling of connectivity. Oh, it's a strong fucking light there. Hmm. I can't really see which part of the level you would see. I think it's just the floor texture that's really the problem. Pile. Favourite level and quest of the Mario games that you've played? I remember liking the fantasy of that level on Mario Sunshine that gets flooded with goop a lot. Easy Maze Cave is pretty good, Bombs Fortress is pretty good. Hmm. This is tough. Minor Expert combined instantly makes the lights look 200% better. I'm pretty sure this alone will make it look a lot better. True. What I actually did for most of the level is use these additive lights here, which kinda serve the same purpose, but they are pretty expensive. And they don't look that good. There is no such part that would be pretty, except like behind the mirror, but obviously that's not a real part. They don't add up to you at all? Well, they are fake additives, so fair point. Yeah, they're not really additive. Well, you can see a little bit of additiveness here. But yeah, it doesn't look that good. We're not sure. No, Dennis, just no. I disagree. Sometimes just sitting on one thing for a long time is good, it puts you on the right headspace. It is like a mix between decon and additive, but yeah. I agree with you that your new combiner will look a lot better. What's above the secret cave part anyway? It's a mountain. We still gotta actually put like a mountain here, so that this overworld actually makes any sense at all. Yeah. Most of this is mountains and forests with just some stuff in between. Like if you look at this, this is all mountain, this is all forest. This whole thing here is forest. Behind here is forest, and then this is all mountain. Come to think of it, I've never really defined this mountain here. Let's do that real quick. Like so. I think we'll be anti-merry, we'll need to at least give the place something we want it to do. That's probably the most logical background we can come up with, that would be great. The problem is, we only have 7 stars in that stage, so there's nothing we can really give the play on. We actually even have more than 7 stars in this place, because there's a boo that's mauling his wife, who is stuck being stared at by a statue. And then here's gonna be the statue, and there's gonna be the boo, and she already gives you nothing. She's just a new text box, if you find her. And she is supposed to be like a super important thing. She's gonna give you like a special credit scene, I guess. This is kind of not too good on this part of the overworld. I think I will just connect it like so. Hello MarkMax. But no, we don't need this to go into the level, we just need to ensure that being in here makes you feel like you can see part of this level here. So you get the sense that hey, I'm physically right next to this level. This whole island is actually connected. That's what we want the player to notice. We don't actually need this to have any gameplay implication, we just want the feeling of interconnectivity. How about glowing mushroom fruit that extends into the level itself? Yeah, that is a decent idea. Yeah, glow crystals emerging from walls was also my idea. Or, you know, the minecart tracks. We do have these minecarts here, that could definitely just fall out of there. It's not direct enough. It does have a risk of the player missing it. This area goes through the overworld part. That is a very cool idea. Let me think about where that would be. But we need to make sure that you can't get to the overworld from there. Just remember that you can just walk this path back up. But I'm not opposed to having this go through the overworld. It could be really, really cool. So we have to go through the overworld here. We just need a way to make it so the player can't get back up. And wait, we also need to make sure the player can't get to the level from the overworld. Because imagine if you get here and now you just have to walk down these. That would be poopy. I'm trusting this one well now. Yeah, you can just put it on a NaviDrive. I can just press this button here. And it's on my semi-garage. Yaday! And it runs just like that on N64. This is a banger level on N64. Have you ever seen an N64 game look this beautiful? Man. Yeah, I was thinking of a window too. Like a great panel. That just goes to the overworld. But that feels so cheap. Welcome to the room where you use mushroom-like stuff to act as grids. You can see through it, but not go through it. Make it more accessible. Not as bad for 190p. Doesn't count. And also doesn't look as good. That's insulting. Hmm. What if we have an image of the overworld mapped to a big crystal? And the crystal has environment mapping to warp the image. What if we have an image of the overworld mapped to a big crystal? Is there an image of it anywhere? How is it so hard to find a reflection? Show me the crystal! You asshole! Sorry. 32x32. Yeah, that is a problem. Hmm. Hmm. So maybe that ruins the plan. I do not control the Twitch chats unfortunately. I have no choice but to allow them, otherwise there will be even more ads. What is going on with my audio? Is this in Spiral? It is. There was a comment on the video that was complaining about it. Okay. We can't make the infinite happy hole visible, that's a bad spot. I also don't like making the ice caves visible. What if we just say fuck it and break down an entire wall and that entire wall just shows the overworld? Would that be terrible? It can't be this wall. It would have to be a wall over here. Yeah, like this wall here to the right. What if we break that down and that just shows the overworld? The mirror is actually... I like that. That is going behind the mirror without going behind the mirror. I'm daring today, aren't I? Yeah, making the mirror one way is perfect. Alright, let me note that down. The mirror into the rainbow grotto is one way. You can see through the mirror from this side and look into the level. I don't see the link, I think YouTube killed it. Okay, so we have the mirror here. Then we also need the crystals around here. There is no way around it, unfortunately. Throwing crystals on the wall next to the rainbow grotto. And we need a secret star here. There just needs to be a star here. I think without a star we are lost. Yeah, I'm not sure what to do. But anyway, we are not going with the reflection idea. So it doesn't matter actually. Which is the fire, ice melt and the big house I want to go with the glowing mushrooms. I didn't say glowing mushrooms. I said we need the glowing crystals because it's right next to crystal caves. If they are not there, then what's the point? That would feel wrong if they weren't there. Unless we want to drop some lore that there is something special about this cave. That makes the crystals glow. But it's also fitting in Yoshi's Island. Let's see what happens. If you look at Yoshi's Island grotto levels. The cave of Harry Hedgehog. It's also got this glow in the crystals. Here too. But not around the mirror glass. No? I think we do. What we could actually do is to make it so that the only light you see in this cave is from the entrance and the exit. And the window. Yeah, okay, same idea. The only light sources are the entrance, the exit and the mirror. And the window grotto. So that's what we'll do. So it's supposed to be a narrow path but bottomless on both sides or do you want to make it safer? I kind of don't like that you can die in the overworld. So on one end I would like it to be safer. On the other, it kind of needs to be dark for this to work at all. Okay. Hmm. I still want there to be a secret start here. Maybe there's something you have to do in the dark secret path you can't find without the hints. Maybe this shouldn't be a dark pit but rather just a stop. Actually that doesn't work. There's a reason why we can't have stagnant green water at the bottom of this cave and some cliffs to climb up at the entrance. No, that's a very good idea. I like that. Let me just add that real quick. Okay.  And then maybe the secret start can be if you dive down or something. No maze split off to the side? No. Hello and die ads. Once you press a crystal a bar can pick up and an axe is a light source that reveals a path in the dark light. They are appearing platforms in Yon's Castle. Oh, that's a cool idea. Should the entire path be like that? And then maybe it splits off somewhere. Let me get a quick vibe check here. I'm going to go through the water to find the hidden entrance. Something like that. Hello tea time. What if there was a star here? It would cause a big glow and it would be pretty easy to find, right? So we have that option available to us. Nope, it's just part of the overworld. So over there is going to be the window to Rainbow Grotto. And then here could be a little glowing crystal that you can pick up. Yeah, exactly. So you'd have the crystal and you'd walk along here. Oh my god, that's a long walk for a crystal. I think there would have to be a bunch of platforms in between that you can jump on and then some jumps you have to make without the crystal. Yeah, yeah, okay. Listen to this. What if the crystal is right at the beginning and you use it to reveal a glowing path? Maybe the crystal is here and you see a little bit of a path here. You walk along the path with the crystal. And then here there's going to be a jump that you can't make with the crystal in hand. So you jump over and pick up the next crystal. And then again you walk, you walk, you walk. And then right here there is a jump you can make without the crystal, but it's difficult. So now what you're going to most likely do is drop the crystal and jump over here. And then if you still have the crystal here, there's a last path that you can use to get to the star. Right, it would be required for navigation, but you would drop it a couple times and then do normal jumps and platforming, just so it's not all walking forward. Oh, I see. So you think it should just be dark, but still visible. Well, you're only going to go through the cave one time, realistically. There's also the idea that you could pick up the crystal here and then walk all the way around the cave. Jump and get to this side. But that's obviously terrible. Well, you would see the star pretty obviously, like, floating over there, making a light. Well, we could make it so that the crystal isn't required, but makes it slightly more comfortable, so most people will do it. Let me think what the path would look like. Would it just be like a floating rock path, maybe? Would it be a more surreal path that appears, like in the ice castle? Would it be like a light path? Would it be like in Mario Galaxy, where it's just fucking carpet? What about the idea that you have to drop the crystal twice and do some platforming in between, though? And that there's two different crystals to pick up? I think that has the advantage that you would see the crystal over here right away from when you're at the entrance, and you would see that the crystal is what makes the path appear. Right, but if it's fun to platform past this, then I think it's fine by me. Also, again, this is a path you will likely just walk once. Maybe twice if you're trying to get the star and haven't gotten it the first time. No, the water is just water. Falling in the water sucks. That's an issue. Like, it sucks more than it should suck. There were a couple of things between the points. You can in Minecraft 2, but you need to go for a pattern with the crystal to reach the star. Oh, I like that. Let's think about how that would work. Mmm... I think, though, regardless of what we do, this is gonna go. That seems entirely confirmed to me. Okay. I think a zipline from one side to the other, and then a star somewhere above the zipline so you can't just cheese it. Well, the zipline doesn't quite work because it's going up, unless we made the player climb up here somehow, which I guess we could do.  Polygon of the old world? Right now, it's just 10,000, roughly. But this is just a draft. The final old world is probably gonna have almost 100,000 polygons. Maybe not that much, maybe like 50,000. Yeah. Alright, fuck it, zipline. Zipline it is. The idea that slow is normal, and then you can be fast if you want to get... that fast is normal and you can be slow if you want to get the star, I think it's very promising. That makes modelling the entrance a little bit awkward, but I think we can deal with it. Oh, you know what I never did? I never made sure that these transitions work fine. We gotta do that right now. Otherwise, we are in big trouble. Okay. Okay. Like, this does not work. Sorry, I'm kind of brainwashed. I love Tralalero Tralala. He is so funny. Yes, very similar to that toilet duck. Well, Koopa Karnival uses something even different, but yes, kind of. I don't know. I don't know.        Left was flowing really fast, so if you fall in, it pushes you to the start really fast. That sounds like a good idea. Brrbrr Patapim. You are brrbrr Patapim fanboy? Get out of here. So, I'm guessing you have the same Instagram, or Twitter, or TikTok algorithm as me. TikTok. TikTok, I see. See, I'm only on Instagram when I'm pooping, and I know about Trollolero Trollola. Dude, I had the best possible introduction to these memes that you can imagine. See, what happened to me is, the first thing I see is a reel of Neil deGrasse Tyson talking about whether Bombardier or Crocodilo or Trollolero Trollola is better. And I had no idea who these guys were. And I'm just, you know, watching it while shitting. And he's talking about how Trollolero can push off meteors with his boots, but also swim really fast in the ocean. And I'm like, what the fuck is Trollolero? And then the next wheel I see it's like statistics about shark attacks and it showed one shark attack like in a country that had no source of water anywhere and then zoomed into that and then it showed me tra-la-la-ro-tra-la-la and it's like holy shit this is the best reveal of the century what the fuck is the context of this okay wait this is tra-la-la-ro-tra-la-la it's a fucking shark with boots they say AI art has no soul they have not seen tra-la-la-ro-tra-la-la he brings me happiness all right how can you hate AI art when tra-la-la-ro-tra-la-la brings me so much happiness okay they say is to be logging what these the pedo pin is racist he canceled but ballerina cappuccino is a banger and I thought it was just improvising random bullshit it's funny that everyone has such a different angle to that hello QPacks are you saying it's wrong to only be on Instagram when you're pooping or are you saying that you are there even when you're not pooping because I feel like you shouldn't go on Instagram when you're not pooping I feel like that's like absolute proof that your brain is gone should doing with that entrance I'm making it work with the new open world system because it wasn't before Instagram right now you aren't switched right now I'd love to know what's the process for actually getting the monitor my 64 I pressed the export button and fast 64 there is quite a bit of history to this to actually like explain why that's a possibility suddenly add meme I've liked so far is the one of the dr. Mario face through that's good too dude da I hate has gotten so bad that people are accusing me of using an AI voice in my videos because I sound weird bro I'm sorry but I'm German I'm not going to sound normal I can't help it it anyways why would you choose one with a German accent to make myself more unique we all know you're secretly an Indian pretending to be German like I'm pretty sure I've gotten a comment like that before I've gotten a lot of like really anti Indian racist comments on my videos it's kind of weird I don't know where they're coming from or why I'm getting them I don't think I sound very Indian I don't know I've been told my German sounds very unnatural to so maybe they would then think that I am using an AI because my German sounds unnatural why is the song going whoop whoop whoop maybe it's because you are good at computer instead like an Indian thing isn't usually the accusation that Indian programmers are like cheap and terrible but also the accusation is that when you want to learn programming you just learn it from like an Indian man on YouTube not really understood yet how that part this is kind of nasty I think we just have to deal with that this is the Dr. good I'm actually afraid to say that I like the I mean because I'm a youtuber and if I make any statements that crazy people disagree with and crazy people really love to hate AI then I'm like in trouble it's best to enjoy this quietly true we've late Mario one I have not what why be afraid I think I very agree the genitive AI is soulless there is still a human soul that made that there is a human that decided to make that Mario Luigi AI video they thought of the storyline they put it together it's their soul in that video even if they have not actually mastered any craft the soul is in the story not the visuals exactly I'd say Janice honest they don't mean anything make that as Jan I and at any point of solace maybe the smart people don't mean that but I have definitely seen people say it like that I think sometimes Janae I like the fact that it's Janae I even like enhances the enjoyment for example for me on only up 64 the whole game is supposed to be like soulless low effort streamer bait rage bait game and I could have used any OST I wanted but I went out of my way to pick AI generated music for it because it fits the vibe it's like perfect for that it's like this isn't human made this is this is made by an entity this is made by someone who wants to min max money it's part of the art piece you know that that it is using Janae I like it makes it more soulless and it's supposed to be soulless anyway I think the cape is good now and we can make the thing yes super simulator I don't know what that is but yeah I can definitely see it being very valuable for satire I've already seen the future for AI and keep in mind my my politics and my opinions are 100% just schizophrenia based but the future I see is people say you can't monetize AI unless you've trained it yourself and then really big companies are going to train AI and they're gonna make so much garbage and people are going to eat it up and no one else can make the same amount of garbage because they don't have the resources to train an AI this is the future we're and you know what the people that are children now they're five or six they're gonna grow up on AI movies by the time they're old enough to understand what it is they are what they won't care anymore I've seen the AI family guy and stuff like that I have not actually yes I have totally fine with big cars being the only one of the asses that sounds so dystopian though right the way it's served on everyone's throats well yeah it's definitely very overused and annoying right now I have an eight-month-old daughter actually she's almost nine months old now and I definitely feel like I have to be careful with what she's gonna watch on TV so she doesn't get brain rotted it's too bad that nowadays every issue is turned into cultural bullshit so you can't actually have like a proper discussion about anything and because everything's turned into cultural bullshit it's like hard to take anything serious that's being alarmed about oh yeah definitely not what I think my kid to watch Cocoa Melon I don't know what hero access I don't know what hero access is a political because making anything into an ass versus stem issue is beneficial for both big American parties and so deep just keep doing that I guess I don't know and somehow everyone else just has America's politics for some reason what the fuck is that I'm talking about what where'd that come from you see the bad news they're cancelling the Donkey game from being woke I've seen it on Twitter dude I don't think it's real I think it's rage bait I'm calling cap no one believes that it's rage bait okay some point of everything you say it's rage bait maybe it's not pretending anymore okay but I thought if you're rage baiting for like the clicks like you're being a complete idiot on purpose to get the clicks is that not reasonable and then you just rage bait forever I guess it's a lot easier to rage bait if you generally are like a complete moron so maybe some of them are actually like that and I don't know man you amaritchee five spins benning to be a Moran against you at some point Well, I mean, imagine if they make like a ton of money out of all that That would be smart, right? But it is true that if you repeat a lie often enough, you start believing it That is a very real psychological phenomenon Who's range are you mating and can I get someone killed? Well, well usually you're rage baiting the people that disagree with the thing you're doing. Yeah, it's just rage bait is so profitable that I'm not really willing to believe that most things people say online are meant to be taken serious anymore. I don't have that suspension of disbelief anymore, you know? I'm so in love with Mario, am I right? True, I love Mario. But hey, sometimes in this chat we have real discussions that are not bing bing wahoo and I think that's okay. Well of course rage baiting is not morally defensible, I don't think anyone was arguing for that. I'm saying though, you should probably just ignore it. Hello YYotaPet, welcome to the stream. Okay, that seems like a good send off point for our thing. I think we've gotten there. Straight up joking it to AI chatbots right now. I don't want to offend anyone man, but if you are stroking it to AI chatbots, something went really wrong in your life and I think you know. I'm just scared that like one person in my chat right now is actually doing that and they're like, oh fuck man, my favorite streamer is against me. So true Kaze, oh no. Kaze is rage baiting. Now if I want to rage bait, I have something way better. Actually no, I don't want to say who said this, but the best rage bait I have ever experienced like in real life was someone saying Ocarina of Time actually is not good. Dude, that gets people going. You have no idea. Is it really rage baiting if it's true? Oh Biobank, you can't say that. Shit, I didn't think we had that many Ocarina of Time haters in chat right now. I just must admit, as fuck me, I wasn't directly involved in it. Shorts didn't get far in the 90s before quitting. Whoa, that is good rage bait. It's too bad you're not being serious right now. Tears are getting on pieces of the fence, so I love it. What, Tears of the Kingdom? Okay, that's actually a bad take. Okay, my rage bait is Breath of the Wild is better than Tears of the Kingdom. And it's a genuine opinion I have. What do you think about the Switch 2? Oh yeah, we didn't talk about the Switch 2 yet. The software they showed for the Switch 2 looks cool. The fact that the controller can be used as a mouse is pretty cool. But really, there was no reason for a new hardware. You could have just released the software on the Switch 1. Waste of money, to be honest, for me. Okay, Portal 1 is way better than Portal 2. I think people that say Tears of the Kingdom is better or Portal 2 is better fall into the critics' dilemma. What do I mean by this? The critics' dilemma is when you consume a type of media and because you build experience with the type of media, you start making guidelines for what you think should make a thing good. So, for example, you might play games and then you might make the connection, hey, more game is more better or more content is more better. And as a result, because you make these principles that are not necessarily true, you end up having to say that you prefer games that, if you actually measured your enjoyment, didn't enjoy as much, simply because your principles are off of what reality really is. This is the critics' dilemma and I invented it. Building machines in Tears of the Kingdom is the best part. Unfortunately, the game does not encourage you to do that at all. It costs a lot of resources and has very little use and they despawn pretty quickly. I think if people played Portal 2 first, they would still prefer Portal 1. Depends on how much time passed between the two games. If they played Portal 2 first and then a year later Portal 1, I think they would prefer Portal 1. If you had them play them back to back, I think they would prefer Portal 2. They don't open doors, they buy you stuff. They are money. How does it encourage you to do that in depth? There's still no point in building the machines. There's like one machine you should ever build and that's the thing that flies and gets you everywhere and is very cheap. And then it becomes trivial. Then it becomes like playing Mario 64 with press Alt or Levitate type fun. Where it's not actually fun at all. The same thing I would prefer to type the game with no story, one type of puzzle and two types of environments across the whole game. It has a story. The story is what kind of glues Portal 1 together. Like yeah, on paper it's just a bunch of test chambers that would be very mentally exhausting to get through. But they put easier puzzles in with the difficult ones in a way that it doesn't actually get exhausting. How is Breath of the Wild slop? What did I miss? I'm sorry if there's an evil robot and you missed this game, definitely just stop it. Well, at first the robot's friendly. I think that changes a few things. But you are right that it's not a very in-depth story. Breath of the Wild is one good thing. The best thing about Breath of the Wild is that every shrine you do, you get a new insight on how your kit works. It slowly expands your horizon as you play the game. Tears of the Kingdom does not have that. The Tears of the Kingdom kit is much more powerful. But because each individual tool is so much more powerful, the potential for inculbations of how you use that is vastly reduced. Because there's a few combinations that are so powerful that they overcome any obstacle. I'm sorry if there's an evil robot and you missed this game, definitely just stop it. A new meta deck in Pokemon TCGP? Oh, I haven't played the Pokemon TCG. I'm not familiar with anything meta about the TCG past what the Gameboy game had. Would you deck with one Pokemon in 18 different trainers? What the fuck? That does sound kind of fun. That's a fun side mod. I like that. It's so good you basically can't lose. Wait, what? But one of the two people has to lose. Oh, as in, it's not a side mod, it's like, that's what you deck is. You build a deck with that. Okay, that's crazy. That sounds like some Yu-Gi-Oh type bullshit. I knew card draw in the Pokemon TCG was way too strong. So is it just you have so many trainer cards and you can do so many things in one turn that you have all the options available to you? Yeah, Pokemon TCG is gonna fall the same way the Yu-Gi-Oh TCG fell. It's fun now, but wait until you have to read 15 paragraphs to do one thing. Since you always draw a Pokemon to your first turn, you can put your most powerful Pokemon there. Wait, what? That's not how it works in the Gameboy game. In the Gameboy game, you shuffle your deck and if you don't draw a Pokemon, you shuffle it again and draw one less until you draw a Pokemon. So you would actually most of the time just start with one Pokemon in hand and nothing else. I will actually just put this here. Make sure not to get cancelled. I will try. So far I've made it almost to 300k without getting cancelled. It's amazing. Cancel culture is weird. This rapper diddled little children. Someone has to cancel them. And it's like, no, you don't need to cancel them. You need to arrest them. Why are you talking about cancelling, bro? This is a real issue. Don't date kids, don't be a Nazi. Yeah, those are some good print spots to live by. No, not six months of cancellation. That's what ProGyrat got, isn't it? Six months of, actually no, he had like a full year of cancellation. That sucks. But it was 2017. On 2017, you could literally call someone the hard R as an insult and not get cancelled, which is what PewDiePie did. 2024 is different. 2025, actually. It is still insane to me that PewDiePie did that and he's still like the second most, third most subscribed channel on YouTube. He got cancelled. Not really. We're circling back. He's saying the hard R is making a return. Actually, yes, I've been on Instagram. It definitely made a return on Instagram. Coming from i will let it pass because it's you saying that and i know you're jewish but if anyone else said that i would be like bro what you probably shouldn't say that even as a what's eugenics that's what the nazis tried well i shouldn't be looking for a text just temporary piece of shit thing so i see better no but if you've ever been on instagram you will know what i'm talking about it is pretty bad so the guy invented callux cereals to stop children from joking and what  this needs the same treatment that i did to the sliding um hanging from everything is the same but as grinding used so that you needed to add alteration when children from beating and crazy styles invented the blandest breakfast possible ah but isn't how callux nowadays is full of sugar they straight from their mission they had a vision and then they decided to just give up halfway through that sucks bro children are gonna go back to just stroking it crazy style because of him so true you could absolutely go to my store and buy a rambus mug cool cool cool definitely a bug i would like to fix real quick  i see that sucks let's move it 6500 coordinates everything in here oops so that should fix it you want case memes to put on the merch yeah i need to make more memes i think that's a terrible idea biobank you were just just 10 minutes ago you were giving me a tutorial on how to not get cancelled and now you're saying this we lost the plot what the what the what the fuck oh cool so you need to get people to cancel so you get more popular well if i ever get cancelled and i want to be popular again i have to become like a right-wing grifter i think i think that'd be the way to go so this is a threat if you cancel me i'm gonna grift the fuck out of everyone i'm gonna start being like the craziest guy ever you remember the fucking pronouns guy i'm gonna be 15 times as bad so i'll see how i'm doing pretty well making some good progress so uncle yoshi deleted oh it took me a second yes you still work for my game dude so you need to sell supplements yeah wow oh no i didn't think about that part you're not gonna mention gyno i think it's really nice guy i know i'm joking don't worry i don't think i'm gonna get cancelled i don't know what for unless it's for like some stupid early stuff i made or like comments i left on super mario world central because i was wilding into super mario world central times i was being a public nuisance on that website but they deserved it to be fair super mario world center was so weird they gave us like a mario 64 modding forum and then they didn't make any of us mario 64 modders mods and then they complained that we made our forum so dirty and no one was cleaning it dude that feels like being gaslit almost just crazy thing to pull off cover all grounds by posting two videos the vogue left tried to cancel me for this game and the alt right hates this game because they hate real art honestly yeah if i ever get cancelled i can go full shit posting full like stop making any sense at all  and posters in your world for this game also at playable luigi there are plenty of posters we're hiding in the overworld i'm doing it right now actually i'm working on one of them i said it before but the real strategy to get like infinite fame is to buy chatbot farms we're gonna get chatbot farms and we are going to get a bunch of like super right-wing chatbots that talk about how the purple yoshi in this game is too woke and how you need to cancel this game and then we're also gonna get chatbots arguing with them and we're gonna make each side of the chatbots say something really stupid and ragebaity and then we're gonna retweet this with the other side of the chatbots and like dunk on them and that way we're gonna start discourse about this game until we get famous and real people join in at which point we can retire the chatbot farms and by that time there's gonna be so much real discourse no one's ever gonna know that all it was is just a bunch of chatbots luigi might be playable i don't know yet why don't you actually do that who says i'm not gonna do that dude if that actually works that would be crazy maybe we should try it and then i can make a youtube video about having done that i love mario thank you for the i love mario thank you for the 11 months zeta zeta oh no problem i don't mind you aren't pressing me make up a fake andy vocal dude almost all i'm convinced they're all fake i don't think they're real it's rage bait they're not real bowser is kind of a simp so he's always gonna be exactly at the same place on the political spectrum as he believes peaches he's just copy pasting those because he wants to get in those dms so bowser's political orientation is incel but like not one of the bad ones one of the good ones um bowser would make you a sandwich he would be the one in the kitchen so actually what am i saying incel but one of the good ones instead of one of the bad ones that's just male feminist right so see guys sometimes it's not so bad that we're all talking about politics sometimes we get good shitposts out of it um this doesn't really look great but i'm sure we can salvage it somehow um the oeuvre of christopher nolan i don't know what that is um one two three oh wait that's six already oh hello that's 15 total one two three four five six nice so so so so i don't know bullet  yeah i should google it it's probably a porn thing and i don't want to google it okay now the cave looks a lot cooler so the head does have gravity well the texture at the front is currently bugged but don't worry about it it's very easy to fix i fell in the water because there's a bug with the thing here uh you can only really fall in the water if you let go of a oh so you're not really supposed to fall in the water it's just there as a safety mechanism okay fine i'll take your support let's say let's go on google images i don't i mean i guess it's porn inspired uh maybe it's not fully there but it's definitely crossing into that territory it's definitely crossing into guna territory no that's that's not what i'm saying look at the face she's making oh i don't look at any but that is definitely some guna stuff ruining the search all right anyway i think we're done for today we got 16 stars planned we want five more stars in the overworld and we found five new stars to put in the overworld just by going through the first five courses which if we continue this means we're probably going to go above 21 stars and then maybe we have to put like 185 stars in this game maybe we put 200 stars in the game i don't know i'm fine with all of it i do want the overworld to feel as alive as possible so maybe we just say fuck it and go to 200 we'll see doesn't really make a big difference in the because odyssey has moons that's that's we can do that we can actually genuinely just say that anyway i will see you guys next stream bye
