This particular MEDINA team gave us a lot of information, as well as updates to our   All right, if anyone sees this, let me know, and then I know that everyone sees this. I'm going to be UV mapping part of this level today. The question is, what do I want this to look like? Probably like this stuff here. I only see a pawn folder on screen. What? I don't have one. Welcome to the stream, Mr. Comet. It's a rare case bonus stream today. Hello, Silva. Streaming on Labor Day. Who's in labor today? What is Labor Day? Is that one of those fancy American holidays? Hello, LFE. Did I pick out a holiday to bonus stream? Isn't that perfect timing? Hello, B-Turk, yep, it's a case stream today. I just kind of felt like streaming. On a Monday? Yeah. Localized entirely within the Monday? Correct. May I see it? No. Hello, Cream Dima. Everyone's telling me about Labor Day today. I have no idea that what's going on. UwU, Konichiwa, Keis-chan, Ovu. All right. Maybe I shouldn't have streamed on Labor Day. Apparently all the weirdos get out on that day. Hello, Lila. Lila, remember when you were complaining that I always say I'm going to do a bonus stream and then I don't? Where is your God now? You can say, no, Lila, I know you don't have a job. You didn't even mention a bonus stream this time. Yeah, I just kind of felt like doing a bonus stream. Why is it Labor Day for everyone? How the fuck are you all pregnant? Exactly. Hello, I made a decision to watch the stream. I haven't seen much of the level, but all detectors look great. Okay, that's a very surprising thing to hear because all the textures right now look like dog shit because this is an early work in progress. I'm glad you like it anyway, though. You have a very wide palette. Are arcs more expensive to compute than hexagons? Yes. It's in the name. I want the music on a stream. Yeah, we got to pick music. Any wishes? Oh, yeah, I want to show you guys this. I finished this off stream yesterday and today, but we got FBDX3 working correctly now. And let me just show you the performance now. No, FBDX3, which is the new microcode that Sauron made. And yes, Leela, I now use material bleeding. I'm not sure if you can see it, but it's basically like 50 FPS now. And I haven't even limited the drawing distance again. So what this is still rendering is the grasshoppers. Do you see the grasshoppers? Because I don't, but they're rendering. If we disable those and maybe we disable some of the goombas here that are like one pixel back. Oh, I saw a grasshopper. I'm gonna bring it down to 30. No, all my FPS. I worked so hard. But yeah, I'm pretty sure we can get this to stable 60 now, except for if you look at the most expensive selling, of course. But you see that bunny over there all the way in the background that is being rendered all the way over there. Or the bird here. Do you see the bird on the line? You don't. But if I get really close. There, you can see the bird now. I'm just having a fun chance. Get the drawing distance depending on the render area size. Oh. Hello, Eli Voltec. Thank you. Get about 60 FPS. Could you at least measure it? Yeah, I can measure the RDP time and then like estimate what the FPS would be. Anyway, do we have any OST wishes for today? Oh, that's ugly. Why is it like this? If you per area draw distance again, you could make that even better. I have per area drawing distance later. You said something about render area. Marker the SOST? All right, let's do it. You know, the crunchy 30 by 30 we used for Ness and shit. I rendered a new one. Blender looks so much better. Now the tree level is going to look a lot better just because of this. Oh, that's awesome. There we go. Does the most expensive view increase at the same rate? At the same rate as what? See infinite chance. Hello, Struggle. It is not. We're working on it, all right? Struggle, you've worked on games before. You know it's not that easy. You out of all people. Come on. You know what I'm going through. Look at him. Oh my God, that is nice. That is really nice. Sad face unfair. I'm sad facing over it too. So. No work on that long of a game. Yeah. Are you running Ubuntu on your Windows install? What does it do? It compiles the game for me. This is fucking hideous, oh my God. I don't understand what you mean. Kay sent me the ROM. I need to take a screenshot. Of course one. All right. Um, I can't. File size too big. Hello, Vakha Innovator. Kay's mouse got burned down by me setting it on fire on purpose. And this is the only thing I enjoy ever since. Other than setting other people's on fire. Thank you. No problem, dude. Do you think Kay's level one on Twitter still hates you? Probably. One second. I gotta change my chat. Let me just. Dude, it's only showing like 10 messages at a time. What the fuck? Why is this so small? Oh, wow. Alexerclump? Yep, surprise stream. One side is seamless, the other is not. Oh. This sucks. Depends on having water in the next demo. I really want to test the new swimming. The next demo will just be corresponding. Yeah. Somebody excited with the Banjo-Kazooie. It's pretty cool that it came together now. Yeah. I mean, of course, I am not going to use it myself because I don't really care that much about Banjo-Kazooie. But I'm very glad that exists. Lila, fix it. Oh my god, Lila, get on it. Lila, why are the dishes not done yet? Oh. All right, fellas, if I miss a message in chat today, then I blame Restream Chat because it's just so small. And I am in compact mode and just not very compact. I don't understand. The market is tracking along. Super excited for that. Yeah, that would be cool. Yeah, Lila, why is Restream Chat like this? Can you fix it? Banjo-Kazooie does make it the worst water controls ever and then putting in every level. Did they? They're turning it on and off again. I have not. Hello, Indigo.  New demo of what? Dude, I have a stacked video schedule. I'm planning to make a video about all the optimizations in Mario 64 and in Mario 64 Run worse next. And then after that, I want to make a video about the new demo for Chris 1. And then I want to make a video about the new demo for Banjo-Kazooie. And then after that, maybe I want to make a video about how we were wrong about memory traffic being so important. And instead it's RSP because now with X3, we found out that RSP is actually the limiting factor. Now, if you actually optimize your game well. And then. I'm thinking maybe I should make a video about all the beta assets that were left in Mario 64. Case, please start verifying misinformation. How is that misinformation, Lila? There aren't any N64 review asking about. OK, but how is that misinformation? Basically, only a new thing. It will be a thing for anyone who actually optimizes their memory traffic decently. I wasn't the only one that had X3 be slower at first. They said that Rionna had the same issue. I don't think it is just a me thing. No one else has 90% CPU idle time. Well, then optimize your CPU. Here, take a look at the tree shadow texture from the base game. Open and look at it. It makes me cry. Uh, shit, I don't see it in here. Level only this one. That's a goofy texture, yeah. I said it and Rionna was having slow RSP because you run X3. And X3 hits him poorly. Yeah. Exactly. Which means, in that case, the RSP is the bottleneck. Hello, Hans Meyer. Since Rionna has holes in it and they straight up scaled it and painted as a placeholder. Yeah, I can believe that they used the placeholder texture in Final. I generally do believe that. No, I think it was an X2 as well. I mean, okay, think about this. X3 now runs the RSP faster than X2. And because the RSP runs faster, we have better performance. If you look at my performance counter on the N64, you can see that I'm still RSP bottlenecked. Even though I have a faster microcode now than X2 has. So it absolutely is the RSP being the bottleneck. And the branch you run? Yes, I run the RSP optimized branch. And the RSP optimized branch is still RSP bottlenecked.  it absolutely is the RSP at this point. Wouldn't the frame measure be a bottleneck itself and therefore less accurate? The frame measure does reduce the performance, yes. You're absolutely right about that. Maybe the world is just not ready to move on from blaming the RDP on the N64 and Filrate. But one day they will learn. And then they will optimize their RSP. And they will realize that if you already have your memory optimized, you can move on to optimizing the RSP. Because otherwise, more memory optimization doesn't necessarily yield the results you want. At this point, I think that optimizing memory helps the RSP run well. And that's why optimizing memory still improves stuff. It's kind of nice looking. Leila, did you watch the stream? Did you see how that reset to CI4? Fix it. So, sorry, I'm in my job right now. Oh, no. Okay, we have an issue in this level. And that is we are running out of memory for collision triangles. Yep, that sucks. It's only temporary because as soon as we make a collision map, that issue will go away. But for now, we're just gonna have to make stuff untouchable. So, I don't know if there will be another demo for the full game. I'm planning a demo of just Course 1, only the first level. So everyone can play with the new camera and the new Mario controls. By the way, I have one bug right now, which I don't know why it's happening, but it's this here. When I get close to an additional light source, the ambient light just disappears. I couldn't figure it out at all. It doesn't seem to be an emulator bug either. Well, I mean, it works on X3, but the X2 version doesn't work. The pipes don't have textures, they have textures, it's just that when you load them the first time, there's no lights active. Oh, this looks kind of sick. X3 did the ambient light, yes, but on emulator I load X2. The ambient works on X3, it's just that on emulator I load X2 and X2 ambient light works, except if I apply the lighting in Mario's GeoLayout. So these are going to be used as room doors, so that when I'm here I render both rooms and when I'm here I just don't render the other room. Hello Smigmas, hello Smigma. Um, hmm, what do we texture next? I feel like this one might need a different texture for the walls. Everything having the same textures like the outside walls is kind of not nice. I didn't remove save state use, you can still save state, you will just be yelled at. Yeah, this level has a lot of potential, I think. It's just, I find it really hard to actually come up with stuff. I also don't like this texture that I'm standing on here. The ice carpet is ugly, I like the ice carpet. But we can make it a real carpet or something. Yoshiwrap is still in the game, yes. Something smooth shaded. Either way, I think I have to make up something for this. This looks terrible right now. I don't like that the inner walls are the same textures like the outer walls. On the corners near that first room. You mean this one? Yes, that is very stretched. But we don't fix that for now. Because that's all going to be automated later. Okay, Leela, I hate Flat Shaded End Map, what? Okay, wait, you hate all of them? Because what about like the spikes here? I think the spikes look sick. Surely you can't hate those. Are we still planning on the outside area now? We are planning on the outside area and Zeyna is making it right now. Or she's making assets for it. Two stars are going to be related to the outside area. The first one is we're just going to have 8 Red Coins in the outside area. So basically the outside area is small. Small enough to be a separate 8 Red Coins area. And then there's going to be a hidden entrance for the 8-Bit from the outside area. It's a bad example case. Okay, sure. This feels like too much blue. Hmm. See, okay, when I'm doing visuals, I don't really think about it in terms of like pleasure to look at. That's like secondary to me. For me, I think about it in first line about like emotions I want to invoke in the player. And I want this to feel cold and mysterious. So blue is good.    Sorry, I'm late, but the spikes are kind of ugly. What? I do drop something. Oh, he's mad about the spikes. I will eat you alive. Try adding teals. Yeah, I mean, yeah. What is teal? Can you answer this question with six numbers? Hmm. Do you think chess is too easy? Chess is as difficult as your opponent is good. Is he trying to sound smart again? How? So now the rest of the osu! will be uploaded to YouTube. I've been waiting for the rainbow grunt and infant gable for months. I don't have an upload schedule for that. I just kind of do it when I'm out of content. Okay, just making sure I'm turning into an Elon type. Um, one second. Okay, so I'm going to upload this to YouTube.      What would an Elon type say about that? He makes something. He's comparing me to Elon Musk? That fraud? I'm so much smarter than Elon Musk and I invented way better electric cars. Teal is like 75C0FF. Oh, wait, isn't? I'm pretty sure this is teal then. Well, actually, no, not that one. That's too green. Something like this, maybe. That's kind of teal. Hmm. Why isn't it in game? Because, um, I don't know. So prefer assembly program to highline language? Like, see, if so, why? It depends on what I'm doing. The thing about assembly is, uh, it's really easy to use. Like you don't have to learn how to use a compiler and stuff like that. But also it's really a lot of work to use. Do you know I felt anything with that sign and said happy hole instead of gay hole? I can only imagine the horrors that went through your mind, Lila. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. It's very low R plus identical, darker and GB values like 0, 3, F, 7, F, 7, 1. That dark? Yeah, I don't know about that one. Yeah, probably make it a bit more distinguished. C8, A2, C8. That's just fucking pink. Very desaturated pink. I know you want me to say that that's lilac, but it's not. Fuck you. You're desaturated pink. This is the Christmas level? Nope. That's disgusting looking, honestly. Maybe I have something in unidentified worlds. Is this a fridge level? Yeah, it's a fridge type level. What if there was permanent damage over time you took in this level? Like the fridge level in 3D land as 64 land. Dude, actually, a fridge level was such a banger idea. I have to say, dude. It would be super fun, I think. Yeah, there's nothing more fun than having anxiety. Never a boring day. You have a vertical fridge now with the cold mist room? How do? But that's on purpose. One section like that isn't gonna hurt. It's just if you have the entire level like that, I think that's a bit much. Imagine what you could do nowadays with a house level. True, dude. Nathaniel Bandy would love that. Why don't we design our game specifically just for Nathaniel Bandy? I'm gonna write him on Discord right now and ask him if he wants this to be a fridge level. What's with the toxic cold air? Wouldn't water make more sense? Well, water would be frozen. So in that sense, it wouldn't make any sense. You can do a toilet level. Damn, I missed out. I haven't done a toilet level yet. Ain't he Nathaniel B? Yep, that's Nathaniel B. That's Nathaniel B for you. He loves those house levels. What the fuck do I even want from this? Like this? Is this what I want? Really? Surely that cannot be what I want. This is so terrible. So we don't have to mandate a toilet like that? Not yet, but surely it will come around. If it happens, it happens. That looks gross. It does look gross. I think it looks good. I think you should jump off that building. Okay, so I think that's a really smart idea. I think you should put it all on red. This is not financial advice, by the way. Do you use Discord at your IRL job? I don't have an IRL job. All my jobs are online. But yes, I do use my Discord at my online job. There's also this, which is equally disgusting, I think. Hey look, it's Teal. Hello, floppy fish. I mean, it is Teal, but there's more turquoise. Turquoise is more blue than green. That was more green than blue. Hello, teatime. Yes, bonus stream. Well, the wording is green slash white. I do have a lot of things that bleed into white. The art direction in this level right now is a little boring, I will agree. But I don't think it's bad. It's just, it's missing the secret sauce. Nope, there will not be a Gameboy screen. Actually, maybe I should have a Gameboy screen filter. Oh, it could look cool. Purple might just be the secret sauce. I don't know. Honestly, something like this wouldn't be so bad. Like if the whole thing looked like this, I think I wouldn't hate it. It would just kind of look like, like a chafey mountain. How is that? Cocoa Mountain? No, not Cocoa Mountain. I want like an ice mountain that looks like someone took a bite of it. You know what I mean? Like this, but not disgusting and awful. Oh my God. Have you ever looked at this? What the hell? Yeah, like this type of wall. That's what I want. Purple is the blue cheese sauce. Bad. Someone take a bite out of ice. Yeah. Okay, so it seems good. But the red or something is even better. Oh. I've actually only recently 100% of Mario Kart 64. They still managed to make DDD like with these graphics. I made a video about removing optimizations from Mario 64 to make Mario 64 run better. And I got DDD to run at 30 FPS on that video. By removing optimizations. Hello, spaghetto. 3DS also fixed DayaDayaDogs. I think they just ran on more powerful hardware. Do you have a job? Yeah, I have a few jobs. You've heard about me from Bethaniel. Big fame here. So without hating myself. Obviously, we need to fix the UV mapping. Kind of like that. And even the people you guys got a few jobs to survive. I mean, what am I else? Am I supposed to live off? You know, just like I'm so good. Give me your money. I mean, I wish I could, but I think that's not how the world works. So although I do wish I could just live off of just being an internet personality. I'm actually going to be trying to make a lot more money soon, which means like I make a lot more videos because now that I have a child, I need to make more money. So that means a lot more YouTube content. But it also means I might have to sell out a little bit, unfortunately. Let's see how much I have to sell out. She might not just to be an internet personality. Okay. This is what I was thinking. We made an old account, a Mario 64 hacker. We release a bunch of games under that name, but we make it like obnoxious. Some stuff that's like super obnoxious and will get famous. We make like the most clickbait videos ever. And then on this old account, we pretend to be a pedophile. And then on the main account, we expose the old account for being a pedophile. And we make it to the YouTube trends and get 2 million views. I don't need energy. Dude, if you ever look at YouTube, all of YouTube right now is just this person's a pedophile, this person's a groomer. That is what's going well on YouTube. You just have to invent a pedophile to expose him. And then you get the views. Alternatively, we could just expose a real pedophile in the community. 4D chess, yeah, see, okay Leela remember when you said chess is too easy? This is the type of chess I'm playing, 4D fucking chess. I sacrifice myself, you're exposing a pedophile account for also being a pedophile, wait what? I would have to expose him on my real accounts to get the views you know, I can't expose myself, unless I make an old account for that and I start beef with myself, pretend to be a kid and introduce an existing youtuber it will take less time, honestly, true, oh, that's just chess with an extra dimension, it will work, not enough people have read this, besides everyone thinks it's a joke, they will never know it's real, also if you say that I'm just pretending and you're clearly siding with the pedophile which makes you a terrible person, so are you sure you wanna be on the wrong side of history? You can also adopt the swanky box searching and make a video for every misaligned UV map and leftover object in Mario games, that's true, and then make an apology video on your alt, now I would have to make a doubling down video, and then I can make a second video doubling down on my main channel, like 5 different it's over videos, you guys know exactly what I'm talking about, I don't know if this is able to handle for the snowy grounds but what do I do if you made it so that the ground pound could show off, it does work like that, it works exactly like you're asking for it to work, 8 minute video about misplaced coin, I'm pretty sure PineappleCoke has made that already, about the impossible coin, I think dude it's a big idiot, the Popeye for Nintendo Switch community loved him until he was exposed as a pdf file, yep, PineappleCoke's video address makes a difference, yeah I like PineappleCoke's videos, I think he dwells on points for a little bit too long, but he's very thorough and he's putting a lot of effort into making sure everyone can understand it, so I do like those, another case to point that his idea, I think my idea is great, dude I will make the video like, yeah I know I'm a romaker and I hate to be a drama channel but this needs to be addressed, 18 plus romics would go crazy, there's a few like that already, in a year when I see you on the YouTube trending page I know exactly what it will be, the worst part is, now that I said that, if there ever is genuinely a pdf file on the Mario 64 community, and I do wanna make sure people don't like give him attention, people are going to think it's a joke, I don't think it's a joke, I don't think it's a joke, I don't think it's a joke, that's all jokes though, I really don't wanna be one of those drama YouTubers, that sounds like the absolute worst, I'm modeling the tops of those, because you can go there, from here, I wanna show you, so you get the idea here, it's very cool actually, more, I was trying to type too much food, okay, good attempt, good attempt, Mario vs Luigi minigame bonus hour, we already have the bonus stuff all covered, do you guys hear the train, the venga bus is coming, let's further down, dude I love how labyrinth like this is, no more cumshake, yeah we already had the cumshake, now we are saving for the next thing, which I think is the tuna shake, and this time I made it a group goal, how's the progress on the GTA Mario 64 hack going, there was no progress in a long time, it's the guy that commissioned it, kinda like stopped caring for a while, but he recently came back and hopefully I'm gonna finish it up soon, this is not the place I wanted to go to, this is the place, yeah, so there's a secret pipe here, and if you go into the pipe, you come out here, and then from the pipe you can collect the Yoshi coin here, and now you're here, from a completely different angle, this is the main level, yep, this is course 13, this is a pretty big castle, we're currently working on texturing this, I think the platforming here is mostly done now, there's also this path that you can take, a little shortcut here, not even close, ah, I'm cheating, tuna shake was redeemed, oh shit, I didn't see that, wait, how many times, no, no, no, no, the tuna shake gold says 1 out of like 115, one time, tuna shake, current progress 2 out of 10, it's a group goal, you all have to contribute to it, we should add sides to that slide, which slides, but yeah, this is another path through this, and I like this a lot, and then you can keep going here if you want, and there's so many different ways to the castle, and now I'm here, from this room, and now you can get AFJS running on NSO, and thanks to the emulator I have managed to get started running with the DTZ file, but I don't know how much I'm gonna need to alter to get it run on other, I doubt the NSO emulation is good enough to run this game, oh, you mean these, yeah, they are very temporary right now, we're working on them, yo, thank you for the bits, who sent those, god, I can't see any twitch notifications right now, wait, I will see the bonus bits in a second, thank you for the bits, tea time, all right, how do we handle this, wahoo of the abyss, I don't think it's that difficult, this is actually a funny effect that's happening, I get a lot of people saying this is too difficult, and then I get a lot of people saying this is too easy, and then I had simpleflips fail my hack like 15 times on something super simple that any noob could do, and then people were like, well, typical case tier difficulty, I as a normal player will never be able to play this, you play videos like this a and you're a millionaire, video games are usually about having fun and exploring fantastic worlds, but sometimes they can feel much darker, today we're diving into one of those baffling mysteries surrounding the already mysterious Super Mario 64, the most terrifying level in Super Mario 64 has to be Worms Fortress, scary blocks of concrete that want to murder you, grotesque plants with teeth, and this endless void of nothingness that threatens to swallow you at every jump, but the mystery we're diving into today is much more terrifying than all of this, you see, there's a star that requires you to shoot Mario towards a wall, then the wall breaks and the star spawns, but if you instead aim at the other wall, it breaks, but then, nothing, it is simply an oversight from the devs, or was there originally more to the star that meets the eye, we might never know, all we have today is this gaping hole where something might have lived before, but we'll never know what. I'm off work because we just had a child, so it doesn't matter to me. Too spooky? Yeah, understandable. There's also an Ocarina of Time role-making competition that I'm gonna be a judge of, you'd think that would be a banger video to make about, being like, I judge these Ocarina of Time romhacks, here's what I think. Then I just edited like a MrBeast video. Oh my god, I still have to make the MrBeast video, you know what I mean? I hacked every N64 game in one day. Next April 1st for sure. I used to math tutor children when I was a child. I used to math tutor my dad when I was a child. I don't even know why I did it, I never did anything with the money I got from tutoring. I was the stingiest kid alive. So next April 1st will be a collage of every visible ball on R64. Ah, that's a good one too. So I have too many April 1st ideas. That's because we necessarily are going. Oh, it's basically done. Um, I can show you real quick. That's the last thing I did. Oh yeah, I made that guy last, the collie wobble. He doesn't have animations yet, but we can fight him. All right. We have, um, 120 stars finished actually. It feels so jarring to look at 30 fps Mario and vanilla physics and stuff. I still need to import this into the rtyi engine though. These are one-to-one parts of the disperse, by the way. This is exactly the same renderer as Banjo-Kazooie had. Isn't that cool? Any level you want to see? When I say it's a kaizo, does it mean that you developed it? No. Kaizo is a Japanese word and I think it means asshole or something or unfair. Basically, a kaizo is just a really unfair game and difficult. Oh yeah, I made this guy recently. Hello salami. Do I think this will run consistent 16 on rtyi? No. I imported the banjo levels without any of the culling settings. So this should run worse than normal Banjo-Kazooie. Unless Banjo-Kazooie is so god-awful that even without culling my engine is better. And I think it just might. Kaizo translates to rearrange in Japanese? Really? From the games that are called kaizo you'd think it means asshole. I think I'd not possibly have developed those games. Yeah. I'm not the one making all those kaizo games. I made a single kaizo game. It's called Chromatic Tick Tock Tower. That's true, Salami. I remember you were here a while ago. The rats will be in this course outside the castle. There will be a hall outside area. I wish I could see how many viewers I had because I wonder if you're doing better than usual or worse than usual on the bonus stream. Thank you for the sub. I will be able to see who did that just now in a few seconds. Thank you for the sub, Remor. Now that was a follow. God damn it. This input lag is crazy. All right, well, I don't know who that was, but thank you for the sub, unknown stranger. Oh, Lurky the Lurker, ayy. There we go. Very appreciated. Oh, God. You're 73. Okay, that's about average, I think. How to follow active quads being fucking broken. Yep. Thank you for that, Blender 4.0. Very appreciated. You thought the invention of WebP was the worst? Wait until you hear about the new follow active quads in Blender. When the world is up and down, you run in clouds and there's huge pine trees that almost reach the clouds you're on and the leaves fall upwards. That's insanely specific. That sounds like a dream you had. So, power low seems rude. Oh, yeah, I'm definitely going to make my own game at some point. You're building a slide? Nope. Yeah, WebP is bad. It's just annoying because when you try to save it, you can't open it. The annoying part about WebP is that there's no WebP support, but it's already widely used. Do I have a fair understanding of computer hardware? That's an intensely subjective question. What is a fair understanding? I don't know what you understand as a fair understanding. How can I answer that question? Given the information I have right now, my answer is probably. What get you interested in making? I saw a romeg and wanted to make a romeg. I saw a romeg and wanted to make a romeg. The reason I wasn't doing that is because when I select the edge, it also selects this stuff here. And I didn't want to select that stuff. I wanted to make sure I have only this material. I have a good reason. I have a good reason. What is a good way to learn C? If you need to learn a programming language specifically, then that means you first need to learn to program. Because if you're already new to programming, then every programming language will be completely obvious to you. So really, you should be wondering, how do I learn to program? And the correct way, according to me, if you really, really want to get into programming, is to learn with MIPS Assembly. And then after you learn MIPS Assembly, you will look at C and you'll be like, why did I ever think this would need to be learned? All right, I think this worked out now. How do you program without picking a language? Well, I mean, I suggested MIPS ASM to properly learn programming if you really, really want to get into it. So that's the language I'm suggesting. Well, you think the exclusion stuff take a long time to look at? Seems like magic, but maybe a lot of money went to get right in the levels. Nope, it should be very simple. I think I'll have it done in just a few minutes. Do you speak multiple languages? Yes. That might be the fastest way to learn to swim. But it's also the riskiest way to learn how to swim. When people think about German food, they think about like bratwurst and sauerkraut and think no one actually eats sauerkraut. What you should be thinking about if you think German food is Maggi Würze. And maybe Bockwurst. No, I'm not gonna Gazzini. Because it's not emulator compatible. Did you miss your first messages now? I don't know. Your first message says at least two. That's what it says on my screen. Don't forget lederhosen at the end. No, that's not Germany. That's maybe Bayern. Which is barely even part of Germany. Are there 32-bit floats? Nope. There are 16-bit assigned integers floating points. Eh, fixed points. Bockwurst, beer and blah, smoothie. What's your favorite country? This should be snow if you ask me. What's your favorite country? Popular in France. Well, why would you think popular in Germany then? Come on. What's your favorite German food? Currywurst is more of a German thing than Bratwurst. Yeah, but Bockwurst. That's gotta be the most German thing. What's your favorite German food? Ever since I moved to Canada, I've basically not seen any Bockwurst. But I've seen a lot of Bratwurst. I don't eat condiments. Do you need a dryer? Do you need a dryer? Yep. Splendid, every wall will have the same texture. It's not set in stone. Is it good to live in Canada? Well, it's a lot better than living in Germany. What are you good at? What are you good at? Experimenting, learning, experimenting with other people. Sharing in vibrant online communities. Do you have a girlfriend? Do I not have? Nope, I don't. Do you have a girlfriend? Nope, I don't.      I used to live in Austria. I used to live in Germany. Are you going to get blamed for it? They never take account of you for the mistakes. Stuff like that. Taxes are way lower. Marijuana used to be a bad omen. he sent my entire money somewhere to Switzerland, instead of to my Canadian bank account and when my mom went to him and explained to him that the money went to the wrong account. He was like No! I've been doing this for 30 years... I never make mistakes. You're wrong. What do I do for the ceiling here? Rock textures for ceiling? Rock on top of bricks? I don't know about that. You can try. That's gonna look bad. And not make much sense. It's fine to have something basic at first. We can still try and improve it later. Well, and I know Biobak is gonna improve this a lot. Really at this point I have resigned myself to like knowing that whatever I do is just kind of like a suggestion for Biobak and he's gonna make it look a lot better. And they should be separate so that when we actually merge everything by distance it doesn't fuck everything up. When did you skip the part of falling onto the moon and dodging the stars during the boss fight? Yeah, we skipped the part of dodging the stars because I just couldn't find a way to actually make them decent. I still have to go back to the boss fight and make a few changes. I'm not 100% happy with it. Tell me if there are any spilling out when we get to the final design. It's usually just the overall feeling I want to keep but so far we never ran into an issue with that. And you know what the feeling is, you are here in the streams, I imagine you know exactly what I'm looking for. Oh that's nice. I like this transition actually. But it should fade into white. I think I can make it fade into white if I set this to 1. Let me just make sure that's true. Mario does actually look like he's looking forward to the transition. I still want to work on those transitions. I think instead of being one action where Mario just kind of like holds his speed it should be just take away control from Mario. Yep, the only search missing is the red coins and the retro pipe. Although I do want some changes to the boss and... what the fuck was that? That guy attacked me from up there, that's a problem. Did the warp stop warping? Oh it turned into a retro pipe. Alright, let's check why the freezie was freezing me up there. Are the Yoshi guns already implemented? Two of them are, three of them are not. So yeah we're definitely in the latter half of the level already. I'm actually looking forward to course 14 so much. Course 14 has such a cool theme. It's thousands? me this ice level's name. I am not sure yet. We're still looking for a minty level name. We're not going with frosty fortress. We're also not going with cold castle. Okay. Hello Zelda. Oh, I know exactly what I want it to look like. Oh, that's cool. That's cool. Oh, it should use those walls actually. Damn this area looks so much better than the other area. The difference is ridiculous. The space world is world 15. The craft world is world 14. I also still need to improve parts of this area here to be honest. Like this part's all good. I like this part. This part's good. This part's bad because like you think you're sliding off. This part's fine. I think the walking here is not obvious enough. And also the walking here is not obvious enough. Oh, permafrost palace. That's a good one. Oh, flexing permafrost palace. No, that's a bad one. I think it should be more obvious that this like stops being a castle and starts being a cave. Minty mint castle. Perfect. Exactly the name I was looking for. Paradox summer. Yeah, paradox is a good word to put in.   yes, that is supposed to be gold phylax. I know it doesn't look great yet. So All right floppy fish, you are excused. Yeah, nibbles, that's what I was thinking too. So I don't know just indent them down so you can trick them into giving them a foot. I have no idea what that means. Dude, that schizo rumble just now reminded me. Have you guys ever heard of schizo scrabble? It's my favorite game right now. Hello Nintendo for life. No, but that sounds evil. It's not evil. It's great. I've been showing this to everyone. No, but please tell me more. All right, wait. I will show you guys schizo scrabble. I just gotta find a good one. Basically, okay, there's gonna be a hint and you're gonna get an amount of letters and you have to guess the word. So All right, we'll do this one. African river carries pirate leader repeatedly to chest spot. Who can guess this one? This is schizo scrabble. So Shit, I'm trying to hide the comments, but it's not working. Oh, well. Give me a minute. I'll solve it. Xena's dad was so upset in my head. I'll just let it play in so you guys can get an idea of what schizo scrabble is. 50 crossword clue is African river carries pirate leader repeatedly to chest spot. And this is one of my all time favorite clues because it just reads like it's about a pirate traveling up and down an African river over time to repeatedly bury or dig up their treasure. But the answer has nothing to do with a river or a pirate or treasure. And the wordplay is African river carries pirate leader repeatedly. I think we can probably all think of an African river, famous African river, the Nile. And we're told that the Nile is carrying the leading letter of pirate and it's carrying it not once, but repeatedly it's carrying it twice, which gives us nipple, which is a kind of chest spot. So that is one of my all time favorite clues. Okay, that one actually kind of made sense. But half the time he just sounds like a crazy lunatic. And that is, I love that. Just him going on a lunatic ramble about how occasionally means you have to take the occasional letters of the words. I'm convinced the guy makes these himself just to solve them. That is so stupid. Raises hysterium. What the hell? Dude, where's my material? The one I made specifically just for this. I'll just make a new one. Fuck it. Generally honest to God, we do 18 different daily word puzzles like this every night before going to sleep. Do you actually also do schizoscrabble? That's insane. I just see these when I'm pooping on Instagram. So the days in one, yes, zero hints. What the fuck? That's crazy. So I'm going to select how many microseconds could potentially be saved in this code. That's a good one. Do you have any workout tips to get more mass and bulk? Lift heavy. If you ever hit a plateau just do something insane. I thought plateaued like last week. I did 90 reps of 255 pounds bench press that day. And now I no longer feel stuck. Just like over the entire day. Every 10 minutes I'd get up and do a few reps the entire day. Now this fades too early. I have indeed thought about those things before and I don't think it's that simple. Making a level I learned or at least for me is not just about sprinkling some purple or sprinkling some green or whatever. That's just not what works for me. I need to think about purpose first and then I can make more piece of that. Yep, that was only for big boost hold I think. Or maybe also for wing Mario over the sky. But yeah, it's not often. All right, I'm happy with this room here, this room and this room. Which room do we do next? This room or this room? Well, this room is super simple so I think I want to do this one next. But you know what? I think for today I'm done streaming. I gotta get my hair cut and I gotta get a few sets of last room races in. So I will see you guys in the next stream which might be end of the week, maybe not. My parents are gonna be coming to visit in two days so that's gonna keep me quite a bit busy. But I can probably stream on two days in the afternoon. Yes, Zena haircut. I'm not paying for a haircut. I'm making Zena do it. I don't care how stupid I look. But yeah, bye.
