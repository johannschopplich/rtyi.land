Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. Hello Zookeeper, welcome to the stream. What part of the world are we doing today? Hopefully we're doing 10 and 11 and maybe even 12. Hmm, any LST requests for today? Supposed to make the bridges moving more often from mushroom to mushroom? Yes, it is. I've already told you that I might do that. I already have done this in other levels. Yo, is this one of those live reacts formats in your format? That would be an insane April Fool's joke if I just spent the entire stream reacting to political content. And said I don't care about this the whole way through. Hello Daily Delphox. Dude, I should just be like a politics streamer today. It would be very funny, but I do not want to waste the whole day. So unfortunately, we're not doing that. Ignore this. I should just do a crypto rug pull. I call it 64 coin. I did not mean to go here. Sorry. Hello SuperM. I am glad you enjoyed the moist case video. I think I actually do have a note in my notes already telling me to do exactly what you asked for. Yep, this is the mushroom planes. Okay, today we have a bit of an issue we need to solve. And that is the issue that once you unlock part 10, you can go to part 11, part 12, part 13, 14, and 15. And this is a bit much. For that reason, I want to lock part 13 and 15 away. That means we need a barrier right here. If you look at this, this is part 11. You can just go there and this is part 10. You can just go there and this is part 12. You can just go there. And I'm thinking what we should do is make it so that this path here, right here, that that requires something else to happen. And also this path here should require something else to happen. New pause menu. Is it new? Or what do you mean? I mean, we are going to have to make a new pause menu, yes, with the map. But we're not doing that right now. Hello, Technic Master. Dude, it's actually going to look so cool if you press pause and you see a full world map here of all the parts you've been to so far. Oh my God, dude, I'm going to love that. What's course 12? Course 12 is Grand Sand Badland, but I think you want to know about part 12, which is a volcano area. There's going to be a fat Yoshi and he's going to help you move forward. Basically, once you beat Bowser 2, there's going to be like a super happy tree seedling growing here and you can climb up on it and get to part 11 or part 10. Regular UI element or 3D map unfolding. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You see this? What if we had this unrolling? Oh, that's such a cool idea. We're doing that. When you open the pause menu, an animation of this type of map unrolling happens. The song gets better the longer it goes? Fine, we'll listen to it. This will be our OST for today, I guess. drugmario-design.txt Look, it's an important document. Anyway, this is one entrance here. Oops. Uh-oh. What happened here? I just put the warp too low. Also, also, we need to find a way to beta test. Like, um, design test. Basically, what I need is a reliable way to just find people that are willing to play my game for me. I do need this because I want to do a bunch of gameplay testing. So I want to just send someone a ROM and then they play through like one level. And then I look at the entire uncut footage. They will be instant warps, Kazini. But we're not doing that right now because we can't make them seamless right away. For obvious reasons. Okay, why is this fucked? I see no reason why this would be fucked like that. Hmm. I'm thinking maybe I can get like a Discord server of beta testers. And then for every beta, I send it to like two people or so. But like you'd be in the Discord server for like a year and get one ROM sent. And that would be weird. Player behavior, not bug testing. Dude, what the fuck? Okay.  Huh? Okay. This is also just gone now. What the hell? Wait, this is part of area two? Oh no. Something went wrong. Okay. Yeah, it's like the collision does a lot. Never run into a bug like that. Anyway. We also need to think about the barriers. So the mushroom planes should be locked behind something. And I'm not sure what they should be locked behind yet. And... No, not the mushroom planes. The mushroom planes should have an out to the beach that should be locked. And the volcano should have an out to the beach mountain type area that should be locked. Question is, how do we want to do it? What in tarnation? What is going on? This is completely fucked. They all work fine except for area five. I'm wondering when do I actually think of the analog 3D? It has a very thin use case. There's little reason to use the analog 3D over just using an emulator. Because in the end, the analog 3D is also an emulator, right? But if you're like rich and you value just the vibe of playing on like a PC, a piece of hardware, then I can see it being worth it for you. No RAM? I really don't think so. We have much bigger areas than this. Man, I didn't want to spend my time on this today. Oh wow. Wait, this is 3,000 triangles? How is this 3,000 triangles? What the hell? Maybe it was too many triangles. Out of collision data rather. You thought Drag Wars was going to be the April Fool's joke? No, it's not a joke game. Drag Wars is a game that I've been commissioned to make. Someone paid me to make the whole thing. There we go. So the lava area is going to be also from a happy tree seedling going up here. And then you're going to walk down a rocky path here and then you're going to be in the lava area. Map is looking phenomenal. That is a surprise. It looks like dog shit. Anyway. Someone was saying a bird that you hatch from playing through Course 10, Lofty Lumber Leaps. It kind of works but Course 10 doesn't really have a story to it. So I don't really like that.  Egg on a roll? Wait, what if hatching the egg does that? Mushroom apparently for Course 1. Yes. I mean, in a way you can say that Course 1 is deep inside the island, like right here. You know, I think it kind of makes sense. We could add a secret back entrance here to Course 1. Like what if you had to do something here and then that would lead you to Course 1. And there's no purpose to it other than the fact that you can do it. You like that idea? Yeah. Does it still look like a Yoshi? No. Then the question would be where does it lead you if you find the secret back entrance. There is a barrier, you need stars for that. Tea time. Hello Beta. Where would the secret back entrance lead you? Hmm. And would there be a purpose to it? I say no, there would be no purpose to it. It's just a thing you can do. I saw a bunch of YouTube shorts recently where it's like 5 secrets in Ocarina of Time. And it's all like the most random useless thing ever, but like it's cool that it exists. It's like you can do whatever you want and the game will respond. And I think that's kind of how video games should all be like. And adding a secret back entrance here that does nothing is kind of cool. What if, what if... What if... Hello Yoshi Party. In case did you notice, YouTuber Dom Tendel. Yes, I know Dom Tendel. I have talked to him actually. Sure Yoshi Party. You know what would be fun? If there was a random barrel in the background here. That you can't reach normally. But then the secret entrance leads there and there's a blue coin switch with a bunch of coins. And like the whole time you play this course you're gonna be like how do I get there? And then like half a year later when you reach the third overworld you finally get there. What the fuck? What the fuck? Or it could go inside the windmill. But then like how do we explain to the player that they're inside the windmill? Because I noticed people really want to enter the windmill. No, it's not a hole in collision. It's just part of the collision handling function that must have an issue there. Hmm.  Hello Mario Luigi. Yes, you cannot enter the windmill. Like the inside of the windmill. I don't know what people will understand. I'm not sure. I know SLX and that's why we added the door. We just wanted to tease players. But also it makes logical sense that there's a door. So if the secret entrance went into the windmill. And well actually we can just put the Bunny Brushwoods OST in there and kind of muffle it. What if the secret entrance just led to the windmill with the Bunny Brushwoods OST playing? And you could exit it back into the overworld. And then there's just like a blue coin switch, a windmill mechanism and a bunch of blue coins that you can collect. Although that would make this like a really attractive spot for coin farming, which I don't like. Yeah, Biobank, I was thinking that too, but then I couldn't think of like a good way to make that work. Unless we also add an exit to the windmill. Somewhere. I guess you could exit from the door here. You need a coin farming spot or gambling. Yeah, I can kind of see that. Okay, so what if the secret entrance led into the windmill and was basically just a room with a windmill mechanism. And then on top of it, there are coins. And you can platform up to the coins and collect them. And you can exit the windmill into course one. Okay, so what if the secret entrance led into the windmill and was basically just a room with a windmill mechanism. I don't think we're going to have that issue, Biobank. I think there's going to be so many coins that you can get all the necessary items. Items pretty easily and then you can buy a bunch of optional garbage that doesn't really do anything. At least that's how I had planned it. We can't just put star 6 into like the third overworld that you get to with 60 stars, because like then you couldn't complete this. Yeah that would be like the way I imagine this. Imagine like here there's like a secret burrow you can go into and it's like an underground tunnel and at the end of the tunnel you have a warp that leads into the windmill and then you are just inside the windmill. It's like underground, because you know body brushworks, they dig. I think that works, this is an important DM. Yeah, I like that, kinda. C1, back entrance, push a rock that's over a hole that is a bunny barrel. This leads into the windmill from C1. There is a bottom deck entrance and the door to exit to the main area. There is a windmill mechanism like OOT in the middle. There are wooden planks above this with a bunch of coins. Did you one time played Buck Bumble? Nope. I have not, but I know that theme. This works, okay. Not what we came here to do, but this works. We have a banger OST today. We are gonna get so banned. We are gonna get so banned. Wait, did it actually get shut down entirely the last time? Shit. Okay, maybe we need to stop here. Nevermind. We are not listening to this in its entirety, even though it's a great song. Does YouTube not know I'm streaming? We guess we need a new OST. Okay, this is a very important question. Will consoles sync incompatibly through the ages? Or Super Mario 64 on the stereo version at some point? No. I typically don't go back to alt text and adding console compatibility to a hack that already exists is a pain. Although maybe one day someone will build like the tools to port text to my new engine and then it's kind of reasonable. But that day is not today. Like, unless there's a way to significantly make the process simpler. I'm not doing it. I think this works. Sonic OST. Okay, just Sonic OST. What did you guys think of the slop video today? Do you think I should do more? People seem to really like this. Look at it. It's doing so well. I feel like that's gonna be the most popular video on my channel soon. RM2C is not going to be enough to port the hack. No, no more. We've had enough. Please stop. But people love it, dude. It gets so many views. YouTube's telling me this is good content. Slop video was too long. Didn't watch. Well, being long is the point of it. The best video. Keep them coming. Sure thing, bro. All right. Anyway, we need to think about this. How do you unlock this? What options do we even have? Back entrance is super cool, but it doesn't work. They add a parallel cam to Xcoop. What did I have before? The hell? Hi, I'm Mr. Gaze and I forced 200 people to beta test my oldest Romhacks. Oh, no. With analog camera and vanilla. But you can't stay in your sorrow. You fade into the day.  But you can't help but follow. I put you right back where you came. What are you trying to do on the model? I'm thinking about the way to block off part 13 here. After you beat Bowser 2, you can enter this part here. You can enter this part here. You can enter this part here. You can enter this part and you can enter the clouds. And that's too much. That's overwhelming. For that reason, I want to block off the beach party at the end. Which also, by the way, has the Bowser drill. And the clouds above it. Right now, you could make this connection here. And get around once right away. And I also think that's too much. I think that's over-choicing the player. So, if just going here and here is a thing you can do. And going here is a thing you can do. I think that's much more manageable mentally. That's why I need to block off part 13. I'm working on Return to Yoshi's Island right now, Speedy. It is going to be done eventually. We have all 15 courses done. Will the ice castle and the space course be? The ice castle is planned here. No, the ice castle and the space course is in the sky, of course. This is going to be the handcrafted one. There's a target audience for the sec. Casual players that want to go on an adventure. And experience freedom and stuff. There's a mountainous area here. So, it is going to be on top of the mountain. There might be penicills around, yes. So, anyway. Mushroom area. Throw an enemy. Okay, the problem is we need an unlock. So, just doing a thing doesn't work. It needs to be something that is restricted until you make some progress in the game. It could be like a star barrier. But I think there's no real good way to do that. Or it could be a barrier of... Maybe you have to go to the volcano level to be able to enter this. Or you have to go to the sky level to make a barrier to enter this. But ideally, both would unlock both, maybe. Well, I guess if one unlocks, both need to unlock. So, maybe you need one star in each course to be able to enter part 13. It's probably the best way to do it. So, in course 12 you can let jail criminals. Course 10 you are on the trees. Course 11 is Bowser's oil tanker. If you beat the boss in Bowser's oil tanker, you already unlock a side level. At least that's the plan. So, we shouldn't make that unlock anything. I think that would be a bad way of doing it. Or we could make it so that you have to do something both in part 11 and part 12. Part 10 and part 12. So that part 13 opens up. No, he cannot throw fireballs. Also, at this point you already have all the power-ups. Like, after Bowser 2, you are supposed to be free to do the entire game, basically. That thing bad would work in course 12 to course 13. You mean part 12 to part 13. If I've been in Mounties, I'll be able to get the star above them. No, they need to unlock at the same time.  If they don't unlock at the same time, you are able to enter here, but not here. That would suck. Imagine you're here. Now you need to go this way, this way, this way, and this way. And then this way. When we could just tell the player to go this way. Lofty Lumber Leaps is right here. And Grand Sand Vatland is right here. And there's one side level here. That's like a Greek garden level that Martisti is working on. Late game allow long course. It will only fall, persevere, and players have increased their lifespan with hard challenge. Well, that hopefully won't be an issue. Don't worry, I'm putting thought into this game. Yeah, Marti's level looks super cool. Maybe there's some inspiration in Marti's level here. I should write them again. I don't know how much of this level he wants me to show. It's like on hills. I don't mind. For LRL, the immediate idea is a big egg that hatches at some point and gives you an NPC. Yeah, in Lofty Lumber Leaps there is the egg roll star. Egg on a roll, where you have the egg and you roll it down and it hatches a baby bird. So this being a way of unlocking it wouldn't be terrible. What I don't like about this is that it means that there is no way in course 12 to unlock both these paths. That's very random. That feels not like a natural consequence. To have the volcano erupt. Although there's also a plan for a side level with rising volcano. So that wouldn't be terrible. I think the difficulty is because I want both paths to open at the same time. And maybe that's just not a good idea. Maybe instead of connecting it here, we should be connecting it here. So that you can go from the volcano, which is here, directly to this area here. One of the areas for instance. Well, I'm adding the areas after the ideas we have. So I don't really feel like I can do it that way around. But maybe connecting the volcano here is a better idea. And then this is all just one thing, I guess. This could be unrestricted. There would be no issue with that. And then we just need this one restriction here, which we can do with the bird. I don't really like that you have to beat a specific star in a specific level though, to make progress in the overworld. That feels wrong to me. Like I think it's fine for side levels, but not for main levels. Hmm. Maybe there should be an event. I think event is the solution. Overworld event. Yeah, that's true by the way. Or we could just say the bird flew down or something. What overworld event would fit? We still need to plan a few. Pirate invasion. Pirate invasion. Okay, this one is planned. These two are not planned. Bowser's Yacht. Okay, that's a funny one. I don't know exactly where this goes to. Hello, I've flown down to the north beach between the beach and the hilarious. Might be a quick way to open both paths.  Hmm. Nah, I think we should just give an overworld event a try. Something where it's like collect X amount of stars and then this thing randomly happens in the overworld. And that helps you open up the path. I think that's the ultimate way of doing this. And it's fine if there's only one entrance to part 13. I'm not complaining about that. Do you guys think this still has a bit of a Yoshi shape? Oh god, this was my Yoshi shape. This feels not very Yoshi shape at all to me anymore. It's a Yoshi inspired shape. Well, I guess you can kind of see the Yoshi shape here with the eye. Then the other eye has like a spike maybe? You can re-Yoshi it later. Okay, that sounds tough. But I think it's fine if it's not a Yoshi shape. Actually, it would be cool if it was a Yoshi shape. Oh well. I can't listen to this Sonic garbage anymore. Give me something good. Like this. Okay, overworld events. Let's think about Yoshi's Island enemies that we can put here. Aqua Lakitu. Interesting. Barney Bubble. You can see a little title screen miniaturization of the island that looks like Yoshi. Can we fudge it here? No, we have a world map so we can't fudge it. Boobla. Huh? This would be a fun event. These feel like something that would happen as an event. You know what I mean? Like they would just randomly show up and haunt the place. I kind of want that to happen somewhere Maybe here it feels like that would happen here But you don't really have a reason to revisit this place once you've eaten it so What if there was like Pandora's box here and you could open it and as soon as you open it the ghost infestation starts and they're like everywhere and you have to destroy them for a star I'll do that in a second. Let me think about the booblas first. I kind of like the boobla infestation That probably will be Yoshi party Let me note that down At the secret entrance to part 3 above course 5 There is a Pandora's box If you open it Booblas burst out and haunt the area Destroy all the booblas for a star Yeah, exactly Wait, where's this meme? Where's this meme? Where is it? Where is it? It's like this get away red you carry of disease I also carry presents. Oh, it's anthrax Okay, I thought the meme was fun, yeah, I thought it was like pestilence or something Okay, let's see what else we got Allies you want me to look at enemies? I think allies is good, too He's an ally it's crazy balloon bully is an ally twice What the fuck  Serial radius maybe I Don't bungle Wait, I saw this game yesterday Shit, how was it called? I think it's a SNES game Kongos events or something I Played random games yesterday on on the online thing and this is insane. Wait Okay Oh This dude is doing so much extra shit Can you just get to the the thing what it's like two minutes of gameplay to get there Here it is. You see that? What the fuck is that? Is that a big fat Yoshi? Huh They made this He's so cool, I almost want him in the game It techie sack I The bone dragon would be so cool in the lava area Should we just randomly make him a boss in the lava area like fuck it or maybe it's just chilling there the bone dragon What If the bone dragon was in the lava area and he was like pissed and attacking you the whole time and you can't damage him and He has like His splinter stuck in his bone and you have to pull it out and as soon as you pull it out He becomes a friend I Want to befriend the bone dragon that that's why like I literally just want to befriend the bone dragon This is why I'm thinking of the star It's just the thing I want to do You Well, maybe a splinter is not the right thing but like in that direction what would bother a skeleton No, I just want the one head ally what would bother a skeleton if you did it to it, how would you help a skeleton? Give it milk Poochie stole his bone Yeah That would work well, so what do you do you ground pon Poochie to make him spit out the bone? What if this was the way to enter the secret level actually the side level You have to help him and then as soon as you help him, he becomes like an elevator You Maybe Poochie just hit his bone somewhere And you have to like take it out, I don't know what would bother a skeleton All bones no bother  Mean Hmm I Mean just write this down for now There is the Yoshi's story Dragon one hat here. He's pissed You can be friends in by 10 million animation bonds entity actually won't be that much. It won't be pretty cheap. Actually. This is not expensive to render Well, okay, it is somewhat expensive to render but it's manageable What do you do to him Throw eggs or ground-pounded How do you what okay wait I I Can't think of anything Nintendo 64 spieleberater die Dr. Pepper diet hat gewirkt Abgemagert bis auf die Knochen aber immer noch feurige Atem. Oh, yeah, it says it right here That's funny And didn't know there was a dr. Pepper diet You Skeleton Dragon No, really, let's check that out What is the last post This one This is bullshit And where's the law drop Oh Vinegar makes bones soft. So you're thinking he's in a vinegar pit instead of a lava pit I Think I'm shake the whole time. Let's be a bit rough visually. I guess that's possible You What if you had to be a chiropractor I don't know if I can encourage chiropractor see But What if he just had like an achy back and you need to ground pound it and then he's like, oh man My back feels so much better. Now that was killing me You know, that's just a hat wait what Oh I wasn't gonna give it a whole body like this. I was just gonna have it be a hat coming out of lava like this Yeah, like this kind of Yeah, you wouldn't see the body Hello sir, Viola Bro, what the hell am I watching? Oh Marty The It's just gonna be one hat not three at least I wasn't blind because I want the player to just prevent one of them I Mean I guess we can make three hats if we have a better idea for how it's gonna work with three hats The engine can handle that either way But yeah, I had one had written down Hmm What if it has like a toothache and You need to like punch out his tooth or something. I feel like a skeleton would have a toothache, right? It's skeleton would have a toothache What if what if one of the teeth was like black and rotten and you had to like punch the tooth Let's disagree on the subject so they ask you for your opinion So they wouldn't attack you at all. They would just be friendly from the get-go. No fight I Like the idea of a cavity I Think this shouldn't be dialogue based. I think it'd be cool. Like you enter the area. There's a lava pit The bone dragon hat is just looking out of it And he has one rotten tooth and he like spits fire at you And when you come close he tries to bite you and you just go up to his teeth and punch it and as soon as you Do that his eyes change to friendly and he's like, oh my god. Thank you I was in such a bad mood because of this cavity I had but I feel all better Hey, if you want you can climb on my hat and I can take you for a ride I think that's perfect He's pissed because of a cavity he has when you come close to him He bites and you can punch his tooth this explodes the two he becomes friendly and Thanks you and tell you that you can take you right on his He knows if you want how large is this MF? Oh, he's a large very large In this world like once he's fully extended I'm thinking it's probably like from here all the way to like here I Think you for forcefully ripping out one of my teeth. Yes You get him a new oh, that's a cool idea. What if you can make him a goal to Should we do that Make it so you can make a gold tooth for him and then he gives your star for that as a thank you That's too good of an idea it's cute I like it When you're inspired from trial if you have a bone based creature What if one lost a bunch of bones in another and you collect them back to reconstruct them? I don't really like like item babysitting and I think it's going to be a little bit of that That Also sounds like a lot more text and I kind of want to avoid text-based stuff as much as I can I Mean why is this so fucked? This is not how it was supposed to be was it? That made no physical sense dang I Think he's Head on one bone and the bones you bring him the longer he grows. Yeah, the Blazing Burrows are below the volcano. I think it's very fitting that way. Yeah, you're gonna ride the Bone Dragon this way. Couldn't it be like a boss battle where you have to defeat him to turn him friendly instead of just a simple punch? It could be a whole boss battle. Okay, this is the thing though. Yes, you look at him, you expect a boss battle, but do we really need a full boss battle? Isn't it way funnier and way more impactful if you don't get the boss battle you expect? If there is a dissonance between the visual language we use and the actual thing that happens in the game to have this feeling of like, wait, this is not what I thought it was. This guy is actually a friend, he's just in a bad mood. Not about subverting expectations, more about making the player consciously feel the dissonance so that they reconsider what they thought was given. Is he just a sunshine thing? Yeah, I can see that criticism. Mario Sunshine did a very similar thing. Well, okay, I think Mario Sunshine is still different enough so that it wouldn't be copied. I wasn't thinking of Mario Sunshine at all when I was doing this. I was just thinking of the Fable of the Mouse and the Lion. I don't know if you guys know what that is. Basically the story goes there's a big scary lion and there's a tiny mouse and everyone's scared of the lion because the lion is very pissed and angry at everyone and he yells a lot. But then it turns out that the lion just had a splinter stuck in the paw and the mouse pulls out the splinter and the lion is very thankful and they become best buddies. That's kind of the story I want to evoke. Yeah, boss battle music would be a given. I really, really do think that the tooth is our best option right now. And then once you become his friend, you can go into the rising lava section. And then I also like the additional idea of making him a gold tooth. As in you collect 500 coins and then that builds a tooth and now he has a gold tooth and he's like, wow, you're my best friend ever. And maybe he gives you a star. Maybe you just become best friends. I don't know. Well, I think he should give you a star actually, because otherwise people might be disappointed. Or we could do it like once you do that, he just has a different animation upon seeing you. He just gets happy or talks to you or something. Just like something that doesn't make any progress, but it's a permanent change. You know what I mean? You guys think that would be fine if buying something didn't give you anything. Instead, it just gave you like a different enemy interaction, NPC interaction. He does give you an entrance to a secret level already. That's the whole idea. There's a volcano level here that he elevates you up to. Don't you need more overworld stars? I do. But I'm not sure if this should be one of them. Overworld stars are very valuable. True, Marty. Best buddies forever, that's what I vote for. So, are we just going to have like a goldsmith here? That's like, oh man, if you want to fuse 5000 coins together, I can build that guy a gold tooth or something. Would it have to be 5000 coins? I think it should be a lower number. No, you get into the hidden level just by punching out the tooth and making him a friend. The coins afterwards, that would be for a star or for nothing. The exact coin amount doesn't matter for now. So much buildup in dialogue? Yeah, I can see that too. So maybe he gives you both the secret level entrance and a star. Alright, I'm just going to write this down as well. After you befriend him, the local goldsmith or the local smith... Who would be a smith? Hmm... Do any of these make sense for a smith? Is there like a guy with a hammer or something? There's a hammer bros, but we don't use hammer bros in the game, so no. I understand your concern, Violac. I don't think it's a big deal that it's similar to Mario Sunshine though. I think the Mario Sunshine one is also different enough that it doesn't really matter. Because the Mario Sunshine one is an actual boss fight. This one's just like a little fun interaction. More like a puzzle, almost. Hello, Cream Demo. There's so many enemies in this. A more true... Offers you to smelt 500... Wait, maybe 200? 200? Question mark. Points into a gold tooth that you can carry to the dragon for a star. And after the star is collected, he has a happy animation whenever he sees you. I assume that will be enough. But there's two things you do. Anyway, this is good. I think these are just overworld hidden stars and not events, actually. Bone, dragon, gold tooth. I think this is gonna make the overworld feel really alive, and that's what we want. Anyway, after all this, we still don't know how we're gonna do the entrance to part 13. And Marty, this is why I was talking about your life. I want your level to be around the third overworld here. Around course 10. I was thinking the entrance would be here somewhere. You could put like hills or something you enter. And I was thinking maybe once you beat the level, that opens the last overworld piece. I have a little bit of a problem with this, though. In that beating a level to open an overworld is not great. I'm also thinking maybe the geometry we have to add for your level is going to inspire an event that we can put. That makes it so that once you beat the event, you can enter the last part of the overworld. Because likely we would have to add some hills here, right? Some hills that you go through. I'm also not 100% sure on how these last overworld parts should connect. Initially we had this with one connecting this part here to the last part. Then one here. But maybe a connection here is better. Or maybe all of these should exist. Louvre style gates. Not sure I understand. Le Louvre. Okay, I see. Heh. Like this? Bro, these are massive. That's an interesting construction. Hello, Mushy. No madness to see on this day. Mushy, I'm waiting for the remake. Why are you dropping it? Castle of Visay? Yeah, I don't know. I swear, French words, like you don't pronounce them. Like you don't read the letters. You just kind of remember what the word looks like. And then you pronounce what you remember. Because half the letters you guys put in your words, you don't pronounce them. I really like the idea of unlocking the bone dragon before riding him to a star. Especially if at first you're just getting a prize for unlocking him. He sends you to a secret level, even. Would it be cool if there were some monuments over the island? Oh, definitely. Same thing with German. No, German words, you pronounce them as you write them. They update the language every now and then. The writing to accommodate for how spoken language has evolved. Onsen is pronounced Vassel. You Germans don't pronounce the S-B-H? Of course we do. Hä? Hä? Was? How many ways can you say the in German? Many. Schifffahrt. It's all pronounced. We have Stummes Haar. Really? What's Stummes Haar? Anyway. I think Overworld Event is our only option. Schifffahrt. It means traveling by ship. Schifffahrt.  Schifffahrt. Schifffahrt. Schifffahrt. Schifffahrt. Fahren or Mühe, Herr Stummes Haar? No, the H on Fahren means that the A is dragged long. And Mühe definitely does not have a Stumme Haar. At least I don't pronounce it like that. So the H that lengthens previous letter sounds. That's what I do. I feel like this isn't going to align right. Shit, did we make the island too big? Those are not German words, at least not to my knowledge. The jar. But even though they're not words, the pronunciation is very obvious to me. Mühe, like Mühe, sounds the same. I guess. But you can absolutely say Mühe and it wouldn't sound weird. Is a German word for Hamburger? Hamburger. The third one is, but if you pronounce the first two, the last one isn't like combining the first two. Benebelter. Seems pretty straightforward to me. How do you pronounce it? God, this overworld part is going to be giant if I just do that. We're going to have to make it so that the lava pit is here, I think. And then this will work, kinda. Then this can be like an entrance to the volcano. Hamburger is called Fleischscheibenwender. No, that's a spatula. Fleischscheibenwender. I will never work in an office now. When I have people around me for too long, I get extremely tilted. As in very irritable. How do we do this? This is rough. Yeah, it's the same as Sketchup, Moshi. We can just measure that. No intuition needed.    Okay. People that tell you that Blender is super difficult are just kinda insane, I think. It's not really any different from Sketchup. I guess the main difference is that in Blender you have a bunch of smaller functionalities that you have to combine together. Whereas in Sketchup you have big things that are also much more limited. Okay. I think this is our best option here. Let the volcano go into the sea. I guess you're right, yeah. This should be volcano-colored, I guess. I don't really share Blender. It's just a bit of a pain. Process Do we have our own don but musk I don't know Donald musk, is that what you're saying? Are you messing up? I Will be sending me all these teams. Oh, it's Marty Metal kit ornaments Hmm so just to get like this I don't know that that the problem with that is that Mario can just jump over it unless we made it a huge invisible wall And I kind of want to avoid that. I don't want the player to look at something and be like man I could just jump over this but The game is simply programmed to not let me I Want people to feel like any barrier that they encounter is a genuine barrier and not just the game telling them. No I Defounder being the richest man in Germany would make a lot of sense to me I Already is a banger though. I wish we had Aldi in Canada. I would go to Aldi every time Yes, I live in Canada I moved to Canada in 2021 Yes, I live in Canada I moved to Canada in 2021 Event hits I don't know it I Actually thinking about it we should leave a huge gap of space here just so that the island layout makes more sense I 51st state honestly, I wouldn't mind becoming the 51st state. Hear me out like yes Life in the u.s. Kind of sucks and like poor people are being taken advantage of like a lot And sure, there would be no health insurance, but on average For me, I think I would have more money left over because the income tax is that much lower in the US so like I can probably just like Imagine for the next 10 years. I don't have a heart attack and then I have a heart attack and I need to pay like a $300,000 medical bill I Think from the safe taxes that would make up for it He Did both Lidl and Kaufland's dang What a crazy man But wouldn't state tax still be just as high just a California I hope not There it's where we win every election if Canada joined the US yes, they would At least until they reprint a little bit And I mean, okay, this is actually what they do they all They naturally always rerent on the way that they're close to 50-50 splits. I mean they have to So I think that would just be one election cycle and then it's back to normal No Politician is going to tell you their honest beliefs. They're just going to tell you something then is like In the direction of the view But still not so far in that direction that less than 50% of people will agree with them That's kind of the goal. I think I'm on the east coast Nova Scotia You want to really just observe I would never vote I don't think voting does anything I Don't take advice on politics for me by the way, I'm just Just imagine me as like a homeless schizophrenic man and like that's my politics I Think just to help players we should have a very clear line of like where it is acceptable to stand and where it isn't I Think that would be kind of cool here We Actually ended up having the politics stream on April 1st as I had promised the beginning of the stream that's crazy I Just can easily make more sense Then we say he was in a lot of politics Most of politics that you hear online is rage baiting and like Preaching to the car because that's what gets you the views and online is all about grabbing attention and engagement I will not be streaming a Nintendo Direct now I Bought up 20 bucks direct Like the two Two out of twenty Like there's nothing I'm expecting When prediction tomorrow that will 100% happen anime game I What is there anything Supposed to happen in the direct tomorrow. I thought it was just gonna be the Nintendo treehouse where they play a bunch of games That they announced yesterday Is that not it You Okay, three C is what we want it's switched to stuff. Oh Yeah, why would I be excited for switch to switch to just means I have to buy a console again There's no other consequence to it. I guess it means developers are able to be less Sentient of the resources in developing video games so they can make video games faster Do I want them to make them faster? Yeah, I guess kind of nice that they can make bigger games for cheaper. I Don't think it really matters though I Mean they called it switch to ride. So like what are we expecting? Isn't it just going to be a more powerful switch? And you have to buy it again and it's just and there's an underground system already Right here, there's a little bit missing but yeah I Mean generally, what are you guys expecting of it's like, yeah While you're excited that the prospect of having to buy another console to play the new games you think it's gonna improve graphics that much Do you want the improved graphics you guys are watching me make an n64 game right now New games new games is exciting, but I would prefer if they release the new games on the tender switch So I don't have to buy a switch to I Said to see a family why are you excited to go to a restaurant? Why? Okay. Well, I'm not one to get excited to see my family the restaurant Mmm good food and good conversation I'm not excited for a trip to another country. I hate that. Do you have to join you? I have joined my heart The joy in my heart comes from exploring new things learning new concepts I Was saying man, this is gonna be basically the same thing just a slightly beefier CPU And GPU and it's like not gonna change the games. You're gonna play, right? To the console son, well They called it switch too, so I'm thinking there will not really be a new concept it's just gonna be slightly better CPU if they had called it like You know how the we had like the motion thing that was exciting Or the DS had a touchscreen I Three and three five, how did that not work? Yeah, they made it four five Fair enough Is What we do with Nintendo not tomorrow that they'll be releasing a new first game called return to your his island Free marketing I Saw that a club was working on Mario adventure to battle that seems like a banger. I sort of cuts the stream today Apparently it has like 515 stars the hell I Thought he released a demo He released a full version I'll be honest what I saw didn't really look fully cooked for a full version Okay, hero story only I Seen you new romech. What is it the 4,000 IQ quiz? Oh What the hell I wasn't even exporting this how was this working at all Did you actually make one today, how did I not see that I Well, it's like there was like a bunch of more like unpolished stuff like objects rotated the wrong way and Mario clipping into the ground for certain animation stuff like that so I thought it was just like a rough draft as and like Here check if this is fun and like I'll make the full version at some point that fixes all the rough edges So we're missing for the green comment the yellow comment, this is a romech of Arthur's romech Okay, I think we can put the train station here and this will feel like a good size So imagine you come here and the big bone dragon is just around the corner they're attacking you And then when you stand here, it's like the perfect range for him to try to bite you and you can punch his tooth out Yeah, so he's probably only making this like a very rough game Not trying to polish it up that's unfortunate because I like Sonic Adventure 2 a lot And it was like a fully polished experience. I would want to play it Let me look this up while back It's not showing up I Feel like I've seen this joke before these are all just in the normal spots, aren't they? I can see for you bullshit. He just put them back in the vanilla spots I mean, it's completely fair if he wants this to be just you know a rough game And where the concept is just like hey the maps are fun to run through here's Mario and go through the maps again Except everybody's every instance of power star with yellow star from the yellow comment L.a on site since I started YouTube I started YouTube in like 2010 Do you know the shit I uploaded in 2010? There's no way you saw that Let me see if I can actually find my old videos and if they're not too embarrassing to show Pokemon blau-rot 33,000 kp glitch That's my first video It's not bad, what do you mean it's just me showing a glitch I found with underflow Stop calling it cringe you are cringe You know what we didn't do after all this we still don't know how to block part 13 And I think at this point we needed There's going to be a train station here to go to grandson's Badlands, I think we're gonna have train tracks this way So let me just make the train station here Train station should be Shielded from the dragon, so I'm just going to put up the wall here. When I get stuck on something I just keep working on stuff and it comes at me at some point. I can't see that approach, but this is all about the planning. Getting stuck is kind of the point here I think. I'm going to make this a tunnel. I'm kind of just working on other stuff too actually right now. I am kind of doing what you're saying, but I have to bring the topic back around. Oh that's going to be so cool with the train tracks over there. Blender works pretty well with Unreal for me. Of course, Snoop will play it. I think this is a bit of a cursed problem to solve just because of how it's stuck in two different spots at the same time. This can be the entrance to the secret level here. I'm going to give it a red glow because it's going to look cool. Now, I don't want the player to just jump up here and this is definitely a jump up your height. Shit. Actually, that kind of entrance might look cool. Faces? You mean random objects and faces? Oops. I didn't mean to hit my microphone. I'm sorry for everyone's ears. Sorry headphone users. It's not going to be inside the lava, but it's going to be inside the volcano with rising lava. You have to get to the top. The last beach just has to connect these areas here and then we have a full 360 view of the island. Imagine how cool this is going to be. The whole world is going to feel so alive. There's going to be events. Everything's connected. There's no loading zones. You just go from thing to thing. It's just going to feel like a gigantic open world. It's going to be insane, man. Just think about it. The way from the last part to the first. I was thinking that there should be a way, yes, but I don't know what it is yet. There is the secret exit here that you can go through. Maybe we'll let the plane jump down from here to here somehow, but I don't know how. Yeah, I wonder who did that. Of course. That's what all these pathways are for. If you look at the pathway, there's always going to be a situation where I can just unload the previous area and then load the next area without having any problem. And this is everywhere between all the areas. I don't know if I want to connect the last part to the first, but one way they are connected is that this part here has the train. And if you go into the train, you come out here and you're going to see the train tracks from part one. So once you see those train tracks, everything's going to fall into place and you're going to see the train go here. I don't know the exact size of the volcano yet. I mean, I can make it bigger or smaller depending on what works in the end. So right now it's only 8,800 triangles. It is pretty low poly because it's all just concepting. We're not actually adding any detail to this. Anyway, there is one more part to this overworld and that is the last beach part. This part right here. And you can see right here, this is going to be where it is and this is going to be where it is. The problem is, I don't know how to make it so that you can't enter this right away and I don't want the player to enter this right away. Do we just section the beach off? The beach is closed because of coronavirus. That sucks. I don't have a solution. When the game is ready, do you plan to release just an NTSC version or are you planning a PAL version also? Maybe both, but right now only NTSC is being worked on. It shouldn't be difficult to also port it to PAL though. Shock warning. Ugh. No, all of these are kind of silly. Also put landmines. Hmm. It's difficult. That sucks. We could also connect this with a Kamek boss fight. Because I kind of want the player to boss fight Kamek once or twice in the overworld. What if there were like, you know those white blocks? Wait, wait, wait. These here, the talking blocks from Yoshi's Island. We could have these guys around the islands. And then there's a Kamek boss fight. Where Kamek is like, I'm getting all the yap blocks and turning them into my minions. And the boss fight is you have to beat a bunch of these turned evil somehow. We can make them evil. And then after you beat them, they make like a big pile somewhere. I don't know. But like, they are out of the way. I think it wouldn't be so bad. And then we could have more of these around the island that block other things. Where now that they're gone, you can go there. We could make the requirement like, oh, you need 60 stars and at least 1 star in course 10 or course 12. Something like that could work. I'm not hating it. I'm just thinking about how the fight would actually work. I like the yap blocks. The yap blocks are fun. And piling them on a big pile is also fun. And we could have small ones and big ones. Why a bird? How does this make sense? I like the yap block. What other secrets would the yap block be hiding? What would they be telling you? Where else would the yap blocks be? Maybe there would be a yap block in front of here telling you, hey, maybe something is going on inside the lighthouse. And you can talk to them by punching them or ground pounding them. And then there could be a yap block here that's like, oh, I'm sorry, I'm in your way. Unfortunately, I cannot move. CR 80. What advantage will you get by fighting Kamek? A star and the yap blocks will have moved. The question is, where would the yap block fight be? I kind of like the fight being in the first overworld here. Kamek could be like, yeah, I enchanted all the blocks on the island. Or even on the coast. Is that Banana Bay? I don't want it here because this is where the pirates attack. I like it here because this is nice and flat. Now, I don't want that doing something in the course opens up. Is there anything wrong with the talking block idea? I like the talking block idea. And it lets us talking blocks everywhere that we can use for hints and for comedy. There could be a talking block here. And then when Kamek enhances them, I don't know, they gain like lags. Imagine this is his friendly form. And then when Kamek enhances them, they kind of turn into something like this and start attacking you. You have to ground pound them to turn them back to normal. Seeing the block get transformed into a forklift would be very funny. Maybe the yap block is the right idea, but the Kamek fight isn't. But I feel like a forklift doesn't fit. Hello, Meepa. Doodlebot blocks. They are very funny looking. Or they would be very funny looking. And like an evil version of them is also very fun. I'm just worried that the forklift doesn't fit. The fight wouldn't make too much sense. Or we could have a full boss fight. But as soon as you get here, Kamek enhances the block. And the block starts fighting you. And that's just how it opens up. They could jump at you and ground pound and try to squish you like that. And if you squish them, you win. Or punch them even just. This always has to be a fight. How else is it going to work? I don't know.            That's the question, I guess. You see, I'm not really a fan of fights either. But I don't see a different possibility. When you move away, it happens like in the Gorilla Desert. A frog sends you to the beach. But the question would be why. But having a yapping block on both sides, I think that's a good approach. He's funny and he's very Yoshi silent. The hint block. Let's see. Bring the yappy block. Yep, I'm thinking so. I'm just thinking of a way for the yappy block to block both entrances to the part 13. I think there is a way. This is solvable somehow. I think I'm on the right track. Did it do anything? Roses are red, violets are blue. Never forget what I say to you. Yep. I have to block the beach until you have talked to enough friends. They just fly away from the beach entrance and you can pass. I think that could kinda work. They could be like sit- wait wait wait okay what if they were here and when you talk to them they're like hey I'm playing a hide-and-seek I'm setting up a hide-and-seek game with my friends they're not all here yet please wait and then once you have let's say 60 stars and one star in either course 10 or course 12 they talk to you again or you can talk to them again and they tell you hey we're ready now all my friends are on the island talk to enough of them and you win the game and then once you win they fly away something like that I mean it would be kind of fun to go all over the overworld again this is doesn't paper mario ttyd do this as well where they just kind of send you all over the overworld maybe each of them gives you a hint where the next one is so it's like a scavenger hunt almost and when you find one out of order they tell you hey you found me out of order but I'll still count it my next friend is here I think it's cool but it has the potential to really really suck the possibility of it really sucking bothers me hmmm maybe that's not a good idea it's too risky yeah I think the yappy block is the right character just not the right idea okay without the hide-and-seek part it makes no sense though um there's just these two yappy blocks here you they're they're giant ones you talk to them and they say something like I'm still thinking of where to hide for my game please come back later and then you come back later and they say I'm done now and then their face disappears and then it reappears four times and then it disappears and then reappears 16 times and now there's like 16 smaller blocks and these 16 blocks hide all over the world or maybe just four so there'd be like four times four blocks so 16 in total over the world I think it'd be very cool visual I can make it work it wouldn't be immediately annoying and the question is what do the 16 yappy blocks do once you find them this adds a whole other overworld event to this I guess hello diamond Yoshi does that work though now I have to hide 16 of these stupid blocks all over the world it's been going on we're thinking about the the exit here again and I had the idea that maybe we should use this guy here the the message block the yappy block because I think he's a very fun character he could be blocking the way we're just thinking about how to make it so that he unblocks the way the first idea was that Kamek would hex them into enemy creatures with arms and legs that attack you or something but I don't really like that the second idea that someone in chef had was that they would just sit there and eventually start a game of hide-and-seek with you and then hide all over the island or well I think their idea was that they would just be randomly over the island and you have to find enough to get through but I don't like that this just needs to be event form Yoshi so they're like evil yappy blocks they just insult you and then you have to make them friendly I don't think they should go back to a Yoshi I think they should just be evil and then once you help them they like become normal I think that's really funny like imagine there's just a huge block in the way and he just insults you with like baby insults what's a good rhyme wait wait one second one second I almost got it nevermind I got nothing good I was thinking something like who is stinky and won't pass the red plant but it smells like ass you know something like that is what they would say and and they won't let you pass Gruntilda has block true but you have to okay wait no the first thing he says is roses are red violets are blue never forget what I say to you come on even he would spit rhymes at you he would rap battle you timing is vital aim must be true measure the angled and win do I just need a I guess they could just mention that Kamek has turned them and then once you get enough stars Kamek just appears in the overworld then it's like wow you're getting too much stuff done I'm gonna make your life inconvenient and battle you they're too far away for that joke to land I think they should both talk about how Kamek has enhanced them so the player gets the hint maybe there should be more of that around here just evil Kamek magic that's like the theme after the second overworld everything's full of evil Kamek magic and then you undo that and then you can get everywhere so they're doing nice aftermath how do you and yes after you beat Kamek they would turn nice and they would move out of the way like after you they have a nice face you come close to them and they're like oh I'm so sorry for the things I've said I will get out of your way and then they move over here I'm just thinking about how the Kamek fight should go down where the Kamek fight should be and how the player is even going to figure out that there is a Kamek fight that they have to do Kristen is going to be unrestricted there's just going to be a gondola you can hop on no unlock maybe just a panicked Yoshi appears somewhere or a panicked Parakarry appears and they tells you hey Kamek has been up to no good come to the dojo to like beat her and then maybe the fight is she spawns sharks or something surely there's sharks in Yoshi anyway I think that works evil message block that insults you and rhymes beat the Kamek in boss fights in part 5 if you won't pass the red plumbum that's just without swearing afterwards the first time you approach them they have a friendly face and apologize then move out of the way approaching one of them should move both of them okay there's no 13 entrance here like this and then part 5 is going to have the Kamek boss fights Kamek boss fight event she doesn't like how much progress you've been making and tries to stop you somehow no fight planned yet maybe she just spawns sharks or something in that case I think we should only have one Kamek boss fight and we should also have more enchanted evil people in the last two overworlds beating her and does the enchanted evil message blocks maybe add more enchanted evil guys yep I think this works pretty well adds a new overworld event closes these is very funny and creative perfect checks all the boxes of what we need this is a bit awkward because I would like this to be higher hmm yeah I'm I definitely am bio back they're going mad about it okay I like that yeah let me add that to the list this seems more like an easter egg something like two Yoshis whose colors have been swapped and they hate it and want to go back just a text box change after leaving Kamek question mark maybe yeah that would make sense with like a green Yoshi and a cantaloupe Yoshi should we on our Yoshi model and the ability to add like patterns like that to Yoshi oh I see melon and cantaloupe are the same but I'm just gonna write that down something the question Marcus I'm not really getting it but yeah and this one's a little more questionable camera wise all right I think we are now in a position to do the last overworlds nice and it's looking to be a fine size too hello I will be done for now so I will see you guys in the next stream which is most likely going to be on Saturday unless there's another funeral or some shit like that hopefully not but yeah that's yep bye bye
