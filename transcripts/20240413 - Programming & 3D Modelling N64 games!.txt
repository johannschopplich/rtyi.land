Hello. Hello. I'm a bit late today because OBS crashed when I tried to start streaming. Why are you wearing a hat? There's reasons. Hello Tea Time. Hello Clayman. Hello Scallop. Coolhead. You guys don't want to see what's under the hat. Hello Christian Bittner. Hello Dawn. Did you try cutting your own hair again? No. No. Zayna cut my hair. And it turned out much worse than it would have if I did it myself. Is that course two? Yep, this is course two. Something terrible happened when she cut my hair. So you know you have a hair clipper and you go over someone's head with it. And there's like a thing at the top that prevents you from cutting it to zero. Well, Zayna basically took the hair clipper. She took the thing off to clean it. And then she just kept fucking going. Now there's a huge bald line on my head with no hair. Holy shit. True. No, I didn't. It came off. I put it back on. Well, you didn't put it on right. Because clearly it fell off. You fuck with the beanie? I'm not the biggest beanie fan. Is that? Yes. Wait. This. This is what I look like. I'm sure I look as sophisticated as Albert Einstein from this. Yo, thank you for the sub cybernetic elf. Who's Creek? Is that a self-packed character? Running UE5 right now. Nice. Nice. Yo, thank you for the sub. Zaina. Hey, is A.I. Anwar taking my job? Yeah. Wait, what happens? You look like a bald man trying to cover up that he has no hair while I am definitely trying to cover up my hair right now. And we were agreeing on levels. Oh, well, I'm changing the entire essence of this area. I'll show you what the plan here is. No, I don't want to go to a barber.  Look, first of all, barbers, you waste so much time. Second of all, they cost money. And third of all, I'm a guy who cares what I look like. All right. So the idea with this area here is there were these leaf bolts before that would just go you through a little bit of like an almost autoscroll section that you could speed up with good movements. But I realized the section sucked. So now we have a little bit of a platforming playground here. I said that a long while ago. I don't think that's the plan anymore. In fact, I am undecided on course 15 right now. We know that course 13 is going to be probably an ice castle like a mysterious type ice castle, like very, very suspenseful and stuff. And course 14 is going to be a space arcade. But I'm not 100 percent on course 15. Hopefully I can think of something while we work on the next two levels. Generic lava level true. Yeah. How much percent finished just above 80. We're getting there. Rainbow level, kind of like in the original 64. Battlefields. This year is going to be the year. No. Why is this kind of box so white? I might have made them bigger than the normal scatter box by accident. He definitely has a big kid box, right? Definitely should reduce that. Hello, cocky left. So and now we want to work on this area here. Make sure the platforming is fine. I was thinking a section like this with a little bit of a moving platform for one coin is decent. I thought we could sit up on there. I'm just worried that this is maybe too difficult for course to. No change, it's just the same level. Oh, just to like show everyone how shitty the original is by comparison. A whole new level. No, this is still a remaster of like the previous level, not a remaster, but like a complete change. We're reworking a previous area, which is in Dino Dino land. This level here. I know it's divine Dino domain. That's what it was. We have quite long loading times. OK, something's wrong for sure. Interesting, interesting. Maybe this is related to the really long loading time we had just now. This is not looking as it should. Oh my God. This is what happens when you use illegal programming. The other Dino level is still in the game. Yes, this one's just called Divine Dino domain. It doesn't actually have dinosaurs. Actually, it has a Yoshi, but yeah. Any OST wishes today? Margot 64. Thank you for the sub payback, Kitty. OK, Margot 64, at least. Actually, no, Margot DS. I'm feeling like it. So I want there to be a way to get up here. I want it to be less annoying to fall into the water here. So there needs to be staircases to get out on both sides. And then we need some above water platforming here. And some hanging rides here. And the Yoshi statue here. Dude, I think today on the new video I made, we got a comment from a real Nintendo 64 developer. Right here. Because this is just true. This man is speaking facts. And if you look at his channel, he made it today. I think he made the channel just to make this comment. And this is pure truth. This man is spitting facts. Hello, Yoshi Party. It's John Nintendo, yeah. 750 divided by 80 multiplied by 250. OK.  That's your uncle? I believe you. OK. I finished Course 12 off-stream, by the way. Mostly. There's a few more animations from Zeina I have to put in the game. But then Course 12 is all good to be shipped. Oh yeah, and some signs. Yeah. But all pretty simple stuff. Only three courses left? Yes. And I actually already started on Course 14. I have a whole area done on Course 14 that I can't show you guys. Because Eiza doesn't want me to show it. Because it's part of the compact. I worked on that one in secret.  Hello, Zeth. This is Divine Dino Domain. It's a level we made a while ago. But we need to fix some few things in here. Mainly this one sub-area. Because it sucks to play. Does it come out when it's done? Did you program that model on my N64 until I gamed? She would never. Dude, the comments I'm getting are insane. What is this? Double world is not 64 bits, it's 32 bits. This is false. What is this?  Dude, this is my newest one that I released. Just a few hours ago. I'm planning to make them a different color of silver. We haven't really worked on it yet. We haven't worked out the aesthetic here yet. We're just kinda trying to make the platforming fun. And then after we have the platforming, we're gonna work on the aesthetic. Oh, you're talking to me as Pulse Superior? Wait, how is Pulse Superior? I don't understand. I must have missed something. We're getting this to a level? Nope, this is a temple level. This is inside the temple. Let's not make any sense as soon as processes and upgrades, who cares? Yeah, just let the YouTube commenter be wrong. It is fine. It is not my problem. Like, blend the goop below the vertexes like in the ship you did with the poison. This is gonna be water, not goop. One change I do wanna make though real quick is in the main area right here. And that is this part here. Does the layout change? The collision mode also needs to change. What in tarnation? Unnecessary vertex, wow, this was not optimized.  What? Hi Case, I'm the guy from the Escribe camp, I know you. It's T, I'm your cat guy. I still haven't figured out whether you're playing a character or whether you just are the way you are. Do you have an N6NDD? Nope. We are not in this US, we're just at the bottom of the temple. I haven't worked on this game in like 3 years. Yeah, you should come back and write more code for me. AkiDev, wanna know what's even worse? I changed your Chain Chomp code just like a week or two ago. I changed a lot of it, because I wanted a second Chain Chomp in a different level. Clap, clap, clap. Why are you clapping? Wait, this area is underwater? Should not be. Interesting. Whoops. Fair. Upgrade the base N6ND anyway. I think it's just this area. Is this 1064 with the disc? So currently, unfortunately, there is a bug in the game, so I'm a bit scared to touch the water. Water hasn't been updated to the new step function yet and the old step functions are not fully supported anymore, so being in water can just crash the game. I wish OneDrive wasn't enabled on my computer, but I'm scared that if I disable it, it's gonna delete everything, cause everything is somewhere under the OneDrive directory. So I feel like when I disable it, it's just gonna destroy my entire PC. It's just a backup. Well, I don't want Bill Gates to have all my files, if I can avoid it. Was the boogie video enabled for this jerk? No, I just uploaded the wrong video. See, the OBS preview looked fine, so I was like, oh yeah, this is kind of like what I recorded for the pokey video, let's just upload it. And then it wasn't. There are some things that are kind of like minigames in this game, but they don't work like they do in Lost Empire. Like the duel with the Boshi is definitely kind of a minigame, but it's not that you unlock it, it's just in the game. Did I get a Nuts? What is a Nuts? I want some kind of stairs here that lets you just go up here. Backup system. I just backup all important files on Git, cause I work with N64, all my files are below 100 megabytes, so it's fine. I don't know if I can do this.     Yeah, I even backup my 3D models on Git, so we're all good. What's a smooth way to add a staircase here? Made a Unigashim using a bad PS1 shader? True, true. Is that what they did in Friday Night Funko? Why are you bringing this up? Get apps from Microsoft, Bill Gates has all your files. No! Wait, I thought GitHub was made... Actually, no, nevermind. I'm good. Rip. Bill Gates has the data on me. He won't give me the Vulk, let's see. Will that make me Vulk or will that cure me from being Vulk? Which one is it? He will become Vulk. But if it's the Vulk vaccine, shouldn't that prevent me from getting Vulk? Usually vaccines are preventing the thing they're named after. The anti-Vulk vaccine? So I can't become anti-Vulk? But then I still won't be Vulk. I will just not be anti-Vulk. I just won't make those Ben Shapiro owns the lips compilation 17 videos. Do you have any tips on how to program for the system? Like, recommend a tool or something?    For the N64, you should just go look around the homebrew dev community. They have a lot of resources. I don't know if it does, the handbrake doesn't break your hand either. That's true. What about... Oh wait, I had the plant pot idea. Yes, we can just have a spinny plant here. Let me do that. By Kelvins? Who's that?  I don't know. Hello Tumbleweed. I was seeing so many YouTube comments today. Are you all watching on YouTube? Are you here from watching the newest video? Is that what made you come here? Is my marketing ploy working? For me, Mario Kart Wii will always be my favorite. Just because I like the online mode that much. Also, I like the wheelies a lot. The wheelies give you something to do on those boring long pieces of nothing track. You came here from the last video? Dang. You are getting funneled into the case pipeline. You are now doomed to watch 50 case clip shorts. Hello Berserker. That's all. Berserker gldfx part? Maybe. I'm still on, I think, 3.6. Did I not properly make this part of the thing? Goddammit. Actually, this plant would work out really well if it had enough space to breathe. Hello, ZeroVolt. This is weird. 750 and 750. I just need to... It seems completely off. What is my mistake here? This should work. What's happening? Since you go through a blockout phase of some sort when doing a level design, this is the blockout phase. We're kinda blocking out the level here and figuring out how the jump should work. And then after that we're actually 3D modeling this. These are basic primitives. I'm not really actually acquainted. Maybe that is the right word. We spoke in maybe a total of like 5 or 6 sentences to each other. Start from the finish level and be constructed until you have nothing. Oh, you mean collision mapping? Yeah, we do that. Hey, where did you get that beanie? I got it from Zeina, but she had to give it to me because she fucked up my haircut. I can't show you guys what my hair looks like. You will never think of me the same. Show please, I can't. Well, accept me for who I am, but I don't want to be a guy with a fucked up haircut. How much to show hair? What would be an appropriate donation incentive? I promise you, it is the stupidest haircut you've ever seen. $690 sounds fair, yeah. We won't judge, you will judge. Thank you for the ship. Okay, you know what? For the sap, I'll move it slightly. Every sap, I'll move it a slight bit more. How's that? That's the best offer I'm going to give you. It's all part of my ploy, Christian. And Bits move it back down. Mad thinks it's so awful, that it's just going to assault his eyes. And he just wants to make sure he's never have to look at it. I fucked up, we got a combo. Yep, that's basically what happened. Hello, innovator. I bet it looks as bad as always, no need to feel ashamed. True. Good point. You know what? I'm putting a cool spiral staircase here. Think enough? No. His name was Freakazee and instead of hacking, he gave me a dog. But Freakazee is good food. Nope. At least I'm going to monetize my misfortune. Every sap, I'll move it slightly back. That's the best deal you're going to get. Freakazee is a thing, yeah, but you spell it different. I move it slightly back. You still can't see any hair. No, I just look like I have a giant forehead. Starting to look like Frieza with this. No, I don't. It would be cool, but I would have to add that to my... Oh no, I have to move it even further back. Wait, did someone gift saps or something? Oh no. Oh no, you can kind of see it. Five saps. Fuck. Okay, here you go. My fucked up haircut. You see that? There's just the fucking bald line here. From this side, I look almost normal. And then here, it's just... Oh my god. Just a huge bald spot. People are laughing at me. Is it that bad? Let me see if I... Yep. Yeah, it is as bad. It was even worse the day it happened. What the fuck happened? Basically, Zana slipped with the hair clippers and just put a bald spot there. Hello, Dranox. That is pretty bad.  I almost got an emo cutout. You know what? At that point, I should have just gone for the mohawk. My eyes! Get well soon, wow. Just go fully bald? Yeah, honestly, that would look less weird than what I have right now. Oops, wrong hit card with the lights off. You know what? With the lights off it wouldn't even have turned out that bad. Just... The fucking cat clipper thing fell off and she just kept going. I have been bald before. There are some streams of me just being bald. If you are lucky, they are still there. I was like, man, summer is too warm. I'm just gonna go bald. Have you ever thought about long hair? I had long hair for a bit and I hated it. I will not put myself in Mario 64. I'll leave that to Brodude. Long hair sucks, I might have exactly bio-biked. It's so impractical. And then when you're riding a bike and it gets in your face. It sucks. Same thing happened to a friend of mine when his girlfriend cut his hair. It looked funny. The first time I saw it, the best thing is he tried to fix it a few weeks later and messed it up again. Great. You don't ride bikes? What are you talking about? Yeah, but when I had long hair, I used to ride my bike everywhere. That was my only way of getting around. So that was really annoying because it would just get in my eyes and be annoying. Oh, like doing push-ups with long hair also sucks. Everything sucks if you have long hair. Ponytail? No. Why don't you just cut it off? You also drive fast out of the shower. That's another advantage. Oh, that also sounds awful bio-bike. No hair is optimal?  I still don't understand why sprinters at like the Olympics don't go bald. Wouldn't that reduce your wind resistance? Your air resistance? It just sounds like a good idea to go bald. Wait, how does Usain Bolt look like? Huh? Honestly, kind of proving my point. Maybe he is good because he is bald. Jenny looked like the haircut made it look like your head. Don't they just use rubber hats? Oh, but that's extra weight you have to carry. Just cut your ears off for max aerodynamics. That might actually work. Honestly, if you are a runner and you haven't cut off your ears yet, you're just not dedicated enough to your craft. I said it. Cut your hands off? I don't know if that's a good idea. Swimmers wear their hats? Dang. Remove his pinky toe to climb a specific wall? What the fuck? Do you even have ears? Yes, they are under the hat. I don't think he has. Okay, so we want a vine section here and we want a normal platforming section here. I'm just thinking where the vine section should start. I don't know if you play a real game like Fortnite. True. Honestly, I do sometimes play Fortnite. In fact, I am a professional Fortnite player. I am being paid to play Fortnite sometimes. And years from breakfast. They pay me. I'm a professional video game player and there's nothing you can say about that because it is factually true. Okay, Tenacious. Oh, you asked something about Blender. Well, just watch and then you learn. Right, it's not that difficult. Just do it and it will work out or not. And then you learn what to do and what not to do. Hmm. I would never make a 64-bit asset because games, especially 3D platformers, without an analog stick are completely unplayable. These are going to be some roots with some leaves on it. I just have them here in the block out as a reference for myself later. Hmm. Right, I said three times to get an answer. Yeah, but usually when sometimes, sometimes you just don't want to answer because it's like a question that there's no good answer for or something where you just think you should learn it by yourself. Hmm. One of N64 and a mouse and keyboard. Surely it's possible to support it. I mean, there's so many analog values. You can probably fit a bunch of keys in there. Just need like an interpreter for that on hardware. Hmm. Probably. I mean, you can do some stuff. You can send ROMs to the USB port and you can print to your comment line with it. So surely there's the interface in and out. So of course it would somewhat work. The question is if the latency is low enough. Also, if the bandwidth is good enough. Probably is. Hmm. You recommend the Blender tutorial? Yeah, the Blender documentation, the official one on the website. Just use that. All the tutorials people make on Blender are just a less efficient way to just reading their documentation. What you do or how I learned Blender is I opened the documentation on page one. And then I just tried every hotkey I talked about. And then I could use Blender. And I think that is the peak way of learning it. Hmm. Only to stop being useful after 2.8. Okay, to be fair, I used 2.79 to learn. So that's like just the version before. That's the nerdiest shit you ever heard. Dang. Oof. Some people learn better using a dark visual representation rather than reading block files. But it has visuals and you can test the hotkeys by yourself right in your Blender viewport. You just have to open a window and blend on the other one. And then every hotkey you see, you just try it. And now it's in your brain. Now it's in there. No one can take it away from you. You've used the hotkey. Maybe even like make a garden or something. And every hotkey you learn, you're like, hmm, how can I use this to improve my garden? I'm 3D modeling here. For me, the hotkeys are the easiest ones to learn. It's all the stuff like the inner workings that I just didn't want to learn. Do you use QWERTZ or QWERTY? I use the QWERTY keyboard, but in the registry I swap the Y and Z button. Do you want to take anything in your room and try to model it? Yeah, that works too. I was suggesting a garden, because there's a lot of creativity that you can use. And when you find hotkeys and use the creativity to make use of the hotkeys, it like wires something in your brain and it feels really good too. What are the hotkeys when you want to cast praise and type in what you want to do? First of all, you need to learn what you can do in the first place. And while you're doing it, you might as well learn the hotkeys. For example, I don't know what the functions I'm doing do. I don't know what they're called, but I can do them. If I wanted to UV map this, I could just do right-click, UF enter, CTRL L, UF enter. UL enter, CTRL L, UF enter, right? And now it's UV mapped like this. And I have no idea what I just did. I have no idea what this is called, but I did it. I also have the thing where I don't know what the buttons I'm pressing are. Like for changing your snapping, I know this is like the movement that I do, but I don't know what button I just pressed. It just becomes automatic and that's what you want, I think. Greatest thing to be done on the N64? Well, it's storing complete. It's probably just gonna not be very fast. Can you explain the latest video on Keynes Clips? I uploaded the wrong clip. Yeah, it's somehow that video is getting a lot of views. I don't know why. The video called HD Pokey, where there's no HD Pokey in the video, it's just Mario standing on a wheel spinning, is one of my most viewed clips ever. Dude, I hate Biobak snapping. It feels so uncontrollable. I think I'm gonna move this down and make this another staircase here. Like so. So there's more spiral staircase vibes to it. That is true, it just gets up snapping. You clickbaited- Oh, so I got a shit ton of view time and that's why it was recommended to a bunch of people. That wouldn't make sense. Maybe then this one happened. But is that clickbait though? Is HD Pokey a clickbait? Because who's getting clickbaited by then, right? No one. I don't know. I really should get rid of this climb. How's it been? Pretty well. I'm making good progress on the games. I think they were just really, really desperate to see the Pokey. I think this would look good if there were just staircases both ways. So let's do 750 by 160 by 1171. That's a bit... That's a bit far. Man. Maybe this one here. Maybe we'll just do that. That should be fine. Okay. Don't forgive me for the Pokey. Okay, fine. I will show you guys the Pokey. Let me just set up the debug level.  Slow. Woodyard. We are about to see the Pokey. That's not the Pokey. Wrong level. Programmers should pay the gamers for playing the games and stuff the other way around. What? There's the Pokey. Can you see him? Do you guys forgive me now? He's right here. Yeah, you're right, Tiberius. I just really gotta fix that. Okay. He kicked his head off. That's a bit out of line still. Just a shitty texture, I think. Did you know that the Isle of Fino just runs on N64? This is the craziest thing. Let me show you. I forgot about this. We never needed the Gamecube. Ball minus the Z fighting. The Z fighting is fixable, though. And look at the staircase here. Oh my god. The framerate is good, though. Isn't it bannable to show Twitch chat on any other platforms? No. Yep, that's Sunshine N64. Yeah, game. It's not bannable, trust me. Should we make an April Fools game where it's a fake fighting game and it's just different graphing arrows and Z-Fighting? I was thinking a really good April Fools game would be a game where you just play with technical difficulties for like half an hour by making a game that has so many technical difficulties that you can barely get into the game and then the second you actually get into the game, you just win. I think that would be insane. That would go hard. Well, ideally the player wouldn't even know that the whole game is just technical difficulties, I Think that would be something people would get either really mad at or would think is really funny. Should post RTY and try not to say download link in the description and put a break in link and turn off the screen. Dude, that's too mean. That's too much, I can't do that. I kind of did that with the last version of the game. Oh my god, do you know what I did with Lost Impact? I did an April Fools demo release on Lost Impact and the game would just be like an intro cutscene and then it would turn into a picture of Jim Carrey and like it would just get stuck on the picture of Jim Carrey. Who uploaded Pokemon in Jump Stent? Someone like that forever playing my Jim Carrey mod. Yamada's only mad in the last three hours. Hotamata receives the best san poem.    With a hint of love.   We need a new OST. Super Paper Mario. Super Paper Mario. There we go. Oh god, are there going to be a bunch of RGYI demos leaking too? Probably. Um, that looks like shit. Oh, honestly, this would be fine as a vime. I think. Hello, Divas. Okay, is he looking good again? Really? Have you... Oh, you haven't been here for the hair reveal. You wouldn't say that I'm looking good if you had been here for the hair reveal. It's not what's on the outside. Do you think that's a cope? Kirito looks maxing. Would you call people saying that? Would you tell them that they're coping? I think so. Why are you hiding that new haircut? It might not be that amazing of a haircut. All right, let's see if this is fun. Okay, so I'm kind of late to the romhacking party. Last time I played Mario 64 was the best one. Which romhack are must-haves to have played? Nipsey. Well, I mean, the most must-have played one is probably Star Roads University. But I imagine you already played Star Roads and you said you like 74 better. So from that we can deduce you like games where it's just movement. So maybe you would like 64 Land. Or some of the Brody Tags. They released decades after recently, which a lot of people seem to like. Maybe they would look a bit better darker green? Yes, maybe. I just wanted them to stand out for now. We haven't thought about the visuals for this area at all. As you can see, none of these visuals here fit together yet. And nothing's UV-mapped. Right now we just want the platforming to be fun. And then we can think about the visuals. What the fuck? Oh, I gave them collision. No! We might just have to trust that it works well enough. Yeah, the vines definitely do stand out somehow. It doesn't have to be by them being darker. It could be by them being a different color. But yeah. Right now that's all that's missing in this area is the Yoshigod statue. And that red coin. We want a whole platforming playground over there. Dang, we have a lot of Cursed Mirror fans in chat. I didn't know Cursed Mirror was that popular. But that's good. Cursed Mirror is more the direction of the sec here. Than the direction of Decade's After or Serene Fusion, I would say. And we have some fog. We could add some fog here, yeah. It could be pretty dark fog. If anything, I can play with that. I have not ported back my enhancements to the original R64. And unfortunately, I also don't give out any Patreon bonuses. Because that might get me in legal trouble with Nintendo. So I stay away from that. I am releasing a new mod soon that will run really well on N64. In fact, most of the game is 60fps on N64. It releases as soon as SimpleFlips has played the game for his competition. So you can play that one, I would think. I've beaten it a few times on N64 with no issues. The hack name is so long, though, that I do not remember what the hack was called. I just know it's really, really long. I think it was called something like That Time I Became Friends With The Royal Scuttlebuck Family And Fell From Space. I think that was the name. Let's just make up some random geometry here. I will not get first in the comp. The first place in the comp will go to someone who makes a 30-minute game. Even the rule says you need to make a 50-minute game. 10-minute game, something like that. You never win the comps by following the rules. What's next, F3? I don't know if I can host F3 this year. Because I'm gonna have a child coming out around the same time as F3 would usually be happening. So it's a little tight time-wise for me. Hmm. Depending on this fuck technique. What the fuck is this? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did they just add a fucking semi-transparent mesh that follows you around? Is this a million semi-transparent meshes around the entire level? Oh my god. You know what? I guess it works for PC port. What the fuck? Hey, it's the closest you're gonna get to ProPixelFork. What the fuck? Yeah, there's definitely a real implementation here on shader level instead of just doing 3D geometry. But it is PC port, so you might be pretty limited, right? I know that they have to work with Lua scripts. So it might actually be just like a creative way of doing it. Should I do a react to the new Palantir video? I think that could be fun. All right, I might do a react, but I'm not gonna do it live on stream. I'm gonna do it off stream sometime. I'm gonna just update the emulation. What I'm doing.   Dude, that's a fake podcast like on TikTok. Oh, wait. How do we do a fake podcast? I'm up for this idea. I just need to know how I can do that. How long is this Palantir video? Oh, it's live. We don't know. I think it's gonna be like an hour long, right? How would you build skills to just hack Mario? Honestly, the easiest way to learn coding is to just start coding. And then you just look up whatever you don't know. Coding is pretty nice in that you can understand what most code does just by looking at it. It's made to be as understandable as possible. That's fair play, man. Bye, cat. You don't need documentation to understand codes. Most code is written to be very self-explanatory. See ya, Zef. Maybe they didn't manage to ice. Isolate the speech bubble from the rest of the sound. That would be my guess. I don't place bubbles near anything or have access to them. Just ignore the RNA一樣白ある文字設定  Let's see what happens when I replace them Expand options so then i'm not sure what you guys are talking about oh you guys are talking about lego islands the fortnite thing so if you want you can use this to just jump up here right away with some more kicks i kind of like that so you don't have to take all the detour here i'm gonna have a daughter named lila jr and teach her how to sneak kill aren't you scared she's gonna kill you aren't you scared that lila jr is gonna tell how to sneak kill and like criticize every little thing true it's mario 74 music how did that get in here six months shouldn't be just a little progressor it should be a lot of progressor still don't know what you're talking about hello spaghetto the day where you can play this game will one day come unless someone murders me if someone murders me it was a nintendo employee just so you know just so they don't try anything i'm already blaming them for my death and we're using fast 64 for that divas it is a blender extension that exports f3d so did hair cat is an attempt on my life you hear that zaina that's how much you fucked me up do what you're doing your mom cry about it i'm gone i'm through do the thing of yanina is her name the very level i don't want to think about it i remember watching games when we did decompiler fly a little bit down did i do a video about that  hello zelda  what's up with that hood and someone made an attempt on my life and now my hair looks weird so i'm wearing a hoodie do and isn't based on baldness what about Zeina will do this if you don't have pretty hair well i'm not bald though my hair looks stupid to them bald also yes i would not care about being bald in fact i want to be bald but zaina's not letting me hello bumps so would you go bald without Zeina by your side maybe probably not so this is doing the next anime haircut before it becomes popular would i let Zeina go bald no that would look awful but that's double standards case yeah so what cry about it what you're gonna do now huh yes Zeina cannot have short hair i don't like short hair so all right let's give this a try my hair is thick i lose a lot while showering and it's still thick so interesting but i mean the opposite of bald is not thick hair right it's long hair what the hell so yes so there you can hold up are you balding early it's so over for Biobak so oh no this is still clipping into this oh but now both sides clip so what if we could slightly rotate this around pivot point here to fix the issue maybe this is better so do  you haven't drank coffee and wait why are you drinking coffee are you underage you're too young to be drinking coffee lila coffee is for big boys you're still a baby well it's not a fucking lawyer i will coffee is not alcoholic i still thought kids are not supposed to drink coffee is that not true okay so moving that side is fine i'm worried about moving from this side to the other side that might suck it wouldn't be so bad to be swimming for a little bit but yeah moving through here from the side would just kind of blow how do we mitigate that maybe some pushing blocks on this side here would work it's not recommended for kids to drink coffee uh-huh maybe that's why lila turned out the way she did so all right let's try this every kid my age is drinking redbull and i will shit on a regular basis yeah actually redbull is very similar to coffee i know when i was underage i only drank redbull once and yeah i think i was awake like half the night there's 270 milligrams of caffeine in a redbull holy shit hello therapist that is what we're trying to do the beanie salon wait paki did you miss the hair reveal we had the hair reveal earlier  why does mario sometimes do this in this area there's some kind of bug here wait that was the better console instruments did you guys hear that wait anyone else hearing the better console info am i literally losing it brain rot i think so too wow the game's very bugged this is probably related to the crash we had outside guy who has only seen better console with the guitar true so so so so so so so so  we'll fix it in the patch ship it so so I've heard people talk about spadesie before but I don't know what that is. Completely unknown to me. Why is this giving you Mario Odyssey sent in a bullet bill somewhere in the northeast area? No one is giving you that area. Huh? You know that sparkly cola-like substance like lemon plus cola? Mezzo Mix? It's Mezzo Mix! Mezzo Mix is a type of spadesie? Oh, okay. This doesn't seem to improve anything at all. This is for sure a solvable issue too. That is annoying. I can probably move it up slightly with no negative consequences. Is there another pathway for this? I don't think that should put you in this level. Oh, you mean the submarine shouldn't put you in this level? Yes, that is true. That is indeed a changed level pathway. Okay, this one is coming out of the wall, which is a bit bad. Are any of the others coming out of the wall? No. Doesn't look like it. Yeah, the submarine brings you to one of the domes, but we changed the level order around so the warp is no longer up to date. Alright, the last thing missing here is the Yoshi God statue. Supposed to be a Yoshi God statue on the other side here, and you have to get over there. We need a good way to get up here first, first of all. I really like him just moving in this area though. It feels nice. Guys, I recently found out hot chocolate is just like cacao, but instead of milk you use water. I always thought hot chocolate was just a synonym for cacao. I never want to drink hot chocolate again. Just give me cacao. You also thought it's the same thing? Yeah, me too, but it's not. It's crazy. Yeah, it's just water with chocolate powder. That's what hot chocolate is. I am German, not Swiss. No, that's what cacao is. Cacao is the real deal, yes. Hot chocolate is just... suck. Using water is horrible. Yeah, they just don't put milk in there, or maybe they put a little bit of milk. That's like a secret sauce. At the expensive places, hot chocolate is just milk. What the hell? Milk is a luxury item now. How the west has fallen. Buying bad hot chocolate is a skill issue? No, it's like Zeina was like, oh, you want a hot chocolate? And then she started pouring water. I was like, water? Why is there water in my hot chocolate? And she said, no, that's how it's always done. And everyone agreed with her. Yeah, I figured it'd be a long video, Kaki. That's why I wanted to do an off-stream reaction, because I didn't want to dedicate a whole hour of my stream to just re-watching Paladins video. What is the song? Fractal appears. I do not remember who Fractal was in Paper Mario. Do we just want a staircase here? It's kind of lame, isn't it? Oh, what if we had these here? The first 30 minutes of this video is just recounting its uncommented floors, walls and ceilings video. Oh. That would kind of make sense, I guess.  We have water geysers. We have that in a different level. Alright, let's check this out one more time and then we can start UV mapping some of this and setting an art style here and stuff like that. Man, the new video is not doing well on click-through rates. That sucks. I think we need a better title here. Have you watched it yet? Yeah. I mean, I think it's a very interesting video. I think it has the potential to do well. It just doesn't seem very clickable. Is it in the 6060 bit? No. This edit here was a bad idea, apparently. Oh, no. I switched to user space. How do I get back? Fucked. Anyone remember the hotkey to get out of here? At least I'm responding to the error. Stay? Hopefully not. Let me check. Blender local view. Numpad slash. There we go. So I think by rotating it like this we are effectively not doing anything. We need the thing to be rotated from the get-go, right? What if I just do this? But that's lame. Is Nintendo really a 64-bit console? How about... But why? Maybe like this? I don't know. Maybe like this? Oh, and why did the N64 have 64 bits? I think they could do a little bit better. We will keep watching the metrics. Only 7.4%. That's really low. Usually it's a lot more. Let's see. Can we filter this by subs and non-subs? It slowly went down over time, too. Well, if it goes above 4.6% then we know the change was good. 64 bits. Nintendo's biggest lie. Oh my god. That's fucking insane. Oh, oh shit. This is an insane title. Watch this go to like 20% critical rate. Oh, that's a good title. That is gonna make such a big difference. Right now it's 7 out of 10. I think that's gonna go to like 3. See, YouTube is all about the angle. For 60k a year I'll be your title guy. 60k a year is a lot. I don't think my YouTube channel makes that much. I don't think my YouTube channel made that much in total. Hello, GF guy. Look, what Nintendo's biggest lie is doesn't matter. What matters is that we have a YouTube title. This is how YouTubers think, by the way. That's how you have to think as a YouTuber. Okay, it looks like it now changed, which is good. Unfortunately it changed for the worse. So I think if we do this it will work now. Wait, this song sounds like that area in Majora's Mask. Nintendo's second biggest lie doesn't matter. True, true. Same channel, significant revenue stream for me. My first YouTube channel, the big one, income this month was around $450. Whether that's big or not, I guess that's a matter of relativity. What is going on? I don't know. Something's definitely wrong with this level. It's causing all these crashes. Second. We have to do these analytics here. I want to see how much Biomex... The fucking level just crashed. It just closed itself. I'm keeping this open here. Yeah, it's just Parallel, it sucks ass. Pretty simple reason. Seems to be in the wrong spot now though. That kinda sucks. But once we fix that, I think it's gonna be good. Yeah, the problem with being serious with Parallel... First of all, half the time you boot it, there's a stupid update. That's annoying. Second, it doesn't go as fast when I press F4. Third, there's a bunch of issues with my ROMEC in Parallel that are not there on N64. So I blame Parallel for that. And then fourth is my fucking controller doesn't work on it. So even if I wanted to, I can't test with it. It's just not a good emulator for me. I think next we want the Yoshigod statue and then we can do some UV mapping. I think we already have some that we can just copy-paste in here. Cool. I use a Gamecube controller. This one right here. When do you use debug tools or accuracy pick one? Yeah, for debug tools I also have a separate emulator. That isn't even released yet, but it's there technically. 1.6 is probably the most used one, if you consider total hours playtime. If you consider users, maybe not. How do you be worried about a bug no one is exploiting? Well, because someone might be exploiting it sometime in the future, you know. I think it's warranted to be worried about that. That doesn't seem that crazy to me. I think I'm going to have to wait for the next update.   I think I'm going to have to wait for the next update. Do you need a praying area in front of the Yoshi statue? Like, at the floor here? Sounds good to me. We can add this praying area. I think we can add this praying area. This would be so much easier if I didn't have to look at the weather. God. There we go.  How's the answer to the hand I'm loading in areas? I see you have all of them in one file, but surely the answer doesn't load them all in one go? It does. There used to be a tool called RoamManager. Actually, it still exists. That loads the areas one by one, which is a lot nicer. But that is made for binary, so we can't use it with decomp. Which is really unfortunate. Because it means we lose a lot of RAM to that. The problem is, if you wanted to load the areas one by one, you need to learn a lot of linker script that I haven't learned yet. Oh god, these are fucked. Alright, we have our praying area here. Now you can pray to the Yoshi gods for a bountiful harvest or something. Alright. And I like how bad it looks. Does that make sense? It does look like an artwork. Like a rock model thing. Alright. Remake the statues as hell? I've seen that with the Bowser statue in OBB. Yep. Wait, have you actually tried to UV map the whole thing? I think... I'm pretty sure I just used some smart UV unwrap thing. I think UV mapping statues would be a lot easier if we had it more segmented. If we just added pieces in there where we can break the UV mapping, like a collar or something. Because if we had a collar here, it would be much easier to just use the smart UV unwrap thing. Alright. Alright, I think this is good base here. What the hell is the combiner on the Bowser statue? Why is it like that? It looked bad at first, so I just changed the combiner around until it looked good. And now it looks like that. It is what it is. It's really mostly just random math that hopefully looks good combined. There's no reason for it other than that. Roblox10 has better UV mapping than Blender? I do not believe you. I think you may just not be very good at Blender UV mapping. You've been moving the statue. Hopefully it's going to be a bit easier because we have so many places that don't have to be continuous. Like the entire backside here. There we go. There we go. There we go. This is very amusing. Why are you wearing a beanie? I am not going to show it. I won't say. It has a good reason, but I will never tell you. A refresh on the analytics. We had 4.3%. We were at 4.2% earlier. I looked at it off stream. I think the title may be doing work. I think marking seams is a pitfall. No, marking seams is very useful. You can use marking seams to have the outer unwrap and then fix only those parts where the seams were marked to stitch them back together. Like right here, what I would do if I cared a lot about the UV mapping here. First of all, I think this makes sense. Right here, you can see how this is going into a singularity. Right here. If you really want to do it, you could mark a seam here. And then stitch them back together afterwards. And that would work a lot better. Or you could even mark a seam along here to just remove the singularity. Like so, is probably what I would do. Right, and now the singularity is gone. And if you stitch them back together, you can make it seamless. Just have to stitch this back together now. Isn't that useful? Where is the stitch here? Yeah, so that's one vertex here, and then the other one is... Is it this one? This one. So these two belong together, meaning I can do that. And then I can just move it down by four copies or something. And now it's technically seamless, although it still doesn't look good. But yeah, you get the idea. Especially useful for like trees. Or tree crowns. So like the reason I want to isolate from the UV map and run from you, it's more back and forth. It's a lot easier if you... But if you mark, if you do the seam thing, then you can figure out where the singularities are. You get more attempts. If you do what you're suggesting, you have to get it right perfectly the first time. Which is obviously not reasonable. Okay. Case, please go to a barber. No, I don't wanna. Oh god, Case. Look, that's not my fault, that's Zaina's fault. She got me this haircut. Either way, I think we have done enough work for today. I'm probably gonna finish this area off stream. And then we're gonna start working on course 13. The Ice Palace. The Mysterious Ice Castle, which we still need a boss for. I still haven't really... Yeah, if you guys wanna brainstorm a boss for the Ice Castle, let me know. And I'll think about it on next Saturday. Either shave it all, or get a proper short haircut, because that looks funky. I'll just let it grow, and then I'll shave it off again, and then I have a boss cut. Yeah, okay. Bye bye, until next time.
