What the hellie? Why is my camera like that? Oh, is that much better? Kinda. Hello, Clayman. Apologies for being two minutes late today. Ghetto case? Ghetto casa? Ghetto? Gebo gebo. Webo webo. Rosa Cooper. Those are not the speakers I wanted. Is it this? Tom Clancy Rainbow Six OST? Okay. Is Tom Clancy part of the game? It's a Playstation game? I thought this was like a modern game. Maxstern, I can't hear you. Okay. Hello, Tiny Man. It's going well. Speaker settings must be changed. How? Can you guys... You guys can hear me? Good old NVIDIA Broadcast, I guess. Sorry that analog 3D underperformed your game. I forgive you. Yo, this person wants to buy shrimps off me. Okay. You guys need to get into the shrimp farming side business. Very good income for very little work. I will be honest. Sometimes I nod and come back to watch the gameplay bits. Don't blame me. I see. That's okay. Hello, MinusMario8573. What's the 8573 standing for? Or is it 8573? Don't dox yourself, kid. It's random numbers to make my username cooler. Oh, I see. Made me laugh, the person on your analog. And you're saying they have their earplugs all the way up and still can't hear you. Earplugs sound. I see, I see. Hello, Riolu. Thank you for the Prime money. 42 months, dude. That's like... That's like free babies. That's free babies of subscriptions. Oh, Lee. Bro's been here since day... Like 1400. He make a Mario 64. You applied for partner on Twitch? Yes, but they rejected it every time and then I stopped trying. I don't want to apply for partner on Twitch again because... What if they... Nevermind, I'm not saying anything. What if they ban me? What if they ban me? For breaking the rules. I kind of like that I can just break the rules on Twitch right now, you know what I mean? It's because Twitch is kind of poopy. And I hope YouTube streaming gets better soon, but it's also kind of poopy. 42 months is three and a half years. Yes! That's just over free babies. Or four babies. Is that not what I said? What's a good streaming site then? Good question, I don't know. Which in 2020 was a good streaming site. Go to Strike.com Slash Jerkin I wonder if kick is any better actually. I feel like it has to be, right? Just because Twitch is so bad. I think... Wait, 6a? 6a is used twice. We can't have that. Let's fix the 6a thing. Let's fix the 6a thing. Yeah. Is it also very gambling adjacent? I guess that's the problem. Like they want you to be like, oh no. If you go to kick, that's where all the bad streamers are. Just an observation. I don't know. Problem. I don't literally gamble. Well, hello Nintendo for life. YouTube and Twitch at the same time. Because I don't really want to care about the platform I stream on. I don't want to give Twitch special attention. Good afternoon, random waffle. I'm a waffle. You can just go into the city. The train I take to get there every once in a while. There was this kid who would take the train with me. So he was Cleveland Brown from Family Guy. That's crazy. Who went to school with Family Guy? So you guys don't notice but off stream I pretty much finished the overworld. It's basically all done. We're now just decorating it and doing optional sidequests. You're going to give his fair share to the devs of VS Code? What do you mean with fair share? Hello Samuel. I'm just getting this finished. From my side we're approaching 100%. I would say 95-96% is done. But there is still a lot of biobank reworks. I expect to get done with all the V1 of all the content probably by July. Or June maybe. I don't know how much time I find. I'm not throwing biobank under the bus. Biobank has a lot of work. There's nothing we can do about that. And we do want to just take the optional graphic fidelity increase. Let's see. This won't go down until around here I would say. 4000 coordinates with 140 stars. You can handle several winning cards when you see the Nomaru movie. That would be funny. You guys wanna see some cool shit I did off-stream? You know what? You can see it in tomorrow's case clips. Too bad. That's true. I'm the voice actor for Yoshi. What character do you think I could voice act? Like in a TV show? I don't know. I'm not sure. What character do you think I could voice act? Like in a TV show? Realistically, what personality would my character have? Gas station clerk? Come on man! Moe from The Simpsons? My voice that ugly? Holy shit. This is going way too fast for 76 stars. Wow. Did I even show this thing here? Look how cool that is. The preview to the level. And this is the Yoshi hotel you rebuild with money. I really like this. The way this is programmed now, every time you get a star, this goes further and further down. So Bozo is making progress in drilling as you progress through the game. I put it to 85. I thought it was 100. Yeah. Hmm. Alright, we got that drill. Now we can make another drill. And this drill is going to be here. And this drill is going to slowly appear. I think I want to just use this as a reference. Not a realistic villain. Too low. Yeah. Is it? No. 0x33. What did I type in? 0x70. Oh yeah. Let's make this into 14 separate levels. And then all 14 levels will be loaded separately. And then I will try to make this seamless. We will also try to make this so that this is all using one RAM segment for all the actors. So that we don't need to reload segment 6 over and over. So that will be a little bit of work. Probably could have done that from the get-go to save a little bit of work. But it's fine, I think. I think we're going to do fine. Can you make an egg? I've never tried to lay one. Do you think that somewhere hidden deeper than our genetic code, the ability to make eggs still exists? Maybe like make a little carved-up egg. Hello Polarus. Hello Polarus. Is that Adventure Gazette as we see it right now? Yes. I knew this was coming a while ago because Weissker told me about it. I have inside connections, I'm kind of a big deal. I don't really know. I don't really know. I don't understand about that because we haven't played Banjo-Kazooie yet. Play the original first. I don't know. Okay. So it's going to be 115. We have to divide by 115. I'm going to come from roughly here. 240 divided by 115. Hello. Hello, MZXRules. I know this person. You're a Zelda hacker. The question, maybe it's off-taking. What do you think of DBS returning? I am very looking forward to DBS returning. I hope they remake the Dragon Ball Super and make it not stupid as fuck. That would be so cool. I'm sad that I couldn't judge the Zelda competition, but I was just so busy. I have no idea. Possibly. I have hope that it's not dumb as hell. They said they were going to remake it, right? No, no, no, no. I don't care about the animation. The animation is whatever. The animation is like 10% for me. The story and the characters and the actions, that's like 90% for me. And that was awful at Dragon Ball Super. Shit made no sense. Every character was as strong as they needed to be in every scene with no regard for internal consistency or anything. And I know maybe it's cheap or maybe it appears stupid to care about oh, I care that it makes sense, not that it tells a good story arc and character arc, but there's just a point where it makes so little sense that you cannot suspend your disbelief anymore. And you just can't turn it off anymore You just can't turn it off anymore at that point because it's just too stupid. Interesting. So that level crashes. Don't need to go into it to get here. Right, it would be destroyed at this point. So, let's just change it. This is what it should look like when you have every star in the game. Ah, I see, green stash. That does sound annoying. Oh, okay. Okay. I have some issues with this. This might not be possible to fix. I know it sounds stupid, but this might not be possible to fix. Neat colors. Where? In the overworld? The overworld looks like shit. You wanna see a cool looking level? Let me show you a cool looking level. This is neat colors. Oh, how fucking cool does this look? And it runs on N64. Can you believe it? Look at this. Wait. Okay, well, the level is a little bit buggy right now. That happens when you keep rewriting the engine. Crash screen. Oh. God damn it. You're using this one too? No. Hello, roadkill girl. Um. What the fuck? Being extremely unstable right now. The thing actually is that we ran out of RAM in the overworld. So that probably is causing some of these instabilities. Aw. All I did was change the face angle to 0, right? How's that doing this? Oh my god, I'm gonna lose it. I don't know if you're weak or not. Yeah, looking at the drill just seems to crash the game. Or maybe not. Okay, that's the pitch angle. I will also try roll, but I suspect roll will not work either. This is a shitty situation to be in. Oh my god. How's this happening? Yeah, okay. I probably need to rotate the drill 90 degrees in the model and then it should work. Like so. And then this is rotated on the wrong axis. So... I think I rotated this on the wrong axis. So... Let's see how this works out. It would have to be this. Wait, and then this would have to be 0. This would have to be 0 too. Okay. Maybe that's how it works. Can you use companions? Yes. Sometimes. Depends on where. Okay, well it rotates around that axis now, but it is rotated wrong in the overworld. What about the other one? Lose it. And the worst part is it's all my own fault. Probably. Okay, that's bizarre. This one's rotating around the right axis and this one isn't. Let's get this right first then. Okay. What the fuck does mainline mean? You have an answer to that question? I cannot answer your question. Okay. Maybe I do need to rotate the other way around. This part always sucks if you need to rotate around something that is not the yaw axis. It is just painful. Is it supposed to be wheels? Yes. I don't care about the A3D right here, so it doesn't matter to me. Okay. I think this has potential now. I need to be more careful with my wrist. Let me just use this hand here. Ugh. There we go. Okay. Now we have it rotated and it rotates around this axis. That's the roll axis. Alright. Then we just need to make sure that we just rotate the red one here. I think this right now will just rotate around the pitch axis. It will just rotate flat in space. But I want to take a look anyway. It's spinning backwards. That's an easy fix. That's not a worry. It's just because 3D engines might rotate pitch, yaw and then roll. Or they might rotate roll, pitch and then yaw. It's a little difficult to just know. Okay, nice. They go the right way around, but as we suspected, it is no longer tilted. Which should now be easy to achieve by just going maybe 1, 0, 0. As soon as accurate and quantizing I4 of our two colors people are together. I would say both. Hello, ladies matey. That's not the level I wanted to be in. Colors are always blurred into each other if they're right next to each other on a texture. It's weird. I can look at the drill, but not immediately in this level. I'm not sure I understand what's going on here. Alright, so close. Going the wrong way around, and then obviously some of the drills are going the wrong way. So we'll do it this way. And then we need camera 3. Both of them should have a camera shake. It's the parameters again. Falloff range and falloff start. Hello, Neil. No camera shake here. There should be camera shake around here. Maybe the range is too small. Did I put this in the edit function? No. Is the small shake just too small? I definitely have camera shake here. Okay. Falloff too large. Okay. Okay, I see. Needs to be maybe 3600 here. Oh, 8000 is perfect. Okay, nice. And then the falloff can be 2000. Now we need a sound. Is there a sound in Mario 64 we could use for this? Something that's like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Like, maybe the the elevator? Groaning? Groaning? Where did we use this? Bonsai Code, Bonsai Build, let's see. Bullet Cart, maybe not. 07, don't know what that is. Elevator. Elevator. I think the elevators might work. Will he fall into lava? It's like a continuous sound. No way. No way. What's metal scrape? Sounds like a big fat metal box rotating on ground. Let's see. Interesting. I use it somewhere. Interesting. I think we have a nice sound now. Will you update your banner to say, create a return to your island if it becomes more popular than Lost Impact? It will definitely become more popular than Lost Impact. I didn't even know my banner said that. The truth is, I don't pay attention to my Twitch banner. A good chance I will not. Why did it crash again? There's just a place I can't look at here. So close. I got so close to seeing it. I need to figure out what's causing the crash. What the hell? Okay. Posa is definitely drilling into this. We need some dirt spawns here too. But not before the crash is fixed because it's going to drive me crazy. I'm going to put that on my to-do list. What else is missing? Oh, we didn't finish the sand bomb? Oh, the volcano erupting also. Let's do the big to-do list first. Everything past part 1, please. The next thing is the credits scene of the Rainbow Brother. We're not working on the credits yet. Make the lighthouse play the Pirate Bay song by DoopMate if that song is still doing it. We don't have that song imported yet, so we can't do that. Yoshi's not spawning onto Posa 2. I have that. I'm not sure on the text for the Yoshi's here yet. Let me go here. We have this area here with a bunch of Yoshi's. They talk to you and they give most of the Yoshi's text, but there's 4 Yoshi's I haven't given a text yet. I think it makes sense to delay giving them a text until we have more side-levels in, because they might be able to give you valuable hints. Yoshi's Stadium. Okay, we're not doing the side-levels yet. We're going to the MCO to finish this because the casino we're taking off needs Yoshi and model moving. We have that already, actually. We just need the new model. So this one gets a plus. Make 2 or 3 Yoshi's, then don't spawn onto Posa 2. It's beaten. Maybe the melon one. Fruit juice bar. Hello, Siak. Yeah, there just aren't really any Yoshi's here. And for the fruit juice bar we need Reina. So let's add some Yoshi unassigned here that will be assigned later. Then you can have texts that appear later, similar to the other stuff here. 3 Yoshi's, why not. They released a new analog video upgrade yesterday, I think. And it does fix some issues. They have the boot time, which is good. This is done. Nice. Okay, we can't do this yet. Because we don't have to build them. Okay, we have pass 1 of the overworld. Done. Officially. And now we're doing some decorating with animals. Let me walk through the overworld. After I delete the wallcrap here. It is very nice. It feels so good to be done with the first part. You have no idea. And now we're decorating it with animals. I want butterflies, I want birds, I want crabs. Butterflies, birds, crabs, spiders, I don't think we have any other little critters. New invocation here. We should just walk through the entire overworld once. See how it feels. And this is where the overworld starts. Although there is... Well, you cannot spawn over here. We got the sand plumb. They found me, my beautiful cuboid form. It's 59. I'm going to make a new one. Swift and efficient, I'm sure you'll be excellent in the beaches. Thank you. I forgot if there was a stingray. There is a stingray. They take you to secret levels. I think there's two of them. The Yoshi! You need to attach to the Yoshis. Oh, seagulls too! Of course! There was something else I just had that's missing. Cheep cheep! What about the skybox? We don't really have a skybox yet. This is just a temporary thing. Probably should be making one. Will we play outside bounds? Why? It's the crab. The crab got out of bounds somehow. How did he do that? Is there just a crab that spawned under the ground? No. There has to be one that spawned underground. How did I manage that? Aha! Look at them! Wait, nevermind. There's a bunch of them. Nevermind, he was underground. Nevermind, he was underground. That's probably what happened. Okay. Okay. Let's do another walkthrough. Hello BB, Mario. What if this guy was going to change the direction of the game? Like, it starts off in the day, but in the middle of the game it's sunset, but in the end it's night time. The problem with that is we need to change all the vertex colors all over the entire island. Oh yeah! Mr. Krabs! It would have worked had we gone in with the idea that we would do that from the get-go, but we did not. Like, we would have multiplied everything by nth color, but that would have been so oppressive on the combiner that I'm not sure we would want to do that anyway. Thank you for the money! No I.O. before bed! The wood paneling behind me? Yes, I'm in the wood dimension. I was locked into the basement and Zena said I will not let you out until R.T.Y.I. is done. She's just throwing me like scraps of food. Usually it's like chicken bones with a little bit of meat left on it. I have to chew on it. Like a dog. You know where I sleep? I sleep on the bench. And I don't get a blanket either. I have to pick up little pieces of clothing that fell off of other things. And then I sleep under that. Okay, that's a bug. What the fuck? And the crab still fell out of bounds. The other one is at least 0x79. Should we just use this model ID somewhere? There you go. Well, they're probably both easy to fix. I just need to figure it out once. So I can't be using 0x79. Let's use 0x32. I need to fix all the behavior names real quick. ... Easy fix. The stars will now work. Let's double check your origins on that one. What for? With all the actors renamed, this one should be easy. No movement. No movement. Slide down movement. No movement. Slide down movement. Aha! This one moved up by 12 coordinates. No movement. No movement. I'm not confident that moving one of them up by 12 coordinates would fix the bug. Working on Zelda for the Atari 2600. That sounds cool as hell. Who pinged me? My video editor! ... My next video is coming along nicely. Eppenhund master. My dad used to call them pig dogs. The chain chomps. Okay, the star model is fixed. Let's keep exploring the overworld. Okay, we already have some butterflies here. Very nice. That's cool as hell. ... This overworld is a lot bigger than it is in Diddy Kong Racing. Okay, that guy needs a text still. Hello, Biobank. Biobank, we just finished the first iteration. We're going over and doing decorating. But before we do that, I wanna just run over the entire overworld once. ... That breaks the immersion that this is all one continuous world. Yay! ... Yeah, those exclamation marks with the Yoshis. That's kind of really bothering me right now. It's an old sign! The Yoshi's haven't changed it yet. But yeah, I plan to update that still. Oh, you're making me go all the way over there? You're kind of an asshole for that. I don't like that. I'm changing that. ... ... Oh my god, the fact that you need the ice cap to do this is so cool! I love this! ... ... ... Overworld part 4, crystals have a crash. Dude, this emulator is so good. You can just do this. Look at that, and it just tells you what crashes. It's LWC 1F22 0x108S0 That explains everything. It's... Oh, OBJ field. It's target OBJ 0. ... ... Nice target OBJ 0. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... What about movie bar on the beach? There's one somewhere else. Hello, Kevachten. This Mario has around 16 different custom idle animations, so you're gonna have to pot a lot of them. ... ... ... There's a whole, like, idle animation system. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... You little asshole. Also the floor thing. Certainly a bug we need to fix. No problem though. It's not really it. Oh and it doesn't end the cutscene either. Oh that's a problem. That should do it. You don't need to know any C. C is free. You are born with C. You came free with your having a brain on earth. Oh no! He noticed I loaded the same stage! Don't do the crap in the timeline. Such an attack is not fine. Thank you Yoshi. Definitely something very wrong with the dialogue. Let's see. It's probably because he doesn't have a height. Yeah. Actually I just need certain effects. It actually gets the size of the cutscene height from the hitbox, so that's why we need that. Why would you buy the Geneva Convention? Because you're safestating. You're scum. That works. Cool. Did it say Link Mario over the rainbow? It did say that. Hello, Charvin. Would you say that Yoshi is a human? The Geneva Convention can be very annoying, frankly, if you need to use it for your testing. He shows up very rarely. That's honestly pretty much the first thing I've ever seen him in testing. I'm pretty sure it will be the biggest one in terms of Mario 64 community, yes. I would argue it already is, just because my channel is so big. Did Yoshi show up once per savepoint game? Would that be less cringe? I know what you mean with cringe. The Geneva Convention is very random. Have you guys... I don't know if this is real, but I saw the Elon Musk Girls for the win. That's the most reddit thing of all time. I think that one's fixed. Dude, no one's gonna make a mini version of R.T.Y.I., because no one will know how to do it. It was easy for other romhacks, because I made the patch for them. There's a patch I made that makes Mario small. It makes him like 25% the size. And he also moves much slower. Or his jumps are much weaker. So that's a way to make a romhack very harder. Yeah, how did you know? Play Metal Garden, I worked hard on it. Oh, Yoshi is only here when the boss is about to come. Very beautiful game, true. Look at this beautiful block. The Yoshi that hatches need to be a baby Yoshi. Cobblers. Alright, now we're in the second half of the overworld. Okay, I broke all the walls here, that's cool. It feels so cool to just be able to run through the overworld now. I know how I broke the walls. It's because I merged my distance and there were decals. It's fine, Biobank would remake my work anyway. I have played Yoshi's Island as a small little bubble. Yes, fuck. Yes, fuck. I need to fix that. Yes, fuck. Yes, fuck. I'm so sick of this music. This music sucks. I can't listen to literally anything else. Nice, silence. I like his little dice he has, because he's like an arcade wiggler. He makes you play arcade games. Look at his body change color, it's because I was using ENV. I think he is very cool. Look at him. Let's listen to the Yoshi's Island OST. Baby case, she's on a walk with mama. Wiggler, Mola, Gamma, True. Good start. I didn't see that. Oily Boily Bay. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. No, he's the same wiggler that escaped from the oil rig. Seems I'm not coming down, there's six of us with this clown. I was wrong, you won the game. Don't rub it in, I feel ashamed. Fine, I'll tell you a secret. She hexed me, and now I'm wicked. One of the Yoshi's is really kamek. To pass, find her and lift the magic. Right, we have to do that first. I guess like my bars on the end blocks. Banger movement. Right, I forgot about this. Okay, let's reopen the room after that bug fix. Also, kamek not rotating is an issue. Let me fix that real quick. This is what happens. Also, this needs like a particle explosion. These three ones really need to be fixed. I'm glad there is something, but I made some adjustments, not gonna lie. Yes, that's the plan. I don't really have a bad idea for them right now. I agree that they're not great. So I might have set random mode opaque and opaque materials. To make them opaque? What do you mean? What would you like to set it to, transparent? Wasn't there also a bug that these don't work anymore? I should add more of this. Yeah. Okay, let's save the game, fix that. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. There's a worm on my brain. And it likes the sun. Oh, I see. It's underground on purpose. That makes sense. Burn it. Hello, squishy stache. It goes to one for like one frame, and then immediately disappears. I see. Shouldn't it be home? It looks like I programmed this well at first, and then just dropped the ball. Cool, cool, cool. I don't mean to go too far with co-op, but this is fine. What the fuck? Okay. I collected it there, but that's not what's supposed to go. Why is it alternating between 0 and 1? And then the coin is invisible. Did I write something over 0x76? It's the gold baby. Makes sense. I kind of ran out of model ideas. That makes sense. I can clamp to this. I can clamp to this. Okay. Makes no sense, but oh well. Now I see. Let me just mark this climbable to make this more playable. Yeah, I mean that's a requirement for sure. So why set it manually? Because for two cycle mode, often you need to set it manually, because otherwise it's not going to be set to anything. It's usually like the main problem. So what I did just now should also solve the other issue. Of the trigger going between 0 and 1 all the time. I think we should have another spot like this somewhere. I think that's fun to just jump around on from thing to thing. You know what I mean? What if we had like lava platforms here? Oh that would be so cool. I'm gonna do that. There we go. But that's fine for now. Zero. Zero three. So we just need to number them through. Cool. That's so practical. One. Two. Another blue coin spawner. It's been elched. Sick as hell. I'm after the whole world. I like how the world actually makes sense. True. Pixels requesting the Neverhood OST on Discord. Okay, fine. Oh no, not this fucking thing again. We did this already. Oh my god. It's gonna drive me crazy, but fine. Four pixel. Hey, it's perfect. Why do you want this pixel? Why are you doing this to me? Well this one's actually fine, but it got really weird later on. Oh right, we still need to do Bone Dragon. I forgot about that. Shit. Okay, that's definitely the wrong text. Hi! Hi! Bro is cruddy. The camera shake effect is very cool. The way this overworks is kinda cool, because you can just fly to the next part. And also, if you fall down anywhere, it actually puts you into the correct spot. Like right here. Incognited incognito. Hello. Okay, right. The hint block. I don't know why it said die stinky text. Isn't that supposed to be six? Oh, nevermind, it was zero. What is this? Who's pinging me? Oh, it's Pixel. Wait, Pixel actually asked for this again. I thought Pixel watched a stream where I listened to this and went mad. Baby just points at the screen and says Papa? That's great. Is there an experiment on PC for this game to be an emulator or a decompiled Mario 64? Decompiled Mario 64? How are you gonna play this? That's a bizarre question. It's like... Imagine you're invited to a show. Imagine you're invited to a dinner and you ask, should I dress nicely for this or come by car? That's about what you just did. So, I don't know what the fuck you're asking, basically. Wait, did I do a soy jack? Ah, come on. It's not a soy jack. It's just... I guess I am pointing at the screen. My kid does the soy jack whenever you give her food. She always asks me for my food. She never asks Zena for her food. She always wants my food. And then I give it to her and she goes... That's funny. Alright, we went through the overall ones. Time to add animals. And butterflies. Let's see. We already have some butterflies here. Do we want even more is the question. I think we could have some on the house here. What about birds? Bro is dying. Quick vibe check on this. See if this is about the right amount of birds. What is this hilarious music? Neverhood, I think was the name. Oh, the birds are cool. The massive size difference between the two birds. Placing the birds away is fun. Okay, I would say that's the right amount of birds. Let's add more birds to the level. I think the birds actually fly off in the direction that they are facing on spawn. I think all the birds in this area fly towards those guys. I think that would be fun. There could be a bunch of birds on this building. I think that would work well. I don't know, but I don't think this is making enough sense when they all show up at the same time. I don't remember Skellogg's videos about that. Dude, if you saw Skellogg's video about the castle clipping into itself and knew the story behind why he made those videos, it is so hilarious. Those videos were made with as much hatred in your heart as you could possibly make a video about Peach's castle clipping into itself. It's actually hilarious. I think tears were running down his face as he was making that video. That would be very funny biomechanics. But come on, do we really want Mario to do more evil? Well, Marty, the idea is that there is going to be an in-game map. Which I still need to add. And then you're going to be using the in-game map to warp to level entrances right away, which is going to be really cool. Right, yes, the placeholder text. I think you'll be able to warp to all courses and the Bowser levels. This is not made very well for the screenshot, but maybe Zayna can make something nice. And I'm just like, nah, nah, nah thank you, I'm done. I'm just like, nah, nah, nah thank you, I'm done. I have to impatiently wait 30 seconds to load a small room that I'm planning to run out of as soon as I get into it. Sorry that I value my time. My bad. Super Chipflake U? That's a fucked up name. Let's see if he's got the right text now. Oh Mario, I'm back to me. I don't know what came over me. Oh Mario, I apologize. I don't know how I told such lies. It was such a horrific time. I feel like I lost my mind. Now I'm good. This ball is gone. Have a nice day. Carry on. It's kind of awful. That's not Bows, that's awful. The name is very good, but the name is hard to Google. I imagine if you have a name that fucked up, you are sacrificing players. Here's a little cat that just sounds like UwU. I see. That does sound very cute. I'm thinking I should add dead crabs to this part of the overworld. Shit, I just realized I still need to add Clarks. This game I released a lot of years developing this. Yeah, every time someone asks, I add one extra day. So basically every time I stream, around 10 people ask, so basically whenever I come out, I stop streaming. Aren't those not frame perfect? There we go. That's better. Boshi? Boshi, where are you? Why, Boshi? Boshi, why? That's a bug. Is this NPC true? I think birds are dumb. Butterflies. Birds can have issues with this? Possibly, I'm not sure. Probably. Bodacian, bodacian, bodacian. The nice end block needs a smaller talk radius. I will warn you though that I have not done anything specific to support PAL, so it might just happen to work, but like, right now I haven't done anything to make it work. Now if it is reasonable to make it work, then I will, but I can't promise that it will be reasonable. This overworld kinda has nothing in it. No flowers. I guess it's fine, because it's like, inside the building. It needs fish, yeah. I think we got butterflies. Let's do crabs. We could add some underwater crabs here. That is true, the variable frame rate helps a lot, probably, in supporting a lot of things to at least work semi-decently. It wouldn't be a toggle, I'm pretty sure the game can just auto-detect that. Three crabs here is completely fine. I think I want a dead crab in this overworld here. I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. Dead crab. Alright. Let me see how the butterflies feel on the previous overworld part. The mushrooms. Oh that's kinda nice. This feels so lively now. Alright you will destroy it. The overworld. Grasshoppers next. Do we have common zero? We do. We can just put a few grasshoppers all over the place. No big deal. Grasshoppers fit very well here as well. Now that I think about it. Yeah this is the perfect place to spawn grasshoppers. Probably none where there's only water. I think that's all we want for grasshoppers. Seagulls! We need more seagulls. We need seagulls here but not here. And here too. Alright. Let me check out the grasshoppers first and then. Honestly I think the seagulls and the cheep cheep and the fish and the spiders we're gonna leave that for next time. I might actually do this off stream. We might actually start a side level next time. Because there's a lot of side levels missing. And I'm hoping we can finish the side levels in like 2 or 3 days each. That will feel like a lot of really fast progress. Do you guys remember when we made Super Mario 64 Land on stream in 2017? Where we made like one level every 2 or 3 days? It's going to feel kind of like that I think. Man Mario 64 Land was a wild time now that I think about it. I really made that whole game in like half a year? I'm crazy. I'm insane actually. How's Mario 64 Land not more relevant nowadays? I don't know whether it's worth RGD modding it because I don't know your personal priorities. Missing warp. How? How is the warp suddenly missing? I didn't add anything. I warped from ID 0. Cool. Do they crash every area they're in? No I don't think so. They seem just fine here. Do I need to load the model? Is the console bank not loaded here? It is. Wait. I was able to load the other area with all the grasshoppers. What? Where are they? Did I screw up the model ID maybe? Warped into our nation. Did I save it without the grasshoppers and then compile and then not compile again? What? Here arrives FC. Wait, how's this castle inside area 0? There should be castle grounds area 0. That's what happened. I exported the wrong level. I just saw your analog 3D video. Since it's an RPG, does that mean that most issues can be fixed in software? Thanks for the good work. The FPGA engineer on the analog told me that they can fix it on their end without any new hardware buds. Okay, I see. Now it fixed the level export. Now we should be able to see this. FPGAs are pretty cool technology. I mean most technology is very cool. There is very little technology that is not cool. Ah, there's my grasshopper. Nice. This is a sprawling jungle now. So cool. Alright, I think that will be all for today. Offstream I'll be adding more animals to this and then I'll be getting started on the first side level. We will also soon split this overworld into 14 different levels to reduce load times a little bit. And what we plan to do in the end is that when I go from here to the next area, you see how this is like winding? Then you will already be able to see the next area here and instead of the star transition you will just be here. So yes, until next stream, bye bye.
