No. Right, we were working on this part here. And the line, that is the glow. And in case, hello Larkis and Chet. Hello Larkis and Chet. Hello Biomech. Hello TeaTime, hello Fear of Darkness. And hello wolf. If I still feel it's already Sunday, true. I had, dude, actually, my week felt like a fucking eternity. It is crazy to me to think that last Saturday was the Teemo video. That's just bizarre to me. That feels like it was a month ago. Hello Jordan Elliott. Hello Kona Chocolate. Anyway, we wanna work on this part here. Where if you hit the thing, a line goes by and then it blows off a cap of this thing here. So let's make the cap first. Oh yeah, I was working on this off-stream. It's not finished yet. But I will show you guys anyway. Let's go! Pew. Pew. So you hit these guys. The first guy is a tutorial. And then three guys come on. And they're gonna shoot bullets at you. Pew. Pew. Pew. Pew. And then after you hit all three, the section ends. And I haven't finished this part yet. And there's still some work left to do. As it's not difficult to tell. But yeah. This is because the old snuffer chase was ass. Now for the flying upside down part. Don't worry, it's gonna stay on final. But a little bit better than it is right now. Do we have any cool OST wishes today? Do we have any cool OST wishes today? Today I want something interesting. I'm feeling like... Like listening to something cool. You know what I mean? Maybe smoothen the edges here a little bit. Maybe smoothen the edges here a little bit. Also Biomech, the project I told you about. It is going to start phase 1 tomorrow. And I think mid-January I'm gonna try to bring you on. It's just we have a lot of stuff to do before any artist can be on the project. It's just we have a lot of stuff to do before any artist can be on the project. Sonic Mania? You know what, Nintendogs sounds fun. It's been a very exciting week for me. Unfortunately, not many things I want to talk about just now. Hello, FabFabs? Dice? Okay. Goodbye, FabFabs. I will show you the... I already got a good chunk of the thing planned out. But yeah, I won't be talking about it on stream actually. I think that's just a bad idea. Gang, do we need to talk about the Teemo sponsorship? So many people got mad at me. I had no idea there was anything wrong with Teemo. I've only had good experiences with them. But when I say that, I'm worried that people actually take what I say as a genuine endorsement. And I really do not give a fuck about Teemo's bottom line. And I don't give a fuck whether I use Teemo. I also think people are being a little unfair. Do you use generative AI to create textures? What is your stance on generative AI? I don't use AI, no. See, for me personally, I know that generative AI results in a lot of bad things for people in total. I don't think it's necessarily an issue with the technology. I think it's an issue with how people use the technology. With the incentive structures we have created in society, that's an issue. That being said, I know people hate gen AI. And just because of that, I am not going to use it in my game. I kind of just bend to the rules. Because it's not like gen AI would be a big positive to the game. I actually don't think gen AI is capable of helping in the game. So there's two reasons I wouldn't use it. The first is people would hate me for it. And the second is there's no use case for it right now. Do you have time for a Minutemen release? Nope. Surprising because you've never seen a team sponsorship. Same. AliExpress is better. I'll be briefing over what our favorite Chinese reseller is. But yeah, people were saying shit like they use slave labor and they steal your credit card info. Which, what the fuck? I don't even know if that's true. But if it is, then... If I had known that, I really wouldn't have taken the sponsorship. Hello, Sarah. Baitable. Maybe you could fire Mardup and have Sunu make the OST. Sunu make the OST? Sunu is a ligma, I'm not falling for it. Son of a bitch. It's son of a bitch. That's what it's a ligma for. The backlash can be huge. I do love it, but I think we do the same if it was in your shoes. Yeah. Wait, you love AI? Wait, that's the first time I hear someone just say they love AI. I only ever hear people say they hate us. It's a ligma for Sunu, the AI music generation website. Okay. Funny that I thought it was son of a bitch. See, okay, this is something. Inherently, I feel like I should make jokes about AI and hate on AI and shit on AI so people will like me. Do you know what I mean? I feel like this would give me good point points in society. AI sucks donkey balls? See what I mean? Have you seen the Vintex 12MB expansion pack? No. Does it work? You know, in... Wait. Wait. In the N64 homebrew discord, we have this meme, days without... Wait. Let's see if I can find it. Like every 3 or 4 days someone asks about the more RAM expansion and then someone posts the picture of it's been 0 days since the last post about the RAM expansion. It's something people ask so many times that they have made a meme out of it. I can't find it though. I'm not gonna use it. Use AI a lot? You think you pay around $500 in subscription combined per month? Do you use it commercially? Do you like flood YouTube with AI slop? Is that what you pay for? Good boy points can be exchanged for nothing? That's false, because I'm a content creator. Good boy points directly translates into money for me. Yeah, I've seen too many memes which AI turns on, man. Okay, I'm going to say one thing. That... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm going to defend AI by shitting on superhero movies. And that is that... I think... Basically, superhero movies... They're also slop. In the same way AI is slop. And when you hate AI and you watch a superhero movie, I think that makes you a hypocrite. It's the same type of slop. 0 days since someone asked what I really thought about AI? True. I prefer my slop made by men. Well, AI was made by men, so... That just sucks. I don't know. I don't know what's going on with my wrist. I fucked it up somehow. Like, I'll remember doing things I don't want to bother with, but AI just looks like trash. I think this is a general thing in society, that we don't really differentiate between art and pictures anymore. It took so long to discover that face-moving is a spectrum rather than binary? I always knew it was a spectrum, but I never knew how to actually get the values other than 0 and 1 on it. Ian Brandon Anderson? Liquid Chris? That is funny, Clayman. But I'm not surprised. Smooth normals? Oh, I see. Oh, I see. $500 a month for fun? That's a very expensive fun. That's a $6000 a year hobby. That's crazy. I think AI looks like trash is a rare argument that won't hold up at some amount of time. There are many reasons to criticize without touching on quality. Yeah. That is for sure true. Guys, I have so much beef with media literacy fans. Pissing me off. I know so many people that are like... Media needs to have a message, but like... No, when it has a message, I think that's just propaganda. It needs to have a worldview. No? Hello, Ireland. Marie Jewel? What is Jewel? I don't know. I was thinking of taking a sponsorship from 8BitDo. They make really good controllers. I actually use their controller. I have one right here. Okay, now you're making me think that your $500 a month usage on AI includes an AI girlfriend, which... I don't know if I would like that. The idea that I have a fake machine girlfriend that a big company can control and they can just extort as much money as they want from me or kill my loved ones legally is a little scary. That's why you run your girlfriend locally. Hm. I know there's a lot of people out there that just put out pictures with like... Nothing to it. And they're like, this is my art and AI couldn't recreate it. And it's like, yeah, AI can recreate that. They can't recreate the suffering you've endured while making this picture, sure, but like... I mean, the output is like... The output was never worth anything. But then you look at something that I would consider like actually a valuable art piece, like Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis. Which like, yeah, fucking AI can't recreate that. At least I don't think it could. Not in a meaningful way. But I recognize this is not something I should have a balanced take on. I should just relentlessly hate on it because that will make people like me. Don't just relentlessly hate on it. Because that will make people like me. Marking germ-makybae-sbzyozbzysgetatechterms, SIG1984, where terms that definition are rendered...  Complex concepts, everything is AI this or AI that. No one calls it softy these days. I know that a lot of like... We don't know this because we are like people in tech. But a lot of normal people call basically everything AI now. Everything AI now. Who pings me here? Is this important? I'm already 16 for Romhack server. Wait, Romhack of the year, Paul? Wait, wait, wait, we are answering this. Y'all wanna see the Romhack of the year, Paul? Shit, let's do it on stream right now. Saying AI can replace the badass things. Game rendering is trying to get rid of trans people in the next level. This is really big and this I would help you with. That's saying you're badass, that's not what I said at all. I said it can do things that are not even art to begin with. Let's see, best visuals. Mario Adventure 2, Mario Multiverse. Okay, I've seen Mario Adventure 2, I like this one. I've seen Mario Multiverse, Adventure 2 looks a lot better. Although it's kinda unfair if he wins this because he didn't model any of these. Best music. They're all in all worlds. Wait, what? There's only like 5 in total? I think I have to give this to Patchmaker's Workshop because I don't... This is kind of unfair for me to answer that, Paul, because I haven't played all of these. Best worldbuilding. Definitely Patchmaker's Workshop. Best tech for beginners. Probably Mario Multiverse. Best kaizo hack. Can I just not answer? Best taboo hack. Probably Meltdown. Best competition hack. Mario's Modules is the only one that I actually think has any value. Actually, Bazaar also. Road to Chaos Edition actually also a little bit and I don't know the other ones. But I think this one is the most valuable one. Sand Link. Okay. Best mini hack. I think I'm also going to vote for Mario's Modules. Hello, Sunnydyte. You're my favorite engine. I actually don't see this here. Most innovative for Mario's Modules. Most anticipated. Most innovative for Mario's Modules. Most anticipated. Yoshi's Comet's tax fraud is still on here. That's crazy. I actually don't anticipate any of these because they all use base Mario 64 movement and they wouldn't want to fix it. Which is fair enough. Hack of the year. I think Mario Adventure 2. Okay. Those are my answers. Where are we? They don't put RTYI on this because they know we just win. It'd be not a fair competition. I think we're already one most anticipated in like 2021. Like it'd be silly to be on this poll. Yeah, don't worry about it. We shouldn't just like be upset that we're not getting the fancy award that we already know we would be getting. Like it's silly, right? It's not a fair playing field. Fair playing field. Yes. Algorithms, like fancy algorithms, they matter when you're like programming an engine. When you're doing like the inner workings of your thing. But for most programming, like maybe 90% of the work you do, you don't really have to understand any algorithms. You just program. Which I guess, whenever you program, you do algorithms like an if-else, for example. But like this is so basic, you wouldn't even want to invent a name for it. I mean, I would love to intentionally include Ace, but I'm not really sure how to do that in an elegant way. I don't just do it. I mean, imagine you put RDY on there and then it doesn't win best visuals and best music and everything. Because we have like a full custom LST with biobank reworked levels. On-screen keyboard to write your own code? Yeah, sure. No, no, you're not called Christmas by a Christian name in Norway, but we just call Santa Julisnesen. You guys ever think about how it's fucked up that we have multiple fat guys with a red hat come around Christmas? First there's Nikolaus, then there's the Christmas man, and then there's Santa Claus. Three of them. And now there's also Julisnesen. There's even a fourth one. Where the fuck is Christmas man? You don't know the Christmas band? They've been sleeping under a rock? No, in Germany we have two. We have Nikolaus and Christmas man. And here in America they have Santa Claus. Are you coding in Google Forms? No. I'm not from the US either. Dude, wait, where's the AI fan? I need to talk to the AI fan. Look, I've been programming a Mario AI that beats Mario 64 by itself. Unfortunately it crashes after a couple hours of training right now, so it never got smart enough. But I've observed it do some cool shit. Who is pinging me again? What does any of this have to do with the Lord Christ Jesus? Bro, we're talking about Christmas, we're not talking about religion. These two are completely unrelated. Let me see the AI. Well, it starts off really dumb, so it wouldn't make any sense. I also want to clarify, my AI does not eat a million tons of water. It runs on an N64, it is trained on an N64. If you play Mario 64, you waste just as much water. Just have to say that real quick. It should probably use less water than playing Mario 64, because it doesn't render while it's doing stuff. Is record set cool shit? No, I don't know. I know that Christmas is a weird Christian thing in Canada, but I thoroughly enjoy the vibes and look gluvine. Oh my god, stop pinging me everyone. Fuck you, Biobank! I can't believe he made me look. That sounds like bullshit. I don't know what Chloe is. Oh yes, I will wait until Deltarune is complete before I play it. I will understand your joke in 5-10 years, this is correct. Change generation algorithm? I don't have one, I'm not that much of a nerd. The points are inverted, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine. I'm not fine with this. Anyone know how to invert the points on the NURBS curve? Why did I do this? Yeah, they went the wrong way around. Like, the last point was where the beginning is. And I want them to be the right way around. Don't see it. Fine. I will simply not make that mistake next time. But have you ever seen someone get a gift that wasn't the most appropriate gift for them? I had a friend when I was younger, he was blind. Yes, he told me this before. What did you guys think of the Analog 3D this track? I thought it was awesome. People seem to like it. Hello New? Hello. Why are you asking that? When N64s don't exist, they do. Why are you asking that? Your brain is poisoned to 4 spatial dimensions? Can you actually imagine 4 spatial dimensions? That's crazy. You can just start making a game, you don't really need to learn anything. All you need to start making a game is basic logic and how to print a pixel. That's all you need. Then you can just start making games. Think about it. Well, that's what you need. I'm getting nervous. I'm getting nervous. Nope. I don't actually want this. Let's do this. Hello Punk and DTH. Hope you get your 30k. Imagine if they actually tried to bribe me and then the video would be down and everyone would know that they bribed me. I understand, sorry. But same blind kid, his mother let him drive her car because he was jealous because my brother was letting him drive. That's crazy. That's crazy. Wait, what the fuck is this? What the fuck? What have I programmed here? How is this working? Let me take a look. It's not a bribe if you have a Patreon page. I don't understand. Why is meme review images only? Because people take too long otherwise? What? I think I see the vision here. What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Yes, this is what I want. This is so stupid. Okay guys, I had an idea for the engine release. And that is, I'm gonna finish all my engine rewrites. Before the game is finished. Obviously, I have to finish before the game is done. And then I'll remove all the game content from the repository and release only the engine. For people to take it apart and hopefully find improvements, bug fixes and maybe help remove any remaining Nintendo code that I may have missed. So that way we can improve the engine even more before the first public release of the game. I think that would make a lot of sense. I have never done web scraping, no. Okay. Okay, everyone seems to like that idea. That's good. I was thinking it would come with just a test map with nothing in it. So you can just move around with Mario. Is the test room to test everything in the engine and such a room in the latest demo? Oh, yes. Like a test room with all the features that were gonna be in the game. Okay. To do this. Well, the idea for RTYI would be that I would also make a PC port with a custom IP and maybe put it on Steam. But that is something I'm obviously fucking afraid to do. The custom version would be no Nintendo code, not even Mario. It would be a completely custom move set. Okay. Very scary it is. I would definitely have to talk to a lawyer about it beforehand. So don't consider this something I will definitely do. Consider this a if I can legally do it type thing. Like if I have a 100% completion rate, I think since there's no more Metal Cap, whatever resolution I'm looking at, cosplaying as Mario would be awesome. I have not thought about that yet. Okay. I take it down for apparently having solo move sets, cos I know I'm supposed to bend the source code of Mario. Yeah, well, the movement would be completely different. I do not know CTPGP. Okay. I mean, this is kind of weird to leave it in a maybe state, because like if the lawyer says, yeah, you can do it, I'll probably release it and we'll make a ton of money off it. I'll be bridged basically instantly. And if he says, no, you can't, then like my life goes back to normal. So I guess it's not something to worry about, because the worst case scenario is nothing fucking happens. But it is weird to have this in the back of my mind. You know what I mean? Okay. Do I need to raise the money to pay more lawyers? That honestly would be like the venture capital method of doing it. Okay. Using AI at all? No. We talked about this earlier. The lawyers with the A3D bribe money. Do people actually understood that I wanted, like genuinely I'm asking for a bribe, because that would be sad. I did not want people to think that. Of course not. Okay, good. Because one person did DM me and they thought I was actually asking for a bribe. This is a good meme. Okay, good. I'm glad it didn't come across that way. For a second, I thought I actually did sound like that. Someone level idea generated by AI as a joke. No. One of the enemies can actually have any AI, so it would make the game a bit too easy. Obviously the enemies have an intelligence. Okay, there's different types. The word AI has lost all meaning. Some people mean AI to be like logic at all. But when people say AI, they usually mean machine learning. Dinos with the dism, you can't piece every single hottest. I see. Okay, let's see how this works. I didn't export the object yet, so it will not work. Let's do that. Okay. Enemy is kind of proof that script enemies can look like they're smart in some ways, so we will call it AI. But legally what? This is live? Yes, this is live, sad diamond. That's not a video. If you're watching on YouTube, this might actually not even be live. This might be from the future. I keep going here. Am I stupid? Where did my thing go? Did it go underground or something? Did I compute this wrong? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh. Does this mean you have d-pad movement already? No, the thing about d-pad movement is, right now the d-pad is like my debug things here. You see that? So I don't want to add that to it yet. I did that again. But I think the final build will have it. Okay, that's clearly wrong. It needs to be cosine here. I'm pretty sure the trigonometry I put here is completely fucked up. I'm pretty sure I inverted the circle twice now, but I don't care. Okay. I actually don't like how easy it is to just be behind on YouTube. Okay. So it mostly works. Okay. Why is this part not working? Where is blood going through? Hello, Xlings. Hello, Xling. It's a very early version. It's not supposed to hit yet. Okay. How could this ever not be minus one at the end? How about we just print this? Think about it. I'm old. I'm washed. Is that an X coordinate? Okay. It said 255 for a second. Minus 255. Oh. Oh, I see. What's the wrong spline type? Do you not have labels for the pipes? I don't. I know which pipe I have to go into, I just autopilot into the wrong pipe because I was doing a lot of testing in that level. Okay. So it is animated, but it's not animating. What? What is going on? Okay. Original Half-Life 1064 for no reason. If you pay me enough money, I might do it. But this is like $400,000 territory. And if you don't pay me, then I have no interest in doing it. Half-Life fucking sucks. I don't get how people like Half-Life. I played the game, it's bad. Oh yeah, let me just run into a room, make a save state, present act on everything. Oh no, I get shot, I'm gonna load the save state. I'm gonna go and present act on everything again, and this time I win. I'm in the next room, and I go around and I present act on everything. Oh man, what a fun gameplay loop. I apologize for rage baiting. This is not who I want to be as a person. One day I'm gonna enter the correct path on the first try. Oh, there's clearly some issues here. Oh, and it still doesn't end. Cool. So something about its material is not good. Xbox got six frames. Weekly Half-Life? It's not weekly, come on. In Mario Ghost Story 6, alright, here's what I think about it. First, I tried to implement your camera, people didn't like it. I have not seen it. Also, I'm not surprised. A lot of people complain about my camera. But I do think my camera is very, very good. You might have also not implemented it perfectly, because my camera is a lot of small things you need to get right. It's been devised through a lot of playtesting. I need to do it this way around after all. Just because I had the wrong spline type, it didn't look that way. I didn't even enter the right wrong path this time. Okay, there we go. So once this happens, the top part is going to fly off, and you will be able to enter it. Do you guys think this is too difficult? Let's reset. Okay. What the fuck? We could slow it down a little bit, maybe up to 24. It will spin, so it's just going to launch you off. We thought about this beforehand. What's happening to my sparkle, though? How is it not just being at home? Oh, we're not setting halt, that's why. Mm-hm. And now, the factory top. Custom crash headbutt? Define custom. I was actually thinking of putting a minigame into the crash screen, just so it's like, okay, the game crashed, but, you know, at least you unlocked a cool secret easter egg. I think they did something like that with the Sonic game as well. I think it's a cool way of handling it. Oh. Yes, so you have to crash the screen to beat the game, that makes sense. Does that even always work? Yeah? What are you talking about with Pi game? My god, this is starting to piss me off almost as much as people talking about Mode 7. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Sure enough about Mode 7. This was not an invitation to talk about Mode 7. Ah! How big is this? 281.5 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I know why it's 0. Horror vs. Motomori, okay, but the Crash.net should be Mario-themed Tetris game, what? The game at the end would be the Chrome Offline Dinosaur game, if you crash the game. I think I fucked up, but let's see. Oh, actually that looks kind of good. Okay. Just needs a bit more velocity. I didn't know I was going to do it again. People are making fun of me. I'm not going to do it this time. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. Right here. Let's go. I don't make simple flips hacks. I hate when ROM hackers just make hacks that are so focused on one content creator. I think it's ultra cringe. Unless you're making fun of the content creator. Like one ROM hack that I think is peak, that I made, that's focused around a ROM hack creator, was the PewDiePie hack. Do you guys know the PewDiePie hack I made? Do you guys know the story of it? It's awesome. You guys want to hear it? You guys want to hear it? Alright, so I think this was in 2017. This was like a few months after the PewDiePie bridge incident. The bridge incident where PewDiePie plays a game, I don't know what game it is, he gets shot in the game and he calls someone the hard R. It was what a fucking N-word. That's what he says. And the SMG4 bros were like, you know, this was in wake of the subscribe to PewDiePie thing. I don't know how he got away with it. I don't know how he could drop a hard R as an insult and then three months later drop like a diss track against Indians that's like super giga racist. But also everyone on YouTube in 2017, remind you this is 2017, this is not 1917. People were like, yeah, we need to get PewDiePie to more subscribers than T-Series. Anyway, they paid me to make a ROM hack centered around subscribing to PewDiePie. And in this ROM hack, I put a level that is the bridge from the PewDiePie video. And you have to beat all the Goombas before PewDiePie drops the N-word. And then like when you don't do it, it's just a clip of the game. But it's censored. It's censored with the penguins going Mrs. Obama, get down. I don't know, I love that. It was one year later, the racist India track or him dropping the N-word was a year later. As an insult, as opposed to doing it as a compliment. I mean, maybe I'm wrong on this, but I feel like there is a difference between just saying the word in a vacuum and calling someone that word as an insult. You know, Ace Tensis of Super Mario World, the mega-league games like Snake or Pong or Flappy Bird. Yes. One of those Metroid Prime Dinosaur games, well, it's not going to be that, that's fancy. 2017 was a different time. I don't know. I feel very vindicated that nowadays people are complaining about PewDiePie and that the whole thing was very racist. Because I was saying it at the time, I was saying at the time, this is kind of fucked up. And there was no one complaining about this. I did it again! Did it again, Santa 7? Thanks, I'm old. Ah, that's not bouncy enough. I want it bouncier. It went under people's noses? I don't know. It was very popular in content creation culture for a little bit, to talk about it. But everyone was like, oh, it's PewDiePie, it's fine. He didn't mean it. It was just a reflex. Which, if that's a reflex, I think that's a lot worse. Okay, I see. Okay. Hello, CinemaStorms. Don't worry, he is Swedish. What? Some light in the corner of the hall, I think you should go in. That doesn't... I learned. I went into the right pipe. It's all going pretty well, except I keep going into the wrong pipe. What the hell? What the hellie? What? What the hellie? How? Can this run on the GameCube? Sure. Swedish equals basically Asian? What? You have to get in that way. And you can. Could it be that this is an issue? Like, what if we just do this again? Like, what if he just does a million bounces a second, right at the beginning? Oh, wait, and we also use angle without pitch here. That would do it. Yeah, it shouldn't be doing a million bounces a second. That should be impossible. That should be impossible. Can this run on Productions 4? Do you have eyes? Look at my screen. Yes, can this game fix my marriage? Okay, okay, okay, we get the bounce. We just need the right seed speed for the animation. Okay, we're getting there. I did the right thing. Dude, do you think there's going to be a time in the future where we run games routinely on modified Mycelian networks? Ooh! Ooh-hoo-hoo! Fancy! Unfortunately, it was 180 degrees rotated from what we wanted. But fancy! What? Bro, it's kind of fucked up that mushrooms are just like a secret third thing next to plants and animals. Have you ever thought about why mushrooms and plants never evolve motion? It's weird, no? Why do they not evolve motion? There's so many of them. I just need the right seed speed. We're just going to force this until it works. The title of the game is Textures, Meshes, Audio, and Codes respectively. Coach. 1.6%. Audio. 80%. Textures and stuff. 15%. Oh, that's so close. So close. Can I just reduce this here? Bro, will you be able to run MUPIN64 if I open your head and I program MUPIN64? I don't think so. Bro, will you be able to run MUPIN64 if I open your head and I program MUPIN64 into my CD network and I put this into your brain and it's going to grow spores and there's going to be mold growing on your brain? Can that mold play Mario 64? Okay. It's so nice, but it's the wrong way around again. The author is barely disguised in Fantish? No! There are flesh-eating plants that use motion? True, actually. Okay, then why is there no mushroom emote? Still, they have way less motion than animals. No, no, no, wait, I don't count as no. I mean, I guess the special thing about animals is that they get their energy from photosynthesis and I guess that's very slow. But like, they store energy. They could photosynthesize and then move. Or something. Okay. Okay, that's getting close. Dart! That's kind of like the Mario Party song. Okay, I think that's actually not terrible. Like, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong. I think it maybe needs to go a little further, no? Like, what if we do this to 0.55? I think it will look very good then. I mean, if anything, you can survive not doing that. I mean, then that would apply to animals too. Then that would apply to animals too. And there's also very few animals that are like, stationary. I guess there's anemones. Every time someone asks me for a release date, I move it by one day. So, the release is now in 2014. So, it's pretty doable. But it feels kind of not good. Right? Like... What if we just made it so that if Mario gets under here, it just flies off? Okay. Wait, this is going to be the speedrun strat. Oh, what a banger! Okay. Wait, why is the alarm sound here? The alarm sound shouldn't be here. Something bugged out. Okay. Some people were saying that death to Voidot takes too long, but honestly it feels very fair. Oh my god! And those. There's been a video episode of asking for a release date will make release faster. Sure, whatever the episode of that is. That room is so cool, it reminds me of that mini-game where you have to assault the boss by colour. Yeah. I was worried that the room takes a little too long to just sit around. But I like the idea of it. Okay, yeah, but we need the solution for when Mario gets under the thing. Because I don't like the idea of Mario getting crushed here. Yeah, I also think that the transition length is fine. But we'll have to actually see this in gameplay. Because there comes a point at which you reduce friction so much that you lose the game's purpose and soul. And it just turns into slop. And I don't want to make it slop. Hmm. I guess the other option is... The sparkle just stops if it's too far ahead. And then you just do it once and the thing flies off forever. But that feels a little jank. That feels a little jank. It's just too awkward to be under it. It's too easy to get crushed. I guess another option is... We make the shape something like this. And now you can't be under it. Honestly, I think this is the play. Because that way it's like an on-off thing. Yeah. I mean, Vanish reminds me, I think, that S.V.A.N.I.S.H. has a completely separate character. No, I have not. I mean, I don't really care that much for it. There's many mods that render characters to random games. I didn't make it bigger. I just made it so you can't stand there anymore. Martian shout. And it happens. Yeah. And then on every bounce it should make a sound. Yeah. I'd say I don't need that. Yeah. Yeah. We do this. Wasn't there like a metal bounce? Yeah. Metal bounce is what I want. That will play. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Here. Yeah. Then it's like an electric noise too. So. Okay, nice. Okay, it's pretty doable. Okay. Now... Permanent. Screen space coordinate thread 5. For this. And then... Bus. Bus is what we want. Yeah. Dude, we're almost done with section 8 now. That's cool. Washi and the double Yoshi explosion? What? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually this is fire, right? This shouldn't be. I need a fire sound. Oh. Oh, I see. I actually played Woolly World. Woolly World is very fun. The only thing I have to complain about is that when you are in multiplayer, the person that is behind holds up the whole screen and it pissed me off because Sena went very slow. And I often had to kill myself just so the other person could make progress. Like, it sucks for both players. Basically just cripple each other in multiplayer. As opposed to New Super Mario Bros. Where you help each other. Hello, how are you? People ask that all the time. But I'm like, that's none of your business. Oh. That is such a crunchy noise. Yes. Okay, that's easy enough, right? I like it. What's with the sound here, though? Why is the sound not muted as it should be? I wanna look into that real quick. I bet it's something stupid. Oh. You can't grab the ledge. Oh. Why did it not compile before? Weird. It didn't change anything. I could have just gone to the level directly. Oops. Oh. Aww. And they're like Why does your run make lag, bro? That's going to piss me off. Okay, I need to just go to the end of those runs to see what the hell is going on here. Oh. That's nice. It's surprising to hear people say they like Lost and Backed, because I've heard so much hatred for it the last few years. Oh. It didn't fade out at all. Wait, BPM4 is zero? I'm pretty sure LSG told me it was 12. Not zero. Or 11? I think it's 11. Why was this set to zero? Was it 12? No. It is 12. Now the sound is like it should be. How did this happen? Well, whatever the issue may be, I better check the level. Oh. No. 64Land has ParallelCam. I'm pretty sure. It would make sense in 64Land. And Last Impact, I get it. ParallelCam is stupid. I stand behind that. In 64Land? 64Land needs ParallelCam. If 64Land doesn't have ParallelCam, then I fucked that one up for sure. Do we have to do something else to appear in the video credits besides something on Patreon? No. If I missed you last time, then I'm sorry. I might have not updated the Patreon card in a bit. I don't update them every single time. I might have accidentally not done that. But you should for sure be in the next one. Sometimes I finish a whole video and then it takes a month until it uploads. So it's a bit delayed, basically. Does it have D-pad movement? I think the D-pad movement is silly. Although, I guess Rty has it. I have changed my mind a little bit at least, I guess. I've heard that the Rust compiler for N64 is very bad. I don't know how true that is. But the code snippets I've been shown were horrendous. It's basically worse than the compiler they used in 1996 on Mario 64. And that compiler was bad. Very bad. It's like 50% in efficiency. Oh, nice, SnakeCalla. Hopefully, I can finish this soon, so you can do that. But it is going to be a little bit. Okay, so. We don't have this anymore. There's a secret fuse here. You press the switch. There's a cube light. Yep, this is after a few seconds. Makes smoke coming out of the chimney. I don't think we can even do this anymore. Oh, there's both effects. I don't think we can do this anymore. Oh, there's both effects. I don't think we can do this anymore. Invest by Shy Guys and Bombs. We got that. Root Juice Bar. That makes no sense. That probably was meant to go to part 9. Like this. Needs the bomb character to break a crack in the wall. Oh, I see. So there's going to be a breakable wall here. Favorites? I really like Luna Park. I know it's not a main level, but I like it a lot. My least favorite is definitely the Candy level. Anyway. Cooper Carnival is restricted to Bowsa's Minions. So there's going to be someone here blocking it. The initial idea was that there would be a Thwomp. He would block you just like Miko does. I think that's his name. So the Thwomp is going to be going left and right here. Just like Wario does. I'm kind of just worried about running out of RAM. That's honestly my worry right now. Which is stupid. I could have saved so much RAM by just not doing silly things. But I didn't. I don't care. Lost Circus is also very good. I agree. Although I think I could have done a lot more with the concepts in modern age. I would have gone so far further with it. I have no idea what you're talking about. I mean, I don't make B3313 and I don't see a reason that B3313 could not... BE could not exist on the N64. But I don't give a fuck about BE, so someone else has to do that. Maybe they asked me if I will ever do it. Because then the answer is no. Name BE unabandoned... What the fuck? I'm talking about BE, don't ask me. I'm innocent. I'm not on the BE flight logs. I have never been to BE island. And if I appear in the credits of BE then I was on the island for the snorkeling. I don't know. Where do we have normal thwomps? Do we have normal thwomps anywhere? I guess these ones are the closest ones. We can modify them. I don't know. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Such a night. Bad news bro, it's already Sunday. Aww, BE put a little heart on him. How cute. Tsk. How did this happen? Did I do something stupid? I messed up. What the hell? Are you trying rewriting the boss? No. This is just a custom thwomp. Not really an optimized version of anything. Tsk. I should do like a safety push. I wish my wrist didn't hurt. This is not an enemy, this is a guy that just guards the entrance to the Bowser Park and won't let you in. Tsk. I called that thwomp builder? No. Tsk. It's not arthritis? No, I think I just slept weird. You know, I'm that age where if you sleep weird your wrist hurts. Falling apart. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Hello Skyloft. I have not supported the Rumble Pack yet. Mostly because I do not have a Rumble Pack. Tsk. You aren't as nice as me? No. Like you're under-trained? That's not a problem. I'm very well-trained. I just fucked up my wrist. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. I'm copying a lot of code, I know, but we're not actually using all of this. Tsk. Hello world. Should there be a mandatory dialogue? Before he lets you in? Or should he just step aside? Because the way it would work is like he tells you all you need is when he starts to enter and then when you talk to him he's like okay, you can enter now. I think there needs to be a mandatory dialogue. Otherwise it's going to be weird. Tsk. And what's the star requirement you wanted, like 30 I think? I think 30 makes sense. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Half of max puzzle stars at the moment. Max puzzle stars at this moment is probably around 65, so yeah. Please don't accept commissions. Kind of, but I have to charge like a shit ton because I'm super busy. I do not recommend anyone to commission me right now unless they literally have so much money that they don't care. Tsk. You should say some shit like oh you're one of Boza's top guys. You're Boza's top guy. The romantic use to play FZR expansion can consider emulation? I don't know what that is. Oh my god, why is everyone talking about Pi game today? Am I getting ads or something? Are these real users? Why is everyone here talking about Pi game? Is Pi game like starting some shared GPD offense when they put like 15 different accounts into every YouTube stream that talk about Pi game? It's a virus? Pi game is a virus? Everyone listen up, Pi game is a virus. Do not download Pi game. ... Oh god. Oh, that's disgusting. This is horrible code. You should never do this. ... Is this a song request? This is a banger. Nevermind, what the fuck is going on? ... The roadmap right now is ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Wait, this is the tempo song. ... ... ... ... Yes, please unpause time. I'm stuck in time. Whenever you do that. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Okay. We got this now. ... ... ... ... ... So when you don't have enough stars, text 549. ... ... Then 550, 551. ... So in game and Python language, we'd consider this risk when you're gonna mention it today. It's a virus. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... That's a lot better ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... And he's not letting you in. You got me? Oh, it's a Twitch thing. As I noticed, you're on YouTube. I guess you just got lucky that I listened to your songs. Oh, I see. No, he's not gonna snap you. He's just gonna be there and not let you through. So the next step would be actually making it so that there's a blocking thing behind him, so that you cannot go in. And then, once you have enough stars and you talk to him, there's gonna be a cutscene of him walking out. And then you can enter the level for the rest of your life. I'm gonna do this again, because it's so fun. Awesome. Alright, I think that will be all for today. I got a lot of other work to do that I would like to finish. So that means I will see you guys next stream, which might just be tomorrow. Because I get two whole weeks of work, so I'll probably stream a little more than usual. So until then, bye bye!
