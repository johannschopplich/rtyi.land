you you oops that's the wrong level hello wb mario related you fixed in bvh bvh yes mostly i didn't have too much time to work on it um it boots fine now i can enter most levels there are some issues but obviously the bvh itself is still not working still need to ask someone how to do that actually on how to write a script here uh i'll have to look at it first before i ask them that see my bars and shit no we're gonna look at that right now they know it's when you stream on your channel um i don't want to stream on my main channel it would kind of dilute the content and i fear it might give me less views on my main channel videos but also the chat would be extremely annoying with that many people in it i would like to have a really big channel let's check on all the materials first but why is it like translucence hey so we're gonna have one issue here and that is that this needs to be world access aligned or it is absolutely not going to render fine so the property setting yeah i just set it up to a property call all right so this is a few triangles wasted that we don't need to waste and just uh do this oh let's uv map your square too i'll just copy the uv map in the top part how efficient you've gotten your collision use if uv agents are being slow it's no problem with it for the smaller ram footprints yes i actually agree but i actually think it will be faster by like a significant amount well i guess you also have to keep in mind my entire game's frame is like two milliseconds right now so how much can you really save but i actually care about rom space more than ram space at this point and it does take a small amount of extra rom space so yeah my cpu is just extremely efficient so a lot of things that would make sense on normal r64 do not make sense for my game yes the bvh is built in rom i suppose you could build it around time but that would be a significant loading time worthening i don't really want are we putting vario stand so a cat hi cat that was speedy n64 we do be working on that speedy n64 did you guys see that the analog 3d got delayed again i don't know where i saw this but someone posted a youtube opinion man video about it i actually also got an email from analog where it's like game delayed again you you that's a good idea yeah i think this is good this location did you guys see those mountains i like them a lot also any ost wishes yo ho jojo oh we're gonna get copyright struck the fuck out of our channel if we do that oh and we're free running in this game crazy jojo eurobeat all right let's do it god i'm feeling so exhausted today i feel like i haven't been able to sleep very well because recently starting at like 7 30 the baby just stands up and goes bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye in a crib and then i can't sleep anymore so i just disagree there that doesn't sound right to me so there is a software to allow for threading to work on the n64 i would not say that the n64 has thread support yeah the difference being like when you say it has thread support that sounds like there's something built in but like everything that is programmed can have some form of threading so it does it's just not running them in parallel okay what does the n64 specifically do to allow for threading that is like not something that can be in every software oh i don't think there are many MIPS instructions for threading unique chat mod i didn't set unique chat mod it was on forever hello asuko can interrupt already running code yes that's a software thing there's software running that interrupts the running code you send footprints i can't program everything at the same time spread supports and even its own stack for each thread however memories are available but that's a software thing memory for for each thread yeah you mean the stack pointer the most i can see where you can argue hey this is thread support is the k0 and the k1 register because they're supposed to not ever be used by the compiler and the threading code uses it to change the running thread but this is something you could do on like every software ever right as long as you have two registers and i'm not sure if they are well i guess as long as you have space to allocate one register that just goes unused which i guess is everything i don't see how this means that the n64 is thread support here what do you want me to see here okay how is this supposed to help me this is all software there's no hardware here okay it's not for me good so lemonade stand kinda accepts your star so let's see api for multi-threading it's kind of crazy so so oh my god takes forever what is taking so long all i did was set my repo path so okay i'm setting the world defaults i didn't wait so repo settings have world defaults let's see any of this warrior stand after you beat him in the zoo he's done being a zoo keeper and just opens the stand i did not know you could store world defaults in repo settings that is very helpful to know okay but why does it take this long oh it copied all these materials into the file so okay i don't remember which part specifically i complained about probably about the settings being someone this is not this tab that feels like something i would complain about so as soon as i turn on the stream i realize how tired i am so i'm currently watching jojo with zina she's liking it a lot so we're in part four two four and six are the best part two is definitely my favorite too um i actually like part seven the most as well but obviously that's not out yet so i've actually watched the first five parts of the anime and i've read the first seven parts of the manga zena is on part three right now they just arrived in egypt the boys so here's linux kinda we're closely watching your work and i'm really excited by how much you work i think you probably get out of time but do you ever get any time for release no but you can check the progress tracker if you'd like i actively updated this progress tracker here right here so you can see 100 100 100 100 98 70 75 70 75 98 this one is actually also 99 now because the gameplay testing just advanced so most of these levels are like almost done some of the later ones are not that close yet this one is probably the next one to get done leaps so yeah good progress so hello biomech it's been a while since you've been here shame so zero oh it's after the second star okay who's your real life since it's this summer fair enough so i'm gonna release date i'm not too excited about this song i haven't even played hello night yet because it doesn't have analog controls i'm like if a game doesn't have analog controls i will 100 refuse to play it if it's a platformer i am uncompromising on that one wow wow what was that thank you for the sub zeta zeta 382 kind of controls analog controls look i want if i hold my stick 20% to the left i want my character to run at approximately 20% of their speed i don't think it needs analog controls it's left right up down and you really have to down and it's either yeah but i can't go 20% left or 20% right to me that instantly makes it feel terrible so that's why i don't want to play it she's my keyboard no i don't like that you're not using a d-pad well i don't like using a d-pad either i know what i like missing out then i'm okay with that wait oh no never mind oh yeah you haven't even seen this biome look at this this fat ass is like you're not getting in here so you remember the whole penguin thing we did uh i thought maybe that's a little too much so now instead you just kind of have to go behind barry's back honestly if someone was that in love with motion controls i would just be a guard while you have your passion that's fine by me i forgot about this i added like a thing where every level that has an invalid shadow just crashes and there's a lot of shadow invalid shadows i want sonic and the secret ring controls or i'm not playing oh delta rune's not a 3d platformer or a platformer so i'm okay with that that kind of water looks yeah the water is pretty nice this one here still needs to like be made existing this one's just a flat plane right now oh interesting so ever since i added the stand and it's spawning no longer works cool i'm a little bit worried that we just ran out of geospace that would be pretty awful so yeah as soon as we render that thing it crashes wait i know what i did i forgot to link up the collision dude i have started working on collision bph today once that is done i have done with every engine reprogramming we will just be able to make the game how fucking cool is that the geospace uh the fucking area after engine before the first frame buffer it shouldn't tell you anything it should tell you literally nothing but that's what it is and i don't have a better answer than that for you oh all right um time to spawn vario there as well oh yeah we also have the message in a bottle this one's this one's my favorite like 12 eyes after me booty you shall never find it only i memorize the riddle to capture it plant yourself in a stone circle to greet your blue red and green friend sure right you're behind then back from eight times and found sand so obviously this is the riddle and the solution is you go to the stone circle and you look at your friends you turn around then you back from eight times hello boys two men and that's how you find the ice cap there's some os stuff but that won't change the api so it doesn't really matter that much things it's pretty good okay well we can still workshop it a little bit blue brown and green all right so again it's just the blue on okay it's fine it's even in the shape of these eyes it's it's a stupid question actually the the shape of these eyes is not that bad like it's good in the sense that the question is dumb and by the question being dumb it showcases that language is not the ground truth of the universe that we should be operating on you know what i mean so but is it a new ship or the same ship see that's the thing this is good what is what what does new mean like define new define same you know it only seems like a good question because language is so vague this is why i hate philosophy because almost all philosophy is just people like posting so actually the worst part about philosophy is that every time someone asks anything philosophical i start sounding like jordan peterson and that's the worst thing ever i don't want people to be like you're jordan petersoning out right now you're done running code maps doesn't make the solution obvious exactly it does that's the problem okay bye zaina but if you reprogrammed everything more 64 is it your game or is it some nintendo 64 that's for the lawyer to decide i'm calling it my game it does of course it does so if you say like a ship is the thing that makes it float and like same is literally the same parts then obviously it's not the same because it's not the same parts that make it float right because like they are all gone let's make everything out one by one makes it new i have to think about the meaning of new first you can have many different meanings depending on what you mean it can be new or not at the moment oh man and i made such a good point too hello no i o v for a bedtime video just there was a blast through it also my favorite thing was the new boat in level eight so much nostalgia i'm glad you like that so it doesn't matter if the ship will run well but it won't for no reason oh i'm stupid because all my ears are running after the ship that demands all of this yeah uh basically my answer to the question was that depends on what you mean by new like in some contexts new would be used in a way where the answer to the question is yes and in other contexts new would be used in a way where the answer to the question is no i mean let me give you an example that makes it really obvious what i mean um is a mouse an animal is a mouse an animal i mean some mice are animals and others aren't you right it is our computer peripheral exactly you know excuse me excuse me what answer it depends yes and i think my question is a mouse and animal makes that abundantly clear how it depends is a good answer so isn't it that you're more than the sum of your parts me personally i mean yes my parts interact more complex than summation and someone you consider an object to be its parts or something other are pretty different questions they are very different questions but i think they are of the same species those two questions so hello autodidact what does it mean to call a question part of a species it just means they're closely related if you change all the question is it really the same question okay we changed them all with uh what's the what's the thing comparisons you know what's the thing where people like take a thing and they put it into different more familiar terms and then they say this is literally equivalent that's what we did so sail for it's ramen fallacy no oh we should ask grog yeah surely grog will know please ask him in the specific way that makes him answer no or yes um full of straw like a sea turtle or sea turtle man fallacy okay how does vario offer you the stuff for sale now i'm selling premium stars for 1 000 coins what's the scenario after you are done beating vario in the zoo after you chase him out with the chain chomp he stops being a zoo keeper and he enters the overworld where he offers to sell your star for 1 000 coins way overpriced take a straw man and you exchange all the straw is it still a straw man fallacy do you want a star too bad yes one thousand dollars you have to send me real money to my paypal to get the star it will be the secret 201st star for the survival oyster study workaround no you actually genuinely buy the stuff from him what's the save time tb4k for to save all the other romex you may deduct the save time and can that be fixed i'm not sure that's bizarre you're pretty tired what about guns in this game do they have no purple coins oh you mean the yoshi coins i guess some of them are purple uh they give you a star in the level if you collect all of them right i can't just we need a safe block in this overworld hello braham do use the this is why the car is no longer in the safe block so i think we'll need to push Rari a little bit to the left here, like 50 cardamoms so some where's Wario? Where'd Brogo? hmm um that's actually a good question um let's just see where he is he is at minus 32 767 what moved him there okay now he exists and he has no fluttering render which is perfectly reasonable this is why we have this assert now instead of a null pointer check so that all our shadows are going to be forcibly corrected this lets us be not lazy and make sure all the shadows render correctly and vario is still not here where the hell is vario you want to level why are you leveling me okay he is at height minus 31 but where huh i am so confused by this oh oh that would do it that explains everything hey there he is wow damn he's not very talkable but that's fine i know why so he kind of was like flipped yeah okay that seems to work please stop saying it's cape jonah level for nintendo for life he was somewhere else yes awesome this is obviously the biggest he's not at all you need to find out he was his position was where his current x position is that's all i would say i'm not picking up where it is right now vario is worse he should make clear that he's only selling a single star so like so far as where is it pretty funny yeah i like it too zayn i came up with this so make a big sign that has an arrow pointing to him and says only one star now he says last one then i'm sold out there's 1000 coins what do you say you want it sucker so this is going to be what he says for the rest of the game after you buy it every time you come by him and talk to him he says you bought it sucker but he's not the other still there's other willing customers this is a very desirable product obviously there would be other customers willing to buy it so that's a great text file back i will let you just clean up so you want stars huh so i think this one's we're gonna design the list line somewhere maybe it exists in the game but i'm not sure yeah i gave up on the zoo business you want stars huh well you better be quick because this is the only the last one in stock 1000 coins or bust too bad you could use one you look pretty tired wow and then when you do buy it he needs to give you a star i can't believe i forgot that oh so all this running around and still no coins man these are so full of personality i like it um we still still no coins i need coins so i can actually buy from vario did you see the cutscene skip widget i added isn't that cool i'm not collecting 1000 coins f**k that how do i get a thousand coins do i go into optics do you do i i don't so you're making the game okay yeah look i have 2000 coins don't tackle me i found a quick way to do that yeah you have on the zoo business you want the star yes you bought it sucker what if just because vario's an a**hole the star spawns like way way away from where you are like in a completely different place just like f**k it f**k you wow that would be pretty funny i think do as soon as you have a lot of appearances like vario no he's just a zoo you're cheating i'm cheating in my own game no i need more sleep man this is just a shop star like the task here is collecting a thousand coins really you actually get 1000 coins you will easily get a thousand coins while you play this we get the booblar infestation to do as well and we have the ghostly boardwalk let's work on the boardwalk like nap i cannot nap i have a really hard time falling asleep ah that's too much setup i think it's missing the elegance so this is going to be the lighthouse very short section and then there's a switch here and then we have a cutscene from the outside where the lighthouse turns and it's going to open course five see how the spawn is now here forever i love seeing my game work it feels so good to just have your game work as intended so i'm not doing the canon idea wait what's the canon idea did i miss that also just realized one more that i noticed this from here earlier maybe it's not wrong and i was just being stupid what was the canon idea catch me up that was a little bizarre not a fan of that let me just shorten that warp why did i put in a hundred obviously that would lead to issues you can only interface in the lighthouse and you have to aim the lighthouse shiver if it's more alive than a switch oh somehow i missed that idea entirely so hmm that would be very cool but also it would mean we have to model the level completely from this view so just for that one small cutscene there's so much stuff we have to do what what the fuck was that am i in local view where am i so what the fuck was that yeah the problem is look we have to model all of this to look fine i think that's just too much yeah well my plan initially was to have the light like point in this direction and then you press the switch and you see a cutscene ever turning this way and then maybe you'd see it like you go here and you'd see the fog clear up so yeah that it would be cool but the amount of work that is it's just so got that much like if at all reasonable this would only be reasonable at the very end of the game when we have everything freely modeled right otherwise we're having to redo this area over and over and so i'm 100% not programming that right now so yeah if it was right here that would maybe work a little better can't you hear me he's being advertised still guys this is our one shot where we can talk trash about bileback and he will never know and there's no way he's predicting me to say this yes when he comes back just all pretend i made like an epic joke that owned him i mean a good one case lol i need this so that's crazy it's crazy everyone just joined in on that hello dry sylvester did you guys see that all the star world files dropped and apparently a good chunk of it was done too that was what surprised me the most but that's pretty cool star wars you don't know what some of this that's completely fine don't worry about it yeah he he said on twitter i'm gonna die soon here's all the files from my game basically so every night and everything in me i'm not going over the star wars files skallax and me i think we've been on bad terms for a while i don't know i don't really talk about him much i don't know if he still talks about me but because of that i think it's best to like just keep distance in that regard so i'm not going to touch the files or do anything with it to finish that one for him yeah i think he would absolutely hate that he already hated when i made star war star road console compatible the fun's exciting or bad they're level models and stuff like that how many years ago you're supposed to win so i stopped watching yeah he had brain cancer it is the guy who made star road yes you guys didn't know all this wait i'm just telling you guys new information so that's not the compiled game just the files well apparently there is some amount of compiled game in there but obviously there's a lot of crashes and it's unfinished plus halbert who is a mario 64 ds hacker who made like sunshine 64 ds i think i'm not sure if he finished it he said he's gonna finish it so star world might actually become a finished game like in the not too far future so from them like the nasa star multiplayer let's place that's a long time yeah so this is leaking files from every project on this time no he's leaking his own files and it's not leaking he's publishing it you got to make most of what you wanted and then you get his room it's been uncomfortable yeah so where are my transition functions i want to drink out warm i guess we have to drink out warm yeah So, we probably want a special warp here. So, what does this look like? Fade into white, perfect. Fade into black, perfect. That's not at all true. So, what we're probably going to do is, we now have a warp here. This warp is just going to warp Mario to this area here, where half a cutscene plays of the Lighthouse changing direction. And then that's going to warp Mario over here, where the rest of the cutscene plays. And then we're going to warp Mario back into the first area. And we're probably going to just do a hard camera cut here, from here to here, to make it feel even more like an open world. Sounds like a good plan? Yeah, it's just going to be a seamless warp from here to here. I definitely don't want warp 3-7, that was a bad choice. Let's use T-7. You know what, let's T-0. We have some organization. The cutscene warps are going to be the sea warps now. When Mario went to the ship, not a cutscene. Put the fruit or something in the ocean between both beaches, so you can see how both are related to each other. Yeah, that could work. There is going to be fast travel via the map. I'm sorry if you're disappointed by that, but the map is gigantic. I'm just going to put this inside the mountain. And then we need a warp C-2, that goes to Castle Grounds. Area 3, C-3. Maybe because I like the switch. Or at least rotate something in the lighthouse, like a big wheel. You have to push, that feels like you're doing it, and not the mysterious video game forces. The problem I have with that, is that I want the cutscene here, that shows the light moving. And the problem is, if you have a wheel, you think the wheel incrementally moves that, right? So it needs to be a distinct on and off state. But it not being a switch, sounds like a fine idea to me. It's just the way it is not a switch, needs to be workshopped a little bit, in my opinion. You want to aim at the other, I don't think you have to push it far enough. That sounds solid to me. Something like this. Hmm. 298 triangles, I probably have to slightly reduce that, because there's going to be so many. But that's a good start. Yeah, maybe you can upload it somewhere else. I don't know, this happens often, that links just don't look right. It looks fine for you, why does it not look fine for me? Bizarre, actually, bizarre. Four legs and two arms and a giant tongue, which are planes, and some hair things on his hat. Oh, okay, well, that sounds like a lot of detail. I didn't realize he had legs. Hopefully this works. Ah, okay, yeah, I thought you meant something like that. Yeah, I agree, that would probably be a bit better. But let me implement this first, with the cutscenes and everything. What should happen now is if we step on the switch, screen fades to white, and we land on castle grounds, with no cutscene happening. The concept I linked has four legs, what? Wait, am I... Ooooooh. Let's see. Damn, okay, they really do just have four legs. I don't know why I never perceived them. Let me take a look at the level here. How do they actually come across in-game? Where can I see them in-game? Bro, do they even exist in this level? What's going on? Oh, there they are. Ah, okay, in-game it just kinda looks like goop. But it is legs, technically speaking. That makes sense. No, I made clean, I'm stupid. Can I just link goop strands to you? Yeah, but if you look at the concept art, they actually generally are supposed to be legs. What? Ripticon's attack stump has four points. I suppose 300 triangles is fine, if a lot of the time they're just like this little goop. I went to the wrong place. Okay. Aww. Um. It's not anywhere exported. Okay, let's try this again. We have to feed for lower tricons. I think we might have to do that. Honestly, I can have a better idea once I take a look. It's kinda hard for me to tell before I've not seen the model. Is there any way to fix a broken heart? What a song. Yeah, we have a whopping 45, that's nice. Okay. Okay, yeah, I exported past the nodes. That's why it crashed, if that makes sense. This is non-stop Eurobeat mixed for lonely drivers drifting alone. And you are curious. And you are curious. I actually don't understand why my video is doing terrible. This is the same amount as views as usual, with a higher playtime. And it's like the worst doing video ever. What the hell. And in a lonely driver drifting alone, you are a 16-year-old with a League of Legends addiction. True, it does give off that vibe. And it works. Woo! TLB exception. What are we accepting today? Okay. Looks like there's no floor. There is no floor. Well, that was a 100% fail to crash there. Okay. Let's just move Mario off-screen somewhere. Okay. Are there threads? Yes. Yes, we are multi-threading. And after watching the video, it was pretty good. And why is it doing so terribly? See, the worst part is, if this video doesn't hit 120,000 views, the sponsor doesn't pay me. And then this is the one where you just get the worst YouTube RNG of all time? How is this possible? Yes, the original game uses threads. Of course I will allow ports of the mod. I will welcome ports of the mod. I want people to make ports of my mod. You know what? We're just gonna call this overworld. That's the new controller. I usually don't have a strict amount of views to hit, but this one time I do. I encourage people to make memes of the mod. You can do whatever you want with the mod after it's done. Just please, what I don't want you to do is make an enhancement mod that just frustration minimizes it. I would hate that. There needs to be spicy parts, you know? Imagine you make a dish, and there's someone who doesn't like salt. And then there's someone who doesn't like spicy. And then there's someone who doesn't like sweet. And now you accumulate all of these tastes, and you're just left with a fucking nice looking bland piece of garbage. I don't want that to happen. I think that's what AAA gaming is. Ooh, I went against AAA gaming. I'm so brave. Give me the good boy points. Praise me. Sorry. He bravely stands up against the big corporations. He is our man. His name? Ace Emanuel. I'll take up the year. Thank you, Asmongold. The Asmongold take is like, yeah, remove the sucky parts people don't like, but make hot women in the game. I don't know. That's my impression of him. I don't watch him. That's my impression of what he stands for. We need to make AAA games that we can jerk off to. Otherwise, it's a bad game. I don't know. Well, I mean, there's an HP room, then you have to have decaps to grow. Yeah. What? Peach? Sure. Whatever. Want peach. I agree. Oh, you sent me the monogram? I'll take a look at that. It's another monogram you cheated on. He offered some help, yeah? I'm not gonna say no to some help. This isn't cheating. This is, uh... You know, Zayna was making models too. You weren't complaining about Zayna, huh? If I'm cheating with a girl, it's fine. If it's with a guy, it's not. You sexist. I spun it on you, what now? No contact chat sent yet? Oh, okay. Let me take a look real quick then. You're set to 258, nice. Uh, I have both wood paneling and a broadcast location. I have the wood paneling in my broadcast location. Ooh, okay, they look really nice. I like these guys a lot. Oh, I found some triangles we can reduce. Right here. So these, you don't need this. You can just do that. And move them in a little bit, and it looks the same. That's pretty neat, right? What else can we do? You can get these to look slightly rounder. Again, we're doing the 45 degree rotation. The famous case twist. See what I mean? Are there any other triangles we can save realistically? The wrist looks very optimized already. I mean, I guess we could do stuff like this, but this is starting to really be a detriment to the visuals. It feels like the hands are extremely detailed compared to the rest of the model, though, don't they? Am I crazy for thinking that? The hands have like 58 triangles. Hmm. I mean, I guess this is viable, but honestly, this might not even be visible on N64 if we do that. And that's 12 triangles, holy shit. What do you think of this? I mean, this is still symmetrical. I'm actually a little worried about the animation here. Because the triangles need to deform along here. Hmm, the animation might be an issue, like how am I going to animate this? The problem is we only have vertex weights 0 and 1, right? So his hands are kind of going into his body here. Please watch it five more times, because I need 120,000 views, or I'm gonna get fucked. I guess this is possible, too, but it's also a big detriment to the visuals. Looks very good, though. I like it a lot. But the hands rotating animation-wise? I'm not really sure how we are going to resolve that. That's a little bit of a curse problem, I find. So you don't get the views? They don't pay me! They wanted a 120,000 views guarantee, so... Like to play games in your free time? Yeah, right now we're playing Ape's Odyssey. Dude, the games I play are gobbledygook. I only play gobbledygook from now on. I can add edge loops around the arms to give you more deformation when animating? The edge loops need to be in a specific way so that the arms can actually go all the way up and down. Just more wouldn't do it. You know what I mean? Can you try spinning them and see if they clip into the body somehow? You are completely free to use Spongebob. I do not really care if Spongebob gets the views or not. I care that I get the money. Oh yeah, it's a really nice model, for sure. Right, now I need to make the splines. The first spline is just going to look at the lighthouse here. Maybe do a camera rotation like this? Click on the icons on the left side, but remove the file browser instead, so you get more spacer code than clicking in to return them. You mean like this? Listen to the divorce Eurobeat playlist? I put on Jojo Eurobeat and then it just turned into divorce. Zayna told me to put this on. Do you think it's a bad sign? Think she's going to take the fucking kids and leave? The kid rather, we only have one kid. The kid and the fishes and half the RTY. Imagine how fucked up that would be. If in the divorce I had to give up half my repository. Oh my god. I might have to do something illegal. Look at all those red spots. We're working on the cutscene right now. We're working on a cutscene that happens as soon as you press the switch in the lighthouse. And this cutscene is gonna show the lighthouse light shining onto the fog area here. Which will make the fog disappear. Bro is just programming poorly and is proud of it. See, okay, one stupid thing I used to do when I was starting my programming journey in C was... I thought the finds were stupid. I thought, like, okay, just remember the number. Like, obviously that's less typing. Like, why don't you just remember the number? That was not a good choice. So, have you ever asked your team for ideas? I mean, my team is like, a while back in chat right now, in Zayna. And yes, they've got some good ideas. But sometimes on stream I ask for ideas. But it's rare that I just DM them and ask for ideas, I suppose. You put Nebby... Nebby is going to be in the water all around the island. So if you try to swim off the island, he just eats you up and spits you back out. That's the idea. Once we just stop giving ideas, that also happens sometimes. Usually I only ask chat to stop giving ideas if they're giving ideas for a problem that's either not relevant right now, or it's already solved. That happens a lot, actually. Chat loves doing that. Now I'll be your love desire, please don't ever go. Crazy dance and sexy power, all I need is you. Tonight I'll take you higher, if you love me too. I think if I programmed everything right, it should just work now. Incomparable times. Makes sense. This is a question we were working on a while back, can I add the black monster from Super Mario World? I don't remember working on a lava level. But the answer is probably no. But there's a different lava level we're planning, where the lava is rising. And we might add the black level there. Okay. Solid. Not what I wanted at all. I forgot something. Okay. I completely reworked how wops work recently. Because the way wops worked in Mario 64 was dumb. Now they're a lot better. Rising lava level plan? Yeah, inside the volcano. It's like a secret level after you have the block. The worst idea I had recently is getting all excited about state machine and using wops. Everything went half the time like it just happened, you know? I don't know what a state machine is. I mean, I have a vague idea, but I don't really see how it's different from literally just programming. Can I just get out of here in a system? No, no. He can bounce down and you jump on the snoot. And then he goes back up and puts you into it. That was the idea. Okay. How many of these ones are about development? Ask only if you are bad about development. Not an issue for me. I mean, yes, we have somewhat scoped cryptas, but not that bad. We already have four overworld stars now. Isn't that kind of cool? I love seeing the game get together. I've also done so many beta lists now. It's been like 20 beta lists or so. And I've really been enjoying seeing people test my game. Okay, that kind of was a cutscene. Wasn't a good one, but hey, it was arguably a cutscene. Wee! Thank you for watching the channel, Realdobro. Very appreciated. I need the 120,000 views or my sponsor will murder me. So we need the cutscene to be over at the end, obviously. And we need this to actually look good. What can we do here to make the fog look like it's disappearing? What if it's just like a pan over here without the camera really moving? Oh, come on. I forgot. What's the time to get the view count? One month. I was thinking, what if I just buy a Google ad and promote it to like 10,000 Indian people? It's cheap. I noticed. I can hit my view guarantee if I promote my video for around $700 worth. So honestly, I have a backup plan. But I think the sponsor would be very upset with me. I send people the game. I give them no hint at all. My brief is, play this game as you would enjoy it. If you have some thoughts, just say them out loud, but don't do a full let's play. This is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. See, you can either know how a beta tester plays the game, or you can know a beta tester's thoughts. You cannot know both at once. So you have to min-max that a little bit with encouraging them to commentate not too much. Because if they commentate too much, they are going to affect their own playthrough. Who's the sponsor? boot.dev. They are a programming learning website. This is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. You can either know how a beta tester plays the game, or you can know a beta tester's thoughts. If you have some thoughts, just say them out loud, but don't do a full let's play. This is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. You can either know how a beta tester plays the game, or you can know a beta tester's thoughts. Who's the sponsor? boot.dev. This is a cutscene. Kind of. I just can't control it a little bit. That's too long. Why are we watching Mario? What is gravity but a cutscene? True. This is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. You can either know how a beta tester plays the game, or you can know a beta tester's thoughts. Who's the sponsor? boot.dev. This is a cutscene. Kind of. I just can't control it a little bit. What is gravity but a cutscene? True. What if we do something like this, actually? What if we do something like this, actually? What if we do something like this, actually? 7 hour cutscene, true. 7 hour cutscene, true. 7 hour cutscene, true. Oh, we can very easily shorten it, just by changing the B perm on this. I do wonder though, why was this one focusing Mario? That was weird. Wait a second... C3, C4, that's what. No, it would be C2. Wait, no, we want to. 0xC2, is that it? 0xC3, aha. No wait, that doesn't make any sense, it's the source warp. The source warp is the B perm too, of this one here. Which is C2. Does my musical choice always usually end up with this? Do you mean the mountains here? Yes, we're probably gonna place them in a few more places. That's it. This is the end. That's it. This is the end. This is the end. This is the end. This is the end. This is the end. This is the end. This is the end. There's some color bending in there but I think that's on purpose. That's how they're supposed to look like, right? Did I even export the fucking thing? What? Nothing changed. I don't think I exported it. Yeah Jordan, we'll probably do something kinda like that. I mean, I remember Biobank's intro cutscene with the Deadly Workshop. It looks amazing. We'll probably use some shot like that as well. Hello Kotch and Garrett. Okay, that kind of works better. I don't understand, why is this one focusing Mario? That makes no sense. And it also didn't end. Maybe I need to run this when it's at 2. And then maybe this one doesn't need to be fully on the lighthouse. Or rather just before it. So we wanna follow the light beam. That's where the focus should be on. And also we need a new warp hop for this. Wait, this will never work actually. Oh, I should be kept in the cutscene? True, true, true. Why didn't I think of that? Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Let's see if that works. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Let's see. Huh? Okay, that looks like it would follow the lightbeer. Huh? The one frame of Mario I don't like. You know what? I think this might be a little more insane. Like, to just reset the cutscene when we enter an area. Because we probably should be doing that anyway. Alright. I am somewhat optimistic for this. That's where the light would change. Ooh, okay, this is where the fog would disappear. Fuck. Okay, it works. It works. The light isn't very noticeable. The light doesn't exist yet. I am just imagining the light to exist. Okay, we need a safe lag for this anyway. Soft lag? Well, it's an infinite cutscene. But that's fine. That means the cutscene ends. It's all good. We fixed it. Okay. It depends what I thought. I don't actually. But we'll figure something out. Maybe. I don't know. I'm not gonna do it. But I wouldn't be surprised if someone else did. Didn't Lal even make a PC port of this? Oh yeah, you don't even know about this. We imported Buetri's file back. She's part of the game now. She's been made part of the canon. Do you guys think that someday in the future, the word clanker is actually going to be offensive? People use that word a lot right now. I'm thinking maybe I shouldn't use it because I do not want to get cancelled in 2040. Moral has a way of working out in a way where what benefits big companies becomes the Ovilton window or whatever the fuck they call it. I have a feeling you're gonna get cancelled for it in 2040. Hello Blue Nate. Tournaments will cancel you? Yeah. Why did it press it again? Oh, because I'm not calling the edit function? That's why. That will do it. Okay, next we need to make the fog disappear. This needs to be a cutscene thing. Hello Mel. Is that Mel from Mel Super Mario 64 8 megabytes? You know what, we're just gonna get this. Is his heart rate suddenly a little smaller? Processing joke, one second. I don't get it. What happened? Super Mario 8 megabyte. I could not have processed that joke. I had no hope of understanding that one. Alright, let's see it. This part, we still need to import the light ray. Don't worry, we'll do it. Oooh, that's actually kinda sick. I think I like that. We need to give the player a little more time to realise what they're looking at. That's normal, it takes a while to make a Mario 64 hack. Why is the lighter texture like that? Because yesterday, when your mom put your vegetables on your plate and you didn't finish them, that's what happened. You need to assign some event type when playing? Like, true. Play Puzzle Jungle. Experiences you receive when invisible from distance and fades out as you approach it? True. We can still workshop the actual chip graphics. They are a little bit rough right now, admittedly. Like, the black plane looks a bit dumb. It worked better when it was a Z camera and it was made at a time when our engine was not powerful. Well, that seems like something I would be up for the viewer to decide and not me. Very hard for me to say whether I preserved it or not. Which side of the lighters is the one with the white? I don't actually know. There was something really good and fun in Water Level, but that's Nightmare from SketchUp. Yeah? I think I've coloured vertex lighting. Yes? Did you not see me just now do that? All the vertex lighting is coloured. I must be misunderstanding a question. This really is divorcee music, I'm pretty sure. All you know is it's peak. Yeah? I mean, it looks good, but I'm not sure I understand. Is this voice glitching for anyone else? I hope not. I'm aware our engine is not awful. Like, six times on my end it sounded like you were in denial. It's pretty good. I'm aware our engine is not awful. I'm aware our engine is not awful. Our engine is not awful. It's not awful. It's not. No. Our engine is not awful. I'm aware our engine is not awful. I'm aware our engine is not awful. It's not. It's not. I'm a surgeon. Now I have no interest in character quests. I never liked Brodius, Hex, and now that there's a different character, I would think I have even less reason to like them. Do I work in the game industry? Yes, I actually do work with Unreal Engine 5 in my normal job. I am a programmer by trade. Any in-game games you're looking forward to? I'd like a new custom robo game. I'm not sure if they ever announced one. I'd like a good Zelda game again. You know, one that actually works the way you want the Zelda game to work. Other than that, not really. Can I say I still need 3 years working on Proprietary Engine? Oh, Proprietary Engine sounds like a lot more work, but also like it could be a lot better. Getting hired as the leader is kind of sick. Like right away, they want you to be the guy to lead the team. It's pretty cool. Why don't you make the ship of the gods in 3D? Because I cannot do five things at the same time. I have to take it one by one. Do I have the big catch? I have not. I do not know very many video games, that's the thing. I'm very much just like playing whatever I just happen to find. And I usually only play games that are like at least 10 years old. Because I can just emulate them on my consoles. I don't know man, maybe something about Eurobeat just divorces you. Seriously, were you in 3DS games? Well, usually the games I play are even older than that. Right now, we just recently got a PS3, so we're catching up on all the Playstation games we never got to play. Right now I'm playing Abe's Odyssey. Speed is 19 years old? Okay, well, I said at least 10 years. But I do see your point. I played Need for Speed for the first time recently. I tried playing Final Fantasy VII and I didn't like it. Yes, Oddworld. Abe's Odyssey from Oddworld. That's the game I'm playing right now. I played the original Final Fantasy 7. I got... I think I was told I got like halfway through. I mean I guess I can spoil the game, right? Like no one cares about spoilers for this game, like everyone's already played it except for me. I got to the point where there's like the cutscene where the planets move along or something and Sephiroth's just like yapping. And then I kinda quit. I just couldn't take it anymore, man. So much RPG bullshit in the game where it's like, here's the same fight, do it 15 times. Okay, that's a start, but it's bad. Why are we watching Harry Potter's biggest plot hole's brackets open even more? Where's my Divorcee music? Okay, we need a new OST. This one is fucked up. You ever play Animal Crossing? No, but I played Harvest Moon and I know I don't like that style of game. Final Fantasy 7 is not great. What you mean use your strongest move unless you are low HP then heal is not great gameplay? I would love to do that for 40 hours against random encounters. What about Final Fantasy 0? Do you like JRPGs? No. In some of the modern Final Fantasy 7 ports, they actually give you the option to unlock random encounters. So they just give me the option to not really engage with the game. I mean, the random encounters is like one and a half the game, like what? But I'm even playing at that point. That wasn't very great. Yeah, the encounter rate is really, really annoying. Yeah, there are some JRPGs that I like despite being JRPGs, I would say. I've played one of the Mario RPGs, other than the Paper Mario ones, and it was okay, I think. I wouldn't have played it, but I was sleeping over somewhere and it was really boring, so I beat it. Okay, that's like decent now, but it's not great. Why is this in Bouncy Flower? I think we got kind of screwed by ploving the curses here. But when you start working on your character, have you planned to make it seem like an official later N64 game? Not when I started, but now I do, yes. Paper Mario 64 is pretty good too. Let's get a bit of a smoother animation here. Edgy the Hedgy, let's go! It's the material system, you can see that Paper Mario just took after it. I used the material system a little bit, but I didn't think it was a big part of the game when I played it. Okay, that's kind of clean now. I think we should sync the jingle to be here instead, after the cutscene. I think that will have a different vibe. That makes sense, but I never got that far in the game, because I got bored of it before. So I need to say, you should also be able to bring the black cutscene from the original scene change, black bar. Oh, it retriggers. Is that timed well? No, that's timed poorly. This takes too long. Where's the black bars? Black bar code is somewhere around here. I hate when code does that. Or that. Same timeout plus time accumulated. So we can just set time accumulated to something big here. We need some way to actually do this correctly. Let's do some flags here. Let's do that. I know that's very specific, but it's okay. Oh, it's a nice number. Black, true. Wait, what? Remake? Oh, no, no, no, definitely not. That's why I played the original, because the original is a classic. I assumed that the remake is probably not the same experience. Oh, there's something interesting about how they do it. Could use this here to make the alpha distance loop smoother. STF. The answer is probably yes. Oh yeah, we use something similar to this. It's in some levels. Yeah, you would see this on the Bob-ombs, actually. I'm making a video on the Bob-ombs going live next Saturday, and you will see exactly that. You need to watch that video on the Bob-ombs. I think it's exactly that. I don't know if it is, actually, but I think it is. Oh, yeah, then there really wouldn't have been a point in playing the remake, right? Like, I played it specifically because it's a classic. The remake is just a completely different game, but it would have been the point. Where did Black Rust come from? I didn't see it. Hey, it's perfect! Oh, that's actually beautiful. I think we did it, guys. I think the only change I want is right here to focus. I want the focus to shoot forward here, and then cut, kinda. Does that make sense? I don't actually know how to do that. I love being the me. And then we believe the light is red and the scene change is a little too long. Fair enough. Let me take a look at this with the camera jutting forward, if it's better now. They're going to cast the secret stars in the overworld. The overworld has tons of secrets. I think something like 40 secret stars now at this point. 35, 30, something like that. Solid. Yeah, there's the island's secret stars. Okay, well, that's not good. Is Mario 64 relevant? Dude, Mario 64's dynamic music? I wanna make a video about this, too. The entire stream that you're seeing right now is the music sequence that is possible in Mario 64. Like, just the entire video. That's a valid music sequence in Mario 64. Deathwizette programs Tetris as a music sequence in Mario 64. So, yes, music sequences can do whatever you want them to do. The entire program of Chat GPT is a valid Mario 64 sequence. That was kind of... okay, that kind of worked, right? Do you see that? I can't tell if this is horrible or great. Yeah, it's Turing Complete. Guys, this is awful or great? Is the music coming? Yeah, the music is going to be different, obviously. We still need to import the music here first. The way the music in the overworld is going to work is that each part has a separate sequence and they all fade into each other as you go between them. And hopefully they start at the same point, too. So there is like a ghost version of this theme here that Badoop has sent me at some point. Good, but it's kind of abrupt. Well, I mean, it has to be abrupt, right? There's a camera cut. All right, I think the cutscene is done. I do want to use Biobank's idea of actually rotating the thing, because I think it actually is a lot better than what we have right now. Just because it feels like you're actually doing something. And then after that, we can move on to the Boobla infestation. My favorite track on the OSD is Wild Variant 17. I think there's only 12 variations, but yes. He does let up on all the levels are really dynamic. Anyway, it is time to end today's stream. So I will see you next stream, whenever that may be, probably on Tuesday. Bye-bye.
