No, game... That is wrong. Hello, Parker. Hello, Selton. Final stretch? No. I mean, it depends on what you define final stretch to mean. Last course demo soon. Nope, we are getting 15 courses. Only one viewer. Bro fell off. You fell off. No. Let me think about this. Bro had one minute to think over this. And that is the best he could come up with. Shakwisha Jonalanisha fell off. That is not your real name. Game is nearly finished. We are getting there. It is not a casino. It is an arcade. But yes, it is time. The lag. Hello, I am your cat. Hi, sir. A German version of the joker meme yesterday. Warum so ernst? Hahaha. Warum so ernst? Hahaha.    It is not your real name. Haha. Haha. Haha. Haha. Haha. Haha. Haha. Haha. Haha. Haha.  I had an idea that is so good. You will love it. I have to do this. You will see this and shit your pants. If this idea works. You can go inside. I don't think you will be able to go inside. There is going to be. That thing. Exactly. That is why it is such a good level idea. This is the best idea. I think I told you guys. There was a guy that wanted to give us better internet. He wanted to give us the same Internet for cheaper. I said all right. The next day, they already came by. They had everything set up. The same day.  The Internet was worse. This sucks. I'm not signing the contract. The guy wanted me to sign the contract. I'm not agreeing to anything until I see the contract. I'm not signing shit. The next day, they installed it before I signed the contract. Now, they have dropped their router into our basement. Now, we have the router. I haven't signed the contract. I'm not paying for that. Go pick it up, idiot. That's what you get for lying. Oh, what's going on right? Hello, how you doing? What can I do? Oh, what's going on?    Hello.    So funny old guy. I mean, I didn't sign anything. So now he just kind of wasted his time and I'm not paying for that shit. So jokes on him, I guess. So this room is finishing. Obviously my roaming, my own ranks are always getting finished. The fuck you mean? You want to fight? I will fight you. Sorry. I lost it. A little bit. Got a little rowdy. Okay.                 He's famous for canceling eggs all the time. True. You remember when case gets canceled? Star Road to case. That's fine. Lena. I don't want to accidentally kill you. How is the school gang galleon? I'm on the wrong overworld. I did a bunch of fixes yesterday and I did some cool stuff, but I forgot what I did. So I can't show you guys. You just have to trust me that I did something cool. I overhauled Mario's animation system. Mario's animations are now much more consistent, which you can't see because that's in the code. Oh, we already have the music in. I got to bring the thing back. Yeah. Shitting pan. What? Yeah. So this will be the general aesthetic of this whole level. We're going to have a big rocket in the middle. This is Spiralbacks idea. A giant rocket that's the casino. I'm thinking inside the rocket. Okay. This is a cool idea I had. For the inside of the rocket, there's going to be like a spiral thing that goes up. That's a time for the main part. And then it's going to be rooms inside the rockets with a black hole at the bottom. And this is like platforming over a void. And I think it's going to look really cool. And I think that's how we're going to make the platforming work. Look at the crunch. I don't see it, Lila. Wait. Are all my final levels set in space? No, no, no, no, no, no. Holly, you're forgetting Mario 64 Madness. The final level in Mario 64 Madness is... I don't know, but it's not in space. All right. Any OST wishes? Liam song. I don't know what that is and we're not doing it. Origami King. Let's do it. All right. So this is a crazy idea. But hear me out. That's not the idea. Give me a second. Okay, so. We have this. We duplicate it. We remove one part. We remove the outside. We unhide this. We. Duplicate the material. Apply this. Wait. Apply this. Now. Move it to layer five. Shade color alpha. I swear it might look like you know what's going to come, but you have no idea what's going to come. It's going to be great. No in between. Okay. It's not quite what I wanted. But you get the idea, right? Yeah. Sounds like you had a good day, Lila. I think. Why is the difference so much? Oh, this is why. Okay, guys. False alarm. False alarm.  What you just saw is invalid. That's not what I made. Make it like this. I think that was my intention. It's kind of like what I wanted. Move the thing. Wait, this is the thing I can move. Oh, I thought it was an image. I can make this, but it's not quite the idea that I had. Maybe I can't make this. What the hell is this part? I mean, this looks doable, but I don't think it's quite what I wanted. I don't know how to make it not render for geometry is the issue. Pff. What's the plan here? Actually, additive color, basically. So it would be like a thing that adds color to everything. I'm thinking if maybe I can use like a model matrix to reduce the depth by some percentage. Hmm. Hello, Cadx. All the flying stuff is actually from a while ago when I made a competition hack. I think I'm going to keep most of it, though. I don't know. Something about the color palette here just doesn't feel right to me. Let's see. And rendering for geometry. Actually, I don't know if I hate or like this. Do I like it rendering for geometry? It's kind of weird. Blue and purple and everywhere. Bears are blue everywhere. Hmm. I made a little guess. Well, I mean, it renders above everything, though. Like even if I put Aria above it. It's kind of cool. It's kind of ass. Is there a better way to render an effect like this, maybe? Yeah. Maybe that's not the right idea here. What if. What if. What if we do that? It's still going to be additive with everything below it. I don't think it's going to look continuous now, though. No, the hub world is not complete. The hub world happens at the end. I mean, that now just looks like it's a half hour, right?  Can make some shortcuts using the Z-Wave to mask it. I don't see how that's cheaply doable. So I've also been thinking about what we have in the level here. I've laid out six stars. So star one would just be on top of the arcade, right? There's this whole rocket. You can do the climbing section inside the rocket. Should be fine. Star two I'm thinking is a game machine. You platform to this game machine that teleports you to a whack-a-mole arcade game and you just whack-a-mole. Three is also a game machine. You platform to. Then there's a rhythm game at the end of it. Four. This one I like a lot. That would be a skidball game setup. If you don't know what skidball is, it's like there's holes of varying sizes and you have to hit the middle. And you're going to shoot a cannon into it. And if you land in the middle, you go to the slide area. The red coins. There's going to be a pinball in space. You cannot stop me here. But this time it's different. This time it's not like a slidey pinball. It's pieces of a pinball machine acting as like platforms to jump around on. Half as obstacles, half as things to make you go further. You know the Casino Nights level in Sonic. That's what I'm thinking. And star six, of course, is a bit pipe. And I'm thinking this last bit pipe, this was Arthur Tilley's idea, it takes you to Mario 64. And we're going to make very short sections of a bunch of Mario 64 levels. And I think the contrast between Mario 64 levels and RTYI levels is going to be beautiful at display here. There is going to be three Yoshi stars per main level, which are like green stars in our galaxy. Can I have a transitional level? I don't understand what that means. No, no, no, no. That makes the contrast weaker. There's also a bunch of other arcade games for Yoshi coins. I actually have too many ideas for this level. Arcade Machine in the Gates, a dumbed down version of Star Fox 64, where it's just like And then Biobak's window idea, a hit the lights type game. Like this, but with Mario. Simon says, I think this one sucks. Scam Machine. This one might also suck. Walk over pixel art to turn on all the pixels. I want that for sure. That's like 100% going to be there. Path where a bunch of lights are on at first and then turn off. Go over. OK, it's like a path where you have to remember the path. Sounds as great what you mean, but not with Mario. I think it would be better as a secret level rather than main course mission, since the levels are so ugly. We can make them look pretty. Mario 64 levels, if we had like a proper big light direction and a color palette, I think it would work. Like Bob-omb Battlefield doesn't have to be god ugly. No, not remade SM64 levels, but chunks referencing parts of Mario 64 levels. So there's going to be like a Bob-omb Battlefield section where maybe like you have the initial walk on the grass and then the bridge and then maybe like a small piece of a spiral mountain. And then you have the next section, which one did I have written down here? Jolly Roger Bay, where maybe there's like a Jolly Roger Bay-esque cave and you have to walk across the cave somehow. You know, a cool mountain where it's like, you know, just like small pieces of the levels. Of course, they're not like exactly the Mario 64 style. We're going to like make proper lighting, I think. Like a combined diorama of all the levels, yeah. Like fragments of SM64 levels floating around, kind of. So we'll make it weekend because I feel like the target audience is people who grew up with SM64, so we'll make a stage in the original art style. We might just like switch in the brain to, oh, I'm not playing the heck anymore, I'm playing as maybe a tiny user and don't set up. I think you're misunderstanding the goal. Don't worry about it. I have a plan. We make it pretty and won't be Mario 64. It can still be like the art style of Mario 64, just like prettier, like. It's like a Bow and Metal Field. Like we would use the textures from here, but we wouldn't have this texture repeat 24 times in one screenshot or in this ugly wall here, not tile or the floor, not tile or like, you know what I mean? No, I think Mario 64 can be looking pretty. And it can definitely be fun. And I picked all the unique level themes, right? Shifting Sand Land and also Quokka Mountain and Snowman's Land.         Are not both going to be there because there's a lot of duplicates in Mario 64. Same with like Tiny Huge Island. We don't need that. It's not really a retro section. I think it counts as a retro. And it's also like the last course, right? Throwing you back to the original Mario 64 has something about it. That works really well for me. Let's play for this course, Space Arcade. I mean, OK, the thing is, if it's not Mario 64, it has to be Dr. Mario. And I think, no, Mario 64 is just way better. What do you think? This is a great idea. I'm just not convinced about it being a retro game.            In main course, I'm seeing it more as a side course. I see what you mean. And but like, I kind of like that all the references that are like big references of old Mario games are contained within the bit pipes. I don't want them to like bleed into the rest of the game. Bring in our game in the retro sections, it would fit. We have the Mario Bros. Arcade game in like course seven, but that's really not fitting for course 15. No, it's fitting. I mean, we have other games from a similar time period, right? Mario 64 is like 96. I'm sure we are referencing games from like 94. We have Donkey Kong 94. Wait, did we not? Maybe we don't have Donkey Kong 94. But we have other games from around that time. What did Mario Bros. 3 release? Mario Bros. 3, I think. 88, OK, never mind. I was going to Google Mario Bros. 2 release date. Clearly, that's not it. But surely we have some newer games, right? Mario World? 1990 RPG? 2023? 96, OK, that's basically the same year, 64. Either way, so for the main area. And of course, Biobike's Rocket Space Arcade. This is something I do all the time. I know, but I like it a lot. Pixel arts of character that light up with scrolling textures, right? You've seen this in Rainbow Road and Lost and Back. I'm going to make a better version of that. I want to have slides to get around the level. I want to have big CRTs around the level. That show a GIF of a video, like a commercial. And flickering and stuff. And you will be able to walk on the CRTs. Now I know that sounds like a crazy idea. But I think you need to have crazy ideas. Galactic slides, the fuck, I don't know what that means. Moonrock platforms. I was thinking Rainbow Road-esque platforms with bloom. Like what I tried to do here, but it looked bad. So maybe not. I think we might have to remove this. Hello, pretty cool crocodile. Yeah, the main part that I'm questioning here is. What are you going to walk on all the time? Meteor trails. We can't just have the entire level with meteor trails. We can't just have the entire level be spinning on meteor trails. Or well, I could. But is that a good idea? Do we have the entire level be permanently spinning? I think I'll pass on that one. Man, this is such a difficult level to map out. I don't think I ever had so much difficulty with it. I think my main problem is that I don't like the color palette we have. The color palette is just kind of poopy. Ugly arcade carpet. Interesting. I definitely think the sky needs to be darker. I think that might help a lot. Yeah, okay. I can see this especially because we want the background to actually be like a background, right? I'll just multiply with grey the whole thing. That already seems way nicer. I don't know. Oh. Alright, this is going to make all the glowing effects look way better. Wait. I'm not even properly in the camera. What is going on? Oh, right. I think this is what Oricami King likes to do. The dancing parts. Okay, this makes the colors a lot easier to imagine. Arcade carpet looks... Well, we can definitely have that in the arcades. Right. I can note that down here. Ugly arcade carpets. Okay. Maybe I should start with mapping out what the rocket is going to be like size-wise. Mario Kart 8 Rainbow Road? Let's see that. Didn't Mario Kart 7 have a really cool Rainbow Road? And Mario Kart Double Dash 2? This feels so dull. This is like how you perceive the world when you're a kid and this is how you perceive the world when you're 40. You know what I mean? Wait the music stopped.    Here's a really nice cover with black text.. Gameplay is amazing.  Watch this in a lower resolution.     Niceấyy. This is a really nice cover.  I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I'm a fucking genius. If you could describe one course, which one would it be? You can just do the math on Batman, just type it in there. I did it in my head, alright? I couldn't resist. But yes, you're right, I should have done that.  No bomb cap? You want a bomb, Candice? I was thinking the cloud cap in this. How did you get the bomb cap? The bomb cap level? Oh shit, you're right! I forgot! Yes, okay, I'm exploiting it one more time and then we're doing the bomb cap level. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. This feels like an appropriately sized casino rocket. If I had a rocket in space that was full of an arcade, I would make it this size. Alright, let's do the bomb cap. Ummm... There we go. Yeah. Rainbow Road honestly sucks in the first game. Which would be... Netmarble Kart? We do have a bomb cap level, but Biomech Reward. Thanks for watching! Oh, this is already a sick texture I'm seeing. Let's see what we've got. All right. General. Fine. Update the lighting. Textures and some geo. Remove wall pillars. Wall pillars. I forgot what I did there. Remove most wall gears because I forgot they were there when modeling and didn't leave enough room. LMAO. My Dendamagia looks too empty. All right. Move graffiti around. There's an absolute garbage topology in there for lighting reasons and somehow it's still 2,000 fewer polygons. Saved one material. One material. All right. Let's see. Starting platform now goes all the way. Oh, okay. This is where we start. Never mind. This is what I wanted to do. Oh, I see you added this to like make people see that they're going to have to go all the way back. Interesting. Nice. A little bit from the start. Good idea. And it's important to be noticed. Slow platform and all of them going forward. What was that? I'm waiting for the alert. I think he forgot to light this one. Am I going crazy? This is supposed to be fully bright. Thank you for the 11 Davy. This is a bug, right? Okay. That's a bug. I will fix it. Do not worry. It should be fine, right? Let's go for 15 steam. It's a space arcade. Square pillars are now round. All right. I kind of like it. Toxic vent now as a whole thing and all of them going forward as a whole thing. Oh, interesting. Did you add a toxic case hitbox here or did I? Did I really make them work by a toxic case hitboxes? No way, right? Maybe I did. Okay. Interesting. All right, room to pipes. Pipe platforms. Now a catwalk. Okay. Yeah, that's much better. I like the catwalk a lot. Change treadmill platforming section. The Alexa track is going from nowhere to nowhere. So now there are three pipes running, dropping bombs on three treadmills. The bombs drop into pipes at the end, probably an important step in a bomb manufacturing process. Replace the part of the platforms on the second part with another catwalk. Oh yeah, this is an important part of the bomb manufacturing process. You are absolutely right. Yeah, that's much better. The bomb producer probably goes in there then. Whoops. There's obviously got to be some kind of gravity management gimmick in there somewhere. What ideas are for that? Low gravity zones. I'm thinking like a box with like green things going up. And then when you're in the box, your gravity is going to be halved. All right, looks good, looks good. I like that. Nice. The light was already there. Good. Good. I like that. Seven segment counter in the center. Displays time left before door opens. Good idea, good idea. Can we animate by scrolling text from your Vs? Okay, I will note that down on my to-do list. To-do, collision, and animate seven segment counter three. Could work, Davey, but I don't think I want to go that complicated. All right. And this is such a cool looking thing here with the half thing. Oh my God, that's so good. Lighting looks great, yep. Oh, I forgot about the bombable wall objects we have here. The bombable walls go so hard. Something like this. Yeah, it's very similar to that. I was thinking of like having it be green and like four lines, but it's the same idea. Room four. Remove the cranes. Fuck cranes. I hate modeling them. Fair enough. They're not a much easier to model. Things sliding on rails on the ceiling. Interesting. So there's going to be things sliding.  Let me know that there are things sliding on rails on the ceiling. Okay. I'm a bit worried that the waiting time here is going to be very long. Yeah, fair enough. I imagine the animation of them was weird. Having the granule to be a variable instead of hardcoded, actually increased the complexity. It wouldn't increase the workload, but it would be more confusing to the player because they'd have to get used to so many different gravities. It's just still the same rotating cranes and codes, they just. Huh? I don't know what that means, because what is my memory of this? I'm trying to remember. Oh, wait. It was like ropes on the ceiling, right? Like a crane with like a rope that moved. Oh. I see. We'll figure it out when we get there. Uh-huh. Okay. I'll have to figure out what the idea here is, actually. Let me look at the other blend file to get a better idea. Is it this one? So this is just going to be coming through the hole and sliding here? Isn't that going to look weird coming out of the hole? I mean, I guess it's fine, or I can animate it to look like the rope is just kind of flinging like a grandfather clock. But that would be weird to interact with. Okay, it's doing 90 degree rotation. Now it's actually doing the same thing, but they look like they're sliding on the rail. They don't do the whole path. Oh, so it's like... Okay, got it. We can do that.  The year's lighting now matching with the light from the windows was pissing me off, so I thought, what if the ceiling was the light source? You know what? It looks great, and I agree. The ceiling is a light source. All right. I can add in code that there's a strong overhead light here. No problem. Okay. I'll add that to my to-do list. Add strong light in the lighting ceiling room. So I have to remove the window lights here, because there's no more window lights. But yeah, that's a very good point. When there's so many differently lit objects in a room, we should think about a way to make the lighting more consistent across the whole room. Very much agree with that. Here's now F-Pillars. Oh, they didn't have that before? Okay, yeah, that was really bad then. Yeah, I think we're fine with just one, maybe. It will allow us enough new platforming tricks to not require more than one, right? In the end, you want to add mechanics to present interesting concepts to the player, not just for the sake of adding more mechanics. Why aren't you listening to me? Because you're asking a stupid, annoying question like 15 times. If I ignore you the first time, I'm not going to not ignore you the next 15 times. People even answered you in chat already. Why do you need me to answer as well? Be real with me. Room 6, evil-ass lighting. All right, I like this. I can add the evil lighting as well. And evil lighting to red room. I can add dynamic light sources so that Mario gets bright and dark as he walks by. Light lamp on light room 10. Zero for a cool effect. All the trees with these textures. Like, let me take a look here. Hickey? Is that an insult? Ooh, ooh, look at that. Oh, that's sick. Replaced a few platforms with metal cubes. Metal cubes, all right. Oh, right, the cannons. Nice cubes, nice cubes. Removed one cannon from the top because it was a bit hard with all the bomb spam. All right, that's fair. Yes, there's tons of minigames in the daily. Most of them are from Yoshi coins. Some of them are from stars. But right now we're actually working on the bomb spam rework because change of plans. It happens sometimes. What is this? A bomb cannon. You wanted to remove this or you wanted to keep this? Seven pipes on the ceiling. Ooh. Ooh. Big firewall for the coming back from the red coin zone. Okay, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Catches you if you fail. That shouldn't be a difficult part of the level. Now it's only one. Okay, I see. And you can aim for above the cannon and have the floor behind get you. But you can't see that from inside the cannon. Ah, yeah, true. I mean, even if you could see that, I think it's fair enough to have this here. Because the way I think of it, it's like this is an element that looks good to add. It has a gameplay functionality. So that's like perfect. A lot of the time it's like if you can think of a gameplay functionality you need and have that inspire something you add to the level and make the level look better too. That's just how I feel about it. It makes it feel better as well. All right. That looks a lot better than the trash texture I had before. And it blocks the pile. Nice. Hole in the wall for disposal. Oh, that makes a lot of sense. I do like it. Yeah, I'll give you coins. That's a very cool hidden area. How big are coin formations? Does anyone know by heart? I don't actually. The light of the first room in the. Oh, I see. Yeah, that's a pretty cool effect. Very fitting. Okay. Zero is 160. Minus two zero one two three four three twenty. Multiply by two six hundred forty. There's no way 640 is right. Oh, well. No, we don't make references to other games, except for the retro sections. Room nine. Update this numbers. Now one material down from six. Okay, this is. Do you want it to look like this? This doesn't feel like what you would want. You know what I mean? I think what you wanted was. Something like this. Am I right? Let me know if I'm wrong.  I will trust your judgment. Okay. The problem is these are going to render us. And that's going to do some flickering. So. I'm going to change this a little bit. It looks a little wrong in blender, but I think it will be fine in game. Is this what everyone calls the wise guy decals? Okay. Why is it doing the center? I don't get it. Oh, well. I think this is what everyone calls voice candy cards. Is it again? You can do cutout decal. It's just not a default render mode. I'm trying to make a cutout decal right now. Let me check that. I got this right. I think if I just control F wise guy decal, I'll find that. It's text edge decals. Dude, why are these fucking idiots talking about wise guy decals all of the time? But no one's actually posting what it is. Surely it's exactly what I have here, right? Yeah, I'm just gonna assume so. All right. They're transparent decals, but I think they look better as cutouts. Okay. That's what you said. This is the lighting. We almost had a Paper Mario retro section, but then decided for Mario paint. What would the crane game idea actually be? What would the idea be? To take some infinite renewable collectible today. One of regards is a star. Oh, I mean, that's easy to do, but I don't think it'd be fun. Because we want the game to be revolving around Mario. Now a cooler, more imposing room for the switch. All right. Had some space left on the numbers texture, so I had a little bomb. And Kilroy was here kind of graffiti. Kilroy? Who's Kilroy? Oh, all right. Yeah, I started with the bombs. It's a good one. And there's a pipe to take you back at the start. Okay. I don't think I won. Want that. The idea was that this level would be playable both backwards and forwards. So the pipe takes you back to the star. Actually, if you get all... No, you can't get all the reds right away, right? You'd kinda just play the level twice. Read the rest. The pipe should be closed. Pipelock.blend. If this is both the first visit and the switch has been pressed this visit. This way, if you just reached and pressed the switch, you have no choice but to do the level backwards. You came back to the level with the camp already unlocked. You've collected the cards on your way up. Yeah, okay, fair. I like it then. Do we block the pipe or do we just not show the pipe? If it's blocked, I feel like players think this is the bomb cap tutorial and they want to open it. Do you know what I mean? Now that I think about it, we should have a bomb cap tutorial in here right away. We don't really have that. What if I just make a door appear here? Yeah, I'll just add that for room 10. Make a bombable door appear in room 10 so you can't leave without blowing it up. Pressing the level backwards, yes. But also, I want the player to immediately figure out that the bomb can blow stuff up. And I'm sure this is obvious. Can she apply it to ball shaving All right, so what I was saying is, yes, I'm sure going backwards would also work as a tutorial. And I think it's blatantly obvious what the bomb cap does. But I still want the player to get the immediate feedback of like, okay, I can blow up walls now. So that's why I'm just going to put up a wall here, right? It's going to cost like one second of playtime. Doesn't cost much of death time. I think it's valuable enough to put it in there. Let's check out the level in game. Am I insane? What is going on? How's the level called? It's just going to level kill us all. I'm going to lose it. It's not necessarily about what's fun, but rather what's consistent with the rest of the game. If something is so different from the rest of the game, then like, you're going to limit the amount of players that enjoy your game, I guess. I mean, some variety is important, but like, don't just go crazy for no reason. So this is the old collision map. I'm going to have to get rid of it. Oh fuck, I got rid of Biobak's level. Biobak, can you do it again? Kidding. Um, this is a lot of triangles. We might not be able to load into the level. Unless I add an exception here to make the collision map bigger. Should I try to send you to the original level? Yes. The problem is the collision map. The engine by default can only handle like, I think like 5,000 collisions in the collision map. And because I haven't made a collision map yet, it's like 8,000 almost? Interesting. That is what I meant. Let me take a look. Oh. Yeah, that does not look like how you wanted it to look. I can probably fix it. It's also going the wrong direction. Okay, that's way too many bombs. Way too many. That's probably why it crashed. I'm going to add randomness to it. Yeah, okay, that's what I did. No biomech, so we got it. We are in sync here. Oh, they also don't disappear right now, I think. Or do they? No, they should disappear if they fall in there. Do you think it's difficult? Nope, I don't think it is. Hello, the official ham. Can you imagine platforming around a giant crane game would really be that different from the rest of the game, would it? No, I mean, I thought you meant like controlling the crane. There is a plan to make it so that there is a big crane game that you're platforming around. It's actually on my list. Although it would mostly be like moving platforms and then you jump on that. All right, what happens here? Okay, nice. They do disappear. Bro is producing. Gonna have to slightly increase the speed, though. Yeah, I think a lot of this jank would go if we had a collision map. Let's find the correct treadmill speeds. Bro is making R64, too. Dude. All right, we're gonna have to disable a few actors just for the time being. I don't think this will actually change anything, but we'll see. Where's the BMR, Sarge? I think this will not have impacted the crashes at all. Because it is collision. I think. Yeah, we need this to be even faster. That was wild looking. Yeah, it is definitely collision. Maybe we need to make a collision map first before we do anything else. Not even a big collision map, just like a little bit of a start of a collision map. Okay. Something in the auto-scroller section, Davey. Those are really hard to make popular. There we go. All right. These are actual 3D objects. What's the problem wearing those headphones there before writing? They're kind of cool looking. I don't know. Those are like, yeah, we love working here. You know what I mean? We love being produced here. They got all their shit here. They're like with the coolest. I fucking love Bob-ombs. I love exploding. Goddamn, it would suck to not be a Bob-omb. That's what they would say to you. I'm pretty sure. Okay, just removing vertices that are like adjacent. Save 2,000 triangles. So there's 2,000 triangles in this level that are just used for lighting. Did you see the Delfino Plaza video I uploaded today? There was like 12,000 triangles.  How is it still crashing? I don't even know what the code is at this point. I don't think particle overflow can happen. Okay. He said this wall here is fucked. Oh, because he used the cycle mode without enabling two cycles. There we go. This is a good material. It seems like they have fun doing it. In Origami King, there was like a suicide mission, right? And then he came back? Was that what happens? Did Bobby die in Origami King? I don't remember. What if they had like one strong explosion and a weak explosion and the strong one kills them? Oh, that made it so much worse. The hell? Something's wrong with this material. I4, I4 seems fine. Six and wait. That's probably it. How to run systematic code to develop 3D games. Well, you're not going to be able to do it with high school math. But I think if you took like one university lecture on linear algebra and you were like really smart, you would be able to do it. Well, yeah, I wasn't trying to give you tips on how to do it. I was just giving you an estimate of how advanced math for a 3D game is. Hmm. Surely the alpha is just one, right? Yeah, I'm unclear on what else the issue with this wall could be unless there's some kind of texture animation going on. There's not. It's funny moving into an apartment with a fucking dishwasher If I had to guess I would say you Am I right is it you You Yes, nice never seen someone be so happy about a dishwasher Well deserved to GG you've beaten life You Nope the wall is still fucked You Not ours umbrella and parallel doesn't work for shit and RS is very annoying to use That's why If parallel worked at all, I would maybe consider using it I Can't find my games on it. It keeps having 15 fucking pop-ups whenever I open it. What's not wrong with parallel? All right, this looks very cool You You can still do this Just gonna print FD mugging I hear that print to the screen like if it's something easy and if it's something complicated I just look at the assembly You Hello Tanya, this is a rework. Yes And there's something wrong with the wall and I don't know why I Saw I feel sonic adventure to you interesting That makes my airplane of paper that was so long ago I RS used to also not boot my game, but I talked to an RS developer and He told me why RS can boot it There was like an inaccuracy and RS that was being detected and making my game launch in like emulator mode Which caused the crash because ours was accurate enough to not run and emulate my thoughts So I avoided that inaccuracy and just main boot into n64 mode if that inaccuracy is present anyway The thing is I have to boot into emulator mode on emulator because emulators are not accurate enough to actually emulate my game But then like some emulators are accurate enough to emulate my game But not but too accurate to emulate in emulator mode, but also not good enough to not be detected as emulator So that's a fucked up thing But with parallel it doesn't matter what mode I bought it into it always crashes When I debugged it I I looked at an old build of parallel and it turns out I thought it was crashing my ROM, but it turns out it just needs around two minutes to boot it Which is also not great We just do it to an inaccuracy that parallel on purpose introduces to make ROMs run faster It's like what am I supposed to do? Clearly the thing has inaccuracies in there on purpose and I'm guessing one of those inaccuracies is what makes my game crash It is depressing Parallel launcher the parallel RDP plugin works, but only in RS and in emu it doesn't work in parallel launcher I think project 64 just ignores it on purpose I Can this texture be so messed up Is it because this was set to clam what does that even do Oh Wait, I see Then it's on purpose Yeah, this is a really cool-looking texture I don't see an issue with it What I'm in the government project 64 I'm open Well, I'm personally just using project 64 1.6, but I wouldn't recommend that I think Rosalie's Lupine going or whatever. It's called. It's very good. That is this emulator here Feel I'm gonna I can just boot my ROM here Never mind it can't but it is good. I promise But I know I've booted my ROM on it before all right, I know it works somehow I think I might just have to detect this one as in 64. Well instead of emulator And then switch to plug-in effect like an embedded works as well like By them all this work I Think the crash just there's already 64's fault Oh Yeah, it works I can't play my game and it looks good too So it even has to render back from before and this thing here looks back to which I think actually is in the model Let's check. This isn't a model It is see it just helped me find a buck Also, but yeah Leela it's a buck It's a new video starting a bunch of stage that reminds me of if you wanted to see it yourself This has to be reminding you of like the egg escape stage, right Final like yeah That's what I thought it'd be I Am really good at Sonic 1 2 1 I've played that game quite a few times Classical music is a gentleman thing. I disagree Okay, I have to I have to pull out a few hot takes here I Think listen to classical music. It's not like an intelligent person thing. I think that's the Identity thing someone who wants to identify as intelligent. He's gonna listen to classical music also Making your bet is not a productive people thing. That's also an identity thing That's the thing for people that want to feel productive. Actually, I think making that is a sign that you're an unproductive person Decoupled from the whole identifying as productive thing like sure she identifies productive. It's very likely You're also gonna be more productive. You're gonna be like putting more effort in being productive, but in the act of making your bet yourself That is unproductive you're wasting time of your day to make the bed worse You identify as yourself go ahead I Have no idea what's going on with this thing. This is so weird My mom makes my bed Zaina sometimes makes the bed and every time she makes the bed is like you made it worse What now I can't play around in a bed anymore and when I wanted to get under the blanket I have to pull it up first this sucks I Don't know at this point I'm thinking the tool is probably mugged Cuz I think there's no way this should be happening by everything. I know This is a really nice idea though, holy shit You What if you just go for this export and look at it what happens now Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait You What if I don't clamp team what happens now Taking a shower is pretending to be productive I Mean you're gonna have to take a shower What is the problem the texture displays from like this It's like a lot of it is cut off or something It's not actually what the texture looks like here What even is happening here it's like texture is stretched by two Right You What if I do this what happens now That looks the same, right This thing should sound look like texture looks like what you're seeing here. I Think it's a bug in the exporting tool Structure out of scale checked. I'm pretty sure this Yeah Never tried to use a different UV basis, so that was not solution either I'm not reading the display list. That is a good idea, but I'm not very good at that But we can try it meanwhile No, no this takes forever I Let's take a look maybe we find something obvious I feel like a flower probably knows what's going on So the world shape is the one that's being wrong It's a 32 by 128 texture in blender Set tile size as being set to 1 0 and 0 0 As in tile size to shift T here, where's my minus two I don't want to try that then Isn't this what the tile size does am I going crazy I Know that was definitely not an either I Don't see my minus two anywhere though, right? It should be somewhere you shouldn't not It goes from 0 to 8. It's in a positive range, but it's letting me set negative values. This is not how it works Minus 5 to 10 I You're telling them to be like 7 now Just like subtract 5 boys instead I'm supposed to look at this I Will buy a back Shift of minus 2 should be encoded as 14. I Did see a 14 here So that seems right And then this one is 2 0 and 7 Yeah, I'm not familiar with these numbers are These Size line team tile tile is yes palette is no CMT looks fine Mask T Shift T is 0 Sounds right to me and shift s 5 I Just a 7 and shift T stand for 2 to the power of 7 as in 250 and 128 pixels because it is 128 pixels wide or high and it is 32 in the other direction This is painful to watch what am I doing wrong Lila feel free to tell me We can also check on n64 just to make sure this isn't some crazy emulator only buck L7 is max T, I see. Nope it's here on N64 as well. It seems either like a preview Fast64bug or like an export Fast64bug. I wonder if I can just do this. I know now it looks completely wrong in the preview, but maybe it works. Maybe if I only shift it by one it would work. But yeah, this definitely seems evil and wrong. Yeah now it works. At least I think this is what Biobak wanted. Maybe not quite. No that's exactly what he wanted, okay. I guess we just have to model the level like this. Definitely a Fast64bug, right? I'm not insane here. That is a legitimate bug. And that crashes on me I'm sure. Because of the collision. Is it the collision map still? What is it then Leela, tell me. Beating twice more. Huh? I'm talking about the crashes, not the visuals. I wonder if when I bleed in inline materials, if that will break the texture again. This is a really strange bug with it just displaying wrong. Yep, that's still right. Wait, are you saying it's not a bug in Fast64? That it repeats twice when it shouldn't? That seems unlikely to me. So I'm slowly starting to lose hope that this is because of the collision. Because 5500 triangles shouldn't be that much. Although all my other levels are way less than that. I'll make a bug report when I'm done streaming. Although that would mean that if the bug gets fixed it changes how my level looks. Oh, this is a sneaky triangle by your back. Unless you needed a photo lighting, in which case, go ahead. Fair enough. I'm going to paint them by... Shit, what's it called? By angle. I noticed that it reduced 2000 triangles in the collision map. Which pretty much means there were 2000 triangles just for lighting most likely. So we need these to stay on the floor. Because they are important for the lighting in the collision map. We can do the lighting by whatever happens in the collision map here. Oh, we can't do that here. We're just going to have to have a general light here. That's fine. Or, well, we could use the ceiling. But it's not going to look good anyway. If we do that. Okay, this is so evil. He's removing all of Biomech's detail. Why would he do this? Wait, what? Oh, okay, I see. Oh, that was a weird triangle. Let's put that in the other map as well. What is this for? That is sneaky.  2900 is still a ton of triangles for a collision map. I'm also feeling like maybe. No, it's not the amount of objects. Never mind. It has to be collision. I saw my shadow disappear there. That's on a good sign. Maybe I'm hallucinating, but it seems much stable. Okay, but it crashed when I approached the cock. The cock might be overflowing the collision because it is collision that is dynamically loaded. So that's a very good sign that this is actually what's going on. In that case, let me blow up the collision buffers as much as I can and try again. The what? The cock. I'm talking about the cock. I'll be very careful to talk, to make you an ARCG in that word. Despite my accent. Okay, that doesn't work. Blowing up the collision buffers that much literally just crashes the game. Fair enough. Oh my God. I'm definitely out of data here. Surely we don't need group 5, right? Group 8, whatever that is. What is this? Ah shit, it's the cap switch bank. We do need that one. But that one's super small, so it doesn't even matter. All right, well, now we know for sure this is data overflow though. So let's actually make a decent collision map. Yeah, I'm going to disable the debug stuff if I think about it. Hopefully I do. The only reason that was debug stuff in the last demo was because I forgot to disable it. It was that stupid. It's funny. Bro got fronted two hours late, two minutes late, whatever. Dude, I'm almost done 100%ing Twilight Princess for the first time in my life. This will be the first Zelda game I've ever 100%ed. I have a crazy theory about Twilight Princess and that is that the game is unfinished. As in they ran out of time developing the game. They got done with all that's absolutely necessary to make a running game and then barely had time to polish it up. It's my theory. Anyone want to contest that? You also felt that? That's crazy. It's like a lot of the story beats just seem like they're not fleshed out. They just give me the vibe that there was meant to be more there and that just isn't. And then all the paths between dungeons. There's often like not enough happening between dungeons. It's like dungeon to dungeon. It's like they made the dungeons but then didn't have enough time to fill in the in between of the dungeons. There's like weird scenes like the Iliad scene after you get the mirror shards and the fused shadow shards that just comes out of nowhere. Or even silly stuff like there is gongs that when you hit them with the morning star they don't go bong. They just do nothing. If they had enough time that thing would do bong. For sure. Preserving dialogue after like a third of the way through the game. And like it'll come up with excuses not to change rooms like near the end when you go to the trial room and then there's no reason to hide anymore and stuff like that. Yeah. Not carrying on. Okay this Twilight Princess is like 2004. Come on. This was 20 years ago. You can't be like modern Nintendo is so bad because Twilight Princess feels unfinished. That's a silly thing to say. Yeah it's a decent game for sure. I'm by no means saying it's bad. I'm just saying that I have my special senses are telling me it's not fully finished. I wonder if maybe that is because they had to import it to the Gamecube from the Gamecube to the Wii so late. Like they were just told late that that was going to happen. You didn't like it. That's crazy. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  I never played Shadow of Colossus so I wouldn't know. And yeah it's definitely one of the darker Zeldas. Gongs work in like every video game they're in. That's such a free points right? Because hitting a gong is fun. Like even in real life hitting a gong is fun. Of course you're going to add that to your video game because it's fun. But you in real life ever walk past a gong and like resist just giving it a good like bong. Like you gotta hit it right? I'm sure the boys will understand. Every Zelda game is the darkest Zelda game in Wind Waker. Argument destroyed. I think it's time that you shut the hanging pots down. Stop playing notes. Yeah. I mean there are little things that I also add to my games. Just like random things you can have fun with. Like why wouldn't you add those? I'm going to offer you a job that isn't working on us. I don't know. I mean they're working with Toby Fox, right? That he was a modder. But also, like, what would I even do at Nintendo? Could you just tell me anything instead of jumping on a tire when it launches you upwards like five meters? Sounds like you're playing Fortnite. Not sure what was going on there. Oh, we can make this have a nice blast sound effect. That's going to be nice and satisfying. Oh, that's crazy, Sonic. In a big company, the way you work is very different from what I do here. What I do here is basically I call all the shots. I can develop my game like as fast as I want. I don't need like approval from 15 people to do anything. When you work in a corporation, everything is much slower. Everything goes for like five departments. Stuff like that. I wouldn't be able to just make games, right? I guess if I worked at Nintendo, I could be like a programmer. Because they want everyone to be like on a specialized skill or something. But in like programming modern games, which I mean, I guess I do work in Unreal Engine. But that's very different from what I do here, right? That's unrelated to this. I wouldn't be able to just make a full game if I was working at like a company like that. That's just not what they're looking for. For this Peach game, you just need someone to make one. Maybe you can pay off Nintendo to make it for you. If you don't have the money for that, I don't know what to tell you. I don't know. Shit, I can't just delete this. Oh, actually I can. This is gonna make working on this a little bit difficult. I should not have worked like this. Oh, man. Dude, why can it not snap to this? That's crazy. Yeah, I'm already in course 15. But keep in mind after this, we still need to do the Overworld and the Bowser level and some side level. So after this, there's... Do we have one or two side levels? I think we have two side levels. So after this, there's three side levels missing if you include the Bowser one. So it's still gonna be a little bit. But course 15 feels like one of those levels that are faster to develop than the rest. Because there's not much character interactions. And usually the part that takes the longest to develop is the character interactions. So there's that. Dude, I actually remember doing this exact thing before. For the first collision map I made for this level. That's crazy. That memory stuck around. And this is another 1000 triangles down so far. Surely now the level will work fine. Right? No more crashes. Please. So I do actually have Monday and Tuesday off, which means maybe bonus streams. Still? Maybe it is not this after all. This should be just vulnerable. Oh, well. I mean, if you have a really unique idea, I think that makes sense. Really unique game ideas can be super valuable. But having a really unique game idea is also very rare. Should have got some of the most unexpectedly popular games of recent times. They're all like poorly made, but insanely cool idea. At least that was my experience. I'm just going to finish the collision map. We have to do that anyway. And if it still doesn't work, then we can figure it out. I don't know. Gaming Sona hasn't been anything innovative in 10 years. Didn't Factorio came out just recently? Isn't that one innovative? I don't know. I haven't played it. But from the sounds of it, that one's innovative. What about the deck builder genre that started becoming popular recently? What about? I mean, I guess Leap of Company came out recently. It's very popular. A lot of social deception games. What else? I barely play video games, so it's hard for me to think of good new creative ones. Okay, that's just Yoshi's Island DS, and it sucked. No front, but fuck Yoshi's Island DS. What's the theme for the final course? It's an arcade in space. So, a space arcade. It is an arcade, not a casino. I don't want any gambling in here. You said Yoshi's Island DS is good? No way, bro. There is no way. You're serious. They took running, a basic mechanic that is required to play the game, and made it an ability. And then they made it so that sometimes you're forced to walk back, switch your ability, crawl back to where you were, because now you switched off the run ability, and crawl back to where you were before. That is so ass. No way anyone actually likes that. I refuse to believe. And some sneaky triangles. Let's see. Anti-gravity plane? Not anti-gravity, but low-gravity sections. Which are kind of like anti-gravity sections. Now? Still Yoshi's Island DS? I haven't played it that far. I had to quit pretty early, because I was getting so pissed off by the game. Well, I guess I'm the bad guy now. Fuck Yoshi's Island DS. Wait. Before I condemn you, have you played the normal Yoshi's Island before? Because if you haven't played the normal Yoshi's Island, I can kind of see how you would think it's a good game. Because Yoshi's Island is just that bit of a game. I actually think the Game Boy Advance version is the best one, because it has the cute noises. I got it all messed up. Why? Am I mixing this up with a different game? Bite you? I will... Where are you? Give me your address. I will come over and bite you. I don't know. I don't know. To me it just literally took Yoshi's Island and made it worse. What? You haven't regretted it? I couldn't do it. There was just one too many times where I was walking through the level, having fun with baby Mario, being able to run, and then the game just stopped me where I am. I was like, nope, you need Donkey Kong. Walk all the way back, get the stupid baby Donkey Kong, lose your ability to run, and then come back. It's kind of like the same sin that Mario 64 DS has. Hello, John Fox. Mario is indeed awesome. Okay, now you're trolling. Guys, do you really want to side with the person that said 64 DS was fun as well? Come on. Can I get baby Mario? Ah, okay. I haven't played it since. I see, I see. I actually find as a child I had a lot more patience for video games than as an adult. People saying children are impatient. I was a lot more patient as a kid. I didn't have brain rot. Do you think I have brain rot? It's when I was doing the same shit over and over? Yeah. I remember when I beat the water temple in Ocarina of Time as a kid. Like as a kid. And everyone's saying it's confusing and difficult now and frustrating. But imagine doing that as a kid. That must have taken ten times as long. And I did it. That's how much patience I have. It's actually weird how as a kid I didn't consider a game something you got to play but rather something you had to beat. Did you guys have the same thing? It's like in my mind beating a game is like an inherent good thing that needs to happen. As in someone has to get this done. That probably was only a me thing. Spent time just walking around making a blower. Interesting. Same thing I had to play in the game. As an adult I need to get through the game. Interesting. As an adult for me it's more like, well now obviously I'm conscious that a game is something you play to enjoy it, not to beat it. But also I kind of demand of a game that the act of beating it optimally is fun. I don't want to have to play in a stupid way just so I can enjoy it. So when I think about a Pokemon game where you kind of have to force yourself to break through the game slowly as in catch a team of six Pokemon to have fun, I can't really do it anymore. The optimal way to play a Pokemon game is you just get one starter, you overlevel it and then you catch the box legendary two hours into the game and you just beat the beat 4 with a bunch of X-Power-Ups. Which I guess you could by ending X-Power-Ups on the box legendary. But it would still be the optimal way to beat the game with an overleveled starter and that's just not fun. Do you think RTA will become the default rumming as in if someone gets in a rumming and asks for a good one to play, people recommend RTYI? Maybe. I have a little bit of a doubt about that just because RTYI's physics are so different. So it could be that people don't recommend it because they will get like used to the wrong movement. No, I don't think you need difficulty at all to enjoy something. But RTYI is definitely going to be the rumming where people are like, this is the reason I even get into rummings. So it's going to have that going for it. It might also have the opposite effect where people are like, oh, this rumming doesn't have RTYI physics, don't even bother playing it. That's also entirely possible. Maybe a few years down the road. Yeah, I think people will rummix off of this because I'm going to make the board public. Well, one benefit that's severely underrated about the RTYI range right now is all the physics improvements. And you guys probably can't tell just from me playing, but the physics do feel infinitely better. Everything you do just works. Everything you do just works. Yeah, that too. You can have crazy geometry in this engine and it's going to perform better than the vanilla engine and the crazy geometry too. Like despite the collision being more complex, it's going to be fine. All right, I don't think I can reduce the collision much more than 3,900. So if this doesn't fix it, we are in shit. Then there is some kind of weird thing going on. Well, actually, there already is some weird thing going on. Okay, let's check the debugging emulator. See if we find anything. If we're lucky and we just get a crash screen, that would be awesome. Unhandled sub OP killed 0x03. Huh? This is cursed. Time to remove everything but Mario. Let's see what happens. Okay, now it's too fast. Okay, if the level just works now, that's a very good hint that it's one of the objects that's crashing. That would make my life so easy. All right, that's probably an object then. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yep, it is time to see which object it is now. I'm just going to take out one type of object at a time, and I'm going to take out whatever I think is most likely to cause the crash. Let's start with the factory window. And then the producer. I think we might have an actor overflow here. Yeah, it's not that good. I mean, the producer being, it seems very likely because we tripled the producers with the new layout. And that wasn't there before. It's not it. Okay, now the wall gears. The wall gears? No way it's the wall gears. That makes no sense at all. How could it possibly be the wall gears? And where did the bomb cam go? Wait, how does the air vent work? Don't spawn objects, please. Please tell me it's just a particle object. Can it really be the wall gears? The smoke has a memory hump? It does. Okay, and there's an actor overflow. The wall gears just randomly made it not overflow anymore. At least I think so. Although I don't think this should be overflowing. I don't think we have that many actors. I don't think we have that many actors. Hmm. That's the wrong way I'm working again. Okay. So every single one of the brick walls is 10 bricks. So this is 44 objects. Yeah, that makes a little more sense now that it's overflowing. Just a little bit. Now, the start of the stream was figuring out Chris 15. A lot of it was collision mapping. I haven't spent much time figuring out the crash at all. I've just been doing other useful things that might be solving the thing. But I haven't actually tried to solve the thing yet. Hmm. Wait, no. The brick wall is spawned once it explodes, but not before. So this shouldn't be it. Hmm. Hmm.  I don't know why it wasn't. Hmm. Why don't we just crank the shit out of it? Hmm. Wait, did I maybe make this level one day and then at a later day, reduce the total size of the RAM object chain? That seems very possible to me. Let's see. Yeah, it was 330 and somewhere else it said 440. That's probably it. I don't think I celebrate Thanksgiving. Actually, we do, but Canadian Thanksgiving. Did you see how my Yoshi coin display at the top changed? Okay, but the fact that it crashed at 440 and at 330 means this is not it. The theory doesn't check out anymore.  So maybe something in the gym? No, this looks good. But removing the factory windows and the gears fixed it. Looks fine too. Unless. Unless this lets me overflow. Nope, it does not. All right, fellas, I'm just going to fix our stream. My stream's been going for too long anyway. I'll be seeing you guys next stream, which might be tomorrow, might be Monday or Tuesday, depending on how I feel. We're probably going to finish the rework for this level first, and then we're going to go right back to cross 15.
