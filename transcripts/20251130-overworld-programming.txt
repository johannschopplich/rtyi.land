you you you you No, hello. Ah, there we go. There we go. We fixed it Hilariously, it was not Windows updates It was because I unplugged my microphone because I had to plug in some things to put the SD card in to upload stuff onto My analog 3d Hello divos We have so many cool new things to show so many cool things You My microphone is finally like yeah, I turned up the thing Apparently there's a lot of static in my microphone. I didn't even know They said OS I can't I need it for work look at this new feature How fucking cool is that Tell me how cool it is Let it grow it's the thing they do in Mario Odyssey and Mario Galaxy I Think I'm a Libra. I know the German word is Vaga, which means scale But Libra and scale are very intertwined so that sounds about right I Don't believe in astrology though, actually, you know what I do believe in astrology just to be a contrarian but like not in the stupid way, I believe in astrology and the way that your star sign and the month in which you were born are correlated fucking obviously and the month in which you were born has strong implications Towards the age difference between you and your peers in early childhood when you get into school and that's going to affect the personality Think about it You I think in that sense. I believe in astrology more than the average person Let me get some move it feels like butter. Well, I'm just that good And you elaborate Okay, the elaboration is your star sign at the month in which you were born are correlated fucking obviously, right? And the month you were born determines the age difference between you and the people that you go to school with and That is going to affect your personality because your early childhood is going to be very different Like between you being half a year older 10% older than everyone and you being half a year younger You're gonna be way bigger and way smarter than other people That's going to make a difference. That's going to be a big difference. I Think there's actually a lot of evidence that people that are older than their peers in school Are more likely to get into sports Wait star signs more likely to become pro athletes. That would be like the biggest. Oh My god, they're actually doing astrology here Okay birth months more likely months more likely to become pro athletes My athletes birthday effect who goes pro see That's what you wanted the right time of the year Place one in first quarter of the section. I got a future age groups teams. You're picked which is normally the school Yeah, I'll represent both youth and professional sports. Oh, right because That's going to be even more relevant Because like whether you're 17 and 11 months or 17 and one months is a big difference too Yeah See astrology is real See astrology is real Yo, thank you for the dollar goofy goober Good luck on the plumbing once you know you're trying to GTA 6. I don't think so How do you know how much nanoseconds you see from things I'm end of course a benchmarks and then logic facts and logic like art, sorry I'm audibly stimming Oh, it's not that complicated to you go It's just imagine being a six-year-old and then imagine having to play soccer against the person that's six years and 11 months They're going to be a lot bigger than you so you're fucked up That's literally the entire logic behind it That's literally the entire logic behind it Nice goofy Also fun fact I have gotten the analog 3d and And Look at how cycle accurate. This is this is my n64 54 FPS. This is the analog 45 FPS Huh 21 milliseconds are you RSP 15.8? You what FPGA are the same thing Yep You You It also has black vertical lens, what's that about? Oh, that's my TV The TV I have is very bad and it also has to CNN logo burned in because saying us that is a lip tart They're to be done on the future room dimension transfer speed yes a lot of work Canadian celebrate Thanksgiving they do but they do it like a month early It's my dad case Then that your dad is a lip turd, but you know what as far as boomers go. That's actually a good thing Because most boomers are insane in the other direction You Hello Marty You're even getting brain chips that I already ready and world ruling secret society Yeah, I'm not sure if I trust brain chips Anyway our mission today design more Yoshi NPCs. So what I did. Oh my god I actually did so much work over the week. I didn't even realize God, I was so fucking locked and swinging Basically, we now have Yoshis that have conditional dialogue branches and these dialogue branches updates whenever you Make progress in the game So Like your she's can start having different dialogues at 15 stars and 20 stars when you've collected star 2 in course for we have an entire system for that So that's gonna make the overworld feel very alive We might program the old Yoshi today. Yes But I'd like to do some of these Yoshi dialogues So I think this is the coy guy This guy is going to be talking about the course I've marked them as unassigned. Oh No, this is the coy guy him. Oh Yeah, we also have a system to automatically generate colors for every Yoshi So each Yoshi has a random color that is assigned to them by the place that we put them into the overworld world I'm gonna get a bunch of NPCs constantly updated in dialogue. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly More reason to go around accidentally punching NPCs Yeah, you're not gonna accidentally punch NPCs. Look at this You can barely even do it on purpose. I Don't give a fuck about Half-Life 3 Half-Life 1 sucked ass, Half-Life 2 sucked ass. Why would I want Half-Life 3? Actually, they already made Half-Life 3. It's still VR thing Oh Yeah, Hail to the Longo is pretty good You Anyway, so all these Yoshis can have very unimportant dialogue now that we have added the pop-up dialogue functionality Because now with the pop-up dialogue functionality We can very clearly mark any important NPCs like this So any text that is mandatory, there is no issue with the player finding it and all these unnecessary texts players will not find it I believe here that VR Half-Life is fun. It's probably a lot more fun than the normal one The normal one is just okay for me. This was my experience with the normal one It's run around save state scam as much as possible and get stuck somewhere press the interact button on literally everything in your view You We did not go to PC port we will not go to PC port the PC port is ass It's gonna really damn for the n64 And was poorly programmed just like any n64 game. It shouldn't have been that happy if you ask me. Oh I Am somewhat confident that they can pull off a better game than Half-Life 1 and 2 and Half-Life 3 if They actually are working on Alpha 3. I don't know what the fuck you guys are talking about I don't know if you guys are trolling with Half-Life 3. It sounds like a joke to me You Anyway about these Yoshi NPCs Is there any where reasonably we could put useful dialogue in We could put this guy with the bombs. He could be talking about the bombs How about that the whole dialogue tree about the bomb family here? Since I'm a trained rat nerds to play doom I simulated a nematode brain in Mario 64 and made a play Mario 64 Now there's evidence they're working on and search the game symbols, okay You It's real it's just all the announcement example shit Mission a pop-up family know a bump family There is a family of bombs Then I'll right here So it's me really Oh, you don't look like you are one of us. You're not allowed in scram So there could be one guy. So at first they sleep and you can't kick him I'm gonna use my Yoshi NPCs Probably like 180 I can check real quick You Check that Come on 290. Oh my god way more than I thought Yeah, so Actually don't like that. These two Yoshi's look so similar Okay, here's what you do if you want to get these two Yoshi's to look a bit different Take this Yoshi. I mean she just move him somewhere else That's it You At least I managed to go in there for my sex I was worried I was making a little in this optimal Oh, no, no. No, I I Mean obviously, um, actually, you know what? I think that conquer we can say it was not fine because the game didn't sell well did That's kind of like the only Measurement of quality you can give any piece of art is how well does it serve its purpose? Or even any product in the world. How well does it serve its purpose? like You Yeah, I'm not giving an example actually you guys get what I mean The audio she models are like 600 triangles No, they only their initial spot matters be savory and then they can move around You Anyway determine Yoshi text so we can make a dialogue tree here. This is how they work So You make the Yoshi Bump family Dialogue tree You just add it here You We set as B perm 4 to 1 And now he is using this dialogue tree Use retopo flow it's handy for energy. I don't mean you can literally trace around the sculpt. No, I work on the n64 Okay, so While asleep so while they're sleeping Maybe he should say something nice. I hear that ball snore What's going on? And Then while awake Walls just woke up And let me want to let me through And then after I think Or well after Yes, I think The wall is gone, but Mountains Stay here something like that So this way you have to Yoshi evolve his dialogue as you progress through the game and he reacts to the events going on in the world But how much the answer you'd make what would be faster ramp, I mean obviously right What is the game which was well programmed for the n64 standards? The only thing that really comes to mind that Hmm Honestly, no idea. I know something like f-zero runs pretty well Like the performance of f-zero seems way more impressive than something that conquers bad for a day to me Like obviously it's less work, but like it might be more well done, but I guess it's also a really simple game. Oh Yeah, the factor 5 games obviously. Yes They are a much better example You And there is daikon tear as well The arenas You We could add an Italian voice model AI Mari player that can this year will speed running I'm not doing that. I Can't use AI if I use AI the people will literally murder me You Yeah, exactly it never likes but it's simple Yeah, then We need these two flags You So this is what type we'd say blacks Let's do it's for zero for left no terminates And Then param one is the flag type which is this one Two is the like that I D. Oh This is kind of awkward I Don't like this Can I okay you see how this is one and then to the left three can I like Get the third root of the value or the nth root until it terminates the two at one Is that possible? Yeah You Where are you I they seem kind of part of the ocean games no, it's still kind of a Mario game You know, it's just It sucks I'm doing it like this, but it's what else am I gonna do And and then we need one more notes I know actually actually also terminates here And One two and three You um, um when No, baby brushy, no, it will not be So a lot of eagles at the same time in some modes when the grass about but still Yeah, I mean vehicles are not or much less right? So it's cheaper I Wasn't I Oh nothing real Why not You You Oh, we should try our new text system You Okay, no, let's try maybe You All right, let's try it Let's see what color we got this is kind of fun you just move to your sheet somewhere and then you get a random Interesting What happens It'd be an easy fix I would hope maybe I messed this up somehow Waves are mysterious in nature? Gasner was a heretic? I don't get it. Who's Gasner? Guys okay stupid question, but Like When you hear people talk about quantum physics, do you feel that they're like way over complicating it for absolutely no fucking reason They're always pretending. It's this mysterious difficult thing When like the basic concept this fun for me, it just seems like the basic concept is that places or particles aren't Distinct things but rather like the evaluation of a wave of probabilities You For a formula guy he was inspired by sitting by the sea But definitely uses own kind of mini-city and authentication the parents would stop and I figure out how to pirate it I have no idea I Really really want you to understand this intimately as they do. Okay, but I feel like 99% of people talking about it Don't understand it. I Think that's why it sounds so complicated because you're being explained this concept by people that don't understand it No crashes, I don't know what I did wrong What changes have we made even I Should have maybe read the error message Dude I remember when I started to get into n64 modding So many people wanted to identify with the label of being able to assembly program But they weren't able to assembly program and I wasn't able to assembly program it back then either So I asked those people for help and they would just tell you the most stupid and wrong shit Possible like genuinely asking the people that claimed that they were able to assembly program for help Made it take longer to learn to assembly program. I Like this blue Yoshi hello Skyloft, it has been a while Oh, that's fucked up we gotta fix that real quick It looks like we are not activating the right time stuff like here But the 100% rewrite is cool and kept secret there's already a lot of rewards in the game that You are never going to find So don't worry there will be lots of secrets Missed a lot of really cool stuff being in it. Yeah Look this is something I added just this week the pop-up dialogue Essentially don't watch my stuff because of spoilers. That's gotta be rough Oh There we go, that's all it needs Yeah Okay, nice Now the Yoshi's text should be updated The wall is gone, but it's full of graphics behind it. I'll just stay here It works you see that how his text changed in real time as we made progress in the game If you make a tweak in importance, you stay now over five stars no, I mean, yes, I could but I'm not gonna You Hmm. Oh You're gonna like the sky lofty. I'm sure you've heard of the analog 3d Look, the RSP is 30% slower than on the real n64 The framerate is 15% lower. It's completely wrong I don't like this text way. It's based. It's just awful You even I don't feel you right next to you Oh I will say I talked to the engineer that worked on the analog and he says he has a good idea on how to fix It It's what he said You Is that a side quest system there is Kind of Yoshi mission side quest, but I mean this Mario 64, right? Everything's a side quest So that runs on some old text and run really boring. I'm sure hardware. They're imperfectly smooth Also locks at max FPS. Yeah, I mentioned You said that my favorite is to start around the game at full frame rate right on the n64 There's probably many things that are too bad to run it at like full 60 FPS But the full 30 you basically get it across the entire game You We'll do this and because the main character that's our other that's all main quests Okay, I Think we have Some of this now we still have a lot of unassigned texts, but that's fine I'm a given. She's disguised as a Yoshi with the big Kamek and glasses Hmm And we had a star maybe a toy Did you grab out of the lake? I think this one is just garbage and when I'm doing that Now we need to do the Kamek event and Palm trees. Oh, yeah, we have palm trees You It will be do the palm tree collision now or later think about it How do we best implement it I Guess we could have one dynamic model and one static model and then the model is swapped out whenever you're close to it Let's do that What's that six model and then the model In switches Spoons actually, no Dynamic model It's your erratics beast would be able to handle a procedure I have no idea Was he writing Italian text instead of italic text and you list of intentional it was That's how people in Italy talk they just lean towards one side You Oh, there's so much text now and I lost Oh, he looks like the ones from Benji console, maybe I'm using some protection You Yes, I'm streaming on the second channel I never scream on the main channel there's too many people asking stupid questions if I do Yeah, it's so awesome awful people in Italy you just refuse to acknowledge you on this you mean After Patient Don't have that This This You Or make enchanted blocks, we don't It was actually In part five the ocean is an egg and egg stars, okay, we need to do that I Don't know flag Rama Wait, don't I know your name? Haven't I read you before somewhere? I feel like we've talked before in one of the n64 discords Welcome to the stream You You don't compliment at all, but you have this Calculi so like you can't numbers if I asked it like 17 by 5 You just can't do it Or what does that mean Okay, so we can do the X thing It's definitely one thing I Let's first did a chemic event then I don't want to put a whole peaches castles and custom here, but don't worry. We're gonna put something here Okay So we had the idea that there would be an event here we're in the Yoshi town eventually and now you Yoshi would appear and They would have the camera glasses and you'd affect expose them. I think that was the idea Fortunately, it's been a while. So I'm kind of Not a hundred percent sure anymore. What we said we wanted to do unless someone remembers this randomly. I Think it had to do something with progressing beyond the second overworld Because we wanted these goofy talking blocks that are evil and you have to turn them back somehow Yeah, I don't know what guest emotion is that doesn't mean anything I don't know where it's I know math formulas If you have the math formula for it, I can take a look That is true a miniature would be a cool Easter egg Let's see. Okay. Oh Did we say you are going to reach the next overworld? We had this written down somewhere around here Evil message block that insults you and rhymes find the chemic in part 5 to get past Something like who is stinky and won't pass the red plumber that smells like ass just without the swearing. Okay, that's awesome That's the first time you approach them. They are friendly face and apologize then move out of the way Approaching one of them should move both of them Actually, I don't like that I think you should move both individually It will be e for everyone yes And I think we should have similar notes here Yeah Okay, so the chemic event would be related to this that means we should finish this first And leave the chemic event for later Maybe we should program the palm leaves for now then Okay, you just described gas in a wave by saying gas net deformations that that doesn't explain anything that's circular No, I sound like the people in the what is a woman discussion Yeah Anyway, I think we should turn this into all the problem is I don't want to program this yet because I'm pretty sure Biobank is going to make this look nicer and then I'd have to reprogram it I will leave a note for biobank here You You look for what I mentioned And you don't know why oh, let's see. Okay, fine. I'll look Looks very expensive Didn't you recommend this last time we made waves and we already said we don't do it pretty sure there was something like that Anyway, that means what we can now do is the Yoshi dojo with the old man So Zena made some animations for him Let me get that Old master Yoshi So, okay. This guy is awesome He's going to give you hints on how to find more stuff if you're like stuck, but you have to beat them in a fight first But the way he fights is great How someone else might have brought them up then and not you So this is his idle animation he is an old man keep that in mind Zena where's the animations the animations are missing Wrong and it's the only one I have Send me the newest model then I don't think you have Hello badoop Zero will just send me the newest song he made So I will import that later today You But Now my computer storage is no longer maxed out We actually start up here we go hold Yoshi master fixed that is just what I needed All right, here we go, that's this is walk animation This is how he's going to be approaching you very dangerous enemy. And then This is how he attacks And Then when you attack him he You fucking Dyson one shit It's like patience young and strength is not everything and Going to be great No, no He's going to pretend to be like the master of fighting and to be your instructor and then he just fucking dies in one Hit it's going to be great Perhaps I have underestimated you You show idol to let's see what I don't do is He is a wise old man You I am not sure what you mean our lunch. Oh Okay, well I see what you mean no, no we would want to have roughly the same waves both otherwise that's a jarring contrast Then make him totally kick your ass none of the bait and switch is already there we don't want to double bait and switch him We have him important. We already do have him importance Is this even part of castle grounds or is it inside castle it's inside castle, okay So we do need to delete the old file Because we originally this was probably like three or four years ago wanted him to be part of the first overworld You This thing teach you the new helicopter move now, you'll already have it by that time It's not a move at all you learn it in the first level the bunnies teach it to you There's blue tutorial bunnies and 11 text above their head that says help So you will be inclined to go to watch them so to teach you this You Hey There we go X is too large You And maybe we need to vet all the textures first What is this This supposed to be a ci4 Xena Going to assume so You Minus from this is a material I made probably That's the back Me oh, this is also way too big Are we also supposed to be a ci4 Here it can be an i8 that's good Belly just white It should not be setting lighting here This should also be a pure i4 It should also be a pure i4 okay some issues with the textures we need to fix before we can import him I'm 23 well also she years. Are you trying to imply that Yoshi's died? I am 23 what is that I am 23 well also she years. Are you trying to imply that Yoshi's died? You Oh that looks quite a bit worse Is there something we can do Not really it will have to be that Unlucky You And then I'm behind Mario no one then just Yoshi sir meet for this man And me to serve oh my god, have you guys been watching blurry bus? Where is bio back he told me I should watch it or something he made me watch it and now I need to talk about it Oh, no, oh no, my PC is gonna crash. Oh fuck I love Windows 11. I think I need to forcibly end This oh, never mind, we're fine Threatening it with house manager fixed it You're here. Let's go. Bye. I'm back And watch blurry bus on episode 2. I said this whole show It's about the three laws of robotics and about AI as well. Kind of Is this the general reddit opinion? This is something people believe or am I just crazy for saying that? I Get in trouble whenever blender leaks of our device only a six-inch. Oh dang. Yeah, I needed more for my actual job It's so AI coded, but it's not just AI it's like the three laws of robotics. That's what this is about But hey, yeah, I guess that's very AI coded I'm thinking the whole story is that there's like a faraway planet and they develop this AI I I'm thinking the whole story is that there's like a faraway planet and they develop this virus that enters your mind and turns you into like a slave that respects the three laws of robotics and then The show is just like these are the consequences. We would see if AI goes rogue basically He's from the gene the blurbs every second sentence. Yeah You Okay, this texture kind of sucks it doesn't need to be this big So the plurbs is what they are called in the fandom You But this is this is the general opinion that this is like a critique of AI or Like am I just crazy for thinking that Or not necessarily I but the loss of robotics You This game is I a trust me What games are we talking about pluribus pluribus Intelligence artificial I see I see Me feel that one second black me go down to 60 Hertz then was gone. Did you have a stroke? Are you okay? Do you need a hospital? You Like the character designs the back tails You In Arizona, there's a this shows me per humans disclaimer at the end and getting this very anti AI so there's at least that Okay, so I'm definitely on the right track But this is the common opinion or did I just Make this up like this. This is something am I alone in this? Will I be a contrarian when I say that this is what it's about? Because I like to be a contrarian I'd love to be the only one with this opinion Hector 0 uses too many what? No, zero for I literally indexed this to 60 colors life on stream I I I Literally indexed this to 60 colors life on stream You What the fuck nope, everyone gets on that sorry, no You I'm not special Okay Also, are you on Carol's side on a pluribus side? Well, okay the pluribus is just like slave hive minds like it's not really It's hard to even consider it like a thing to be on the side on off like it's like When you watch a movie with a natural disaster, you're not on the side of the tornado, right? At most you would hope everyone dies if you hate them So, I don't even perceive the perps as a character I guess so it's like impossible to emphasize or be on its side You And That was more of an open discussion about collectivism as an individualism But there's very special take if there are deeper topics Well, I guess if you don't know about the free loss of robotics, it would be a lot less obvious that that's what it's about You Thing was unused my compiler told me It Wouldn't blend the force of the quad edge to rotate when I go two tries two quads Different rotating it. Oh I just picks a random one if you do that It's going to be a lot. I think like with the movie splice, but except against the answer of genetic engineering Hmm I don't think so. I think that's a very linear reading of it. I The idea that you watch a movie and like the movie has a message that you're supposed to get is Kind of brain rot to me. That sounds like propaganda not like an art piece It's supposed to like show a worldview or a Theoretical world the fantasy and then just present you the consequences of that and you're supposed to look at it and be like, oh I can learn this from that or This is stupid because of these reasons that I disagree with right? not Okay, this is what it is. This is the message we're done here Does that make sense I guess the latter. That's just how propaganda works. That's not how it works I have not watched splice But I'm sure I I don't doubt that there's a lot of like very linear and the Genetic engineering movies that sounds about right You It's not random make you stick the thing on you don't want well, it will always pick the same one It was zero five It was just a message, but everybody loves it Yeah, it's pro love and compassion propaganda It Is what it is man, it's propaganda for love and compassion, what can I tell you You I do know about the freelance harmonics, I reread iRobot is here but I thought they act like machines is more of a characterism. Oh okay yeah I can see that reading too that exactly emphasizes the point I just made that yes you can watch it and there is just one message but rather like you look at the world view and you draw your own conclusions from it. Isn't that nice? Then you can watch a movie and get a completely different view. You are not immune to propaganda. Do not watch the Christmas Carol. You will become more passionate. You will start believing in Alburism and helping your fellow man. They are manipulating you. I did not place the Yoshi down. I completely forgot to do that. I will do that first. Does anyone want to join the Hivemind? Absolutely not. Joining the Hivemind is basically the same as killing yourself because you no longer exist after that. You might as well have asked me do you want to kill yourself and the answer is no. Christmas Carol turned into a dark book. That's exactly what will happen. A homebook? What is a homebook? If you were a part of Diplomacy you would just die. That's not you anymore. That's like would you clone yourself and then kill yourself? Would that matter to you? If I gave you five bucks and then cloned you and killed the original would you be fine with that? I mean I guess technically the world wouldn't change really except I'd have five more dollars but like I'm dead. He turned the wrong way. He could be rotated zero. Ah. He has turned the wrong way, animation-wise. Okay. We can fix this. It doesn't matter. We're gonna lose two cycles to this, but that's fine. Ahem. Okay. So, what does he need to do? Do I want to add Mario at first, then become the fortune teller? Something like that? Humbug means nonsense. He's saying, oh, nonsense. He's talking garbage. Well, it's a German word. He wouldn't have heard of it. Two room rooms, not on the analog. Is there any... Do we want there to be anything you have to do to get a hint? Humbug? Hör ich da Scrooge? Wait. Scrooge and Humbug have something to do? Is it like the Christmas carol has something to do with Humbug? I didn't know of this. This is news to me. Ben has a perfectly fine 3D modeler. I don't think they're gonna make a better one anytime soon. Plus it's open source. I think there should maybe be a coin cost to get a hint. And the coin cost should lower as you get further in the game. Or something like that. Scrooge always says Humbug to Christmas stuff. Oh, I see. Is Scrooge's way of saying bullshit? Oh, so is the Christmas carol German? Oh, he's from Getty Images. Weird. Maybe the guy learned German. He's a distant elephant. Oh, the first hint is that there's a secret door in the dojo. And you have to walk into the secret door to flip it. Then it helps you come back if you're stuck again. That was the idea. So we need an arrow here. And an arrow here. It's insane, actually, because minus one is valid. We'll do something like this. And then we'll just have an array of all the secret stars on all the hints. That makes a little more sense. By the way, do I have any song requests today? I think beating him over and over to get more hints is very funny. Just the concept that every five minutes you go back to him to beat the fuck out of an old man. I like that. I will not. Oss! Oh crap, I'm in a race against time!  Again, well, like this might be important. This is my video editor doing stuff right now. And mine is probably just cocky enough saying some stupid shit. Oh no, that's actually a good suggestion. Will he be like the only Yoshi competent in combat? No, he will be extremely incompetent. He's going to be extremely old. Zayna, is there like a specific order to these idle animations? Why is there two idles? Oh, that would have been good to know. You just sent me the file. Why would I know that? The kick posing Yoshi does without advertising? Well, Mario learns to kick, so not really. Think about that. Old man Yoshi enum talk is not defined. Really? So you're telling me that the table enums are not being included? Oh my god, I'm not using that. I don't think we have enough text IDs to do this in. One of these. Oh. What happened to the music? I'm just not listening to any music right now. Do you guys want music? If you guys want music, which music do you want? I'm the next Dennis Rodman. Is that a threat? An insult? A praise? I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure. Because I have some pretty bad music. Any music is fun. My audio is fucked. Maybe I can wiggle them a little bit. Okay, so next we need to market Mario. This is good code we can just reuse. Goal bell equals 4. Close the map up. Okay, this is not good. This is older cell code. I gotta change this. I don't like this at all. Now we should have a Yoshi that walks at Mario at the correct moment. I'm fairly confident this will work, but we also need to change his hitbox. It's certainly possible, I'll argue, but I'm not sure how performant it would be. Is Mario in the Multiverse a good engine? Mario in the Multiverse's engine is based on Hacker Mario 64, and Hacker Mario 64 is... Let me think of the words. It is better than Mario 64. It is not good. Yeah. I don't know how good it actually is. I don't know, for some reason they do not want to put in any of the performance improvements I do, so I'm not a fan of it. And they always say some shit like, oh, but it's bad code, oh, but it's unreadable, but then no one can work with it anymore. I think that's all excuses. I think there's just no one that wants to put in the work. The engine's just not very good. And there's also some questionable decisions made in regards to that. Okay, we need a better collision type. That can't survive here. We still want Mario to be pushed. And we want this to be punched. What the fuck is this? We want these two. I love this limited action system. It's so much better than the last Mario 64. What's so crazy about that? Mario 64 is not an expensive game. I've shown you that it can run on the N64 with 75% idle time. PlayStation is only three times slower than Mario 64. Of course it can run on the PlayStation 1. It's cool that they did it. I'm very happy that they did. There's still a lot of King's Tower left, and I don't think it's so impossible. I think I applied this new attack system in Goomba. Now this is a completely new interaction system that the original Mario 64 does not use. That I made, and it is way more convenient to use. Here we go. I think this expires if we exist, which actually has more triangles on screen than because I'm making many of those cheap to overwrite with limited features. Yeah. When he's punched, it's fucking die. So basically, when you kick him, when you break dance at him, he fucking dies. When you jump on him, when you ground pound him, he fucking dies. When you tap him fast, he fucking dies. Then you still do nothing. Am I using GCC? Okay. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Is this function real? It is real. Okay. This should be most behavior implemented except for the attack. Also missing VFX and SFX, but that's for later. Let's see him. This is such an anime scene. Now he walks at me. Okay. Not 100% sure why he's turned the wrong way still. He should be turned the right way now. At least I thought I made him turn the right way. Let's see him. Old Cup in Yangon. This is the emoji in Gojo. We are the personal rivals here. We may have this run. We may have this run. Go! Let's go inside. I will guide you on your journey. Okay. There's an intro text. And then... Right. Do not come to lane. I did warn you. This will be... Actually that sounds too threatening. I don't know. I want him to sound semi-threatening, but also not kiss your enemy. Yes, the model is the wrong way around, which is why I turned it 180 degrees in coach. But it didn't seem to work. I hit Mario64DS. Mario64DS is the Antichrist. MrBeast named Mario64DS. How? How? How? What? Is the flag not working anymore? Nope, it's clearly here. Could it be that MakeTalkable destroys the flags? It does. I see. Well, good thing we figured that one out. How? Did I compile? I'm not confident I compiled. I don't know how this could be. Dude, we need to do the overworld map soon. Dude, I can't. Won't be. No. Flags. Resurrects are cursed? Oh no, what did they say? Something bad? What is Dory doing? I asked them a normal question and they sent me a picture of a weird cloud. 240b. 240b? Oh, ugh. It's set in the optimacy. I fucked it up. No wonder. Now it should work. Why that stuff about drugs? How? Not too surprising with a song like this. Come on! Hey! Hold up, young'un, this is the Yoshi dojo, the professor of idols here. You may have the strength, but do you have the skill? Or would you like to prove yourself? I shall teach you a lesson. He's too fast for my taste. And then that part works. Oh, he should talk to you instantly afterwards. I don't like that it takes that long. It's also too slippery afterwards for obvious reasons. Hmm. Oh wait, this needs to be lower. Half asleep, maybe? Oh. No wonder this wasn't working. Why does he slide? Because he's kicked. He needs getting clouds? Also true, we didn't do any VFX yet. He didn't instantly talk. Why not? He should be instantly talking here. Oh, wrong action state, that's why. Okay, let's add some sounds to this. He should have a Yoshi sound that's very much done. Oh, this dialogue should also be way pitched down. Let me see, where's the dialogue pitch again? Pitch is... right here. I hope this feature works. I'm actually not 100% confident it does. Yes, that would be great. But also, it's going to be like 3 seconds of music, so... Because realistically, like... yeah. If we had like an epic 5 second loop, I think that'd be perfect. That was definitely pitched down. Perfect. What? That's great. I should use the define here instead of doing this. Oh, that's bad. I could extend the time until contact if you have him go like face me when you enter the building. Isn't that what we do? Can we const for now? It's not really const though in the end. Okay. I think he lost the speed just slightly too fast for my taste. His turning velocity was maybe a little too high. He needs his walk animation. 1, 2, 3. He needs his talk animation as well. 2. 1, 2, 3. That should do it. Now we should have our Yoshi and then we just need to make him attack. How are you? How's your baby? She's doing very good. She has become a huge JoJo fan. Every day, when you have a phone out and she's around you, she comes up to you and goes, and she wants you to play Bloody Stream. Oh, he's missing his interaction. Do you have a stand yet? He's working on it, I think. I'm trying to think if the Piranha Plant's lullaby works. True. I don't think so. Let's see. Frame 29 to frame 33. Excellent. Hitbox in front and despawn next to it. We're just gonna do that. So now walks, talks and has become a little person. She is becoming a real human being. She is developing a soul. What age do you think children get their soul? You can't beat him. He can't beat you. He doesn't deal any damage. When they play Mario 64. Oh, I see. I thought that they don't count. I love how awful the song is. There's something special about being so awful. Let's see. 75 coordinates, it looks like. 45. They're born and lose it when they play the first time Revenge. Wow. Oh my god. Did you see the expose on Brodude? He got fucking exposed actually. You didn't? Dude. Let me show you. He got exposed on the official Project 64 GitHub website. Look at this. Project 64. Download links. Project status. What is this project about? Suggested games. Acknowledgements. Stay away from those romakers through arrogance, content stealing, financial scamming and reports of grooming. Things seem pretty bad out there. Yep. Brodude is number one worst hacker. He's right here alongside groomers, people that scam, B3313. You do not want to be in the B3313 files. Groomers. Something about mental health. Something about Hitler is in here. It's not a Reddit thread, it's a GitHub. It's so interesting. Dude, those are the... Look, you know the 10 commandments. First commandment is don't groom children. Second commandment is don't be Hitler. Third commandment, don't call Mario 64 bad. And Brodude broke the third one. That's why he's listed next to people that broke the other two. Why was it written there? It's a Project 64 fork, it's not the official Project 64. Damn, that didn't quite work. I guess I forgot this number. Imagine getting cancered in GitHub. It's real. I am beating up an old man. He threatened me. Yeah, that's the concussion that turns him into a pirate. Ew, he doesn't go back to normal. That's weird. I clearly see the code for going back to normal here. What the fuck? Also, is 85 offset not good enough? Looks like it should be more, maybe. We're not having RTY on the other one now. Yeah, something's weird. He didn't quite hit me right. The Reddit commandments. Actually, the Reddit commandments is like... Number one, be the girl in the argument. Number two, if you're in someone else's house, you have to listen to everything they say. Number three, you are not the asshole. I don't know how it works. Can I see my vision here? Also makes sense. I don't understand why he doesn't finish though. Why would the animation not be finished? That one's weird. He's just stuck here forever. 4037 is a typo. Who cares? That's not a typo. No, that's not a typo. That's the name for the symbol I gave it. You don't like the name I gave the symbol? I can rename it into AAABBBB if you want. Would that make you happier? Oh, he doesn't go back to walking. That's the issue. I see, I see, I see. But this works? This seems to work? I didn't see where the Goomba spawned. Fuck. Let's do this again. Am I just wrong on what this function does? XYZ seems correct to me. LeftUpForward seems also correct. Yeah, I don't know. That's bizarre. Fuck, the Goomba is where I am. But that works? It's just not doing the hitbox correctly. Interesting. Oh, I didn't set the interact tiles. I think with that we have the old man done. This new woke video game encourages children to beat up their grandparents for star hints. What happened to our traditional values? Honor your mother? Honor your dad? You don't have to honor your granddad? Wait, it actually doesn't say you have to honor your granddad if you think about it. He's beating the fuck out of me. I love this. Oh, come to think of it, I actually cannot hit him while he's doing that because I don't have the thing on. He's actually beating me because I made a programming mistake. There we go. Now we can beat him. Herbert versus Schlechtnacht. Oh, it's from Family Guy. That sounds like such a Family Guy name. Schlechtnacht. It's so brutal. Okay, so the first hint that he should give you is there's a secret door in the dojo and you can just walk into it to spin it. So one of these doors is going to be spinnable. Or maybe all of them. It's just brutal. Yeah, what if you can just fucking kill NPCs? Sure, why not. What if you could hunt down his entire bloodline and kill them all? Okay, so there is a secret star in the dojo. I'm just thinking about the best way to do this. So if there's a spinning door, I'm worried that people are going to try one of them and it's not going to work. And then they just give up. If every door is a spinning door, then the entrance is really working. But there'll be a different secret mechanic here. What if two of these doors, or three of these doors, all of these ones were secret doors that you could push in and go behind? And then there's an entire behind-the-wall area where you can just go and get the star? People give up after one door and they're just stupid and shouldn't bother. That's probably true. Alright, fuck it, let's just turn this door here into a pushable door then. Alright, this is an important DM. The sun is coming. Anytime now. We get a Mr. Rammstein. I've said this 15 times now. Got a messy desktop. My desktop is organized chaos. A person's tolerance towards disorganization is directly proportional to the size of their schlong. What if we round the corners a little just so it can actually turn? And to give the player a small extra hint. I mean, this isn't too obvious. Haven't been here for five minutes, by the way, love how you organized your desktop, dude. Yeah, thank you. Distinctive shitpost music. Is this a logically impossible structure? This seems very possible to me. We're gonna have it like this and then Mario pushes the door and it just does this. And then there's a star behind it. That looks really good to me, actually. Don't be like Dark Souls 3, it sucks having to do something that I may be serious about in the original. This should probably be pure wood behind it. We need some water. Honestly, the old man Yoshi didn't take long at all. I really love the new system for attacks that made this so easy to do. And all these new helper functions. My engine is great. What does it take on a German education system? The idea of splitting children into like Hauptschule, Realschule, Gymnasium is pretty good. They don't have that in Canada. So you're gonna have like people that can read with people that can't read, which is a big problem. I think. That being said, the German education system also fucking sucks. It was torture to get through it. Just like school was still too slow for my taste and there was nothing I could do to speed it up. So all the time I spent in school, I was just bored to death. And I wasn't allowed to do anything more interesting. I wish they'd just given me the university stuff for mathematics and told me here, you're bored, do that. At least I would have had something to do and I would probably know a lot more about mathematics had they done that to me. So that was a lot of wasted potential. This system sucks. But no, I bet had I just started learning about mathematics on my own during class, they would have been like, why aren't you paying attention to class? Oh my god, I love this. Yeah, I guess that's just always going to happen unless you have private lessons, right? But it could be improved a little bit, for sure. Yeah, I don't think I learned much English in school either. I don't think my English teacher was capable of speaking English. All right, well, I think that's all I want to do for today. We still gotta add the spinning wall and add the hint coach. But this part is done. So I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye.
