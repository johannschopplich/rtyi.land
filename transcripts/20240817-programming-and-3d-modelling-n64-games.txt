Hello Tomeisus, is that a new name, I don't think I've seen your name before, let me also open the correct Twitch YouTube stream, fuck, hello Lila3TV, you slept in today, you haven't done that in so long, I don't believe you, you seem like someone who sleeps in like everyday, hello Micron Online, how's it going, pretty well, I woke up at 7.30 today, look how responsive I am, so I was working on this area this week, this area looked terrible before, I'm still not like 100% on board with it, but I think it's a lot better, something about the colours here just look really good, I think this is really colourful, but the colours don't really pop, it's just like random colour pixels, clone vomit, is it not, the skybox, yes, the skybox is so much better than before, and it's now Yoshi's Island related, which is very very good, I hate the Minecraft blocks, this was Violet's idea, maybe the colours are ok but can be better, yeah, saying I was thinking that maybe the mountains should have like different colours on top, and not these bubblegum colours, this could be like a birdhouse, what if we made this birdhouse themed instead of what it is right now, no this is Yoshi's Island, let's make this look like a birdhouse, fuck it, you start in a birdhouse, you end in a birdhouse, I love this music too, the music's so good, I will send you 0.01% of the money the game makes off of sales, which is zero, hello Selton, should we do a Mario's missing remake, no, can you put a flower or two along the track to make it more colourful, I don't think more colourful would solve it, I think my issue is that the colours don't really match the vibe, this is like a cold green and a cold pink, but it should be like a warm one, although then again we are really above the sky, I also think that the floor here doesn't really match, some of it, like that, just looks like a tree crown, and then that just looks like a gigantic forest, I think it should be either or, hello Biobak, I'm gonna turn this into a birdhouse, I think that would be a little nicer, any OST wishes for today, hell yeah, ok, well I'm glad you're on board with it, I also don't like this, I think it should be either one of those two types of trees, that song was loud, oops, I also have my next video done already, that's the awesome part about having an editor, I can make so many videos now, I'm gonna try to make like one video every week, and then I will start increasing my upload frequency around December, small ones are better in your opinion, these ones here, yeah I think so too, Larry Link, thank you for the 16 months, what OST do we pick, guys I need some suggestions here, can you create a proper background on your penguin boss fight, do you mean the raven, if so then yes, yeah that makes sense, little coffee girl, hello Sully, I don't know what's up with me recently, but I've started to feel like my brain is really stupid for some reason, it's like sometimes it can't do the basics, like just yesterday I was thinking what's 32 multiplied by 37, and I couldn't come up with the answer, it's 118884, right, am I not stupid, 1184, it is 1184, but still, stuff like that keeps happening to me recently, and I don't like it, maybe I am getting old, maybe I was just stressed out for so long that my brain functionality is temporarily reduced, which I believe is an effect, that can happen, don't you fight with the ROM space when exporting HD textures, using HD textures like the background here do cost a little bit of ROM space, but this is 16 textures and they are all 0x900 each, so if you multiply those together you get 0x9000, which is 36 kilobytes, which is not too much, I don't want to alarm you, but my grandma is old and she couldn't have gotten 1184, but yes, 1.5 years ago you tried F2P, have you since then tried it again with more advanced models, I have not, it could be fun, I wonder if some more advanced models would find something, I don't know, I feel like recently a lot of the processes in my brain have become less conscious, like the answer just pops in, and I have no access to the information on how this answer was gathered, which I don't like, I hate that fast 64 movester thing, you see that Lilaa, fix it, I can't even see more basic stuff, well 12x12, everyone knows that's 144, and then you just need to add 12x5, which is 60, so you would get 204 very easily, a lot of these basic math questions are stuff that you can do very easily if you just have the confidence to do it, I don't think you need any special skill, you just need to actually stop panicking and start solving the problem, I need to make my game quieter, you're kinda dumb, that puts a wrench into things, your mod crashes when you do it, well that's not a ROM space issue, that's some other issue somewhere, you should add a bigger dimmer layer under each tree for that, how would that work out, let me try to understand what you mean, so you're saying I grab 15m, all of these, maybe move them up like 250 coordinates, shift D them, 150 down, ctrl dots, scale them up a little bit, like so, and then I make the bottom one dimmer, so I didn't need to multiply the alpha, and then I make the bottom one dimmer,  I'm still on process 14, if you're checking every day, you're wasting your time, duplicate a tree and make it whiter, so it looks more like the trees are fading, wait, whiter? I can make it whiter by fading the alpha a little bit, I made it darker now, because that's what you asked me to do, eh, the drawing order is inverted, but is that what you actually know, the drawing order is not inverted, is it inverted? it looks kinda correct, hello AndyGames, oh, it looks darker on the top now, because of the transparency, I think, I'm not using color leader, there will be a big hub world Leo, a hub world is very important for an R64 like, it's gluing the whole game together, yeah, I don't know why it looks like this, that's weird, he made it transparent instead of adding prim, well adding prim and making things transparent is the same thing, visually speaking, but I didn't even mean to make it transparent, I meant to make it darker, hmm, adding prim doesn't have drawing order problems, oh it does, this is a background, you need to draw this back to front, this doesn't have a z-buffer, but yeah, adding prim is in this context the same as just making it less transparent, because it's gonna fade into the background, dude, why does it not hit everything, you seeing this shit? there we go, it's too much darkness, I imagine you were thinking something like this then, let me just try it, leave them the way they were, but make the bottom layer whiter and more transparent, so it looks like they are going down in the fog, that's the idea, okay, how do you want the sides to be white, I see, I see, I see, oh are you sure you don't want this Biobak, I think this looks really good now, this is nice, good, I also fixed some of the UV mapping here, so you're actually sliding across the middle part, oh yeah, I also made an update to the sliding, so usually in vanilla Mario 64 the sliding is hard capped at 100 speed, so if you jump on a slide with more than 100 speed, you instantly lose all of it, I soft capped it at 95, so when you're above 95 you asymptotically approach 95 by like 5% every frame, that way it should feel the same when sliding normally, but when you slide on with a lot of speed, you will keep that speed, which feels good I think, but yeah, let's turn this into birdhouses, oh this is messed up, what if you got to this area using a carrot cannon, like Mario gets shot into the sky, I don't know, kinda sounds fun, yes, hello devpz, have fun at work, that's nice, do you wanna do that before we do the demo release or after? ok, just to recap this, I am thinking of releasing a demo with just course 1, and then in this demo, this is all about the new physics and stuff, we want reviews from the player, I will release this together with a questionnaire, this will be a google doc, and I will ask people stuff like, what do you think of the autorotate, do you like it, what do you think of the speed at which the pan changes, do you want more, do you want a higher max-min pitch, do you want a different default pitch, what do you like about Mario's physics, and any bugs you encountered, do you plan on releasing the demo? I am thinking of this in terms of video schedule, I have one video scheduled to come out in like 2 weeks, I am thinking of doing another video that will likely come out in around 4 or 5 weeks, maybe 5 weeks, and then the demo should be coming out in like 8 weeks, so 2 months is like the maximum we can do, ideally we'd have it done within the next 3 or 4 weeks. I am going to need an actual human to rewrite your questions, I will ask ChattyPT. Though I might double check this with an actual human, I know I am not very good at being an actual human. Nobody knows what a fucking pitch is. Not sure, there might be like a pilot in my audience, I don't know what that is. Oh my god, this is so annoying. What is this?  They have this song in Super Star Saga, that's fucking sick. Dude this is doing, wait what? What the fuck is it snapping? How is it snapping like this even though it's at the closest? It shouldn't be doing that. Nope, it definitely shouldn't be doing that. This is something cursed by a bug introduced into this file and I don't know how he did it. What should consider behavior is to release several versions of the game with changes and ask which they prefer but that's a lot of work. I don't think we need to do that because I mean if you do that then someone's gonna play the game twice and like the second time it's gonna be very different just through the fact that it's like the second time. So there's gonna be a lot of bias there too. Are we snapping to hidden geo? No no no no no no. It's snapping the center and not the closest. That's the issue. But I said the closest so I don't know what's going on. You see that? So I want the back of this to stay open. And then I want one line of lock on pop. This is so unworkable. Uh it was set to... I think I was still set to individual origins and that's why. Lilaa fix it Lilaa fix it! Lila, how does it feel to be the Cozies? I think I like this. Yo, thank you for the nine months Ggin Gaming Life. Thank you very much, very appreciated. Oh no... So we do this and then we put a roof on top. Have you seen what an actual birthhouse looks like? What about it? Also yes. It's birthhouse-inspired. Fine, I'll look at a birthhouse. Yeah, this is what I was thinking of. Like this. I'm actually done with this part here. I guess we need the camera invisible. It's usually solid wood and not blocks. That's fine, it's a big birthhouse. Of course there wouldn't be small birds living high up in the sky like this. That would be ridiculous. Check hydration? Sure. Hello poncho. Something is wrong with the edge splitting in this new blender version, I swear. It can't be like this. Should this go further down? Like this. I'm thinking maybe. So what's that bonus stream you promised? I didn't promise anything, I said big maybe. Unfortunately, I did not have time for a bonus stream. I was being extremely busy. You always say me. Yes. If you haven't noticed, I have a small child. That makes planning things really fucking difficult. How much is this? 9. It's closer to 8. Didn't before she was born too. Maybe I just didn't want a bonus stream. Is that what you wanted to hear? Maybe I just don't like hanging out with you guys as much as you like hanging out with me. Never thought about that. Did you do a child reveal anywhere? I didn't really publicly show her off, no. Do you guys want to see the child? Like, do you care? No, it's 8. That child is 8. No, that's 256. Stupid. Hello, handsome Maya. Do you want to see the child or not? That's a yes or no. Let me see here. This is a good one. Okay, so this is when she was just born. Sometimes she looks at you like this. Hawk Champ. And then all the time she looks at you like this. And so I look back to her like that. Why does she look like you? She looks like me. Maybe because it's genetically my child, Lila. I don't know. Do you plan to teach her German, English or ASM first? I only talk to her in German right now. Dude, what is this? This new Blender vertex thing. Dude, it's so annoying and bad. Oh my god. Who pushed this stupid change? Execute them. Do you guys know how we were upset about WebP? This is worse. Way worse. Dude, how did it break? It's now. Oh my god. I am losing it. How is it so bad? Lila, you are Portuguese and English. Well, clearly I don't know how to use Blender anymore either. Because they fucking broke it. For no reason. Did I do a pin? Yes, I did do a pin reveal. And you missed it. I like the little leaf here. I will keep it. What is going on lately? We have been making a little bit of a romhack. You know how when you ask someone the time and they answer like oh, it's 15 minutes until quarter to five? That's how French people just count all the time. I don't know.        Wrong.  Okay, here's four times 20 plus three reasons why you are wrong. I have been speaking French for one times 20 plus seven years. And you are telling me how French works. This is unbelievable. It's just words. I don't understand. I don't actually do calculations. Maybe the memes were wrong then. Who would have thunk? The log cabin very realistic. All the logs would roll off with that level of support. Troll face. Yeah. The log cabin own very unrealistic. You are so true, bestie. When you are in an argument but you misspelled something, you fucking die. Our weekday is about using numbers like third, fourth, but we still don't know. We start at second and then after six we use Saturday and Sunday. Sunday used to be the start of the week for some people, right? Some people still say it's the start of the week, which doesn't make any sense. Because the reason we have Sundays is that God rested on the last day. So how come Sunday is the first day? That's literally blasphemy. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I  I I I I I I I I I I       I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I  I I I I I I I     I That's like letting someone who knows how to murder people by looking at them roam around free. You wouldn't want that. Modernity sucks because now, oh I see, because PS1 it's easy and now you need like 2000, yeah. I guess that's the burden that comes with all the extra features. With great power comes great responsibility, or whatever Spider-Man says. We last 20 hours left to live, she forgot her vitamin D. Can you say hi to me? It's all I ask. Hello, dang. What happened? Is this the Skibidi update? Um, no. This should be good, yeah. I think I like this. For the collision map. Oh. Oh well, I think that's fine. Let's see if this all works and then we can go on. I say hello every week in chat, but you don't say hello back half the time. I don't see it all the time. I don't see every message that goes through my chat. Unfortunately. Especially if something is like not a question addressed to me or something that seems important. My brain just kind of filters it out. I'm not one for formalities. Do you see N64 Emulator? If I have to debug my code, like if it's like a difficult bug, I use NEMU. In NEMU you can just like look at the code. Right, like I see all the code here. It's in assembly, so if you can't read assembly, too bad. But I think it comes with a GDB debugger extension that I just haven't set up yet, because I hate technology. What made you want to do a native instead of holding off on the full release? I want more data on gameplay. I want more feedback for how people think the physics work and how the camera works and stuff like that. So that when I release the full game, we know for sure people like the camera and the physics. This is fun. I should put coins up there. So those RS. RS fucking sucks, dude. Use it, all right. Let's use RS, guys. I'm sure this will not have any issues whatsoever. Actually, RS doesn't fucking suck. I shouldn't say that. It's a good emulator, but. Up in the rum. What are you doing? Hello, are we still live? Did my stream crash? Nope, my OBS is not crashed. Okay. Yeah, use RS. Use RS is what Lilaa said. Now what? I'm stuck. I guess I can kill the RS process. There we go. Now it works. Ah man, now that I finally loaded into my game in RS, I'm sure nothing will go wrong. Sure looking forward to it. Playing my game in RS. I see some flickering. Uh-oh, uh-oh. I'm sure glad to be playing in RS and not Nami right now. This one's useless. Useful though. I like this. This is very helpful. Please report Rusky Nose. The game is flickering? Really? Good. So Hello, Paul. So I think I should do this just for vertex coloring. So So It's too dark at the top. That's funny Biobak. Especially with the context of Lilaa losing her shit over this texture. So How did they do that to the colors? That made no sense. Yo, ZeroVault. Thank you for the rate. Welcome to the stream. Donkey Kong Zone. Nope, just a random bird nest. The important bird thing. Bird, uh, house. How have you been? Pretty well. I had a daughter spawned in just four weeks ago.  Thank you, ZeroVault. I feel like just for the cat emoji, you just got knocked down a pack, Biobak. Will the cat emoji influence that? I don't know. It would influence most people. I guess not you. So Really, uwu? How do you read out that emoji? It just reads like uwu to me. You can read it. You make the face. How do you make the face? That's right. How do you make the face, dude? Get on camera. Make the face for me. If you're so good at making the face, why don't you come and show me? Can't your face reveal I'm ugly? Yeah, that's unfortunate.  And you? So Yeah, I think this is fine now. I want to add the line of five coins or something on top. Maybe 15 or something. I have seen Lilaa's face. Oh, careful, Biobak, she's 17. I know you didn't say anything bad, but you know, you never know. So This was not about me, B-Turk. I was helping someone else out. I'm sorry, I will never say anything positive about a 17 year old again. That's safer, dude. Oh. Mar gets a Kaczynski Shack to retreat from industry, society and its consequences. True. I'm Kace, I'm 18 Kace, feel free. See, Biobak, there is someone you can call pretty without getting locked up. Interesting, where are the other coins? Right there, interesting. I think I changed the pitch in the wrong direction. So if why does it not rotate there we go this should do it hopefully hello w5 so the lockhouse you should add one lock between the rooftops to lock even instead of stretching the locktokitchen should between the rooftops you mean between the left and the right side of the roof so that there's like a flat top i'm not using the model i created with a hex editor i'm using something much better um the model i use now has some hd textures it has some glove detail it has a few less triangles because nowadays we can use fast 64 which can do all the stuff that i did hex editor without any of the really really difficult parts maybe i'm rotated on the wrong axis since you're not 18 yet skilling just tells you to die i don't think i don't think that age matters to skill anymore i'll be honest so yeah i have heard the news that skillenio really hates you now what did you do to him Lilaa no no someone what in my staff house you know the in my discord and the staff someone posted skillenio is just hating on Lilaa we should probably ban him if he comes here and i mean skillenio is already permabanned so that's how i know about this but i don't know what he did or what you did to him wow What he just randomly started asking you to suicide out of nowhere? What did you do to him? Why is he so upset at you? How is he even still in the hacking scene? The last time he did anything was like, what, 7 years ago? Since then he's just been shitposting and trying to get people to like him for 7 years without doing anything? Who's Samantha? Oh, you think it's Gilenyo, but you don't actually know. Brack? Oh, I think I remember that name. There we go. Now you get plenty of coins for going here. Isn't that nice? I still don't like the colors here. I think they don't pop enough. The hills just need like different colors or something. Damn, can you imagine being allowed to just pick your own name and then still misspelling it? Did Moe agree with Redacted? Yeah, Redacted was saying just like a cannon that goes to the sky, which I kind of don't hate. How would we make this cannon look? I'm up for making a change, by the way. Look at it now that I have one lock in the center. I see what you mean. You're thinking, I'm willing to give it a try, but I'm not 100% confident in it yet. Like, so I kind of like it. Maybe not a cannon, but a big vine to the sky. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.   I don't know.  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You know how it would look funny though if this was just a carrot and then there was like a door entrance to it and you would walk into the door and then the top of the carrot like this part with the leaves would just open up and wish out of it. That would look hilarious. The problem is then we have two carrots right next to each other and I don't like that. It makes this house less special. I like how special this is. Dude how long is this song? 30 minutes? I'm not listening to this for 30 more minutes. Do we have more belly variety anyway? No, it's too late for that. Okay, the vinyl except it moves up as you crawl. No. The reason I don't like the vinyl is also because it would like you would just climb half the path here instead of going there, which doesn't feel right to me. That was definitely a schmoof. I want the vines to keep being connected to this. Although admittedly this part of the level is a little weird. The fact that this exists at all. Maybe I should move one of the Yoshi coins here. Hello Portal Geist. See ya, Pachu. Although I guess it's kind of neat that you can just walk here if you want. Unless it's a little bit of a shortcut. Can you give the bouncing mushrooms a different color than the normal ones? Yes, they do have a different color here. If these colors look the same to you, you might be colorblind. Although you should be able to tell the difference in brightness here. Even then, I don't want this to be like the first thing you find, Zaur. Like imagine you spawn in here and that thing is just a gigantic barrel. I don't want the player to just walk on there and fall in or whatever. The game is mostly colorblind friendly. We're looking for colorblind people a little bit. And deaf people too. Gonna add the grass plants? Possibly. But probably not before the demo. We have to think about this carefully. It can't stay a pipe, I agree. Are there mushroom cannons in Mario? Or do they not exist? I think there are. Oh, they look like this. They're bunnies, they are. I'm gonna hole under the stump instead of a pipe. Oh, but a pipe is like, it teleports you. This is like you stay in the same location. Just go somewhere else. That's a seam. Wow, I need to fix that. How is this happening? I see. Something extremely funny happened here. What? Okay, cool. Remember when we ran out of fire level? That, but with a small vine that grows to the sky when you pull on it. Couldn't even bring a little bud for the axe. You don't want the player to reach it. Wait. This guy. It should be this guy. We should have this guy in the game anyway. Because he's from Yoshi's Island. And we're returning to Yoshi's Island. We'll have him here. And then you just jump on the leaves. Who is this guy? Do you not know this guy? Ah, come on. This is what happens on Yoshi's Island. That's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking.    It's perfect. Hello, RetroN2. I wouldn't know. I've never played Final Fantasy X. So, what's this? So, okay, what do we turn this into? Do we just remove it? And have there be a flower bud here? I have not made a box art for RTY yet. But I do want to make a box when it's done. We could remove basically the entire tree stump. Have it just be like a little ring. Like a hollowed out tree stump. And then we have the bud here. This will connect to the tree stump. And then what do you do to the bud to make it grow? That's the question. Do you just pull on it? How would you think to grab it is the question. Let me make a backup of this. So that we can experiment with this guild free. I guess I'm 64. A button pop up. I guess 64 is so funny. I'm going to start calling it slopper 64. Until they make it less funny. I don't know. Rabbit tiles here. That would be the easiest way, yes. I don't know. I was thinking something like this. Is this a bird? It is a bird. This is probably better anyway, because people had trouble finding the slide here. To the point where I put up a stupid sign here. And I guess I can remove the sign now. Which I enjoy very much. You know what, we don't even need this anymore. I do like this one though. When you said stop, it reminded me of OnlyUp64 you made. When ChainedTogether64. ChainedTogether64 would be such a good one to make. But I would have to properly split screen and multiply and everything. It would have to be a PC part mod, let's be real. Why? So you can probably play it together. The online multiplayer. Or do you want to be chained to NPCs? Could be something like that, yes. Dude, editing the level after you've made the collision map is the worst. What the hell is going on? Let me take a quick look. See how this feels. My mom is on a two day trip thing and she only comes back tomorrow. Hey! Oh, that's bad. It's a good thing usually. Teenagers being home alone, they like that shit. Where's the updates to... What's that word? Well, someone else will have to write a message before I can read that word. Because YouTube chat is awesome. Oh. The collision map is a little fucky. It looks good though. I like how this looks. What are the updates to this stage about? Oh, I see. We're going to increase the roleplay a little bit. So hopefully you're going to feel more like you're actually helping the bunnies and stuff. We're going to make some stuff look a little bit better. Other than that, not really much. Okay, so we do want this flower here, for sure. The question is, how do you spawn it? And how will it look? And then once you've spawned it, how do you get up? I don't know.     I could just make it... Make alternating jumps left and right to get up. That wouldn't be too bad. Only adults everywhere? It's too late for that. I don't know. I'm wondering if there's a bucket next to it that you can knock over. Nah, that's too contrived. I want something really simple. Something that just happens. That's kind of the difficulty with Mario 64. When you make stuff like that, you can't just turn it into puzzles. You have to make it feel really natural. Just pull on it? Just pull on it is the easiest. The problem is, how do you make the player know that they have to pull on it? That's my issue with that. And yes, the bunny can say that. But ideally, this level should be beatable without ever talking to anyone. It's supposed to be an game where you actually have to compress the movement, so that's not too bad. I think that's the reality of the game.      Some of them are good too, but there are a lot of side quests and you can do it. The tutorial bunnies are for mechanics that are useful throughout the entire game, and they're specifically colored. We're not doing that for a mechanic that's helpful in one level. The bunny pulling it but being too... The bunny doesn't have hands. It's kind of a fun idea though. There could be just a bunny standing around it and just jumping next to it. Oh, so you're thinking an animated butt that's just kind of weaving back and forth. Forth okay what if we do this we have an animated flower bud here just like a single leaf and it's weaving back and forth and when you get close it gets excited and it animates faster next to it is the bunny the bunny is hopping in front of it he goes wake wake wake wake wake wake and um since the flower reacts to mario coming close the bunny can make the goomba alert sound once to be like wow the thing moved then when you talk to the bunny he's like i think this butt wants to come out but i'm not strong enough to pull it out and then you try it and then when you try it mario does the bowser animation and you have to either like hold the stick back or mash a to pull it out and then once you pull it out mario flies backwards and the flower comes out like really fast it grows just like in yoshi's island and then you can just jump from leaf to leaf to get up i think that way we have everything covered here is a flower bud in the bunny house this bud has one leaf weaving back and forth mario comes close the animation speeds up this is something like if the animation speeds up the bunny jumps in place and makes the noise you can grab him with bowser animation when you get close and hold stick away from the butt or mash a slash b to pull it and let go this is too complicated if this moves they will punch it what complication does this add this is just more hints i will just teleport the player to the slide if you go high enough mario will fade out and go and appear at the house and then this house is just going to be it's going to be like this but the flower is going to be here so you're going to spawn here with the flower looking in um and leave turn the flower to the slide on your face how annoying for how's this annoying hey guys okay explain how this is complicated or annoying i don't understand what you're saying at all the flower will not have dialogue uh it's also not a tutorial  i need an explanation for how this is complicated or annoying or otherwise i cannot figure this out you're gonna have to jump from leaf to leaf like at least six times for this to feel natural well ideally you would jump on the flower before that so that the flower moves up with you how big will the leaves be anyway that won't be big enough no i don't want everything in this level to be about risking people my left feet since i'm going to use the blood for something simple the flower moves players try to punch it locked into grabbing animation they've got the joystick and out and then plucks the plant yes that's part of my plan too the only thing i'm adding is a bunny in front of it that animates when the flower starts moving faster when you get close i'm just adding some visuals to it that makes this look better and also like a minor hint there's fall them is sour but what if the player doesn't jump on the flower in time then they have to jump on the leaves we can try to 3d model the flower first just so we are like 100 sure this is good will this be a mechanic that reappears in other levels possibly i'm not gonna exclude it it's probably especially in the overworld i would say so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna 3d model the flower we're gonna make sure that the movement is fine and then we're gonna figure out a way that we can animate the flower to grow into the big flower if there was a pearl object instead that's also possible we might have to make this relatively poor like because otherwise it's going to be way too many triangles okay the pipe is still here good yeah it's a good mechanic to have it reappear dark ways it's not gonna lead to a pipe you're not gonna see the top of the flower from the bottom we want this flower to be huge also if we do this then we have to remove the pipe at the end which is fine because there's no more 100 coin star so i don't mind that the flowers come and the stars come the pipe come i don't know what's today so yes no 100 coin stars i hate 100 coin stars in hex most of the time so oops now i have it open multiple times so well so it's very in the original game which we can actually use to make the leaves closer together it's replaced by yoshi coins you just need to collect six or you can collect six of them and they can be collected anytime while you're doing another mission so you don't lose any progress from collecting them so no there are no lives in the tech  just gonna use this for now oh that's ugly i can't use this for now hello holly are you overhauling quest one again we're only making very small changes let me shake effect when the camera's growing uh when it comes out for sure i don't know if it will be persisting the whole time it's growing uh yes it's for the yoshi game it's because i want to release another demo holly that's why i want to polish this up real quick god it needs to be so big to work yeah i mentioned in my last video that i want to do another demo so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so yeah i regret doing all that let me, let me, okay, let me redo this 1, 2, 3 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so every third one 1, 2, 3 and then 1, 2, 3 i should pick the innermost ones, so 1, 1, 2, 3 no, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, here here's what i will do that was an interesting way to make that damn, now i need a leaf that looks similar to the yoshi's island one this one i guess it works yeah that's good i think um of course this is not the final lecture so do not start crying just yet calm down luna don't cry yet if you need to call your native code from java that sounds more like an issue with your development stack and not something with every modern development surely there's a different way so so how annoying is it to get up here is what i'm wondering there's no way unless you use a third-party library or engine this is the intended way oh that sucks so the second one is more than 120 stars and the middle will definitely have to be non-solid if we went with this also yes this will be annoying and way too difficult hello shady kitty life thank you for the prime okay what's a less annoying way to do this this might need to be bigger too Looks too skinny. It is a little skinny, yeah. Oh, the brown fun particles are ugly. What happened there? Wait, that's more important right now. I have to fix this. Did I change something about this? Does this need to be 6? That's way better. Oh yeah, that's nice. Nice. Does this one got 30 FPS too? Nice. Hello, Aura Sphere. Just making everything bigger? Not good. What are you cooking, AZ? I just fixed some circle thing. We're still cooking the plant here. This plant is very annoying to climb, so I don't like it. We can't keep it. The suggestion to make it bigger, I think, is reasonable. But if you have it just twice the size, I think it's no longer gonna be easy to climb it. Lilaa, okay, you didn't offer an alternative. Of course, I was gonna put it in first, see how annoying it is, and then see if we can mitigate the annoyance. I think that's a perfectly reasonable way of handling this. You warned me, but you didn't tell me what to do to fix it. Lilaa, here's a warning. You're gonna be hit by a baseball bat in your face tomorrow. But I'm not gonna tell you how to avoid it. Is it now your own fault if you get hit? Or is it my fault because I'm hitting you with a baseball bat? Exactly. Make it spin upwards when you're in it, so you're climbing faster. I like that, yeah. So it's like a permanent plant. Like a permanently growing plant. And it's like an automatic elevator. Now let's do it in depth. Case truth are there. Pay me money first? If I make it permanently spinning upwards, then this is like a decent size for the leaves as well. These leaves are very temporary. These are not gonna be actually in the game. So we're gonna have it permanently spinning upwards. Which means we also need to fade it out towards the top somehow. We can just make it fade into a color. That would work. And I'm thinking of fading it into the fog. So then we would have to fade it in by some... I have an idea. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I think this will work out, yeah. I'm confident in what was flowing though. It's annoying we can just make it a pole. I don't think it will be annoying if it's spinning automatically. I have no money, I won't say anything related to money. Okay, fine, I'll take truth. But I will give you absolutely zero guarantee that I will actually answer. This is just the same song over and over. I mean, if it's too annoying to make... Oh, okay, yeah. My climbing sucks, but you can just make it cutscene where it climbs the vine. That's cringe. That's cringe.       That's the issue here. Why would I tell you that? I don't want to get murdered. Because it's true that there you have to... Oh, I have to? Really? What happens if I don't? Didn't think that far, huh? Oh, no. We're gonna have to fix this everywhere. You get to the dark realm? Well, I guess it's too late for me. I'm going to the dark realm. Okay. Dude, could you imagine if they made more good Dragon Ball episodes? That would be so awesome. I've been waiting for like 20 years. I have no idea, Adriano. I don't remember TTYD that well. I can barely remember any of the partners. TTYD and Paper Mario 64 kind of blur into the same game in my brain. I cannot tell them apart. Ah, this is not a good texture for this. This is easy to find. Nova Scotia is small. Well, actually I never go outside, so how would you ever find me? Bne, true. Branch not equal? This one looks kinda nice. It's the same texture but higher resolution. Of course it would look nice. Second image from the central gate is daring. Interesting. Is it just a picture of one of those strandless streams? Probably yes. It doesn't have to be perfect on the first try. Well, it does have to fit into texture memory. Let's just edit this one here. I'm sure I can make this work. I think we can turn this into an i8, which would be amazing. Let's try it again. Since this is gonna be a special 2-cycle type texture. Where did I save it? RNGP. Oh, Lilaa hates when I do this. She does not like this at all. That looks very HD. Oh yeah, I think I changed my Photoshop into English a while ago. Let's try it again. It's German. Oh my god, that looks so nice. Let's try it again. Let's try it again. Let's try it again. Let's try it again. Let's try it again. Let's try it again. Let's try it again.  Okay, for the fade into alpha currently, I have a hard time coming up with something. I was thinking maybe we should just use shade alpha and use the primitive alpha to move the threshold of where the blue is. But that doesn't work for everything. So that is an issue. The second idea would be to use the good old trick that we use for HUD. Where the shade alpha slowly reduces from 256 down to 32 at the bottom. And then we multiply the alpha of the stick with primitive color alpha and use cutout rendering. That way it slowly would be cutting off. But then the leaves will look a little weird. But that should be fine. Yeah, we'll do that. Actually, that's fine. Let me just... Flower spins and moves permanently up. There is the piece is active at any given time. The top one slowly reduces pin alpha and uses the HUD's cutout rendering with the shade alpha gradients to slowly disappear into the sky. And then when you look up, you will just see it disappear. Oh, actually, no, there's no alternative. That's what we'll do. But we will do this off stream or a different time. I have things to do. And I need to take a rest. So I'll see you guys in the next stream or the bonus stream if I do one this week. I don't know. No promises. But until then. Bye.
