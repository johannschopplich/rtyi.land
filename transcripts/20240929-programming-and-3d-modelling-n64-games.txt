Hello. Hello. Hello. Any chat? Microphone is on.  Good. Hello, Nintendo for life. That is the wrong audio output. Hello. Oh, Nobby is here. I keep seeing your name everywhere. What did I miss? Hello, Xdenik. Recently, I was working on these shy guys here. They are going to be chasing Mario down. That is what I did this morning. I have known you for at least some of my entire life as well. It is Minecraft life day? What is Minecraft life? I have started playing Minecraft for the first time recently with Zeina. We are like four and a half hours into the game. So far, it has been pretty cool. The sides of the platform seem a bit annoying. What do you mean? These grass platforms here? Or the styrofoam? It is where they make all the death threats in Minecraft real. That is the bad guy. I have decided find a video schedule. We are going to make a video explaining BLJ first and then I'm gonna make a video where basically I re-release the missing link for some updates to the game to make the game better and to like get a video of it back online after Nintendo took it down and then hopefully we're gonna do the first one remake. I was thinking of making more like Mario 64 facts videos if the BLJ one does well. Stuff like one obscure fact about every level in Mario 64 which you know I think there could be a few interesting things. I think that's the kind of slop that YouTube viewers love and I think we can get famous that way. I also have a song for this level that I want to show you guys later and I want you guys to evaluate it with no preconceived notions of what I think about the song so we can get an accurate assessment. Alright, we're listening to this now. It's not a slop, just factually annoying yap. Yeah, but there's a lot of videos like that on YouTube and they're all like some 2% interesting relevant thing you watch just to pass the time not because you're desperately wanting to do it. One thing that devs meant... One bug with every Mario 64 enemy. I'm making a note. I'm making a note for that. One bug with every Mario 64 enemy. Oh, we have infinite content dude. Shoot Nintendo for life. I don't know what pin splash is. Panin's content is like very scientific and that's like good. I don't think he really cares about the interviews. I think he cares about Mario 64 as like a scientific thing to explore. Like he would be the type to write a PhD thesis on Mario 64 while on my channel I would be like the magazine reporting on the PhD thesis, but like I would be a good one. I wouldn't be a sloppy one. True Biobak. Yeah, I program in C++ almost every day. It's literally my job. 120 facts about Half-Life 2. Yeah, true. That does sound like that. How fast would he be walking here? 0x600, how much is that? Like 1500 and the speed would be like 30. So maybe we subtract 15 times the phone velocity. So by the way for the symbol guys, I was thinking they have one attack. They kind of run at you like Goombas would and then when they are close, they're gonna do a dive jump. Are you planning on doing another stream this week? I don't know if I can. Tomorrow I'm gonna have to go for like a Thanksgiving thing and it's gonna suck, but I have to go there. I have a lot of work next week. The thing is I have a lot of like benefits piled up. So I want to take a few more days of work whenever I can and do extra streams, but I don't know if I can. Oh, I see you, Biobak. Yeah, maybe I can find... Oh, maybe I can find time... No, I can't. Maybe I can find time in the evening, like three or four hours later than my usual stream times. I think performance would be gained now. Connect switching? What is that? So is every video gonna be like the one about grass from now on? No, nothing is going to be like the one about the grass. Do not worry about that. I'm still gonna be strict and to the point. I'm just gonna make more generic videos that are not just for tech nerds. Segment 98? Yeah, I know. It's not Duke's, it's from Mario World when you switch the level. Hello, X-Links. Does Teamwork know you do this as a hobby? Yeah, they actually hired me because of this. And I think most of the people I work with think it's cool, but I don't know. Probably a lot of them don't care. Oh, unsend retro later, but it would be a mess if you make changes to the file. Yeah, now we have to do it all in one go. No, I'm gonna try to do bonus streams, Biobak. Maybe I can slot in a stream, like do half a workday, do a stream and then do the other half of my workday. On Tuesday? So we could try that. Oh yeah, Biobak, can you send me a cool screenshot of the level? I wanna make a Patreon post about the demo releasing soon. Sure, four lines of code. The first line will be Wild True. The second line will be Play Mario 64. And then the third line is just a closed bracket. Three lines even. Any OST wishes today? Wait, is my Discord saved to open? It is. Okay, no one cares about this. Good. Mario 64 were calculated in Wild True. So now they should be charging me down. I still have to program them dying. I don't know how I'm gonna make their death animation. Are you putting all of the graphical behavior scripts in one script? I'm putting them in one inc.c file. The inc.c files are part of a different compile unit altogether. Or they're part of the same compile unit in the engine folder. I always keep all the behaviors for one thing close. Because if you do that, then there's gonna be less cache misses, which is good. Thanks for watching. Any OST wishes? Today the stream is 180p. I always stream under the exact same settings. Not listening to a single song. I need an OST suggestion. I'm not listening to a single song.    So you should be turning around as soon as I'm far away. What the hell? What the hell? Wait, does the stream still say normal maps? Okay, I need to change that. Um... There we go. Hello, ThePerfectMario64. He's got regular maps? Too late. Okay, since no one suggested an OST, I'm picking, um... Mario RPG OST. Mario RPG OST. I hear so much about Satisfactory recently. Is it like a new game? I thought the game released like 10 years ago. But suddenly everyone's talking about it. Procedurally generated texture? I do have a few procedurally generated textures and they look pretty good. For example, for light rays or maybe like rain, stuff like that. Dude, that guy was really aggressive. Holy shit, that's maybe a bit too much. That's fucking terrifying. Can release 1.0 on SNES? Oh, I see. Okay, for some reason it doesn't unfocus correctly though. That should do it, right? Two steps ahead, yep. Procedurally generated textures can be pretty good. Um... Wait, I can show you one cool procedurally generated texture. I will show it just for you. I will show it just for you. Speaking of two steps ahead. Can we all agree that what Nekocado Avocado did is Giga Cringe? And not based? Yeah. You see these walls? How they're twinkling? That's a procedural texture. And I like it a lot. I like it a lot. Uh, right, I wanted to check the Chai guy. Whoops. Let's go. Dude, how does it... How does he notice me twice? That's a problem. So he notices me once, and then he notices me again as soon as I go off. Oh, because I set his action to 1 and not 0. That's why. That's why.  They just cannot turn around afterwards. They really chase you, though. Holy shit. Yeah, it's also 128x64 texture, so there's no way it would be repetitive. No, Judy, he cannot. Grinding on rails is just kinda like a slide. Mario's always been doing that. Or riding a shell. Mario's also always been doing that. I need to think of a way to kill these guys. The thing is, if we make them squish, it wouldn't look like a thimble anymore. Because a thimble is hard material. So we need a different way of doing that. How about we just make them unbeatable? Honestly, I'm okay with that, too. I probably should have thought about this beforehand. And I need to make it so that the light reflection on the hat properly moves when you turn the camera. Or when they turn. We kick them and they temporarily fall over. And then what? I mean, I like that idea. Knock them into the abyss by kicking them like bullies? Oh, that is a cool idea. Kick them while they're on the side, they will roll. Oh my god, this is getting so complicated. Would anyone figure out to do that? Actually, they wouldn't need to figure out to do that. If we just made it so that you can kick them, that would be enough. Could make it so that you kick them once, and then they kinda get knocked back. And then you can kick them again, and they would get knocked back again. Wouldn't this be more realistic if this was fighting? Life Plague Origated as opposed to Free Fly? What? Do you work in a cardboard factory or something? How do you know that much about cardboard? What do these words even mean? Knocked down? Cardboard PhD in chat, yeah Okay, we could make them knock down a ball the problem is how do I do the animation Maybe it would be better if I just made an animation for them to be like knocked back and then they go They are green strash Well, they're not weightless death symbols they're made out of metal You know what I should do a Position and then also Just die Just give up at that point how far down can you go here? 1,000 okay That point they just die Hello, mohawk, man Love watching your videos. That's cool. Yeah, I've been streaming for six years or so Maybe they roll in a cone kind of way Yeah, that's kind of similar to what Biobak suggested. So you were thinking just like They fall down like this We can do that we can just make them fall like this and then if you kick them again they like Roll this way So many little but that star is thicker But it's still free play as in one day in between two other layers where some other cardboard texture sides have way more layers I think it's probably an aesthetic choice Yeah, I think it's an aesthetic choice So you're thinking You're basically saying to do This I can I can kind of agree with this. Yeah I Don't get the other textures, it's all the same texture. Hello retro gaming is awesome These cardboard or just like a I mean like here that's like a five play It's kind of the same Community knocking them off their feet and they're stuck like that But you can roll them around and walk on them. This would lead to some sick puzzles Well, that's like 60 poly wait what Why are we talking about polygons I thought you were talking about your vmaps Maybe even this I I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about Okay, so knocking them like this and then rolling them Doable But I feel like that would be weird Because now they have a weird hitbox that has to be like circular Unless we give them a polygonal hitbox, which is even weirder I don't know. I don't know   Yeah, I think so dude that's what I was thinking free By the way, can you send me a screenshot of the level? Um So I can post about that real quick, why are you still working on that trying to make a pretty one I was just trying to see  What does apply at this point I actually think the best thing to do would be A much simpler just they get knocked back a little bit and they shake it off I think I should have helmet with lights on them or I should catch them with a big net Now we're just random generating ideas So If it's getting to my things for modding I just started and then I was modding Let's do the scientifically accurate head shake 25 and 10 frames how about 20 and 9 frames And then 15 and 8 frames And then And nine frames uh seven frames How's this That doesn't feel like shaking the head at all Thoughts on this teaser screenshot for the demo Can you take the picture again but unfuck your lens first How does how does a head shake look like It steps a lot more sudden than I'm making it doesn't it So And there's the point for hype but it just looks like the level they already knew at that point It doesn't get anyone hyped, right? Yeah, that's pretty normal Are you tech just always hype? I don't think so. Not even for n64 audiences Dude, I need to look at a head shake slow motion So So Okay, there's nothing good on here So I'm gonna meet up with my vtubing girlfriend you're meeting in january. Oh, that's cool. I hope it goes well So I think he's rotating too far and too slow. All right, let's try this again Let's try to just do it by vibes instead of like actually doing any math on this So Something like this maybe It looks a lot more like shaking it off I think Whatever it's fine. I'm probably not gonna have the final animation here anyway, and someone else gonna make a better one But it works from now to illustrate the concept So Hello pablo Hello also gamer have valve for recent chat So So Are you finishing the engine into have look at us now Well, I never gave a release dates fortunately so that's all 100 on you And no, we do not have a level for this name for this level yet people were making suggestions but nothing I was 100% sold on yet This is the craft worlds You Colorado USA I could I am capable of doing that I Should decouple move jaw from fogged velocity here Cardboard yes, Calvert. Oh, yeah Hello chicken gamer What about minty Course 14 as a whole name? Well, it's not a minty level Hello matter. It's going well Colossal crafty cliffs That's a decent one But it feels wrong, right Colossal crafty. I feel like adjectives have a certain order in English and neither one of the two orders makes sense to me  CBT music what This should not come back already come but crafting chaos by chaos Hardboard for Oh So I'm very shy guys, yeah still not fitting You There's one castle true It's also the whole Egypt It's a bunch of different biomes in here I think the animation is too long actually They are very chunky, what are you working on? I'm working on the symbol guys. They're shy guys made out of a symbol and some cardboard I'm working on the symbol guys. They're shy guys made out of a symbol and some cardboard I Am open to name suggestions There was someone that gave me a long list of like 30 different names and a few of them were pretty good Maybe I can find the DM present the names to you Handmade heights and paper craft peaks. Those were the two I liked You I suppose to wiggle. Yeah, they kind of wiggle to work Yeah, it is not all paper so hand-made heights kind of like it And Be cool if we could put a rhyme and an alliteration into it somehow handmade height blake i don't know you know what i mean what if none of the assets in there would that look poopy i didn't see anything well it stopped when i attacked then that's the bug right now i know why it didn't work because i didn't change the animation that's true an endgame stage that would be a lot cooler destroying them is kind of not fun beating them has to be more fun than this i think it needs to knock mario back too from them i think that's the solution that needs to knock them back more kind of like how the bullies do it and we compute mario's velocity here you can't just set it to zero you know what equal force this makes sense let's see how this feels flip them over i was thinking they should work more like bully fights where you kick them off the thing oh what the hell oh um i use wsl to compile the game so oh that's fun i like that that feels nice so no coin though that's true i could just make it so that when they fall down they spawn according to the last position they had when they were up there although actually that would be a little bit painful to program i have a little bit of a problem with the direction they're flying oh they also should be attacking mario after that like always so fountain springs i like that idea you mean those they will not just act like bullies they will also have a dive attack at the end when you just dive at mario but you kind of kill them like bullies that's could be what it is oh i want to put some shy guys on this island here where we will have to do peach rescue okay you don't need to copy paste that i already read it the first time calm down but i appreciate the insight truth be told i'm not someone who cares about names for things i know what it does and it's good enough for me but i will need a name to tell people on what it is and i don't want a hundred million people getting upset at me going hey that's not a normal map a normal map yeah don't worry i get it if it's an anisotropic map that's good okay maybe that's what i should call it the problem with that is that's not a word people know so they won't be as hyped for it as if i said normal maps found some sneaky triangles and i snuck them in this time not Biobak and there's probably a lot of these so so sometimes i make a flat surface bonding like a trampoline no but you have to specifically program it to do that i have a few servers to do that i actually have a whole library to do that because i had to do that a few times there was something i was unhappy about with the shy guys i forgot what it was this is definitely one of the things i was unhappy about but i don't think this is what i was thinking of let me look at the shy guys again maybe i'll notice when i look at them shyness or it could be a cellophane and wriggling trampoline but you can just pass for it let me give it a choose oh i see yeah that well you would have to have a shit ton of triangles to make the thing bend correctly if it's such a big waterfall you know right so we want to update the home position if they're too far away from home i see deeper it happens so i prefer brackets here just just makes me feel warm and cozy and i think we got the shyness pretty good now i'm still gonna add the dive attack to this you know something mushroom loves also stretch by himself but the sprites can maybe you can also do that i can absolutely do that problem is doing that uh reduces the resolution of those assets too so i need to make a low rs version of each sprite the shy guys completely deactivate when they fall off the moon right i wanted to make it so that after you hit them once they start chasing you no matter what so now i also made it so that they update their home position when to like abduct them so now this guy should be roaming around here show me how you roam baby oh i guess he updated his position once but not twice the position i guess should only update during action zero or no it should update after chasing here that's when it should update and then yeah basically whenever we go back to base action it should update i should make a function this is better we don't need the comments who cares i'm just like having it consistent there we go if you don't understand what have you planned next making my own game yes i am german or i used to be german i moved to canada in 2021 i'm so glad i don't live in germany anymore oh god all the bureaucracy bullshit in germany has ruined my quality of life even now that i no longer live in germany it's the worst so what are you up to programming the thimble guys so they will have a dive attack knockdown so thoughts on checking out the rework today and importing it later when retro is done i'm up for that i would stream a lot longer if you guys wouldn't mind like me just working out midstream or like taking a shit midstream for me that's always the limiting factor like at some point during the stream i just have to continue my workout and whatever and that's usually why i quit do it lol 120 minutes of ads while you shit dude i want mcbang do I disagree. I got underneath the knockdown animation. I would only see one rework. Wait, you're done with the entire thing? Oh, no, I can't just import it in yet because I'm gonna have to fix a bunch of texture formats. It's not gonna work. So look at it today and import it later. Oh. Oh, I thought you meant like do it like a longer stream today to do both at once. You can just turn off auto-pick anything else. I have no idea what that means. That's a complete nonsense statement in my book. Ah, okay. Yeah, I can absolutely take a look at it. Auto-pick texture format. Hey, are you talking about that? I have to fix formats. Yeah, I have to fix formats from Biobak's file. Because he doesn't always know what the correct formats are. Sometimes he has two i8s that are 64x64 or something like that. And then I need to fix it. Because he can't export this thing. So he can't check it. The N64 can handle as many polygons as you throw in it. It might just not be at a good frame rate. And all exports. Oh, okay. I can give it a try then. So I'm gonna gain four fps at least. All right. Are you 100% sure? If you change material orders, you might have messed up some overdrawing. So this is a... Holy shit! That would be crazy. I will definitely look at it in-game then. We can also look at the N64. See how it felt. Yeah. Check this out. And re-change lock. All right. Let me just finish this and then we are gonna do this. The  But honestly, it's a Course 14 enemy, I think it's fine to have it be a bit strong. It won't be fun if you're a motorcycle, come on, it's good as it is. As soon as Shai gets so fat, he's a thimble. Alright, I'm just gonna program the ability to instantly run after Mario onto him and then I think we're good. Wait, this should do it. Wait, what? Okay, so he turns, but then he instantly stops running. We'll try this. Can you summon them back when they slide to pop them up and give them a coin? Nope. Hydrate? Sure. Yeah, go hit some water. Yep, that's what I will do. Oh my God. The guy is like instantly going, nope. So you kind of have to backstab them. That's a really fun way to fight them. We see to the left and will there be mini games in new game plus where you're playing as Reiji? I don't know. All right, let's check out Biobak's rework. I have 73 files named changelog in my thing here. Oh my God. There we go. Changelog. Let's close this for now. Let's close this for now. Take a look at Biobak's thing. Yep, that will give them a little bit more knockback. Course 2 newest? Why do you call it Course 2 newest? All right, all material export without error, but look at the whole model before inputting as usual. Items and curve objects are hidden in blender for viewing convenience. You can unhide them when you're done checking out the level, all right? Blender renamed it? That's funny. Quick facts, 220 fewer tries, 7 fewer materials, that is insane. It's going to be like 30 levels in total, but 15 main courses and we're on the 14th. Are you seeing stuff? The mushroom here is a little bit different, I think. The bunny on here is better. I like that. Oh, we have proper walls here. Okay. The grass looks a lot more detailed. Oh, this is a cool texture. Okay, I like that. Oh, that's a sick windmill. That is a much better windmill than what we had before. Not sure if I like the fact you can walk behind it. All right, are they detectors and lighting? That's what I'm looking at right now. All new backgrounds. Oh, oh my God, yes. That is cool looking. Oh, look at that. Oh, that's sick. That does look pretty sick. Hello, Karim. More saturated sky, I like it. Is the sun still going? Oh yeah, the sun is over there. Nice. I removed the trees because they cost 8 million overdraw and the illusion completely broke from above the windmill. Fair. Made the forest smaller and put it in one spot. Okay. When the king's troops take you away, they would fly towards the forest in the cutscene for continuity. Okay, we can do that. Added some cool backgrounds through bushes in the distance. One texture and zero overdraw. Yes, yes, they look very cool. Disgusted sky should render behind everything else. The cloud sun should look infinitely far away. Easily done. Speaking of which, cooler sun texture. Yep, that's very cool. The sun elevation should rotate according to the camera movement. No movement equals no rotation. Doable, but I'm not sure how that should look. But we can do something, yeah? Add some room around the treehouse in the middle part of the slope to star 1. The middle part of the slope to star 1. The slope to star 1? What is the slope to star 1? Oh, this part here? The treehouse in the middle part. This? The star is here. But I'm guessing you mean here? Change the shape and look of the hole in the middle of the map. Yeah, this looks a lot more interesting. For sure. Add texture patches with mud and stuff. Oh, that's cool. That's very cool. Trunks replaced with mushrooms. Alright, I kinda like that. There's no trunks on this side here, which... Yeah, I think that's fine. No trunks on the other side because they were a bit unnecessary. Change the wooden wall to a brick wall. Yeah, this one here. It's an interesting look for sure. Start the little house in the middle of the slope towards the big treehouse. I guess this is the big treehouse. In the middle of the slope. This is a slope? This slope? This slope here? Is there another 6 areas? Probably. Walk again and now lead to a new path with Yoshiko and Egg at the end for placeness and liminality. I like it. Change the look of the map so it looks less like a penis. Fair. Add a new ability to run around it and a bed of flowers. Yeah, this one I'm not sold on. Because this feels extremely unnecessary. But at the same time it's kinda cool. I also really like the new flowers here. Tough choice for me. What are we gonna put behind the window other than the insect here? Probably non-Russell. Making money from shareholders. I have talked to a company that makes a thing to gather data for AI. They wanted to interview me for a potential job. And since I talked to them, I have just gotten 100% sure that all large language models are just garbage. Just paddling. It's not going anywhere. It's not gonna be ever useful. Other than a better Google. But we already have that one, so we don't need it 15 more times. Can you learn necessary placements from placements? Yeah, I guess I can kinda see it. Speaking of that, I had a revelation today by a mech. And I think you're gonna like this. I was thinking for the overworld. It is super important that the overworld is the entirety of Yoshi's Island. It is important that you get like a 360° round view of the beach next to Yoshi's Island. So it feels like you can actually explore the entire island. And like every little secret in there is like another nook or cranny of the island. I think that would be so cool. And then as you get more stars, you just go deeper into the island. Yeah. Alright. Slightly higher polar. Be able to get in front of it. It looks so much better. Shrooms now have an annulus at the base of the cap. Ooh, very nice. Slightly updated house designs. New windows that blend in better. Yeah. There's useful AI, but not LLMs. Yeah, okay. I was talking specifically about LLMs. I know AI is very useful, especially for like, you know, chess or like things that need raw computing power. Like chess. Updated flower design. Now the same color as the level border. DC, I'm guessing? Yes, very nice. Ooh, this looks cool. Change slide ends from the tree trunk to a flower bed. Yeah, that's a lot better. What's this? The new course 1 rework. Add mushrooms to the big tree trunk. I like it. Placed vines with nests because I couldn't make the vines look good. Nets, not nests. Yeah, they look pretty good. What I don't like about this texture here is that there's a light direction baked in. Unless you UV map the two to match that. You know what I mean? I think it would be fine. I think this one just might just need to be mirrored here. And this one too. And then it should be good. Remove the net to the top of the carrot house because I don't think there's anything up there. Top of the carrot house. Yep, there's nothing up there. Fair to remove that. Yeah, I'll just flip that over. Improved carrot house foliage. This here? Oh, I see. Slant change position rotation of the carrot house. Yeah, that's good. Improved mini tree trunks. Oh yeah, you added a shit ton of polys to them. But you also save polys in other places. Grass color has fewer random shifts than hue. It's now yellower where ever it is brighter. Okay. Open area between the windmill and the big trunk is now one connected piece of grass instead of steps. Okay. I'm guessing it's this part here. Alright. I do wanna just export this so we can take a look at this in-game. See the performance and take a screenshot. Okay. Yeah, I'm thinking the reaper settings are probably fine if it's loading mine. What the hell is going on? Oh, hey abila. Let's make it so we can learn stuff that you usually don't have in open 3D platformers like story driven courses and one in secret exit. Will this game have stuff like that? Yes. There are some story driven courses. Secret exits, inside courses, we don't have any of that. But there will be like a whole interconnected island thing going on. So hopefully that revokes the same feeling of like a secret exit. Please look at this level to see how Mario is running around would look. I don't want that because of my physics are not completely different from base Mario. I want to test on real N64 but fast 64 is doing this right now. Oh god, is this the Final Fantasy song? I hate this Final Fantasy song. I wasn't able to move around. I have to make room. B.O.B. text scroll is broken. I can't move. Secret start to grab the red coins and I like to press this with stuff like that be in the final game. Yes. So we're gonna have, I think, around 135 main stars. And then we're gonna have 45 Yoshi stars. These Yoshi stars are missions that Yoshi's give you that have like special restrictions or special roads like that. And there's gonna be four stars where it limits your A presses. There's nine other types of Yoshi stars that all have different restrictions. No, there's 11 types in total. So 10 more than that. Oh, the sun looks so good, though. Obviously, the collision is a little bit off centered, but that's fixable. There's a lot of things that look really nice here. Yeah. That bunny Goomba there is very funny. I'm guessing Biobak also reworked how that window looks. Okay, that definitely didn't export right, but it's fixable. So I'm not worried about it. Is there noise in those clouds? He added so much bend to that. Okay, where do I take a screenshot from? Maybe this is a good place for a screenshot. I'll be fine, it's just a short preview for Patreons. I just don't want the people on Patreon to, like, not know that I've been working on  Because I post so rarely about my stuff that people might just completely forget. Would you rather have only bacon but no games or games other than games but no games? I think I have to take the bacon. Alright, well, I will have to import all that later, the demo is going to look so hyped up. Alright, we gotta make the simple guys shine, move around. Would I have no games or no games? True. Oh, you definitely will see more stuff like that in Mushjam. Think of the green stars from our galaxy but less sucky. What about the rest of the level? Should we look at that right now? I feel like if I look at it right now and I find any mistakes I want to correct, I'm just going to have to keep that in mind and do it again later. Wouldn't it be better to do that as soon as that's done? Maybe on, like, Thursday or whenever I have time. Tuesday. Transition to red on those bridges. Yeah, I think it just makes logistically more sense to do it that way. I just want to show you that. Justsofast64 really understands I want this to be the first bone, and I bet it's not going to work. Justsofast64 really understands I want this to be the first bone, and I bet it's not going to work. Justsofast64 really understands I want this to be the first bone, and I bet it's not going to work. Good enough. Justsofast64 really understands I want this to be the first bone, and I bet it's not going to work.  Satellite, what's up? We just got part of the Course 1 rework. I posted about this on Patreon. And it looks awesome. And we were working on the thimble guys. And we were working on the thimble guys. Could this run on Gamecube? Well, I would hope Gamecube is strong enough to run this. Some would have to turn it into a Gamecube game first of all, but after that... I don't know. I don't know. Hmm, where do I get the camera angle? Hmm, where do I get the camera angle? In ref nodes. I don't think this ever explicitly gets the angle. I don't think this ever explicitly gets the angle. Actually, Fast64 is not the wokest blender plugin. This is something I learned yesterday. Using a premade engine is woke. And Fast64 does not use a premade engine. The thing about woke people is they can't program, which is why they have to use premade engines like Unreal Engine or Unity or Godot, right? So if you use your own engine, it's not woke anymore. I learned this yesterday on Twitter. I learned this yesterday on Twitter. You know, woke people use cnasm, which were made by someone.   It's true, woke people are known for bad programmers. Yeah. That's exactly what woke people are known for. Hello, soybeans. How do I map this though? Because I need both the pitch and the angle to matter. This is a difficult one. Alan Turing was famously straight too. Yeah, exactly. And programmer socks is when you wear big manly work boots. True. Wait, shh. I can just do this. This is better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing about people. We always look back 30 years and say this was not a good time. Times now are so much better. No. I mean, I might, but I have not planned it. Yeah. Yeah. Are you good? It's when someone asks you, how are you? Do you consider this someone inquiring you about information? Or do you consider this gesture of friendliness and invite to be part of the social group? I will never not look at it as an inquiry for information.  Really? Okay. So we have a thing here where one axis controls the X offset and the other controls the Z  offset. But that's not how this actually works. Camera wise. I know that is the latter, but it still feels like the former. Yeah. True. How do we transform this from pitch and jaw to X and Z? Do we just, just add those together? No, we can't. If jaw is controlling the one axis, then that doesn't work. Pitch has to control how far off the top it is. And jaw has to control the rotation of the thing. Right? I think that makes sense. Pitch controls offset from and jaw controls rotation around X. So... Z offset 1 equals... Pitch divided by 512 or something. Let's do 64 for now, just to see what's going... How this is going to go. This will require some amount of trial and error, most likely. And then the second one... Jaw controls... This is not offset. This is offset magnitude. It should be... Yes, it needs to be 32. And then... Offset rotation is just pitch. Okay, cool. This is going to be completely wrong, but I wanna just have a base and then we can just adjust it from there. The last game I bought... Oh, I actually bought Minecraft recently. I usually don't buy games, but I did buy Minecraft recently. Let's not do anything cool. Oh, wait. That's not layer 6. Yeah, true, Moritz. I'm not gonna mod Minecraft, I just wanna casually play it a little bit. Maybe I shouldn't be dividing like this. Let's see how this goes. Related to party, yeah. I'm in no rush to play video games, guys. I play them whenever I feel like it. I don't need to play them on release. I don't need to play them on release. I don't need to play them on release.  I don't need to be part of the cultural experience. I just wanna enjoy the game for what it is. Nice. 1, 2, 4. 1, 2, 4. That's how it works usually here. Well, I guess the R here is missing as well. I might have to debug print some stuff. Okay. If you're reading the online zoom bar, that is annoying. Yeah, I can see it for like Mario Kart Wii. It will not do the... I think you need to be on a different channel if you wanna see that stuff. 0 and 0? Okay. Okay. The game seems to... The grass... Is grass here? Shading? I guess the lighting is not fully baked yet. Why is the used pitch so small? What? The pitch should be a lot bigger than that. The hell? Oh. He killed the deathlox, I don't do deathlox anymore because people don't watch them. At this point I would expect the offset to go absolutely crazy, but it is not moving at all. He killed himself, funniest shit I've ever seen. I don't see which part of this would not work. It is a transparent decal. It is being rendered with no other set tile size and layer 0 in between. Yet it is not moving, curious. Why do you think that Lilaa, I'm just playing a game once casually, I want nothing more to do with the game. Can I just have my peace? Imagine though if instead of Mario 64 I had modded Sonic Adventure 1 or 2 when I was a  My whole life would be so different. I would be a millionaire. The joke is that one job offer, oh, why they wanted me to move to fucking Vancouver. Yeah, no shot. I don't see how this could possibly not work. What the hell? This should leak from here. Random EXE, that's Adobe AppData, I've seen this before, still scary every time. Hi, I'm Moritz. I live in Antarctica. I mean, Antarctica sounds kind of nice, but Vancouver, the rent there is so high you would just die. Actually, I don't know if that's true. Do you think I should do that? OK, so every shot has an implicit goal to it. So, what is the goal to your shot here? My suspicion is the goal in your shot and the implicit goal is if you want to make me happy, you should do this, not if you want to live a good life or if you want financial stability. Oh, that could work, Lila. And if the can't one doesn't work, you can still just be a roach and live in other people's houses and eat their leftovers. That only exists, Excellent Gamer, and it sucked because the camera broke. This can't not work. I refuse to believe this. How is this possible? Where else am I using this? Is she just passing in a random U16 works? What the hell? Maybe I didn't come up. I don't know what's going on, but there were random like spiral maps in there, which I didn't understand at all. I'm all for being creative with the hack, but if you just add random stuff like spiral levels in there, you're kind of branding it as a hack and not like, you know, a proper game. Not a consistent vision. I don't get it. This house is not doing anything. You eat more food, Lila, that's how. And lift some weights, too, so you don't just get fat, because if you're trying to do the shine on top of the head, I wanted to move. So for that, I'm going to use a set tile size and do a tile scroll here. But for some reason, no matter what I set these tiles to, it does nothing. We can even just sanity check this with literally random U16, now it should jump around like crazy. It would not be easy, I go now. The reason that game is 60 is because it doesn't have like a depth buffer that needs to do that basically cuts all the rendering time in half. If you have a rigid camera, you can do many things that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do. Yeah, even with the literal random position, it doesn't work, cool. GeoTempleGuy is being called, though. It doesn't change the routine, because I honestly feel like you've done everything, but you can probably write something more interesting. Well, yeah, I'm making my own games. Yeah, I will do what makes me happy. Now I getcha. Wouldn't that be funny? Could be that the emulator I'm using is inaccurate. An emulator has no shine at all. Postings are expensive to access, yep, that's why I removed that. Look, if I press CTRL-Z, it appears. Ugh, I don't like hiding something actually important in some bullshit like that, Biobak. Or you mean I do both, as in, and for the Final Fantasy IV game, I do this, but I've already released a demo. Oh, yeah, that could work. Yep, that works. Setting the wrong tile? Yes. You can see this one is tile 1, and this one is tile 0, which is the other one. We can see what happens with tile 1, though. Also nothing. This is so weird. And then there's also the question of why does it not work in NEMU, or why does it just disappear in NEMU? Maybe it disappears in NEMU because it's not a valid offset. That would be fair enough, honestly. Yeah, there's four different poems, I think. Only the wing cap returns, that's the only good one. RT64 debugger would be pretty nice. Save me, Dariel. True. Alright, we'll make the offset a bit smaller, see if it's better then. Wait, Echoes of Wisdom stole my power-up? No way, Nintendo would never do that. Stealing from me? Hello, Layra. I have the thimble guys imported, we're working on their shine right now. They look like this. We also need a peach noodle, if you wanna do that. Cute. I like him a lot. The problem is, it doesn't work. And I don't see why at all. This all runs as it should. Lilaa, true. Pila. Some people call her Pila, can you believe it? You know what I forgot? I forgot to check the performance of the new Course 1 on N64. I have a suspicion, it's gonna run worse. Yeah, it runs a decent bit worse, but I think we can improve it still. Let's see. Wait. Anti-aliasing indeed never turns stuff on again. This might not actually be worse. Okay, nevermind, it's the same performance. Cool, cool, cool. Considering it is the same performance, and there's a lot of performance improvements we can still make to this level because of some sorting things, and that thing up here. I think this is overall gonna be better. Don't get a sub there, it's the right spot, alright. Of course, I still gotta do the collision too. Man, that looks so clean here. Random mode momentum, true. Is there a chance that it just completely ignores the set tile size here for some reason? Can it do that? I don't think it can. The shine moving should look like this. Alright, that sounds promising. Maybe now it works. It shouldn't be a difference, but I had to spoil this bit. I hate girlfriends. I am gonna lose it. I would be fine if the texture just moved a random place. But it doesn't. What if I just manually enter a random number here? What happens now? Wait, it sets lights? All of these set lights? What? What? I'm not real, Lilaa wake up! You've been in a coma, we've been trying to reach you. This is a new method we're trying. That does make it disappear. So it looks like for some reason, the thing just doesn't go through. Why is there such a weird alpha data being set? I don't think I ever did anything to change that. It's so weird. For some reason, it always goes back to zero. I can't set it to anything here, but it goes back to zero. What if I move to GeoASM here? We're definitely on layer transparent decal too. I am so confused. What? Stop doing anything. What is it supposed to do? Move the shine around. And it's weird, because if I do this, I can move the shine here. But it only works if I directly edit this. That must mean that somewhere in this chain, it is just getting rid of it. What if I turn material? Material bleeding on. What if turning on material bleeding thinks that I'll be so pissed? I'm returning GFX, the pointer to the start of the GFX. Still doesn't work. See? I see literally no way how this could possibly not work. This would be the same code. But we can get rid of the alt storage, shouldn't make a difference compilation-wise. Am I writing the draw layout to the wrong thing? Nope, they all do it like this. What if the macros don't work with the plus plus, what if they like decrease or increase the pointer differently because they reused the thing twice? Possible but unlikely. What worries me more is that it didn't work on Nemu. Why would this possibly just work on Project 64 and not Nemu? Or well, it doesn't even work on Project 64. But why would it just not display at all on Nemu? There has to be some really weird render bug here. Are you seeing that? It's not even there. How does it look on N64? What if this is a crazy emulator bug? In this place but it doesn't move. Okay, so the render is a little bugged on Nemu.  But all the other times I've done this, it just worked. This looks so cool. It doesn't work the way I want. Well, it doesn't work at all. If the shine was moving at all, I would be happy already. I'm on the show and it's completely gone. Yeah, I have the summer card. It's a lot better than all the other flashcards. Show code. Here's the code. It definitely is correct. Or well, it can't be correct, but it should be. If you look at all the other things where I did this, it's the same. How can this be? Yeah, this is an issue here. Jeff, what are you doing? I'm trying to fix or to make a light reflection of the head of the Thimble guys. But it's not working for some reason. Oh my God, dude. Every time I post a Styrofoam, people are saying it's not a normal map. It's something else or a specular map. Or a bump map. Some people say it's a bump map instead of a normal map, but they're the same thing. And I start as a normal map. So it's definitely not a bump map. No one could tell me what the effect is called yet. Everyone has a different opinion on it. If there's anything with DrawLayer, it's a lot faster. DrawLayer is not on the flags, and the flags are U8 on my end. Yeah, but it's definitely not a bump map or a specular map. It's definitely not a specular map. Because the specular map has the same value across the whole thing. But that's commonly what people tell me it is. But I know that that is the one thing it's for sure not. This is a stupid bug, I think. Yeah. Well, we could pull out the debugger. See if there's anything special we see. You can't edit it in the EDL, because there's more than one person in the map. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Is this where I want to be? I think it is. E854. Oh, no, it's definitely not where I want to be. Shit, I went too far. B000. That's not what we want. This was like 8028 or something. There we go. And return 0? How can this return 0? Huh? What? What? This looks fine, right? No, I don't even have a handler for being out of GFX memory. I can't be out of GFX memory. Also, I might crash on my boss. So. Is there aliasing going on here somewhere? No. Well, think about it. Why would I handle being out of GFX memory if I just want to have enough GFX memory to not run out anyway? Right? That makes sense to me. A1 is right here. So this should store 0 here. And the V0, V0, FFF. I guess that's part of the macro. F2. Stores a 0. Bored with V1. Okay. That's the offset. That's the other offset. That's the end display list comment. What are we loading here? 803151B8. Is that the current object? Probably. You can emphasize that stuff.  I don't know, Lena. It might just be my accent. Why is there an SQRT.S here? Who do you belong to? Don't really see it. Oh, well. At your S0, V0. I don't know why we would do that. Diff. Instead of an SRL, we do a diff.  Makes some sense. This is the text. It's another text. Don't know what that is. Don't care. Do a multiplication. What? What? What do you need all this math for? What did the compiler do here? I am in the bizarro world right now. So V0 is 0. I see the back. Do you see the back? Say it again. You see this? That was the back. I bet I have to somewhere else. That's so dumb. And this is why you don't trust your fucking compiler. You look at the assembly and then you find it out. Fuck you, GCC. Why didn't you warn me? Why was there no warning? Like, oh, you're just shadowing the variable. It's not gonna work, bro. You little asshole. Fuck. I'm sure it will do something now. The compiler can't warn you of stuff like that. It definitely can. Most compilers wouldn't even allow you to do this. It is a chunky Shy Guy, melon. He's made of a thimble. Oh, I didn't know he fell. Let's try if ChetGPD would have caught that. Alright, let's do it. I will ask ChetGPD. My code doesn't work. Why wouldn't this be fetchable? Oh no, ChetGPD caught that. Recurring the GFX within the if statement. We could have just asked ChetGPD. It would have told us. W is shadow. That's a thing. Has been added to the flags. Alright, it seems real. I have added it to flags. If it's real, it will work. If not, then who cares. Verifying it works is a waste of time. Because it does not change the course of my actions. It does something, but it only works under certain conditions right now. It looks like it only works if both are positive. Ah, shit. You have to type float in this fucking garbage. Float. Why not F32? It's a 32-bit floating point type. I'm gonna buy. Let me just, oh my god, it's calling an equal SF function here, what is this shit? Okay, I can't illustrate my point, but what GCC will sometimes do is, if you have something like this, it will slot the divide instruction into the delay slot of the branch, so it will always divide by zero that way, and crashes. Let's get some code, what, there's some code missing, it was just compiling garbage, shit. How big can this be? 12 bits, okay. Well, you can fix that by just rearranging some code, usually, so far I haven't lost the cycle to that bug yet, it's only ever causing some annoyances. And, it's offsetting it too much. I think this is actually an offset in texels, so maybe, let's sell some 128s better. The TTYD remake flopped, really? How do I make a death spread out of this, and send it back to Galena? Hmm, it looks like it's only ever scrolling in one direction, can I not scroll the other direction? Fingerboard guy, yeah. So, who's best starting Switch game in May 2024? Well, I'm the best Super Smash Bros. Melee player, named Kaze Emmanuel, in Nova Scotia, so, I mean, that's what it sounds like. In May, sure. Reference back to Vietnam, well, thank you. Oh, it's because I have Clamp set. So it doesn't work with Clamp, that's good to know, and also extremely limiting. We might have to make the textures smaller. Oh god! That's a lot of W-Shadow warnings. Let's go through those real quick. 793. Where do you need this? I knew it, cool. Shadow is a global declaration? Oh god. What is this shadow? Shadow is a previous local. How can this both shadow a previous local and also be not valid anymore if I remove it? Okay, it's just the shadowing something now, but I don't care about that right now. Do you want to turn variable shadowing into an error at some point in the GC? No, I don't need to. Why would I ever want something in error instead of a warning? I used to have to do that, perhaps, because the old compiler demanded it, but with GCC I don't need to. That's kind of sick looking. Yeah, it is an old system I think. I think I like this now. The ideal moment is the roof. Alright, so there's another enemy I want to program and that is the next one here. I'm not entirely sold on how he looks yet. But this was the idea. He is like a painted egg and he's like this enemy from Yoshi's Island. What do you think? But that is it for today. No, I didn't say that. I was thinking of streaming longer, but that means I have to go about my normal day while I'm streaming. So you guys will have to deal with me running to the bathroom, drinking protein shake and doing my workout. I like him too. I just think he looks a little cheap. My slog of eating workout during compilation. In that case, I'm going to take like half a minute break or so to set up my weight lifting and drinking some protein shake and taking a piss. Can you guys still hear me fine? Do I need to shout? I'm doing triceps extension today. I'm going to warm up at 75. This feels like I'm a real influencer. You know what influencers do? They just kind of scream themselves as doing the most mundane shit ever. And I don't know why people watch it. But this is what it feels like. And I don't know how they do it without feeling really weird about it. Warm ups are important. Don't break my elbow. Hopefully we can't hear you piss. We can hear you. Good. Good. We hear you. I'm microphone is making your voice weird, but I can understand that. Full screen, please. I actually do have a full screen scene, but if I do, my OBS is going to crash. I'm going to get some shake and take a piss. And you guys tell me what you think of my egg guy. In the meantime, I will be back. I'm going to be back. I'm going to be back. Hello. Hello. Next one up, 100 pounds. I'm going to be back. I'm going to be back. Next one up, 100 pounds. Alright, I'm ready for the real deal. We can't see you. Oh. Just another video capture. If I touch OBS, it might crash. Cute. Good. Comparisons, I like that. The E-word. His eyes or nose could have highlights. Yeah, I can see that. I like him, but he doesn't look very handcrafted. Yeah, I like him to look like a painted egg. But the sharp cutout here is kind of ruining that. It is kashish. Update OBS. I've already tried that. It doesn't work. Hmm. Hello. Headshot. Switch to Linux. Nope. I literally would lose my job if I did. Who the fuck paints eggs for dioramas? Do you have a better idea on how he should be crafted?  I kind of agree, yeah. UE5 is not on Linux. Or maybe it is, but nope, that's not how I work. Also, yeah, Visual Studio. Who cares? Literally, who cares? I don't want to talk about that. Yeah, so we probably need a different way to craft this guy. If he doesn't look very crafted. Or maybe if I smudge the edges here a little bit, maybe that would be better. He could be a little balloon. Like a painted balloon? Should be a separate object. How does separating this into an object make any difference at all? He looks the exact same. The cardboard feed, yeah, they help a little bit sell the illusion, but everything else, not really. Button eyes. Buttons on an egg? Paper mache balloon? No.  Yeah, this kind of shape would work for him. I don't get what he's supposed to be. He's supposed to be a painted egg. Okay. No, he will just be jumping at you. That's the perfect thing about these enemies. We can make them jump just with the cardboard feed, so the animation's gonna look good. And that's all they need to do to move around, because that's what they do in Yoshi's Island. Might need to do more brainstorming on this guy. The thing about paper mache is that we need some sharp angles in the texture. Might be difficult to sell, especially if you want, like, semi-realistic lighting. This guy would be like a Goomba, because with just jumping he's not gonna be very threatening. The way I'm thinking this guy would work is... Let me show you the areas. And there would be the paper mache on the egg tray cardboard material and the rest can remain egg. Oh, the egg tray cardboard could work. Come on, load the level, please. Please. Oh no. So I was thinking where the big enemy markers are here, we're gonna put him here. And if you come into his area, he's gonna aggressively jump at you. And when he touches you, he doesn't deal damage. He bounces you back. You know, like a balloon or a trampoline. That's how they work in Yoshi's Island, too. And because there's so much depth floor here, that makes them really, really dangerous. So even with just jumping, I think they're gonna be dangerous enough. They're also gonna be big. The blender sometimes is not very fast. It is what it is. Alright, let me do my first real set while we brainstorm more. Oh god, I'm looking at the noise so much, you're just gonna hear me moan. Alright, let's do this. Oh, that felt pretty easy. Hello Zelda. You pick a background and then you animate it. You want an enemy like this? Like a Scuttlebuck like that? I don't know about that. I want a Yoshi's Island enemy, to be honest. Pom Pom Nose? Yeah, yeah. Definitely. If we're going with this design, yes, Pom Pom Nose for sure, but I'm not sold on the design yet. Maybe the pants could be painted like a Yoshi egg? But, we want him to look like he's painted like the enemy. Oh, he's in Yoshi's Island too? He's not very prevalent. The fancy lighting the runes temple got? That requires a lot of vertices, so most likely no. But maybe? I don't know. It would look very good on this level, specifically. Yeah, this is how I want it. We're on the N64, we can't make shaders. If you thought that was nuts, look at this one here. Thoughts on him? He's from a Yoshi game? He's funny, but Yoshi's Island, man. Bert the Bashful is just so perfectly Yoshi's Island. Maybe our brightness is turned up a lot, Tiberius? The N64 has a fixed pipeline, so the amount of things you can do in the shader are super limited. They're limited to simple addition, multiplication, not even division or anything like that. And you only get two math operations, basically. And they have to be with specific numbers. We can look for other Yoshi's Island enemies. Most iconic Yoshi's Island enemies. What does the internet think? Bert the Bashful is literally the first one. Nappy Nuts Sockpuppet? I think he's not a good enemy here, because how are you going to get past him other than waiting, and that would be boring. We also already used Nappy Nuts a lot, so I think Bert the Bashful would be a good one here. I think it's going to be Bert. We just need him to look more like an egg, I think. I think it's going to be Bert. It looks a lot better, I think. And it's a lot more handcrafted now, to me. A collision map will be made, of course. We always make a collision map. But not before the level is done. That would be a waste of everyone's time. So, the nose should be fuzzy, and the egg should look more like an egg. You see how the shadow is on the egg? Does someone just have an image of a rolling egg? This is pretty cool, yeah? A spiked fun guy. Look how pronounced the reflection on the egg is. That's awesome, Miolu. That's awesome. That's awesome. Do you think this helps? The little shine on here? To make him look more reflective? Not everything needs to be dynamic. I see your point, yes. But this is easier for me. And it's basically free anyway. And then we want this to be a pom-pom. Pom-pom. How do I make a pom-pom? I didn't add specular, it's an environment map decal. It generates UV coordinates from the camera rotation. It's not a real specular or anything like that. Oh my god, dude. How many viewers do we have right now? I see so many people in chat. I can't actually see my viewers because I'm double streaming. 53 on Twitch. That's not bad. I didn't know I had so few viewers, I'll be honest. I thought I averaged like 70 on Twitch. 51 on YouTube? Okay, that's a lot more than I thought I had. So it all balances out. You averaged 20 to 30 on Twitch? What?! Oh, this is not any specific method. I'm just making up bullshit and seeing if it works. I mean, overdraw wouldn't be a big issue because this is so low poly. But maybe the shelf assist is the right way to do it. He doesn't want the hat. He's bald and proud. What game will this be? Return to Yoshi's Island 64. This shape is very difficult to view map. Can you make a rom to just this on? I'm not making a whole rom for you. I'm more person computer screenshot true. I'm not making a whole rom for you. This should look fuzzy in game. I hope. Any plans for the retro wilderness course? Yes, it's going to be Mario painting. The next screenshot is so good. It's a blender back. It doesn't look bad if it was a crumpled paper ball. It's a pump on now. Bird. Yeah. Is Leland shot? I'm not clicking on the armature before. I'm just hitting export. Fuck. I'm a little sad that I can't see the twitch emotes. I'm a little sad that I can't see the twitch emotes. This is some tense with the Mario music. Holy shit. The phone can attack with Mario, right? Correct. And attacks again, so it needs to be level. Mixing those two up. You mean I really like the music? I haven't commented on the music once. Why am I being accused of things? You still live. I still live. Were you hoping I was dying by now? I don't know. If you want to kill me, you have to take out a life insurance policy on me first. Please at least make bank off of it. Put Reina through college. That's not what I said. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.   I get to live for a little longer. So things did you miss I broke up the entire thimble guys and we tested The first one reworked by a black mate looks like it's gonna run near perfect 60. Look at this This is the thimble guy He takes you like that And you can kick him And now we're working on birth the bashful I Can't the render order is the wrong order Folks even reveal on Tuesday. Hopefully. Yeah, if I can stream on Tuesday, I Should be able to I don't think anything can stop me He fed through Okay, so how do I invert the render order Mm-hmm. What if I do this and then yes Doesn't look like it worked But if I do this And then this Doesn't look like it worked cool. One of the two will work. I just have to trial and error I guess Okay, I need to do this the other way around That better work Are you going to call the second one?  Return to Yoshi's Islands Your mom make chocolate mousse cake. Let's go. We have the good chocolate cake. You guys wouldn't believe this but in Canada Whenever you make cake, it's really breading It's not a cake at all. It sucks But the chocolate mousse cake is pretty good Yes, I live in Canada Germany is a hellhole and I'm very glad to not live there anymore The Friends and nothing will ever be able to compare Do you have the nice $5 Walmart cake mousse au chocolat? Actually, that is French. Wait, maybe that's why the cake is good Dude it's like it doesn't matter what actually no now it looks to be in the right order, but it doesn't look fuzzy at all I Want part of Germany I used to live in a street slant leader Saxon I Looks reasonable fuzzy to me And also not a color you could make it less saturated I Should match the color from below here Coming from mousse cake what time what time do you need me to leave? You're also from a space on what? Which city maybe art from the same city. That would be crazy We do another set real quick. It looks like I'm gonna go out tonight. So I better finish my workouts I Still feels pretty good. Oh, I've been I've been there before I'm from Norton It's pretty close 730 no, I can go on at 730. It's good Shell based fast. I don't know what that means I think this is pretty good The size of him seems good to not a late stream just a long stream Okay To Nintendo background music I got you That's some chill music All right, let's program this guy I Frankly there is nothing In a song be louder hard on Zelda's wish we will play the song and make it louder I Taught it will stream Turning Slip it in and I'll be tripping As I take more cock horse cock shut the door and turn the lock is your cock the horse cock I made the song peppa coyote I don't use Spotify and I never will Why would anyone ever use Spotify over YouTube for music? Spotify has less songs more ads And it's a shitty UI Hmm You   Now check out the video and it's made for music this YouTube music All right, um, I think I've had enough of that song Saltsy can win up not familiar with that combo So we need to make his calling books Looks to be around three to seven in size His shadow One six nine, maybe Actually, I think I have to multiply this by two and keep getting this one wrong But I'm not listening to individual songs, I only pick up put up for the OSTs Wait There's a Dragon Ball CD, but we're gonna get so banned off twitch for listening to that Hello happy art club, that's good. Okay, let's get to the next one You  The jump should probably be reactable so we should probably have a long jump animation here You You Yeah, kind of like that but this needs to snap further back And why no music that damn it What can I do at this point I Guess we're listening to your me now I So we're gonna have him jump like this me like this in air and then In the end, we're gonna reset everything Once he lands and that's his only animation I Never I Just can't That's what we do It's only horse club music I Like this song but I have problems with the singer Is it like a problematic singer or something? Or you just Okay but nevermind Bang a song recommendation came up just now This is what we do This is one of the best songs of all time I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I        I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I  I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I   I I  I I I I I I I I I I I   I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I  I I I I I I I I I I I I I I          I I I I I I I I I I I            I Okay, so when we do this, he needs to... which areas does he even need to work on? That tells us a lot about what we need to program. Needs to work here... Okay... He needs to work here... Shit! I say we keep the forward velocity consistent and only modulate his Y speed. Or maybe we keep the Y consistent and modulate his forward. I think that would be the best. This is what I want. This is just doing some integration. And then we find everything. I think we read some best tracks and we are conceived as a species. It is a very nice song. Does that even make sense? 60? Think about it. 15 frames. 15 multiplied by 14. 1 of 5 multiplied by 4. Wait, what? That doesn't make sense. There's no way it's only 400 coordinates. Right? Am I stupid? If you jump with 60 velocity with 4 gravity, there's no way you only jump 420 coordinates. Wonderwall? Art is a lot about what it makes you feel. And for me, when I hear Wonderwall, it makes me feel aggression. Because there's people playing guitar at parties singing Wonderwall to a group of girls sometimes. And I've had that experience. I've seen that before. And the amount of disgust I feel from this whole situation is so high that by proxy I hate Wonderwall. Do the girls like it? I hope not. I hope not. This is 30 multiplied by 14. 420 multiplied by 2. Okay, 840. That's better. Just interesting. It's probably a simple song, right? That's why the party guys play this? Huh. What's so bad about Wonderwall? Guys playing it on guitar. That's so bad about it. That's so bad about it. Need to make this an F32 to prevent a stupid conversion. It's just because it's an easy song to play? Yeah, I figured. You know what? This is something I keep saying. And people are saying this is a bad thing. But I keep saying, learning to play an instrument is just a party trick. And this is just another proof of that. People are saying it's a bad take. I think it's a great take. I think it's a great take. I forgot to give him high velocity. I think. Okay. Ready your room at the Hotel California Anytime of year Anytime of year You can find it here I think we're done. That should do it. Then come to parties without the guitar. And then think it's so serious that they know they don't need to show off. Okay. I don't think that's got anything to do with guitar skill, but rather just with who you are as a person. Looks pretty poopy right now. They living it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise What a nice surprise With your alibis To me playing an instrument and being a musician like a composer are two completely separate things. If you're a composer you probably learn to play an instrument for the sake of making music. But if you just wanna play music you're not gonna learn to compose. Running for the door I had to find the passage back to the place I was before Relaxed said the night man We are programmed to receive You can check out anytime you like But you can never leave And I think thank you Arthur Who posted the egg? Plants on my scale I'm probably gonna give it the You know You You You He sometimes still jumps the animation frames which I don't like Maybe I should just reduce this to 50 Yes The OST for this is completely 100% original Which by the way I haven't shown you guys the song that Badub made for this level yet That I want everyone's input on This is the song that Badub made for this level  A-Z-O-U-M  A-Z-O-U-M A-Z-O-U-M   A-Z-O-U-M     A-Z-O-U-M A-Z-O-U-M A-Z-O-U-M A-Z-O-U-M You love it? It's beautiful I'm glad you guys like it But for me It doesn't fit the vibe Feels more like A beach at sunset Not like a complete adventure, you know And I'm also kinda missing the The melody that you can hum along to What's this for? This level here A-Z-O-U-M We hear Super Mario Bros. in it We hear Mario Sunshine in it But you know what else I hear in this? Doki Doki Literature Club The end sounds like your reality to me This part I really like Why would I use a shroom though? Yeah A-Z-O-U-M The Sunshine Epid sounds great But I'm glad you guys have done nothing more recent than 6488 Yeah, that's awesome, so Yeah I hadn't even thought about that But I'm the Zero Mode He's happy and alive Having a good time So you can love music for sure though That would work I was actually thinking of just releasing R.T.Y.I. Together with an OST cartridge You have content of R.T.Y. Yeah, I have  Yeah, I have I have content of R.T.Y. I have content of R.T.Y. Yeah, kinda Actually, now that I think about it I think you shouldn't have the bounciness here I think the bounciness is what ruins Burt No, I think it would just be really cool To release a separate cartridge That isn't just the OST Because then we could sell it too As merch And it could have all the bonus songs in it Because we'd have more space in the room Yeah, I agree Dead Blacks The OST would probably just be released publicly as well Or something like that But releasing it on a cartridge That would be the coolest thing ever But I think we have done enough for today Especially since I have to go out later and eat cake I'm gonna finish my workout and take a shower Copyrighted though I don't know how that works But I will probably talk to a lawyer Before I release R.T.Y.I. So, yes Until next stream Bye
