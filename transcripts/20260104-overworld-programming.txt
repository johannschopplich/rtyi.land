Terrible start to the stream. What were we missing for the mission? The cutscene at the start. And I think that's all. Hello Selton. And I guess I'm balancing. The balancing of the mission was kind of rough still. Hello Rainer Hase. Hello Barry Langs and Rats. How are you rats doing? I'm so close to being done with all my refactors. Oh my god guys. I'm gonna feel so free once this is done. I only have one more file to go. Just one file. Just one file. And honestly I don't even know what I'm supposed to do with my time after that. There's some ghost 13 stuff I have to finish. And then after that it's just RTYI. It's just RTYI. That's all after that. It's making content again. Just the overworld and the side levels. This was such a long project to do on the side. It's kind of crazy. It's just the overworld and the side levels. This was such a long project to do on the side. It's kind of crazy. It's just the overworld and the side levels. This was such a long project to do on the side. It's kind of crazy. You know. You know. You know. You know. Factoring hype. Yup. Factoring hyip.  This year is release finally. The release is when it is. There is a good chance I want to remove all copyrighted content before release. There is a good chance I want to remove all copyrighted content before release. There is a good chance I want to remove all copyrighted content before release. There is a good chance I want to remove all copyrighted content before release. There is a good chance I want to remove all copyrighted content before release. There is a good chance I want to remove all copyrighted content before release. Fine. Fine. Fine. Do i start? Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Okay. Okay. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Okay. Okay. Alright let's see how this goes. Did I upload a clip today? Did everyone see it? The clip today? How was it? Did you guys like it? Going alright. Alright. Alright. It was super easy. Now, why did the cringe? Everyone the focused actor should that may be the melon Predefinition of melon I hate that such cases work like this and it's truly atrocious Hmm I don't see a reason this would crash That's bizarre Let's try that again On Mario 64 with untitled green dinosaur everywhere The wall would hopefully be a little bit more well done than that Ideally after removing the Mario IP, we wouldn't even be able to tell that this was a Mario game at one point Okay, what is going on here? I'm looking at 8021EV which is play cutscene Play cutscene Should be functional Oh I know the issue I need to pass this It's only building the changes Currently suffering a shitty birthday Let's go I also hate people Oh no Yoshi, let me go I need to help your friends I don't quite like that though Oh What if we focus on the Shy Guy spawner and made this no longer And then the scene was also rotated 30 degrees Is this the real life? Is this a fantasy? Okay It's kinda getting there Oh If it's this one then we definitely need to have the camera below Something like this I also think this song is going to make this mission a lot more sensible Okay Okay Looking at me F0ST F0ST Fine You know what? It's been G0ST Okay Okay one thing I'm a bit worried about with this mission is that like just doesn't look good I think we need to make a cutscene proper with my cutscene engine Something that focuses on this and then over here And then the beginning is smooth Hmm You know what we can do? We can make it so that it focuses on the Shy Guy once there is any Okay Well programming like this isn't really that difficult I only do simple programming Let's see how this works out now Oh Hmm Bye Matt Sorry I had to respond to someone who wants to make a save state code for F0 So I give him a bit of guidance This is a long-ass cutscene I know why Okay We need this block here And then Okay We need the default pitch This will be the default list And then once this happens we go the other way around And we can look a bit closer And now we should have something I also want to make sure that the Shy Guys only spawn on one side during the cutscene I think that would be better spawn on one side of the scene Um cutscene There we go Alright That should do it Music is this The Extreme Geo is here Are you gonna RTY Mario for a bit? As in inputting him? Are you gonna actually add the Jigga physics back to it too? For PC port? Will this end? Why no end? I mean what else is to work there? What else is there to work on if not the Nose physics? Hello Quilts Man I have two videos almost ready One is finally about the GTA Mario one And the other one is about the Nose physics Finally about the GTA Mario one And the other one is about some combiner math tricks basically It's gonna be called by N64 artists needed to be mathematicians or something like that Let's try it like this What if I just looked like Steve Buschini under the mask? I don't know man What then? You tell me Isn't there one game where you can see a shy guy under the mask? What the hell is this? Isn't there one game where you can see a shy guy under the mask? What the hell is this? Stop the cutscene Why is this gonna be happening? I'm so confused I'm so confused Hmm Remember Frobo? Of course I remember Frobo What about him? Recolourability is your main goal? It's already fully recolourable You just have to change the print colour What's the name of this music? Extreme G Music Track 4 Okay, it prints nothing What the hell? Is it because it instantly stops focusing the melon? This must be it Yeah, I see I see What? I'm the worst streamer on the whole wide planet. I said they come from both sides when they can't even boost on one side. I agree. Don't worry about it. Ah, you made it worse. You made me worry about it, I'm googling this. What did Bioback type into my chat? Nothing at all. Okay, great. It actually doesn't show up. Yeah, I would love to do that. I hope PixelPolaro can make that animation for us. I'm a terrible animator, I think it's best I do not touch animations. Yeah, I agree. I should do it. God, I wish I had more time. I still want to make that home brew thermometer, but I couldn't find the time to do it yet. It would be the coolest thing ever. And especially now in February, it's like a perfect time to do it. Because I could just put my N64 outside instead of buying a freezer box or something. Alright, let's see our part 9 to-do list. The Yoshi's, we don't have to do that yet. Fruit Juice Bar, that's for Zana. Talk to the Yoshi to start the Patsy, the Shaggyplant and the Melon. When you touch the Melon, they start damaging it. We're slowly running out of time. Actually, we don't have that, but that's fine. Someone takes too much damage and explodes, and Mara fades out and is spawned next to the Garden of Yoshi. Can you have a fridge at home? Yes, but the fridge is not cold enough for what I want to do. Well, this is a racing game, so... Okay, we did everything on part 9 that we can do right now. Part 7's entrance, which you can jump down to. Part 7 doesn't exist anymore. Part 10's entrance... Oh, we haven't done that yet. We need to make the Super Happy Tree seedlings. Becoming my to-do list style with the Minus and Plus. I like that style, it's so quick and easy. Okay, gang, we have a little bit of a design problem to solve right now. Let me present it to you. So there are Super Happy Tree seedlings that grow in the overworld, and they grow after you beat the second Bowser level. And there's one here, and one in the part we were just in. The question is, how do we make them look in a way that, one, you realize they will grow later? Ideally. And two, it makes sense that you can use them to get up here. Now, the easiest would be just a Super Happy Tree-shaped little tree that grows upwards and has a bunch of leaves that you can jump on, I think. I actually kind of like that idea already. But jumping from leaf to leaf sounds like it fucking sucks. We're just going to be barefooters of the game then? Maybe? I don't really have any big plans for it right now. But there's going to be more Yoshis that you free after beating the second Bowser level, so maybe they can be around here? This is also where the final boss fight happens, so we do need a little bit of space here. And there's going to be a little bit of a Yoshi Village part here too. What did you miss? Not much. Just the entire childhood. And you're about to miss your adulthood too. Life is a blip. Close your eyes and the next day, you're in your deathbed. Wait, where's my coin? This was supposed to give me a coin. Okay, that's bugged. Let me write that down here. Woohoo! What can we do if not jumping from leaf to leaf? Look at the super happy tree. Not super happy tree friends, just a super happy tree. How cute. We could make this like a climbable tree, and then there's just like a little spiral that you walk up. But that would be hella high poly. And I don't like it for that reason. Sup dog, how you doing? Who would you like to know? Anyone super happy tree in the Yoshi lore? I don't think we should have many little ones if so. I was thinking that they'd be seedlings. The idea is you beat Bowser and that restores happiness to the island, and because of that the seedlings grow. There needs to be something that unlocks and lets you go up here after you beat Bowser too, basically. Same with the other area. Also I think I put that way too high. We don't need it that high, there's no reason for that. Oh hell nah. I think I moved it too low. I moved it too low, that's fine. Maybe super happy tree roots poking out of the ground? I mean, it kinda works, but doesn't it just limit us even more? You were talking to ChatGPT and ChatGPT's head to add sonic slopes to Mario 64? What a great idea. What's ChatGPT's next idea? 4 player split screen? I talked to my ChatGPT and it said that I should not add sonic slopes to Mario 64. It said if I do that, it would be terrible. Have you all seen the seahorse emoji exploit in ChatGPT? If you ask it to show you the seahorse emoji, it just keeps showing you a wrong emoji and then saying haha, nope, just kidding, that's not it. And then it shows you another wrong emoji and it goes haha, nope, just kidding, that's not it. And it keeps doing this for way too long. Okay, this is slightly too long. ChatGPT's next idea is a cycle accuracy in 64 emulator, am I right? Or am I right? I think this should be a good idea. I've been being leafed and when you step on it, it throws you up. But then the question is, why would this grow after you beat the second Bowser level? What's the idea to allow? Sorry, I missed it. I should just go to 4-6, why do I keep going in? I should just go to 4-6, why do I keep going in? It's a nice way of doing it because they will still be part of the big tree and you can make them look like whatever you want. But how do you climb a root also? How would the platforming on that look? Would it just be curved, like a curved root? Then the root curves up here and you can just walk on it because it's climbable. Oh, like a slide, you automatically slide up, what's on? That sounds kind of crazy. Is that Bowser sawed off to remove even more power from the island? Yeah, honestly that works, especially with the Yoshi here, he could tell you some shit about it. Hang on with the camera on this bridge, it's because there's little holes here. Well, I want to avoid making the player jump from leaf to leaf, I think that would suck. That would suck. But if we have a sawed-off roof here and Yoshi said, oh no, Bowser destroyed the roots of the Super Happy Tree when he took over and now it's all damaged, unless we can bring back happiness to the island. It won't regrow or something. And then there's just the root here with maybe two leaves and you jump on the leaf and the leaf bounces you up like a little trampoline. And then after you've done that, maybe the whole thing goes up here and you can bounce from leaf to leaf and you need to do two or three bounces to get up here. I think that could work. I think I kind of like that. I think I kind of like that. I think I kind of like that. The end of the room wraps around you and picks you up and wraps you up there to remove the bounce. True. Let me use this material again. Let me use this material again. I was thinking something like this might be okay. This probably needs a different texture. Nice! Oh, I should have done that. Oh, I should have done that. Oh, I should have done that. Oh, I should have done that. Why didn't I do that? No, now it's too late. It was such a good idea and I didn't do it. It was such a good idea and I didn't do it. Missed opportunity. Hello, THWACK. See a cat stand. Cat stand. The name has so many symbols in it. I feel like this would have little dots in the middle or like little pieces of organic material. I don't know. Is this like a difficult texture for me to pick? Not something like this. It needs like little round circles on it. Kinda like this, I guess. Can I make this work? I think this has potential. But the indents are a little too rough. What if we add shade color to it? I don't like it, actually. That's not a good texture at all. Hmm. I don't know. Alright, the My64Underpart has free camera. Is that something that could work on an N64 cartridge? I mean, what does free camera mean to you? I like this texture here. This looks cool. So it regrows from a cut down trunk or is it going to be a patch of dirt with a seedling planted? It regrows from a cut root. I don't know. Really, I'm trying to get over here. Do do doo do do do do do... Do you guys think I'm going to get in trouble for releasing Dark Mario? Well, it's called Substance Wars 64. It's like a roguelike first-person shooter. I'm a bit worried that people will be mad at me for reasons beyond my understanding. How could you do this? I'm a two-year-old child... ...and you put drugs in Mario 64... ...and now I get posted as? My relationship with Blender, Curse of the Golden Transorder... ...has been robust since at least 2014... ...and they still haven't added a checkbox to fix it. Goddammit. That sucks. Reminds me of a neat C-button joystick. Right, so obviously you can just... ...use a second controller to get... ...you know, that type of camera movement. And I have done that before. The problem with doing that is that when you do that... ...you get people that have no idea how to set up an emulator... ...who just have, like, Player 2's joystick set to your Player 1 joystick... ...and then you create Player 2's joystick for the camera input... ...and it just ends up turning the camera while they move... ...and they don't know what's going on. Don't think people will be mad? I hope you're right. That could be something kinda like this. I don't think I'm able to stream tomorrow... ...because we are going to Zena's... ...uh, Zena's, what are they called? Zena's family? Relatives! That's the word. Let me see if we prime this up. Oh no, you gotta use it right now! Hmm. Now that I think about it, attaching leaves to this feels wrong. Why does attaching leaves to this feel so wrong? Oh, there's leaves on here, I guess. I think we can do that, actually. We just need to look kinda like this. Well, it's supposed to be a reborn route, so... ...I guess, yay? Shit. I think I have them the wrong way around. ... Yeah, let's do it like this. Cool, cool, cool, cool. ... Okay, there we go. ... I think that will mostly work. What if the eel was a dragon that you could stand on? The eel? Oh, you mean the eel from Jolly Roger Bay? We are using him. And he is a comedian in this game. ... Because in the world of Mario 64, comedy is not dead yet. ... The walk gets left without even saying goodbye. ... ... ... ... ... ... Can you imagine Biobank reworking this level? Oh my god, it's going to take him like a full year. The load is so fucking big. This one is actually going to be crazy. ... I feel bad for him. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... True. Real. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I think that should work. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... How's the format shields used here? I don't know, I don't know who you are, well okay I know you're the guy that converted the levels from Sketchup, but other than that I don't know, I don't think we talk much. I only ever regret adding people on Discord if they write me messages. Okay but the fact that your 10 year old sister got one means they probably are for children. Interesting. This is fun, it's fun, it's fun to get up here. We did it guys, we made it fun. Now the question is can we reuse the exact same seedling for the other sides. Hello XBM. Maybe there will be a new Pokemon in 25 years, I severely doubt it. You know what, I'd be happy if Lububu became the new Pokemon. Dark Pokemon. Yeah we could do this, maybe. I like that, I think that could work. The one potential problem I see with this is this interfering with the Shy Guy mission. Yeah we definitely still have to do something with the Treeline B Savory. Shall we maybe use a different vine here then, altogether? Yeah this is actually not thought through at all because now the Shy Guys would get in the way with us. Shit, we need a different mechanic. The very idea of blind box figures is insane to me because that creates so much plastic waste. I legitimately think blind box figures, maybe even booster packs for like trading cards should be legal. Even though I enjoy trading cards a lot, I think they should be digital only because of how much trash it produces. Okay, separate idea here. Make the root pop up at different places on the ground making small platforms. I guess that kinda works, but it also messes with the Shy Guy mission. While I do have a more modern setup for the game that pop-ups a little faster than the normal decom, so that might be related. With an accent I can't place that it's Canadian or Western Europe though, it's German. I am from Germany. It's gambling for kids, but you have to admit, gambling is a lot of fun. I guess we got shitty bloatware. Okay, you're using Akamaru 64, that's crazy that it takes a long time to compile, but they might just have a shitty setup. We're from Chaos Edition 1.0. That was a long, long time ago, that's like, what, 2016? I'm a lot more famous for other things nowadays. The Chaos Edition was when I had like 4,000 subscribers. That is true, many things are a little fun until they ruin your life. For example, eating candy, or riding a motorbike, or hanging out in old abandoned nuclear power generators, or Aqua. You know, if I could grow from the tree on the side so I could leave some space for Akamaru to climb, so I could get the leaves from the tree. Yeah, I was thinking maybe we'd just have vines grow over here, and then the floor turns from not climbable to climbable. But I kinda also don't like them very much. And what we could do is we could have a leaf from inside here, or a vine from inside here and grow up here, or we could have a thing that the Shy Guys simply go around. I guess they could just run through them if we make them non-solid from far away. I discovered Kei's channel before he was hacking Mario 64. He was doing crazy stuff back then. No cannon in there? No. It has to be from the happiness returning to the island. It's true, but I don't want to rework the mission. No, I didn't do any of the newer Chaos Editions. I thought they were rather cringe, the Chaos Compacts. I don't know, Romnickers are so cringe. They're like not making any Romnicks at all, unless SimpleFlips announces a competition. Do you even have your own free will? Do you have a passion and a vision that you're striving for, or are you just making things for the big YouTuber to notice you? Why are you even making art if that's all you want to do? I could put something here, I think. That side is mostly free. Well, I guess we don't actually need a free side if they can just touch it and walk around it normally. But it would look stupid. We could also grow the tree from here. Maybe that's the solution. We'll see how that would look. Everyone said that I enjoy it, but when you're not famous, seeing someone with a lot of followers playing and enjoying your game is a crazy feeling. I get that, but the thing is, they're not making Romnicks, unless someone famous is offering to play it. At that point, it feels like you're not making it for the sake of making the thing anymore. Yeah, but they're not even making games they like most of the time, right? It's like troll hacks, and then Halloween hacks over and over, and then troll hacks again. I don't think you're making a thing you want to make, you're just making the thing that will get you attention. There's a great way to get the boost of motivation to start working on your game. I could see it if they weren't also simpleflips-focused. Obviously, yes, that seems to be how people approach it, so that feeling does seem to be very real. I think you're correct, but I don't like it. Hmm. With all... wait a second. Maybe we don't need this whole snob to be the super snob anymore, now that we have the new collision type. Oops. That's a bug. Oops. Yeah, I think we can make the top part just normal floor now. Oops. Still, the thing actually doesn't need to go that far, which is very good for us. We can make this. And then, unfortunately, I do think we will need a second thing. If you market anything to me as it's BE except X is different, then I'm already not wanting to play it. I do not care about BE at all. I've never been interested in it, and the more people bring it up, the less I become interested. I think this can work. Let's try it. Wait. Does BE become popular again? That's a good question. I think people like the vibe of it. I don't know. People have always been somewhat obsessed about the Mario 64 beta, so there being one that gives you more of that, I guess that's what they like. Is it going to grow animation? No. It grows instantly after you beat Bowser 2, so an animation would make no sense. I think this could work. Wait, this is X-Train G3. I didn't know they made an X-Train G3. I like BE, but X-Hack and the X-Swing are good. True. BE, except there's no drama in making it. Just kidding, it's not possible. Dude, the BE drama is so bad. Let me open the Mario 64 Romance channel. And let's just... Oh wait, there's no beta discussion right now? Wait, what? What, there's no drama right now? Oh wait, nevermind. That was probably like 4 hours ago. Dude, there's like a drama every day. That was one 2 days ago. There's one like every other day. That's awesome. That could be a very fun fileback. In a way, I'd be up for it, but I'm just way too busy. And you're gonna be way too busy too. Remember, there's that project coming up. It is a serious project. I am already working on this. Okay, I think this works. Alright, let's cross this off. Okay. Now we need the unassigned Yoshi to also have a dialogue tree. This guy here, he needs a dialogue tree. Yeah, Marty, I'm just a giga busy person. So many projects and things coming my way. It is what it is. What? She says that. She tries to say, but she goes and then you need to pick her up or she's gonna get mad at you. Well, she does get mad at you. She just starts crying. Boy, it's free? Let's download Yoshi. Let's download Yoshi. How does this work again? This one's a minus one. This one's zero. What does the minus one mean? Oh, that's the course index. Oh, it's noisy. Yeah, true. The launch jumper? Okay. What's it look like? Can we show it on screen? Oh, it's noisy. Yeah, true. The launch jumper? Okay. What's it look like? Can we show it on screen? What's it look like? He's starting to look like a heart. He got shot. 5, 5, 9 and 5, 6, 0. 5, 5, 9 and 5, 6, 0. You're casing off so much right now. True, me too. I'm casing that off my mind. See? Bishop, that's the wrong text entirely. Did I export the lava? I did not. No, I clicked the wrong button. And now I need to wait here for a minute for it to do nothing. Okay, we're fine. Which game does music come from? Extreme G3. Okay. Okay, gang, I need opinions here. On my latest video, people are complaining that it's a little difficult to find the path in the 8-bit section here. Now, I ran playtests, and it is true that during the last playtest, people had difficulty finding the way forward here. But I think I've made the way forward pretty clear with the coins. Like, where the hell else would you go? You know what I mean? Is it really unclear? Are those people just crazy? The coins look kinda ugly. What? How? Oh, as in placing the coins there is ugly. Oh, I see. There are rails the people were trying to follow? The only time I've had a playtester follow the wrong direction is when they went this way here. Which you can still win if you go that way, but obviously it's slower. Well, there are no arrow signs in Kalimari Desert, so that is outside of what we can do. But there are these normal signs we put there as guardrails, so you don't try to go there. I mean... Are you able to see the camera without turning so much? I mean, we don't take the camera control away from the player ever. But this is what it looks like when I play the level without turning the camera ever. And so far I feel like I can see everything. I don't know, maybe I'm crazy? Right, that's why the coins here are placed in a way where if you just follow the coins you get to the goal. I don't know, I feel like... Can I chase out a path using single coins? Hmm... I can kinda see it. That was a little weird in concept. Yeah, it is. But I don't think it's bad. I think it's very cool. Cam settings are saved. And I agree, the auto-rotate and through the edge is very annoying. The one in RTLYI is a lot less annoying, I think. I'm trying to see the coin path, like the first left one for example. I'm trying to see the coin path, like the first left one for example. Oh, I see. I see what you mean. Happiness returned and the route regrew. Okay, nice. Let's see if Yoshi's text is working as well. And we can go here. Yeah. No, I don't think that's a good argument. I agree though, that a path made out of coins might be the better option. Although it is a race level, and exploring the race level to find the shortest path is part of the fun. Hello, Maui. Hello, Maui. I want to replay the Shy Guy mission with this active to make sure it works. Let's verify. What if there's a ghost Mario that you have to race and beat like Mario Kart ghosts? Oh shit, that's so cool. That's a very cool idea. And the star could go blue once he reaches the end. But then I have to make a ghost Mario. What? The hell? Is it this? I think it's that. Okay. No, that was not anything engine related. That was me despawning an actor and then not finding the actor. That would have happened in any repository. Okay, yeah, it looks extremely bad. And then they get stuck there. So that's a problem. I guess we can't really do that. Yes. Hmm. Make the vulture only after beating the mission? No. I want this to be independent of that. I want the player to be able to get to the mission and do all that and then later come back. And suddenly there's an invasion happening. I can become Yoshi. I forgot. What we can maybe do is have a collision model. Like so. And see if they go around. It sounds fun to a Marty. Although I definitely cannot store an entire ghost. So I wouldn't want to have a concept like that. Okay. Hello, Malakstein. Goddammit. We can't store the player inputs? We can! Obviously if you do that for however long the mission is, up to a minute, that's a lot of data. A lot more data than a normal Mario 64 save or whatever save. He did not go around. Dang, that sucks. Come on! Blood killed my melon. Yeah, we need another idea. You're Venezuelan? Are you for real? Is it true what people are saying? That people are really happy about it? I can't tell if it's like bots, so I'm really glad that there's a real Venezuelan here. Yeah, I think so too, Malak. No, I've seen him before. I'm confident he's not a bot. Okay. I mean, we could do something like this. We can still get up here. Yeah. Oh, we can scale it up. Oh, so people are legit happy about it. Okay, that's great to hear, actually. It's like a full-on hostile takeover of Venezuela by the US. It's a very scary thought, but if this is consensual with the Venezuelan public, then I guess it's not really bad at all. Yeah. But if it's like this, then you don't get the idea that there was a cut here at all. Then what the fuck is the point? Hmm. If the red rotate doesn't come from the wall, it's not bad. Yeah, that's kind of what I tried just now. It also looked very bad. Okay. We could have it down here. That also looks bad. I think this is just a terrible idea. I think we need something else. I don't think this can be solved like this. You want them to bomb Paris and steal Macron? You think that's worth it? And cover bombs on Paris in exchange for Macron being gone? What do you say? Paris? Paris? Paris. Paris. Bro, if you didn't want me to say the S at the end of the word, maybe you should have spelled without an S. Ever thought about that? The issue with the route? There's Shigers coming from here, and there's a mission for that, so this doesn't work. It's Paris and France. It's Paris and French, and Paris with an IH in English. Paris? No one says Paris? What the fuck? What am I reading? Paris? Oh, it's Paris in German. Paris. Paris. We go to Paris. Well, I mean, it's a name, right? The name doesn't translate, but that's how German speakers pronounce it. Paris. Paris. Paris. Paris. Paris. If French wanted us to say Unreis, they would have spelled it correctly. Exactly, that's what I'm thinking, too. I think the French purposefully spell their words wrong so that people that are not native pronounce it wrong. And then they go, You pronounced my word wrong? That's how they laugh, too. Aw, you fell for my trap. Aw, you fell for my trap. You are so horrendously stupid to fall for my trap. You are so horrendously stupid to fall for my trap. I think we need to make a new seat. Or something else here. How do you pronounce without the S-Zet? How can we make an S-Zet? The problem is without the S-Zet, how do you differentiate the vowel before it being long or short? Or sharp or not sharp? That's the problem it solves. We don't love ha ha ha and ho ho ho but never had love as hon hon hon. That's in a lot of Dexter's Laboratory schemes. If I can guess and you get it wrong, true. What's that from the wall? Is it on the island? We go into the wall, the monster leaves, it's picking it up anyway. Honestly we could try to just fucking put it here. Yeah, you know what, let's just see if we get up there or not. Maybe this has a leg to stand on. Let's try it. Like that, the DMs. Like multiple small vines that are on there. The problem with that is it's not really telegraphed that Bowser destroyed something and that something is going to regrow if we just put it in the wall. I don't think we can unmute his thumb. I mean this is technically enough to get over. But this certainly feels very jank. Maybe if we add one leaf at the front here. No, we need to start with the stump. That's very important. And don't worry, you can always adjust things and that's not overstepping. In Mario Kart, instead of spawning in a different area than the one you are, you need to spawn it only in the area it spawns. There's no telegraphics for something. In normal Mario 64, there's no fix for it. In RTYI, you don't need to do that. Instead I miss, Frogadile wrote something. I don't see the Frogadile message. Oh, nevermind. Something about the letters. I don't think that works. But making the player do all this platforming just to get across the overworld feels a little mean. But at the same time, there's also going to be a map in here and you can just teleport to levels you've been to before. So honestly, I think it's fine. Ankh or free? I'm never going to be an Ankh. I don't think any of Zena's brothers are going to have kids and I don't think my brother is going to have a kid. I will never be an Ankh. Enjoy being an Ankh, losers. I'm not Ankh at all! Okay, nice. We finally move on to part 10. Holy shit, guys. Can you believe it? Part 10. And then this will be part 11. Oh my god, part 11 sucks. Bad. Oh, I hate this. Damn, this blows. And this was supposed to be a secret entrance, right? I remember what this is for. Oh, that's going to be so cool. Alright, let's see what we've got for part 10. Mushroom Plains. Lofty Lumber Leaps via a gondola. Okay, so as soon as you get here, you can jump onto a gondola that takes you to Lofty Lumber Leaps, which is up here. Persona Back Entrance. That is a bunny barrel. This is a windmill. There's a windmill mechanism in the middle. There are wooden planks above this with a bunch of coins. The Conspiracy Theory Yoshi House level. And the Shy Guy Hide and Seek near the base of the tree level. So there's going to be three little secrets here and one level that's very obvious to get to. Part 9's entrance is unrestricted. We got that. Part 11 unrestricted access. We got that. And part 13's entrance with the evil block. We don't have that yet. It's going to be the last block hidden in the overworld. That course is autumn, yes, but... I mean, maybe there should be some leaves around here, yeah. Yes, we originally thought to hide your level somewhere in here. But that ended up not coming to fruition. This is course 11 with Oily Boily Bay. And an oil tanker. And... S5. Manta Ray appears on the overworld and lets you go to Bowser's Yacht. It's all stamped with dice from Owl. It's a magic stone from Owl if you try okay. And then Pinball. After Act 5, Oily Boily Bay, a guy quits his job there and just lives on Yoshi Island looking for new work. It's about a thousand coins or something like that. He builds a pinball machine. He just needs the materials, bro. Okay. There was supposed to be a part 7 access here, but I think we're saying no to that. Part 9's entrance doesn't make any sense, but definitely part 10's entrance. Okay. Oiled up Femboy Bay? No. Okay, we're moving on to the areas that are in Castle Insight. Are you reworking Mario's house? Probably not. Is anything wrong with it? Okay, we're probably putting the gondola here. I like these mushrooms. The mushrooms are very fun. We definitely need to do something about the UV map being all the same, though. I can't stand that part. Let me just randomize it a little bit. Fuck it. We'll randomize it and then fix it. Wait, are they all? Oh my god. I did it wrong. There we go. That's more like it. Alright, that's a little bit of variety. But not Oily Ocean, because that's the most obvious name in the world. It's not the fucking bay. Okay, give me a better name. Oily Boily Bay is so bouncy. You just wanna go Oily Boily Bay! Yippee! You know what I mean? You just bounce up and down. You wanna... Oily Boily Bay! Oily Boily Bay! You know, that's how I feel. Oily Femboy Love Hotel? Your idea has been rejected. Let's see, the gondola would probably be best placed around here. But then it doesn't look like a level entrance. Are you doing another diss track? Against whom? Against Arthur for suggesting Oily Femboy Love Hotel? I think he deserves it. Maybe just Boily Boily Bay? But it's very oily. And the bay part is not what he takes issue with. Although, given that the bay part is what he takes issue with, renaming it into Boily Boily Bay would be very funny. Oily Boily Bay? Hmm. That's not terrible. But bay sounds like water, and it's on water. The problem I have with putting a gondola here is that it doesn't look like a level entrance. Oily-ass place? Hmm, no. Is the oil actually boiling hot to the point it gives you lava damage? Yes. Well, you shouldn't be using Google Sketchup. The thing is, you can use Google Sketchup. Google Sketchup is like buying stuff off Teemo. You're gonna get low-quality garbage, but at least you don't have to put any resources into getting this thing. Same way, you don't have to put any resources into learning Sketchup, because it's so easy. But you're also only going to get low-quality garbage out. Now, I know there's some people that put a lot of work into their Sketchup levels and they end up looking semi-decent, but you're never going to get the quality of a blender level, because you're missing vertex colors and you're missing all the combiners and stuff. Sponsored? This is not sponsored. That is just my honest feelings on the matter. This is just my honest feelings on the matter. And if I level empty, what am I doing? Yeah, UV mapping in Sketchup doesn't work. It just duplicates the texture instead of exporting the UV map, which looks very weird, especially on Mario 64 models. Biomech brought that up to me too, making a level with just the thing that Nintendo developers used back in the day. And I think it could be fun, but I was thinking, why wouldn't we go a step further and make a level entirely in a hex editor? What if I made a Mario 64 level entirely in a hex editor? You know what I'm saying? What if I punch myself repeatedly in the balls? That is very similar to what I just did, just unironically. But imagine how cool it would be. Imagine you could tell people, I made a level in a hex editor. Imagine you could tell people, I made a level in a hex editor. That's against the rules. Did I not mention that? Oh, okay, yeah, if you're typing in something, just assume they're meant for someone else. 1421. Ah, and did I just export the Silver Castle grounds? Oh, I didn't. Okay, all good. Fine. Excess element? Oh my god. I forgot that's how it works. Oh, I forgot that's how it works. Oh, a shipboat? Yes! What? This guy is replying to other chapters? Get out of the house. So, the idea is, as soon as you jump on it, it flies off into the sky and takes you to the level. I think this looks very bad as a level entrance, though. It doesn't feel like a level entrance, it just feels like a random element. So, we need something else here. We need a different way for this to look. What if this looked more like a port for a ship to dock on? And what if it was less inside the level and was more boxed in on the side of the level? I think that could solve those issues. We might have to remove some of the mushrooms here to make space for a ship port. Well, I don't know what you mean by beta, but I certainly prefer Project 64 over Retroarch. Yeah, I was thinking about an area for a dock, but I think just that isn't enough. I think, additionally, it needs to feel more like a dock. So, let's say we put a dock here, where I'm standing, that leads to the ship. I think it would still feel like a mid-level element. Unless we somehow made the side of the ship less accessible from other places? We could also put the port kind of in the sky. Like, if the only way to reach the port was from here, then the ship was just in the middle and was floating up and down. I think that would kind of work. Why can't you mention the OST3 version so much? I'm thinking maybe the dock could be in front of here, with the ship just flying in the sky. Okay. Where are you setting up? Would you replace most of the mushrooms in the center with a wooden dock platform? Most of the mushrooms in the center? You mean like, this one here? I think, yeah, I think that actually has a lot of potential in that area. What does a dock platform look like? Oh, I see. My English is bad, sorry. Can you stand on the fence or is the spin too fast for the camera? They are not solid. Okay. Is Synthony Conservatory short for a sign or is it its own variable? It's the same function. Okay. In your case, where is the D64 file? I will find you. Okay. Well, what's going on in this material? What the hell? This is a weird kind of material. I think I'm just gonna make a copy of it. Yeah, it's a little less weird. So and now we have a little dog here. I like your... I don't even know what the German word is. Maybe readiness for the project? Preparedness? I don't know. Do you also follow German in your chat? I forgot. I prefer if people don't speak German in my chat, because then other chats can't understand it and I don't want to have a conversation just one-on-one with a person that no one else will understand. Will this come out on June 22 for your birthday? Okay, you know what, just for your birthday, we're gonna move the release to that date. I was gonna drop it tomorrow, but if your birthday is on June 22, I'm sure the rest of chat can wait another half a year. I'm sure they don't mind. Yeah, this feels like a level entrance now. What do you think? I don't think I've heard you speak German instinctively on stream, like when you're pissed off. The only German you'll ever hear me speak on stream is... That's German for what? I don't know. All right, I think I'm feeling done for today. Next is adding the warp for the autumn level, making this actually warp to the autumn level, adding a little cutscene for it. And then... I actually think that's everything we need to do here. And then it's, I guess, the question mark block. And then this overworld. Oh my god, this overworld is gonna be so fun. There's going to be a bone dragon here. Until then, bye bye!
