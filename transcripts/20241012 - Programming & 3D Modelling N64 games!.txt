You You Zeina in the house. She is in the house. Just chillin Hello D flow punk Oh Sure, is he I know some weapon What do you think of my echoing radar Oh Jersey is a music direction genre Hello Alex telephone It goes to blue when you're far away if you ask me You No idea you worked out you look good Wait, those are two contradictory statements you saying I Look like I don't work out, but you like that It's a gray scale texture, sorry, so not gonna happen realistically speaking What those and blinking lights and do they tell you where the icons are So the closer to an icon you are and the faster and blinks and the red I guess so like Right now you see the second one is blinking a lot that's because the spawning here gives you the egg coin If you do a tutorial Sorry, you have the icon so blue corner is gonna spawn but that's what it means I Know the ocean party. Oh You've never seen my face before I see That makes sense, too Although I stream pretty regularly Usually when people will come to my stream, I don't assume that they're like for so much So this radar is only gonna show up during the seventh act and Before that It's just gonna show Either gray or golden if you have to coin already My guys pulling something it's Sonic Adventure 1 but yeah It is very similar to that Then you can buy this radar with coins you can but I Added the Yoshi coin mission as the seventh star in the act select if you count here, there's no seven stars instead of six Yeah, so when you have the coin collected it's just golden now You It's uncollected it should be gray it is gray Anyone remember any of the Yoshi coins we put in this level I don't oops Oops Play as I do with mods to make the indicator better Very arguable. Sure. It makes the game easier, but it makes the knuckles mission feel less like a treasure hunt, you know more like a Go everywhere a fucking idiot type thing Oh The indicators are supposed to show when the game is paused There's also a glitch when it appears that's weird I Make the radar appear automatically Then you're just not gonna be able to buy it anymore It's moved from an item to something that's always there because okay Imagine this situation imagine you have not bought the radar and you're doing a mission 7 and the game doesn't give you any hint at All that's gonna suck That's gonna be a miserable experience people are gonna hate that and I want to avoid that experience happening to anyone This looks like a good song we're listening to this And This gives the lens even less value if you struggle by the radar You're not gonna know there's a radar and you also don't know that the coins don't have any value You have no idea what I'm planning with the coins Hello infinity v0 I    Trust me the coins are not gonna feel worthless the coins are gonna feel very cool They're gonna feel more valuable than Mario Odyssey Enjoy this completely inexpensive you hope that there's more than I haven't seen yet In Welcome to the stream So we have a but Where the lights here in this area do not appear for some reason and I don't know why Lila I And when you blend with the coins The coins are gonna be there to buy over what upgrades so like maybe there will be a guy that wants to build a bridge But he needs a donation of 500 coins to buy the materials. So you give them the money and then the overall changes You're actually gonna affect the world by giving people money That's gonna be so cool And make the old for the demo no  What I don't understand this why these lights here don't spawn Being today Working on bucks for the demo. We might even in 64 test the whole demo reason later in a bit But of course one is getting rid of this time Most of the course when we were just done now, so there really isn't much missing. There's just some dynamic lights I want to add to this area here And there is a line of mushrooms that my bike is working on that I need to put in Did you collect this yourself No, it's sliding But I'm just someone finds a way to make a patch to walk to levels that aren't in the demo the game is going to crash Because the levels are not gonna be in the demo There will be a second demo and the second demo will be only course one Hello, did someone just donate and I didn't see it. Thank you for the resub Davey The rain isn't posing Okay If you don't want to see the radar just go to like x6 x6 is the same as x7 except without the radar You Definitely do not want these to calculate the angle to Mario the fuck We also don't need this actually don't need any of these flags It's behavior lights not behavior light Hello rain fly This is a really weird box because they just Won't show up Which is extra extremely concerning because they don't see a reason these wouldn't spawn hello by your back Any news on an intense strike topic I saw don't tell me what this video is back I Only have information like helps close But I'm still a hundred percent certain that he got struck by an imposter Did you see the radar earlier by a bike I can show you I Will show you the coin radar you're gonna like this I think You So I took the plunge and I made this change Instead of six stars. There's now seven stars in the act select and the last act is always called find the egg coins and If you select find the egg coins You get a radar And this works like the Sonic Adventure 1 radar where if you get closer to the source of the egg coin The radar starts blinking more So here this one's like almost red because the bunny is right here Or if you go up here The icon will be right here. So the radars red When you always have the same shirt, I only own like five or six shirts I Something wrong with the bounce flow slides, let's me investigate This might just be another case of an evil material This looks right to me It's this I'm the Yoshi can equates on so name. It is a Yoshi coin. I Don't see an issue with the lighting here Think the blinking eyes are a bit distracting. We can try to make them less distracting. I can make them blink slower The lighting changes abruptly Let me check This seems pretty smooth to me No, I can't actually see the view count unfortunately, I'm one of those people that likes to see the view count, but I just can't Project 64 is more convenient. That's why power launcher keeps having updates and I fucking hate it In the showcase video it's broken what I might have fixed it and not realized it The lighting on Mario was very broken I fixed it since the last showcase, so that's probably why No, it's good that the software supported it's still fucking annoying you don't need to make an update for every little thing Or Maybe you could do the updates in the background without prompting me Or you could have one update that updates like all course and not six different pop-ups Turn of updates, okay, but then what's the value of parallel launcher for me? I only use parallel launcher to test if my game works on power launcher because I will never personally myself use power launcher So it needs to be up-to-date Yes, exactly Yoshi party Okay, so the crystal light we are clearly placing it in the level It is in the level is active on this act, but its function does not run. I have I Found the issue There's a functionality in the Mario 64 engine where if you set the beep harm free to 255 the object does not spawn This is so fucking wild I Have an idea for Chris 15. Yes, all the main courses are now planned and we already have some work done for each of them I'm not sure about linking out the egg in itself. We confusing if the eggs are red green yellow in a level. Oh, you're right So, do you have a better idea To Do you see guys replace one of my missions? Yes 100 commissions do not exist anymore Points are global now The outside area of course 13 is not done yet You Yeah, now it looks like a glowing mushroom Of course 15 is a space arcade course 14 is the craft world because 13 is the ice castle All three of them need some work still but because 13 is basically done because 14 is mostly done because 15 is a pathway This is a weird song I don't want to listen to this I Was listening to nightcore that will be today's stream We're going retro My first thought is something under the icon or a 3d arrow on Mario I Think a 3d area is too distracting and it's also giving you too much info. I think that kind of ruins the fun of the treasure Yeah, because I already programmed a lot of assets for our tea time We can look at the Yoshikan radar again see if there's any changes we want to make I Actually think that the golden color by default they have is already a little bit weird Last night will be a star in the game. No Although I will probably use some of the materials I used on the slide for it the game But the slide as it was in This kind of a keg will not be returning No idea Davy probably quite a bit difficult Are the icons color according to level right now? No But it is doable Right instead of golden we could have to be pink here, which I agree. That would be a good change Keep in mind also the intention here is that if a coin is collected it will already be colored in instead of blinking and The gray ones are ones that are not in the area you're currently in So if I went to the area with this coin here then another coin would light up But yeah I can't see how if we change these to be the color of the coin in the level On one end it would kind of be better on the other end It would also just gonna be confusing with the radar blinking so much I will adopt with the pulsating halo within the icon with the pulsating. Halo I'm not sure. I understand maybe I can find a dot for the pulsating Do you mean like just a line on top of the icon that pulsates? I kind of prefer it with a low getter for each coin at the same time just because it makes hunting more fun it keeps you in the level some more though so the blinking of the eye can stun a gray skin game color the closer to the coin you are maybe i mean that's pretty doable but that's gonna be a lot less dynamic yeah changing the color always is an issue with collected x already because we already use all the colors for the collected coins or yoshi coins three nodes is growing plus drinking no there is an issue with um right now one pixel of texture is exactly one pixel of output on a nintendo 64 so if we grew or shrunk it that would look really bad we're searching the flash for sin squared or maybe a time um sin squared i can already do that as in i use the square root of the brightness and then multiply it with 255 so that the fall off instead of like chuck chuck it's like we could absolutely make it go whiter the closer you get or something like that but me we're currently thinking about the radar the problem with the radar is um someone brought up the linking the blinking might be a little bit distracting and also an issue is that the coin that exists in the level is a different color per level so by using all the colors from yellow to red here already or from green to red here already we will often overlap the actual color of the coin in the level which is confusing and then there's a collected icon too cave level is white x i think it might have those you know is man the hole in the cave looks so poopy now that i look at it look at that oh no they're yellowish but that doesn't make it any better  yeah all right there's another one here man the mirror looks so good it's not this type of radar we can't have that or well we can but i don't think we want they kiss the girl and like the true how many years i've been coding 45 music sounds awful nope i don't know how long i've been coding i don't it's yeah i think about game not about me i want game what other types of radar are there so there's definitely brightness which can be used there's saturation which could be used we could make it blink towards the color of the yoshi coin in the level right so imagine the base rgbs were the same as the color of the coin in the level and then we blinked lurking towards that  it does spawn faster than the area again then the question would be what do we use for uncollected coins we had this before where it's just like the outline of a coin but this is awful i don't think i want the outline but there's definitely something here that can be done been waiting and waiting for you to let go could i also use the rumble pack i don't wanna i have disabled the rumble pack so far the rumble bag requires a whole new thread just for itself so it's like no i don't own a rumble pack so that would be an issue shit i just realized i have an important facebook message to send i was thinking of picking up a second n64 um so i wanted zainab to pick that up a semi-transparent icon possible yes we can and definitely do transparency a little bit darling is this ttmid's font if it feels all right when you drop it low and break me off no she doesn't mind no she doesn't mind no she doesn't mind girl i got your soul push it back on it bring it back sounds like ant bleeding play a roller i don't know what font this is okay so do we want transparency blinking because that's absolutely possible would that even look good though what if the uncollected coins were just more transparent icons we can't do that she doesn't mind no she doesn't mind no she doesn't mind girl i got you so wrong blender file this maneuver is gonna cost us 15 years i don't think it'll look good i have my doubts too girl same time a time she a time it girl same time i line me align me talk people sign it prime me a primate girl just in a crime we a climate girl set the temperature to climate doesn't matter what you call it then only bad programmers care about the programming language i mean i can just like support it for now and we look at it that's gonna not cost very much time at all yeah that would be the idea david i think i turned around yeah but i'm afraid it's too late to apologize it's too late oh it doesn't look awful although it doesn't look as nice as i would like we can increase the transparency as the blinking increases you can hang from the bottom of ropes and climb your way across somewhere reachable i mean if you have a good location for that maybe i can't this is not how i wanted this  this is kind of nice honestly the closer you are to it the more solid it gets i have not and i don't care about b-chart we really don't need more programming languages c can already do everything we need so what does chad think about the transparency idea to remove the presidential confusion with already collected coins do dude i can't listen to this shit this fucking sucks please i can't listen to this anymore oh it's too much attention to itself it's a little bit distracting okay but this is during the mission where you collect the icons right the entire point of this is to collect these icons oh like a logo below it yeah this is kind of nice so so okay wait how did what i did just now even work at all because like i said color right after it doesn't make any sense because you use a display list to display things how else are you going to display things do so foreign foreign  i see you i still stress on the m6 and then into a negative this is it yeah well this comes with the n60 world i'm sure and transparent too never played pizza tower so i don't like or dislike it but i probably wouldn't like it because i don't like 2d games so all the female were already collected it didn't display because i forgot to disable this whoops what is two and a half t i need a definition first before i can answer the question what the hell this is not doing at all what it's supposed to
