Right, we have to make the rope today. Oh no, let's see how far we get. Hello Bingus, welcome to the stream. All right, can't cause the forbidden combination. Do not call me daddy. I like Stardew Valley, been into Stardew Valley lately, never played it, but I don't like Harvest Moon, so I probably wouldn't like Stardew Valley either. Hello Sully, interesting new name. Hello Franklin Delano Bluth, what a fucking name. That's a mouthful. Good evening Franklin Delano Bluth. I do UV map levels, yes. If I did not UV map the levels, they would look awful. Hello Ditatz. Let's see if we have the old or new Yoshi design. I have no idea, what's the difference? So off stream I implemented some stick optimizations again. I think I am pretty much close to finishing all my engine changes that I want now. There really is not much missing, just Kotlin animations, which is just mostly like a drag and drop in code, and the OS, and then the Geoarrays, which I should be able to get done like tomorrow or so. Super Marbled or the UPStory one? I have no preference, they're both great. I'm very much looking forward to the engine just being done, because when the engine is done, that means we are no longer gonna break our old stuff all the time, which is great news. Also today I spent most of the day removing almost all the unused Mario64 code, all the unused behaviors, so that no one can claim I am using Mario64 code, or distributing it, or whatever. That's nice. Damn it, why damn it, you wanted to claim that I'm using Mario64 code? I foiled your plan. Little Benjamin. 764 code, hopefully never. You made a spelling error. You need to atone for your sins. Go directly to jail. Wow, why does it look so terrible? Wow, why does it look so terrible? Oh, oh, I think I see why. Ha, ha, ha, ha. There we go. Oh. Hello, SeltonXD. Hello, Kelsight and the lion. Hello, hello. For some reason these last few days I felt really low energy. I don't know what it is. Maybe the sun is killing me. Hello, Samitizer, I haven't seen you in chat in a while. You were pinging me last time while I was streaming, so I couldn't respond. I forgot what your question was. I would have answered, but I wasn't able to. Oh, yeah, dude, the weather's killing me. Sea of Stars OST, I am fine with that OST. We do need an OST for today. Let's do it. Are you trying to create a rope? I'm not just trying, dude, I'm fucking succeeding. Okay, they changed the hotkeys. Oh, no, maybe I'm not succeeding. I'll do something about it. In previous videos, it seemed to imply that you only need one bone for a gobarbaro model. Referring to request two bones. No, it only requires one bone. It's always one bone. You must be doing something weird if you need two bones. I don't know who told you that you need two bones, that's just wrong. I don't know who told you that you need two bones, that's just wrong. We have 203 bones. How many of those do you need, though? We're just using one bone for a part of a model. Bow mod part stays still when the object rotates. At least it's off-center from the center of the object. Yes, well, that depends on how you want to do it, right? If you want it to be billboarded with an offset, there's a way to do that. It should just work, right? If you look at the billboard comments, let's see, geoprocess billboard. Yeah, see, it takes a translation in, so it shouldn't stay still. You must have done something wrong. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna give this whole thing the alpha transition that Biobank was talking about. It's gonna make it look like the rope is coming in as the whole thing unfurls, and it's gonna look really good. I'm not sure how you even got it to stay still. If you just offset the bone, then the whole thing should be billboarded. I don't know, I would have to see your image to be able to tell you what's wrong. So that's the command with an offset, but it doesn't rotate with the object, it just stays in the same place offset from the center. I mean, if you think about this, I'm gonna say command with an offset, but offset doesn't rotate with the object. Oh, so like the offset happens first and then the billboard matrix happens? Now that doesn't check out to me from the code here. Right, this just rotates and keeps the offset the same. Maybe you're trying to do something wrong. I think you're thinking about this wrong. I can imagine what's going on is that you have a billboarded part that you always want to face the camera, but you also want that part to... How do you describe it? Like you want it to rotate with the object, or you want it to rotate with the billboard itself, so you would have to offset the model data and not the bone. Well, that depends, right? Are you performance sensitive or not? Because if you're not performance sensitive, then yes, it does not matter. Like if I look at my drug Mario hack, which is very much not performance sensitive, I do similarly inefficient stuff with the billboard. It's very much not performance sensitive. I do similarly inefficient stuff all the time, just because it doesn't matter. Oh yeah, which one would be cleaner right now? Well, you can only have it one way or the other. You can have it fast, or you can do it correctly. Or maybe not correctly, but optimally. Okay, I'm thinking something like this for the rope. And then the way it's going to work is the spool is here, you push down the spool, the spool lands, that should all look fine. Then how do we animate this part here? We could just cut this out of the camera. Like you push to pull down, spool down, the animation goes like this. And the spool falls off screen. And then we scroll down to reveal that this is happening. Oh, this isn't even the coolest part. Just wait until you see the final animation in game. Because we need this rope to appear dynamically. So this is actually going to be animated. We're going to have the rope appear by a spool unfurling. That's going to be the cool part. Let me just make sure there's no oddity with this. 194. Shorten it by 19. That's 147. Ignore correlation, put it on area 1, please. Just make sure it works. And then we look at it in game. Do you keep parts of your level separate meshes until the end and then connect to Germany, remove all of Germany and stuff? Or does it just separate meshes in the final? No, in the end I make sure that there's as few geodisplayless comments as possible. Because that makes performance a little better. But that's the final step. The level did not export. How come? Is it because I was missing a picture? It is. The rope to the floor while Mario is climbing? No. I'm not sure where you got that idea from. Oh, big mistake I made. I should not have triangulated this. Hello, Biobank. Yeah, exactly. You want to maximize editability until the very last step. I only fuse stuff after Biobank's rework is done nowadays. Is there a reason to make the bowling alley's rope rotate like that? Gee, polygonal efficiency is what I call it. You get rounder visuals without adding any polygons. You get more polygon per polygon, you know? Two polygons for the price of one. Biobank, I think what we have to do is make the spool fall off, off camera, and then reveal that this is done. Because, like, holy fuck. You know what I mean? How the fuck else am I gonna do this? I don't want to vertex animate this all happening. It didn't get very complicated at all. Did I misunderstand the idea? Oh, right, first 64 can't export this correctly. Well, it used to be able to, but I guess now it can't. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Um, eight, three, five, five. What's the smallest we can go? Can we go to minus six? We can't go to minus six, okay, so we need to put this at one shift. Just as a test, let's multiply texture one here. Okay, you see how this texture is now a gradient? You're trying to draw at some point where it looks deflated instead of round. Yeah, yeah, of course, but I want to do that after your vmapping. Like, now it's a good point. Oh, it's a triangle, it's completely wrong. So, you know what? This is better than having to UV map it while it's still un-triangulated. So, a quick explanation to it. So, you know, this jumps just straight off the ground and it jiggles around when this ball comes off and then it gets converted to a static object. I kind of like this though. So, you only want to flex the color animation. What do you think about that again? Well, the cool thing about this is that, uh, actually, no, this doesn't actually make sense, physically speaking. Okay, wait, so your idea was to spool this here, it falls off, and then... Okay, yeah, you know what? Yeah, that's a bad idea. Fuck it, more going with your idea. You were thinking like so, correct? So, all right, yeah, we're going with your idea. That's a bad idea. So, yeah, of course. Let me just think about how to actually pull off the alpha gradient here. What's the best way to do it? Yeah, those hotkeys work just fine without the numpad. Or what's the issue? So, actually, we should just set blend color. Blend color is easier than primitive color. Alpha 64 simulate blend color. I don't think it can. No, definitely not. So, okay, when we set the blend color up... This needs to be shorter, actually. Like so. Okay, when we set the blend color up, what's going to happen is, um, it's going to start rendering up until the blend color alpha value. So, if you have an alpha value of like 230, it's going to render like this part. And then while the spool is moving, we're going to decrease the value. So, like right here, it might be at 180. And then it's going to end up until here. And then as we go down, we're going to decrease the value until we're here, which is 32. 32 is the lowest value. Just scroll the texture. Um, that probably works too, but it's a bit more annoying to set up with Fast64. So, I think I'd rather just do it this way. Your buck is a hard quirk! QUACK! Really?! Okay, here we go. Your buck is a hard quirk! QUACK! Really?! Wait, what the fuck? Let me fix this. Okay, so you guys remember the white yellow, uh, the yellow lighthouse? Can you move the uv slash s low in code? Yes, but you need to write directly to the display list for that. Which, um, one race condition it can happen one frame early. Two, you need to find it, which is annoying as fuck. So if I just set the blend color via a geocomment, it's easier. And it's gonna have the same precision, so there's no difference really. So we have to have another 40 coordinates. So So that means we need to do the lighthouse differently though, which is very unfortunate. But this lighthouse just will not work the way it is because of the RGBA32 texture. So this is the Sea of Stars OST. Oh right, it was this cursed shit. Damn dude, what? So the classic camera-based lighting, I don't even think it's gonna be the best lighting we can get on a cloudcap level. For sure, for sure. But that means no vertex colors. So vertex colors just aren't good at all. But you can use vertex alpha, right? You should use vertex alpha to like darken the parts inside the clouds to give it like fake shadows. Okay nice, this works already. So I have terrible news for you guys though. Today is going to be a short stream because I am invited to a barbecue. I know, it sucks. Barbecues are the worst. And we can finally put the baby in water. The baby loves playing in water. They have a pool party. Hey Lila, you seeing this? You seeing this right here? Run the mtxf. You see what I did? You see it? You see it? Isn't that cool? Isn't that cool? We did it. Dang, you don't like barbecues? Holy. Some energy goes outside, who thought standing around a big fire smoke thing would be a summer activity? True, actually. Give this man a true. So this is how rgba32 multitech just works. Hmm, that makes sense. Wait, what is the flex thing here? Wait a second, what does this do? Oh, duh. Stupid. So what's the rgba problem? I have rgba32 textures in the model right now. When you use an rgba32 texture, the way that the machine loads it into texture memory is it loads the rng component to the upper half of texture memory and the bng component to the lower half of memory. That means for every byte you use, you are also using one extra byte at the bottom of texture memory, right? So if you fill half the texture memory, you actually fill like a quarter and another quarter, meaning only a quarter of texture memory remains instead of half. So effectively, that means whenever you use an rgba texture, instead of 2048 bytes remaining, you only have 1024 bytes remaining in texture memory. Meaning this is for multitextures. It is an issue. Did I not do it right? Do it with the seed you're allowed to sleep in the day. I've been trying or wanting to sleep in the day too. I forgot to export a level, that's the issue. You just naked on the bed, ass to the fan, just fucking fan out your ass. You're gonna be so swampy otherwise. That's the play. Experts are saying there's heatwaves. Honestly, just felt like kind of a cold summer to me so far. I feel like all the other summers we've had before were warmer here in Canada. That being said, this is only my third summer? Fourth? Third? Third. Oh, I am feeling fortunate this year. You're in Snowland, I know. Hello, Nitomare. Do you think global warming will make most of Canada inhabitable and bring prosperity to the land? You know, everyone dies, but Canada gets a bunch of extra space. Wouldn't that be sick? Um, still not working. I guess I'm setting the blind color. I'm like a fucking idiot. I'm gonna eat sloppy steaks in the water pool today. You guys know that sloppy steak sketch? I fucking love that show. I love how bad it is. Oh, you see that? Okay, we lose quite a bit of precision for no reason here. It will not look smooth, it will look smooth. You have to keep in mind most of the thing is going to be inside the hole, or inside the geometry. So you won't even see that. What's going on in Canada? Yes, I know. I'm saying maybe global warming happens, and the snow melts upwards. And then like, we get more space to live in, you know? Actually, you know what? It doesn't matter. Canada has so much global space, but they'd rather just have fucking trees everywhere. Trees and mountains. Because I need it for dropping the rope down. There's gonna be a spool that you just push. Why does it start pulling at such a low value? That's what doesn't check out to me. Doesn't make sense, right? Also, North Canada is just rock? Really? It's not like land you can live in? What actually is dirt? This is a stupid question. What's in dirt? So tasty stuff on the ground. Okay, but what did I put in there? How did I make it taste so good? It's weird to bring like that. It's almost like this is not what it's intended to be in the end. People are willing to move there. It's from the time of Vikings. What? Crunch from the rocks, texture from the sand, taste from the worms and other insects. Okay, but like, what is it made out of? There's no way it's just rocks, right? Is it just decayed plant material? All of it? Is it all poop? Is the whole dirt just poop? What's the chemical composition? Um, so I think I want to program this, so I'm just gonna make a standard model for now. I think it's rock. There's no way dirt is just rock. Nothing on Twitter is real. It's all like, bots. I don't believe a single opinion I see on Twitter. It's genuine. There's rocks and there are dead animals? Dirt is poop? You would pay a high 18 million to do a line of coke? Yeah, maybe they get rid of us like that. Maybe that's how they understood it. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Dude, the fucking view distance is so awful. 400 is too big? We want about half of that. The thing that makes me go insane is that grass developed at some point in history, and for some time dinosaurs existed, there was no grass anywhere. Well, it was probably all mosses and grass adjacent creatures, right? I don't believe for a second that there was no like, basically the same as grass, but not genetically, technically speaking, grass all around. This is what I was trying to do. There we go. So there's gonna be a spool of rope, and I'm gonna just give it a placeholder texture. Sand, clay, and organic materials. Just some small parts of metal and rock. Fungus exited out another sector for hundreds of feet, and then it goes disabled, but fungus created dirt. So... So... I'll do something like this for a start. This is a rotating thing, so I do need shade color on it. Which means I need to cycle, because I need to color this in with primitive color. Maybe we can do something cool here. What if... Let me think about this. How do we do this? We could subtract primitive color, multiply by shade here, and then multiply by shade alpha here, and then we instead invert this color here. Let's do something like that. Kind of a crisp combiner. So... And now we can actually vertex color this. Isn't that fucking sick? How cool is that? Not that cool? Fuck you, Lila. How dare you? You're so rude to me. Doing subtractive perm since you have fetus? Not true. Yo, what the fuck is going on in this view mode? Oh, that's the texture paint view mode. No wonder it was weird. So... Your ice pick is hot. You deserve it, dude, for saying that. Most deserved ice pick getting hot in the world. So... Who buys a rope by this floor? The Yoshis, I guess. Also, the reason we get as harsh zoning laws are probably the same as always keeping body rights as a retrieval. Of course, I was thinking that too. But like, if you're rich, you can be like, oh, we want to preserve nature, and like, oh, that's like a bang argument. Oops, hit my microphone. I hope that wasn't too loud. Yeah, I was saying that before, like, property prices are high not because a couple people buy a bunch of houses, but rather because zoning laws are so strict, making it impossible to buy- build new houses cheaply. Right, because if it was people building- buying that many houses, wouldn't people just build cheaper houses? Right, like, why wouldn't you do that? No, it has to be that they made it so expensive to build new houses. You've seen twine on a spool? I don't know what that is. Awful take? Wait, how? I don't know what they're saying. Yep. He wasn't just gonna- yeah, because it's- there's more, like, permissions you need to get. More- you know, it's- this is something companies have been doing forever. This is like a genuine thing they do, where they make- if you want to get into an industry, they make the price for it really high. Like, you need to get so many certifications, you need to buy so many things, and like, big stores obviously have no issue doing that. But that puts smaller competitors out of business. It's the same with houses, I think. I don't know, maybe that's stupid. No, it's not stupid. That's exactly what's going on, obviously. Obviously this is different when you are genuinely living in an area where space is an issue. It's just- in Canada, it most certainly is not. I turned at the wrong point, I hope not. I mean, housing prices are not an issue for me. I have a house now, I benefit from the prices going up, so I'm not mad. Okay, and then developers' associations have presented evidence that they are fighting tooth and nail with commercial owners just to build a residential. I mean, as long as people don't realize, I guess it doesn't matter, right? I mean, to the politician. I did not pay it in full yet, but once you take the mortgage on, the price of the house doesn't increase anymore. It's locked in. Oops, that's the wrong level. So, so, I mean, if you want capitalism without government, that's the whole point of the board game Monopoly. Like, you see what happens. I don't think that helps. My mom, while we moved out of the house, did I say the right thing? The price increased after she had already bought the house? That's not how it works, Lina. Your mom lied to you. Raise the property value. Oh, so she had to pay higher property taxes? That's a completely different thing. So, in most countries, you have to pay 1% of your house's value every year in property tax. So, if she has a house, but she has no income, then that might happen. Like, put you out of business. Property climbable. Now, it's just there to piss the player off. We want them to think they can climb it, and then you can't. And then we laugh at them. So, for now, I'm just gonna do it like this. Hello, Prime Minister Bikini Bottom. Do private owners of private owners be more religious in your land? I don't understand. Yep. Step with condition is what I called it. So, all right, we should now have a very basic version of the thing working, which is the spool just unfurls, and then the rope appears. So, I'm just compiling. Well, no, the point in Monopoly is kind of that, because you own everything, you get to just decide the price. So, you can put it as high as you want, which is the issue. Where is my spool? Huh? Where did the spool go? Oh, this would be an issue. Need Y offset. 100 graph Y offset. Oh, Zeyna wrote me. It's like their schedule. Oh, well, I guess I can stream slightly longer. It was meant to not be fun. I know. I think the problem is that, as usual, the more influence you have, the easier it is to gain more influence with power. So, every system you design is self-eroding in that sense, which is an issue. Or well, every system we have. Whether you want government or not, whether you want capitalism or not. So, let me sell you a piece of land that doesn't worth anything to them relative to what you're willing to pay for it. Well, because maybe other people want that, too, and then that has value to them. That's the thing. Like, let's say I'm literally the only person in the world that is able to give this raw mech to anyone. Let's say there was theoretically no other way anyone could get this raw mech. I could just decide to give it to people at whatever price I want. I bet there'd be someone willing to pay like a thousand dollars for it, so I could just give it to them for a thousand dollars, even though that's a completely unfair price for a game, most likely. Oh, this has such a low precision, it's kind of LMP. Maybe I can do it for more than a thousand. I didn't know Blend Color Alpha would be so... low precision. But it's fine, we can hide that in the spore. So... Of course I wouldn't. I'm just giving this guy an example of how you can be evil. When you have a monopoly on something. Obviously the rumming is a bad example. What about drinking water? Let's say you own all the drinking water. You can charge however much you want. You can make drinking water like probably a thousand dollars a month, and people would just have to suck it up. Hello, XPM. Lila is not people. Right, I forgot. Lila is an ape. Monopolies are not actually occurring except from reservoirs such as the kingdoms. Okay, that's probably why we disagree then, because I feel like monopolies are a natural emergence of like an unregulated market. You can see it with like game companies buying other companies right now, right? I didn't get that myth. I was also joking. What now? The end, shit, true. She's an it-girl. Isn't that a thing, it-girls? Dude, what happened to VSCO girls? You guys remember that trend? The what-trend? The VSCO-girl-trend. They went, they did like, what was it, this was probably fucking Vine or Musical.ly, and it went sksksk, and they had these water bottles. They did it for like, two months, and then they like, graduated from first grade and stopped. Look at Texas, China, India. I don't know anything about those countries. Isn't China very regulated too? I don't know, Texas isn't even a country. Isn't Google kind of a monopoly? And they kind of got like, slammed for that recently, I know because my stocks went down a lot. Oh yeah, monopolies happen if you abuse regulation. It's a lot easier for a monopoly to happen, yes, that is also true. Yeah, but it's annoying as fuck. Like, it has to be real, it's annoying as fuck. So instead of this, we're gonna make it so that Mario pushes it. Adding random memes to this. Okay, now, why is the collision so offset? Does this not respect ograph offset y? I'm guessing it does not. It does not. And we need to not calculate the collision distance, and just set it manually. Okay, is this my delta rune? I have not, that's true. I'm waiting until the game is done. It's ograph offset y, not ocol offset y. Wait, that's actually a good point. Now that I think about it, I might have used it somewhere before. Fuck. I don't think I can do this, fuck. I need, I need a different solution. What's past half the way halfway, Magliela, what are you talking about? Yes I use it everywhere, TRC. Okay, so what, am I supposed to like, play the game over 5 years to want me to play 2 minutes a day? The fuck? Okay, I still don't wanna play 2 minutes a day. Fuck you. And we're gonna have to just, we're gonna have to commit a little bit of a crime here. Okay. This game better be designed to be played at once, I don't wanna play it in chunks. I'll be honest though, I did play chapter 1, and I thought it didn't make sense, and then people told me to just wait for the next chapters, and I'm like, okay well, fuck this then, I guess I'm waiting for the next chapters before I even touch it. Are we gonna accept the one I think so? Like I remember there was like, Horse Girl, and Horse Girl was like, I'm gonna eat your face, and I'm Dark and Evil, and I'm like, oh shit, this is, this is, okay, maybe there's like, something going on here, but then she was like, actually no, I'm just an edgy teenager. I like that game, that's kinda fucking lame, I thought there was something more to that. Am I misremembering it? Am I doing it wrong? Is this sort of the plan for this pool? Kind of. But yes, you understand the idea. So the way I want it to work is, you push the spool down, and then it all unfurls. Now we need to figure out a good way to make the spool pushable. I think I want to make it so that standing on the spool also pushes it. So let's allow the player to do that. So being a bad person meant to be superficial? See, I thought it wasn't superficial during chapter 1 at the beginning. Like, I thought there actually was something to it. The reality is, each chapter, some reveals might be better if you don't have to use predictum. I don't remember anything about Chris's mom, or anything like that. In fact, I am not even 100% sure who Chris is. I think that's the main character, but I wouldn't say that with confidence. So we get the angle to Mario. We need to project how far Mario is away on the X and Y axes. So let's do that. Since he is a bad person to begin with, but she learns a lot during the course of the whole game. Yeah, I get that that's the intention. I just thought it was lame the first time I played it. But I also learned that so poorly that I cannot say anything with confidence. That's so funny he made the whole thing in Game Maker. I'm not even sure if I'm going to play as a pacifist the first time I play Deltarune. Why are there fights in it? I don't remember. I will just do whatever the hell I feel like. And I think that's the optimal way to play the game. You guys are too into the theory bullshit stuff. Like, just play the game, bro. Turn your brain off, just play the game. So we go minus one. So we go to minus one and then forward goes to that. So that is not good because we need that here. But that instantly flips it around. Maybe this is better. That's not bad. That's not bad. Did I misspell forward well? I did. Did I misspell forward well, like, consistently all the time? What the hell? Nope, just there. The game of Deltarune is just a play. I mean, watching TV is a game without tactical choices. It is a video, because you watch a video. And it is arguably a game, because you press buttons on your remote. Alright, let's listen to it, Lila. Okay, so that seems to work. Okay, let's listen to it, Lila. OBJ move left ground doesn't seem to ever go off. Oh, well, it's simply... You're taking too long, what do you mean? Oh, well, it's simply... I guess I guessed. I guess I guessed. So standing on this side shouldn't do anything. That's good. A few issues. Why would it do this? That's weird, it shouldn't be doing that. Unless accumulated distance was some weird fucking value. What do you mean, Lila? Happy birthday? What? What's going on? What do I not know? I'm too long? That's what she said? Okay, Lila, I genuinely have no idea what your issue is right now. Oh, you were making Deltarune jokes? I see. I thought you were just, like, heckling me for some reason. What the hell? Okay, so multiplying the velocity by 0.2 doesn't work, and it's also a terrible idea. Okay. Let's see how this works out. Okay. It just stops updating. Oh, wait, just checking. This is supposed to appear. Ah, haha. Okay, guys, I think we have something cool now. So we're obviously still gonna wrap rope around the pole and around this wall. Okay, it's getting there. It is getting there. Okay, almost, almost. How cool is that? And then... Oops. The pole shouldn't be there before we do this. Oh, hoo hoo hoo. So close. Might have to reduce the bounciness of this bullet a little bit to make this work. Okay, that's still enough. Let's do that. I think this is now perfect. in the cutscene in the end, I think. Okay, we might need to align the spool a little better with the rope, but it definitely looks like it's unfurling. That is cool as hell. Yeah, definitely, we're gonna add a rope onto the spool. We just haven't done it yet. We're also gonna add a rope around here. How's F3 going? I actually haven't checked in a while. Let's see, how many submissions do we have? 19 responses, 19 submissions. Very nice. Whoa, and I'm seeing some insanely promising names in here. Okay, that's good. Anyway, I think I'm done for today. I have to go out with Zeyna to the barbecue. I was supposed to be picked up at 3.30. So I will be seeing you guys in the next stream. Hopefully we can finish the coil that time. Till then, bye bye.
