You you hello hello Nahuel Pailapi, hello Zomluis yeah my microphone was muted I guess I was stuck in recording mode whoops just too much sound no there isn't this the perfect amount of sound now hello Kian today we will hopefully animate some of these NPCs here like that guy and the piano guy and things like that hello minus mario so far I'm going pretty well I have been working on a level that I was not supposed to show yet for a little bit of a collaboration project and it's looking really good but you're gonna have to wait until you see it hello Biobak are you a marketing manager now that's the exact type of test text that like a woman that works in advertising would send you I'm replacing it with 2.6 but I sucked up since yeah we're using 1.6 if you download your ROMs from like only rom I guess you know but any romaker you don't know might just put a virus in there collab level in the sec kind of basically there is a little bit of a call up I'm working on with Aeza and he's making a level and I'm making a level that will also be in the sec because I was planning a level anyway that so like we can just double cash in you know what I mean you know what I mean we just cash in twice did they the good old case strats we're like we just make the popular thing I can't show you what it is in DMs if you want Biobak but I'm not supposed to show it on stream yet let me let me grab the link for you in DMs and you tell me what you think you will let everyone in chat know if this is any good I'm gonna put my favorite song on real quick I fucking love this song it's gonna be a sub area in course 14 that I'm making your wife is absolute crap that sucks bro hope she gets better soon which is really cool oh yeah and I'm working on the gameplay too I think both the gameplay and the visuals will be very cool it's a song it's called polka dancing donkey so Zayna animated this guy here dude the Rhybons guy will be so happy this is when Rhybons dies yep that works I'm gonna keep the style of the original Amara Desert I think the original Amara Desert 64 is absolutely ugly yes fair point counterpoint you are forgetting that this is the retro stage so this is not gonna be like oh this is part of the game normally this is gonna be part of oh look at the retro game Mario Kart 64 isn't that a good old jolly time hello Skyloft that's a good idle I think that should be cyclic though oh yeah that's good okay I have a funny idea but I can't code so if you want to make it shit what is it I can't make two entries can I you got any tips to start lifting start lifting twice a week full body workouts and after six months then then you switch to like full body and not full body then you switch to push pull legs and you can do that maybe once a week or once every five days I currently do that once every four days oh that's also a good animation did didi dance from tick-tock so I'm saying heck that's just PowerPoint slides explaining why you should vote 10 you should suggest to someone 2639 on SoundCloud that's something he would do this one needs a fake user before it disappears forever how she made two walks oh this is kind of like a zombie walk I think I prefer the normal walk here so Brian what did you eat where the fuck do you care what I eat the fuck who cares what other people eat that's so insane to me why do people talk about their food dude no one gives a fuck any OST wishes today or do we just listen to the poke and then think donkey all stream he met cuz he hasn't eat false okay they still look fun that's the most aggressive way I've ever seen anyone answer I can do worse pretty well though I see it that's a good one no I'm so confused so I'm sure I can't tell you what I ate but like do you know these streamers that just sit there for three hours and yap about nothing that anyone would care about talking what you ate feels so incredibly narcissistic to me it's like who gives a shit you think you're that special that anyone cares what you ate the fuck and how parasocial do you have to be to actually care yeah ping is running yeah I mean I can't hate on the grinds but like I can't handle the person they're just farming parasocials right oh we're missing one animation here where he just kind of lost also this animation here is a bit showing me something like this kinda I think that's a bit too extreme this LST is a banger oh there we go that's good switch starting a little too late wasn't dream like wasn't it confirmed that he wasn't actually the things people accuse him of case and you know what causes the game to have so many performance issues yeah it's just program pooling it is what it is I said what I said did you fix new fpdx in your code no it is still too slow on my end I don't know if it's my fault or fpdx's fault we'll have to debug it another day with Sauron how the level's done just watch and learn I guess what are your thoughts on Mario Kart 64 I know you're in any way interested in the fact that Mario Kart 64 still comes at 90% I think Mario Kart 64 is really cool the problem with hacking a game like Mario Kart 64 is that Mario Kart double dash and Mario Kart Wii exists so there's two alternatives that are kind of just like superior games but Mario 64 there's something very unique about it and that is the physics the movement that no other game coming after it can replicate so Mario 64 is still kind of special in that sense Mario Kart 64 I just don't see it if I was hacking a Mario Kart game it would be Mario Kart Wii I think that's where Mario Kart does a series for me not really Skyloft I think Pokemon's just not for me anymore see with Pokemon I have the issue that there's two ways to play the game really the one is you just get your over level starter and you dash through well actually no the problem more like is the only resource you have is time right so I feel like I barely even get to like experience the game I feel like I'm just constantly extrinsically motivated to do things and there's like nothing intrinsic for me to do I just don't feel joy playing the game so much when I started going on probably not probably it's just average right it's just that it has a lot more stuff going on compared to other games but of course if you have that much stuff going on maybe you shouldn't because like your performance is gonna suffer do you mean let's get him so it's fun to be entirely innocent oh I see what do you mean with intrinsic motivations okay so there's sometimes things you do because you get rewarded for it and then there's things you do because you want to do that extrinsic motivation is if you get motivated to do it like your job you wouldn't say your job is like a fun game to play but you get rewarded for a lot playing Pokemon kind of feels like a job because you kind of just get the extrinsic motivation whereas if you play a game like um Tears of the Kingdom that's a very good example but it is of the kingdom and you build a machine it's a fucking waste of your time practically speaking but it's fun that's pure intrinsic motivation so when do we get to action equals two so and now we need to go to the run animation which is zero one two three the fucking 150 liter bottle of water catches me every time hey it's a good one we don't want negations that that they were about to dream to the police dream himself then as a police he wasn't reported and guess what they got nothing oh okay well it's all hearsay right there's nothing that we know that we can verify for all we know every single one of us might be living in a Truman show what if the entire world isn't real you wouldn't know what if we're all just faking it same about dream so i'm not giving it my hat now then that's like too much work hello james l i'm good conspiracy theory now it's just schizophrenia it's that meme up when the youtuber you've been hating for no reason finally does something questionable and you have a legitimate reason to hate him so so wow and we is aids to mod the tools suck monkey balls thing okay strong choice of words no one's welding and all the work you need is made for nothing and we're all just in a simulation well all the work you will ever do is for nothing unless you have like an intrinsic motivation to do it hello angie rough ah wrong level i wasn't supposed to show this no fuck he said nothing okay that looks a little bit too aggressive of a run oh that's fucking clean though so yeah 16 non-buff and unemployed what you should do your fucking homework so No problem today is a fun stream already. I'm liking this Congress Bradford a it's like Mozart's but for games because like Mozart was also obsessed with poop That's the only reason When games would you say provide good intrinsic motivations, I know demons on a person but still want to know One game that provides really good intrinsic motivation that I know of is Grand Theft Auto Because what do you do in that game? You don't actually do the missions. You just enter cheat codes and be a dick right So The walk animation, okay We need to speed up the animations with what you do And we need to make it so that if you can chase if you can chase right here He needs to go straight to animation to action, too without this So when I relive these glory days, oh god, what is this I Don't get it. Okay. I don't understand this When I feel a lot I was eight when last time it came out and now I'm gonna be 17 this year then. Oh 100 kinds on our I see I see Yeah, those hacks suck would never play them couldn't be me sucks to be you I Also feel like the start of the animation was too slow, you know what I mean? It's like he's falling in slow motion The back part is fun I Know the Sunny Beach Tower It was a creative idea at the time though, right you have to admit for 2011. That's like an interesting concept So, let's see what's up with the walk animation It kind of just looks like the run animation like this, I think I'm actually gonna pick the zombie animation here I'm saying I killed my chat one second I Never said the reason I'm using bad is they're too slow Interesting. Where are you noticing this phenomenon in my animations or just like a general thing on like other people's sex? But like I told you I wasn't just a lookers on how to quote for coconuts Let's just see if there's any hilarious your bad. God. They're almost guaranteed is I think out of all the video games released that are like the same size. It's like cotton collar mark 64 I don't think any of them actually hit like 70% of the frame rate that the hardware would have given them had they done everything, right? Oh This looks so good Wait, why is he still chasing me? Oh, I know why And most of the time when you think animation looks off it's because it's in slow motion somehow Honestly, what if this is because of Nope never mind. I'm wrong I Were 11 when the Yoshi's Alanek went to the room. No, you're 16 That's false. I think I didn't start development that early I Was inside the UFO, there's no UFO. Yes, cuz I mean, that's the goal He accelerates a little too slow I think And He sees me too quickly You should stop chasing me as soon as he stopped seeing me So, you know my two first companions walking speed but instead of slowing the feed down What if you had the sand but it's flying behind him? So it looks like he's slipping on the sand. Oh I see what you mean And I was actually gonna scale this animation speeds with his walking speeds because I feel like that makes sense What does the big egg do murder you Yeah, I usually scale animations with the walking speed it is the easiest thing to make good-looking I think I See about seven five acceleration seems fine to me This should maybe not decelerate so quickly maybe we should have 1.2 F here instead of 1.5 Can chase should also have a distance check And Let's give him like a 60 that's not 60 degrees dude. I Cannot convert that degrees. It's fucking 0x6 000. Have fun with that. Oh Whoops I Don't use radiance. Why would I use radiance? The heck Do we not compute the angle tomorrow we don't It was just such a static number that's why Hello hedgehog gamer He Stops his pursuit a little too quickly here. So instead of exclamation mark and chase is should be like I So he will remember that Mario is here, but he will not see him if he's behind First you know math. Yeah, but it's not faster It makes it seem like he's a zombie could dry bones maybe be kind of like a zombie It's a little bit the idea that he's kind of like a zombie There's one animation missing and that is when you bounce on him. He should just do a little bit of a loss Do I like music if yes, what is your favorite my favorite song right now is the polka dancing donkey I Okay, this vision looks a little bit too big and we still need to slow the animation to his actual walking speed I'm pretty sure they do hurt you a little bit when they hit you I need this check here and then we need This minus one plus F because we have 12.5 and we need that divided by By three actually, let's do this fuck it This should look good I I should still add step sounds to this. You love watching. Dr. Phil interesting. I Pronounce it whatever sounds better in a moment something something It's fucking hilarious do it It's maybe a bit too fast, but it's hilarious Maybe I should slow it down a little bit more I kind of like how it looks though. What do you think? I think just a little bit slower slower not like a lot slower Yeah, of course it's too fast but like not a lot too fast Yeah like that I Sorry, there's something I saw and if you donate money, otherwise, nope, I think the out-of-range check should also be higher And considering they now use line of sight I think we can use this slightly Do you say we're switching power launcher? I would never switch to power launcher. It doesn't work for me Knowing it's a clickety-clack true. Oh You spend points yes, yes, of course, of course if you spend points, I'll listen to your song. Sorry, of course The thing is I'm using restream chat now, so I don't have to twitch chat open Which means if you use any twitch reward, I can't see it So Unfortunately, I missed that Here we didn't come check trust me Mm-hmm You requested the entire OST, all right, you know what I like Pokemon Platinum we can do it I Spend just on covering with your own. No with my controller Dude I think My VS code fixed itself. Oh my god, that one guy will be so happy about this Because suddenly I'm seeing all these recommendations from VS code you guys seeing that shit So an emission two and three need footstep sounds right an emission one and three I See the good things I have get done here. Yeah Once they see Mario they should have appeared when they are locked on and follow him to avoid surprise animation with the follow-up Yes. Yes. Yes what you saw just now was because I went in and out of the range So I made it so that the in range is much smaller than the out range So what you're just set could happen who can no longer happen Just So you are aware so we need animation frame 9 and animation frame 64 Let me check something oh I know I should not have done with the flex like one I Didn't cry and I'm flexed to other than that nothing What's this guy name again Barack or something he keeps saying that yeah, you know what I mean Oh Oops Okay, and animation one has somewhere oh wait I mix them up whoops What's that is at six And 36 Does that make sense the animation is 50 frames so it has to be a 31 Right and the other animation the run animation Is What's that 9 and 64 was it not Yeah, and this animation is 105 frame so they have to be 52 apart for to sound right, so let's just do 62 and 10 Should be good enough I'm doing your stuff for a while now. I think it's pretty cool I've been having a couple of your past streams as a background noise. Oh nice nice Hello, non plus no coup How the hell does me as Cody tram, I don't know Does it Know that someone just joined my house And I don't think we want the Goomba walk noise But we will listen to this anyway, just to make sure it's fine. I Have 9 and 64 Wait you come up with that Oh, there's a lot of noises, that's what's difficult. I don't like this. That's annoying me a little bit. Yes, I was not planning to use the Goomba walking sound here. Let's use the Koopa walk sound, because they are kind of Koopas, right? I'm wondering if maybe the tumbleweed shouldn't have a sound, because the tumbleweed has a really weird thing, where the yukiki step leaves. Okay, let's make this sound super low priority. Priority is the second last. Sound tumbleweed floor. Anyone can contribute ideas, right? True. Are there any sounds that are similar to the sounds of walking sounds from Koopas in TDYD? Oh, yeah, the Koopas. Will you be able to ride Yoshi? I don't actually know yet. Maybe I'll put the rideable Yoshi. I mean, I kind of should put the rideable Yoshi in, right? Wait, it's those barrels here. They are making the noise that mutes every other noise. World spawner, wild west barrel, sound journal box, landing. There we go. Wait, what does the second number mean? Play flex, play flex. Sound action tumbleweed step. Oh, we already have this. Okay, so I know it should make a new one for the barrel. Let's give this one a quick fall off. And lower priority. All right, that should do it as soon as we actually link this up. I have to return to stream. Hello, Zayna. Zayna, the Dry Bones look really, really good in-game. You will love them. Let me first make sure that the barrels are fine now. Look at it. It's really good. Oh, yeah, they're much better with sound quick fall off. Do you like man? Interesting, I do not. Somehow, there's just no sound at all when I walk. Let me try another here. Men are nice when they're not douche. Yeah, they make a noise at least. When did the Koopas not make a noise? Oh, I need to add this noise to the crumble action. That's 180, a good frame. Let's double check. That's 140. Isn't if use no coding? No. I mean, the Chucky idea, yes, that is cute. But I feel like it's not quite the Dry Bones style. And it's also going to be annoying to program. I have not tried this at all. Oh, we're missing this animation. That's why this looks so weird when I jump on him. I see. I see. I don't like that it's so quiet. Is it just because my game is so loud or is it actually that quiet? Let's put this one in and I'm going to turn the game up to full. And then we see what happens. I got the Everdrive X5 in hopes of being a proper one, but it's all bugged for me. Okay, so there is a Koopa walk sound, but it doesn't sound good. The reason I'm using Project 64, despite it being dangerous, is that it's only dangerous if you open someone else's ROM. And it's just the most convenient for me. It's not too deep. Yeah, I have no hope in the X7. I think I'm done with Everdrives. The X5 doesn't work for me. I'm not going to get another one. If anything, I'm getting the Chinese ripoff knockoff thing. My summer guns are from a store. No more group buys. Oh, did you make the store? Because what's his name? The sour OG told me that there was a store with them. And I almost bought it, but then I wasn't sure if it came pre-assembled or not. And I didn't want to have to assemble it myself and risk fucking it up. You're the creator. Someone else ordered like 200 units and sells them. Oh, I see. So they're making bank off of you. I see. I see. Yeah, no, I definitely want one. I think YouTube might delete it, but it should be fine on Twitch. But yeah, you're on Twitch, so it should all be fine. Oh, the scatterbug walk actually might work really well. Oh, right. I saw this before. But this is not where I can buy it, right? Because I don't want to build it myself. I don't know how to build it. Do you not sell them cargo? Because it feels like this is something you could make a lot of profit on. Considering how many people want one. Okay, so the walking works, but it still seems wrong. Did I mix up the walk and the run? Actually, I feel like I did. Maybe that's why it seems so wrong. Too much effort, too little money. I'll check the first link where to buy. Let's see. The farm store. Group buys available. Oh, yeah, this is the website I saw. It comes pre-assembled. Because this has confused me. Yes, ship pre-assembled is cheaper than PCB now and case later. When do you think the pre-assembled has the PCB case in there? Am I getting this wrong? Why is pre-assembled cheaper? I'll just double for shipping for a second option. Okay, but why would anyone ever want the second option? It seems silly. Okay, I think it works now. Yeah, it works. It's just that the sound is not good. So let's try the Koopa walking noise again. Koopa the quick walk. Is that a bigger one? I'll just double for shipping. Oh, there we go. Perfect. All right, now we're just gonna finish the last animation frame. Too many different people. They don't care if SC-Secret Games is a bare PCB without a case. Oh, I see. I see, I see. Okay, I was thinking of this from a much, much more casual consumer perspective. Of just like, oh, I want to play my N64 games on the thing. And I want to do it as easy as I can. Is the summer cart like the EverDrive where you can put anything on it? Or is this only for developers? I mean, I'll definitely get one. It will save me a lot of time. There's the menu, you can order the game. So it's just better than the EverDrive, right? It's cheaper and has more functionality and it will actually work. You should really sell these. I don't know what country you live in, but like... If it's just better than the EverDrive, why wouldn't everyone want one? The EverDrive is going to be a PlayRoms cart? No, the EverDrive is just going to be sold off. Zenfuse doesn't make cheats yet. Oh, I didn't even realize the EverDrive had cheats. So for the animation, I'm thinking of the BigDryBones animations. Where if you jump on them, let's see if this video shows it. Yeah, like that. Okay, let me just go frame by frame here. Okay, I see. So he first ducks down a little bit. Something like this. But we have an exact frame count we need for this and that is 16 frames. So let's just compress this a little bit. There we go. Works. Okay. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If only his mouth could open. Yeah, that would help. You still have my credit card, right, Zeina? I'll need that to buy the thing. I feel like the animation should be one frame more. Just have that one weird frame of rotation out of here. You have it? Oh. All right, I'll get the summer cut later today then Okay, I guess there was two frames of rotation and not one That was too fast in the room my room my room is the late 1990s theme Okay, I see this one frame too early And I'll actually use the animation frame to check this I Am good at matching the big dry bones behavior in the new Man, I'm good at such a specific thing I'm probably the world champion of matching the big dry bones behavior news for Mario Bros games What do you think? I Didn't decorate the room at all by the way, this is just how the room came How long does it take that I was a reassembly where's that line called It takes as long as the animation is which is around 200 frames He murdered me he would have murdered me if I wasn't cheating All right should be no collision yet, maybe I actually should make it a pushable collision there Yeah, let's make that a pushable collision and not a no collision I Can honestly just do And then in the crumble action That should do it What's the point of grabbing the hat though Wait I'm still setting the intention ability timer. I can't do that. Now. We should have it And There we go, all right, I think the dry bones is done looks good to me We still want to add the sound for him crumbling but that will be like At the end of development because for sound space things are a little bit weird. We got to do that at the end And unfortunately, the avatar doesn't quite work so it's yeah unlucky Well, they are not that difficult because they have to spot you first And they're also very easy to just take out All right with the dry bones done. Let's move on to the next enemy that Zayna has sent me Or actually, let's check out the piano guy first Okay, we're gonna have to change the name of this file Zayna shy voice not very descriptive So she wants this guy to be a piano player And he's gonna be in the in the saloon and gonna be playing piano Yeah, he looks pretty good doesn't he Let me check what all these materials are like our detector doesn't fit it's not good It seems good It's retro section done now, we're just having a little bit of an NPC programming stream When you made this whole face detector you only need half that All right, let's fix a few of these things Shit Biobak, what was the hotkey to do this again? Or what was the shorter way? There was one way to do it without pressing three things. I feel like you told me And I forgot what it was. I Mean the new one forgot to add it in half I see To Do what to unpack all the resources quickly, I feel like there was a quicker way to do that Wait Zayna it's not symmetrical Was it supposed to not be symmetrical I feel like it wasn't No idea you never do it what I feel like you told me a faster way to do it me or someone else And textures, okay I There it is Why is it mirrored like this something about this is really weird Do you think you would ever be interested in creating a dwindling come up? Yes, kind of I Fortunately, I have to kind of fuck up your texture quality here Okay, I see what the plan is here but I think we can cut this in half like so Oh, well, it feels like we only need a quarter of this texture The reason I want small attack justice because it saves a lot of memory and because it's like I Like that Could you end up on running sound effect when they run? Yeah, maybe The problem with making a windwaker map is that it's gonna be a lot of work to even get into it Not financially worth it unless someone pays me to work on that I Wonder if there's any up here Yes, there is we don't need these two here These two do a little bit but so little that I think we can live without them we just move these two up a little bit What kind of work do you think I would involve it most of it would be actually learning about what windwaker actors there are And how I can use them To make cool stuff This is kind of weird UV mapping wise, right You mind if I fix the UV map a little bit up I'm thinking this I Know for this this is fine the way it is But just because of how little difference it makes. Oh No the fucking oven turned on Oh Y'all thank you for the sub welcome Welcome to the crew I'm stupid ignore me There we go, it looks wrong here, but it's fine in-game trust Let's see doesn't make a map editor here going to look more into this now Yeah, this is about what I would expect it to be like See, okay The way I learned ocarina of time making what I did is I made a little desert map and then I placed every actor that Was possible to place into the level and I saw how they acted and every time there was an interesting thing that I saw That gave me like a creative idea for a puzzle I wrote it down into a text file and then at the end after I looked at every object I had a huge list of possible actors Add one list with like actors that are good puzzles And one list with actors that are bad puzzles that need to be built on first and then a list of actors that are easily Modifiable to make good puzzles and then I threw those together to actually make a decent game And I think that is the optimal way to do it Luckily power PC assembly is super easy. So with wind waker you can do that, too How the rig doesn't work I Yeah, there's some unweighted bones here Like I want us waiting this one here Nothing I Lisa looks like nothing Yeah, I'm getting these rigs right it's not easy especially the first time around Kind of looks like leafy is here if I just push that down so I can't do that I Think there's one with multiple weights arm arm to our oh That's not good I Caught a 3d mem size too big Thank you, it's just too many unique colors in boots What I didn't mean to make this a ci4 by the first 64 default to that Too many connecting vertices and triangle. Oh because this is so set to every D Dude they already had an FEDX free option. That's cool Hello, Hashi. Where's Lila? Lilaa is in prison, unfortunately Last I heard I was told she's in prison No one knows why maybe she will pop in chat and tell us where she is in prison That Is the wrong level Frosted leafy. I don't even remember really who leafy is. All I know is he has no chin Fuck I exported him to tick-tock clock The imprisoned yeah Lila's in prison We don't know why This is just the saddest the time Lilaa died Free Lilaa true free Lilaa Does anyone have TNT in this level? That's wild west. Yes Oh She downloaded Mario roms, oh no, why would she do that? What Did I what the hell Internet space file name or file name. It's exactly what you're getting I am very confused by this oh I deleted one apostrophe did you get project 64 1.6 from a YouTube video technically yes that was 12 years ago all right Zeina he is ready to be animated I think wait let me make sure yep he's ready to be animated I'll send him right off let me just save him under a proper name here here there you go how do you think is better than this is a world west from my courses or stick forces one would be Yoshi's next is another character that Zeina made and that is a Boshy this guy is very funny oh there's a lot of animations here that are not marked protected I better do that real quick before everything just dies oh my god how many animations does he have Zeina oh wait this is all the old Yoshi I see so you're gonna have a shootout with him and this is what happens when you shoot them cow Boshy true cow Boshy what purpose is he serving he's the person that you have a shootout with kick the case so she you get that Hashi did I love 12 years on the internet talk to Google no I'm talking to case anytime now he will love talking to me I'm sure if I just pass to him with 15 more questions he'll finally respond to me this time for sure 15 times the charm you know what they say did I love responding to stupid comments with like asking if they're an AI I think I'm just gonna start doing that whenever someone says something really stupid I'm just gonna ask them if they're an AI can I post a link to your secret design I think it would fit this level as well you can post one but there's no shots we can actually add it to this level but I'm still up for seeing it thank you for the sub Jinju yeah YouTube could be deleting your link I don't know if it will there is a chance cow Boshy you have me as a person you don't even know me you few watched a few streams maybe I'm complete asshole IRL maybe I am just pretending to be slight bit of an asshole on stream but in real life I'm like 10 times worse hello Holly why what you want to ask me something but you think it can't be offensive okay let me guess you wanna know if I'm autistic I am not the sand but one even has a water coin star all have fun with that Holly cases a serial killer is that where Lilaa went that is a good idea Hachi made a sky autoscroller thread coins three separate times and I'm gonna do it the fourth time actually I did do it a fourth time but this time it will be good for sure no must not go for no have you seen this costume from our car tour hit for the cowboy like pretty well kangaroo Rushi that is a funny design but this is so fucking weird this feels like one of those is not real right is this real chat is this real got Nintendo has become a mobile game company this game was AI generated looks like it that's fair Holly I honestly just wanted to make the bird see in 64 and I did make things because I thought it'd be good I made things because I wanted to see them it's literally it it's like the fake Mario mobile game with the voice lines I don't I'm not aware of this but that sounds very good I was here for the 6-1 I know you were trying to make a fun game no no no it's always been experimentation for me I definitely was emphasizing level design compared to lost impact that is true but it's still about experimentation for me 64 and was like I'm gonna make 32 linear games 32 linear levels to make sure that I'm good at making linear levels right I'm gonna learn as much from this as possible that's always my mindset I want to make something I always make it with the idea like I'm gonna learn from this and become even better when you're talking about it you already came up for ideas we're gonna try what do you mean by actors that's just objects you place down in the game that's what you call them like making the bathroom level obviously I knew like most people aren't gonna like this but I still wanted to see what I could do with the concept if clients can project six right yes yeah the bathroom level is just nothing special right it's a little bit boring same with like 8-3 the only real surprise for me was how bad people thought 2-1 was last time I was just kissing whatever and people still come after I'm reaching in a few percent is a loss in him true okay well she looks pretty good in game very spiky and edgy give him a hug dude he will be the edgiest boy ever he doesn't want the hug he wants to bring death to all who oppose him and steal candies from a baby which is fine by him this is like taking candy from a baby which is fine by me all right let's see what you have what the fuck honestly the voices are kind of on point like except for the rabbits the voices feel on point no but she isn't like that in the normal game well he's the cow Boshy how is Boshy in the real game isn't he also kind of like an asshole in the original Mario RPG then what is it claiming Boshy does steal candy from babies canonically but he turned someone else yet this guy will nice still but he's really edgy at first he doesn't want to be a farm Yoshi he ain't no traditional Yoshi they made the edgy Mario how about they not being taken down dude what was that about ruining brand image come on the others from racing in sperm are treated and have cookies to wage on the but he never spoke in a mean way so he's kind of a bully this one is more like angsty doesn't want to fit in more like a teenager you know kind of like the vibe you get from the second evolutions of the first three Pokemon this is shadow if he was at Mario true so he literally does take yes actually he does literally take candy from babies when you need them yeah I'm sure that lawyers are all in over their head with you so I see well I mean this guy is also gonna give up after that I think it's beaten he just kind of cries and he's like well maybe I should be a nicer person he's nice to do with the schedule of the train do the math I don't understand this is some kind of Auschwitz joke hey what else would be offensive and including trains don't be so vague he did a graphics when I showed him your levels and he was very impressed oh that's cool you are you I guess your dad's coming around on the n64 okay so idle wait for Mario to come by okay so we have this we have this guy here he's gonna be sitting on there and when you come by he's like who are you you jump you wanna you wanna have like a duel with me so challenge Mario to a duel then if you say no of course make fun of Mario for saying no and then explain the rules after explains the rules there will be a countdown that goes like three two one and then just like a random wait and then it says go and you have to press the B button and he also like shoots and whoever shoots first wins so this will be countdown I can count yes and then shots no more like shoot and then fingers first obviously there will be a victory speech we're gonna make it so every consequent loss makes them wait slightly longer so we're gonna make it so that every time you lose the game gets a little bit easier just to make sure everyone can beat it because reaction time is one of those fixed things where some people are gonna be in able to do this on the first try or ever actually if you make it to select 20 frames imagine you play on a garbage monitor with like 10 frames of input like the game would be impossible for you what are they shooting actually the Yoshi is gonna be shooting an egg and Mario's gonna be shooting like a cork gun like in Mario Kart victory speech cry lose apologize okay what happens afterwards after he's done he just sits on you or does he have an egg gun he just has the egg in his hand and he goes wink wink you know what I mean he goes yes who wants to fight so the question of where the egg came from is supposed to not even be on the what kind of apps they use to make games and stuff just watch the stream I think he needs it an extra animation of him just sitting on a rock while he drinks milk that would be funny but I I don't know hmm I feel like he should still be on the wagon and like aspire to be a better cowboy after that just like practice the shots Jesus man oh boy why he's aggressive today because there's one person in chat always asking me stupid questions it's like my number one thing that I cannot deal with if there's someone who earnestly has like a thing that he wants or like a question to ask but it's just because I can't even like be mean to that and like feel righteous about it you know what I mean I would be like an asshole so I just get upset that situation and I'm like I just want this to be over man get me out of here Zayna is right there Tanya why don't you be nice to Gungnir Chat is bullying me today they're all just calling me mean I'm gonna cry I just want to make video game what the fuck that's a hot key I didn't know excuse to bully me too true wretched would never call me mean thank you very much okay so when I woke up I had I had some protein shake and then I went and got some cereal and then I went and I got my protein shake and then I had some protein shake and then I went and got my protein shake and then I went and I got like you're lying to me which is why I will not believe it I'm not rooting I'm just tootin and then he farts okay that would be very funny but that's that's titid humor we don't want that what's the song in lost impact I know it was in Mario and the magic wand okay so Boshi asks for a duo hmm let's think about this text so we want him to be kind of like arrogance arrogant angsty edgy those are like the three keywords we want here and of course we want him to be kind of arrogant arrogant edgy those are the three keywords we want here and of course we want him to be kind of arrogant arrogant edgy those are the three keywords we want actually Hoshi that's an interesting theory hey jump what's the famous location on Yoshi's Island because I want him to be like I'm the fastest shooter west of blah blah blah because you know hmm it seems none of these places are named are they the same I don't actually know I usually had a dinosaur in the same place on the West hemisphere hello ask him I'm the fastest shooter in the West I feel like I should give Mario he how options as well what is yes and no and cowboy that would be very fun yeah partner it's too long not on your life nary a bit nary a bit I like that nary a bit pay further attention to in order to make the wild west level more authentic no case is so nice everyone true I am the nicest person translate this to cowboy I'm just using changing duty to make this more cowboy I'm actually definitely faster typing I have no idea howdy vermin I'm the quickest drawing to hold on West I'll show it true in the show don't you hear I like that anyone has bad ideas let me know the quickest draw on the West it sounds so good though this textbook is gonna be way too long the whole what the hell is it not getting the distance tomorrow that I do this wrong do I need to plop him on the ground hmm who's techno blade I've seen a marcella let me that Robert Rodney posted a few hours ago no but I know what he asked for lighting when you ask now I see okay so you've had this exact conversation techno blade yeah but I probably just deleted that info from my brain because it's just irrelevant to my life the magical cauldron it is silent right now and hopefully it won't be an issue next year and it's also not gonna be an issue in summer so maybe it will get less and less and we're soon done with it it's crazy we didn't beat cancer here it considering whales basically never get cancer and there's so many more cells you'd think we'd just be able to copy paste what they do right and then someone would make a DNA modification that would allow us to beat cancer and then they copyright the DNA modification and you're not allowed to breathe anymore without the permission of Walt Disney because that would be copyright infringement okay something dude I think that's a prediction that's not even a thought experiment all she this is my prediction you think Walt Disney will read me sounds kinky no I will say I'm saying he will have the copyrights to your children's body did I not hook up his behavior correctly as soon as we unfreeze them he will have those copyrights can retwist that it should be in the bottom left corner how is he never interesting action one you're on mobile oh that sucks for you Lilaa come geneticists are still stuck modding existing organisms instead of writing their own from scratch true they're stuck in the stone ages they should make new tools actually that's gonna be insane once they can just make them from scratch he says it's all good to you oh thank you chubby thank you for asking your uncle for me obj flag compute distance from our doesn't do anything right you'll unfound you eat on cables and as usual chew it on them oh that sucks wait are you the real Lilaa or are you like just another Lilaa with the same name as the real Lilaa do you even know who the real Lilaa is because that feels like something Lilaa would absolutely say how laser i'm modded idiot laser okay oh i see see i don't know that you're modded because i'm restreaming see like we all thought you were in prison so it's nice to see that they give you internet in prison even if it's just mobile on the wave power wave level it's already finished i just need to actually finish the game so you can play it okay you know what i'm just gonna debug print this the fuck is going on here no yabba richie why would you do this to me hey you're gonna come to my house and take my pc because who's stopping me from developing this on my own bm gamer i will forgive you if you can go on google and tell me the age of um shigeru miyamoto if you can figure out how to do that i will forgive you that is my only condition oh he does transition action states he just doesn't actually talk to mario born 1952 71 years old let's see if it's true okay okay yes he is right he i think we will forgive him no idea he was 71 let's print this action state i'm kind of scared that the ask mario function broke because that would break a lot of other functions as well you were born in 06 wait that's fucked up that could actually be true no i just modeled the egg oh what the fuck this is bizarre i stopped the entire world there is no known arbitrary code execution r64 but seems very likely to me that there one day hello sunny boy born to sunshine vs 64 well you are more like mario galaxy that's when you were born I'm not changing the entire level right before we are done the m70 1 0 7 1 0 what happens if I use this dialogue here yeah this time we're programming in C before that we did everything in assembly so if you think this looks complicated you should have seen what we did before that okay so it wasn't the dialogue cutscene or was it did I even that is not good at all surely it wouldn't be the rotate bit right what about other cutscenes well for me I think project 64 is the easiest to use 1.6 but obviously that's a risk if you are playing other people's roms lots of people swear on power launcher but the people are really fucking obnoxious but if you can get past that yeah power launcher is not that bad for most people and it doesn't work for me but if it works for you actually if you get lucky then go for it hello B-Turk dude B-Turk you will be so happy that somehow randomly my VS code started working I would say n64 for accuracy make some news then oh no what if you use talk to Mario instead was it the action arc it could have been the action arc let me try that one more time B-Turk thank you for the sub I would like to do Jojo but I don't know that I'll have time for it our power launcher users annoying they keep telling you to use parallel launcher regardless of what you say even if you tell them it literally doesn't fucking work on my computer they will tell you just go parallel launcher no it doesn't work shut up do you know how many times I've had that exact conversation and they just keep telling you use parallel launcher use parallel launcher it doesn't work I can't Lisa have you tried using parallelogram laundry yeah that seems like the mobile message it's your PC that's the issue it doesn't work on my PC so what do you want me to do buy a new PC I'm not buying a new PC just to use an emulator that takes longer to boot up hello scrotum we've been using snippets instead of writing the for loop shebang every time no you have successfully made me stop playing Mario 64 made me tell also made me because I first fucked up controller scheme it's literally just a gamecube controller on a Mayflash adapter I actually had DMS with the guy that develops para launch and he couldn't figure out what was wrong with my PC either marketplace is this for visual studio code or not what does even do do just type SST and it does this this one would be so fucking annoying the floor would be fine oh but this is the wrong floor you need to do a reverse follow most of the time that'd be a better preset yeah yeah but he couldn't figure that unfortunately yes I have never used snippets before I think so Nina but I don't know honestly even if it worked I wouldn't use it just because it takes longer to boot what specs do I have a big PC I have like a big graphics card for an engine development and a big CPU but I don't know which one all right now we need a text of him making fun of Mario for saying no but why do I need snippets be dark can you not just type it out it doesn't take that you can get a hard reset option which is faster than PGXE for boot time no why do I want that okay he needs to make fun of you and he will show you a ways like you you weakling you don't fight me you coward I wouldn't want to do me the figures something like that I don't know you look like you don't even own a hundred hectares I don't get it I'm backing up like the little coward you are yeah yeah what's the cowboy word for coward buzz off then I'll just translate this to cowboy skedaddling like a yellow-bellied cow what are you skedaddle what's the yellow belly thing I don't get it I don't get this one turning tail I like turning tail scaredy-rat the underbelly of a lizard the modding document yes epic legend and that's everything you need what would you do if a Yoshi told you to buzz off and this should be something like you have guts you've got guts but seemingly no brains all right listen here's the rules well shoot on go Well, draw and shoot on go did the cowboy dialog i very fun But it looks like your head is filled with tumbleweeds All right lend an ear we'll put iron and fire on go I'll tally down from free plant your boots Actually, I don't I don't like that Let's see how that works out So after this we'll just fade out the game and have him count down It's guts not guts What did I not spell guts that I even spell guts just now this is course 12 Hello sm64 Finn, I'm getting raided by Mario 64 the real Howdy vermin I'm the quickest at all in the whole darn West I'll show true in a show day Yeah up for it. Nari a bit Ha turning tail like a coward. Are you a buzz off then? Yeah Yeah, bet You've been great, but it looks like your hats filled with tumbleweeds Alright, listen up. We'll draw and shoot on go. I'll tally from re plant your boots This is a free liner Nari a bit. Will there be a German version? I don't know There's so much text on this game There's probably gonna be 500 dialogue box, which is three times as much as in vanilla Mario 64 I really feel like it has too much dialogue, I haven't played it too much though. It has 170 text boxes, a lot of them are even repeated 2 or 3 times. The way Mario 64 does their text is weird. They have the same signs in multiple places so that you will read the text at least once. Alright, this is if you say no to this challenge, right? Or is this when you just... This animation is great. Now that your fire has particles, does your particle count keep up with the second Bowser fight? Yes. That fire doesn't have particles, it's part of the fire object, the actor, so it doesn't matter. What does GameSpot's channel do? Nothing. Collect dust. Let's see the animations in-game. Is it impossible to remove the 8MB RAM requests from the expansion packages like Majora and Donkey Kong 64? That's a very difficult question. I don't know. I would have to understand the games a lot more to know. I believe it is technically possible, but it would be very, very expensive, time-consuming and difficult. Okay, I got the animations flipped around. I feel like there should be a third talking animation. Or maybe this should just be the normal animation here. Maybe that fits better. Donkey Kong 64 maybe uses the extra RAM for the vertex lighting. That's what I've heard too, but it sounds like bullshit to me. Because think about it, even if you have to double-buffer 256 vertices, that's 0x1000 bytes of data. That's like one texture. You would not require a fucking RAM expansion for 4MB of vertex data. It looks like he's doing the noblewoman's laugh, kind of. I think that's kind of a fitting comparison, yeah. Okay, so I'm pretty sure he uses F3DX. Donkey Kong 64? What does that have to do anything with it? I think it's fully bullshit. Yeah, but even if you have point lights, if you want vertex lighting, you can do that. Vertex lights or vertex colors rather you still need to do that on the CPU when do we get the chicken? what? what are you talking about? we get a chicken? chicken? is this the chicken? what is your job? i program games and i'm a professional video game player and use for breakfast professional means you are paid for it and by technicality i am a professional video game player just so you know hello Petra do you really be doing lighting on the CPU though? yeah they have to how else would they do it toilet noises? it's the oven and my chair the direct lighting code origin from Simon Kretik who is a guy on the programming team of DK64 right? is one of the devs yeah i mean there's a chance they just did it so inefficiently like there's a chance that they did the lighting by duplicating every single model in the game and then writing to one of the two model copies every time and that's how they double buffer it so if they did it in the stupidest way possible which is by duplicating every single thing in the entire game then sure it makes sense that they need eight megabytes for it kind of a bad reasoning though at that point you don't have to say yeah we needed it because we wanted the lighting at that point you have to say we needed it because we didn't want to program it correctly right also yes they could have just made their own microcode considering they kind of did that right did they do that one after the x2 or did nintendo make that one i have been pretty easy to do this in microcode you could just use the two flag bytes to like store the vertex color and then you would have the same thing much cheaper actually yes it would be much cheaper and without the actual ram where's the fade out i think it's somewhere in the oil rig um oil arm sure um y'all it's just your rotation around the up axis so a satellite dish where do you see a satellite dish i don't see it um so it's not a safe state glitch it's something many emulators do on purpose and yes it will light making or real-time lighting what I made a really cool lighting effect yesterday that I can't show you guys maybe one day you will be able to see it so super said to cd are you trolling instead of real super set he's trolling on a scale of one to ten we do it with two three hmm yes it works but it looks bad okay so you actually donated oh shit then thank you for the donation and yes bro is doing this for free see okay look this is what it showed like in my chat it just said as if you just typed it i thought you just typed it in it's funny can i pay you to watch me you're being paid an exposure or something paid an exposure to me so i mean before it runs out pokemon diamond pearl and platinum full ost  fine i'll look at it and doesn't say anything wait wait wait 146 is win at the slots or a game corner it's one of those two so i actually have no idea if i would get in trouble with nintendo oh wait hey i did a stupid  it should be like this now we should have it right but it's gonna be like if it was a later rn64 game i feel like it would be less memorable i feel like it being so weird it's part of the charm so so oh is he gonna do like a race or something i'm gonna do it like um an actual shootout and you add the 64 dd support isn't it automatically gonna also be running on the 64 dd just kind of shittier because the streaming is gonna be slower you'll be able to play this on the 64 dd just fine just with longer loading times and probably the music will be slightly corrupted because the loading time is so long so you'd have to make a really low res texture for that yeah they're having the duel game where people are just standing in front of each other and whoever shoots first wins so you want me to make even more content will i ever be free  act automatical okay let me just see that this probably disables morris controls now and then we're all good now yoshi's gonna throw an egg at you and you're gonna just shoot a cork at him what can you do other than more content with the 64 dd i kind of wanted this scene here you know i feel like this would work really well when we edit when the extra space and a bit higher quality stuff what's strange you have to do with the 64 dd 64 dd doesn't help in adding luigi at all so okay i think i want the camera like this though so this is slightly too far chop the cartridge game in half so that you don't have to compress it so much then you could put the other half of the game on the 64 dd disc how does that help why would i want to compress it less to decrease loading times well just being on the 64 dd is going increase the loading time again so now it's just the worst game still not quite there hey with project 64 you could theoretically probably just read the mouse movement somehow higher quality assets but the assets are not low quality because we have less storage space they are low quality because the n64 struggles to render anything high quality than this so more space doesn't help yeah it doesn't help with anything we could do more stream music i guess but i think stream music wouldn't really work on the 64 dd just a longer loading time we're taking advantage of the hardware we have we could maybe use like compressed music and like load it from ram then that could kind of work but then we'd have to be a lot more efficient with ram either way this is where we're gonna have to duel i'm thinking maybe zoom the camera in a little bit more move the camera up a little bit more something like this let me just get the shot right and then then we're all good so oh this song is kind of a banger i am using cash right well yes you have no idea how much i am using cash i don't think there has been a game on the n64 that uses cash as well as this one i stole a lot of google images that's how i got it  how much slow is ram uh infinite because you're not limited by your code speed you're limited by your renderer speed so if cash is free for memory traffic then using memory is not free and anything well i guess you can't divide by zero but you get the idea so this is hexam64 no hexam64's frame rate is way lower than this it must be like at least 30% lower at this point because they don't copy all the optimizations and the people working on hexam64 will tell you that's wrong but every time we've compared it's been like that so it's because they wanna not have all the optimizations because some of them make adding features more difficult or they think it makes it more difficult to work with but actually i think it's just they don't want to port it back because it would be a lot of work which yeah i get that i wouldn't want to port it back either which is why i don't otherwise i would have ported it back to the repo yeah i mean when i started this project it was normal to just like download decomp and like work on it i wouldn't want to work off heka even if i didn't have this repo because they make so many random changes to mario 64 that i just don't want in the repo i think like i would prefer being familiar with everything so it's the same as true so what is the newbie noob thing you're doing i'm making the camera right so that when we have to shoot out with yoshi it's gonna look good and i think this is perfect it's high noon all right i think we're finally done for the day i will see you guys in the next stream next saturday until then bye bye
