Hello, can you hear me now? Something really weird happened to my audio settings. I think yeah, you can't hear my music either There we go, I Poop eat my team. Oh, no, don't do that. That's fucking disgusting. You are in degenerate That's unsanitary Very unsanitary. I Have no respect for adults pooping their pants, I'm sorry Hello Sonic the Hedgehog You got caught okay, if I call you a degenerate just now that means you shit your pants I Think that's on you So I wasn't working on this you have a little bit of an intricate scene What do you guys think I I Think all that's missing right now for the boss fight is the grills animating And was a joke you literally just on stream admitted that you shit your pants You can't back out of that one, dude So I think I wanted more coins in this area because this boss is a bit too hard right now, especially once we add these things going down I Mean he's 10 weeks old. No, he's clearly talking English to me Yeah, I'm planning the platforms to sometimes move down here You guys think it's good I I Think we only have a few minutes to work on a boss fight today because biomech might join any second and be like case we're gonna start selects I Think maybe you should change the title of the stream to a Biomech does some reworking. No, it's working on you all of our question mark. No easier I Well, good thing the title has a question mark in there, oh, yeah, we need an OST Let's do a Zelda OST maybe Wind Waker When we go ST, all right I Metric prime. All right, it's metric prime. Let's do that one Right, I think it was sailor Cheryl then asked about metroid Something what helped me that looks incomplete maybe add a ring of like yellow or blue to it I don't know. I'm showing the paint program. Yeah, this is a complete redesign custom meet Taylor meet You wanted the cutscene to change Okay, let me show you the cutscene again, and then you guys can let me Let me know what you think about this So this cutscene is gonna happen after the block eats Mario and he spits him back out and it's gonna fade in from purple Right Here you're gonna see all the people in their cages You're like, oh, that's what I went And then you see the block up here and now you're here. I think that's a pretty cool intro. I Think it's good the way it is And Then you just start beating him Well that kind of sucked we still need to work a little bit on that part The block should spit out Mario after emerging Yeah, you know what maybe after he comes out of here we just have an animation of him spitting out Mario and Mario goes and lands over here I Think I'll do that. That is a good call And Spin part Mario go Wow and Mario lands on the opposite end Okay Let's look at bio bags other star selects. I think there's two more and some of them are a lot of work actually Sonic did say what 30 times? Oh Yeah Okay, good start and get started that they did there that did the day I think this is it I Know this song isn't this a brawl it is Oh We're going back to the star select screen, yep You know it is oh, yeah, we're gonna work on a really cool boss fight. Nope. We're working on something even cooler Maybe I'm a practicing motor. Have you tried old tool? If you tried eating cyanide I Joke it's it's a joke a joke Very funny joke, ha ha ha ha, okay Dude I can't see fucking shit. What is going on? There we go Ah 16,000 coordinates once again. I Mean it should be fine 16,000 is maybe a bit much wait. Ah, it's not 16,000. There we go Yeah Yeah, it's a lot easier to argue with without fuck preview, okay, this looks very very cool Let's make sure the combiners are in order this time Oh, he said the combiner this time He said the combiners I Think I removed all nth colors. Oh Nice that too Yeah, if and there's an issue with nth color we would notice this at the end oh never mind it's not removed here But it's an easy fix Do you bake in green colors on your textures or do you make the engine green gradients on them? Neither I use a vertex colors I Should which course is this? You know what? We're just gonna go by the order in which we created them It was course to a long time ago So my 10,000 triangles video, yeah, what did you guys think of the new video? This one's doing numbers. I Did look at this shit, oh My god, this is like twice as good as my second best video of the last 10 excluding f3 That's insane, man This video got more views in like not even two hours than most videos get like a day I Think more quickly. There's just it's like like and make it But that is not how anything I do works And Insulting the views of it is very important Unironically true who and then in the video you actually agree with the viewers opinion Oh I didn't see if the Fox I think it's all good You know what setting fuck on every single one of these it's kind of bad performance wise but it doesn't matter Oh shit, one of these materials is too big. Oh You used to I ate this is gonna look a little crunchy on the n64 and then it does here Should be fine This one can probably be an i8 now Material zero zero two. This looks like it's an i8. Oh This one's gonna look better than you thought nice Why Is it this time with a question mark well because apparently we are not working on the all-black boss You like the video that's good. That's good. I have a video coming up soon about the fast and the square root algorithm Oh That's our internet provider and that's the you know running into the thing What our internet provider just called and hung up I Ring tones been dog sung for a while Why not my text notification tone for a long time was flyways left But then I was demanded to change it because it kept scaring people I Was tempted to change it back Why didn't you change the title to what you're doing I thought this was funnier Does NC value per vertex cap vertex class per actual vertex or per triangle corner per vertex So if you have two vertices with the same Color you can actually fuse them and you can draw two triangles out of just like five vertices I Think started working on everything but the all-black boss at this point I could and it would probably be more accurate Wait render see to act select. Oh This is gonna be confusing Don't like this one. Oh, well, it is what it is So, I think Which level is this now? It's definitely not worms fortress Which level did we move this to HMC? Nope SSL. No, that's that's the other one No, what the hell What Course is this It is worms fortress Which Course numbers was fortress like eight You know what I'm just gonna go there and see what Chris number that says Yeah, we're moving tomorrow Oh Which course number is this course nine All right. Oh, of course That makes sense This monkey is not symmetrical at all His arms are very different from one another Huh, that's Mario 64, but are they different? Um the left? Oh, yeah, it does look kind of different Left arm has a slight bend in the hand. What sounds some guy Five eight nine here Oh I tripped over my pot some guy That's the sound you heard. Yes, and I just ran into stuff She is goofy like that I Try not to be So there's a new hack coming out by going play soon. That's just Mario 64 with a shotgun. I think I should play that No, it's only a YouTube video that's like another million views banger for sure It's Not an FPS it's just Mario with the shotgun from doom he can do cool trick shots with it and he programmed all the interactions I Was it still 16,000 I thought I was half that It should probably be a lot slower than the other one How big is the submarine also, we should absolutely put the submarine in the level instead of the shitty one of us right now Let's see how this looks Oh That is good, that is good to know okay, I don't need to animate it at all I can absolutely just animate to sine waves easily. Hello, Michi Michi Guys if you had to pick between Neil deGrasse Tyson and Michio Kaku, which one would you go with? This is not the fuck biomech wanted You'll pick Neil deGrasse Tyson. This is scarier, but not the same vibe. Yeah, it's just because it was using the wrong fork. I guess it's the first 64 bug or something. No, what is the new Goomba lore? I know that there are Toads that are turned into Goombas, right? I thought that is the official lore. Americans noticed by walking in a Goomba, it's because the Goomba bites him? Really? Okay, I think this is doing the thing that Biobank wants. I am going to do something forbidden. I'm sure this is outlawed by the official art federation. My dad BAM listens to 80s music. He BAM listens to it. My dad is inting his marriage, guys. Can't believe it. It's forbidden, I'm sure that you do it. Yes, it is possible to add TD for 6. That's a stupid question. Hello, Leela.  Okay, I'm making notes. Oh yeah, guys. Next stream is not going to be here anymore. Because we are moving tomorrow. And I have a week off next week. So maybe bonus streams, maybe not. I don't know, because we are going to be moving. But I am going to have my own dungeon. So the next stream is going to be in the case dungeon. I won't be on stream anymore. I will be in the chat from here on out. ChatZega will be back. This feels like a layer 6 thing. I think we'll probably do another house tour video. We can absolutely do a house tour, if you guys want it. Okay. Hashtag free Kaze from the dungeon. Kaze, hashtag leave me alone. I just want to work. Oh, shit. Your chicken just boiled, your highness. Listen, Biomag, I got a proper kitchen. I'm making the best meals on the planet now. Okay, I see there's an issue here. And maybe that's my Biomag.   The way it is. Shit. Maybe this does need to be a layer 4. It's kind of poopy. This one should not be foggy. I've actually seen Runmic being made before. Who better to see it from than Master True. Dude, I really like this new sub. We got to put that in the level. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  It's a little less than the previous one, but also actually looks like a real object. Yeah, it doesn't matter. The level that the sub is in runs 60 FPS on 964 pretty much consistently. We can actually go sicko mode on that level, if you want. We can add so much shit. We can add so... Dude, we need to add so many fishes to that level. Just fishes swimming around. Maybe jellyfish in the background. There's so much shit we can do. Okay. We cannot have a fanboy character, no. Okay, this is an interesting transform. Hmm. So next we're going to add a VRV framebuffer effect. That's a really cheap effect to do, actually. The problem is, it doesn't work on the emulator. And it will look low-res as fuck on the emulators that it does work on. Hmm. We need fanboy characters. No. I feel like fanboy is too much sexual implications to actually be put into this level. You can have a feminine looking male character, sure. But it's not going to be like a fanboy or whatever. Hmm. I would not want him to be referred to as a fanboy, because that seems like a sexual thing. Wait, did you say Y and Z rotation by your back? Oh, the position is a sine wave. And the pitch, no, the roll is a sine wave. Is it supposed to always be the same? I think it actually looks very harmonic and good with it all being the same. Let's think about this. How long is this? Let me count, like, 10 seconds, how many times it goes up and down. One. Two. Three.   Six. So maybe 1.5 seconds. So, like, 40-ish frames. I think 40 frames is fine, or like 45 frames. Max speed seems to be like 20, maybe. Okay. I think it's something like this, if I analysed this correctly. Can you recommend anything on vertex blending? I've just found out about it, like, two years ago. Damn, so you basically just found out about it yesterday, two years ago. That's like no time at all to research it. Man, I don't know. You're basically new to this concept. I don't know what I could tell you possibly about it. Days of yourself. Basically, vertex colours multiply the colour in your vertex with the colour that you put into the vertex most of the time. I'm German? Really? You're German? What? What? I think it was hiding behind the camera. You can sense the tiniest hint of an accent if you listen closely. True. Where the fuck is my submarine? Am I losing it? Why is my submarine not here? Where was the minecart? Let's start with that. Minus 5000. That's not that far away. It must have been too high, right? Oh, it is too high. Okay. Now it should fly through the screen once. Who's the best girl in Donkey Donkey Mario 64? I'm not sure. I haven't decided. Who's the best girl in Donkey Donkey Mario 64? Ah, Zeyna. Yeah, Zeyna played the game too. Zeyna, who do you think? Who the best girl is? In Donkey Donkey Mario 64. Oh. You would say none because you prefer man. Dude, have I news for you. There is a man in Donkey Donkey Mario 64. That you can romance. Do I have to pick a favorite? Yes. Do I really gotta? Yes. But they're all terrible. Okay, so it's been worked for that long. You didn't know? The whole game of Donkey Donkey Mario 64 is just offensive and stupid, though. I think I'm still slightly traumatized from the weeb toad. I think maybe the weeb toad because it was so traumatizing that I... That's the only character I can remember. Fair. Wasn't the chain chomp also in the lore? The chain chomp was all about warring you. You know, I think that could give me a run for the toad's money. No, seriously, who made the dialogue for that toad? I will not disclose. I will protect their identity. Haha. Insane character to go from the freak that I like to game romance. Wait, who do you think it was, Leela? Was it inspired by someone in your discord? No, none of the characters were inspired by anyone except for the pink bob-omb. It was inspired by Skellux. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why was the pink bob-omb inspired by Skellux? If you remember anything about it, you would know. Is there some lore about that? Am I missing here? Context? What's the context behind this? You're not going to tell me, are you? No. Man. Yeah, I'm going to shine you on this one. Where's the Skellux lore? Nothing will be disclosed. Man. The next course will be a Wild West level. It's going to be about catching evildoers. You're old enough to eat it on Roblox. Nowhere else. Why is my submarine not showing up? What the hell? Huh? Huh? The values here just all changed. Oh wait, did I get... I mixed up Z and Y again. No way. Oh, actually no, I did not. Okay. A Vector Restructance out of an Array? It's literally the same thing, it doesn't help at all. Dude, I found such a big improvement yesterday. Like easily 100 microseconds by just moving two lines of code. Yeah, this seems centered around zero. What the hell? How? How, how, how? Maybe it's one of these here. Maybe I did something wrong here. Christmas case? A music-based level? I was not thinking of a music-based level. It's right where it should be, isn't it? So it was somewhere here. How did I mess this up? How is this wrong? It just isn't. I refuse. Tons of wheeze? No. It's not starting with a music-based level. Okay, yeah. Huh? Okay, but the last four level themes are not set in stone. Enthusiastic about the Wild West level. I think it would be super cool Music level sounds like shit. I don't actually like that idea. Casino level sounds like it could work But I'm not a hundred percent certain on it and the comic based level. I think could be very good The computer suddenly misunderstood your code. I think it actually did How Can a sine wave do that? It can't That's just not what sine waves do I I'm not making a minus world inspired level Space themed and Bowser's last level is probably gonna be space themed. So I don't want the whole course dedicated to it But yeah, instead of the music level if you guys have any other ideas that you think are better Let me know because we might actually just do those Math themed level. Nope I What are you thinking with the comic level I'm not sure what you think about it I Was thinking there'd be like a huge City and you'd be like a superhero and you would like to save the city and there would be big skyscraper buildings that you would platform between I Don't know how well it would work  Yes, that's actually one of the ideas some guy but we hate that idea Desert island kind of level. Hmm They are already pretty deserted level. It's like all alone bubble dome We don't even have a snow level You're right. I was thinking of like an Arctic level that's like Full of ice cream and like we have a train the choo-choo train I think would be pretty cool Let's see if this is any better We set for each stage Something is clearly going very very wrong here a Sonic level We're not just gonna rip off sonic as a level I'm not even a sonic fan. Like why would I do that? I Would be actually 11 and this would be 12 still this thing doesn't even work Cuz you know an ice cream I would be ripping I've lost them back true Actually think I want 10 and 11 here You know what, this is actually impractical fuck this Hmm what could possibly cause our sine wave to do this? I Know that that's not a big number. So it shouldn't let me actually just make sure it's actually this time I Could do mall arcade level. I think that's kind of very close to the casino level, right? I Want to just see how this looks now Huh, are we all seeing the same thing? What the hell what is that I have never seen anything like that. Oh Hey, I Know why Oh Also, this wasn't being cast to a 16 because it didn't have the function signature Hmm This is like maybe 4,000 I think Well now these things make a lot more sense Sandwich is way too large. Maybe no, it was a stupid compiler issues. Don't worry about it Huh It's still being goofy how so a Spooky graveyard level We already have a spooky level, I don't think I want to spooky levels We got a new list of levels plans. That's public. I really like how this is looking. Nope That might also be an issue of the time we're not increasing as it should Let's try to increase our own timer here and use that one instead Now the multiplier is not too big the multipliers exactly made so that's like one sine wave rotation I That is what what happened by a mic The mansion level we already have the spooky ghost ship Which is very similar to BBH and then we also have a ghost house in Cooper with Carnival And not not Cooper with Carnival just Cooper Carnival I don't understand. I have castles to float, right? These brackets are starting to make things a little bit hard Hmm Hmm put the input into a six-mile and try to print I I Do cast on a 16 here, but you know what fine I Mean that makes it more readable anyway, so that that's a good thing, right? I Surely this one brother I Literally how fine I'll print  The sign input is working exactly like it should It's Maybe going a bit fast, but other than that But oh, yeah, it's going twice as fast as it should because this is updating at 90 FPS 60 FPS and a 30 Reduce the multiply it's a hundred hundred units should be completely fine How can a hundred units not be fine I Need an explanation for this I need an explanation for why a hundred units would not be fine You know what nope, it's not here I Have a bad idea no still How's it gonna be like even if it works now? How's it at the satisfactory conclusion? You can't just be like, oh it works good enough. You have to be like why the fuck is it not doing what I expect? to do Yeah, I see There's something else touching this for sure Wait, how Did I not change this to a one whoops, I thought I'd change that to a one fine Then debug yeah, that would be the next step if I can't think of the solution I just don't want to pull out the debugger if I can prevent that Hey that actually reduced it a lot how can this be? How a sine output is definitely between zero and one It's also spinning so much It's not very close to the camera it's 500 units tall and moving it up and down by up to one unit Oh This is exactly how I wanted I believe you I Wonder if maybe it's something with the interpolation code because this is updating at 90 FPS It's also only positive values here It's like it's not a full sine wave this doesn't look like a sine wave at all to me How's this a sine wave No, there's clearly something wrong with the sine function I Am gonna use the new sine function instead We Must be getting garbage values from somewhere. Maybe it's because this can reference the object stuff properly Yeah, that's much more reasonable for the values we've entered If you played Mario Wonder, nope Okay, this is definitely not what you wanted, right Still I think the reason that it didn't do this correct is because This is not including Matthew at all Some other compiler just didn't give me a warning about that Let me make sure that that's actually the reason I Put this in a paste bin I Think it will just work now if I add Matthew to back to the top I think what happened is that the compiler just linked garbage data somehow What the fuck how can it just link garbage data and not tell me What even did it link Because I would did not include the sine function needed for this and it still compiled the sine function somehow out of nothing Okay, this is clearly not the animation that fire back once Your Waves are the same speed biomech. What did you mean by one of them is slowed down by 0.5? Did you maybe mean that one of them was offset by 0.5? Hello Benjamin Schmuck, we're doing pretty good. Well, this isn't an offset of 0.5, but I think this might be what you want. Oh, hello Benjamin. Yeah, that looks more like it. I think we should make it maybe a bit faster. And of course we should reduce the roll. Actually, I think the reason it looks slow is because this movement is not enough. And the face is offset by 0.25 now. Ah, that's unlucky, but nothing we can do about that. Yeah, that looks like his animation. Just a bit slower, I think. Let me sync them up here. Yeah, his animation is faster. Where are the lights? Not in the level yet. I do like this now. Now we just need to add the lights. Will the teleport be removed when the hack releases? Which teleport? A bit too wobbly. I can easily reduce it. I guess we can slightly reduce the wobble on this one too. The one you have to float to. The entire overworld will be reworked, so nothing you see in the overworld is going to be the same. There was actually an idea yesterday. We were playing Mario Party. And I'm thinking we should theme the island for the overworld like this. You know, tropical island. I think it's a very cute design that works perfectly for our game. Make it nice and tropical. We can even add sunsets in it. Fast travel on a boat? It's just one island. Let's do that. This on layer 5. I feel like this will look weird, but we can try. How much layer? 5. I have to render that first. No. Actually, the rendering of this is going to be a bit weird, isn't it? Let me just try to render this right here. You're on the other side, but I don't want to waste your time spending a minute or two to get back to the main part. Oh, we don't even know what the layout is going to be like. If anything that big is going to exist and stuff like that. I've seen buffer. Lila, no. Stop. What problem are you trying to solve? That's the first question you should ask yourself. What's the problem even? The problem of rendering order. Why is the rendering order an issue? You like my squeaky chair? And I don't even know if you're right yet. I just don't know what the problem is. If they're not, I would somehow hide the lights, but that won't happen. I think I would hide the bottom of the lights. Are the lights there? I feel like they're there, but they're so opaque that I can't see them. 0.3. Yeah, no wonder. Fast 64 does not preview opaqueness very well. I know this sounds weird, but I don't know if it's a good idea. No, I doubt it. It's not even based off of a Cooper. This is too bright for sure. It also looks very color bendy. The color bending on this is way too much. Wait, I can't see shit here. I actually can't fucking see shit. Oh, I know why, because of the submarine. Okay, so this is what it's supposed to look like. And this is what it actually looks like. Yeah, the color bending on this is for sure the big trouble. I see, I see, I see. Yeah, Biomeg, are you still here? There's a better way to do this. You use the texture that is both an alpha channel and the color channel, but you can actually use the whiteness of your texture as an alpha channel. So if I find one of my nice, nice textures here, something like this, I can use the whole thing as an alpha channel. Okay. Like that. This will be a lot smoother in game. What's your biggest flex? That depends on who I'm talking to. Different people value different things, so everyone has like their own unique flex, you know. You gotta flex to people with what they want. This is kind of weird, is it not? Oh, you use vertex alpha? No, you're not. Oh, you use vertex color on that, I see. Interesting. Hmm. They should not shake around, because they're static things you're looking at. That should be a bit more blurred. That should be a bit more blurred. That should be a bit more blurred. Sure. Very easily. I see. Oh, now I know the effect you're going for, yes. I see, that makes sense. You want me to bob it left and right just like a tiny bit, maybe?  I think this could look good. It will look like there's a little bit of turbulence here. Oh, yeah.  Something's wrong with the textures, though. It's not bending, it's the edge of the texture here that's wrong. It's not the perfect colors, you know. Actually... Maybe. But I noticed one issue with the texture. You don't see it right now, but... Okay, never mind, I'm crazy. It is the vertex colors. Fuck. Use prim color instead? No! That doesn't help anything. No! What does that help, Lila? I'm in pain. Why would you suggest that? Yeah, you can see the color bending even here in the blend file. If you get the right angle, like here. Oh, I'm not color bending the other thing. There's also the fact that the middle part here is way too bright. It looks weird. I don't like it. She suggested using primitive color instead of vertex color. Which makes no sense to me. What does that help? There's just more data. The combiner math will come out to the exact same number. But yeah, you can see it here and here. I think we need to change the circles a little bit. Is it okay if I move them apart a little bit, Biomech? I hope so. Like they shouldn't overlap each other that much. Maybe like this? I think that still looks very pretty. And it doesn't have the same issue. It works, in my opinion. Hmm. The oil-blanked boss will never get done. You cannot force me. It looks a bit weird like that. Hmm. We might have to use lights that fade out closer to the edge. Like this. And then we can move them apart a bit. Actually, this might already work. Hmm. I think that's a lot better already. That looks good. Mm-hmm. I do like it. Very ominous and in the distance. Are the lights supposed to be bent? Yeah. Wow, that's cool. It's a shame they have the X on them. Yeah. Let me see what I can do about that. I think it's this texture here. Why is there an X on them? I don't see the X here. That's probably not the texture then. No, that is the texture. Is it? Yes. I just applied it. Hmm. We can also just blur this. Try this. They still can and do have an axe. I think that might just be a rendire, I don't know. It's the shading on the vertices, ooooh. What the fuck? That's definitely a bug I have to fix one day. Okay yeah, that is the shading on the vertices. I thought maybe that's on purpose then. But how can this be the shading on the vertices? Oh I see, I see. Can we just fix that like this? This does not seem like a good idea, unless... I got rid of the axe. You think it's better like this? I think it is. Let me just apply this everywhere. Hello, snap to the thing. I shaded black, but if you don't shade them black, then it just looks like a blurry circle. Yeah, I removed that by having more of them. Let me actually, let's see if I can do a more generic solution. Oh shit. Actually, this is salvageable. Right, so this is what we have right now. Okay. This is so goofy. You get the idea though, right? Can I just remake the model like that? I think that would just fix it. That's what you want, right? Like this, and then with the texture at the front. Yeah, is that what you want? Does it look better? Good, good, good. Just get the color right. It looks approximately like this to me. A bit more orange. That's too orange. Hey, there we go. Honestly, people say that everything in game development takes so long, but considering how big of a part this game is, and how much we just got done here, doesn't seem that much of a big deal to me. Fucked up Donkey Kong of the week. Is it the AI one? Oh, nevermind. Wait, I've seen this before. I know of this one. Did you show us this last week? I think so. Yeah, I think you've shown us this last week. Or maybe me and Zeyna just experienced it somewhere else. It is a very funny DK regardless. Look, sometimes when I say I work on the Black Boss, I work on the Black Boss, and sometimes I don't. I feel like I did 90% of the work on the Black Boss actually just off stream and not on stream, because every time I come on stream, there's a different thing that I have to do. And we just never get to work on the Black Boss. Last week was the robot Yoshi. What? Wait, the robot Yoshi? Oh, the fact of Yoshi, yes, of course. I thought you were saying last week I was working on the robot Yoshi, and I'm like, is this the ultimate gaslight of all time? Hello, Beta. If you hot and pinned my comment on your most recent video, I am not doing that. The views I lose from having unnecessary stuff like that pinned is far outweighing your five bucks. Mexico. All right. Dude, the star down there looks so cool. I want it. Six bucks. Okay, deal. Joking, don't send me the money. I'm not doing it. Actually do send me the money, but I'm still not doing it. Man, nothing in this level works, really, nothing. Okay, but this place is so cool. Wait, why is the star so high? That's the only star that's so high up in the air. That is funny. Okay. Let me move that star down a little bit. Because that's a problem. I want the player to be able to reach it easily. Does that hole have collision? Did it or didn't it? Yes. That was just me having a checkbox that said no collision active on accident. Stuff like that doesn't exist in final, I hope. Why was the star... Oh, actually the rotation is fine. So in RTY I actually have the guideline that every star is exactly 300 rounds off the floor. Fun fact. Or no, every star is 200 floors, boxes are 300. But this one is gonna be 300, just because I want this to be well visible from the top. You should have spray paints around the levels, some of them. Weren't a bunch of you talking about level ideas? And then no one said anything other than music level, which I already said no to. This star is not possible for a button challenge, just the way it is right now. Unless you find a cool trick anyway. Paper Mario level? That'd be very cool. But we have a patch of Paper Mario Retro Section in this game already. So... BLG? In an A button challenge you wanna BLG? That's actually a very common thing that people spell out BLG instead of BLJ. There must be something in the human psyche just causing that to happen. And was this one ready to go by a way? Look how cool this one is. Old timey level? Like what would be in it though? He's not... Okay, that's not T-posing, that's just flying. Every bird does that. Yes, a Paper Mario Retro Section is planned. We don't have one yet actually. Just some cloud textures. You don't want the clouds to move? I can animate them. Like a little bit. I think we should animate the clouds at least a little bit.  Also there's one problem with the clouds here and that is a triangular tessellation and not a hex one. So scrolling this is gonna look weird. I might move this into a hex tessellated one. So what do you think of that? Have this be animated clouds? Proper like vertex animation? You're gonna have the bird flying away? The bird does fly away at the end as soon as you select a star. I do have all the Retro Sections planned out but I'm not 100% happy with them. Let me see. We have Paper Mario 64 Goomba Town, Mario Paint, Dr. Mario, Mario Land 1 and one more, Smash 64. So if you have a bad idea for any of them, you can let me know and maybe I can still swap them out. But we looked at all of the Retro Games for a long time and we found nothing decent. Okay, I'm just gonna turn this into a hex tessellated floor and move the cloud actually. You know what? The way this looks, I don't think we need that. This actually just looks fine the way it is. I technically can, yes. I'm not doing Mario 64's Retro Stage. But you won't? That is also true. Beta knows me well at this point. He's been here for a bit, he knows the drill. So you can ride the hype wave by making Mario Wonder 64 where this Wonder Seed says activate Chaos Mario Mode. Hmm. Yeah, maybe. But I mean, okay, I don't actually know anything about Mario Wonder. Maybe I need more info on what a Wonder Seed is before I really understand this concept. I haven't played Mario Wonder, I'm planning to play it with my kids in like 5 years or something. I don't know. We need some time to ride the wave. I can shitpost something together in a few hours, I'm sure. Which course is this? Just watched a new video, understood everything. Nice. That's good. I'm trying to make it easy to understand. Huh? That pipe has no warp in it? The fuck? I don't have kits, so maybe one day. It's a dummy pipe, it's just there for decoration. What the fuck? How can this be? Wait, I renamed that into Jurassic Jungle instead of Dino Dino Land. Jurassic Jungle kind of fits. Yeah, I just didn't realize. There's 7, so that's 6, 8, and 7. This one's 9. Is Lofty Lumberleaf's course 10? No way! Huh? Yeah, this is Lofty Lumberleaf's. It's 8! I have made a DK64, let's see switch conks anywhere. Unfortunately, DK64 is still a garbage game even with that. Very unfortunate. I think DK64 is a very charming piece of shit. It's like really cool to look at, but playing it is like the worst thing ever. Wait, I can't even enter the level. Now it works? Something clearly went wrong. There must have been a bug that just destroyed the thing. Oh, I don't like that. That is a bad bug to have in your game. Do you want any kind of fade-in for this? Oh, right, the fuck bug again. I think I know how to render the bird on top. Never mind. Hmm. 981 and 996. Just silently judging my decisions, that's fine. I actually do not mind being judged at all. I actually kind of like it. Hey! I really have to fix that course icon. What's wrong with it? It doesn't fit with the rest of them. I think that should be animated. We're gonna scroll the clouds. That was the plan anyway. Whatever. I was thinking of also making him go up and down, but I don't know. I'll listen to Biomech. If he says don't animate them on the Z-axis, then that's what's gonna be. Y-axis in R64. Okay. You're leaving a casey stack in the game? Like you're requiring more impression?  The player shouldn't even know that I exist when he plays this game. That way, if in the future I get cancelled on Twitter, no one has to put down the game. Welcome back, Rila. It's not Twintet's ex. Okay, but an ex sounds like a porn site. I don't want to say that I'm gonna get cancelled on a porn site. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 4, 1 is 0. Okay, there we go. 13, 13, 13, 13. It is 13. Eh? Jumping has a 1 in 10 million chance to have the Chris Pratt voice instead. Is this what you want? Dude, I really feel like the clouds should move up and down. This just doesn't seem right to me. Nah, I think Biobank's wrong on this one. We're definitely gonna make the clouds move up and down. You don't see any clouds? Well, that's a whole other issue then. I've never contradicted this. Oh, I asked you if I should do this and you didn't respond. So I thought, oh, maybe he doesn't want me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, guys. Guess what food Biobank is making. Whoever guesses the closest gets moderator. He's French for context. He's making baguette. Okay, good guess. Snails, sandwich, soup. Cereal, French fries. French onion soup.  Frogs, lobster. Lobster, yeah? All good guesses. Nobody's even come close. He's making chocolate pudding. Time's up. Nobody found it. Damn. Rougali. That sounds like a noodle. Okay, there's definitely a wave, but it's moving very slowly. Okay. Honestly, I was thinking Biobank himself would make a guess and he would get the closest to the real answer, and then I was just gonna map Biobank again. Because I don't want to moderate any of y'all. This was all a hoax to get more chat engagement. Okay, I think this is too much right now. Should be smaller. That's it. No more messages from me. I'm not getting tricked by the streamer. Fuck him.  It's opening up in the back. That's not good. That's not good. All right, I think we've got it. You only have one right now? Really? Can I make you like a full amount somehow? Or do you mean like you want the login data from my channel? Because you're not getting those. The mac and mac and cheese stands for mac and cheese. It does not. Okay, guys, fight to the death. Whoever's right wins. Where are the clouds? On the floor. This level is above the clouds. Okay, where is this bird? Oh, the bird is right here on the branch here. Then during the idle animation, he's still right there on the branch. Then when he flies out, he is also on the branch. Perfect. We can make this work. Okay. I want him to be in a new blend file.  Fuck. Don't you know clouds are supposed to be upwards? SMH my hat. Oh, so the S and SMH stands for SMH my hat. There's a translate rotate bone in this. Is that in my normal birds as well? No. It's only in Biobank's version.  But it should render fine regardless and we do not care about performance here. So it's fine, I think. I hope it renders right. I don't know if that feature is still supported. The thing about the RTUI engine is that a lot of suboptimal things simply don't work anymore because they are suboptimal and supporting them in code takes additional performance. I don't think we need the Omegi in our spawn. Let's see what position is he at. He's got a pretty weird transform. Let's see if he shows up. If not, I'll probably have to invert to see. No blark. Unfortunately, we are stuck in... Making... level select backscreens, hell. He's over there, that's not where I wanted him. Also there was still a hole. I work from home, I'm never gonna go into an office. I see. Why was he so far back? I'm a little bit clueless on that one. Also this jar is minus 194, what if I buy... ...this? Hmm... Let me see that again and see where exactly he is. Why is he over there? Do I need to... add this? Doesn't seem right to me. Yeah, that's my sister-in-law. Hey! The bird is here. My opinion on Motos is I do not care about Motos. Look, if it wasn't good enough for the beta of Mario 64, it's probably not great. I don't know. This animation should not be looping, actually. Alright, now the bird should be flying in. Biobank is my sister-in-law? What? Yup. Huh? That is not at all what I wanted. But there is no block in this game, just the e-nut. Hey! He's just a bit too low. Hey... Sup. Alright, next animation is idle. If this is good, we can move on to the next animation here, which does loop. Alright, so next you should code in the auto-squish text. That's gonna take a bit more than this. Ah! Ah! It's so good! It's so good! The twitch! It's this little tail twitch! Yeah! This is a bird's hop in our backyard! Yeah! It's not quite done yet, because we need one more thing. When you press the A button, like that, the bird is supposed to take off and fly into the screen. What? Some other bird was 100 times easier than the submarine. Dude, the submarine, the stupid sign function, that's a GCC thing. I don't blame myself for that. How did it just link the sign table to a random thing instead of telling me that there's no sign table? I take no blame for that. Oh, interesting. So if this is how it works, we can just move this here. Wait, why is this programmed like this? What is wrong with Nintendo for doing this? It was 1996, they didn't know what bitflex were. Okay. You know what? We can do this multiple times, it doesn't matter. Wouldn't be a problem in C++. True. It's probably also not a problem in C. But still, the fact that someone typed that out. Maybe I do need this, but that doesn't make any sense. I shouldn't be needing this. Okay. Am I still into the Mario franchise? I don't know, I just like good games. Wait. Okay, he shouldn't be warping when I do that, which he didn't do. But it doesn't look like he's taking off either. Yeah, as soon as I press A, everything just freezes. You see how he instantly warps over there? Wait. Come on. Everything just freezes when I press A. That's problematic. Because I do want the bird to update. But I think this function stops running. Once you press A. I see. Okay.  Oh, that's not good at all. Huh. I didn't think it would do that. Why does it do that? Hmm. Okay, this is gonna require a little bit more finessing. What are you trying to do? I'm trying to make it so that the objects still update while this is happening. Right now they just freeze in place. Hmm. There's also the issue that this is 10 frames and the animation here is like 40 frames. 128. But still. Oh, I guess it doesn't look bad at half length. I think we might have to do that. I might have to make it so that there's a bit of a delay here. I think that's fine for the effect. Okay. Kinda dirty, but it should work pretty well. I'm not streaming for 24 days in a row, I would probably die. Yeah, what do you think? I think it works, mostly. I think we need to change the shading on him a little bit. Because he seems to be ruining the shadows. Ah, the fog. Ah, makes sense.  Let the animation finish. The animation did finish, Leila. It just didn't look like it because he had no fog. Just like you, you get no fog. You get no bitches. Shit. Okay, maybe 18. The freezing was kinda bad. Guys, just wait. Man, he's still not fully in the background. That sucks. Did I not export the animation? Let me try this. Case, that room looks unfinished. Case, why is the thing that you're working on not finished yet? Huh.  Nope, I have no plans to hang out with game consoles. He doesn't fully disappear. Does he just not fully disappear in the animation? You know what, I think the fix here is to make the thing just go longer. Oh yeah, he doesn't fully disappear in the animation. Okay. Oh. Yeah, so the fix here is not to make the thing last longer. The 5 frame steal line is perfectly fine. The solution here is to make it so that it advances while the fadeout is playing. We're gonna do that. But we're gonna do that another time. I don't think I can do it today. This will be enough for today. Yeah, but he doesn't fully fade out, right? Like he's here. But this is fine because we're gonna have the level fade out so you don't see that he doesn't fully fade out. It's gonna look like he goes all the way in. I just need to make it so that while the fadeout is happening, the animation is actually playing. Because right now the animation just freezes while the fadeout is happening and that's a big deal. But yeah, I'll see you guys in the next stream. Until then, bye bye. Bye bye.
