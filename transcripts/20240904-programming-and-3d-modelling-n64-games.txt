Hello? Another bonus stream? Ok, bye bye Hello Velsay, hello Nico, we got the YouTube people here Hello Blendanoop64 Hello MinusMario Hello SarahCL Hello XCRC, hello Dimencio We got the whole crew here today Actually it's a whole different crew from Hello XLinks Hello Silly, what are we doing today? We are doing some 3D modeling And maybe some programming Hello Zeina You mean because he's on the bench because we did come video All right, that's all I'm good for no kidding Eat the streak I Wasn't really thinking of having a streak. I was just thinking I got a date to myself. Why not just stream? I'm Busy working long hours to feed my wife and five children How many of those are imaginary Leela You So ever since x3 we have one little bug in the game Then I will definitely need to fix But I'm not sure what causes this because I looked into this a lot and I can't figure it out And that is if a second light source appears like the star over there Morris colors just go dark the ambient just resets to zero Dang Dang what? So I'm thinking this for the ceiling I think this looks good for the ceiling We do have a few render issues here because random ones are bleeding but we can fix those Like right there, it's not supposed to look like that It's a sick this is a very early version of this it's gonna look a lot better in the end I hope Like we got to fix all those more TVs How am I roast this thing I Cannot like the The ceiling with the snow, but I'm not sure if I want to do that And these effects expense plans are not really well The thing about this level here is that everything is in rooms, right? So you see right there in the door. You can't look through it. You're gonna put that door. I'm gonna put that door Which means that this is basically guaranteed 60 FPS the effect here with the appearing path Is a little bit expensive, but not very much Other spikes not great alliance Pretty sure they are. Oh Yeah, I'm not sure about that It's up to fight more than we're probably gonna subdivide this a lot more but not yet Please don't make symmetrical ice spikes that hurts me. I never thought about what material they were made out of And then this area here I kind of started still need the ceiling I Did some in this area as well as stream Heard calendar controller, I don't know. I don't really look at my controller when I play the game Doesn't matter to me, but I think the green one Feels like it plays the best just because of the color, you know, how red cars go faster than like blue cars And like when you put a stripe on your car, your car goes faster in The same way the yellow did the green control and 64 controller works better This effect here with the focus also completely free I Thought it's kind of the parts of the submerged. Yeah, definitely. I already have the subdivisions for it I just kind of want like a nice space for this whole thing and There's this thing in blender where sometimes the UVs just get messed up with new versions because of the bad follow-up watching just a means So that's where some stuff is bad I also noticed an issue with the donation page step. I have on my twitch or YouTube It seems that there's no donation alerts happening, and I don't know why There was someone that donated 50 euros twice like yesterday once last week once and I Would like to give him a shout out, but I don't know what this twitch name is and I don't want to say his real name So that's awkward Not Not coloring it doesn't make it minty for some reason true true Promise with the blend exporter script. It's not This is when you use follow active quotes. I can show you let's say I use follow active quote on this Okay, that one works Just trust me, bro Whatever use it here You Okay, bro, you just have to trust Here oh, yeah, you see that how it affects the top here You didn't update for 64 how This You There you go Lila, I hope you're happy if you had the songs coming in by AI I have What changes if you make Lilaa And I Trust fat Yoshi daddy with my life. You better not be talking about me. I'm not fat It's still the release version Okay, do you want me to switch to main? Isn't that unstable? Is it release a lot safer the Lilaa You you mr. Fan Yoshi plush how he's upstairs Zayn I want some in our living room That's so mean cocky death, why would you say that to me? Fixed issues with mad bleed. Oh That's nice Hello buy a bike Buy a bike I've done more of those skits or scrabbles and Like After watching those for like 10 minutes the next reels were like Donald Trump is a lizard person He's controlled by the lizard people Just like the Clintons. I think maybe I shouldn't be doing skits or scrabbles Mm-hmm Fine now less sinks references bleed properly and more Oh The combined exporter Let's get to travel you get skits of videos, yeah But you know what being a skit so actually saved my fucking life yesterday the funniest shit ever happened There was Someone that was like we want to advertise on your YouTube channel we are a web-free teaching School online. This is our stuff and this person seemed really legit. They had like a github linked They had their name match to get up. They they were talking to me a lot. They were referencing my videos I thought this was real. I This was like one of the most convincing advertising companies I had ever seen But When they wanted me to get a call, they were like, yeah, we use this app called V deck It has like automatic language translations is our director is German. So we prefer that and I I look at it. Well, I'm not downloading an easy file. I don't care who you are I'm not downloading and running an exe file ever no matter how legit this looks And Then they were like, oh, okay, that's fine. We can work with that Just give us like 20 minutes to get a zoom call ready and then they get a zoom call ready And it's fucking zoom dot us web dot us Not even like the real some don't go on that website. By the way, don't go it you're gonna get a virus and Then I contacted the person That was listed on the github that this person was pretending was theirs and This github belonged to someone working in anti scam software stuff Which I just finished talking to her right before the stream so right now they're actually like Locating where does the website belongs to I? think And maybe we can actually like figure out who tried to spearfish me and like fuck them up from you As far as I know they worked for like  which is a  So what we can do is just informing the users about themselves  You see like constantly like the youtubers that are like 10 hours of Bitcoin marathon, you know what I mean? What was it they wanted you to advertise they wanted to advertise a web free teaching service Basically like a website where you would learn programming for web applications You Web free is crypto blockchain bullshit. Anyway, this should have been the first sign Oh, I Did not know that You You can batch BPS files very easily online that is true, by the way We need like an OSC or something to listen to Look at how quiet case streams are before he realizes there's no music true You while I got here, can you tell me how much is the Goomba King scaled up in coach? Seven Yeah Seven one bananas no units Leela seven units Fuck you Can you be a bit more precise it's seven like exactly seven point zero zero zero zero zero, is that what you want And we're just gonna listen to Sonic Adventure 2 covers today, this is what I want I was just being funny Let's scale up seven blender Well, you would need to scale down seven and blend up, but it's very easy. You do s and then the bite sign and then seven Or you do s seven if you want to scale up And this is gonna be way too bright for a ceiling I Also want to add more of these and make the drawing distance bigger because I think it would look a lot better I love you Thank you for the 555 donation mom very appreciated I'm so glad that shut up now Wait, why is there a song request? I turned the song request off. Why is this playing? Ah, I Didn't want this I tried to prevent this  It's a good song Why can't I turn off media share this is scaled up seven Yeah, that doesn't look right I Mean look at the Guma model, maybe there's a scale bone that we can remove Because someone's song request of this I tried to turn off some requests and then this just happened Ah There's a scale bone here, oh So there's a scale 1 4.25 so you need to multiply 0.25 by 7 so the scale is 1.75 I'm back The scale bone is not supposed to be here though, and you can just remove that fuck that Do you have a death mode camera in game that can no clip around or you just bring it when placing objects in the scenes I have blender. I placed them in blender But the fuck is this rake it's probably based on the vanilla rake All right, I wanna change the ceiling in this room Actually, I think if it just faded out to black that would be sick For like two days. Surprise Monday stream Wednesday edition. I hope to be able to stream more. I want to work like a lot harder than I already work. Because I have a child now and I need more money. So hopefully there will be more streams, but I don't know how I'm going to manage the time wise since I do have a full-time job on top of being all of this is the song popular in  Nope. It's known, but it's not popular. Christian Anders the high. I don't know that guy. I'm no longer familiar with German culture. Is it unpopular? Yes. I would say so. That must be because one of the collision triangles is invalid because we have too many I really have to think about a solution for surf. It's not in this level. I might have to change the allocation per level because this is unplayable. Let's look into that's changing allocation per level. Yeah, I made my own memory allocator. What about it? I should probably just have like an accept list. This only runs on level loads. I don't care about like the three microseconds this takes to run. I thought you increased the grizzly bull size anyways, I did but now I want an increase per level. Did you see the Minecraft movie trailer? I saw someone link it and I clicked on it and then it let it play, but I didn't watch it. What's with the more frequent streams? I just want to work more. Also, I am offline for a bit, so I have more time to do stuff now. Hello Neovim. This is per level, so we don't need this like that. All right, guys. You guys want my absolute hot take on Python Rust C++ C. I think that if you care at all, like even just a little bit about which programming language you use, that is a very strong indicator that you're a terrible programmer. So if anyone tells you to use Rust, just answer skill issue. If anyone asks you to use Python, answer skill issue. All of it. Programming languages are all the same. One, two, three. Should current ID be an assembly? Okay, maybe you can care a little bit. But if it's like a reasonable programming language, it doesn't make a difference. For most things. Compiler configuration is coming for you to rewrite the level condition and position codes. No. Yeah, I guess if there's a specific purpose that the language can ensure, that's different. But if it's like C++ versus Rust, it's like, who cares? You shouldn't care. Or if you're writing a simple application to add a list of numbers together, who cares? Did I misspell this? Do I need this here? I do. What's your favorite esoteric programming language? Assembly. Does programming malbolge? It doesn't even matter what language you use, so why not? What's that? I can't just listen to a random German Conspiracy Theory song. That's just not on point for the stream. No, guys, my concession is as long as it's a reasonable programming language. And I get that that's a very wishy-washy definition. But if you have like a basic application that doesn't need to do much, that's just like whatever, like a GUI with things. It doesn't matter if you use Java or C or C++ or Rust. It's all the same. Malbolge, not malbolge. Malbolge. All right, I'll look up malbolge. Yeah, this seems completely reasonable. Yeah, this definitely goes under reasonable programming languages. Good suggestion. Is it reasonable to use Python in performance-dependent programming? Which part needs to be performant? There's so many rooms in the kitchen and bedroom. I hope so. All right, that should solve our collision issues. The problem here is that because the triangles are so big, because the triangles are so big, there need to be a lot of pool nodes, because all the nodes have to be in every single cell. And we have to use cells, so the collision runs a little faster. I'm thinking that maybe gkerlevelnum is not set here. That seems very possible to me. You know what? I prefer the smaller code. Are you not sure? Yeah, I can't listen to this. I'm sorry. I ruined it, I know. Let's just make sure that it actually is gkerlevelnum being set. I'm just hard-coding this. Okay, what if I use 32,000? Just like a hard-coded value, just to test, just testing. There's also a chance that we're out of nodes, but I just can't see that. Like the nodes, really? We barely have any collision triangles. All of this is so flat. We have levels that use way more collision triangles than that. What the hell? Alright, let's try this with 8,000. My mom is off to pick up my mats, probably for the last time. After that, you're done with your mats, your heals? Oh, you won't be able to get them yourself. It is the normal surface pool? No way. I feel like the reflection in the walls could be better. Like, yeah, it looks nice, but I think it can be nicer. So there's no separate collision mesh, right? Anti-circulating against the level mesh directly? Um, no. There's a separate collision mesh. What if the wall jumps up to the black void? Then there won't be a wall, or a ceiling, rather. Yeah, there's games like Banjo-Kazooie, where the vertices are used in both the collision and the visual map. But that's the exception and not the rule. Yeah, let's make sure that the current level is actually also set here. By the way, what do you mean? I just mean, like, I was just making a joke that, like... What's the joke? Uh, like you're insane, but like you will stay insane forever. Since FBDX3 now runs faster, would it make sense to micro-optimize it? Yes, absolutely. And I hope to do that one day, but it will be a lot harder. I kinda like the way this looks. But there needs to be something to like more imply that you can actually get in from the outside. Try Fade to Black. It's gonna be a question. Oh! So it's not bipolar meds? It did stop taking it. Oh, well then. I see. I would imagine that you drinking so much coffee doesn't help. Damn, dude. You're jacked. Yeah. We'll do Approach Angle at some point. Approach Angle? Yes, that would be a big one. Micro-optimizing the microcode? Dude, that's gonna be like, that's gonna be a little bit crazy. Even for me, because I don't know anything about that microcode yet. Except like some really basic as like newbie things. So that will be a good piece of work. But before I even think about that, I will wait until Sauron is done with everything he wants to do. But I think there's a lot of gains to be had in the RSP with some creative programming. He said it gets me to not sleep and it turned me into feel more anxious. So then I can get out. But it did get shaky. Caffeine helped? Dang. I saw a meme on Instagram today and the meme said, what is Gaea? And on the left side, there was just like a gay pride flag. And on the right side, there was like an Andrew T added with like cars. What do you guys think? Which one is? What is this? Oh, it turned into my playlist. Whoops. All right, Fargan, we're listening to these musics now. It turned into brain damage music. I'm very sorry. And today is probably your closet gang. That's funny you say that because you're not the first one to say that to me. I know someone who genuinely believes that and they made a really good point. But you have a rave dance remix. I don't know. Just boom, boom, boom. And I like that this is the only room without the snow on top. I messed this up somehow. What the hell is this? I don't know. They have a lot of extras in. God damn. She admitted it during an interview. Who?  She admitted what? I can't see what it's about. It's kind of like the N64 games would all look so incredibly cheap. No, I can't physically release this game, Christian. Because if I do, I will get giga sued by Nintendo. I think this side here is like basically done now. Same with the bottom part. Oh, actually, the mirror room here is missing. Extra femme pharmacists. The woman shaped pharmacists. So true. I'm planning on releasing this time. I will release a patch that will contain only my own changes. And then you will be able to patch this patch onto an N64 ROM. And if you want. You can put this patched ROM onto like an EverDrive cartridge or probably you can sell from an unauthorized seller on Etsy which you know there's a lot of people just illegally selling my games and that should work too but that is not officially encouraged. I noticed an issue with the mirror room. If we do the mirror room like this then the mirror would clip into this. So a room without a ceiling could be used for a storage room for weapons or some stuff yeah we'll figure stuff out I'm sure This music sucks. I'm sorry about today's music we're just gonna go for random songs. It's gonna take six months to rework. Oh god I hope not. Oh but didn't that do that poor of a job? Just like chipmunk you can't sing to words without soft whistling. It hurts my ears but that is what makes you... What do you mean soft whistling? What is the soft whistling I'm doing? I want more information about this. The level is huge. Yeah it's about the same size as the ship I would say. You creepy old man. I thought entertain fans were like young people. Why not put the mirror on the other side? That makes a lot of sense yes. I can't argue with that logic. What is this soft whistling guys? I need info. What am I doing? Now someone else is hearing it too. It's not just as in this level is hushy. What are you guys talking about? What the? This song is so Infected Mushroom coded while it is an Infected Mushroom song. The new demo is going to go so hard. You understood Peter Thiel sexual science? I have never even heard of Peter Thiel. You don't whistle while washing my teeth? You wash your teeth? You don't brush them? You don't wash your teeth with soap? I typically don't. Should I? Have I been missing out? Is this good? Any teeth washers in chat? Can you tell me? If you wash your teeth and then you eat like soap flavored candy. Is that like the same to you as like mint flavored candy as to people that brush their teeth? Are you going to hate it? Are you gonna like it? Wait, there's another issue with this and that is the mirror doesn't work this way. Hello the perfect Mario 64. We got to move this to the other side after all. Just on the other side. Yep, that is exactly my plan. I'm going to make this a bit better as well because now the second actually like works this way. Actually, no, you're still gonna bonk if you do that. Oh, the mirror all the way to the top. All right, then it's a decent idea. You see his name every day, but you don't know who he is. What? Yeah, we saw a whole lemon crescent moon after brushing my teeth, so it doesn't smell. Do you think mint smells bad? That's also an unusual opinion. I can't listen to Pink Nightmares like 15 times in a row. What do you do with reusable assets? Do you have empty objects in the bender scene and you move them to when drawing them in the game? I just have actors. Y'all are just confusing to me right now. This is, of course, likely not the final look of the room, but just for the sake of like having an idea of what the mirror is going to look like, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. And I'll be of the house. Nope. Space going to make over last time. Yeah, it's starting to look like a real thing. It's a very cool. What is your favorite and 64 of equal? I think for the peacoat. Dang, that's a tough question. I don't have a strong preference for anyone. Two thousand fifty. One thousand and fifty. Oh, God, by the way, it's going to hit me for this. It's going to be that case. Why didn't you make it perfect squares? I don't know. Fix it now while you can. Before the wrath of Biobak murders me. All right, let's figure out where the issue even is. Is it here? It's a 75. It's a hundred. So it's just two thousand, two hundred and fifty. It is two thousand, two hundred and fifty. I don't know. Fine, just for you. I fixed this. I need to remap this. There you go. They're not square. Changing a surprisingly high amount of things. OK, that's exciting. I'm going to reduce the cost being way too bright in some spots. And I'll make them way too bright anywhere. I'm making a game and I have a flag that I'm putting everywhere and I want to reuse it in other scenes without loading the model files. Is there no like globally loaded things that you can just reuse them from? Room for improvement on LiDAR? That sounds hype, actually. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. I need to do some research for these mirrors. Let me make sure the mirrors work. And then I think we're going to change these mirrors to instead work flag based. We're going to have one flag determining the axis. And then it's just going to be two bits. And then we're going to have, I think this is eight bits. So we have six bits left to like define ranges. Oh, yeah. You can really tell that the lighting does not work in X2 here. Goddamn. It actually gets darker when I get close to the thing. And it's going to be brighter. Something's really messed up here. That's just a thing I use to get around the game faster. Let's me explain. The parameter is an S16. Oh, okay. So we get 32 bits. All right. Parameter on definition. We're going to change this up. We need one axis to be defined. That's like the axis we mirror on. And then we need two ranges and one point. So how do we best get that? What if we just say, fuck it, we have a six S16 structure with three ranges each. And then on the mirrored axis, the ranges just happen to be the same. I think that is going to be computationally cheaper as well. So. Axis. Zero X, one Y, zero Z. It's being sigma cringe. Depends on how ironic you're about it. If you're a little ironic about it, yes, that is cringe. If you're a hundred percent, not ironic about it at all. And you live it your entire life. I'll accept that. That's not cringe. You guys know that guy that just like pretends to be crazy being in the gym. It's like insane trend in his veins. And where's the Joker mask? That guy just out of this world. Just include the level data. Don't link it. That's not possible. Oh, yes. Of course. That's an emulator we use for debugging. All women are the best kind of women. What about pervs? Oh, he just admitted to them being the best. Hello. There's not specifically women get old. Oh, I thought they were. Never mind then. Maybe the light is set to 0x8 and not 0x9 for light direction. No. So we have three instances of this. Two in JRB. We have two. Oh, yeah. Wait, why is there a mirror? Why term? Why is this mirror? Why term used on? What the fuck are these variable names? I just made shit up, didn't I? Mirror X is actually the mirror Z. Oh, my God. Interesting. Oh, this is a problem. We need another entry. Mirror, access, mirror and section. I think that works best. Unspecified access, mirror around this point on the axis. I think engineering phaser runners are modos, definitely modos. Women are so cool, except when they're like Nazis and stuff. My favorite Mario enemy, Boshi from Super Mario RPG, he's cool. That should do it, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, there we go. I have used Wispik in one of my games. This was 2013, Peach's Christmas invitation. I have used Wispik. He is a static mesh flying in a circle and you should rock some. This was way back when I used to work with UD on these things. Boshi is an enemy? What do you mean? He's so mean to you. Call him Wispik? Why would you do that? This is another floor mirror, so this is going to be the z-axis again. You know what? Since this is an 8-byte data structure anyway, fuck it, we're just going to sit here, relax. This makes more sense. It's going to be stocked up to 8-bytes anyway, so who cares. I did this wrong. This should do it. Then this one is the x-axis. This one is the y-axis and this one is the y-axis. Can I do Diddy Kong Racing to March 64? I'm going to make the RSP run at 500%. No. Interesting, it's a memcopy. I guess I wrote that. I would do that. I don't know. What are we doing today? We are adding Emberra right now. Why is this not working? Invent type argument. There we go. Why do you name the files like that? Like what? Hello, Zerf here. Does your NFGC also add random calls to memcopy or memset when you didn't ask for it? Memcopy, yes, all the time. If you copy a struct, it's always going to insert memcopy. But... I have a protection against that. In my memcopy, I actually receive the RA register with some inline assembly. And then whenever I use memcopy, I print the RA register. Which means I get a RAM pointer to the exact code that called the memcopy. And then I just remove that. Hello, Przep, that's some nice chows you're posting. RA is wearing memcopy protection, true. This is what people mean when they talk about memory safety. I know about the arguments. She sips a Coca-Cola. She can't tell the difference yet. She can't tell the difference yet. Dude, chow are great. Fun fact, when I was playing Sonic Adventure 2 for the first time as a little baby. And I had never played Sonic Adventure 1 before. I remember I got stuck on the first boss. It said, you need to hit the cockpit. And I, like seven-year-old German little me, be like, cockpit? What is a cockpit? I don't know what a cockpit is. And I thought Sonic Adventure 2, dude, it sucks. I don't want to play this. I can't get anywhere. But then I played City Escape again. And I found the chow garden. And the game was saved. She can't tell the difference yet. She can't tell the difference yet. She said, oh no. I never got past the Aspen Sunshine as a kid. Because the protoprana was really scary to me. So I turned off the game. Yes, last drive, it's a bonus stream. I never got to put a slash zero at the end of the string. You don't need to put a slash zero at the end of the string. Strings automatically put a zero at the end of that. I don't know. I don't know. I was like seven when I beat Majora's Mask. I was not scared by random stuff like that. Wait, this is an excess of two. It's mirrored around the Z. Not the X. Should be fine. And then this needs to be inverted, right? The scale needs to be inverted for sure. And it needs to be grabber and active. But then this one doesn't invert the axis. I guess I only need to invert the jaw if the axis is not one. Makes sense. I guess that's the jaw axis. Alright, let's see if the mirrors still work. And if they do, we have a much easier system to use mirrors now. Would you A, go to JP's Mario Park B? JP's Mario Park B, Disneyland C, Disney World. D, be sucked into Mario 64 Roadmap while you are in the game. Can I pick the Mario 64 Roadmap? Because there's a few where I'd love to be in. I'm sure. I could make one that I'd love to be in. Oh, when generating them. Of course. What, you're just going to end it with nothing in memory? That is obvious. Come on. If you're forgetting about that, you kind of deserve your program to go to shit. Okay, it all works except the jaw. The jaw is wrong. Because it needs to be this. Is it more than 30 FPS? No. Is it not enough? No way, that's 30 FPS. No one's going to notice me now. Shut up. Maybe. Damn.  Okay, it works. Now we need course 4 to be... Actually, there's another thing in course 3. Just making sure all my murals work. When did you first hear about FPS and other gaming design concepts? When I first heard about FPS, I don't know. I must have been small. Okay. The minmine needs to be slightly lower on this one. When did I first learn about textures? Probably when I was like 16. I know, I know, that was late. When did you gain conscious? That's a difficult question, honestly. Because what counts as the start of your consciousness? Is it when your first memory formed? My first memory is probably me just being 3 or 4 years old. How old were you with your first memory, huh? I don't know. Surely you learned about textures before. With the recent Pokemon Sun and Moon 3 controversy, surely you would have heard about textures. Alright, one more mural to check. Okay, to be fair, pants. I lived in Europe, okay? I played Ocarina of Time on a PAL Nintendo 64 at 16 FPS. Me counting the frames in a second manually is not even that unreasonable. That absolutely could have happened. I had Bionicles growing up, yes. Damn, the lights are really wrong. Holy shit. I thought there were minor issues with it, but nothing works at all. Is the reflection working? I don't know. I don't see a mirror of Mario here. It's supposed to be a slightly shiny floor. I don't know. I don't think there's one. Hang on, did I run into that native Mario Bros. PC port? MrMySkinDolphin has been doing that for years already. Okay, well, do you understand why people hype up the PC port? Because it's basically the same as a PC port. I don't understand why people hype up the PC port. But it is basically the same as a PC port. The thing that's kind of nice about the static recompilation, or about this project specific, is that WiseGuy is working on it, and WiseGuy knows what he's doing. And because of that alone, it's going to be decent. And it's going to be cool stuff, like all the shaders they can add now. But other than the fact that WiseGuy is working on it, there's nothing to get excited about. Wait, the 5981 is the Z-axis, is it not? Maximera5981. Oh my god, I really fucked this up. No wonder it didn't work. I still want to play with it as a kid, but didn't get to have. I wasn't ever a kid that wanted much. I was in the fucked up situation. I, as a kid, wanted so few things that my parents would tell me, go watch advertisements so that we know what to get you for Christmas or your birthday. I was just Zen, I guess. There we go. Hey, there's Mirror Mario. This is what we wanted. Alright, we can delete all this bullshit now. Dude, this is gonna be the easiest system to add new murals ever Dude, this is gonna be the easiest system to add new murals ever Dude, this is gonna be the easiest system to add new murals ever And he said sure so that's gonna be my entire exposure I'm just gonna be using it for cloud I don't actually care about it I'm also It's RT 64 done What do you mean This is the z-axis Like did he release it and no one cared surely it hadn't been released I would have heard about it Okay, but is it released it's not I'm gonna bite you Lila. Shit. I didn't export the mirror position I Would not be released to recommend open-source case are you stupid Yeah, but it's not Dario never told me it's done. Okay, so it's not done. That's my logic. It's done when Dario tells me it's done You It's an actively in work progress, so it's not done I Something is wrong here Yeah, that seems more reasonable It's Unreleased so you could say it's done Okay, but they never told me it's released. So it doesn't count They never released released it Why am I up here and not down there Sus No, I guess I did duplicate the object Yeah, I guess I can walk all the way down there I T4 use us see you're telling me there's no RT for users then what do you want me to do? I wonder what the speedrun strategy here would be you just dash through it Just say fuck it Hey The mirror is here and it looks as cool as I thought it would I Why is this Mario offset from the floor It's like he's a frame behind Oh No Oh That is cold areas Maybe I still know what you mean. They are running at the same frame rate right now But I can't remember because of normal cameras What the fuck of course, it's not perfectly correct make sense So that mario bleeds together with the camera I would say this is maybe a bug So That would do it Um Am I shaded differently by the way, yeah, that is also a bug Something with the shading is really broken right now. I'm still trying to figure out why It's because of emulator only code On emulator only I load x2 geo mario lights instead of geo mario lights And something is going wrong here and i'm not sure what it is  Basically, I try to copy the exact lights but also the x2 struct instead of the x3 struct Right, that's why I have x2 lights here I need to do this because of emulator But for some reason the ambient seems to completely disappear So The problem with this is that it all seems good to me And I have no idea what the culprit could be So At least you don't use unions, yeah, I just passed the data type that is so much better So    This works man, we have two new good systems today I'm just gonna delete this for now. We know that we have to change this anyway, but we can do that later We got mirror mario working What's our next room to work on So I don't really like this room this room here is weird and janked Let me show you why I think the camera is too short here So I'm actually thinking maybe I should make the doors so that if you are far away from the door They are solid and don't let the camera pass through So Yeah, so when you're here it's like This really short pathway. I think this is a little bit cringe Instead we should just fuse it with this room before or the room after God why is this new blender ue mapping so god awful actually makes me sad Yeah Being able to reduce the amount of rooms we have would also be kind of nice Well, ideally in the end there would be no more flames on your butt and you would just get hurt So I'm thinking we make something out of this Yeah, the direction for the light seems fine it's the the intensity of the light the color of the light that seems to get wrong But it works just fine on x3. I can show you on console I don't actually know if this level boots on console So Okay, let's test the level and see the performance keep in mind no rules implemented yet Meaning the performance should be absolute dog shit right now compared to what it will be 23 fps without even actually like fixing anything. That's pretty good Yeah, the light seems to work fine Yeah, it's pretty good Are any of your initials I think something's going wrong with the look at an x3 And that's why the floor looks like that And of course these render issues here it's like just something I haven't done yet i'm not worrying about those So This looks just like a bleeding potato, okay, we're in the acai unfinished rooms, okay stop hating Passable yeah, but we didn't even do the rooms yet the game is rendering the entire castle at the same time right now The entire castle is either gonna run 60 fps in the end i'm pretty sure So I think we can expect similar performance as in this area here if this area works on n64 45 that's decent. I definitely have to unlimit the drawing distance for those guys 30 fps Drawing distance is doing those guys dirty some camera issue here matrix overflow for sure How's rsp Rsp is at 13 so we could technically run this at um like 80 fps 70 In the main area I can try let's see Yeah, the lag is basically all rsp actually this looks like rdp like But yeah, let's expect it This performance is absolutely not indicative at all of what will actually happen in the final game Hello twister Yeah Yeah, still no idea why these lights are weird that will be something for another day probably off stream One of x2 yes x2 runs the rsp slower, that's why we're switching to x3 Are you not here when we are talking about that lila, did you miss the stream with me and Sauraen? We Found out that the bottleneck is actually the rsp and not the rdp Yeah, yeah, that's the entire reason my course one was like stuck at 46 fps because the rsp was the bottleneck And when we only improved the rsp performance in x3, that's when it went up So Someone just made a random issue on fast 64, what's the issue? I don't see it So I see so what do we put here? I Actually don't even see who's coming from youtube i'm just coming from twitch at the moment so I cannot pick a favorite  I don't have any more creative ideas for platforming with all these challenges. We've already made So It could just be a field of snow with the snow demon in it like At this point why not We probably underutilize these anyway, yeah, I actually want to use them more I should probably place them more in the castle like general Because they are a cool enemy And they feel very minty You said for a yoshi coin already have the yoshi coins written down wait Let me see Yoshi coin in the big investor at the top secret warp pipe We have that in smash an ice statue with the snow from snowball enemy. That's a very cool one Non-solid vault somewhere needs a good enough end. Okay, we don't have that Small icicle triple jump wall kick for yoshi coin. Maybe not Usually can be no ice platform with tons of jumps. Okay, we have that one in Super mario logan cli same the real super mario logan. Oh my god big fan when you made Bowser jr. Say peepee poopoo, dude, that was my favorite moment in cinema You know what, if you fall in here, you deserve to be attacked by these guys. I think that's only fair. I also think it's very unbranded for this area. Can I get a choccy milk, Aleffy? If any of you see me in public and offer me a choccy milk, you will be my favorite viewer. Just saying. Damn, I don't like the shape for this room. Well, I guess we end here with X3, per-level micro exchanges and future new mathematics integration. I'm sure there will be a lot of new things with X3. I'm sure we'll be able to come up with a lot of cool new triangle drawing algorithms that no one's thought about yet, especially at Nintendo. The problem with it is that it's so difficult that just being creative with code is not good enough. You need to actually be really, really good at programming to be able to contribute anything to X3. And you need to learn specifically about the micro codes and how the RSP and stuff works, at least I would imagine so. And I haven't done that yet. So before I can contribute to that, there will need to be a lot of learning involved. That's a little better. What even is choccy milk? It's milk and choccy. Use tri-strips, that too. Yeah, okay, my plan actually is, I want to use tri-strips, but I am going to release an emulator version of the finished game first. Basically, my plan is version 1 of Return to Yoshi's Island is going to work on emulator and N64. Version 1.1 is going to work on both and have the bug fixes from the first thousands of hours of gameplay that we found in there. This will be likely like a version I release, like a month after release. And then I will ditch emulator support entirely. I'm thinking something like that. Why ditch emulator support? Because supporting emulators makes the entire game run slower. Hello, new cactus. Dude, I really want to fix the lighting bug. I want to check how course 3 looks like on N64. I want to see that it actually works correctly. Yeah, Ares doesn't work at all actually. No, I think Rescue is still working on it. Let's go. Oh, that's nasty looking. I mean, the light works, it just doesn't look very good. I don't know why it's doing this. I did have the same bug before. No, this is not flat shading. I will only run on N64, that's what I mean, don't coyote. Yeah, it's not flat shading, it looks perfect without any directional lights. Yeah, it should still work on accurate emulators, but we don't have accurate emulators yet. No, version 1 and version 1.1 will work just fine on emulators, you don't have to worry about it. It's just that after I make sure I made a good version for emulators and fix the first wave of bugs that we catch, I am going to go and say fuck it, I want this game to run as well on N64 as it can. Then it's going to run N64 eventually, so you should keep support for less accurate emulators. Ah, well if Glidon is going to support that, then maybe I don't even need to ditch the emulator support, which would be even better. Because I have no desire to ditch it, it's just that if I don't ditch it, I lose out on other things, you know. Yeah, I can show you what Arras looks like right now. It's not even anything I'm planning, it's just that what the game is right now doesn't work in Arras. Typical Arras, getting stuck here. No, that's the wrong game. No, that's the wrong game. Oh, well it's even worse than it looked before. This is what Arras looks like. The demo is just going to be Course 1, only the first level. I'm kind of content with this part. I want this to be a no-walking area to force the player to walk above this crystal. I'll probably start at the entrance. Wait, actually that would be crazy Lila, because I do only target Glidon. If I can use Trifence and Tristeps, oh my god, I would be so happy. Look at the code I sent. All right. I wonder if that's what Tristeps make? I don't know. The reason I don't know is that I have no idea how they're implemented. I can just make the educated guess that either it's one, you have less comments, so there's less throughput for data. Or two, maybe there's some special calculations the RSP can do where it keeps the vertices like loaded in some temporary buffer and that causes things to go faster. If it's the second, that would be insane. If it's the first, it might actually be worse. Yeah, I'm not gonna trust any emulator ever to actually be accurate to what N64 acts like. It's not even anything against emulator creators, it's just that the N64 is fucked up. The problem with super accurate emulators is also going to be that it's going to be difficult for people to use them. Because to get such accurate emulation, you obviously need to have much more expensive hardware. No, the PC port is completely fucked. I can't do anything with that. The PC port doesn't support any of the special combiners I do. So on the PC port you will not be able to play this game, unless someone does a lot of work into fixing it. You'll probably be able to play this on the static recompilation though, if you really want. And you really need to figure out how to make this look. I kind of like the abyss look here. I think I want it to fade out to the top. I think I want it to fade out to the top. I don't know about the Riemann Hypothesis, that's a really difficult one.  I mean, if I really tried, I'd probably make some sort of advancements in mathematics, but I don't think I could do the Riemann Hypothesis. I don't know much about the MrFPGA, I just hear people talk about it all the time for some reason. Some guy claimed to have solved it after working on it for years, but I can't really tell if he was onto something or not. That's the beauty of really high level mathematics. If you're high level enough in mathematics, it just sounds like you're schizo-posting. So if you're just using hardware, this is very good at eliminating things accurately, because you can use this hardware on something that runs fast. He said he tried to contact Neurosis and stuff, but they had laughed him off. Okay, well that is very common with people claiming to make grandiose breakthroughs. Because most of the time, yeah, they kind of deserve to be laughed off. I think they're called crackpots. Hello Onion Kid, you are very late. There must be a reason for Einstein's hairstyle choice, of course he was schizo-posting. Oh, I see. Bro is just posting ads for the MrFPGA in my chat. Hence either that, or we create a higher, better intelligence than humans have. Which we can! I mean, AI of course is one attempt at that. But what I think the next step is, gene-engineered Chinese children. They're gonna break through everything. Just wait until they're grown up. They're gonna destroy all of us. Sonic the third, you mean the third Sonic movie? Kind of. The latter option sounds more believable. I actually think the latter option is just gonna actually come out soon. There's no way China is not trying to genetically engineer children. Like, I just don't believe it. Okay, this is kind of cool. This looks like it's a sea of monsters. I want more monsters in there. I want it to look more like a sea. I have a vision now. The first guy who did gene-editing on a person in China is in jail now. Oh, I see.     Well, maybe my theory is wrong. Alright, I think I'm feeling done for today. We did some good work today. Good progress. I still want to figure out the lights. We need to figure out the lights if we want to release the demo. Really, it's just kind of getting these rooms to look a little nicer. So it's not insulting to Biobak when I pass this over. I'll see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye!
