Oh, shit, one second. I forgot to put on my super epic shirt today. Second. Can you see it? You can see it?  hello Zayna hello Skyloft Sword, hello X-Links hello Mimosky hello Skyloft Sword hello Mimosky hello X-Links hello Mimo hello Skyloft Sword do you see my new shirt? currently trying to connect my... it may take up to two days for your product to appear in YouTube studio NOOOOO BangerShred, yes, we now have a new merch store on TeePublic but apparently it takes two days for it to connect dang it it's this shop here it is very short, like, it's true we also have a Rambos mug, they gave us a bunch of free stuff and they have much cheaper prices than Spreadshirt yes, this is a course 4 shirt, isn't that cool? we are going to make a design for every course with the course icon from the final game, and hopefully that's going to be cool as hell yes, Rambos jumpscare there is a Rambos shirt as well, or a Rambos sticker can't wait to not buy any... what? oops, let me just untangle this fuckery here and that's basically it    we're gonna get back to Biobak's rework of course too oh, right, we call it C10 hello, galameh, figarella there we go who would be pinging me? oh, I see hello, farplane, hello, teatime bonjour bonjour? that's the fact you're on your screen, that's part of overworld so, let's see, Biobak has sent me something is this a new changelog or is it just the old one? it is a new changelog, with a bunch of actor changes I think so I am going to copy all... what? the texture has too many colors again? we literally fixed this yesterday what? material 242 how can this be an issue? wait, we fixed this yesterday huh? nice shirt, thank you, thank you we fixed this yesterday, what the hell is going on? let's try that again hello, seymoursam let's just download all these files from Biobak while it's exporting F3D material 242 F3D material 242 how could this suddenly be broken? what the hell happened?  wait, that's a weird bug, right? something happened here, with the texture breaking that's not the normal texture that must be because we have two textures with the same name okay, this is fixable let's try that again this is going to take a little bit while that's taking, we can organize some stuff you guys will be happy to know that I fixed a bunch of annoying bugs just yesterday spent so much time debugging a lot of really annoying stuff is just gone now which is great I am slowly approaching zero engine bugs I actually got my entire compiler down to zero warnings as well I feel like I already did that before Saturday and already mentioned it but zero warnings? okay, your French is not amazing thank you thank you we fixed it we fixed the bug so I don't think I've ever showed this off properly in-game last time but it looks amazing in-game I can show you guys I had to make one change to the visuals Biobak because of an N64-only bug that you definitely can't see  and that's with the grass overhangs they have some z-clipping to them so what I had to do is make them actually hang over here so that this just kind of disappears there's the seam as far as I'm making the game only run 32-bit code there is no instance that I know of of non-32-bit code however I can't guarantee that there's an unknown one I guess GCC loves sneaking in 64-bit instructions for no reason so I don't see anything going on what the fuck do you guys think oh my god dude this looks so beautiful nice fucking nice oops there's something going on with the sand you think it's ugly? you're lying Lilaa just look at the water do you see the water Lila? do you see this 55fps with empty aliasing? I don't think you can even make the case that there's a better looking N64 game than this like anywhere in the world I think it's just untrue Lilaa you're so beautiful   Lilaa is indeed made of sugar she is made out of cotton candy and snowflake I do not want the kiss from the chef but thank you for the offer actually where I am there isn't much heat because I am in the basement Zeinas banished me here so yesterday I cleaned up a lot of the level I made it so that the thing is actors execute their code in order of what they're named in the level so I made it so that all actors of the same code have like similar names and that makes it so that we get a little bit of better cache proximity which is very good still no collision map do we do collision map first or do we import actors? actually I'm not doing the collision map first I'm importing the actors comprehensive changelog show me the waterfall in game please the waterfall was minigate again right? but I think it works man this actually just looks the same on N64 and emulator is it too slow? the top part looks so good Leela I don't do behavior processing I do tick functions so if you look at this this is actually something I've been working on recently I am removing a lot of moral64 behavior comments so you're jumping around doesn't matter you're only caching like 20 bytes of code like who cares this is crazy Leela I did a test recently because I wanted to check how expensive an ICache miss is and I did this by running code checking the cycle counter running more code like in the next 0x20 code block and I got a reading of 2 there's no way a cache misses 2 cycles turns out my game by itself is already so optimized that Mario's behavior loop never gets thrown out of cache which is fucking crazy let's see take ShyGuy another object take ShyGuy repeat no I go ShyGuy ShyGuy ShyGuy ShyGuy then another object just by ordering them right what do you mean I would not just be ShyGuys in order let's start with the big Josh you know what let's start by folder organizing I would like to save this over my old course 10 this can be deleted this can be deleted there we go entity component system you have to run code to figure out what to run for each object ok entity component system is complete garbage I can tell you that right now just jell the function you want to jell and then no that's not just possible with that you just need to order the actors correctly in memory what the fuck wait what is going on in this file is this a completely new Yoshi what the fuck is behavior in this context yes but Leela the behavior script unit is really small it doesn't really do anything I'm guessing this is the new Yoshi and this is the old Yoshi okay okay so I need to hook up the armature again does this have the tongue does not okay we added actor groups anyway I removed most of that what's the difference between having two Shy Guys instead of a Shy Guy and then whatever other actor Leela that's just not how instruction cache works anyway what OSDE do we listen to today any wishes Astro Bot Mr. Tongue No big deal. And then when I leave a page you have to start caching again. Nope. To me. I did not. Super Mario Galaxy OST. Let's do it. I don't want to listen to Mario Kart World 432 Hertz Super Mario Galaxy OST. This will heal our soul. Hey, so remember this is the body. That's the eyes and those two are support bones. I would assume that they want to know what cycle says and what I just talked about considering. I just talked about that. I got to get used to this new blender version. So that thing is almost everything. I see how it works. I made that thing almost everything. I feel like that's clearly not what I meant. What the fuck? What the fuck? How did that happen? I thought the whole point of aligning with the reds was to fit them into the eye cache pages. Yes, you align them into one continuous block and that way it is guaranteed that they will never overlap in instruction cache. If you don't put them all in one block, then you have to manually align all across your memory, which is basically impossible. I don't think there are pages. I'm not sure what a page is in this context, so I can't comment on that. Page is a chunk of data. Okay, so it's for two bytes a page. Like that's a chunk of data. What do you mean? This is not me being pedantic. This is me being like, what the fuck? You're talking to me too, so I don't think I'm going crazy. No, I always talk about it in terms of make sure to have like blocks of cache. Yep, all instructions on the MIPS are four bytes, but that's only in 64. That's not guaranteed like that on everything. First, making your architecture like that has some advantages and some disadvantages. Hash management is really not that complicated and people that tell you not to deal with cache blocks are evil. How is this painted now? There's no way dude. They must have changed something and how Blender vertex paints. What is going on? I am so confused. I'm upset. All right. Well, I think this is our Yoshi God. I feel like this is not the way it's meant to be. I think maybe we have to. Oh God. I think I'm very wrong here. The bottom bone is part of the tongue. And that one has everything. Okay, I see. This is the one that has everything. This one has nothing. I'm going to stick to long-term support version of Blender. Do you mean for example Blender 4.2.9 long-term support like I'm using right now? You're asking why I'm not sticking to the version I'm using literally right now. You sure you have a shot? You know, I'm like really strong, right? Then this one has everything else. So what was this bone here? That's a slower jaw. This one is his whole fucking tongue. That's just not true. What? Everything has his full. What? There's something so wrong with that that I don't understand this new Blender version. I'm just going to guess this is supposed to have the rest of his tongue. This is a slower jaw. I'm only six foot. That's reaching out now. It's like 30 centimeters at the end a little bit. It's one of those American units. What rest is a snowman's land? There's just missing vertex. Okay, that's easy enough. Now, I'm missing vertex. But they missed too many vertices. Hey, he exported. Let's see him in game. Well, this would certainly be an issue. This would be an issue. This would be an issue. No, it exported in the castle grounds. Oops. I'm going to delete those. Those extra exports. What are those textures? We don't want them. Let's try that again. Maybe. I've seen you paint with shadows over textures when editing levels. What is the technique you hold? Do you need shadow texture for triangle? Seems costly. It's vertex colors. There are no shadow textures. We are on the N64. N64 most certainly cannot do shadow textures unless you like multi-texture or something, but then like your UVs are very limited. Does Conker have shadow textures? I actually almost believe it. Shadow, uh, Conker would do stupid stuff like that. He exists, but not where he should be. And there are some minor color issues here. And where's his collision? There's a few questions I have. How the hell did that happen? I think I know what I did. What's wrong with the old Yoshi version anyway? Biobak made a nice out of it one. That's what's wrong with it. Yeah, let's see what's wrong with the mod detectors. Just as I suspected. Environment color? Ooh, we can't use environment color. There is a reason environment color is disabled. It's because of the Fast64 issue. So we always use primitive color when we can. So it's just a transparent language color which blends with the texture color value. It can be any color that you multiply with the texture value. So... I mean I can show it to you when we're in the level real quick. Like you see that? How the texture is like bright here and then gets darker here. It's just a linear interpolation. Or here we multiply with green and then on top we multiply with like a yellowish. That's really all there is to it. Yeah, so it mostly works but there's no collision. Doing it for source control and how often do you have to do that when you broke something? Couldn't figure out why. For source control I have git and I have never in my life broken something without being able to figure out what I broke. So I wouldn't know. I'm very good at just remembering my code. Okay, that seems to work. The only issue seems to be that he doesn't have interaction. And I can guarantee you when I go there it's gonna say OBJ list spawner instead of surface. What did I say? What the fuck did I say? Huh? I knew it. He's fixed. It's one of the split tongues. Wait, what's wrong? His mouth did clip a little bit low when he opened his mouth, right? I don't know which animation it is. Yeah. Yoshi got mouth open. Oh, the animation is missing. It broke.  Okay. Unfortunately, I have to make a slight model edit for that then. Something like that. That should fix him. Seems like a very efficient technique. Any idea why it's so rare to see in other games of the N64 era? If you look at something like Majora's Mask or any of the rare games, you should see it all over the place. Because it is a very efficient technique. The disadvantage is, you see, like, if Mario right here goes close to fire, how he, like, lights up slightly, you lose that effect. You can't multiply with shade color anymore. But for static level geometry like this, we can just bake the lighting right away, right? So it is just a strictly superior technique for static geometry without moving lights. You think you see animations? Yes, but I forgot it for that one animation. That's why it disappeared. So I'm fully aware of what went wrong. Don't worry. Hello, Rockstar. It is fortunately possible to retrieve the animation just from the hex values. But it is quite cumbersome. Eat the fruit, you idiot! Oh my god. That must be a scouting that I fucked up. Let's try that again. Pinky Eater. I only need apples that run at least at 15 miles an hour. What? I think he broke. I don't know how, but he broke. I did notice that he was talking to me twice, which was weird. So let's see if based on that info I can fix the bug. I didn't know I had to redo the entire thing. What if I'm stuck in a hole? They built a building around them. How can this get fucked up? I actually don't see it right now. Whatever, I'm sure we'll figure it out eventually. Not our priority for today. I will just go alphabetically. It's going to take the same amount of time regardless. Oops, I forgot to open this gate. Is there some change I made that made him get fucked up like that? He always talks twice now. Why did I do that? Is it because I changed his object list? If you want to fix something, please wait for me to be done with this part and I'm going to put it back on the github. Then you can just download it with my edits. I think that's the easiest way to do this. We're kind of threadlocked here. Okay, nice, nice, nice. Perfect. Okay. Okay.  That's fucked up code. I think there's something weird going on with him eating a shy guy. And with this flag. Okay, not a priority for now. I think his model is fine. So let's save this in the big folder. Ghost Black Plane. What is Black Plane for? Oh, the poochie section. Did you change it? Well, regardless of whether you changed it, I actually need to reimport it. Labyrinth Plane. Yeah, that's to repost settings. Save me some time there. That's funny that I put this on transparent intersecting. Okay. This asset is so likely to just work that I'm not even going to look at it. Is this? Oh, it's good. I guess this changed. This looks still as ugly as my old one. Oh. What? Okay, you don't have any specific notes for this. What do you want me to do with this? Do you want both? All of these were in the OG file. Airpoint. That looks a little more reasonable. Okay, do you want them to all be the same color or do you still want my primitive color multiplier? Because I multiply with primitive color to give them all a little bit of a different visual. Right? So the way I have it set up, it randomly picks a plane between this and like this. So they all look slightly different. I think I prefer that. Well, I can just change the colors to be greener. That's no issue. I also don't need to do this patching anymore. Because we now have automatic patching. Very cool. Thank you, f3dx3. Right, so if you want them to be greener, I can do something like this. How about something like this? Well, I'm sure you know exactly what I mean them to look like when I do this. Where is it? So f3dx3. TempoBush. TempoBush. GraphParameter. 110. That's to check out. Let me make sure it is 110. It is no longer 110. It's more like 184. However, that ends up being 184. That seems kind of big for what I'm seeing here. But let's try it out. Is that this one? Oops. Do I have to see it in-game? Yeah, don't worry. I'm going to show it to you in-game. And if you don't like it, we can change the color. I actually think this is going to be way too yellow now. Just from the values I gave it. But I tend not to change it too much either way. Well, actually, it's not completely terrible. It gives it a little bit of variation. There are some pretty strong black outlines on this, which might not be desirable. Easy fix. They're also a little high up in the sky. Okay. There is a reason I put them in the floor, so I think I'll move them down again. Just for the animation to look better. Are they supposed to be this bright? We'll see. I think not. Let's stick to yellow. And yellow adds a lot of brightness. You could fix the outlines, but you didn't. Okay, so you don't want the outlines fixed. Got it. Okay. Oh, yeah. Did I tell you guys about F3 2025? It will be happening this year. I'm thinking, since this is a sponsored event this time, we can hold a user vote. And the most popular game gets a cash reward on the day they release their game. As an additional motivation. I think that could work really well. Okay. There is less yellow. And you were asking for brightness variance, which is also very easy to implement. Let's add some brightness variance. So... Mmm... How about something like this? Tilting the bush towards the direction Mario is walking is supposed to make more physical sense. A little too bright, at most as bright as the grass. Got it. So in that case, I will just do 16 minus, actually 15, plus this, plus 7F, then maybe 192. Actually, I think the brightness difference is too large now. Let's do something like this. Eh. It does look a lot more bright. It's more colour instead of just green. If you add all the colours, you just get cloud vomit. Yeah, this is very pretty if you ask me. I like how they drop coins. They definitely need more of a sound, though. I want one more coin. Just one. There we go. Let's see what we have here. Uh... Can't delete that, right? C10, C10. Oh, we can delete this. Candy! Oh no, we need to go inside the Yoshi for this! So we do need to fix that bug real quick.  I see a minor UV mapping error here. Uh-oh. Problem is, I actually care enough to fix it. Sorry, I needed to... Oh, fuck! There's another one here! Wallpipe moment. No, no, no, no, no, no. I want to just fix the Yoshi real quick. Just two seconds. Just a quick bug fix. That's a treat. C10, that's not Color Vomit, that's Variation. Your carelessness for the art of manipulating colors disgusts me. I bet you think flowers look good. One and one. One and one. Two. Subaction two, action one. Subaction two, action one. Does that make any sense? Does this just happen too early? Something's clearly overwriting a subaction. I think I may have broken this flag at some point. Let's give it one more frame, just to see what happens. Please no screenshot. 30% performance? Yeah, it's basically perfect. 30. I would never do the donut tutorial. I didn't even do the donut tutorial when I first started. I started the donut tutorial because I was like, bro, you need to watch the donut tutorial. It's so good for planning up. And it was so slow and painful and agonizing. The object cutscene done is just not true. It's also nonsense anyway. It should just happen right after you're done talking to him. This does not need to exist. I mean, object cutscene done for one frame makes sense. And then talking to him makes it get undone. That makes sense. This must have been done when we had an older version of the engine that had some issues. I don't even need this. Let's do it like this. I think that we'll just fix him right up. Maybe we'll have a Yoshi dialogue moment. I'm fine with that. Do you have any ideas? I don't see any glaring issues with him. I think it's very effective in doing what it sets out to do. He still talks twice. Does he follow me now with his eyes? He does.  And talking twice is for sure an issue. Typical YouTube viewer experience. They always watch an early part of the stream. Okay, perfect. We fixed him enough to where we can go into him. That's all we needed. I still don't see how I can talk twice to you. Does that make any sense? I don't see how. Nope. Oh well, that's for later. I don't care about that right now. I don't know which C version I'm using. I know that's a newer version than what they used in Mario 64 under IDO. Because IDO fucking sucks and requires some really stupid things. But I'm also sure it's not the newest. Because I think in the newest version you are not allowed to declare variables in switch cases. And I do declare variables in switch cases. Okay, we might have to whip up a quick collision map for this one here unfortunately. I don't know what the fuck ANSI is. I make the games. I only know as much C as I need to know to manipulate the compiler to get me the assembly instructions I need. Anything after that is mental illness. You know the boomers that are like, there's only two genders, everything after that is a mental illness? I'm saying there's only two programming languages and that's assembly and high level. And anything after that is mental illness. Yeah, remain neutral, it's not the boomers, it's any reasonable person. He's saying every boomer is a reasonable person. Thank you for your input, leader. I will use this to slender you in Mario Gems. I know exactly what you're talking about, but I'm trolling you. Because I think that's a lot funnier. I'm going to jump as well, it is Yoshi. I'm going to jump as well, it is Yoshi. All right, I think we can get this to the amount of collision triangles the old map had. Okay, so the decal layer is with the opaque layer. That's something I try to avoid on my maps, but it should be fine. This area is catastrophic when it comes to textures. Oh, I know, there's tons of textures here and the sweets. I could tell right away. Oh, that's what they're called. Macaron? I thought Macaron was your president. Thank you for the input, chat. Is there a stop sign? See, I had a similar question last time we looked at this. And then Biobak linked a clip of a Yoshi eating a piece of a stop sign. And I was like, okay, fair enough, makes sense. Don't bring him into this. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that your president is so bad that he ruined chocolate treats for you. But honestly, he can't be that bad because we know what the French do when the politician gets too bad. If he was that bad, he wouldn't be alive anymore is what I'm saying. Ah. All right, looks good. Hello, Etheric. French people contain murder, maybe they're not a murderer at all. That's a measurement. Let's see, let's see. We have a fellow death supporter in chat. How is this so much fewer triangles than the previous one? Is it because of the kleptonaggies? Kind of sad we got rid of the kleptonaggies. The kleptonaggies, they were pretty good. Well, I guess what we save in polygons we make up for with textures. Waiter, waiter, more texture, please.  That's such a good piece on the melon. Every melon needs to have that. Why don't IRL melons have that? That makes fake melons look more real than real melons. I don't think I can just do that, actually. I think I might just have to bite the bullet and say, like, this is what you got. This is the collision. I had watermelon, like, just an hour ago, right before stream. Suck it. Hey, sucking on watermelon's not that bad. If you just bite into it, you're gonna get, like, all wet and dirty. Honestly, I have sympathy for that. Also, what if the watermelon's cold? Like, you're gonna bite into it and it's gonna hurt your teeth. Like, in that instance, I can understand watermelon sucking, too. So... See, I once said that a good... A good level... Looking at a good level has the same feeling as, like, biting into a stream of flowing water, like, from a water hose. And I think it's true. But when I said that, there was one guy in RHTC who was like, okay, so it feels like sucking a cock. And I'm like, no, it's not at all what it feels like. What are you talking about, bro? And basically, I'm saying eating a watermelon also feels like eating water from the hose. Who's with me? What are you talking about, bro? You know I'm synesthesia patient zero. How do you know? I didn't say this. The guy said it. It wasn't me who said it. It was the guy who said it. Eating water was like 97% of the way to drinking water. Yeah, but drinking water out of a hose is like 98% of the way to eating a watermelon. So you're drinking water out of a hose. I was like nine years old. Also, have you never drank water out of a hose? It's genuinely incredible. Okay, of course, it is not healthy for you. And of course, you're gonna get a bunch of dissolved microplastics in there. But I mean, it is incredible. Zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Drink hose water, you will get sick. It tastes good. Who will you trust? It does taste good. I'm just saying, man, if you can drink like milkshake from McDonald's, you can also drink the hose water. Okay, I think we agree on only animating this part here.  You know what, I don't want to sine wave the vertices now that I think about it. There's some microplastics in my chat. I didn't know you could overdose on them. It's called eating plastic. Oh, I see. Burger King or a milkshake. I've never been to Burger King in my life except for once when I was drunk and I ordered three burgers and I hated them and I just gave them away. They put mayonnaise on there. It was fucking disgusting. So we're gonna call nthcoloralpha. Why are we doing nthcoloralpha? This is a crazy one. Another slightly crazy one. Is nthcoloralpha anywhere you can remove it? I never use it. What the hell? It's everywhere. And it's always the alpha value. Bizarre. It is the default setting, yes. The default setting for some reason just does that. Okay, primitivecalalpha is actually used here.  Oh wait, never mind. It's a transparent repel my watermelon. Okay, does bacon go on burgers? Yes or no? Bacon is fine on burgers. Burger is super easy. You just take bread and you put salad and meat and then you put bread and it's perfect. I don't see what's wrong with mayo on burgers. Mayo is just disgusting. I don't eat condiments. How is that an insane burger? What? You're also the guy who eats the straw wrappers. Like you get a milkshake with a straw and a wrapper and then you like get the straw out of the wrapper and you eat the wrapper. Yeah, I don't think I trust your food opinions. Yes, tomato and lettuce. Well, not necessarily tomato but definitely lettuce. What's wrong with lettuce on a burger? Bread, sauce, meat, cheese. No sauce, please. Think about it. Okay, think about it just logically. If they wanted you to put sauce on the burger, then they wouldn't have made the burger like that. Because you eat the burger, you hold the burger and there's sauce in there. The sauce is going to drip down. You're going to get dirty. Yeah, I don't want to eat the burger in the shower naked. I want to eat it like on at the table. What do you mean? Onion is good in burger, too. You eat them in the shower? I mean with sauce, you have to eat them in the shower, right? So you can clean it off. You eat them without making a mess? Got it. So which of these textures should move around? This one or this one? They both look like they could move. I have never considered eating a burger naked in the shower. Galaxy brain moment. Yeah, you can eat it as much as you want. And you're not going to get dirty. It's beautiful. With the water on, of course. That's what the plastic wrap is for, so your burger doesn't get wet. So. All right, this should do what we want. And then while we're at it, we might as well export the donut. It's definitely not a test. That's definitely not a good name. So it's called donut. Bread, sausage and ketchup is a pathetic combination. True. Where's the crunch? Actually, I guess the sausage can have crunch, but still. Yo, this is the worst. Zeina does this all the time. She calls just the sausage a hot dog and I say there's no way that's right. Ooh, this looks banging. An apple? They really don't have any taste buds. Hey, did you roll this down here? It doesn't matter, it's still on mine. Get out. Oh. Slight issue on the donut. Minor issue, for sure. The fight still seems to work though, minus the donut rotation. Let's see what happened there. Where's your biscuit, Gray? Which biscuit's Gray? I didn't see it. I will see it next time, I think. I hope. Wear one in front of the chocolate. This one. Oh. Two textures in one cycle. Illegal operation. Easy fix. Okay, so this is the difference here. There also seems to be a size difference. Yeah, this new donut is a lot bigger. Okay. Scale is around 28%. We can work with that. That'll be well. You realize that you can only change your name every few months, right? You're going to be Aether the game for a long while. You know? Alright. Whatever you say, Mr. Gay. On the cookie that isn't sweet, you can just eat fucking bread. Just eat stale bread. Think about it. What's the difference between stale bread and a cookie that isn't sweet? The consistency is the same? The crumbleness is the same? The taste is the same? Sorry, I'm rage baiting again. It's not rage baiting, it's true. So this is the secret to make people agree with you. You just say some rage bait shit and then say you're rage baiting and people are going to yum them. Actually true. Loki has a point. You know what's on game? I mean, I never wound up. I think we've got this working as intended. When did I despawn? Oh, I see. Perfect. Hello, V-Turk. I mean, this is the second boss in the game. I'm fine with this being easy to avoid. But we can maybe make them a little more dangerous. Loki is still grey, but I think I just didn't reimport the level. It's a little weird, but I think, I don't know, it's whatever. Yeah, that's the old bugged out thing that we were talking about. Oh god, what's going on here? Did he say message? The shine on the edge of the pits looks very wrong. Let me take a look. I don't see anything wrong in the material. Let me take another look. The cost of moving is exaggerated. Let me take another look. I don't like the colours, they're too intense. I do agree, the colours do look a lot more intense in game than they do here. Let me take another look. Hmm. Hmm. I don't really see an issue here. Let me take another look. Oh, this is a good picture. Interesting. Hmm.  Okay, first 64 renders doing some nonsense. Interesting. I guess that kind of makes sense. Let me look at that in game one more time.  Yikes, what the fuck? Why is it so dark? Let me take another look. We're going to look at this in a more accurate graphic back-end. I think this might be an emulator bug. I don't think I've ever seen this bug in an emulator before, so I don't know. It might not be an emulator bug. Just wait for this to export, please. Okay. So what do you guys think of the shirt, the Return to Yoshi's Island shirt? I think we'll do one for each course. I think it could do pretty well. It is very cool. It is on Spreadshirt, but I'm not sure if you can just click it right now. Apparently it takes up to two days to link it. What's the intricacy in playing in the wrong area? No, it still does look weird. Interesting. Interesting. Interesting. It must just be due to the opacity, right? Is that old opacity not showing correctly? Why was the audio a little crusty? Because that's just because the emulator is not running at full speed because it's in debugging mode. Is Nintendo unsatisfied? True. I mean, I don't think their character looks anything like this. That question is so presumptuous that I cannot answer that question. Yeah, I think this is the best we can do for now, with this setup. It still looks good in my opinion. It is pretty strange. I mean, it's because Alpha doesn't look right in Blend now, right? I think your material just previewed a lot whiter than you wanted it to be.  Anyway, let's move on to the collapse floor. No longer collapses inside, slides to the side, hence the scratch marks. Oh, so you step on it and it just slides inside. I don't know what's going on here. I guess that's one good thing about F64 render, it tells us those right away. Why does F64 do that sometimes? When I click on one thing and then I move my mouse down, it moves to the next- Why?! It's forcing me to be so slow in my menuing. It's so annoying. It's so annoying. So annoying. So annoying. So annoying. So annoying. Where is the start warp for the Z rail? Wait, do we have one on each side and they just slide out? I see, I see, I see, I see. There we go. Oh. Hmm. How do I resolve this? I guess I need to import it twice. That sucks. And give away the hide point. Let's see what it's called. Hmm, egg escape. True? Maybe? Do you really know anything about egg escape? I can't scale by minus one on the same axis. That might be what I have to do. It's a little annoying, but I can do it.  Hmm. Temple trouble? Maybe? That might be a bit more descriptive too. Hmm. What else? Temple exploration. Something like stand tall on the pillars is near reference to the game and you'll be surprised when you get the eggs. Yeah, yeah. Stand tall on many pillars? I kind of like that. Fuck it, why not? I'm guessing this is the collision map. We don't need any of this stuff anymore. Hmm. Mirroring the collision is not going to be so simple. So it would be nice if the collision was mirrorable. Or, well, if the collision was just the same if it rotates. I guess I can just export two collisions, that's fine. Collision is a very cheap datalist, this is just a couple bytes. I hope that... I hope that the exporter doesn't back out on me. I'm actually going to push my stuff for now. Can I reach the bottom part? So just leave the top part. I don't like this part. Eh, no, fuck it, we're going to leave it. It's... This part, though, we can remove. Why is this part even modeled? Honestly, we don't need this in a model, right? Like, this will look literally the same. If you think about it. That's actually just invisible. We do, we do, wait, what? You can see it from below. I don't think you'll see it. I mean, yes, you'll have a camera view from this angle. But by that time, that will already be in the wall, most likely. The chances of you seeing that are so astronomically low. Like, it's just not going to happen. Let's just save those two triangles. This isn't a ceiling wall, it's another floor in the ceiling of the room below. Oh, okay, fine. Fine, fine, fine. Fine. Interesting. Weird. Oh, this is an I4, this might be hard to see. But we'll give it a try. I don't know, it should be fine. Okay, good. Okay, we'll move under the axis. Ah, wait, what? Wait, why is there egg gates here? Ah. Egg gates, why egg gates? Egg gates. I'm confused. Oh, did I, like, close? I think there's supposed to be a closing gate here. Is the model too high right there? The floor should be below the ceiling of the big room. Okay. Well, I need to find the model first of all. Because it clearly exists somewhere in here, but I'm not sure where. Is it this? That's it. So I think you want it to be about this height here. I think I get your vision, don't worry. Why does NVIDIA do this? When I hit Alt-R it just does that, I guess. It's annoying. I want it to stop. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. But that's fine. Okay. Okay. I'll just do that. And that should make that artwork. We don't need the collapse for to collision anymore. So that's a nice speed up. And nice room sync. Meow, meow, meow, meow. Come on. What the hell is going on? Open the file explorer, please. Oh my God, I can't open the file explorer.  Of course I've exported the geo. Wait, I actually cannot interact with the explorer anymore. What the fuck? I can't switch tabs. I can't switch tabs. Is my chat still there? Am I fucked? What is going on? Fucking Windows 11, I guess. Unironically, I probably did. Okay, I can go there like this. Weird. I can't click on my blender window anymore. Blender is gone. Did I do anything wrong? How is it me that this keeps happening to? Windows does this if you replug your mouse. What? How do I get out of this? I can open the task manager. I can right-click switch to task manager. Unplug the keyboard. Are you sure? I hear that once I unplug the keyboard, I can no longer interact with my computer at all. Okay. Well, all I got now is this. I have to switch Windows via task manager. If you can't right-click... No, I can right-click. The taskbar is not working anymore. And Explorer is not working anymore. Maybe I can restart the taskbar. Guys, it is not right-click that's not working. It's the taskbar that's broken. Really? All right, let's restart Windows Explorer. Hey, my taskbar works again. Yippee! No, guys, the taskbar was broken. I could not click anything in the taskbar. That's so dumb! Okay, there may be a few issues here. There may be more than one issue here. Okay, so I think, before we start trying to figure that out, we need to figure this out first. And I think, while we're at it, we're gonna make a collision map.   How do I tilt my beat? Okay, so let's make the collision map. It's a boring stream going. Look, I don't have a choice. If I want this to be playable at all, with everything moved around, I have to make a collision map. Can I continue making a level in the night cycle? Yes. Ah, fuck, my below. Wait, is this just opaque grass? I don't think that's gonna look right. I'm pretty sure this has to be opaque decal at least. It has to be transparent decal. What is this? Small grass? And then it's just nothing? Okay. Might be a Fast64 render bug. Yeah. Ooh, an eagle. What do you think was the most brilliant Markzware developer? It's not even close. And by a mile guys got it. I wouldn't call the other guys brilliant at all. Well, I guess there's people at SGI that knew what they were doing and they technically contributed to the Markzware 64, but like, yeah. You get the idea. Oh, I see, cool visual. Okay, so all the warp holes also moved. Okay, this is going to be a fair bit of work because everything here moved. No, it's very easy to make levels with Lambert. Guys, I think I'm going to finish this off stream. It's already 430. It is getting late. I think I'm going to be saying bye bye for today. So until next stream, bye bye.
