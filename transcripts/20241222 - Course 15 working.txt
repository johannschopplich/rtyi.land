Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.  Do you get a haircut? Yes. Is the mic muted? I hope not. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. I guess. Hello. I was getting the demo mostly released ready off stream. Hello, Skyloft. This is Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve. True. What's wrong with this? This is a perfect world for a demo. All right, let's get right into it. What? Okay, have fun doing that. I also got this mostly working off stream. No more visual bugs. Isn't that nice? Hello, Tyler. I'm going to play Shining Stars first. I'm just going to celebrate with the in-laws. Is it running better? It's running pretty well, I would say. I'm going to add the music at this level. Play with limited FPS. Limited FPS actually runs better. I think the absolute worst FPS you can get in this level is over here looking at everything. Let's see how bad it is. 22, 25. I think this is fine. Delfino will be a level in the demo, just as like a secret. I expect most people that play the demo to not unlock this level here. What do you mean my 20 looks bad? My 20 looks perfectly fine. It's really just how 20 FPS looks. What the fuck, Leela? You're crazy. Didn't expect that to crash. Cool. Did you guys see Malon's and Brodude's Kickstarter? They're actually making bank on this, which is crazy. I didn't think they'd make that much money. Although their most popular thing is already almost sold out. I don't know what's going to happen after this. This is like more than half their funding. Is there a release date for the demo? Nope. I'm surprised they're making that much money. That is actually crazy to me. Didn't think there was so much demand for N64-like games. To make a physical card, I would need the rights to Super Mario 64 first. I don't have them currently. Maybe next Christmas Nintendo will give them to me. I haven't watched Sonic 3 yet. I'm going to watch it tomorrow. Thank you for the 16th Sonic the Hedgehog. Super Nintendo 64? Very good. It is the best one for N64 development. If you're not an N64 developer and just want to play games, you can get the Chinese knockoff EverDrive though. What the fuck are you? Lila, you are being so schizophrenic today. Is something wrong? You have said the most insane things ever today. I've never seen you like this. He's not looking at the money. You're considering making an N64 game? I was actually considering using Recomp to make a game that runs on both N64 and real hardware at the same time before. I think that would actually go so hard. That would be dark. Just bundle Rs? I'm not bundling Rs. Yeah. I trust working with Wiseguy in the N64 Recomp a lot more than that. Besides, we would want there to be a difference between the Steam version and the N64 version. Any OST wishes for today? Well, you would want it to look as good as possible on Steam, Lila. And then, it also being an N64, it's just a marketing thing. What do you think of this carpenter that Zena made? Pretty cool, eh? Sonic Adventure 2 OST, you know what? No, Shadow the Hedgehog OST. It's too fitting today. I mean, I sense an opening medal. Yeah, we're probably not doing that. Just the carpet here is what we're doing for now. Do you think if I ever release my own N64 game on both N64 and Steam, Nintendo is going to hire programmers to look at my source code and make sure I didn't steal their code? That would be so funny. He did it with Dolphin? Really? But Dolphin was open-sourced, so it's a little different. He was going to pay them $20 a day for 100 years? Oh my god, that would actually be so expensive. Is there really many games coming out today? For the demo? I am at Aldi! I don't know what that means. Is this a safe space for Emily? Nintendo IP? There's a good chance I will, yes. I was thinking, okay, this is hypothetical and it might happen. What if, along with RTYI, I also release a game that is 90% the same content, but we replace all the Nintendo IP with our own? That is the idea. And that way we would legally own it. And I would maybe be able to use Recom to sell it on Steam or something. It's hypothetical. I don't know if I'm going to do it. I will have to see if there's interest for that and stuff like that. I already have a main character plant that I was going to use for my own IP, that I initially didn't want to reskin the game with, but maybe. Of course, I would change the movement and stuff like that too, so it would functionally be a different game. Right, but loses the limitation, they didn't try to sell that, right? Of course. There is some original Nintendo code left, but I am planning to replace it. Not even because I want to replace all the Nintendo code, just because the code is complete dog ass. If you look at some of this code, this code here on Nintendo's code was literally twice as many cycles, basically. And it's like, why is there 50% inefficiency in not even 8 lines of code? A lot of this they didn't have. A lot of this is stupid too. Why was there 50% inefficiency on 4 lines of code? Is there anything in the source slash engine except for extra engine stuff? Don't worry about it. Just rename them. The thing is, the DelibMotor connection right now is the upgraded code. The original code was even worse somehow, I don't know how. I don't know how you could possibly make it any worse. None of this code is readable. If you think this code is not readable, then it's just because you cannot read the assembly. This is literally a single for loop. If you can't read a for loop, then it's on you. This code here literally is just like, for i equals 0, i less than 0 to 0, i plus plus, invalidate, hash, index, i. Actually it's plus equals 0, it's too beautiful. It's dead. That is the code above. If you can't read that, it's a skill issue. How do you compile the cache instruction in C? Tell me. I think that's the answer. I think that's the answer. Releasing the standalone as its own IP will make it much easier to show and recommend the game to other people. Will make it much easier to show and recommend the game to other people? That's not true. You're actually right about that. People might be apprehensive about playing the Mario 64, or they might think that they need to be like tech nerds to even boot up a Mario 64. But if we just put it on Steam and you can get it for like 5 bucks, then easy. Is there a compiler I don't fucking know? I would do anything to avoid something like this low level. You need these low level functions. How are you going to send a task off to the RCP without writeback and validate cache all? It's impossible. You're too C high level brains to like... This is the operating system by the way. You're looking at operating system code. We need stuff like that. You can't avoid it. You need an operating system. I don't think there's an intrinsic for this. And what about this other version of the cache function? Or what about getting the value of the count register on CP0? How are you gonna get that in C? This one could probably be C, and I probably will turn this into CP. Actually, TLBPI has no idea how to compile that instruction. Hello, Alast. I am the Eggman that's who I am Hello, can I conquer Honka? Yeah, and I want to read this Sonic Adventure 2 battle on Xbox Thank you for the 10 bits I'm never gonna replay Sonic Adventure on the Gamecube after playing the Xbox version once dude I can't go back the Gamecube version I'm like a hundred percent sure has a bug where sometimes you just do the homing attack and it sucks like when you hold the a button it just happens sometimes I do want to play Sonic 06 sometime but I don't want to pay for Sonic 06 and Hila is the Eggman with the master plan what's the next guest a character tario stream when roblox paced me again the jr. search has the best graphics but the controls are meh PC in the best place to be having a lunch or whenever else so broken actually for Sonic Adventure 2 because probably because it was the first one I played I don't think it's actually but uh I just this is the first one I played Egg Woman with the work plan, true. It's alright, Layla. Oh, that song sucks. This is not edgy, this is just whiny. Please don't confuse edgy and whiny, I will be personally offended by that. The fuck? The front is vocal tracks? Nope. I don't like the delay when you do the spin attack in Sonic Adventure 2. That really does ruin the game a little bit. Sonic Adventure 1 Sonic feels so much more satisfying to control. But the chow garden in Sonic Adventure 2. I love Dolan games. I love freezing Cicada. Depilatory cream really does more like Rotten Eggs. Depilatory cream. Depilatory cream? The fuck? What are you on about? What is depilatory cream? Depilatory cream. The cream that makes hair fall off? Okay, well you would expect that cream to stink. It literally rots your hair, of course it stinks. Yo, Melon. Melon, I have to kick stuff to open here. It's going so well, isn't it? 16k? But you're out of this. Oh wait, nevermind, you increased it to 30. Smart move. Dude, I'm actually surprised you're making so much money already. Dude, are you just going to have an NPC room at the end of the game where it's full of backers? I feel like at this point you have to. I think it's up to you now. No ghost to bring you down. But there's nothing left to lose. You win. I'm your next up on the shelf. I need a guy with more than one C64. I didn't do that. That was one of the things I did. Dude, what the hell? Something doesn't make sense. It shouldn't be solid right now, but it is. Something's seriously wrong. There's no reason for it to be solid. Unless I didn't export this, but I'm pretty sure I exported this. You hate me, Unbridge? Why do you hate money? I love money. That looks so sick. You should look at the levels that are actually finished. I like the sound right here. This is how the whole game's gonna look. Look, you can run to Sam's and piss the people off. There's glass here? Fuck that glass. No ghost to bring you down. But there's nothing left to lose. You win. No ghost to bring you down. But there's nothing left to lose. You win. Come here! Come here! Oh no! No ghost to bring you down. God, 64 land feels like a different person, you know? There's nothing left to lose. Nothing to stop you now. No ghost to bring you down. Shadow and rails just goes hand in hand. You win. You win. So you send someone else getting an SGM, have you ever thought about getting an SGM or a system and you get your life you could find it cheap? No, what am I gonna do with it? I don't really see the point. I wonder if this is a random bug in the emulator. Kinda feels like it in the emulator. This emulator here is a lot more accurate. So it might actually work this way. Okay, nevermind. What is this? Wait, that is the wrong tile. Like a souvenir. Hm?  Hmm, compared to the OG game it's hard to compare. I would say a lot of the platforming is more difficult. But the movement is so much more consistent. And it just works. So it kinda balances out. So it's gonna kinda look more difficult, but not be more difficult. Does that make sense? I don't know. This is way beyond what this game does, I think. I like putting super hard things in my games. That you can only get at the very end. That most players wouldn't encounter. The problem with that is that a lot of the time players do encounter it. And then they're like, this sucks, this is way too difficult, I hate this game. So I wanna prevent that. What if I just say, fuck it, scroll both. And then one of them is gonna work for sure. Dude, what the fuck? It actually doesn't make any sense to me. Unless... Oh, it's gone here. Okay. The Slytech was made specifically because I knew that a level like in the Slytech was going to be in this game anyway. Otherwise I wouldn't have made the Slytech. Okay, let's try to understand why this is solid. What if I remove this? Is it still solid? Okay, so something is put in condition here. What the fuck? That was certainly an issue.  Is this bug fixed? That's a vanilla Mario 64 bug. I believe I fixed that. It's just how Mario 64 do be like. This is confusing because when I set the tile scroll here it worked fine. Let's try that for a second. I actually also don't remember fixing that last time. But I believe him. Dude, what? Is this bridge even ever visible? What? This bridge is never visible. So this whole time the bridge wasn't even visible for some reason. Huh? What? What's going on here? It's clearly visible here.  So it looks like texture 0 alpha is reported wrong. Why is texture 0 alpha reported wrong? Can we get a more accurate emulator here? They fixed it. This bug happens even in Mario 64. Just like the standard Mario 64 game. It is normal. Oh wait, he released a demo of it too? I had no idea he released a demo. I just know he released a game. Or he started a Kickstarter. Yeah, I've had this issue before. So, let's try an RGBA-16, I think this might actually work better, because the whole thing is black for some reason. Heh. Why can I not pull Texture Zero Alpha from here? It worked when I was on a level. I don't think I'm gonna play this. I'm not really one for demos. No, Toilet Duck, we don't have options for every random thing. Surely this is mostly because of the GXE Bib option, right? How does disabling that option make the whole thing way bigger? Hello, unknown. Oh, that wasn't it. Okay, I had this issue before with my other bridge, but the fact that it seems to work fine as long as it's not in-game makes me think this is a plus-64 bug somehow. Doing demos is a good way to get a lot of latest data, which is very important for making the game better. So I don't think you lose anything from doing a demo. There we go. This is what we wanted. Now it's finally rendering. What the hell? What? Interesting. Does it just go way too fast?  Eh? This is exactly going as intended. Is it just on the wrong side of the texture? There's no way, right? Okay. Heh. Personally, what I do is I send demos of the game just to one person and have them tested and I do that over and over and that works very well. I like getting feedback and improving the game, but that's basically just playtesting. Except I don't need a person. If we're being honest, that's what it is. Did we do that too? That's very good. Okay. What? Yeah, I imagine making the game run well on opponents that it would run even on N64 is a lot of extra work. It's like fine enough that it's 60 on the Steam Deck. 60 on Steam Deck is a good target. Anything more than that should be considered a luxury. Alright, that works. I don't like how suddenly it disappears, but I think it's because of the switch, not because of this. We need to remove the last megabyte of RAM used. What do you mean the last megabyte of RAM? Instant. Oh. Yeah, finding a full megabyte was definitely a nice surprise. Oh, that's perfect. Look at this. How it materializes. And then it does this. It slowly changes color. It turns dark and it disappears. Oh my God, that looks so good. Is the sun not emitting light on Mario? It is. It's just not as extreme as the sun looks. I tried to reduce the intensity of the sun, but it didn't work there for some reason. Hello, bad colonel. Lands first, there we go. Let's see what's wrong here. The lens flare was supposed to have a lower intensity. Endpoint F. Is it not multiplied by intensity anywhere? Huh? Well, it's used here in a different color. So surely if I set it to 1.0, it does something. Right? I'm going to try to pixelate the N64 emulator. Dude, let's go. Dude, it's still super intense. I don't like that. Why is it doing that? Am I pulling from the wrong lens figure? I don't think it's zero. Fuck it. Hello, Jonas. Okay, it's not working. It's not even close to working. The hell? I thought maybe they were setting the primitive color or something. This should make all the blobs invisible. They are invisible. Huh. Replacing it with zero works. When we do a code. But not when we do it on there. Unless. Unless. I have an idea what it could be. I know exactly what it is. I edited the wrong one. This is unbelievable. Because I made the levels in reverse order. There we go. We probably want this to be like 16 maybe. No, I was thinking we bring it back to the beginning of the game and we use the body brush for the icon here. This is a callback to previous course. I know it doesn't really fit course 15. But it's nice to remind the player that course 1 exists. Maybe this bridge should be longer. There should be a parameter to decide the length of this. Hello. Thanks. Links. How did I type in 64 and think it was going to be 100? I am too hexbrained. I am too hexbrained. By the way, what do you think of the carpet? I made this earlier today. I like it a lot. See a clayman? The event window spherical spring. Yep. It was impossible. But this looks pretty good. I didn't even know this was a song in Shadow the Hedgehog. That's a banger song. The cinema lobby carpet? True, it is the cinema lobby carpet. I was thinking of arcades. The background is more galaxy inspired. Yep, he says he here. It's like the downbeat from Smash Bros. Alright, what's the next object to program? Is the heart 15 or something? Or do you think that's a good number for this as well? I just think it's a good number as well. Let's progress. Done. Teleportation platforms that warp Mario with a cool animation. All right. That's my next mission. I think Super Mario 32 is a fitting title because I'm removing all the 64 bit instructions from this game and only using 32 bit ones. There are warp platforms. I'm thinking of a design for them. There's a lot of games with warp platforms. Let's not mix them up then. The hell? Warp hat? Yeah! There is some use for 64 bit instructions but most of the time 64 bit instructions were used. It was an accident that it made stuff worse. So yeah. I have this texture. Maybe warp hats should be the exact same size as this. It would be a problem wouldn't it? The switch was 1024 bit. I mean it makes sense, right? Nintendo 64 is 64 bit. The Gamecube is 128. The Wii is 256. The Wii U is 512 and the Switch is 1024. It only makes sense. The Miyoshi is in space? Possibly. I mean something like this could look kind of nice. But I don't think this is a good idea. It's actually crazy how with 74 backers they have $18,000. That's... wait what? 75? That's $250 per backer? Huh? The average person is dropping $250 on this? This is like insane data. I need to keep this in mind. Envmap in blue.png and it's yellow. Sonic Unleashed? Let me see those. I'm not sure what you're talking about unfortunately. This? Oh yeah that looks good. I like that. Something kind of like that could look very nice too. Hello Rozzy. I have no idea what you're talking about. But losing work sucks. Sonic Unleashed? That's crazy. I'm always surprised when I hear about people liking Sonic games. For me it's like there's very clearly two good ones and the rest is just... Hello Welser. Yeah it looks like personalized NPCs is just like the most OP Kickstarter strategy of all time. Then you limit it and then you increase the limit later. I don't know. Is that the one you developed and showed the shit on ender discord? You're in my discord Rozzy? I'm sorry if I'm missing something important. I don't remember any of this. The only people I see developing in my discord is the 3ds port. A pokemon stadium texture? I do have some pokemon stadium textures. But I'm not sure any of them are within that village. Probably shouldn't spend so much time on textures and stuff. Considering Biobak is reworking all my stuff anyway. I should just leave it to him. I'm using a plugin but I didn't develop this plugin. The plugin is called Fast64. Is it a virtual chat thing? Maya? Come on. Fuck Maya. Can't be going around telling people to use Maya. Out of all things. You're doing good, good. Not a Maya fan though. Blender is goated. Wait, Elise? Is this what I think it is? Let me check this. Just making sure. Yes, okay, this is Elise. What's Elise's name? Easy? Just making sure. Welcome to the stream. We're making a cool level. Look at this. Look at this bridge appearing. Isn't that cool? You wanna see the craziest thing ever? Look at this. I'm booting up my N64. You're not gonna believe this. As soon as my N64 boots. God, I hope I'm entering the right level. I did. You notice that one? Did you think this could run on the N64? Okay, ignore that 20 FPS on that one camera or something. It doesn't count. Give and call. Yeah, I mean, it's still like 40 FPS here, right? It's only like when you're looking at like the whole level and drops below 30 sometimes. Actually, it's fine here. If I limit it to 30, you're not gonna see as many frame drops. There are Mario 64 levels that are like worse than this. Oh, that's my capture card, I found it. Okay, enough time, pal. It was a crime. Oh, the game crashed. It's not very stable at the moment, but don't worry about that. It's fixable. Space area working now. What's missing? What's I need to do? This is a very early version of the area. Currently, we are programming all the objects that are in here and then we're gonna make the level. So basically everything is missing. So far, we only have some platforming pieces like the flipper pieces, the bumpers, some platforms, asteroids. Yeah, be sorry, I'm gonna put that in as a bonus level in the demo that I will release soon. I don't know when I'm gonna release the demo. It's probably not going to be for Christmas because Robot is releasing this for like Christmas and I don't want to ruin his release. Damn it. Where's your cool carpet? Your cool carpet is right here, Zeyna. Also loving the text. The text are good, aren't they? You wanna ask about them? Any questions? Thank you for the 47 months, Zeyna. So I'm gonna make this a warp platform. Basically, they're gonna be like the fading warps. When he stands still here, Mario's gonna spin and like go thin and dissolve into thin air and then appear somewhere else. I think the size is maybe a bit big. Alright, Ellie. Have fun with that. The baby's sleeping with you and working with you. That's good. Next, Eric Barone. Musician. Dude, I had the dumbest idea. I was thinking for the next SimpleFlips competition instead of making a real ROM egg. Because I found this random beat over Big Busan. I'm just gonna submit the most basic-ass vanilla Mario 64 object rearrangement with me rapping over Big Busan. I think it would be very funny. I have made a very cringe diss track against a speedrunner before, just like for fun. We both did it. Oh, I definitely could. I am going to make my own games eventually. I'm actually thinking of maybe this game here. I'm gonna asset swap a little bit of it and release it on Steam as well as my own game. Game music hit me up. Well, it would have to be in English. But it would be very funny to have you on that SimpleFlips thing if we do it. If the opportunity arises. If the joke is there. You're so dumb, dude. If we're doing it, I'll message you. Actually, there's someone else who wanted to text for it. He already has a shit ton of lines down. We just have to wait for the opportunity. It might take a year. It might take half a year. It might take a month. I don't know. But eventually the opportunity will be there and then I will DM you. All right, Ellie. That's awesome. Why am I using these fading warps? I did that before, Chris. The playable card. In 64 Land. Maybe in a different Remix too. I don't remember. Is Benita an emulator? Better you don't, there's recomp. That's the crazy part. Oh my god, I have to wait forever. What? What is this? Fading Warps in Area 1. I have not played Tonic Trouble, but I know of Tonic Trouble. Because UAD, a person I work with a lot, has played Tonic Trouble. And... We used some of those levels in some of the mods we've made together. I added a Fading Warp here? It's the most random secret of all time. Why did I do that? What the hell? Okay, well I like it. Yeah, basically. I mean, if we do that. I don't know that we'll do it. For now, just chill. So now we should have working Fading Warps. But I don't want them to just be Fading Warps. I want them to be... Hold on. Distorting, spinning, big animation warps. Okay, noted. I forgot about that. Okay. Why are you guys asking me so many questions? Where is natural conversation between people going? Can you guys not talk to each other? Can I not be a passive observer while I work? That would be awesome. Do you guys ever go somewhere and then people ask you, Hello, how are you doing? And you're like, I just got here. Why are you interrogating me? Why do you need to know this information? Or am I just too German for this? Yeah, you did that too? Good. So it's not just me. I thought that's like strictly a German thing. When Mario fades out, everything breaks. Sorry. I'm sorry for asking how you are. I've heard before of people complaining that Germans never greet them back. And then it turns out that their greeting is Hello, how are you? And it's like, bro, that's not a greeting. That's a question. Just say hello. And I will say hello back. But you're being a weirdo, requesting information like that. Like, what does it matter to you how I am? Sometimes humans care about other humans' well-being. You're so concerned about my well-being, that the first thing you ask when you see me is if I'm well? Do I seem that unstable? Imagine someone asks you, hello, how are you? And you answer, good, which phone do you have? Just as like a blanket response. Just like, that's how I feel. Imagine someone just asks you back, good, what phone do you have? And now you're feeling what I'm feeling. Or actually maybe more like, good, what did you have for lunch today? Something they need to like slightly think about first, before they can answer. Oh, but actually, on top of that, it's a question where you're not allowed to say the wrong answer. Because when someone asks you, hello, how are you? You have to say, good, how are you? You can't say, oh, actually, today was kind of a bad day. I woke up late, I was tired, I couldn't get to bed right yesterday because my sinuses were acting up. You can't do that. So there is like an inherent torture to the question. Because you are forcing the other person to like give you wrong information or make it really awkward. And like if you had a bad day, you have to kind of like avoid people. You don't want to lie to them. I'm fine. I have been worse. It's not a real question. It's just manners. Exactly. You can't say I've been really bad, actually. Terrible. How are you? I can try that. Okay. Let's figure out why when Mario enters the thing, everything works out. Oh, man, sorry to hear that. Yeah, but it's like, okay, well, I don't want your pity. What do you ask? Oh, my God, I can't believe the trauma dumping your bad sleep on me. Bro, you asked. Yeah, it sucks. Not a fan. Okay, I think actually my life would be easier if we disabled the ability of Mario to go transparent. Because the materials we have do not allow for it. And it's messing with Nth color. I think that is the correct thing. We also don't use Mario's transparency, so there's no point to it. Oh, what the hell? What is all this? And I wish it wasn't just a number.  Aha. This is the issue. That should fix it. So instead of this, I think we're going to use a scale animation where Mario just scales into the ground. Okay.  Okay. Let's see how this looks, if I did it right or not. That's good. I already have the next video in the factory, which is the... What's the video called? The genius, the N64's cache instruction. It's pretty cool. Then after that, I have an interview with the guy that's making the Mario 64 Game Boy Advance port. It's going to be a video about how that's done. Okay.  This song is a banger.  Here we go. That looks decent, I think. Hmm, not quite what I want. It's like the first 8 frames or so are too slow. Hmm. I don't think I want to stretch it more, because this is like a pre-made animation we have for objects that pop in. Okay. I think I also should remove this and only apply it here. The reason for that is that applying the flag causes some extra processing to take place, and we don't want that to happen. This should be fine now. What mark do I have left? The overworld and 2 or 5 side levels, I'm not sure yet. But most of the side levels will be pretty small. Perfect! I like this a lot. Now, I think this platform here should add a light from below, so that when you're on here, it looks like Mario is just being brightened up from the floor. This is directly editing the transformation matrix, yes, but... Okay, what the fuck was that? That was weird. Something's weird with fading marks. Oh well. Yeah, it's editing this transformation matrix at the object level, and we're just kind of interfacing with the engine. Which, at that point, yeah, everything gets added to the transformation matrix. So, maybe saying this is a transformation matrix effect is kind of like a nerdy, um, actually type thing. The engine is too goofy. It is, but I kind of have to do this, because if I don't do this, then we have to use transparency, and I don't want to re-enable transparency on Mario's model, because it would mess with all my components. So this is literally just the easier way of doing it for me right now. Uh, we've got to turn off our chameleons. I think that's all that we need. We can start, actually, I want the lights still. So for the light, I think I'm just going to use a custom collision type here. Then a texture animation. Very smart model in place in Google. I can. Hello, speedy Gwen, meow meow. Can the instance handle a lot of system, or is it too much for the CPU? It definitely can. But most of the time, lots are not really that good, because they mean additional code you run, which means additional instruction cache costs, which is... bad. 512 is a nice number, so we will do 512. RGB picker? Actually we don't need an RGB picker, we already picked our RGBs right here. FF8200. Now we should have nice lights when we are over those switches. Ah, whoops, I inverted this. And also, that made this thing really slippery. Does that make sense? Set to super easily climbable, but makes it slippery. Ah! That's a little bizarre. Used any 64-bit value sets? Probably on accident, yeah. Why is it so slippery? Did I maybe program it to be slippery somewhere else? I must have. Yep, right here. Can't believe I wrote code from literally half a year ago, with this random ass value. 64-bit instructions do not cost any, like... I mean, if you unnecessarily use them when you only need like 32 bits, you're gonna use and it can cost like an extra cashline to be loaded. But just the instruction by itself doesn't cost anything. Okay, yeah, the light looks really good. I like it a lot. And the goofiness is very fitting from R64. Yeah, I think we can consider that done. Now to the actual work. We need to somehow turn this into a fun gameplay. And it's not meant to be Portal 2, but I can see why you say Portal 2. It does look like Portal 2. Let me think about this again. So, we have this whole big area. There's static platforms here. There's the big arcade building, which is to walk into the middle. We have light beams shining out of it, and the light beams move around in a colorful and sure whatever. We have pixel arts of characters that light up with scrolling textures with Mario walking on them. Okay, we should work on it next. Hello, Andre. That's cool, yeah. I'm glad that my content is binge-watchable. That's very good, because that means people are going to watch it even years from now. Slide summary to go down the level. Okay, this is clearly not what we do. Let's keep this in the background here. Oh, yes, CRTs with GIFs on them around the casino would look so cool. Someone's testing phase. We are making the actors, so we can move them around. There's a fun level phase. Platforms, low gravity areas. Right, I still need to program that. We got the pinball pieces. God, this is going to be so difficult to actually plan out. We do want there to be eight red coins, mostly below the thing here. Let me just put a bunch of random platforms. And then we just throw whatever at it and see what's fun and what isn't. Persona 4 CRT, let's see a lot. Oh, kinda, just individual CRTs, maybe multiple ones at one place. Yeah, this is pretty close to what I want, actually. That's a pretty good inspiration for this. I think you got the idea. Let's program a low gravity area here. Let's see what happens. First, I make an outline of the things I want in the level. Then I think about how I can make the level fun in the way that I envision. And then I program all the stuff that I want for that. And then I just start moving it around and see what's fun. And then we just keep whatever turned out to be fun. And we discard what wasn't fun. And then we polish it up. So now we're in the phase of... Well, we're still programming a little bit. But then we're moving on to experimenting what fun platforming moves we can make with it. How we can make stuff feel consistent, stuff like that. I think there should be a larger gap between these. No, the rocket is static. That's going to be the inside room. Laser beam cage, kind of. Laser beam cage, kind of. Laser beam cage, kind of. I'm not sure what would be a good color to make this feel low gravity. I'm not sure what would be a good color to make this feel low gravity. Probably something like this. Probably something like this. I don't know what this means.   There's just instructions that move 64-bit registers around. Are the arses or meteors as long as it's going to squirt? Yes. It's going the wrong direction. Honestly, blue feels like a low gravity kind of color. Oh, that actually looks really good. I like this a lot. It needs to be faster, but I don't know that.  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  Alright, so now we just need to add the low gravity part, and then we're done. It should be easy, because we've run this before. Hello, unknown. Are you using room bindings? I don't even have room. And there we go. Low gravity's on. It's as simple as that. How cool is that? And now we can just put them wherever we want. Oh my god, it looks so good already. I like this one a lot. What else do we have planned? We don't have the claw machine. You can't just slow them down a little bit, unfortunately. Mario's animations are programmed to only run at 30. If you slow them down... I mean, you can interpolate them, but it would look really bad, and it would be expensive. When in doubt, unscramble my ads. Bye. What do I do with this ring? I only made this ring because I thought it looked cool. I have no idea what this is for. Do we make the player cannon shot through it? I think that would be cool. That would be fun. Beat boost? I don't think I want to do cannons. Oh, you can't just slow the animations down. There's technical reasons. I still need to make these platforms here look good somehow. I don't like the way this looks. I wanted this vibe. Yeah the ring might be purely decorational. Maybe we should do the decorational CRTs as well. We should, yeah, let's do those pieces first before we do anything. So, what's missing here? We got this, we got that. It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Ah! Did I not write down the CRT idea? Ah. Ah, yeah, here. Okay, give it it's own orientation and then I have to play a run around the ring to move it somewhere. That's not that easy. But that's also not what I want. Let me check the side of the gym room, it's made of gravel. I think it's the white, that's what I hate here. I also don't know if the green fits the level at all. I mean the green stands out nicely but I'm thinking maybe yellow is more appropriate. Or orange rubber, that's more of the... Yeah, it feels better. And then this, I feel like purple would be fitting for it. Maybe like a tube that goes through with, to make the platform float in the air. Definitely feels like it should be animated to me. Something kind of like that. Okay. A light source to that platform, maybe. But that's not the priority right now. I don't even know if that platform will be in the final game. We want to avoid doing unnecessary work when we can. This definitely makes the carpet feel nicer, but I hate the yellow. Yellow is so fucking ugly, oh my god. It's so ugly. I hate these platforms. Hello Epic Legends. It's good, we're trying to figure out this level here. We're trying to get the art style right and then also we're trying to make the actors for this level work. We just made the low gravity zone here. Dark blue, dark blue would completely blend with the background. I need to somehow make this not blend into the background. What's with the old lady water platforms? Yeah, I hate them. Ideally it would look like the arcade. R3D World Space, let's check that out. Not really. Interesting. Thank you for the five cats, Epic Legends. Merry Christmas from a Jew, keep up the good work. Thank you. I like your highlight that you are a Jew though. It's a little sus, is it not? Oh, I like the gold here. I think gold looks nice, maybe I should go for that. I think I'm going to put gold up here. Yeah, but it's like gold and red, it's a completely different vibe. It's like Canadian, I know, I know. It is very appreciated. Anarchist Jews that celebrate Christmas, I see. Don't you celebrate Hanukkah? Isn't that basically like the basic thing? Similar tradition. I feel like most people in Western society celebrate Christmas roughly the same. How do I want this to work? Yeah, that's what I thought. An election. Yeah. This is not how I envisioned this either. Yeah, that makes sense, Epic Legends. I'm pretty sure most Christian families also don't celebrate it as a Christian holiday, but rather just as like a capitalism holiday. Game design is tough. Um, no. Maybe. It's one of those things that's more difficult the more difficult the competition is, and video games are fucking awful, which means the competition is not very strong. I hate video games. Maybe any geometric stuff like those in a video game could make it look better. Geometric designs? What do you mean by that? I think it's just the color that's awful. I like the sides here because of how reflective they are, but it's just unrealistic to do that here. I mean, we could do an nth map. Maybe an nth map would look nice. Let me try something here. Bro has the mother picture. This is true. Bro does have the mother picture. I don't know. Hmm. Does that make me the ROM manager? No. ROM manager was not at the end of that point, but funnily I still had to use Object Importer, which made it so that it can't run on N64, unfortunately. I mean, this one platform here is not that bad. I don't hate it completely. Hmm. The game will be almost 64 megabytes. Like, I have 64 megabytes, I can use all of them. So I'm gonna use all of them to make the game better. Okay, this platform I do not hate. I think this is a passable looking platform. It's questionable whether we need the rim here. I think we don't. I think we can go with this and it might actually look better. Yeah, it's kinda nice. Do we need this rim here? Oh, that's the question. Okay, this feels a little shitty. Okay, I do not like this. I don't like this at all. I'm not using this texture, I'm just using it so I do the mapping. Hmm.  How do I... Wait, wait. Cool idea. Let me think about this for a second. Wait. Wait, let's not do this. Let's hide the air button. Nevermind. I'm probably distorting the texture a lot to make it look like a completely different effect. But this has a pretty cool vibe now. Will each of us get this in the final game? We have an overworld. Oh yeah, I like this. I think this is what we do. That's a cool way to make the carpet work. Very arcade-y. I'm just not sure about the yellow here. That might be swapped for a different color in the end. Music is so good. Final Haunt, Shadow the Hedgehog. Wait, Final Haunt? That's such a goofy name. I think I am done for today. We got most of this done. I just need to get a few more art pieces finished. And then we can start designing the platforming, which will be quite a bit of work. Because this is such a weird level to design the platform for. Some of it will be super easy, other parts will be super difficult. So yeah, until next stream. Bye!
