Hello, QBok, hello, the player Rolo, hello, the James L, Alinti. Did I miss the garbage lane arrows from the RTP? I did. Hello, Raider, hello, B-Truck. Did I be working on this level again? Hello, Rick, Luton. This is not the Sanx update, no. Hello, Maui. You guys figured out the progressing problem from before? What is the progressing problem? You guys, I played Mario and the Multiverse yesterday, and I recorded it, and I haven't uploaded it yet to YouTube. But please, please look at this. It's the Bombshell Bowling Girl. What the fuck have they done to her body? That's not what she looks like at all. There's no way the Bombshell Bowling Girl looks like that. You kidding me? Why? That's the most depressing interpretation of Bombshell Bowling Girl I've ever seen. Robot, you owe us, you have to make this up to us. Dude, Robot needs to fix this. I'm calling out Robot, dude, I'm posting this on twitter.com. He has to fix it. No, he can't make Bombshell Bowling Girl that hideous and think he gets away with it. I will not forgive Robot for wanting that. I don't like the aesthetic of this place this much. I think something's wrong. Um, I think we need to do way better than this. Something about this is just terrible. So most likely what will happen is that this is the casino. The theme is a space arcade, not casino. Um, so we have the ugly arcade carpet here. We have these floating meteor platforms and then we have all this glowing stuff. And I think the glowing stuff is kind of not good. I don't know, so crap max. Yeah, now you're proud of the stream. You get to be in someone else's replay. Needs more placeness. Yeah, definitely. Maybe we need to look at more arcades. I have no idea what MR6 Beta Tapes is. If anything, I shitpost about the beta because there's like so many small children interested in it and I think it's funny to shitpost about it. Uniform, maybe. First of all, we need an OST. Two types of glow media. I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that. An RGB glow and a purple gloom. Well, this is supposed to be a carpet, not really a glow. So maybe the problem is that the carpet looks like it's glowing. What if it did something like that? There is not a Pac-Man reference now. Oh, I see. Yeah, I don't know anything about the beta. I've never been interested in it. The thing is, the beta recreations are something that have been around since I started Mario 64 modding. And everyone working on it was, for some reason, there were like 15 beta recreations I've seen. Like people start and end. And I'm not over-exaggerating. And all of them have been around for a long time. And then, eventually, I find out, okay, for like 10 years, 15 different people have tried to recreate like, what, 8 stars? 8? Why? What the fuck are you guys doing? That's how I thought about it. Wind Waker OST? Sounds good. I think the darker carpet could maybe work better. I think the beta is interesting, it's like a novelty thing. But like, the novelty has worn off years ago. Okay, yeah, this carpet makes Mario definitely stand out a lot more, which I kinda like. But yeah, I think what we need to do is a more form follows function type approach. By the way, the RTYI demo is finished now. But there is a bug in Parallel Launcher that makes my ROM not boot. I'm currently trying to fix it together with the person maintaining Parallel Launcher. So hopefully I can release it on Parallel Launcher as well. So, how do we make this feel more like a form follows function? If this is an arcade, what are necessary things for it to have? Arcade machines. The next video will be about the cache, I don't think I will make a video about the demo. I will just quietly drop the demo. I do not offer personalized help, especially not with ROM Manager. If you ask in a help channel, I might chime in and help you. But there's no way I'm going to one-on-one talk to you and help you out. I don't mind helping people. But when you're in a one-to-one conversation and you're expected to help and answer questions, I find that very frustrating. Because I find often people don't get what I'm saying. And it's like I'd rather just dip out than keep going back and forth with questions. What about the space that have games playing on them? Yeah, I think that could add a lot. But I can also see that just like not really doing anything. Because like what function would that have? Can a ROM Manager make beta levels using SketchUp? And no, it's not imitating the beta, I guess. I don't know anything about those. The only beta recreation I've played was Mario Sans 1. And I turned Mario into Michael Jackson and made it spoopy. I miss Dudas videos. They're all gone now. This looks so cool. I think I want more of this vibe in here. Can I listen to the stage's background music? Is it available? If you look for Adobe on SoundCloud, I think he uploaded it there. Some more arcade and space station? A mix of both, space station and arcade. Maybe we should look at space stations too. These all look pretty cool. I think this is very cool. Maybe we should do something like that. Like a ring type thing. Maybe NeoVim. That sounds like a fun idea. What's his name? Badub. B-A-D-O-O-P. You're not stealing my space, are you? I'm not stealing the moon, but you're blowing up the moon-like structure in this level. Maybe we should do a ring. Is the airbox purple? Maybe? You're still in the game? Are you finished? If so, you can already add detail at the start. Yeah, there's going to be a big door here behind us. No, we're not adding detail before we don't have the basics. You have to go from the broadest thing down to the finest detail. So adding detail is the complete opposite of what we should do. That's a waste of time. Yeah. The problem with the ring is that the gameplay on an outer ring would absolutely suck. Because like... That's just not fun to walk across. Unless we made it so that there are sections you can't walk across. What if we used the steel beams? And we made a steel beam octagon around it. But like... in a zigzag pattern. Let me try that. Yes, I'm not B3313 either. I haven't played it yet. Actually. The thing is, I keep wanting to play it. But like, every time I want to play it... There's like 15 people telling me, you need to play this version, you need to play this version. And now I don't want to play any versions anymore. Yeah, Comet Observatory is kind of the vibe I want to go for. Maybe we should look at that more. This is literally exactly what we want. They have a Minecraft version of it. But it doesn't feel very placey right now. What the heck are these? Gum roots. Okay. You're still going to be targeting on console? Are you going to go for 60 with the latest improvement? Or are you going to... No. We are going to go for 30 on console. 60 on console is just unreasonable. Okay. It's a function of the giant rocket in the middle. That's the arcade. That's the inside of the arcade. A terrible Disney song. Let me see. I don't know any Disney songs. Except for Let It Go. I'm no pro at Disney. Yeah, the target FPS is 30. So there's going to be a bunch of areas that run way worse than the benchmarking area. I don't know. I'm going to join World G.I.R. and Disney song lyrics. Brother. Why can they not just do proper English? I don't know. Apparently it's like a bunch of all your quotes in Cosmark. Or does it get thrown away basically? There will still be use cases for my sine cosine stuff. But you are correct that most of it will get thrown away. Or well... Not most of it will get thrown away. But rather most of the use case disappears. So it's still good to have the fastest sine cosine. It's just much less relevant now. Do you have camera issues? I mean do you see any camera issues when you play my game? That feels like a very subjective question. I have a completely custom camera. But whether you think it's better or not, that camera is going to depend on you. Not on me. I don't like the floating TVs. I was going to play GIFs of old advertisements on them. I don't know if that makes it better or worse for you. Hmm. How come these don't line up at all? What do I got to do? What do I got to do? What if I lined up this corner here? This edge. And then everything else stuck around it. That feels like the most reasonable way of handling this. How about you playing GIFs? You're taking a GIF and you're playing a... I don't know what you mean. Where's the confusion? For me to be able to answer your question, I first need to understand what your question really is. What your knowledge base is. If I don't have your knowledge base, I can't possibly answer the question, right? It's like the question with most things. Because if I assume you have no knowledge at all, I first have to explain how electrical circuits work. And I'm not doing that. The name right now is Astrologate. What is this number, 1 divided by 32? That's not 1 divided by 32! It has to be close to a number, 1 by 24? Yeah, that seems about right. This doesn't line up at all. Um, the idea is mostly that it's little pieces floating around. So in the alien would be a bunch of platforms floating around, and you would be able to walk around here. And from there, you would be able to like, go to big arcade attractions. You know what, I can just rotate this. Why wouldn't I just rotate this? I'm sure it's kind of misaligned on this piece though. That's not what I meant to do. I'm going to move it kind of like so, 120 coordinates. Yeah, we can't see that at all. It's fine. What about an UFO? We have UFOs here. I can show you. Would you rather have those beams be the corners that connect the two shapes? You mean that there would be like a 22.5 degree cut in those corners? And those beams here? Wait, where's the rest? And why is this one so misaligned? Oh, that's probably why the other one was so misaligned, because they're both super misaligned. I see, I see, I see. But I think that structure around here is going to give this a lot of structure and make the level feel more like a place. And I forgot to show you the UFO. I remember this being 121 coordinates, but I guess it wasn't. It's okay, we can touch it every so slightly. This is fine. I am not sure why these other ones are not appearing. That seems like a fast 64 buck to me. I think the level is too dark. That is crazy talk to me. I mean, maybe right now pieces of it look pretty dark. But like, there's going to be a lot more lights around. Okay, and this is kind of how I had envisioned that, with the steel beams going all around. We're gonna have to remove some of the steel beams from the inside. And I think that gives this a lot more structure. I don't like these glowing staircases. I think we need to make sure that any floor Mario walks on is not too bright, so that we still have a lot of contrast with Mario and the player can always easily make out where Mario is. I did create one corner in mirror. Hello, Sio. Oh, well, it is rotated. It's radial symmetry. And it does all line up. The thing where it became an issue is because we have one thing with three sides and then one other shape with eight sides, and that made things a little weird. It does feel pretty cool to walk on these steel beams. I am enjoying this. But it needs to feel more like a space station arcade-type thing. One YouTube commenter, or many YouTube commenters on my case computer said that it feels like there's too much random stuff going on. I mean, it definitely looks like there's way too much random stuff going on. A lot of the random stuff going on is not even part of the level. It's just part of my actor testing. But it is one thing to keep in mind. And I do think this level requires some structure. The problem is, I want to give the structure without making it predictable and boring. But I also want the platforming around the middle to not feel like a chore. I think it's good looking. I think it looks like ass. That's weird. Usually it's the person making the thing overestimating it. I do like the meteor platforms. I really, really hate these staircases here. But yeah, I need to think of a way to make platforming around the middle here not difficult. But also not a chore. But also feel like it has a lot of structure to it. So, that's something. Hmm. So, this whole side here is basically garbage, I think. I do like this part here with the teleporter. The teleporter out into the wild is good, I think. Low gravity zones, I think, are good too. But I think the way the low gravity zones are implemented is kind of bad. Or rather, the way they're used. What if we made a low gravity zone entirely around the planet here? Should I even use the planet yet? To put weight on the Saturn 27? Yeah. I might do that still. I just recently switched them from not being slippery to being very climbable. And of course, while they were slippery, making them bouncy would have tragic consequences. Like, I think the bridge here shouldn't exist. That shouldn't be a thing here. Also, this of course is bad, I think. Hmm. I think we need a new staircase design here. But we want to keep the staircases. Let's think about how to make the staircases decent. Change them? I mean, yes, that's the idea. Hmm. No questions, why don't we change them too? I do like the wobbly side thing here. Maybe the middle should just be carpet. But not like arcade carpet. Something more space stationary. Gravity zones should be connected to something. It's kind of weird with them just being there. You're right, that is kind of weird. There could be like an outline down there. I also think this whole structure here shouldn't be as well lit as it is. Changing how well lit this is is going to change the entire vibe of this. Something like that. And then we can still attach lights to it and lit those parts up separately. I think that will work well. Now what to do for the stairs? Do we even want the stairs? The problem is, I have too few types of platforms. I feel like I don't have enough things to really make something. And it really has to feel more like an arcade. Maybe I do need to look at more arcades and see what they have. One thing I notice here is all the posters. I wonder if they had floating ads for arcade games. We already have the floating TVs for that. A cabin with inlaid lights would look space station-like. Something like this here. Except darker. I think we need more of an arcade feeling. The problem is that these machines here suck. They give us arcade points, but they take away gameplay points. I think we might need to make big versions of them. And then turn those into platforms. Let's see. What can we put? Donkey Kong, Pac-Man and Tetris? That's three. Three should be enough. How do we turn them into platforms? Hmm. Make a very simple Donkey Kong game. Then we can make the platforms come out of the screen and the player can walk across the screen. Random idea. Skee-Ball. Skee-Ball. Do I even want these arcade machines though? I don't know. This feels so retro and I don't really like it. Pinball.  Oh, that's pinball. Well, no. The pinball machine is already over the entire stage. We have the pinball pieces everywhere. They're going to be under the main stage. So you're going to jump down into the red coin area while you walk around the main area. Satellites do well, I think. Planets are fine, but nothing here. Screams Arcade. Maybe Arcade is just a bad idea. Shit. I don't know.   Oh. Oh, right. The light games. No, I don't want retro games. Hello, Hoisel. Welcome to trying to make sense out of this. I think we might just need to commit to some arcade games. But maybe Arcade is just not it. Maybe that's just not the way this should be handled. Maybe just Space Station is what we want. Then... I think there's a little bit of a confusion where people think Arcade means retro games. And I'm thinking Arcade means the games where you get points. Like physical skill type games. Man, this felt like such an easy level to make, but it's so difficult to make this good. I don't know Laceration. I don't know. We'll have to test it. I don't have a European N64. It just doesn't have the placeness is the issue. Identity Crisis is right. How do I just print for one specific game with a directly connected input system and the shell has to be the size of a standing average male? Uh-huh. Yeah, that sounds about right. Sketch the layout that feels more Space Station-like. Oh, mostly solid rings. Random structures and broken sections. The rings, non-triangular rings. Mm-hmm.  Ring and keep the other ones. I see. So you're also thinking rings. Which is kind of what I did here. Instead of breaking them, I just made it so you can't realistically go up here. I think that works too. The problem I have with that is that like platforming on the other side would be very boring, but maybe I am overreacting there. Maybe that just isn't the issue I'm thinking of this. Maybe we should just have the arcade carpet be around the entire Space Station once. And then we can still go outward like that. The problem I have with that again, though, is that it feels very much like, okay, here's three linear paths, go down them. That's not the Mario 64 spirit to me. What even was I thinking here? I think I'm forcing this too much. Player arcade games and really need to get a star yeah but that's that's just not the mar 64 gameplay right that's like oh you like mar 64 go play a different game i i don't want to do that that's like a donkey 64 thing of course there will be an alpha layout the initial plan was that there would be teleports around here or not just teleports but rather entrances into linear paths and these linear paths would go all over the level but not intersect each other that way it would be very linear but feel somewhat open that was the hope the problem is we have to somehow hide that these are like openings to linear sections somehow so you don't feel like you are stuck in a linear level what if you just say fuck it this sucks what if you say no not arcade machines something else the machines are bad we don't need a new idea for every star we can literally just be like the star is the platforming right we don't need like platforming and then there's another thing i think this thing the end of the platforming just makes it worse so you finally done one planet thing on the side thing yes that's true and that's typically also how i make my levels most of the time and course one has the the city climb course two i guess course two doesn't funnel you as much than one path and more like very open because three has to wear white rash course four has um the vario jail thing course five is multiple paths that you randomly pick and they're not basically funneled into one course six to open for that course seven also has like two paths you can go down crusade has one yeah i think we're doing fine in that regard i think it just sucks that this is happening i don't like this i think that's that's where my ground issue is with this it just is not fun there's something in help from those levels i think rainbow right is the closest to this so don't i don't know gravity and you need to risk some height to get it yes that's doable but no we put there would need to be something to change gravity like it would need to make like story sense and i don't want a story in this level i want this to be just platforming fun we only have a star to like that i think the problem is we're pushing the arcade theme too much and like no matter how we implement the arcade theme it's not gonna be fun the flippers and everything like that is fine though i think we need a different secondary theme hello pablo well what about the action have you done anything for that yet no there's nothing inside yet and inside this arcade i don't know it just feels like we have two different non-related levels hello tanya i promise a lot in a sec yes yes you can go into the rocket that is that is the whole purpose of the rocket the rocket is the arcade games do you have so far we wrote down pack mario we had like a tetris thing we had the rhythm game area with a whack-a-mole thing and then we had like a bunch of gate stuff and stuff and we had skidball but pack mario is not fun tetris is not fun skidball is not fun rhythm game is not fun whack-a-mole is not fun all of this sucks i i don't think i want to do that i think if this concept is separate yes that would be easier but we're losing the placeness we're losing all the placeness here i think we need something different entirely i still like the gameplay idea here of this being like a very free movement form like mario galaxy type deal that we somewhat try to make feel not linear so i don't know standard from mario world never played mario world isn't it just a bunch of difficult levels okay guys we're not putting random other games in here for no reason what are these suggestions the tvs look really good to me i never exported the darker outside i think we just need a different theme an alien infested space station or or you know how we have space time yoshi and this ufo when you save state this could be where he lives a galaxy level we can use i kind of actively want to avoid looking at galaxy while making this because i don't want to accidentally like copy galaxy here do not colony mario can eat let's see  oh it's like a thing on the moon so no we're not doing another balls of him thing so i mean a secret koopa society in space would be very fun it could be better we can build like spacey looking houses and then you just climb between the houses or something we can still have the rocket in the middle and then it's like full of alien bowser enemies i think that has more potential and will be a lot easier to pull off it also gives us more platforms to work with i guess it's always easier to work with something when it has a function and it's not like an arbitrary thing oh right that would have to be a shy guy space shuttle because we're yoshi's island yeah definitely like that's why i'm not hesitant to like just retheme this  abandoning the arcade idea and going for a space colony so the satellites make sense with that those floating platforms maybe not so much the planets are fine the asteroids are definitely fine shit but space colony is just sonic adventure again i keep referencing sonic adventure unintentionally the sonic adventure is the space colony arc oh we're gonna space war is on between shy guys and yoshi's i don't think i want to put yoshi's here i think i want to put shy guys there's only a few stars where you have to chase someone i don't want to overdo it or it's mostly yoshi coins i wouldn't add octogoombas i would add like space shy guys that we just make up because it's yoshi's island i'm just thinking about a space colony what potential is there i mean he has houses also enemies since it's space we can just make up whatever we want spacey piranha plants how do we make it pure platforming without it sucking though we can have those rings we can add houses between stuff we can send the player on paths but i guess the paths also need to like go into black holes so we have separate areas because we have physical limits to how big the world can be yeah the middle would be like the shy guys base and you would be infiltrating it the rocket will be the shy guys spaceship so that would be a much easier start to pull off than the arcade thing i guess i'm at space i'm super paper mario which one's that there's a bunch of fuckers in the base level which fuckers are we talking about here this oh i guess floating floating jellyfish would look really cool i like jellyfish especially because everything's so glowy here or like squids could be a boss fight like that for free that'd be the easiest boss fight ever i can definitely program a switch that changes the way the gravity zones work more than two let me see that it doesn't look like too much what do we call this shy guy space so we're not programming random other games in here like i said that's a donkey kong 64 thing and it sucked we're not gonna be like oh you like 3d platformers well fuck you go play pac-man or some shit shy guy space shuttle sky sky station oh i like that yeah shy sky station or sky shy station remember we have a shag i think level in rty we do but it's yoshi's island yoshi's island is full of shy guys it's kind of on purpose so yeah and this being like a shy guy space civilization also adds a lot of placeness to it makes it feel like something real what do we do on the tvs what do we put on there so i can make gifts play on there okay let's see what this is let's let's see what we can do um so the 8 bit pipe to mario 64 stays the 8 red coins around the flipper pieces i think that stays um so one that's obviously all the game machines suck that's also doable i think it'd be funnier to like show videos of mario killing shy guys as in like that's the enemy like what if what if it was like a newscast and the newscast was like a recording of mario killing shy guys so like space guys saying space things like it could be a space guy talking and like the button text is just weird symbols and then a video of mario killing a shy guy in slow motion and like the video turns red and then the crt effect happens and the shy guy is repeating it space anti-mario propaganda yeah let me let me read okay because i told him to do a thing i guess he doesn't need to do it then  marcot a live video of the gameplay yeah i don't want to do that um maybe no i think i want them to be aliens let's see they're taller shy guys i like that the weird guys at the end of twilight princess like that but with shy guys where they are like a bunch of different things hello tyler mcvicker merry late christmas yeah i'm thinking that mr q um can you explain why he was married hitling aliens um so hello mr vicar thank you thank you that you enjoy my work welcome to desperately trying to make this level fun and like realizing we can't make this theme fun and instead going with a completely different theme no this is a shy guy space station but something really well or something from super mario galaxy um maybe i'm not sure i think i want piranha planter too so so we built a bunch of weird looking houses here for spacing within houses glass rooftops and maybe shy guy living rooms inside that could be really funny if we had space houses and you could like look into them and you would see like shy guys in their living room in there no this is not bowser funded at all it's completely separate from bowser they all speak an alien language bowser gets his income from being an oil tycoon i don't know if you've seen the level but this is the most evil incarnation of bowser yet because he is a ruthless capitalist who owns an oil rig with a giant statue of himself in the middle yeah look at this set of cements and then you mess it up and now he's gonna he now he's gonna get uh talk with the big boss bowser oh never mind he doesn't complain about bowser being mean to him god this looks so good look at the bowser statue in the middle this goes so So hard. Thank you for the 2 Euros Ice Place. Hopefully more people talk about the fake takedown. Yeah, someone actually DM'd me about it yesterday. They heard about it on the news. Okay, so we have our Shy Guy houses. Naturally, what's to happen is you need to be able to enter one of the houses for one of the stars, right? I mean, pointing outside the box, I have probably like 800, 700, maybe 600, maybe 500. More than 400 for sure though. There could be long tube-shaped houses. Maybe the way to go to another area would be like a cannon, to like a tube-shaped house and then you can go inside. I guess I'm thinking of Mad Space again. I keep going back to Sonic Adventure 2. I can't stop doing it. Yeah, I was thinking a shape like that. But I think a shape like this also exists in my galaxy. This is level 15. So it's the last one. They spoke Latin for no reason. I was gonna have them be incomprehensible. 1930s technology. That sounds cool though. I kind of like that. Well, why are we doing 1930s? Why not 1920s? Just because 1930s is kind of a bad time in history. Or maybe like 1960s because that's when the moon landing was. Doesn't look as iconic. What do we have for the 1950s? Either way, I like the idea of using old technology. For old technology, what would you use? Like a gramophone? 1920s technology. Let's see what we have. Oh yeah, television. CRTs. Of course. Of course. An old telephone. Sure. Old cars? I don't think old cars work because we're in space. Retrofuturist. Late 40s. Early 50s. I'm not familiar with that. I don't want to just put oversized versions of these here though. We can have old planes. What would old planes look like? Yeah, we can have this to go like between areas. So we have the Shy Guy space rocket for sure. And then the rest seems to be just platforming, right? I do want to avoid any WWII connotations with this level. So yeah, if technology was specifically only relevant during WWII, we would probably exclude that. But I don't think anything like that happens. Why Sethbot? I don't understand. What's the e-stack here? Do you mean like as a reference to the title screen in Mario 64? Discman instead of Thing? Hmm. What do you do in this level though? Do you just like become a general nuisance? No story to this? Radios. Sure, radios are old. Is Tyler McVicar famous, VTARC? Do I have famous person in chat? I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with culture. Freeing Shy Guys from mind control? No, they're evil. The Shy Guys are explicitly evil. Or they're more like a force of nature than scheming, I guess. So we definitely want like a cannon to a different area. Maybe they have like crop areas too. They grow crops in space, yeah? They should. Crops in space. Has anyone done this before? Yeah, I specifically wanted sci-fi interpretation of this. This looks cool. So, um... Planting a crop plantation in the greenlands. We can do lots of stuff with that. Will that place ever be based off a real one? Like from the 60s? Yeah, so I'm thinking the way this works is... The Shy Guys somehow sometime in the past established a settlement in space. And that's why all the technology is old. I don't think I'm gonna make their rocket look very realistic. But I do want it to feel like, okay, they got here 60 years ago. And they're chilling. And like they're living with the tech from 60 years ago. The Martian? Let me see that. Okay. Oh, is that what they're doing? I see. I probably will do a much more sci-fi approach. Where it's like, maybe there's like glass above it. We have a boss fight planned already? Could use it as motivation for Mario wanting to stop these Shy Guys? No, but I'm thinking I also want giant space squids. Giant space squids. Does that exist? Did someone make this before? I want it to be bioluminescent. That's not how I saw that. Make bioluminescent space squids. And that could be the boss fight. But do they have trees and plants up there? Or should it all look depressing, eerie and dark like? I'm thinking they have one specific plantation. Where it's like full of crops. And that's what they eat. That does sound like a fun time. I like movies that have like a fun premise. More than movies that have like relatable characters or stuff. I can never relate to any character anyway. So there's a bioluminescent space squid in space. And this space squid has a fight with us in space. How can I make this fight work? Like a field of asteroids. And you jump from asteroid to asteroid. And like hits the one you're on. And like that's your timer. And maybe you have to like climb towards it. And like kick it in the face or something. I think that would be really cool. Wait, what does boss fight mean? Would it just randomly appear? Would you just walk to some corner of this level and then have the boss fight there? We wanna make this level work in a way where... There is one mission at first that you gotta do. And then you like have an overview of the level. I think I kinda want that. I think that should happen first. Why is Mario speaking with these guys? There has to be a reason. They're shy guys. They saw Mario kill all the other shy guys. At this point in the game you've killed so many shy guys. They know you're the enemy. What would godlike space squid ink do? Oh, I don't think I want to program ink. Just because... A volume like that is like really, really difficult to deal with. Programming wise. I think if you had to fight the space squid first before anything happens, that would be very good. What if the space squid was out and about and all the shy guys were just in their houses? Scared of the space squid so you can't enter anything else. And while you walk towards the space squid, you get a big overview of the level. And you know where else to go. Because the shy guy space rocket is going to have a star at the very top of the screen. Yo, thank you for the donation. Woah, woah, woah, wait, what? Did I miss that? I saw a very big number pop up for a second. Wait, am I crazy? Yo, 500, holy shit. Thank you very much. That is extremely appreciated. Check the emger you posted. Well, thank you very much. I'm very happy about that. Moonguy. Is Moonguy taller than the shy guy? Yeah, that's a fun way of doing it. But I don't know what was happening on Earth. Yeah, yeah, this is exactly what I was thinking. I will save this link here. Well, it's 500 euros. It's translated to 521 dollars. So that's very, very cool. Hehe. Yeah, and they would be called Sky Guys, but you probably wouldn't be referred to by name. That you could fund your next game. True, 500 bucks. That could get me like... Solid 2D platformer on scratch.io. For 500, maybe they'll even pull out Photoshop out of MS Paint. But no, the money is very appreciated. I do put a lot of the money I get donated back into the game. Gotta pay a Biobak for his work on here. Hopefully I can pay the musicians too. I actually have crazy plans to maybe, hopefully, somehow monetize this game. And if that happens, we're going crazy. Check the YouTube link. Let me see that. Somebody asked if it's possible. I'm not programming planetary gravity for this level. I do still work for Gears of War Breakfast, yeah. Takes a lot of my time. Yes, so I'm thinking Star 1. The big bioluminescent space squid is around and everyone's scared. And the TVs show the space squid in like danger triangles. The space station is locked. And you have to climb through the level to the space squid. Kill it. And then everything else in the level unlocks. Yes, Tyler. That would be one of the ideas that would work best, I think. I would have to pay Badub out for the rights to the music or something. But then, yes. I could even put the music on the cartridge and then put that out. I'm actually not sure, Tyler. That's something I definitely will talk to a copyright lawyer about.  So the crop plantation, maybe you can't get to it because everyone is closed. So maybe the cannon you have to climb through a house to. Um. Climb through this, through a house, so that the squids be there. Closing their sense. Lots of burning builders craters and fire. There is a disintegration therein. Hmm. Hmm. So would Mario not be an enemy here? I don't know. It's kind of weird if Mario is both an enemy and also like the savior. Oh, but if we have the TV show the thing with Mario killing Shy Guys, I think it's fine. That it's actually going to be so funny, though.  So then we just need one more star. So everything is closed. TV is playing a commercial warning of. There will be burning squids with danger triangles. Um. Somewhat linear path to the squid gallery boss.  Does it blend in with the atmosphere then? Nope. It's all a space station. Ready for breakfast? Cereal. I wish they had cereal with less chocolate in them, but they just don't. So now I basically eat candy for breakfast and I hate it. Welcome to North America. What else would they have? We have the crop plantation. We have the main brocket. And. What other essentials do you have for living? A water plant. A water plantation or something like that could work. I don't want to steal from Doriel, but he had this really cool level. Let me see if I can find that. My channel is. Full of stuff. This one. Floating water bubbles like this as like. The place where they store their water would work. Does Mario Galaxy have that? Oh, they have water tanks like this. Zelda's flying water bubbles? True. Do you have a link to that? Hmm. Which temple is it? Like Sky Temple? The temple? Right, and even at low gravity and everything. Yeah, I think that's fine to use then. Of course. And each. And him. The overworld in this game will be the entirety of Yoshi's Island. So you will be able to explore every single square inch of Yoshi's Island in the overworld. That's the idea. And I think that will be super fun. It'll be like the further you get into the game. The more you will be able to explore the island. I have a link. Let's see what this is. Oh, this looks really nice. I like this texture for the water a lot. The island will be full of secrets. Right now there's 6 secret levels. Kind of like in Home Madness 64. I'm thinking of maybe turning that into 9. So we can make way more secrets. And I'm also planning more secret overworld stars. So hopefully it's gonna feel a lot more elaborate than R64's overworld. I think the overworld is really the most important part of the game. The overworld is the reason Star Road is the best R64 hack to play. And that's like the most important thing to look out for. Alright, let's do that too. Water, storage, sky and marbles. So these are all fun and very linear, that works well. Oh look, it's made out of teatime. It will be, you know how Mario Party has like the fruit island thing? Yoshi's fruit island? That's what we'll do. Luigi may be in this game, but I'm not 100% certain. I say maybe like 8% chance. Yeah, I say fuck all of this. This sucks. How do you get to the water storage? What if you literally just walk? Also yes, the retro area on this level, we have a retro area on every level. That's like made after a pixel art game, but we ran out of pixel art games that are like decent. So the retro area on this level is going to be Mario 64 themed. I'm gonna have the whole area look like Mario 64 and it's gonna be like, oh my god, it looked that different. That sucks. Second favorite Mario 64, Mario game, Mario 64, kidding, kidding, I'm kidding. Don't kill me. Mario Kart Wii. I don't think he is reworking anything right now. I think he's taking a small break. I need to plan the area transitions a little bit. So I'm going to defeat the TVs actually work really, really well here with the Shy Guy newscast. Oh my God, that's going to be so cool. The bloom on the games is actually so crazy. I played Twilight Princess 100% for the first time, like maybe one or two months ago. And holy shit, the bloom is everywhere. Everything is just glowing. Whenever I see a picture with like really bad exposure nowadays, I say, wow, they put them on the Wii. Mario Tracker Mario Kart Wii. Maybe that Donkey Kong Snow Level. Did they remove the bloom on Wind Waker HD or did they add it? Base taxis could use that for transition. Oh yeah, we did want planes to be here. So if we didn't want all technology to be here. So if there was like, if we had space taxis that looked like how people imagined space taxis to look like in the 1950s, like flying cars, 1950s, what did people imagine flying cars to look like? What did people imagine flying cars to look like back then? What if we have this? A coconut ball is also great. Looks like a gorilla. So we definitely want that. It is Tyler. We can animate all we want. One really cool thing, actually, I can show this. I never showed this off in a short or anywhere, but this is a really cool thing. You see the sun there, how it moves? It's a Biomax idea, but it's so good. There's a car with wheels for the shop, though. It does look like it. Oh, DK Summoner is the name I see. Let's see. Take this taxi. Banger. How is that done? I just rotate the map depending on the camera pitch and so on. Yeah. I think the one thing that would really help this level is if I could make it bigger. Well, there is a lens flare, but there's also the effect of like the UVs rotate depending on what the camera pitches. Really, there's no correlation or no physical sense to it. It just rotates. Just because that's kind of how it looks like when you look at the sun. But yeah, we can animate whatever we want. How can we make this feel bigger? How big is this? I mean, it's only 30,000. Oh, I guess beyond 30,000 you kind of need insurance. But realistically, this is like the size we could have. I don't know, Tyler. Am I wrong on what it looks like to look directly in the sun? This one should work. Bubble and cap, cool. I don't know. What is this? What am I looking at? There's nothing here. Spinning rings like this in the background might be really cool and space station-like. Okay. I don't know. I'm not convinced on that. URL, spin the dot. The dot. Oh. So that's what people imagine flying taxis to be like in the 1960s. Interesting. Okay, let me think of a way to make this bigger. Because ideally what we would do is you would be able to go to more areas without a direct warp transition. Which kind of requires the whole level to be bigger. Which obviously is not that easy. What if you just make Mario half-size? Let me see how that would work. But making Mario half-size is like a cost that's added to every other level. I know how to make Mario half-size. I can easily do this. Do I want to? No. Okay. What if I added a get function system here? Just like a special function per level. Then I half Mario's movement every frame. It's gonna be all weird with collision. Nah. There's no good way to make that work. We would also lose a lot of Z position, which is not good. We can use instant warps, which is a Mario 64 thing. Where basically as soon as you touch a certain surface, you teleport so and so many coordinates. We'd have to make the background fully a little bit far away instead of just semi-infinite. I know what I'm saying, don't worry. The problem with that I have is that we need to maintain like... In such an open area, we need to add fog everywhere. So that things in the distance kind of fog out. And that would look terrible with the background. Unless we did like an alpha fog kind of thing. But that's gonna be impossible otherwise. Man. Every idea I have for this is so stupid. It's... Going poorly. But this is just a thing to turn like a good level idea even better. I think this level idea is fine even if we can't get everything to look like it's super big. Hmm. The alternative is to just add black holes everywhere that teleport you between different areas here. Or to have this be a relatively small area. Or we can have this be a very vertical area. What if we make this very vertical? There's stuff everywhere. And then... What do we need? We need the rocket entrance. We need the squid place. We need the water storage entrance. And the crop entrance. Flipper piece is down below. Squid could go up here somewhere. The plantation entrance could be somewhere else where it makes sense. But maybe it's unreachable because no flying taxis. Floating at that point.   Yes.  Umm. Enter by black hole. And we can reach the black hole or get close to it by default. Because the taxi to the black hole is missing. Good. Flipper pieces is fine if you can do it from the start. Shy guy rocket.  Clustering next one. Running for a crop plantation to the end. We can also not get there because... Oh, we don't actually need this. Let's taxi. Let's taxi. Okay, okay, okay. So. The idea here. The way this will work. There will be houses all around. You can go on the base layer everywhere. There will be a taxi that drives to the entrance path to the crop plantation. There will be a taxi that drives to the entrance path to the water plantation. There will be a path open from the get-go that you can go down. Where if you go down there. You reach the squid at the end. I think the squid should be visible from the get-go. But not easily reachable. So. It should be visible when you spawn in the area.  To reach it you basically need to go to the other side. To the sky. To the top of the rocket. Then. Over a wire alley. It's like something. You got it. So when you're going here. You go in here. Then it's all up, up, up, up, up, up here. Then something from here shoots you down here. That works. Then we have something maybe from here to like. Here. And from there on you go maybe here or something. And then to the plantation. Which is good. Because now. While you go here. You see this whole thing and you're like. What the hell is that? I want to go there. But maybe when we go up here. Maybe from here to like here or something. Is the entrance to the water farm. And while you go up here. And up here. You see the other star. So good. Perfect. Now we have to play. Perceive. All three of the normal stars. But not able to enter them. Until they've beaten the squids. Which is good. Because now when you do that. You have like a lot of other things. Where it's like. Shit. I want to go there. So you're never in this level. Feeling clueless on what to do. But it still feels very open. So that's exactly what we want. I think this will work very well. And I think I'm now much more happy. With how this level is going. We don't want these pixel arts. That's cringe. The Yoshi coins will of course. Also change completely. And maybe we'll just call this. Sky guys. Yeah. I think we've made very good and valuable progress today. Even though we didn't physically change many things. We made some very very important notes. For the design of the stage. We made the important realization. That the idea we had for this level is terrible. And we're going to do something better. And I think I'm done for today. Okay. Wait. I missed like 15 minutes of chat. Oh my god. I was scrolled up. I'm so sorry guys. Let me read this first. Shit. But you could make spinning times. It's kind of orbit something. True. Thing. But the game praying take place in the space station. I had demos of the 20s. And the retro features of the 1960s. Let's see. Play video game. Definitely not really into shooter. I don't really see much unfortunately. Slingshot from our galaxy. I have thought about that. I'm not doing that. For Mario which is a robot. You have to battle him for Mario to prove himself worthy. Not fitting for this. Mario does the rocket. Then goes to the other section of the level. Yeah. Kind of the idea we had with the cannon. Interior trimming. Why not a big pre-rendered billboard of the next area and fade out as you fly into it. That would look terrible. World size. Build a lot of caves and underground locations. We can't have underground. It's open space unfortunately. See my comment on the neon bridges. How am I winning the game? Yes. I've seen that. I might implement that. Wormholes. Doable. I've seen it on ROM hack before. Another concept. Easy. Just Mario. No, no, no, no. The story. I think the story wouldn't really come across. It would just seem like there's a weird Mario OC happening. I think the space is a much better boss for this. I have not awesome thoughts on Celeste. I find my analog controls otherwise I can't play video games. So no, don't like it. But OK. I was going to end stream. We're done for today. I will see you guys in the next stream, which I don't know when it's going to happen. I still have next week off. So I might do a bonus stream or two. Bye.
