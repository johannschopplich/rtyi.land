You You Hello Sully hello X links Hello, hello, welcome to the stream. I Spent this week scripting and editing my longest video yet And it's not even that interesting of a topic but hopefully the algorithm will bless this video I feel like it will You Last thing we're here Go back home Who me better? You're telling me to go back to my own country Bro You Your stone that doesn't make any better I don't play man You Bizarre okay, I know like oh, okay. Oh, okay You Hey, so I sent bucks for the demo I'm not sure. What buck did you find? Is it a known buck is it an unknown buck What yo, what up what just happened Yo, thank you for the 48 months Zayna my wife You making Canada smell like Germans, that's rude When you're telling kids to go back to Germany dude, I don't want to be in Germany Germany is hell You You I can take the Canadian citizenship test in like five months Good iron ice there. What is iron ice? Never heard of this, but I do get a lot of screen time You Come on I can I show speed stream to this is very relaxing transition It's true I am home, what's the OST of today? I don't know yet Yeah This is too awkward of a platforming thing to like do it like I wouldn't want the player to do that And then this too This is weird I Wasn't there in canoe Kistana What is it canoe Kistana what the fuck that I just hit huh There's nothing there what What Either way, what OST do we listen to today any wishes? You Really ages does not work on an N64 hardware looking country. Oh, okay. Let's do it And another Mario 64 moment that's like a fucked-up thing that I must have added to the game somehow I Know it's Canadian. Oh, I thought that was like an insult What does cannot mean that Canadian, huh That doesn't sound right to me I Think of volcano, what's that? By the people I mentioned saying the most random things Huh I Know Sarah if I didn't say it yet I Just kind of has a charm to it Happy birthday. Thank you And it's not my birthday, but I would like to receive birthday gifts, so I will not even pretend like it's not my birthday Dude you would not believe the video I'm making What do you think of my voice in this video listen to it? I added to this with like BL studio FL studio. Oh I can't hear it 3d games like the butterflies There's no advantage just because this check is free, but there's a slight disadvantage to that in attend with it on Mario 64 They sound so uninterested Thank You Aguila I Mean you're kicking and squishy mushrooms in a demo myself the mechanic how so what happens when you do that? I'm guessing you mean these here I Guess you can roll out on them. That's weird You know missing character designs that's graphic design artists right now I Don't really have the money to commission random people, but I would absolutely like to get work done for this came out In the same frame How I did a dive there, yeah, I can see it I Guess it doesn't count as blended. Yeah, Zayn. I'm so long bio backups with that I already have a lot of with it, but I could always use more people Yeah, there's a chance I will do that bare metal baron I was thinking maybe using the static recompilation to release this game both like as an n64 game with Mario and Officially as like a game on Steam I think that could work pretty well So we kind of want this to be a path that goes here actually let's import the flying ship first Or the flying car rather I Making working on that video makes me feel so sick It's so much work and so exhausting. I keep making videos. I Mean of course your friend can write me on Twitter If I'm not interested, I just ignore it. I don't really know what your pitch is here because if it's like Pay me money and I'll make characters for you, then it's probably a no If it's like oh I want to help you make the game so I'm offering my work for free then it's probably yes Hey It kicks out a limited cut I'm scared of using Kickstarter and because of sales tax loss. I don't understand how they work with Kickstarter and I'm kind of scared of getting completely fucked See You One problem I see with your friend helping is that he probably doesn't understand how n64 shaders work So that's gonna be super difficult for him to even do anything on the game I'm a little worried. I'm gonna have to spend so much time teaching him that he ends up costing more time than he saves, you know It actually happens fairly frequently with artists that offer help unfortunately They they are like approaching me in good faith and they want to help out But then it turns out they don't actually know what needs to be done for an n64 game Then they end up needing a bunch of introduction and end up not actually producing anything for the game I'm designing a rocket. You could make it look like a lava lamp. True death. It will look really cool That's funny Samuel Did you say on Steam Mario, no, it would not be Mario Obviously, I would replace all Nintendo assets and would kick out the last bit of Nintendo code as well I'm not just going to release a Mario game on Steam. That would literally be insanity You guys think I am stupid sometimes I know it doesn't look great, but it's good enough for the first revision, I guess Which character sense if you're interested in converting her to see on a piece of like promotional artwork piece on characters and such Not like wait so just like designing characters That's definitely not something I'll be able to pay for Most of the time the people that 3d model are also the ones designing it Usually it's in the opposite there's like so many people that come up to you with designs that they want to see mate and They ask you if you can make them for them, right? I'm not gonna pay someone so I can make their ideas for them Okay, mr. Smarty, yeah, I'm such a smarty pants because I'm not going to release Nintendo's IP What is smart ass He thinks he knows that it's illegal to release Mario games But he doesn't actually he needs me to tell him But he's been such a smart ass about it Typical streamer behavior You Well, like I said, I would remove all the Mario engine parts There isn't really much left of Mario's engine there's a little bit of sound code and Obviously Mario as a character would be completely replaced. So Mario's character wouldn't be in there anymore or any of Mars movement code So really there's nothing of Mario 64 left in it anymore I Know Zena, I don't want to show anything But yeah, I'm actually in the opposite situation where a bunch of people approach me all the time asking me to make their designs real Super Kevin, who's that? Oh, that's right switch to trailers dropped You saw the character it looks great. I don't think I showed it off anywhere I Don't know how that's possible Did your friend ever like, get commissions like that? Cause like, that seems insane to me. That, that's like a business. Making this a low poly model sucks. New Mario Kart looks sick? Uh, my brother-in-law said that the new Mario Kart looks like it's designed after the SNES Mario Kart. What are we thinking of that? Is that true? Remember creating animal characters and the like, due to them being in Pokémon Denier Run, so they get... Here's the... Design or make artwork. Ah. Usually what I see is people already have a design in mind and then they want someone to create like an artwork for it. But I've never seen the opposite, where someone makes a design and then they want others to create the 3D model for it. Do you mean to drive these cars in the lava or would it be like platforms you have to jump on? They will just be platforms to jump on. I don't like to take the base Mario 64 movement away from the player too much. I actually have not played any Fallout game. I have watched a TV show though. Do Fallout fans like the Fallout TV show? I thought it was kinda good. Hmm. The Donkey Kong movie model is really nice, but not in the game. I think it's gonna be Mario Kart 9. I think it's gonna be Mario Kart 10. You don't like the new Donkey Kong model? I don't have strong feelings about it right now. I'll have to see what his personality is like in-game to judge it. This condition is still a clusterfuck. This has to be even simpler. Hmm. Hello, Vibrance. Do you plan on making an N64 game in the future? The only reason I made one last year was because I was paid to do it. So unless I'm paid to do it again, I will not. And I doubt that I will be paid to do it again, because I already did it once. Hehe. Still 82 triangles. Where's ChatGPT? I don't see ChatGPT in chat, and I don't see lots of text. Who's posting lots of text? What is going on? Is this just not showing on my end for some reason? What is going on? Fill me in, guys. Why are you leaving me out of this conversation? I feel so left out. I only have to do this on this side. He's trolled. I'm being trolled by someone pretending that there's someone in chat I can't see. That is a very elaborate troll. Donkey Kong... Donkey slap bitches. Alright, thank you, Donkey Kong. I'm just not... So, heh? Heh? You guys are confusing me. Chat is yapping. Absolute nonsense going on in chat. Yohan, thank you for 20 gifted subs? Oh my god, that is crazy. Chat is yapping. Chat is yapping. Those... That's a weird question. Because, like, the N64-specific optimizations are not going to be optimizations on the PC. So, like, the issue would be if the optimizations made it difficult to compile the code for PC, which has nothing to do with power. Do you know what I mean? But the answer is, I don't think so. Someone just gifted 20 YouTube subs, or memberships. Yohan, thank you very much. Thoughts on Windows 11? Nope, no thoughts at all. I hope I don't have to use it. Here's a few more big optimizations, yeah? Well, none are really super duper big. Yeah, we got it down to 76 triangles, which is still, like, way too much, honestly. That's so goddamn inaccurate, I don't want to do it. Really, the only reason I ever update Windows is security updates, and the only thing I dislike about Windows 11 is that it's going to make Windows 10 security updates stop. Probably get away with that. That would save a couple triangles. And that actually would probably play better, too. Let's do that. Yeah, 72, we're getting there. I actually do not like you, but I like your work. That's interesting, why do you not like me? There's many reasons not to like me, don't get me wrong. But, like, what is your reason specifically? Hmm. I mean, if I could do this, that would save, like, two triangles. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah. Yeah, well, Ivan, Sean and I have nothing. Oh, so it's, like, jealousy? That's... it's cliche to say, but I think that's a pretty common reason not to like me. Okay, 64 triangles should be good. How is being a father? Eh, it's fine. No strong feelings about it. I have strong feelings about very few things, like Mario Sunshine, I have strong feelings about that one. Yeah. I'm a normal person. Yeah, I don't like procrastinating. Okay, the thing is, sometimes I would like to procrastinate, because I'm, like, exhausted from work. But then it's like, there's nothing to procrastinate with, and it's like, what do I even do? Fuck. Fuck, I exported this as Ice Block from Tiny Huge Islands? Oh, fuck. I didn't want that. That's fine, we can undo that. It's just gonna take a little bit. Where's TikTok Clock? Am I blind? What do you think about the Switch 2? It looks like a bigger Switch one. I think the Gamecube for Wii was strong enough to do everything, so for me, any new console is literally just... Pay us money again, so you're allowed to play the new games. So for me, I'm not very excited about the Switch 2. I'm actually glad it took so long before the Switch 2 came out. For me, it's just like, well, I guess there's another $500. This is true Rare Metal Marin, that is how I feel. I actually think Mario Kart peaked with Mario Kart Wii, and since then it's just been downhill. My first party Switch lineup is a sting of laziness. It's safe and productive, but I don't think it's lazy. The Switch games seem very elaborate to me. There's my Mario Kart 2-er, and I'm pretty sure Nintendo considers that a mainline Mario Kart. As soon as I'm back towards the Wii, but I'm interested in seeing what Nintendo does with their consoles, I wonder how the Joy-Con Mouse thing will be used. What is the Joy-Con Mouse thing? I don't know. Breath of the Wild, honestly, was great. Tears of the Kingdom, eh. But Breath of the Wild, I liked that one a lot. It has all that freedom stuff that I value a lot, and it's good that you do something and gain a new insight, it feels like. Imagine if they finished Twilight Princess and released that as a game. Oh my god, that would be so good. I haven't played Echoes of Wisdom yet. See, I'm in no rush at all to play games. I still have a bunch of games to play. Playing games on MS these days, I think it was great on 8 megabytes, now games on 100 gigabytes. Uhhh... Because it's cheaper to develop that way. They're not optimizing the games, like graphics or whatever, they're optimizing the cost to develop games. They're min-mixing money. What game do you still play? What game do you still play and is Conker's Bread for Day any good? The only game I still play is Bobble Battle. It's the best game ever. And Conker's Bread for Day is... You better watch it rather than play it. What's Bobble Battle? It's Bobble Battle, bro. What a question is that? Bobble Battle is a battle of creativity. Only people with a soul will enjoy Bobble Battle, but if you have a soul, then the game is really fun. Do you like any of the PRs? Yeah, I liked all of them except Color, Splash, and I never played Sticker Star. Compiling from clean takes like 25 seconds for me. You liked Origami King? Origami King was not as good as the others, but Origami King kind of felt like an experiment Nintendo did where they tried to make a game as fun as possible with zero extrinsic motivation. The entire game is just like you do things for the fun of it. But the battle in that game really sucks. I hate the battling in it. Everything else is fun. I did play the OG Mario RPG a little bit and then I got to the idea and I stopped. You know what, I only need two Action Stands. OG Mario RPG is fun, but I definitely wouldn't call it the best Mario RPG. Yeah. I have it all on Git, what the f- I'm scared that my hard drive is going to break or someone's going to break into my house and destroy my PC or something like that. Whenever I leave my house I backup everything. That's what I use Git for. A schizo arc, I think that's just being reasonable. 0.1 on N64, make Mario 64 faster. No, it makes it slower. But it is used, so unlucky. I need to un-use it. I did not play Stupid Death by AI. What's that? Hello, Sam memory. Can Instagram open a messaging on your PC and say there's something behind you? No. It will not do that. No, I'm not hacking your PC for no reason. Performance, I've downloaded it called Readability. I'm sure there are some places where you could sacrifice readability for performance, but I just haven't seen those places. So they are programmed not to do anything during Act 1, so this is actually fine. They are supposed to do that. Let's debug this setup here. I forgot to make it move.  All right. Couldn't make a difference. See the next video, let's count every shader in Mario 64 explained. That's what I'm thinking. But maybe I can come up with a better name. Hey, I should have used the move angle job. My bad. Why is it not solid though? That one's a bit weird. Yes, it is Shy Cactus. Oh no, it's Sine Wave. I think many emulators have viruses. It just takes someone to find them. There was one in Parallel Launcher too, that was found like a week after. So it's, you know, actually most emulators have one. It's just that the other emulators get patched to fix it. And then the patch to fix the vulnerability in Parallel Launcher made it so my hack doesn't work on it anymore. Awesome. Because it was poorly programmed. Oh, I simply forgot to load up the collision monocle, but that will do it. Alright, we got Space Taxi. Just increase the time it spends flying back and forth. And then we should be able to make that gap easier. Okay, I messed up, that was the wrong B part. So go back to 20, and I think I need to change B part 3. 72 seems good to me. Every shader in Mario 64 is at about... Basically, you know what a shader is? A thing that draws a triangle properly. It's like explaining every effect of Mario 64. Maybe there's a better name for it that's more commonly understandable. I think shader kind of works, because it's a word many people have heard and they won't know what it is. So they want to click on it just to know. And I just make it go back and forth without turning. I don't know, Samuel. Hello, Boofluck. We're working on Space Taxi. Well, actually, Space Taxi just got done. We are working on this section of the level here, the beige one. It needs to go into the black hole here. Over there. So we need to make platforms to reach that part. Why don't we have to... Why don't we have to go down through space? Rather. Speak English to me. Sorry, don't worry about it. Is this a Gen Z thing where you just don't speak proper English? You want to have to wait less? I don't think you have to wait here at all, actually. Or, well, maybe you have to wait a little bit. But I don't think it's an issue if you have to wait a little bit. And you can do that, too. How cool is that? But this jump here sucks. Why don't we ever go down through space? I don't understand that either. What do you mean by go down? They want Mario to, like, jump down here onto Earth? Is that what you're saying? I'm so sad that space taxi is not popular here in America. Yeah. Those movies that are only popular in Germany where the whole joke is, like, the main characters are gay. It's fucking wild that that's a real thing. Yeah. Do we maybe add, like, a flagpole you climb or something to get up here? Like an antenna. Oh, an antenna you climb would look so good. I'm going to do that. And it's not fitting, too. I'm not sure I'm doing it right. There's a lot of info about that Fast64 Discord server. Personally, I don't know that much about it either. But whenever Sauron gives me, like, an estimate and cycles about how many microseconds we save, it's usually pretty accurate. No, it's from the Mario 64 devs. Well, that's what the video is about. Oh, I'm looking at the antenna. Satellite. What do they look like? I'm sure there's some cool ones. And a Star Wars. And there's, like, a specific one I'm thinking of. I just placed on one car. Obviously, that's not it. It's just one object we need now. There's going to be more cars here. I can't make the whole level, like, at the same time. I have to do one thing at a time. I can't just teleport it all in. Stream says it's a YouTube feature. What does it mean? Maybe because someone gifted 20 YouTube memberships, YouTube's like, oh, this is a good stream. We need to send more people there. We already have satellites. Yeah, so Dodongo is doing his thing on Lib Dragon, though. So, unfortunately, I can't really use his work. Unless his work is also used in X3 for, like, some optimization. That's fine, I guess. How do you communicate to the player that a barrel roll is going to happen? Boy. Just Mario 64, because that's the first game I saw possible to mod. If I had seen Sonic Adventure 1 or 2 before that, then I probably would have become a modder for that game. And I would be rich in face now, because Sega doesn't squeeze my balls like that. Wouldn't that be nice? I'm thinking of a specific kind of antenna, but it's hard to visualize it. Let me just draw it down. Maybe that works. Maybe I just fucking draw it, and then that's exactly what I'm talking about. I'm ultimately going to be able to roam here soon. Uh-huh. I know very little about Lib Dragon, unfortunately, so I can't commentate on how good that is or how bad it is. The thing is, the people that work on Lib Dragon, they seem so knowledgeable and so skilled at what they do. But then the games that actually use Lib Dragon that I've seen often run extremely poorly. And some of the guidelines they have for it seem not great for me. They care about CPU cycles, for one thing. I think that's a completely wrong approach to the N64. That would be really cool, GreenStache, but Twitch themselves makes it so that that's not allowed. So Twitch wants to keep their monopoly on the streaming industry. It enables slop? What does that mean? Like, it's so easy to use it that even people that produce garbage can use it? Is that what I'm hearing here? Doesn't seem like a big issue to me. It seems to be a good thing, actually. I don't know. Low effort games seem like an inevitability to me. But I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. There's many people who are like good at graphics or have like a great game idea but they can't program at all. Wasn't it Toby Fox famously who said that they can't really program? Maybe I'm wrong here. Audition got a lot of attention since the update. I don't believe you. What about proof? You are my Andrew Tate. That's funny. You are my little Sigma. You already see this on other parts of the screen search. I don't think we need to explain everything. So my intent idea was something like this and then there would be a mesh kit in front of it and why is it screwed like that? Oh, I see. Yeah, I have used geometry nodes before. Most of the time though when we use geometry nodes, we have to remove them again afterwards because they end up being like a quick and dirty thing that doesn't look as pretty. Booty got a arrow. That looks fun. So I was talking to Biobank about the Yoshi boss idea that we had and maybe wanted to make into the game and I agree with what he said about it being maybe a little cryptic and he brought up a few other ideas that maybe we're going to do. His idea was, wait one second. Let me just see the Biobank message here. Biobank was thinking something like this. He gets sent kind of far away. Yeah, we were thinking maybe he like attacks out of black holes with his face and his tentacles mostly and then he has attack patterns where he attacks with these antenna and the tentacles and since he has the tumors that you have to heal, you maybe have to like jump into his mouth and like destroy the tumors inside and I think that works. I am using C but C and C++ are basically the same thing. So it doesn't really make a difference. I would never watch a sport. Including American football. I don't know. I don't understand. Yeah, Octoyoshi is a good name for it. Okay, I was thinking something kind of like that but less poopy looking. Okay, now how would you ever think to climb this? This sucks. I don't like it. Maybe antenna to climb was the wrong thing here. Yeah, I no longer like the antenna idea. We need something else. Actually, maybe the antenna is fine. She's great on a ball. Yeah, that's that's what it looked like. Would it be bad to have multiples of these around the area? Would it look cool? I don't know what they are yet, but I'm sure we can make it. Pick up some bolts and threads. I feel like the last one should be something else in progression. No, I don't think so. I mean there is progression here, but I don't think that needs to be for the last level. And the progression is also very soft. As in there's not a lot of it. It's kind of in the background of the level. I'm with sports. I just don't see the point of watching sports. I'm very indifferent to which team wins. Unless I did like sports betting or something. Then I guess sports would be fun to watch. But like if I don't care about the outcome, it's very uninteresting to watch. Someone would rather play sports than watch sports. Five gram drum looking things maybe. Oh, that's a fun looking thing. But no, we want retrofuturism, not 5G. Well, they're good for social skills even to just talk about it. I don't enjoy just talking to people for no reason. So I especially wouldn't learn about the topic just so I can talk to people for no reason. I'm actually on a farm and I'm just waiting to see the outcome of who wins. Like what? In a book where you write everything you want in the mod? Not a book, but a notepad file. Oh. Can you actually not be able to hear? Dang. I thought you would be able to. Oh. Okay, we need this path to continue somehow. Take a form of dance. Well, I don't like watching dance either. But I can see the appeal. You want to watch it to be impressed by the skill. Hmm. So now we have the concert hall. What else do we add to the level? More flying cars? Maybe. I need something that keeps going from here. And the idea of climbing the microphone is just kind of fun. So maybe we can achieve that somehow. Is he a basketball fan? This is kind of just a nice place to be. This is like fun to stand on. Flying parking lot? Oh, that's a cool idea. Of course. There's whenever a parking lot attached to it. How would a flying parking lot look like? A bunch of individual parking spaces? That could look cool. Hmm. How can I make it so the player can keep climbing from here though? Hmm. I don't want the player to do that. That sucks. Yes, Bruno! That's still the plan. It's just not a priority to 3D model those right now. I don't know. I could make the back of the gramophone like thick so that you can actually move on it. But it also wouldn't look good. What if there were like stairs built into the side of the gramophone? We could make that look sick actually. Wait, I kind of love that idea. That's just the type of schizophrenic thinking you need to be in a game.  Screen tear is not an issue because the game has V-Sync always on. And trust me, you do not want to turn V-Sync off. I know there's V-Sync haters in here, but just trust me on this one. I don't know. Musical notes on a pentagram twisting? I don't know what that means, unfortunately. Dino, we have a grocery store. Maybe we allowed a dino? The problem we have in this area is that this area is already very complex. And it's going to lag if we keep adding too much stuff to it. So the things we have to add to it now have to be simple. One, two, three, four. That's far enough. Why didn't I just do the math? Don't I just do pit? 700 divided by 4. 175. There we go. The answer is yes, I can. Because I can do whatever I want. Because I'm making the game. Like this. I don't see this being a building. A giant spinning record like below here? Let's see. Like this? And then we have the vertex colors be dynamic or we have this be like a decal? That is possible, yeah. That could look pretty good. The problem is we can't make it very round. Hmm. I like the spinning record idea. Piano key staircase? Yeah, we can have this piano keys colored. I do like that idea. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1. Okay. Let's do it. Slightly inaccurate, but honestly it's fine. I guess. Let's see if you don't. That's kind of a cool looking staircase. And now we just have to speed the auto-combat and I think we're good. What the hell, it's MP-64. Oh, Mupen64Plus. Someone left a comment in my last video that it runs on Android and Mupen64Plus. Maybe you should look into that. Maybe you won't eat the shirt. I don't understand. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  I don't know. I don't know. I think that looks good. The piano stairs. There's good poles and hangable ceilings, I have notched. They both still exist. They're not as reflective looking as I'd like them to be. The light coming from inside the piano house looks great though. Yeah, why are these not... oh wait, I know why. I do not know why. Heh. What information. Hmm. This is bizarre. I use hangable ceilings very rarely. Because I agree that they're not that fun most of the time. I'm obviously not sticking with the random pipes. The hub world is going to be all of Yoshi's Island. So you will be able to explore the full island. The reason I leave the hub world for last is that I think the hub world is by far the most important part of the game. And you need to make sure it's perfect. And to do so it is best if you already have all the other levels done. So you can plan like decent level entrances and stuff like that. I already recalculated normals. Alright, and after this is space parking lots. I do like this. This looks very cool. Man, I had to play standard Mario 64 to record like clips and like... Man, the movement is rough in that. What the fuck? Okay, we have too many collision triangles if that's happening. The hub world will be so full of secrets. I was thinking of maybe adding more secret levels than the original game had. Just because I want the hub to be so full of secrets. That is possible as perfect. That's likely what I will do in the end. Yeah, the hub world is the most important part because it ties everything together. The hub world is I think the only reason Mario 64 was famous, popular. If Mario 64 hadn't had a hub world, I don't think anyone would have liked the game. College is not free in Germany, but it's like maybe like $300 for every 6 months. And you get a bunch of benefits that basically mean that college is negative amount of cost. So yeah, actually it's more accurate to say you get paid to go to college in Germany. That could be done, Rookie. I'm not 100% opposed to something like that. 100 and... 300. So my parking space would have to be like... This size. Because I never went to a set true. Wrong button. Yeah, Germany is a very socialist country. You kind of get everything gifted if you're poor. And if you make any money, they basically take everything from you. Doesn't really make sense to work in Germany. Actually, I calculated this recently. If I lived in Germany and I was only ROM hacking, I would make more money if I just did ROM hack. Like, it would be cheaper for me to live in Germany if I didn't work than if I did work. I have no admittance. I mean, the first level would definitely run fine. But the later levels are made with the new engine optimizations in mind. So those would obviously not run fine. I have tried 240i, though. Don't recommend it. 240i looks really bad. This could look really cool. The hub will be Yoshi's Island, and it's going to be all flute-themed to fit the Yoshi aesthetic. I mean, German culture is all about helping each other. This is true. And I guess that is kind of nice. But at the same time, people are not really helping each other that much, as much as the culture incentivizes. There's so many people taking advantage of the system. As in, politicians are making the system worse. Also politicians to get more votes. So it just doesn't really work out, I think. I don't actually know. I know very little about German politics, to be honest. But that's how I perceived it to be. I just know taxes in Germany are much higher than here in Canada. And people are already saying they're high in Canada. Well, actually people are saying taxes are high literally everywhere. That doesn't really mean anything. I guess they're always high relative to what you get out of your taxes, because corruption. Döner kebab? Yes, döner is awesome. I wish they had döner here in Canada. It would be so awesome. Instead they only have doner, which is like döner, but it's missing all the salad. And it's so sharp that you can't really eat it. Or well, you can eat it, but it's like unpleasant to eat. There is no döner here, Zelda. That's the problem. The marketing for the GBA port is pretty cool. I am making a video with the GBA port guy. He already recorded all of the voice lines and a bunch of footage for me. I just need to put the video together. Oh, those cars were supposed to not move. That didn't work. I see why. I probably did wrong. They're also too small. I know this is a very inefficient space taxi parking lot. But what can you do, man? Those shy guys. The hell is tomato döner? Isn't there always tomato in döner? Is tomato döner like a döner with way too much tomato? Sounds not great. I also don't know what döner is, but I've heard the word before. Ha! They're still driving around in their taxis? Do they want us to rap? Oh. Okay, now for real. Okay, now for real. This time for real. I've never done anything with Dreamcast now. I never even touched a Dreamcast or saw a Dreamcast in my life. I have no idea what the console even looks like. There we go. Parked cars. The collision is also easily accurate enough. That's good. I think a rocket like the one when worlds collide would look good. I have never seen that movie, so I wouldn't know. This is a pretty cool looking platform piece. And this is going to be fun to platform onto. I almost want to put more. Some height variation. This is cool. This is fun. I like it. What are you cooking today? Quest 15 progress. Hello, unknown. Let's see, what's called light rockets. Very sleek looking, but it's so low detail that I don't think it's going to look good in the size that we need here. I played Sonic Adventure on the Gamecube. Aren't Americans spanned off of TikTok? I thought TikTok is spanned now. We need to make enhancements? For sure, dude. I think that is going to be the future. I think eventually we will all have computer enhanced bodies and we will eventually no longer be human. And then most humans will die out and we're just like 15 cyborgs living on the planet, fighting for who gets to control it. It will be awesome. People are going to go on Instagram reels instead of TikTok. I can already tell it. Or like Facebook reels. Or like Twitter reels instead of thing. Or YouTube shorts. I definitely would take brain enhancements. I'm not going to be behind. I'm not going to like the fact that we're all on brain enhancements, but I also don't want to be left behind, you know? Maybe they should have some random rotations here. Make them look even more disorganized. They're all shy guys, man. They can't talk for shit. Can you believe it? No, these are not working NPCs here. I wish I guess look, they're going to be shy guys. Zayna already drew something for them. The commute's probably simple, right? Because you can just fly wherever you want. It's like a small village. They probably don't even drive their cars most of the time. I don't know. I don't know. Do you plan to do a course 3 analysis? Yes. All the courses will have an analysis before Biobank's rework happens. Right now, Biobank is working on course 2. So, no analysis right now for that. Does the Mario and Kappa nose physics use the same technique? Like it could work on other body parts? It would work on every body part, but they do not use the same technique. Yes, the hub is going to change, I suppose. I want to make the most alive-feeling hub of all time. There's going to be so much shit in the hub. All right, I think we got this path done. I'm just going to move this back a little bit. I'm going to miss course 2? Exactly. That's why Biobank is working on course 2. After that, I'm going to work on course 3. I actually already did most of the course 3 analysis. But then I got sidetracked and didn't finish it. I also was in university for four years. And I, on purpose, just didn't go out to meet people. Because I wanted to spend all my time working. That is not good for your mental health. And I don't recommend anyone does that. But I had like the loneliest possible college experience. And I wanted it that way. Oh shit, who remembers this from that time I became friends with the Royal Scuttlebuck family? Okay. Any real ones in chat? This is still all here and it works. And it leads here. Simple was trying to make the jump for 10 minutes. I am so mad at that still. I swear, Simple placed my axe poorly on purpose. I saw him play the demo too. He was so distracted. He didn't understand anything. Isn't the black hole spin? I don't know, maybe I forgot to make it spin. Played the new demo. Yeah, he wanted to play Rihanna's hack. And then he just didn't. For like the 15th time in a row. Then he played my hack. What's the level? That's course 14 inside, it's not finished. I don't know. I think Simple is just trolling me. He loves that. He loves trolling me. That's like his favorite thing to do. Okay, with that, there's only one path through the level missing. But let me check the performance of this for a second. Okay. Cool. That really shouldn't crash. Oh, I did change this recently, that's probably why. Like this is different now. Hmm. Let me first make sure it also happens on NEMU so I can debug faster. Hello Momfe, what are you talking about? Okay, good, good, good. Nice Nelventrick. I hope one day I can update the demo, like the current version of Course 1. It's very different. Oh, spawn special objects doesn't exist anymore. That makes sense. I don't know if I have a favorite console. Most of my favorite games are on the GameCube though, that's true. How many erasers do you have? Like, four? This one is my N64, this one here. And then this one is NEMU, and this one is Parallel, and this one is Project 64, and then this one is Internet Explorer, aka Ares. They all have their own purposes. Do you want to make perhaps a bad song request? No. Hmm. Hello Dan Salvato. You watched the MVG video? I think the MVG video is a little too negative. I don't know what's going on with MVG recently. He made two weird videos about the N64. I'm gonna read what you say this course is, like 40%. You got any questions about that MVG video, Dan? Let me get my old routine here from GitHub to see if that is the issue. I don't think N64 emulation is that bad at all. Like, if you look at something like Ares, Ares is pretty good. It's pretty close to the real thing. Okay, what is that for? I mean, I wasn't bothered by it, but I imagine some of the emulator developers, especially like the Ares developers, who have been putting in a lot of work to be accurate to N64, probably Never heard of Ares as a totally new implementation? Ares is an emulator that aims to be cycle accurate. And the people that work on, what do you call it, LibDragon, which is an open source library where you develop N64 games on, they have their own microcode and everything like that, they're also working on Ares. So this was made by absolute pros. And it is very close to cycle accurate. In fact, I'll just show you what Ares does. This emulator is actually great for development. If I just load up my game here, which, let me just make sure I get my right game. Right here in the Ares window. Wait a little bit. See, and even like, let's me know through cache line emulation, where sometimes like a piece of cache was different from what it would usually be in commercial games. Like, oh, the RSP loaded this, even though this line is still dirty in the CPU. Maybe you want to fix that. This emulator is very accurate. I think there's a bug on real console where if you switch between DDEVA and no DDEVA constantly, you get like weird scan lines. And I guess that's not emulated. Okay, I did get a crash that I don't get on real hardware, but trust me, this is pretty accurate. I just do a lot of weird things. He said, now that we have the CPU for cycle accurate emulation, we're in good shape if we would have a PGSynchronous plugin system. Ah, yeah, I think this, I don't actually know this. I think this still uses the parallel RDP plugin, but I'm not 100% sure. True, the crash just now could have been from me messing with DDEVA too much. Dude, where is this? What the hell? 2500, read surface data, right here. To be fair, that might also just be me doing weird things that have a chance of crashing on real N64, but usually don't crash on hardware. Okay, I think I need to disable collision on a bunch of things here to see if that fixes it. Okay. Hello, Askel. Hello. I know very little about writing emulators. I could probably learn them, but I've never done it in any capacity. Yeah, okay, so we just have too many surface nodes, that makes sense. Fair enough that we get a crash there. Okay, that part looks good. How's it on RMG? I used it because ours is kind of demanding for my current hardware. It should work on RMG. I'm not sure exactly how it works. I just know that it doesn't really work on RMG for some reason and Rosalia is looking into it. But also there's like a way to make it work on RMG. Right, now I remember what I wanted to do. I wanted to check the performance on real hardware here. FPGAs as opposed to other emulators? Really? I'm surprised. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of FPGAs because FPGAs is like special hardware to like play it, right? So at that point, why wouldn't you just buy a normal N64? That just seems cheaper and like more accurate. I thought the point of emulation is kind of to make something more widely available than otherwise. I know that blowing on the cartridge doesn't do anything, but it is funny. It still crashes on real hardware, but not on Project 64. That is annoying, duuuuude. Fine, I will just temporarily add this. The people making the Mystar said they're gonna send like a free version to my house, which is pretty cool. I'm also getting the analog just to like see how well it emulates the RMG here. Oh my god, dude. I just wanna check the performance. What did you make of Mario Multiverse? I think it could be a really fun hack if they just spend like one or two more weeks polishing it up. Dude. This is my least favorite thing about the summer crowd. Sometimes I need to plug it out and plug it in to make it move. Okay, I give up. We're not console testing this today, unfortunately. Probably just need a much slower collision. Where in Canada are you from? I'm not from Canada. I run obscure test roms on the analog on the marketing. Easy. I don't wanna be too mean because I said one thing in the video and then one of the analog developers DMed me and was like, shit, you got me. We didn't emulate this. So like I already know it's not 100% accurate and like because they like right away admitted it's not 100% accurate, I don't wanna, you know, be too mean on them. I mean, no emulation makes sense because when you say emulation, people mean software. People think software emulation and it is not software emulation. So it makes sense. You wanna make sure everyone knows it's like not the same thing, but at the same time, it's a little cringe. Can we admit that? It is a little cringe to say no emulation. I am not in Quebec. I do not wanna be where the French are. I don't wanna be where the French are. Is it gonna be enough to let us get over there? It's actually the worst thing about living in Canada. Every product you buy has everything on it in English and then French. So you have to experience French all day. Truly tragic. It is otherwise the perfect country. Is this jump too difficult? You know what? It's course 15. Players can do that jump, right? Course 15, yeah, you can do that jump. Okay, but this jump is too difficult for course 15 even. I don't want the player to do that. Oh yeah, Dan, Dan, remember the dive where you said you don't like that you can change the direction during it? I have tried removing it so that you can't really change direction. And this was in the course 1 beta test thing. And people hated it. They completely hated it. So I made it so you can change the direction when you lose your speed now. And people seem to be more willing to accept that. They seem to like that a little bit. Actually like it. Yeah, yeah, now you like it. Now that it's doing like that, you change direction but you lose your speed. It definitely wants to appeal. Oh, what the hell? Oh no, I'm stuck. Yeah, exactly. People are like twice as mad if you take it away than if they had never had it. Well, more than twice. I get that. But people actually were willing to accept the change where you're allowed to change the direction but you lose your speed. One or two people reported that as a bug, but mostly people were willing to accept it. Yeah. Yeah, I think now is the time to update the CVs here to the new model. Yeah. The design here. Right, Bruno Gadsen sent me this. This looks very retro-futuristic and I like this. So we're going with this model here instead of what we have right now. The audio setting is definitely a bug in my code somewhere and I'm fairly confident I can find it. It's not something I want to focus on right now. That's kind of my death process. It's just like take the game, like ruin it, but make it more optimized and then fix the bugs. Risky optimizations and bug fixes. That's what I'm doing. I'm going to make a new blend file for this. I've never played Ratchet & Clank. I don't have anything against it. 16. I can use your magic from now on in a game or video I want to make. You are 16? Why is this relevant? What does you being 16 have to do with this? You are allowed to use my music, but you have to explain what you being 16 has to do with this. Otherwise, I will not allow you to use my music. I have absolutely erased the Chao. Back when I was a kid, I erased the Chao to all level 99s without knowing how the bug works. I did it legit. I beat City Escape like a million times. To farm animals. It's way too big. 16. He said that for the I'm just a kid vibe. So you're hoping I would let you do it because you're a small child and not because I would let anyone do it? I see, I see. 17. So you're also saying that you are a child who purposely takes advantage of the fact that other people know you are a child. I see, I see. Oh, I never erased the Chaos Chao. That was too much work for me. 18. I did beat all of Chao Racing like twice though. You make sure the aspect ratio is fine still. It absolutely is not. 19. Why does it feel so widescreen? 20. This feels too widescreen, but it's still 4 to 3, is it not? Am I stupid or something? 1.2. It doesn't feel right at all. Now it's 4 to 3, but... What is going on? 20. 21. I'm doing something insane here. Something's wrong with me. Okay, that makes a lot more sense. 22. I'm just gonna base this off lives. This is... This is about right now. It's not quite circular, but it's definitely very... Oops. This is the CRT we're going for, by the way. Dude, this looks... Yeah, this is even posted as retrofuturism. This is exactly what we want. It definitely looks like something you would buy because you want the futuristic-looking CRT and you live in the 50s. 21. It's gonna be difficult to make work in low-poly. I don't like that. 21. How many trymutes is an old CRT here? 0.99. That's only 54. So it's already 84. That's way more. Maybe because Outlander is a great game concept. Except for Chorus 4. You might just be someone who naturally enjoys that. The problem with Last Impact is that a lot of stuff I did, I was just like, let's put this in because it's a fun... It's a cool concept to think about and not because it's a fun game. That was usually my mindset making Last Impact. 22. I'm not that old. 23. Can we maybe snake these corners here too without it looking too weird? What? No, definitely not. Oh my god. What about these? Let me move them out and up a little bit. Nope. What about just this? And just this. And these two. That looks kind of nice. I kind of like that. And we do need to low-polygonize. 21. Holy shit, you are old. 22. I think we can't go far 100% accuracy here. I think something like this is what we need to go for. And then we can do the silver line here with the texture. This one cost 3000 dollars?! That's crazy. What? Why does that make everything sharp? It's not supposed to. That is weird, oh well. That's true, most of my demographic is probably around your age. I'm just looking into my youtube statistics, I have a lot of people in their 30s. So that would make sense. So, they have this cool box under the CRT in the screenshots, but I think I have to go without that. I'll keep this axis aligned for now so it's easy to place them. This, by the way, is going to play a GIF of a nose broadcast. How do we make a shiny looking gold and black thing here this year? That's going to be difficult. We can have a texture shift thing again and maybe that will work. But we also need to apply that to this. Yeah, I think that should work. Let me just use this image here for the colors. You want model and the neck part to bump, same as polygons? Yeah. I'm saving that one. Yeah, I think a lot of age statistics on youtube are going to be wrong because people love about their age. You can't use them as proof that you have an old audience or anything like that, but you can use them as an indicator, I guess. That's how I consider it. What's the difference between gold and orange? What's the difference between gold and orange? What's the difference between gold and orange? What's the difference between gold and orange? Saturation. Interesting theory. So we're doing something like this where we have one texture for the shine. Then we have one texture for the color. I don't understand why this is happening with the alpha though. That makes no sense right now. Huh. Oh, I can make a lot of this here. There we go. True, the N64 isn't even real. Why would you target that? Why didn't I think of that? So this looks like just a stripe, but I need it to be UV mapped correctly, like not just a stripe. So this is going to be a little annoying. And I also need it to be seamless with the other thing. Oh my God, that looks so bad. But if we get this right, then we'll have this and then the shine will on top of that move around. Oh, why do so many emulators targets? Why do so many creators target emulators rather than N64? The truth is, most people that make Mario 64X don't care about the N64 that much. They care about making games that people can play. So for them, there's little reason to actually target, like go through all the work to make it N64 compatible. Just want the game to be fun. And I think that's fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.   Why does it gotta be like that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Personally, I also play Romex on emulator, just because I find it more convenient and I'm much more used to the controller. Yeah. All right. And now comes the greatest trick. Fuck. That looks bad. Can you hear me? Do not get banned. That's the only rule. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Doing that. This should be a random bug. I think this is a vendor market. I don't think it actually does that. Or actually. Okay. All right, there we go. This is the concept. We have this, and then we can move the shadow around. Oh shit, that's the wrong thing. Then we can move the shadow around like so. Or the light rather. And it's going to look really good if everything goes well. I don't want to mirror this. I want to keep the UV map going naturally somehow. Is that even possible? I feel like I'm going to need a UV break somewhere. And hopefully that can be done at the bottom, so no one sees it. Oops. Okay. Okay, that is going to be a problem. Is this salvageable? Is that the only way of playing many of these hacks? Just an emissary study of me? Just You know what, I think it's fine to mirror it around here, so let's map this in here. I should maybe do the UV map first and then afterwards do the texture. Maybe that's the Alright, this is going to be a pain. What is that topology? This is perfectly fine topology. If you want to model in N64 games and all quads, have fun with your game barely even running on console because you're wasting so many triangles. Yo Flame, that's very nice. I have been reading all the feedback so far. Yeah, I need a different technique for this. I don't think this is a good way of reflecting this or making this not reflective. I might just have to say fuck it and make it not look reflective, although that feels not true to what the vision was in this image here. I don't know. I don't know. Here. That should mostly work. Yeah. Okay, I think this is doable now. Imagine we do this and then we have a texture that's basically just a square. And we UV map that around here to get this golden rim. And then on top of that, we make this reflect and shiny. And we don't even need a full square. We can just do a quarter of a square to save some texels. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Hi, I want to ask you something. I am trying to play the Rty Demo, but it won't play on my emulator. I'm using my phone to fix it. I have no idea. I didn't get it to run on a phone either. But someone left a comment somewhere about movement 64 plus working, but I don't know. Anyway, I'm done with stream for today. And I will see you guys another day. Until then. Bye bye.
