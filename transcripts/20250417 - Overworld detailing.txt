Hello. Hello, RK Ray. Hello, Bandy. Hello, James. How are you?    I'm fine. Why is there code stuff? I was doing code stuff just before the stream. Hello Sam Emery. Question, how would you recommend me to get into Mars64 modding? I think of a mod idea, something that takes you maybe two weeks to finish. Maybe just one course or something. And then download Blender and make it. OST? Yes, we need an OST. Part 13 I think is this. Send you north, mountains in the south. Yeah, that fits. I want to take a look at part 13. What game are you making? Return to Yoshi's Island? Did you join the stream without knowing what I was doing? Why are you here? What are you expecting from this channel? Have you been here before? How hard is it to code for N64? Easy. All programming is easy. No, it's not necessary to code. If you use like ROM manager or whatever. I should import some kind of temporary skybox here. Because this is kind of hard to look at. Let's add a temporary skybox. God, I had so much stuff to do today. Holy shit. I spent so much time on my sound engine. That like... Basically, I'm trying to fix Mario 64 sound engine. It sucks. I'm kind of just ripping it out, making my own. And it's been a serious effort. I've probably spent the last four or five days non-stop on it. But I have made huge performance improvements. I have reduced the code size by probably like five kilobytes at this point. I have made a lot of bug fixes that make it a lot easier to make a game with the engine. And now I am working on just getting it all wrapped up. There's still a few memory allocations that I want to change. So we have a bit of more memory free. And once that all is done, we're going to have such a much more stronger sound engine compared to the vanilla game. It's going to be crazy. So this is where the Yoshi village is supposed to be with the houses. It does not look good. Why does everyone say this all looks good? It looks like absolute garbage. It's not when you're finished. Of course it doesn't look good. You tried to make Mario in chat? That looks like a keyboard to me. Anyway, any OST wishes today? Dude, what happened to my YouTube? Are you guys seeing this? Why is it all this guy? My YouTube is all this guy. Red detective boogie. Heads up guys, there's someone offering me a free smartphone if I do a 6 minute review of it on my second channel. And I am going to do that because I do. I have a Samsung S6 and I need a new phone. This one's giving up. So there will be a 6 minute review of some random phone from Hong Kong. Which phone? I don't know. Anyway, this overworld is big and it sucks. I feel like we had more plans for this. Right, the whole Bowser drill thing. I forgot about that. There's going to be somewhere here where Bowser is drilling into this drill hole. It says I can get past the mechanics magical barrier. Alright, so there's going to be a magical barrier here and a drill hole. I would hope it's an Android. I only want an Android or a Google phone. I do not want the Bill Gates phone. I think I have more boats to the area I want back. Maybe a player will actually get his own boat or perhaps there's a boat.  There's probably going to be more docks too. That's kind of like a minor detail for now. We need to get the big strokes right first. Okay, we have a problem. Boshi's platform is here, but then Bill's drill is here. And Boshi being right next to the drill is all awkward I think. Maybe Boshi should be shooting the shit somewhere else. What a shame it's unused. Oh, is this a song request? I'm guessing it's a song request. No, it wasn't the center of the island. No, the drill was from here and he was trying to drill towards the center of the island. So it's going to be this direction here. And then you need... ...enough stars to get past the barrier. I'm trying to think of how to actually visually do this. How do we make sure the player knows it's a drill, but also the barrier keeps them out? That's a good question. The world is done layout-wise, yes. Well, except for maybe this part here. Other than that, it's all done layout-wise. The inside of the drill tunnel is going to be a level. What even is the problem with that? Well, if you see the drill, then the drill is halfway through the magical barrier. Isn't that going to look weird? And if it's not halfway through the magic barrier, how are you going to see the drill? I guess you could see it behind the magical barrier. There we go. Yeah, let's try something like that. So first of all, I want to make this smaller, because right now this kind of sucks. Back to red, back to blue key. Level 4 Level 5 Level 6 Level 7 Level 8 Level 9 Level 10 Level 11 And I think that would work really well with the drill idea. You should try this funny video when you're done. I'm just going to do the same thing again. Roger scammed you out of some requests? No way! I got scammed? Why would you do this to me, Akirai? I thought you were one of the good ones. It's only been a couple of days, and damn, what are you doing, Srinivasa? I am glad you like it. Did you find me from one of my new videos? Maybe? I've been making a lot more videos. Speaking of which, dude, I'm working with an agency to get new sponsors for my videos. That's the reason I'm making videos now, because I have sponsors and I need to make videos. Usually I don't make videos. Because they're expensive to make. And they cost a lot of money. They cost more than they make usually. But something's fucked up, and now I don't know whether I'm actually going to get paid or not, which would be devastating. Are you scared that they will take down the game? No. I mean, they might, but like... If it happens, it happens. It's not the end of the world. I can still just turn it into my own branded game, hopefully. I'm going to use it as PR and make something even more interesting. More famous. Powersoft. I guess good afternoon. I am in Nova Scotia, so afternoon is about right. It's 2pm. Is there anyone going? Well... We need this to go to 3A. And then... 4. I hope my agency sorts their shit out. And then also, they're not properly paying sales tax. Apparently. I don't know, man. They need to lock in. I don't know, man.   I don't know. I am in Canada. Why is RenderInfo.bg missing now? I'm like 100% sure I linked this up right. What the hell? So a drill hole there fits pretty well, I think. I am with an agency called LFI. And they do bring in a lot of deals. It's just that something always goes wrong. And I'm not sure if it's their fault or not. I was convinced it's Squarespace's fault that they fucked it up. But then they also fucked up my invoice. So now I'm not sure anymore, which sucks. Did you guys see that 4chan got hacked? And that apparently 4chan was a fucking government psyop somehow? I think that's crazy. I mean... Why is the emptiness repeating the last text that was in this position? Because the background's not rendering. I am trying to add a temp skybox. That's what I've been doing the last 2 minutes. It just doesn't work for some reason. Ah! I think it's because I didn't add another Far Awayness entry. There we go. Don't like fortune? No, I think it's a time... It's a website for losers that just need to waste their time somehow, because they have nothing to live for. Same with Reddit, by the way. No, it has not gone downhill. It's always been like this. No, I'm not sure what kind of rumor that is. ...by the US government to make conspiracy... to make people that have conspiratorial thinking look stupid. They put out the dumbest possible theories, so that if you actually have like a good theory, you are being grouped in with the dumbest possible theories. Vlad didn't say just Reddit is for losers. Reddit Nation Assemble! This man will never look at a cute papa ever again after we beat them up. They are often real and often wrong. Okay, what the fuck does often mean to you? Could use the like Skybox engine from like Jet Force... Hey, what's wrong with my Skybox? What do you mean Skybox engine? It's just one random matrix. Are there any signs or reasons you use to find inspiration for level designs? No. Can you use the jumping engine from... The jumping engine. Okay, I think the drill hole here is good. This kind of removes Bosch's pole dust that could be here, but this is still such a gigantic empty area. So, here's where the detailing work comes in. We need to think of things we want on the island. Well, if you go to Reddit to get the answer to a question, that's one thing. If you go on there to scroll, that's loser behavior. Yeah, anyway, we need things we want on the island. So I think I already made a few notes for this. We need some special world events that happen every few stars. Okay, I have that. Osman, here's the map. Bubbles near the edges, we got that. Did I write down the bar idea? Oh, the fruit juice bar is in Course 8. Okay, a hospital. That would be fitting, right? Other things that we need on the island. So, Yoshi Hospital. How would the Yoshi Hospital look like? Yoshi Hospital, let me Google this. Please don't be porn. Please don't be porn. It is not porn. Awesome. Okay, but this is just hospitalized Yoshis. Not really what we're looking for. The Yosh-pital, exactly. There's an enemy farm to fill out space, like the Yoshis use them as food. Somewhat fitting, yes. I mean, the Yoshis heal from eating fruit, right? So the hospital would just be a fruit stand, I guess. Actually, no, they heal from eating flowers. What should we need again? Yeah, I'm just thinking of things that we can place to fill out the space a little bit and give this more personality. Because there's a lot of empty stuff here. So I'd like to think of things we can put in here. To, you know, make this feel more like a place where people live. I haven't answered the guy yet, because I'm too busy with shit. I can't get into a conversation with him right now. Oh, yes, a playground would be cool. How would the Yoshi playground look like? Could there be one here? I guess we can have some basic playground toys there, right? Like a seesaw. Maybe you ground pound the seesaw to make the Yoshi go up. And then the Yoshi ground pounds inside to make you go up or something. Yeah, like a seesaw or the spinning thing where you walk on and it spins. They could probably all just give you five coins for doing it. A little swing set with some Yoshis swinging on it. What if there were empty swings? And then after you save the Yoshis, some Yoshis swing on them. Yes, there's 20 stars on the map so far. Yoshi coins on the island? Absolutely not. The island's way too big for that. Let's do that. I think part three. There are swings here. The swings are empty until you beat the one at which point two Yoshis will be swinging on them. And then we have 13. Seesaw toy. There's a Yoshi on the seesaw. Ground pound to the side. Opposite of him to move them up. He will then ground pound the other side which shoots you upwards. I like that. That should be a hidden star. What if there was a seesaw and you had to ground pound it over and over until the Yoshi shoots you high enough for a secret star? I want that. I'm putting that somewhere. It's too fun. Or this could just be a shortcut. Shortcut or a star. You have to keep in mind, Mario 64 placed fucking totes in the overworld that just gifted you stars. I think if we have 41 secret overworld stars instead of 21 for a 200 total star count, I think that's fine. You're getting into Odyssey, Moon Territory? You are also right about that. Maybe that should just be a shortcut then. Okay, I'm going to use that as a shortcut. This spinning thing where you have to walk on it to move it gives you a blue coin. Stars in side levels is like cramming them on the island. So are you thinking that would enter side level and that would give you a star? Or what's the idea? Wait, I forgot about this. Last stream I wanted to brainstorm more mechanics that can be turned into side levels. A playground side level is fun. The issue I have with it is it's too much work. At this point I don't want to add side levels that add that much work to the project. If anything I want the side levels that we now add to the project to be side levels that are based on a mechanic we already have. That is fun to re-experience and that are pretty short. Imagine. Imagine. It's a manta ray on a beach. You climb on it, follow a trail of coins into the ocean and it takes you to a manta ray serpent side level. Something like that. While there's already two secret things about the manta ray, so maybe not exactly the manta ray. But I like the way you're thinking. While there's already two secret things about the manta ray, so maybe not exactly the manta ray. Well, or we could add a third manta ray secret level and just say fuck it. And it would literally just be a large plane of water with some boxes stuck in it and some red coins.  Right? Is that how we will think about it? Yeah, let's do it. Single mechanic levels. We're not even calling them side levels, we're calling them single mechanic levels.  You get a manta ray ice flower, can you go around the entire island? No. No, I didn't program it like that. There's like this whole stretch here where I haven't really done anything and like there's walls like this. I will still make it so the bubba eats you. The problem also is if you could do that, then you could get the ice flower here and like walk right here and skip over one. Okay. That's something more like a Sonic Rush adventure type thing. Hmm, so would you just try to go fast here, I guess? I'm not really sure this works well with the manta ray because there's no speed boost or anything like that. Hello, chili. It's a straight-line outrunner and you're trying to, with an obstacle, collect coins. But does that work with the manta ray, really? I think we can write this down for now. So would there just be eight red coins and you try to collect them while going in a straight line? So you want this to be a timed section then, I guess? Timed linear section between boys plus level limiters. Let me see. I think we're gonna have to do this a timed one just so we have a visual representation of what the goal is. What's a new mechanic? The boys? That's just gonna be a collision. Just so that we actually have a game. Oh, I see. Yeah, it's a new mechanic. We'd have to explain. That's why I don't want that. I'd rather just have a timer counting down because that already happens in the game in multiple places. Play boys and not move the lever on Mario. How does this make any sense? I don't get it. True, you could do that, Biomag. I think I prefer a timer, though. It's just easier for me. You know what? It actually does feel like this plain thing. Fine. We'll make it a plain thing. Oh, but then you have both the timer and the coins. That's a little much, is it not? What if we just have a timer and a coin? What if we just had red coins and a timer? And the thing is small enough that you can go around it twice before the time runs out? So you have two shots at each red coin? Hmm. But there's nothing really stopping the player from turning around. Turning around would suck. We'll deal with them in some time. I think it has to be a timer. The other idea just has that issue. I think it has to be a timer. The other idea just has that issue. You can just control left or right. Then we have to make a whole new Manta Ray. No, it should be the same Manta Ray controls. I am fairly certain of that. Yeah, I think we have to go in the timelinear section. Unfortunately. The rest is just too weird. Let's say Manta Ray randomly shows up here after beating Act 3 in 2-Pulse Wave. Oh, I think that's a good way to do it. Let's think about other mechanical levels we can do. Let's think about other mechanical levels we can do. Alright, let's see, bunny wave, bunny brush, is there any mechanic here that could be used? For real, should I be mixing the baby yoshi and minecart mechanics? I can't combine the mechanics, like code wise, it just doesn't work. But the minecart is a very good one, I like the minecart. Should we reuse the minecart mechanic? Like a minecart level? I like that. Minecart level, just get to the end. Alright, let's think about this though, let's go star by star. Trouble Town Tour, nope, Food Fights, nope, Boss the Goombas, nope, Sunflower Sky Slide, it's a slide. Slides are very easy to do. Well it's also mashing the button, but you are right, Biobank, but I think it's worth it just for the cool theme. I think nothing else here, Koopa Wave Golf, sneak past the seagulls, there is no real mechanic here, Lighthouse Rumble, that's a boss fight, Star Festival, that's with the manta ray surfing, where do you have that, Koopa Golf Competition is a race, Rooftop Rats, Hot Toast Butterfly, nope. We'll have to see if we can do Cool Island Rainbow Tunnel from the cave level. Yeah, I think we can come up with something. Also, also, also, that means we could probably, if we do go with the minecart level, we could hide that in here, somehow, it would be very fitting. Okay, minecart, we wrote it down, nope, nope, Cloud Cap, we should have a Cloud Cap level somewhere. The problem with the Cloud Cap level is that you enter the level and what if you don't have the Cloud Cap? I can't give the player the Cloud Cap in the overworld because that breaks everything. So, what we'll have to do is, somehow, well, we could make it so that you enter the Cloud Cap and then the first thing that happens is you need the Cloud Cap to make progress, and if you don't have it you just exit the course, which leads you right back to the exit. Yeah, I think that works. So, let's note it down, Cloud Cap level, maybe some Sky Fortress, Worms would be cool. Also note down, if you don't have the Cloud Cap, you can't leave the starting platform and have to come back later. Are you from Germany? But now I live in Canada. What happened to the Green Japanese Garden side level? Marty is still working on it. I'm freestyling over the music. Yeah, I'm kind of bringing the heat. Make a text boss battle if you don't have the cap? Nope. I think the player has two brain cells, they can figure it out. Sneak to the Penguin Peak. This has the Bob-omb Guardians. This side would get crazy with the visual effects. True. We could have a rainbow slide. We're brainstorming which mechanics we can reuse to make a single mechanic focused side level. Do we just do a rainbow slide? I'm not really sure what you're envisioning under the visuals, but we can just do it. Rainbow slide, just do a slide, Bob. You have at least one slide level, that's true. Well, we have a couple slides, but not a dedicated slide level. So, fair enough. We wrote down Clark Cap, Infinite Happy Hole? Nope. Tech Cards on the Radar? Nope. Sneak to the Penguin Peak, right. A stealth level. So Sneak to the Penguin Peak is a stealth level about evading Bob-omb Guards in a jail. Right, we now have two slide levels either. I forgot. It's not done yet though, is it? Do I want a stealth level? How would this work? Where would this be? We do have the Bob-omb Factory here, so this would be the prime candidate for a stealth level. Need something more to add? Oh, I see. I should maybe have time again on fucking Friday, dude. Oh my god, I'm so busy. People love the stealth level, so maybe we should go for it. Didn't they hate it? I made so many changes to the stealth mechanic because I thought people hated the stealth mechanic in Lost Impact. Being sarcastic? I see. Yeah, that's why I initially only wanted one stealth section, because the feeling of it is fun, but the gameplay of it is often not fun. That's why in this game the stealth section is very forgiving, comparatively. Okay, so maybe not. Vully Wrecks Vario, Antarctica Expedition. I think Antarctica Expedition is going to be one of the most hated stars. No, I don't see anything here. I don't want to add any new code for this. I just want to reuse what I already have. This is a fun one, Climb the Crow's Nest. I don't see anything here either. What do you even do in Dino Lady's Baby? I completely forgot. I think you bring back the egg or something. Peacharitis? What does that mean? Enemy wave side level? I think that's a bit boring. Pile the Porky Parts? Definitely not suitable. Seek the Shy Guys, where you play hide and seek. I think a pure hide and seek level would be very fun, but I don't see it working right now. Go to an Underwater Red Coins level? It's literally... Wait, Discord rules? Did they remove that rule? There was a rule here against Underwater Red Coin levels. It was a bannable offense in my Discord. I would love a hide and seek level. You have to find like 10 Shy Guys in a big map. Oh. That feels also like sarcasm. Unless my sarcasm detector today is just inverted. Not genuinely? Oh. Huh. How would the world look like though? What kind of world could we make without putting way too much effort into it? What? Put effort into the visuals? We're limited on bio back time though. Well, I guess I still have a lot of stuff to do as well. So where would this location be, since you seem to be passionate for it? Get anything more specific in mind? It just seems kind of miserable to seek out 10 Shy Guys on a level like that. What are you Wirkung on right now? Overworld. We're brainstorming some mechanical side levels. That's already a side level to battle. I'm not referencing Squid Games. I hate Squid Games. Alon Bubble Dome is going to be located in the underground tunnels here. There's going to be a submarine that you can get into and that will lead you to the level. That's a neat way to make a stealth level. Correct, yeah. That's one way to make it very forgiving. It's very obvious in what the visual cone is. Now that I see this, you know what? I'm adding a visual cone like that to the Bob-Omb guards. Hello Caleb. Do you not have a side level where you race NPCs? It could be in an area surrounding a volcano. There is a race, but there's not a side level for a race. The hide and seek would be so much fun. Really? But wouldn't you spend so much time just walking around, not knowing where to go? I imagined it quite miserable right now. I just don't see it. How are so many people pinging me all the time? Galaxy tutorial with the rabbits. So they would have like... Wait, let me watch that again. Okay. How is he going to find all three bunnies in 40 seconds when he plays like this? He isn't going to find the bunnies, is he? Rosalina? God damn, they made the bunnies hard to catch. What? That looks so difficult. Oh, they just slowed down after a while and now he's stupid. Shoot, those are snoots. Let me see. Oh, I see. You're right. And they are grunts, but you have to find them instead of reach them. Hmm. Yeah, hide and seek in like a mushroom area would be cool. Maybe it should be a mushroomy foresty area. That could absolutely exist around here somewhere, maybe at the base of the tree. Oh, at the base of the tree is cool. Imagine it being like a circle around the tree. Hmm. Okay, fine. We'll do it. Okay. Okay. No, it's going to be a side level, not an overlap area. So it's going to be very separate. This is a red detective boogie. Five shine guys. They make sounds, so they are easy to find. I should also add sounds to this. I'm not adding to your notes. Hmm. Hmm. All right, let's see what else we have. Fearsome Funhouse. What was this, a victory museum? Ancient Arcane Metroid. This is such a cool level. This level is very charming, I think.  Arrest the Acorn Thief. This is a weird mission. Trash pile travel. Nope. Egg on a roll. That's a good one to have. An egg roll level. I don't know if we can do it with exactly an egg again. Maybe just with a ball. Hmm. Let me think about how this would look like. Mario is on an egg and he's running on the egg and rolling it around. Don't you want a different name for a black coin star? Maybe. I haven't really thought about it yet. The reason it's called Egg Coins on the radar right now is so people look at the radar, but obviously with the tutorial that won't be required anymore. You have to just do it, Galop. There's no trick to it. Does the font have all the names for Horus World? No, it doesn't. I think I like the egg roll one. It's going to be like the galaxy ones where you roll on the ball and get somewhere. It could be on a beach ball or something. Let me think whether that would fit. A pirate cannonball. Yeah. All rolling minigame in a pinball. We have to avoid the bumps. Oh, so they will kick you down. And it's a whole pinball machine that you have to go down on. That's cool. But where can we place that? Do you jump into a pinball machine? Is there going to be a secret arcade here somewhere? Okay, there's an arcade. All right. So what if there's just a giant arcade building and as soon as you go in there, that's just a secret level. Like, fuck it. Maybe you have to pay admission fee. Let's do it. Admission fee. I like that. Who will be messaging me again? Yo, my Squarespace issue just got resolved. Let's fucking go. No, it won't even be jumping in the cage. It will just you walk into an arcade. I'm a fan of random buildings on the island feels less impacty. I see what you mean. But is it random? Is it really random if it's like part of the lore that the yoshis just have an arcade i guess it doesn't really fit the yoshis does it can we make the arcade yoshi themed maybe to solve this problem this conundrum conundrum is problem by the way it's just what you say when you want to sound smart sorry i don't know where i'm getting getting these thoughts from someone's just beaming them into my mind so this is what she's played from now scenario on the island where an arcade machine would make sense well it would be like an entire arcade building and i mean i guess there is this whole yoshi area here where we can place many many buildings we have a lot of empty area here that we need to fill with something so if there was like a building here like inside this wall instead of the wall where you could jump in to play arcade games i think that would be good or it could be anywhere on this beach here or it could maybe be like here so there's plenty of areas to place it um avoid bumpers that will shoot you off how would a yoshi arcade look like a yoshi themed arcade do and how does bowser's arcade look like like this okay that's way too flashy no we want the mechanics based rookie there's some levels and themes for now we'll set up the details and placement later yeah but i do kind of want or already at least think about the entrance because for all of the ones it's pretty easy to do just for this one i can't think of anything yet we get it the sky was my grandfather the raven boss fight or is it still just blank it is still just blank so well i guess we have a backup now so that's good um the entrance is in the arcade building all right let's keep going through our levels we're only on crusade take your oh pick your power i forgot about that the level where we have those three power-ups you get and they are only used here that's kind of bizarre isn't it that we just have three different power-ups that you can only use in the tree they should be reused somehow with some random platforming level if you have a level where you need to use all three well the idea with them is that they all give you powers that allow you to just jump further i don't think it makes sense to force the player to use all three that would require really weird geometry bye evan just thinking of a theme for this would something mountainous be good maybe like a canyon what if you fall down the canyon maybe this would work well in one of the cloud overworlds where it's like a canyon above the clouds and then when you fall it's just death i haven't really thought about a rideable yoshi yet wouldn't it be crazy to just have him in one side level and then never again though like them we don't use child shredding in this game no to fit the powers more like giving the player all three powers one after the other instead of letting you pick one they prefer i see i see i see that definitely works but i like the idea of pick your power also feels like it should be a timed level because you have to pick the power but like the difficult to use powers are faster and the easy to use power-ups are slower but safer so a power thing like being that feels good to me it seems like a good idea so it's kind of like a little bit of risk management we could just put this in a cave i think it works well in the cave if we pick your power fruits in the cave level time star and you have to manage your risk like anti-gravity slides do you mean like a low gravity slide or like how are you managing this feels like a lot of overlap with course 15 because course 15 is already almost a pure platforming level so i kind of don't think that's maybe the best option all alone bubble dom oh we have the deep sea shell here and of course the bomb cap but i don't think that works for the first start but the shell we have the shell diving we should do something with that maybe a race against the shark or something maybe you can find this in the underground tunnels maybe there's like an underground shark and he's like yeah you want a race kit come follow me yeah t-time i think it's gonna be 200 right now we're just thinking of like little side levels that we could put these side levels are all like one day of effort but then you reuse a mechanic from earlier during the game so this is one two three four five six seven that would bring us to 186 stars so one day of effort for you fair enough i'm collapsing cave level this is not reusing a mechanic i think i'll do the race against the shark um shell diving race against the shark so you're level still in the game yes but the entry is at the north side well then um sky guest tab nothing hunger highness nothing i guess came nothing poochie puzzle nothing i think nothing in my opinion nothing we should be using again yeah i think this is fine will you modify all the troops definitely not the great again and nope this one's too story focused there's no unique mechanics to this grins and badland i think grins and badland right now is by far the worst level we have in the game grins and badland needs to change a lot i'm mainly the outlines uh the outskirts and the milk bar needs to be easier to find so you want to start with those three toads who all played events and you need to bring them together stone plant oh i completely forgot about that nope that's just not part of the plan anymore what's wrong with it you enter the level and you kind of have no fucking idea what to do and you kind of you learn what you're supposed to do in the level as soon as you enter the dairy bar the problem is players are not finding it because it's like hip kind of and the outskirts are so huge with like nothing to do except the mission in there and there's a huge chance that you miss the mission and then you're just like on a big empty field not knowing what to do so there's a good chance that your first time experiencing grins and badland for the first 25 minutes you just run around and get progressively more miserable two issues that are easy to solve but they need to be solved the scavenger hunt is a fun mission so the scavenger hunt works you ground pound somewhere there's a sign that shows up and it tells you somewhere else to go that's true there is one toad in the game when you die actually no koopa wave kove has a bunch of toads so like the ice palace and the overworld thing epic bar to use it twice i don't want to use it a third time anyway i think the scavenger hunt is fun and the scavenger hunt should have a star  what if we had one scavenger hunt star that worked across the entire overworld um yeah i think grins and badland has um potential it's just not done well right now so i agree by the way i was gonna say that too will mario be able to swim all the way around the outside of the island by swinging the water around the island no there's going to be huge babas that will eat you if you go out because i don't want to deal with having to program that so the first thing could be somewhere along here and then the next thing could be like the highest mushroom and then you grunt up the highest mushroom and then the next thing after that could be something like uh well we can make landmarks for the scavenger hunt the funny idea for the scavenger hunt what is it there is a scavenger hunt across the entire overworld um that's the song sonic adventure 2 battle uh i think dry lagoon so you can scallops in a sec this scallop still working on a hack are you the dry bones guy will rtyi be open source on release yes definitely i do want people to use my engine to make more romhacks and to improve on my performance optimizations i have some angles beyond them we'll just hit them with walls or something they will eat you you will not go beyond them no scallops what no way i feel like i would have heard of that how's he done he hasn't uploaded in over a year and then here's the demo after 12 years and it's just the first overworld how's he done that's depressing so we can find a little bump in the ground in the ground pun it turns out it's a mole trying to sleep because you can't even sleep in peace on the island i'm going to take a nap in cryptic relation you better leave me alone i'm chasing across the island what if you want to re-listen to the hint because you missed it the first time what if you forget what he said Forgotten Fortress doesn't even have star names yet because we're still waiting for Zeno to finish the last area see what are the stars here could be a hole next to the bump and when you stomp the bump he sheds out the hole instead still doesn't make sense this is early on but can't reach right the snowman cave path right boss fight should we reuse the planetary gravity somehow for a star i think it's kind of too cool of a concept to not reuse you're right biobank but i can't think of a better option i'm working on the overworld solomon how do i make planetary gravity into a fun star okay eight red coins on a planet and the planet has like actual geometry on it this time yay nay however that's not scary for programming it's scary for wall collision we're gonna have to slightly tilt the walls so that no matter what angle you approach them from there's still walls that's gonna be a little foggy we're gonna have to make it a pretty big planet yeah does that always come up the mechanics introduce the main courses no yeah i think i'll do the planet side level um big planetary gravity planet with some simple geometry on it collecting red coins on it no enemies just driving in space doing it somehow hello shane if you want to expand on the mini planet idea verticality would probably be a logical expansion of the idea yep that would be a lot of verticality so from my perspective right now you are just schizo posting and i have no idea what you're talking about like 90 percent of the time you type in this chat cosmic capital we have squid square rocket great crop climb aqua ascension aqua ascension has potential the moving water bubbles i feel like the only thing that makes the raven planet thrilling is the new gravity the player already played a level with this mechanic the boss fight will be underwhelming hmm yeah all right fine we'll only open it after you beat the level i can easily do that entrance is only available after the raven was beaten pirate treasure hunt one of the dead pirates from the ship shows up at some point he tells you i buried the star i planned that somewhere on this island if i remember correctly it's in cryptic location then you go there and you find someone in the bullshit like a toothbrush or something he appears next to you oh i must have remembered wrong i know it's a new cryptic location you're going to unearth all those belongs after you've had to stop yes okay that works okay can we listen to this Hint by going to this ship opens up after beating the shy guy boss on course five i think that's good dude there's so many people moving into the overworld now it's like every time you beat the level one person from the level just decides to visit yoshi's island and i like it a lot more views than your official github twitch dang case for earl ir if we get planetary graffiti where would you even place it it seems out of place unless in a cave where you get a secret rocket spot don't worry about it little boy right it has to appear i think it's fine if it's all before the ship or we could make it so that two years after you beat the shy guy boss on course five and also open pandora's box which requires the second overworld to be unlocked that way we have like almost all of this we have like all this area available to us just not the last part here this one too i think that's fine so don't worry about it oh my god don't piss yourself every time i say something let's maximum amount of coins mario will be able to carry will it be 999 or something let's check that's what it is 9999 that's what i limited it to so aqua ascension aqua ascension has floating water bubbles and i think floating water bubbles have a lot of potential for more stuff but also i don't see what stuff by myself this song is flying the freedom hello artsy animations so yes actually i had uh i paid zell to make some changes to missing link and i'm going to make that another video because squarespace is gonna pay me so okay i don't think anything in handmaid heights works so that is one two three four five six seven eight nine okay now we have 30 we have 189 stars planned now and i think we're we're not planning anymore because while we're going to make the overworld we are for sure going to have more ideas and i think if we get one more star we have 190 if we get 11 more stars we have 200 i just don't want to end up with like 192 stars it was for six videos yeah and yeah hopefully really soon he he made this fix like what four months ago i just haven't gotten around to making the video yet okay we still haven't done this yet other things that need to be on the island i wanted a juice bar how about a flower farmer fuck that there's a flower farmer a guy farming flowers in the flower garden yoshi's love flower gardens can poochie be on the overworld poochie can be on the overworld but i don't see what he would do i just gotta think of random stuff to add basically shy guy farmer from space no they're enemies he chills do you're gonna have poochie appear here after you've beaten the poochie mission in course two and then maybe when you stand on him he runs around the world and picks up coins or something that's a very funny idea i'm not sure i want to import wiggler but if i was willing to do the work i'd probably go through with it okay fuck it i will add poochie after beating the poochie mission in course two poochie no longer spawns there and does that he lives in the overworld when you step on his head he walks to a random spot and picks up one singular coin just once a guy who quit his job at the oil rig that's a funny idea he would have to be here somewhere let's do it all right free of oily boring bay a guy who quits his job there and just lives on yoshi's island looking for new work he should do something for coins yeah i suppose this yacht is gonna be out here when you just go there with a manta ray but you can't get there normally because it's all oily and you take damage when you go there so what work would the guy look for he's he's used to manual labor so yeah you can buy new decorations from he should definitely be yeah yeah that would fit i'm kind of having a hard time thinking of overall decorations to buy  a pinball machine for example oh i see what you mean so i guess he could build a pinball machine here all right if i'm good we'll do that for 1000 coins or something like that all right that works um anyway i was thinking of things to add to the overworld to make it less empty and not really new missions or whatever oh yeah we have a cool pinball machine idea this is dude i keep saying this but this time this time the pinball machine is gonna be good trust me guys it's not gonna be like the last 15 times this one is gonna be good for real what about fruit on the island do we want to go with giant fruit because um mario party here she is there's a lot of this stuff this is what it looks like oh they have such pretty britches so they have like zero ideas is this supposed to be a yoshi house  yeah this whole thing is barren of ideas that's crazy it's just the idea of hey what if fruit let me let me actually watch to see if i can find anything that i like here hello nintendo for life do you guys agree that the new mario parties have way too many boosts and way way too slow of a pace i think that's my two big issues with it the minigames in it are so good so yeah there's like nothing in here well they haven't changed the formula they have just frustration minimize the game to a point where suddenly what made the game fun is gone yeah you're getting so many coins that's why the move is so prevalent i think i'm really a mario party guy damn fair enough though no matter which mario party i'm thinking of like the idea of playing it is always kind of dreadful  yeah i don't see anything here  we got the pirate invasion and some flower fields here i think we need to think of more buildings that the yoshis would have more stuff that they would have around swings they would have swings not swings um hang a mutter what's the english word hang a mutter english hammocks thank you do we have the stork on the island i would think he'd be retired now but both the chameleons tanked his 4k and now he's homeless this dork i wasn't thinking of using the stork anywhere but he would be funny the yoshi dmv and tree houses i like tree houses i'm a little worried about the camera uh if we make a tree house but maybe if we don't let the player go inside it would be fine i think this stretch of land here is like my least favorite part right now and there's something we need to do about it do we have an illegal machine gun factor well that would be legal because they they are the politicians here big dark house eh not a big fan to be honest  there should be more pachyderm around pachyderm is a funny guy i think we should have them somewhere else like they don't even really do anything they're just kind of really annoying warehouse with a shit ton of wool i don't get why but fuck it let's do it oh because of yoshi's woolly world farmer's markets i could see a farmer's market i'm not sure if they're civilized enough for that you know i don't think the yoshis have money they would only ever use money for the outside world yoshi society between each other they don't have money yoshi copter landing pad that is funny but no oh some cute little boats some small boats with crafting something with this wool can't tell you what yet i won't be ready for a few years i like that in the mario 64 ocarina of time romhack at the bottom of the well there's a guy that says man i can hear something coming from the bottom of the well i wonder if that is the breath of the wild because you know b-o-t-w bottom of the well and we have a few playground parts yoshis eat meat yoshis are not civilized they do not have a moral compass they just happen to be friendly people they have no issue with crimes against humanity they just have no urge to commit those so all right i think we have a good couple fun ideas we're gonna think about where to put these next and then we're finally gonna uv map some of this so we can have a better overview of what what is and close the mountains but for today i have a lot of stuff to do and i have to quit stream for now so i will see you guys next stream bye bye probably tomorrow
