Room, broom. Hello, Biobak. All right, that's a shirt I'm wearing. TeePublic was supposed to link my new merch store to YouTube like two days ago, but they still haven't. So now you can't get the shirt, which is very sad, unless you like go off the website. Hello, Mimowski. Oops, wrong button. You know what, I will just be safe, because that was a weird pop-up I had there. Asset import today? Yes, yes, yes. So I did a little bit of work on this off-stream. Oops, that's on the wrong speaker. Let me show you what I did. I did nothing too exciting. I tried to do all the stuff that requires programming first. So of course I fixed the Yoshi thing up there. But I also did this part here. Oh no, I hear punishments. I finished this part right here. Uh-oh. That's pretty cool, isn't it? And the egg now has some level of rubber banding, so it gets faster as you go further ahead, which keeps this exciting. Got some flames here. Yeah. I think you can make that jump. Yeah, now there's just this big egg here. I tried to recreate the lights you had on the egg. It's the stage lights. And it doesn't look quite perfect, but I think it's pretty close to it. The atmosphere of this place here is impeccable. Like, what a cool place to be in. Hello, dashboard. Wait, someone's stemming me. This might be important. Oh, never mind. It's not. All right, now we keep going on importing Biomex assets. The upstairs could be a decent LST, but I kind of want to listen to something I already know. I want to look around in the basement for his idol. Yeah, that'd be very fitting. Well, we're doing the disco ball later because it requires a lot of programming. Dr. Mario block. I really call them Dr. Mario blocks. What shall we listen to? The action is pretty good. I actually think Yoshi is hiding from the IRS. Like, wouldn't he be hiding from Japanese authorities? I don't know why people act like the IRS is worse than other countries' tax authorities. I feel like, if anything, they're more likes. I should model for this as well. Should we do this? Mario3D.OST. All right, let's do it. We're listening to the Mario 3D World beautiful music compilation. Fair enough. I want the ride. I hate that it does that. It's so annoying. Wait, can I not just change that in the repo settings? Terrain undefined here. Terrain undefined here. Okay, well, first of all, it's in the wrong level. So that would do something. But how is it undefined? Yeah, that's how. This is Snowman's Land, right, Kristen? Yep, okay. I'll just delete the failed import here. So I noticed off stream that there was one part of the overworld that we kind of skipped and I finished that part now. So the overworld is back to where we left off. And after the overworld is done, we are going to keep working on that after this level is done. Oh, I did not mean to show that. Oh, well, now you know the videos I have planned. So come on. There we go. Wait, do those have a culling area? 266. Does that make sense? That is not enough. 330. That's the wrong level. Dude, I was working on some really bad collision bugs recently. I did the sickest thing ever. This is actually a thing I'm really proud of. So you know how when you're on a platform like this, what do you think happens if I walk to the left? If I walk to the left at full speed, what will happen to Mario? Will he A. Just kind of like fly off? Or B. Will he start walking down the slope? Do you have like an intuition of what should be happening? Well, to answer the riddle, what is going to happen in vanilla Mario, sometimes he is going to walk down and sometimes he's going to fly off. It is essentially random because it depends on where exactly in the frame you are. If you are like here, like if you reach the point around here, you would stay on. But if you walked far enough down to where you would be ending up here or something, you would fly off. Because it depends on your exact speed. Whether you are not far enough walking off to meet more than 78 coordinates off the floor. So I made it consistent so that he like always sticks on. Because you could also make it consistent so that he always flies off. And for slides, that means you can always just like walk on the slides. Which this is a lot nicer because now you know what's going to happen. Instead of it being literally random. I feel like there never should be any randomness in Mario's movement. Interesting, let's see, I see. You know what, at least it's like consistently wrong. I have to set it to the exact position of the spawn here, which is 100 coordinates. There was clearly an issue with this material here. Okay, it makes sense to only have lightning on the sides. Because these are the only ones that would actually look different. Let's see if here's the answer you've gotten so far. You can't go beyond 60. The N64 has a hard limit of 60, unfortunately. So something feels very wrong about this. Like it's in the floor when it's not meant to be. Hello, Skull Gamer. Yeah, what did I do here? Got stuck. Oh no. There are certain problems with this. So I'm thinking these are all supposed to be like one coordinates in the air. Maybe. 4, 6, 4. Did the same thing happen? Damn. All right, they're definitely buggy. That happens with engine upgrades. All stuff just goes buggy over time. But fortunately, we're basically done upgrading the engine. So that shouldn't be happening anymore. Soon. Hey, it works! Sorry that I spalled. This will be a tough puzzle for you guys. You will not be able to do this puzzle anymore. Okay, that's good to know. And I know that down in my box list. Oh, there is a lot of bugs in this level already noted down. Wow. Block puzzle in Jitter. Block puzzle in Unpushable. The block puzzle. That's the most fucked up spell block I've ever seen. Anyway, we're not here to bug fix. We are here to import everything. Oh, I see. We got three different deck gates. Okay, this will be something. Okay. Actually, this doesn't mean it's collision-reported, because they're the same, right? I have no idea how he works with snapping at this. Oh, she sent me a new F3 thumbnail. This is kind of a banger. I kinda like it. Oh, we already had that last year. Well, we probably need something more on the thumbnail to make sure people know it's about like fan games. But it already is a pretty good base. We're planning to step into F3. Nice! That's good. Keep that up. Yeah, obviously these would open to the sides then. Is there a case to scrub? There is! I don't think I linked my Discord anywhere on YouTube actually. I never tried to get people into the Discord. Now that I think about it, I don't know what the reason there is that I even have a Discord. Could bombs fit in this stage? Or B-bombs? Which one are we talking about? Because I do not know what a B-bomb is, but I know what a bomb is. Yeah, looks perfect. Almost. Whoa. Okay, something's going wrong with the positioning. That thing has no visuals. Pushing it almost looks perfect. Okay, a few issues to iron out. I see. Oh, you actually like made them three-dimensional like that. That would do it. Wait, is this centered? Okay. That's way offset. Yeah, I see why. I just kind of prefer it like this because it makes my job a lot easier placing them down. Then I don't think they know what Booba is. When you say Booba was typing, it sounds like nonsense to them. This primitive color thing is here again. It's like everywhere. Oh, and Nuava. That would explain why it was pure black. Okay, so something's wrong with the collision too. And Bubby. Okay. Oh, we have the mirror thing going on again. Sorry, I can just fix it. Okay, since we have the mirror thing going on, we actually do need this one to be placed in front. Just to make my life easier. It's okay if I do this right. Right, like no one's going to be upset at me. Oh, I didn't mean a new blender window.  This is such an annoying thing about Windows 10 actually. Windows 11. What the fuck? Okay, this is nonsense.  Okay. Makes sense though for the extra bed combiner to look like that. I haven't been using blender, you seem very used to it. This new version, for like 10 days, when was it that I installed Windows 11? All the hardkits are different. If you're not as good as I am right now at blender within two weeks, that is... Um, you need to log in. There's only one side of the world? What? What's the issue with them? I'm the blender expert here and say take your time and have fun. Yeah, that's fair too. My approach to blender was very much not have fun, but rather like... You know, log in, learn the hotkeys and then you get to have fun. Like learn your tools at first and then you get to have fun. That is my approach. How wide are they? 500 coordinates. So let's put them at 12.5 F. Um... Wait. Let's go. Can I use the B perm? How does this work? Action free? So it's not this?  This is what we'll do. Wait, no, they're way faster than that. The hell? Do I want this in 12 frames too? What's 50 divided by 12? Like 48 point... That's... That's... No, that's not it. Uh... 40 point... 16667? That makes no sense. That's not it. That's not even close to it. 20 coordinates. That's 1 point something. 41 point... You know what? We need to move slightly further than that anyway. I can't believe I couldn't do it. What the fuck? It's just 8... 12... That's 6667. 41 point 6667. Should have been easy. Do we have a Mario 64 title from memory? I have no idea. Yeah, being proficient at Blender, like... Tech skill-wise, it is legit just learning a lot of things. Being proficient at Blender, like... Art-wise? Very different beast. For me, the art part is a lot harder than the skill part. But... I suspect I am not unique in that regard. I think these are a little bit dangerous. I'm not allowed at these doors. Yeah, I was working on making it open to the side, but it didn't work. I guess I used the wrong B perm. Now it should work. Why are there 0S blinkering? What? In-game play? What? Yahoo! Oh, you're asking why there's flickering 0S. It makes a lot more sense. It's because of all debug prints that we don't need anymore. Hmm. I'm definitely missing this one here. What? 1086. Did it work? Huh? What? 683. Like, no 10s? I'm pretty certain that nobody got fired for making the 0S blinkering. That's tough. I only learned the shortcuts when I needed them for my specific use. At some point, all the shortcuts mixed in my head and I just kept looking for them. Okay, but what do you do before you use the shortcut? Like, how are you even going to use something if you don't know the shortcut for it? That's the thing. Like, why not just learn the shortcut? 10 buttons everywhere. But that nonsense! What do you mean? You're gonna go to, like... I'm trying to add, like, a plane from here. Oh, actually that works. Okay, now how do I subdivide this plane here? Wait, actually I already hit two shortcuts. Let's try to switch to object mode. Add to edit. Oh, you go to edit mode. And then how do you zoom on it? I'd be lost right now. How do I zoom on it? No idea. Let's pretend we did that. How do we subdivide it here? Oh, actually I guess it's kinda possible. But then, like, while you do that, it already tells... I guess it doesn't tell you the thing anymore. Huh, that sucks. I don't know, Kevin. Oh, right click to zoom. That's fucked up. Yeah, I guess you can use it without shortcuts, but man. No, right click to subdivide.  Okay. Okay, now why was this happening? We are here. Doors open and... Wait, how does that work? Does this B'1 equal 0? Does this B'1 equal 0? What's opening this? Is it the flames? I think the flames are opening them. Action is 1. Okay. That is not free, like I thought. 40 frames seems like a lot. It's just a weird code, I don't like how this is written, but it doesn't really matter. I think if they're showing the N64, I'm hoping they'll give it credit for it, I like text reviews like that. That's good. More is coming. I have another video planned on the missing link, it's just a Zelda game Nintendo took down like right after I made it. I think it's a very good hack. What the fuck. We are just going to hardcode this, fuck it. I don't think there's another way. There's a better way. Also, why didn't the other door move, what the hell. They're both in the same bouche. One, two.  Copyright is gay. Interesting. Where did the hair go? My wife took it off. I said something mean to her and she said fuck you, no more hair for you. Is it even the X axis, what the fuck am I doing, this is clearly the Z axis. The water jug is pretty cool. Dude, my lawnmower is getting repaired today, I'm so excited to meet my lawnmower. You guys know the Gary Come Home song from Spongebob, that's how I feel about my lawnmower. It's a robotic one, and I'm going to put googly eyes on him and he will be my favorite pet. Okay, well one door listened to me. Oh, of course, because only one door is the closer one. Duh. Shit. There is a solution. There is a solution. And this actually improves performance slightly. They might be swapped around, but that doesn't matter for now. We have slightly better culling radius, which is good. 989, 969, whatever. Something like that. The last few streams I've heard 0 mentions of your little child and around 10 mentions of the lawnmower. I don't know man, the child can't mow the lawn yet. Still doesn't work.  Dang. Damn, that's an issue. That is an issue. Input lag on the second door, yeah. Yeah. This theme from 3D.NET goes hard too. It's a banger theme. You want to hear about the actual child? She seems to be doing well too. She's getting into her baa baa baa's. And she likes doing aaaah. Hello, 1359. The code's doing well. This is the level we're working on. Isn't it pretty as hell? And a child joker, true. Okay, they opened way too far. But that worked pretty well. Dang, what a level. I have a banger idea I want to show you. Okay. Talked about this earlier in the stream. So, you know how Mario can walk down slopes? Like, how there are some slopes you can just walk on, like this. Right? And then there's others that are like, slopey. Like this one here. So. Let's say you're Mario. And you're walking to the left, full speed. What is going to happen here in normal Mario 64? Is Mario gonna like, fly off? Or is Mario just gonna walk down the thing? Or is it random? Oh yeah, in vanilla you just kind of float down on them. Shit, I forgot about that. Anyway. The point I was going to make. It's kind of stupid that because of how subframe movement works. Sometimes you're more than 78 coordinates above the slope here when you do that. Oh no, you would stick, I think, depending on the QFs. Exactly, that's my point. But look at this. You consistently stick here. I want to remove quarter frame precision from the player's mind. Like, I don't want the player to think about their quarter frames when they play my game. So, I tried to make collision nearly continuous. I have a whole new collision routine. Look, even this gigafucked geometry like that, you can just walk around in it. Nothing's bad gonna happen to you. You're not gonna get stuck anywhere. It's literally perfect. Look at that, dude. How fucking sick is that? Or when you don't go down the slope like this, you just go the first thing. Crazy? Yeah. But I love it. The average player has never even heard the term quarter frame precision. Exactly. They are just gonna see that and be like, why does it sometimes work and sometimes doesn't? I can't figure it out. And then am I supposed to be there in their Twitch chat going, oh, that's actually because your quarter frame was misaligned? He's a fan, perfect. Ugh, they didn't open wide enough. Which makes sense, because now they would actually need to open 0.5 just above. So let's do that. Would make tuzzing more annoying? But tuzzing should probably not be the primary concern. Or am I just not keen of them? I don't think it would make tuzzing more annoying. Because we have removed the influence of the quarter frame here, right? There actually are no quarter frame steps here anymore. The way this works is you always take a full step, unless there's a ceiling, in which case you take a step that is up to a 64th step accurate. So we're kinda like having 64 steps. Shit, that's off by one frame.  Did I tell them? True. We should just explain quarter steps to the player, so they don't get confused on why things are inconsistent. Well, the egg gate is done. On to the next object. So how does landing work? Can you not get bad quarter frames? I mean, we can check that real quick. Perform step. So this is an aerial step. In perform step, what happens is, first we snap to the move end position here, which means we kinda do a raycast to where Mario wants to go. And if you hit anything on the raycast, we check what it is that you hit. You hit the floor, so it actually snaps to the end of the raycast, which, yes, you can get bad subframe precision in this sense, actually. Now that you mention it, that's kinda stinky. Maybe what I can do is snap this position up, and then do a new raycast to that. I actually think that's what I had before. You know what, I'm gonna make a note for that. Depending on your landing subframe movement, remember where you can make a cut. You know what, just because of the raycast to the end position, instead... What's the best way to handle this? Because the floor is not flat, right? The best way would be you go here, so the collision is here, but the step would have been here. So we snap it up to where the step would be, and then do a raycast this way. But then what if it's sloped? That's still gonna be cut short by a little bit. So depending on how much precision we want exactly, we can add as many raycasts as we want, until we get like 100% of the way there.  Instead, snap the position up to the... Ah, but then also, if we just snap it to the floor, it's not great, because what if it's like really high up? Because at that point you would just be upwarping. Yeah. Oof. I think this might be a little bit of a course problem. Hmm. These steep slopes are gonna destroy us, since the normal vector point is a bit higher than the triangle normal vector's origin. Oh, really? You think I didn't know that? After I programmed it. You think I don't know how my own program works? Just... Hmm. I'll just note this down for now. We don't need to figure it out. Anyway... So this next section we wanted to work on had some issues. Let's take a look at that. Could you not even landing on floors angled down? Nah, that's too jank. I don't like that. We don't want to add exceptions on top of the exceptions. ... Might miss an incident problem, but shouldn't Mario follow the vector speed and stop at the closest of a wall or ceiling? I mean, technically, yes. But think about Mario jumping. Let me show it to you. So... You have a line here. What the fuck? What did I do to paint? Okay, there we go. This is your line. And then your Mario is like... Frame 1... Where's my brush? Maybe... Oh my god, it's so thin. Oh god. New paint is too difficult to use. Oh god. Okay, nevermind, that's actually easy to use. So frame 1 Mario is here, right? And then you jump, and he moves here. Maybe he moves here. Maybe he moves here. Maybe he's right here. And then on the next frame he wants to be here, and that's where he lands. So if you just... Snap him to the last collision... He would be landing like... Here. Which means this whole part of his movement is cut short. Right, that's just gone. Forever. Whereas, had you landed on this frame, then on the next frame he would have moved here. So now... You can't tell whether Mario's gonna be here, or here in the next frame. And this is a vanilla Mario 64 behavior, yes. This is a vanilla Mario 64 behavior. This is why, if you make a tool-assisted speedrun... You have to make sure that you land at the last quarter frame, I think. I'm actually not the expert here, but that's just... That's what would make sense. So, like... So you don't lose three quarters of a frame of movement. And... I would argue, if you have the player thinking about quarters of a frame of movement... In your video game engine, there's a little bit of an issue. That I would like to avoid. ... There is another solution. Wait. ... What if, when Mario lands... We remember what percentage of the frame he moved... And then we try to move him the rest again. Like, we just do two moves, basically. Ah, but now... Then we need to run the whole action handler twice. We need to run Mario on delta time physics. We have to rework everything. ... No, I don't think that makes sense, unfortunately. This is unsolvable without introducing proper delta time physics in Mario 64, I believe. Or by rerunning Mario's behavior multiple times. Both of which would have pretty huge consequences. Wide-ranging across the whole game. That's the kind of stuff you have to build your engine in mind with. ... Oh, what happened here? It's a big boy texture. ... ... At least that's a thing most players don't even notice. True. You think that's video material? Why you sometimes move... ... 45% less than you think you did a Mario 64 dude That would be so you could like send this to all your friends like whenever you die in Mario 64 You could be like actually I died to a to a bad quarter frame landing. I couldn't possibly have done this You What a frame video in general Yeah, I actually had a few people ask me like okay. It's can you break down how Mario 64 collision works? I want to know because I want to implement my own collision engine, and I'm thinking Mario 64 would be a good example Like okay well step one look at what Mario 64 does step two don't do any of it Non object has no attribute matrix local what the hell You That was weird Oh, no, I exported this into the wrong level again. I thought we were finally able to look at this in game and I wish there was a refresh button here, and there isn't so far You There's no way I have all of them I Am okay All right time for poochies area, it's gonna be exciting I Think I'm pretty good isn't it actually works. It's really hard It took me a lot of iteration my own engine Together to a point where it's mostly stable just yesterday. Actually. I was fixing like three different bugs I had a very this is actually what you see in the overworld so When I run into collision bugs, I have to set up like a coordinate perfect thing that I can consistently do So my setup here was like if I hold on to this then press C And then hold on to this and hold full right? Mario would clip through this block That was a really annoying bug You Can also do what the Mario 64 deaths did and like just make a basic engine that only works with limited geometry and then only Make the limited geometry in your game I Forgot to re-export the level Okay, I'm gonna have to turn the game audio off I Mean this is just the same to combine us Okay, he's walking the old path You Do you think I can get TJ Henry Yoshi to comment on my video from you You think it'd be another joke or has he been plagued at this point too much You Okay, that seems to work don't worry about the crash game that's all intended I Think the photos looked great. Let's move on You That guy now, let's do more of the inside of the thing Pucci, let's do Pucci TJ has an entire site Twitter account that it was included of you were making half a press jokes to him. I Believe it Can you tell which ones to do push in which ones the old Pucci Can you tell can you tell The one all the way to the right, yeah, look how optimized by my mate those 59 triangles Wow And you believe this guy You Maybe slightly different Okay, that's gonna be difficult to work this change looks oh, right, let's check if there's anything I'm changing about Pucci Pucci Update design so much newer versions of Pucci colors for the tail on tongue not much to Yoshi's Island render now as an inside mouth texture some shadows on and under the body and The shine on the lips with the reader animations. I didn't test it, but I changed a lot of things Slightly hair on a poorly but lower team. I'm all together a lot less materials. Okay, it sounds good to me  Wait, the weights are still the same. Wait a second. That's it. No way it just works I Don't worry, I'm sure it's not going to work. I'm gonna export and nothing's gonna be fine Well, what the fuck was that Champion video You That's what I thought on seven You It works, holy shit You Is it a junior but also have an element running on the other side of background the content writes a code for the game at Runtime is sure my game will have self-awareness It will produce a personalized version of the experience for you at runtime And Poochie has a few problems, but other than that, he seems fine Typical random mod thing Typical environment color thing You All right, that should do it also put she didn't throw me far enough right there that was weird, right I see flying Mario Should do it You change the height of the platform He looks so cute now Wait Yeah, you can tell he's mirrored look at his feet are they always in sync I Don't think it's supposed to be like that Oh He needs some fake users here Yeah, you can't see his feet on the road you're gonna have to fix that I Think this should maybe stay part of the body You Okay, I'd already is halfway part of the body Interesting odd that it exported at all You had a bang idea you see the bells that you find where you defeat the orchestra man and cuts out the music part By part. Yeah We're doing YouTube out of light to be honest You The algorithm decides what's on the menu today He goes I do they join the overworld and they allow you to play the games music in the jukebox Hmm I mean, I absolutely get the temptation to put a jukebox in and it would be very cool. Yeah That would be pretty cool I Definitely up for something like that now If they think about how the best actually to do it I don't want to put too many hours into that Ooh And which one liked an L and bone I'm assuming it's like one but Alan bone right now. I see Oh Like one and bone again Oh, I literally just removed it, what do you mean? What do you mean There's something about this new Hmm There's something about this new blend I wait anything that I don't get Something makes it really weird I Need other clouds and stuff, but they're already pretty high point. Now. There's you can easily put like 6,000 7,000 police if you want Example how to smooth counterframe function could behave You're in the okay, this is the problem you're in the air right and you land and then you just Projected forward. Okay. So first of all, you're here and you just go upwards you you do like a rake us from above But if it's a steep slope, what if the slope is like this and suddenly you jump up to 500 coordinates? That's problem one Problem two is you're on the ground and you're moving forward on the ground and then there's a wall Now you have both landed and interacted with a wall out of a jump Does this make Mario land or does it make Mario attached to a wall for a wall kick or Maybe you are in an action state where after landing walls act completely different. So now in this action state Well, how would the wall behave in that states right? Maybe like you would be pushing against the wall Maybe I don't know So there's a lot of edge cases here where stuff could go wrong You Get there we have to make some length marker both what does that do? There will not be a lot of trouble when you see that now. Am I blind? Why am I not seeing this vertex below the weight limit? Huh. Wow, I didn't mean to extrude anything. What are those vertexes even? Dude, I don't get it. That's why the up-going vector is very small, Mario can slide on the stuff. So you want Mario to scale his move towards the final goal position by how much further up it is? You would still be moving up then. You'd just gain like air for one frame. I don't think that works. Can I pet that dog? You kinda can. You know what, we're just saying, fuck it, this is gonna be long too. No, I don't want that to be long too. I just do not want that. What the hell? Wait, that's like one R. Oh, it's this one. And I instantly see it, cool. Hey, we got Poochie! Moving up is not a problem if the energy Mario uses to move up is consistent with the remaining energy spent he has for the current frame calculations. Huh? No, he would just stand in mid-air and move forward a little bit. And maybe move up a little bit, but it wouldn't make any sense. He would still be in mid-air, he wouldn't be on the floor. Oh, he's a cutie. Look at him, he's a good boy. What a good boy. What the dog doing? What the dog doing? Thank you for the sub. Never around. No, I'm talking about the steep stop. Okay, I'll show you what I mean. The idea you're posting, imagine we're like so. Wait, no, not like that. Imagine we're like so, and the next frame Mario would be like under this thing here. He would be snapping up, he would hit this surface here, and then you'd be like, okay, Mario should be moving towards this point up here. And then you scale it by the size of the move he was supposed to, and so he's just moving slightly towards this direction. So he's still like in mid-air, and he just kind of randomly get upwards velocity. He will be a fraud. Honestly, this is a really difficult problem, and this is something I feel like you can't really get into unless you've tried it before yourself. Because there's so many weird edge cases that you have to take into account. Oh, really LegeekThePixels, thank you for letting me know this new information. Fuck you. I think I accidentally broke BLJ on surf floors again. But you can still BLJ like this. That's something, right? LegeekThePixels? He could just be like Spanish and really bad at spelling. Not you, I'm talking about LegeekThePixels. I mean, le? That's the French thing, right? That's what they do in the French memes? Le epic meme. I didn't mean to open that. Me when I hit the troll face on the haters. Did you fix the audio static thing yet? I fixed one audio static thing, I didn't fix the in-game audio static thing for this level specifically. My name stands for ThePixelNerd? Yeah, but maybe it's Spanish. I'm gonna put this into translate. Let's see which language this is. Google Übersetzer. Der Pixelfreak. Französisch, no! But what about Spanish? It can translate this from Spanish. What about Italian? Der Pixelfreak. Yeah, it's Der Pixelfreak. It's not calling you a geek, it's calling you a freak. Bro's getting freaky with the pixels. What the hell? Also, what is going on with the black doors? They're not working correctly. What happened here? I don't know. I don't know. He's speaking German is uncanny. Thank you, Würfel21. What is this? Why is it doing that? What the hell?  It freaks me out that you can see German words and just read them like that. Crazy. Crazy what you can do when you are just German. Sometimes you can't even speak the language. How long has this song been playing? 18 minutes? Come on, man. Can we get something else? Why is the YouTube algorithm doing this to me? I should not have added 10 subdivisions to the icosphere. I should not have added 10 subdivisions to the icosphere. I should not have added 10 subdivisions to the icosphere. I regret my choice. Longer version, full extended. Oh, is it not reducing the opacity? I don't know. I mean, genuinely, what the fuck is going on here? I don't know. All the planes moved. My secret action is amateur bones and reactions can make them better animations. It's amateur bones. And they are very expensive in Mario 64. You did a video on Super Mario 64 running on the GBA. So how much better was the DS and how closely did the performance come to the N64? Did it surpass it? To be honest, I have no idea, man. I am not very well versed on architectures other than the N64. But just from looking at them and comparing them, I would think the DS is slightly weaker than the N64. Maybe it's like 80% of the strength. Just from fucking random guessing. I have no idea if that's true. Armour butcher bones are not very expensive. Compared to modern techniques, they are cheap as hell. And on the N64, I actually think armature bones are cheaper than vertex animations. But on Mario 64's implementation, they are kind of expensive because they did it in a stupid way. As you would expect from Mario 64. Wait. Let's move this way around. Let's talk about new consoles as we get an older one. But then it remains like 20th of the size. Yeah, the DS is pretty small. I mean, we can look this up real quick. DS. CPU. Let's just see what they have. Processor. Dual core. I mean, I think an arm CPU is stronger than a web CPU cycle per cycle. The 32 bit doesn't matter at all. And then additional chip, that would do a lot. I don't know what they're stuck for video rendering though. Undefined reference. We didn't even compile the ROM. Undefined reference. That's the wrong level. I'm gonna make my save blocks work again. Somehow I broke the save blocks. And I hate that I can't just save the game. Because I am fucked up control scheme right now. Undefined reference. I did not get a switch to it now. Let me just do that, see what happens. Undefined reference. Oh, wait what? That's just what the model looks like? Huh?  Undefined reference. Well, that won't do it. The problem was that PrimColor was set to on in the model. So when I set PrimColor in codes, it's not actually set in here. That was the issue. Anyway, let's get the spear shot next. Ooh, that's a sexy texture. And only one material for the whole thing, wow. And we don't need primitive alpha even. Undefined reference. Is this the correct size? 125. I think that might be fine, but that feels really big right now. But yeah, I guess we need the visible. Back one... C10 Spirit, okay Meow meow meow! Nye ne ne ne ne ne.. Nye ne ne ne ne... What a f***ing awful song, man, just stop Can't do it, make it stop. Guys I need a different OST You know what, custom Roblox OST 178 Conflicting types for a C10 Spear Include from actors in group 0? Ah f*** That matrix local bug is weird You know what's actually surprising to me? We imported new actors already, but even though we added more models, we did not get a crash from being out of RAM That to me indicates that the collision maps we've made and the models Bionbeck has made reduced RAM usage Which is very good Do you not have RAM reporting? I mean I could just write it within like 5 minutes but no, I don't I only report RAM if I'm out of RAM Because before that, why would I worry? I mean if I was like out and I had to know whether I can fit enough into RAM or not I would probably look into it Speaking of one thing to add, we have 8 megabytes of memory That's like an eighth of the entire game Like we're not gonna run out Oh that looks sick Before my own stream, yeah we did run out and then I just added memory reporting and I fixed it And yes that was literally one kilobyte But since then I just, you know, did a bunch of memory saving optimizations So we should be fine  I think that's all the stuff inside of here Let's get the stuff in the main area Oh that is true, if you want to optimize RAM just use less of it Oh nice there's small little leaflets on this now Oh flower shy guy, oh there's a separate shy guy for flowers Okay we will have to look into that Yes I added that, what? 1159, I thought you did Oh and my column is planned Crown plant I was so shocked by that existing that I forgot about this number 1170 Yeah let me check the row plant first and then we'll do the flower guy Okay Nice big time flux If you're lucky we're adding split-screen multiplayer to this as well That is not Biobak's model I guess I added it to the wrong fucking level again Okay Huh Oh just for this Host is not causing compiler loss Where did it go? Did I even export it? So if we do add multiplayer, oh okay there's a lot more detail If we do add multiplayer the way we would want it to work is There would be two screens on top of each other and a little bit would be cut off on the left and right of the screen which means smaller frame buffers which means more memory actually for that I'm using a custom edit of GCC Whoa I did not like what happened there So Right flower guy time Oh I feel like this is something Zena made initially So The left one is yours Okay he is a little more detailed textualize that's why I'm thinking that one's yours So This feels like a cutout thing and not a transparent thing Like so Or maybe not I see oh the small shadow is nice I find it that you couldn't tell right away what you mean I mean this guy also has some nice details I mean and you said you remove textures come on man Zena's model is not that bad So Even same with the other shy guys yes he reworked all the shy guys That shy guy is crazy now all right I'm looking forward to him It's too bad I feel pressured to only work on this on stream so you can know exactly what I'm doing Because otherwise I probably would have finished this by now So instead of stream I have to work on bug fixes Ah my life off stream is awful right now you guys have no idea man Off stream I'm abused by my wife I'm missing my lawnmower I can only work on bug fixes I'm abused by my wife I'm abused by my wife 214 versus 158 abused what the fuck do you mean It's called a haircut yeah exactly Wait I was... wait let me make up a story um shit am I the asshole no we're not going there because I can't think of anything funny anything funny enough to warrant making a whole video out of this oh there's a bit of a twist going on here so we'll have to do that he's turning into I hate my wife lol boom what okay I don't think boomers say my wife is abusing me and forcing my hair to be cut could be wrong though hello case what are your thoughts on the lattice modifier um I think I've used it before and I think it did some cool stuff but I rarely find a use case for it ah why is the arm so far back whatever that's a problem for the animator um if that's the case I'll leave the kid and leave and take the kid with me the Yoshi's included what what did I do yeah that guys that's how mean she is to me and I bet just for me saying this she's gonna shave off the last bit of hair tonight I'm gonna be completely rid of my hair tonight thanks guys so you said you wanted to see now she's gaslighting me what do you think of Logan's part in blender 4.5 I don't think about it at all that's enough out of you so I forgot the optimal path but you need update animations um maybe he has a completely new rig so the animations look different but they still look fine but the flower guy will probably need new animations so speedruns on this level are gonna go crazy because they just know exactly where to go oh no oh no please tell me I can't go to the flower guy uh-oh the worlds are desyncing you know what I think the flower guy was made but not imported I think that is the issue so I'm gonna add that to my to-do list here no it was definitely in there what maybe he's on oh he's probably on the floor  there he is he's not man friendly oh that's the old one whoops yeah I think we can just trust that works because I don't want to walk there again I've been giving you a seizure true too bad we didn't get to see this part because it looks great oh well there's also temple gates that I haven't imported yet I saw them when I was there just now okay I think I gotta pull up the original here and to see if we can just import this over no changes toxic decal is looking great shit I didn't see it oops I should have looked for it yep okay this should just work you Okay, there are problems with this texture here, let me take a look at this. This is gonna be an IA4 material, this is going to look pretty rough in game and it has to be a decal. We might actually want a primitive color here in the end, but we'll see. Oh, one material, nice, nice. Yeah, I think this would probably work best as an IA4, but I'm not sure. In an IA4 you could make the background entirely black. Let's see, you have semi-transparent pixels here, they are not going to show, but it's all so many pixels that maybe it's fine. It's supposed to be a gate, it keeps people outside by gating them off. Ah, for now we'll just leave it be, I'm sure it's fine, I don't feel like looking at it in game right now. Actually I kinda do want to look at it in game, fine, we'll take a look. Just to make sure. Oh yeah, I saw the apple earlier and I didn't know what the Yoshi sticker on it is supposed to do. What's the point of the Yoshi sticker? Is it supposed to be in game? Is it like a joke thing? I think we're out of RAM again. Oh, shit. Any load roster we have? They already load from memory pool emergency?  Fuck. I thought this was going to be easy memory savings. These also already load from the emergency pool. Uh-oh. Hello, demon. I think this pushed us into out of memory range. Damn, do you know if there's like an asset that saves a lot of memory? That's not so good. Oh, that's... Oh, right, that's the hard project detection. I remember now. Wait, I don't like this ball at all. I don't think this ball is good because there's no shade color here. Why is it like this? Wouldn't it make more sense to do something like texture 0 by prim plus 0 and then combined multiplied by shade? I think for a rotating stone we need shade color because otherwise it's going to look super flat in game. I don't think there's a way around here. Going out of memory exactly, the Nintendo 64 developed by John Nintendo in 1964. I mean, getting back memory should be trivial. It's just an annoying thing if I have to do it right now. The way you had the combiner setup made me think you wanted maybe an additive combiner so we could... Oh god, that looks bad. I'm trying to get it close to what you had initially with shade color enabled. I think this is the best I can do. The basic shade combiner looks alright. Yeah, we just need shade here. I just absolutely need shade here. Because otherwise it's going to spin in game and without any vertex normals it's going to look super flat. We don't want that. Can you put the shader which is always bright on top so when rotating it looks like it's planted from above? That's what I did if you look at this closely. I mean, why are these all memory pool left? I mean... Let me see if this works. Hmm, that just saved a lot of RAM. Huh, I guess I can just do that to save memory. Okay, cool. Cool. Works for me. Yeah, these look nice. I like them. Is the size right? Seems right to me. Is there specific intended uses for the memory pool? The emergency memory pool is a small memory pool. So if you have a lot of small data you can just chuck it in there to prevent any fragmentation of the main pool. That way you can have more data loaded in total, basically. Ew, that's a problem. Yeah, we were all over just a couple of kilobytes. So by just chucking some random other stuff into the emergency pool that doesn't need to be in the left pool, we basically freed up enough memory. It was literally that easy. You know what Mario needs? He needs random and context-sensitive voice clips like Gex. That's what would make the game way better. Let's see if we have any more free submissions while the level is exporting. So far we have three submissions already, nice! I'm trying to think desperately of a celebrity fact to make a quippy one-liner for Mario Art of. But I cannot think of a single celebrity fact. Oops, that's the wrong door. Why did I do that? Note to self, don't mess with the Lord of the Rings manuals, that's true! You know what, just... shit. This part of the level should have the no camera autorotation function applied to it. Because this level definitely, or this area here, should have no camera autorotation. Dude, that's a tweet I made Biobak. Biobak is stealing my one-liners. I said Gex walked a family guy a good run. He's stealing my one-liners. Okay, so there's some minor issues here, I would say. I think that's a fair assessment. You just have the same brain? Mm-hmm. You know what, I actually believe you. I actually believe you that you came up with that independently. Okay. Aha, you made this transparent and not transparent decal. That would do it. That should just instantly fix every issue. And fun fact, if you did this on the Mario 64 engine, it would look like dog shit. Because... Because the layers are in the wrong order on Mario 64. Oh, that's where the doors are. Okay, so the texture doesn't look awful. I don't know why the doors are here. It is what it is. It is weird. How did they screw that up? I don't know, for some reason they just decided to render the transparent decals after. After. There's Mario 64 for you. Lots of questionable decisions. Am I stupid? What am I doing? There we go. Let's see what's the render. 2656. Apparently this is the one for the... That's definitely not it. Right? Maybe that is it. Why are there so many? What the hell? How many of these temple move doors did I put down here? Doesn't make any sense to me. Okay. You have only objects in different blend files. Well, if they weren't the same, Biobak wouldn't be able to work on this at all, considering his spoopy computer. And also, I need to do this for Fast64 to work correctly. Where are all these temple move doors? I don't get it. How many copies are there of Area 6? Why are there 6 copies of the level? Okay. Let's go ahead. Okay. Yeah, I don't know where all these temple move doors are. Bizarre.  Well, to get a bit more space in the emergency memory pool, I should probably reduce my code size a little bit. I guess that's something I can work off upstream. Delete all the Mario 64 assets from the code base. I've been meaning to do that anyway. Gets us a little bit more RAM. And a little bit more ROM, which is nice. Because we're actually also pretty close to the ROM limit. If you look at this, 60 megabytes. Dude, we have 4 more megabytes. Okay, reduce the size. Remove all the stuff that we don't use. We really are approaching the 64 megabytes. Crazy. Crazy. Wait, we already did the Yoshi ball though. Why is it still in here? Mmm, right, I was gonna do the fruit. Now with the fruit... Wait a minute, I need to know what's the point of the Yoshi sticker here. Disappointed? Why is he disappointed? What's wrong with him? Was he sad that the apple did not taste good the first time? Was he disappointed that the apple doesn't look good? Is that it? That's the conclusion I will draw based on the evidence presented. Is there a hard limit here? No, but if you go beyond 64 megabytes you're going beyond what the original Nintendo 64 developers worked with and like that just feels like cheating. You know what I mean? It's a claim. Oh, this one also has the the issue of this is going to be a moving actor. You kind of need the lighting on it. Let's try to recreate this shader without that issue. I'm going to start it on a disk but it's kind of... yeah, I notice. I think I can though.  vertex colors are gone. We don't have packed normals. Now, packed normals wouldn't fix this either, unfortunately.  wait, it looked fine and now it suddenly looks terrible. What happened? It looked fine for one second. Oh, that's why. Honestly, that's pretty sexy. The problem is, how do I get the nth color here without having to do way too much work? The problem is we disabled the nth color in this game because of 64 bugs, basically. A lot worse than you have already been. You have to keep in mind this is going to be spinning, right? If you have a thing like that and there's no lighting on it, it's going to look really bad no matter what you do. I guess I can just show it to you in-game. Wait, why is this stuff different from your model now? Oh, because I have the lighting on. So this is what your model looks like. Let's put it in-game. Too many unique colors to fit CIA8. Damn, I hope this doesn't explode my realm again. Please don't. Could be done like the coins. I have no idea what that means. Hello, Apatilli. Are you casing off to this right here? Yeah, it doesn't look real. I mean, it looks great when it's still, but because the lighting is missing, it's just very visible, I think. So so I think we should try. Looks glowy like it can be. I mean, it definitely looks glowy with the shadows missing at the bottom. It's rough. I should invent something. Okay, wait, so I agree with you that this part is cool and I don't want to use environment color and this has 103 triangles. What if at runtime dynamically I generate a shade value for every vertex and we store this in shade color alpha? Shade only decal, that works too. But shade colors that only update while the thing is rotating work as well, honestly. A lot more work though. Yeah, but when I'm thinking about your shade decal, how would you determine the alpha? I don't think it would work. I think I actually have to compute the shade alpha at runtime. Like so. And then we can just darken it. And we only need this for the apple part too and the only one that's rotating. So it's only, how many is it? It's only 32, 42 vertices. It shouldn't be that bad.  204, okay. So could you tell the game to calculate shade color and put it in shade alpha? No, but that is what I'm going to do. Like I'm just gonna do it. I learned this stuff too, but I got no idea where to even start off. Ah, there's a whole document you can read into. So um That makes sense. Because it's a sphere, the vertex coordinates and the vertex normals are going to be the same direction. Nice. So next thing you're supposed to do is sphere. It's close enough to a sphere. So it's time What's the radius of that? Square root of 144 by 184 plus 15 by 50 191 Okay, so this seems to be approximately a sphere with radius 190 Let's just pretend it's 180 Or sphere radius, it's fine So that means we want to divide the whole factor 7.f by 180.f You know what, I think we'd rather be too big than too small, so let's do that You know what, that's not that much too big, 195 So That's c.cn, what do they call it? v.cn Ah, fuck, we need to rotate the whole thing, I forgot about that, wait, wait a fucking second Why did I not take this into consideration? Of course, the vertices are not gonna pre-rotate it for us Oh no I guess we can rotate the light normal, we have to do that Okay, no big deal, no big deal, we're all fine And we don't actually need to do this Okay Okay, this is what we can do Okay You go here Lights 1 You go to L And then L And then near Is that it? That feels wrong Lights and legs Undeclared, of course That feels wrong There is no way this is right Oh well I'm just gonna append this Now, while the apple is rendering, we should be seeing the light normals printed to the screen if we're pushing the apple only Okay, those are actually reasonable normal, 80, 64, 32, does that fit roughly? Same here With this one, 20 Sun, evening, 2, 0, 4, 0 Perfect, okay, we got the lights normal Now we need to rotate the lights normal by the apple rotation We need to do a mainframe Matrix multiplication for that? I think we do. How do you do that again? I feel like I've done this before. When did I do this before? Wait, before we rotate anything, do the lights look reasonable on the apple? There's definitely lights on it, but I wouldn't say that they look reasonable. Why do they look so unreasonable? I don't know. Yeah, a few of these places just look way too dark. Oh, wait a second. It should be max 0.5 and not that. That should help a lot. It's better, but not good. There's still some places that are just black. Yeah, something about this is still nonsense. Making it brighter would be trivial, obviously. The question is why is it even possible for it to go fully black? I don't see how that should be possible right now. What if I take out this whole thing here? It should just be like a dark apple now, but not black, just like slightly dark. Yeah, okay, it does that. Unless there's pieces of the smash that don't confirm to the radius that we've determined this to have. Let's see. What is it? I guess 16 multiplied by 16 minus 0.5 by 85 minus 1.9 by 1.9. But it's the same radius. 170 and 180. What's the radius about? Also about the same. I think that doesn't make any sense. How can the max return a number below 0? Unless I fucked up my compile somehow. That one vertex here looks definitely black. I don't see how black is possible. Unless I did something wrong in the loop itself. Is CN3 false? This is not what we needed. 1 is divided by 0, so 0. That's the size of one vertex. Is it maybe inverted? That looks extremely wrong to me. Some of these vertices at the bottom are mostly bright and others are not. What if we normalize the vertex vector beforehand, just to verify We don't have this function here. We do. Yeah, I don't see how the black can appear there either. We have 190 baselight already. Yeah, it's still appearing black. It doesn't make any sense. How can the baselight be brighter that way than if we add something? Unless it overflows, which I don't think it should be able to. Yeah, look at how nice and bright this is now. Oh wait, I forgot! The light's I guess it was overflowing the fuck out of it. Okay, the problem is I have to re-implement it in software as well, so I'm gonna re-implement it. Okay, that looks a lot more reasonable now. Now, let's add how much of the light comes from the network. What does that mean? The N64 doesn't have a network. Okay, and I think they are still inverted, but look how smooth and nice they are now. There we have smooth lighting, despite having vertex colors. Isn't that beautiful? Now we just need to rotate the light normals by the object matrix, which we can do by generating a rotation matrix and then multiplying our vector with it. The range of light's perspective colors? Possibly, but this is a bit more complex than that. It's not just that, it's also like the I'm like 100% sure I've implemented this before. I'm just gonna figure out why I did that right here. In the Wiggler car, I remember. Oh, and then after I implemented it, I realized I didn't actually need to implement it, and I also only computed the up vector. You know what? We're doing this a little bit easier. I don't know how speedy WASM would be with PS2, I have no idea what that means. Don't you need the inverse matrix? Wait. Um, no. Actually, I don't. I have to implement this myself. I don't know why I did that. If I actually do need the inverse matrix, I will be sad, but I don't see why I would need that. I don't know why I did that. I don't know why I did that. That should do it, right? Guys, can someone tell me if my math is right? Or am I on my own here? Why is it not working? We're still transferring the light vector from world to object space, which is the inverse of the usual object to world transform. So multiplying it by the object matrix would do that, I think. Yo, why the fuck is my component- oh, I guess I'm missing one semicolon. And then... So then you define this- whoops. One more back. Huh? You think my compiler is not working because I have to mull back? Yeah, I need to make the lights more extreme so I can actually properly see what's going on. Oh, the mullback is a hardware bug on the Nintendo 64. That makes it so that two multipliers in a row kind of mess up. This feels very wrong. Why is it always on the side? It was just a stupid mistake, and... Maybe we do need the inverse transformation. But wait, this feels like the light's not rotating at all. Why is the light not moving at all? That shouldn't be going on. Should it? That doesn't make any sense to me. Let's try that again with some printing. All this just to get some shadows on the stupid apple. Yeah, it's not rotating any lights here. What the hell? What went wrong? Oh, that's why. This is because we're not running this from current objects, but rather from the graph, right? So we should use the graph thread values as well. This will make an update at 60 FPS, which is a little advantageous compared to not doing that. This also means if we are ever lagging below 30 FPS, it will update below 30 FPS. Case why. Because Biobak wants his vertex colors on the apple, and I want my shadows on the apple. So we compromise by computing the fucking shadows on the CPU in real time. Fuck. How do I invert the matrix? It's my favorite kind of compromise because you do all the work, pig. I mean, at least it's, you know, it's not always on top. It looks kind of fucking cool though, doesn't it? Yes, the shadow rotates very weirdly. Shouldn't be like this at all. Also, this is an issue that I don't like. This is because it's like a thin fence, and I think my engine does not handle those. So just swap the indices in the matrix. Wait, what? Really? That's all I have to do? If it is that easy, then I will be happy. Okay. That would be goated. But why doesn't the object use textures instead of vertex colors? Because Biobak wants his 32x128 texture on it. We did it! We did it, chat! Oh yeah, Biobak, did you see I ruined your slide? Because if I didn't ruin it, the apple would always fly off. What the hell? Okay, we have one more thing to fix. Get quarter- No! The collision is just inverted. There is no quarter steps. This stupid apple was so much done work, dude. Oh my god. Leela, did you see my anti-quarter-step tech? Are you talking to Leela? Wait, yes, she did see that, I think. I don't know if she understood the significance of it though, how cool it is. What did I say? Did I not say Leela? Did I say a weird name? I did not show it in the video. I literally made it yesterday. She was here! I'm not crazy. She was like, Kayce, you're so stupid, why are you doing this? Look at this perfect apple. Can you make the light come from the top, FL? The light is programmed to dynamically pull the light in the real level. So because right now in the real level the light is coming from there, it is also coming from there on the apple. So what you should be asking is, can you make the light on the level come from the top, which I can. Do you want that? You think the level would look better if the light was coming from the top? I can easily do that. I don't know if you answered, because I switched the way I read it, but heavy for you I guess. Aha, thank you. Not sure what it would affect, since most of it is vertex colors. Well, it would affect all the actors. But now the light is from straight on top, in the whole level. You can see it immediately on Mario. I was really struggling with those fences. That's so cool, there's just a door with a Yoshi on it and it opens up and there's a fucking Yoshi in it. I mean, you would expect that, right? But that's cool. Imagine your room had a door with just your picture on it. Alright, it is 5.10, we have been streaming for over 3 hours. I'm gonna go back to my real life now. So I will see you guys in the next stream. Probably on Monday, because I am now on vacation. But I can't stream tomorrow, because we're doing some other stuff. But until then...
