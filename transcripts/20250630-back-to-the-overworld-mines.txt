Sorry, I'm still half-eating. Ah, hello, Boa Voia. I will start a fight. I will drink water in a second. I will start a fight. No, no, no, no, no. All right, the level is loading, and then we will be back to programming the overworld. This will be fun. Hello, the geek that speaks cells. The geek that speaks cells. We're going to program a cannon opening cutscene too. In the few hours that I've been off-stream, I fixed some bugs, and I implemented a really cool new optimization. Which is 4x3 matrices. Which I should make a video about at some point. Hello, tea time. I don't hear the game. Now I do. So you cannot buy from him, this all works. Is the rework done? Yep, that's all done. There's some minor bug fixes left, but I need animations from Xenna first, and then we will ship it off for beta testing. Still waiting on the course 7 beta testing results, the guide I would like to test out is pretty slow, unfortunately. I want a shadow overworld. I just don't like the same color. I also don't like that the save block looks like a star from far away. That's a bit stupid. Yes, the overworld has like 15 different themes. Badoop made another one this morning. Hello, calcite lion. This is for the castle part, in front of Bozo's theme park. The closed cannon door. How is it even going to open? If it goes to the side, it's going to go into the mountain. Or into the thing. That wouldn't look good. What if we made it multiple parts that kind of like retract into each direction? Or like a door that opens like this? Hmm. What if it was two flaps? Like that. I think that might look better. Hmm. Or we could make them all fours, and they kind of rotate to move away. I think that would look cool. Any OST wishes for today? The music you heard just now is planned to be used in the overworld. Is there one from the first demo again I think you don't really need? No. Okay. And listen to DKC2. Hello, LumaLess. Hello, Paneros. Hmm. Maybe something like this is a good one. Yeah, in Donkey Kong 64. Uh... I haven't beaten it. I... If I remember correctly, I played it. I was in my 20s when I played it the first time. And I got to the Jack in the Box fight. And half the boss fight is just you waiting somewhere to be able to hit them. And that was so goddamn annoying that I'm just like, I can't play this game anymore. Hmm. I learned it at... That's... It was like that and they all went in. I think that could look decent. But also... Hmm. It's not quite what I was thinking. Could be in the corners, but eh. All of that looks kind of bad. That'd be pretty. Any? Oh wait, we can just move it into the mountain here. Oh, easy. Okay, we'll do that. I would like there to be a Bob-omb on this. Actually. Dang, this video shows up. Is this a popular video? 20,000 views, holy shit. I want to make a main channel video about that. I think that could do really well. Ah, so this is what they looked like in Mario 64. So I want something like this. But with the black ones and without the poopy look. Okay. Today feels like such a slow-paced stream. I don't know why. He just looks so bad. He'll still be visible when you don't scale him. Can I ask you something? That is a paradox. In a way. In the same way that Mario 64 is a parody, in the same way that when you say it is raining, I don't believe it is raining, asking can I ask you something is paradoxical or seemingly paradoxical. I think this one could work. Yeah, let's try to make this work. Can I ask you about asking a question? It's the same paradox. What are we doing, guys? So rotate hotkey. Turn off thesis, rotate. Street car. I don't know why I'm asking this, but I very want to make something cool. I'm not asking you to make it with me. I just want to know how to do this. It's easy. Might take a little bit of time. But I have legitimately known people with mental disabilities that I've made rom-mics before. I don't know why I'm asking this, but I very want to make something cool. I don't know why I'm asking this, but I very want to make something cool. I don't know why I'm asking this, but I very want to make something cool. How do you unfloat a layer? I guess. I guess. I'm slowly getting better at using game. I'm slowly getting better at using game. Now how do I unfloat that? Now how do I unfloat that? There we go. When I see a rom-mic, I expect the author is on the spectrum. It might be, but I'm talking about actual mental disability. I wouldn't call someone on the spectrum being in any way disabled. being in any way disabled. being in any way disabled. I'm just saying, you don't need to be incredibly smart to make a rom-mic. Anyone can do it. Anyone can do it. How do I set this to grayscale? How do I set this to grayscale? I don't like how it looks when it's grayscale. How do I make the feet very dark when it's grayscale? Maybe it's better I don't. Maybe it's best I just make this a 32x64, Maybe it's best I just make this a 32x64, make the background a bit darker. I'm wondering, I'm wondering, what's the sum total improvement of all the optimizations against vanilla? depending on the use case, depending on the use case, in the absolute worst case, it's a 5x speed improvement, and in the best case, it's a 10x speed improvement. How do I apply a filter to... How do I apply a filter to... I guess I can... How do I merge two layers? How do I merge two layers? What I want, I just want to merge these two. Okay, that was not the button. Nope. What's the difference between flattened image and merged visible layers? I don't see a difference. Merge down. Aye. Why is the contrast slider so crazy? Why is the contrast slider so crazy? Why is the contrast slider so crazy? Makes no sense. Sync sims against vanilla? Sync sims against vanilla? All not of the time, yes. All not of the time, yes. Why not give a scrap paint effect? Why not give a scrap paint effect? I don't know what that is. Never thought about it. Anyway... How do you... How do you scale the image in GIMP? How do you scale the image in GIMP? That will work. Whatever. I'm sure Biobank will look at this and be like, this sucks, I'm making a different one. And that would be fine. And that would be fine. I'm just going to have it like this. I'm just going to have it like this. We're just going to program the cutscene for this. We're just going to program the cutscene for this. Right now, everything else doesn't matter. Right now, everything else doesn't matter. So the optimization I did off-stream was to turn the 4x4 float matrices into 4x3 float matrices. This works well because the last column is always 0, 0, 0, 1 in random matrices because they're fine matrices. That works well because the last column is always 0, 0, 1 in random matrices. That works well because the last column is always 0, 0, 1 in random matrices. So now we can get rid of this and replace everything with the last column, which is 0, 0, 1. So now we can get rid of this and replace everything with the last column, which is 0, 0, 1. So now we can get rid of this and replace everything with the last column, which is 0, 0, 1. So now we can get rid of this and replace everything with the last column, which is 0, 0, 1. So now we can get rid of this and replace everything with the last column, which is 0, 0, 1. So now we can get rid of this and replace everything with the last column, which is 0, 0, 1. the last column. Here it is. I'm programing a cutscene I'm programming a cutscene I'll show you in one second, okay? I'll show you in one second, okay? I'm genuinely almost done. We should have a little bit of a We should have a little bit of a sound effect here and some shaking. sound effect here and some shaking. sound effect here and some shaking. What's the open cannon sound effect? What's the open cannon sound effect? Probably this one, right? Let's see how this works out. Oops. I finally did 4x3 matrices. I finally did 4x3 matrices. I implemented them yesterday. It was actually pretty easy to do. I expect that to be like a 100 microsecond improvement, which is really nice at this stage. which is really nice at this stage. Basically all the engine features are done now. He said he wanted to maybe rewrite the sound engine too. Which would be sick, on top of my rewrites. Oops, I forgot to make that solid. Oops, I forgot to make that solid. Okay, that was decent. To do what? He wanted it to be a little more compressed. I have some pretty cool ideas on how to use bitflags in the comments use bitflags in the comments to do certain things. That would be sick. You were just watching Squid Game Season 3. Dude, I finished it like 15 minutes before the stream started. I have been saying Squid Game is incredibly silly since Season 1. I thought the whole thing is stupid. Season 2 and 3 Season 2 and 3 Season 2 got a lot more stupid. Season 3 got a little less stupid than Season 2 in my memory. Season 3 got a little less stupid than Season 2 in my memory. It kind of delivered on what I expected. I'm watching it the way that people watch The Room, I think. I'm watching it the way that people watch The Room, I think. I'm fully happy with how Squid Game turned out this season. Not a hater at all. It delivered what I wanted. ? ? ? I was saying earlier that people didn't like it. I don't see the issue. ? ? ? ? ? I don't get it. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Okay, done turning, this is a fucking weird code, what the fuck, make this slightly more reasonable. I thought it was a Squarepants AI cover, it's kinda like that. So is it said Mario NPC dialogue that's not working? Nope, this should be fine. Did I break something here? Is this actually ending the dialogue? Okay, we can actually listen to real music now, you guys got any wishes? That's a burning throat, true. Maybe this will tell us something, whether we hit this breakpoint or not, when you were coding Ganon or Door. When I was coding the Bomb Bomb I definitely changed a lot about how dialogues work, so that's probably when this broke. TTYD LST, fine. I fucked up, why did I do that? The whole vanilla dialogue system I'm not a fan of, that's why over time I just removed more and more parts of it and made my own. It doesn't advance to the end action dialogue ever. What if I just do that? Oh, I was listening to the remake, I didn't even know. As far as new moves work, they all work out of pressing Z, so like ground pound and then you press B for example, or you ground pound and then you press A. That didn't do it either. Did we just never even get here? That shouldn't be right. Mario's head does bug out when you land like that, that's why velocity doesn't reset. I guess I could fix that right now. Fuck it, why not. There, it's fixed. My compiler to assembly is GCC. I'm ginch dem ganz überall or something from Matrix. What? What are you saying? So, okay, this shows up. Why don't we just print the dialogue state, that might be easier. Yep, check cards. I cannot give you a release date. The game is not finished yet, but all the main content is kind of there. We still need to program a couple things. Right now we're kind of like in the polishing phase, I would say. Dialogue state is 2. What the hell? So dialogue state, await dialogue. So after this, it never advances. Dialogue response becomes 1. They are in a separate dialogue file. So we're stuck in await dialogue forever, even though once this is done, the dialogue state advances. Which means this always returns 0. Oops. Well, let's see which of these two we hit when we're in here. Maybe I should just pull out Nemru. It just stops calling this function. Wait. The action advances as intended. It just never finishes this. Because we are getting a dialogue response before this happens. I see, I see. I think this will fix the issue. That makes sense if I changed that recently. There we go. I'm not using LibDragon. I'm using a modified LibUltra, and currently DeathWizard is working on a completely new LibUltra, and I'm going to be using that. And then modify it. LibDragon has a very different design philosophy from our program. Well, maybe not very different, but they prioritize some different things, and I don't want that. Smartest returns usually silent. I just need to get three stars real quick, so I can test if Poochie still shows up. Where's good coding practices? Good coding practices are nonsense. Half of good coding practices is just inefficient garbage. I think I have decent coding practices in RTYI, for the most part. When I care. Lilay, have you heard my recent idea that I had today? Why don't we force compilers to store variables in knobs? Think about it, there's so many knobs in the game, and each one of them is like 2 bytes or even 3 bytes of useless data. We could force the compiler to store data in there. I've definitely done it before in Assembly. Oh, he's shitting donuts, that's what's going on. It wouldn't mess up Emulatorist. I know, because I've done this before. But think about it, if you have a knob, what you can do instead is add you R0 and then whatever else you want. You can add anything you want into R0, nothing's gonna happen. So that gives you a couple bits to just fuck around with. Oh no! Oh, it didn't squish me. It was supposed to squish me. This is a bug I would say. Was Malus put in Rty or v3313? I think I can make v3313 in 2 months tops. I still need to get that star somehow, but it might have saved. It did save, cool. Yes, that already exists in Rty. I guess I made v3313. Oh, Pochi isn't here. Oh wait, I'm on the wrong star, duh. Bro is 2 hours behind, he is watching on YouTube. Dude, I just realized, YouTube chat is like those Internet Explorer memes. Words like, hi guys, happy 2020. Oh yeah, you can easily do that. I mean, it's not gonna be v3313 though. Let me actually take a look at this to see if I can see anything. Oh, gameplay, cool. Yeah, no UV mapping, just fucking not even unwrapping it. Fucking Google SketchUp ass garbage. Everything on the fucking black outline, just throw shit in. Yeah, I can make a level like this in 2 hours tops. That's like what, 5 levels a day? 4 levels a day? And then over a month, that's 120 levels. How many stars are in a level here? Like maybe 3 or 4? So in 2 months is realistic. So I was exactly right on everything, holy shit. Yeah, I did help them out with a couple things. I didn't make it. There shouldn't be anything wrong with the model in Project 64. But I don't know that 100%. But to my knowledge, there's nothing wrong with it. There are some old versions that are not safe though, but I think modern is fine. So this is what we're gonna do. Which is gonna be in the overworld, only if you have done it first. And I think that's gonna be cool, to be like oh shit, the little dog followed me out of the level. I know that this is all inefficient storage-wise, but... I think I've changed his name. A doghouse is possible. Yeah, you said that raw mechanism is a model that already exists, but the phantom, I don't know. I just know it already exists. I don't know. It's dirty, but it'll work. I'm gonna go get some water. I'll be right back. Okay. Favorite early 2000s tropical game, this. Quite limited. How many early 2000s tropical games are there? Okay. Sonic Adventure? Oh, just one area counts? I guess the beach kinda has it, yeah. Sunshine. Yeah, that's the only one I can think of. That I would consider tropical. Okay. Okay. I need to think of Mario standing on top. I think animation too. Shit, where is the animation keyframe editor? Ah, shit. Where do you set the amount of animation frames in the noob lander? I can no longer find it. Black City doesn't feel very tropical to me. I have to go to timeline. There we go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Wait, we can do this easier by just reusing an action stance. We do this. That's perfect. And then we take... 0103. How do I do this again? I hate this function name, but we name it this. Okay. Let's give him a random chance to spawn coins like every tick. I think that would be cool. Let's see. You make a Smash Bros. character? That could be fun. I would make the strongest Smash Bros. character and then no one could beat me. I had this idea to make this Mr. Beast style video where it's like I hacked every Nintendo 64 game in one day. And it would all just be like shitposts like that where I make my Smash character invincible or I cheat at Mario Party. All right, if everything works, he should be walking up to me somehow, at least a little bit. Ooh, that's not working at all. And he's not solid. Hmm. Cool, cool, cool. Nothing was working whatsoever. Ah, he's still not solid. Did I open the room too fast after compiling? I was so sure he would just be solid now. He has no interaction either. Huh. Well, I guess he's not really supposed to have interaction, so that's fine. Still, um, weird. Unless this condition is empty somehow. Nope, that looks good to me. Okay, this music's driving me insane. I'm skipping ahead. Um, there doesn't seem to be anything moving him actually. Now that I look at this. It's probably because part of his behavior is at the end here and I didn't copy it over. Yeah, that would do things. Okay, he's moving. He's still not solid. I actually have no explanation for that. I'm guessing these animations were not meant to loop. Hmm. Okay, that looks a little better. Poochie is here. I found Poochie. What the fuck? What have I done to Poochie? Why is he like this? When did that happen? Open the file. And that's so slow right now. It is probably centered here, it's not probably centered here. I am not sure why. I don't think I did that and if I did that, that was a huge accident. No! Fast64 did that! As soon as I had export, Fast64 does that. That is a Fast64 bug. Huh. What the hell? Hello Biobank. Oh, we made a lot of progress today. We programmed a cool cutscene for the cannon. Opening, when you buy the opening for the cannon. Over there. Maybe I can show you. Okay, I broke it again. Don't worry about it. I already know the issue I think. And then we were working on Poochie. Congrats, you made a progress. Leave me alone. Let's just try this. And then we're also working on Poochie. We want Poochie to, um... Follow you around. Hey, remember the ability to change direction with a ground-bound dive? I like that. Yeah, you can kind of change the direction, but not fully. There's like a limitation to it. It's been like that for a long time, at least half a year. Oh, because I'm using all opacity, of course. Yeah, exactly, that is the limitation, the fact that you lose your speed. Right, so if you go backwards, you lose all your speed, and if you go forwards, you keep all your speed, but if you go perpendicular, you actually also keep your speed. Yeah, we put Poochie in the overworld, he kind of follows Mario around. And if you jump on him, he goes to a random spot and starts digging. He starts digging. He starts digging. Hey, he dug. Just took way too fucking long. Does he get a star? No, just coins. This ain't your average Mario Odyssey. You think that needs a star? I don't know, it's like such a cheap star. I kind of don't want this to be a star. Unless you're thinking completely different star. Here I'm going to let him dig until he finds a star. He only digs once. After the first dig, he just stops. At least he's not supposed to dig again. Yep, after that he's done. Didn't expect to stuff him this. He could dig up something that leads to one of the minigame entrances, if we want that. Or one of the side level entrances. Like maybe he has a random chance to do that. If he did that right away, I think that would maybe be a bit much. Or maybe we can let him do that right away. Yeah, I think that would be fine. Let's note that down then. Kudu. Kochi digging leads to give you something of importance as well. How about this being a minigame? Or side level entrance somehow. And then side level entrance appears. Kochi. Can etch the player again. Like a treasure map or something like that. Or what are you thinking? Because I'm fine with that. I'm just saying this is something he could give you. Oh god, that sounds so annoying to do biomech. Gameplay-wise, that sounds like it sucks to live with. You can dig with him every time you come back to the overworld. Next we need the rope. And we need to think about how to make an animation for the rope. I don't know what it's gonna do. It's wrong. Simulate and bake it? How? Like with bones? With bones it could work. That's fast64, the geek in the pixel. The parallax animation is way too expensive. It has to be bones somehow. How do we simulate something like that? Do we just make one long rope and then put an animation of it just being flung together and then you kick it once and it just unfurls like that? Maybe there's like a wooden pike here that it's wrapped around. Oh, but kicking it like that would feel very unintuitive, right? That wouldn't feel right. How is the idea for this again? It needs to be extremely visible. Explore the deep bush like a grindle and then unrolls the rope. Not sure I fully understand. I was thinking of it just being curled up like a snake around a pillar. Or not even that, just like rope being here. Maybe tie it around the thing once. Way too complicated. There needs to be something that's basically unmissable. Something where no player in their right mind would skip this, because skipping this on accident would be extremely frustrating. I recall it also just being a snake. Imagine there's just a snake standing there trying to attack you and you kick it in the face and it turns into a rope. Tap to unwind, like a fucking mobile game. That's important. Imagine there's a flute snake and it goes straight and allows you to climb. True. I'm just gonna have friendly NPCs everywhere. That misses the desolate feeling of Yoshi's Island at the beginning. We want this island to feel very dead at first and then you free the Yoshis and suddenly there's life everywhere. I mean it being on the spool kind of works, yeah. But no, you don't have to bring anything. You get here and you can open it. You experienced brain fog? Those look so clear and sharp when you're working on your project. No, I don't. No, guys, you cannot get up here. Except by walking all the way along the island and then opening it yourself. That's the whole point. It's like a shortcut you open up by making more progress in the game. I'm just thinking for a good way for the rope to unfurl. It could also just be anchored on the floor, like I'm fine with that. But how do I make the rope look nice and kickable is the question. The rope could be a Rondolitos, I don't care about that. There could also be a pillar you can pound into the floor to unfurl the rope. No, you can't get out of bounds. At least not to my knowledge. The thing is, Mario cannot exist if there's no surface somewhere. Looks like we'll just stop moving. I'm a bit worried that players are going to come out of this cave here and not see this. But okay, that is so hidden that players will probably see this first. Okay, perfect. So we want the entrance to the lighthouse to be around here. That's an interesting bug and a pretty bad bug. Let me just mark this here. Come to think of it, I didn't make the section inside the lighthouse yet. Oops. Okay. Oh. I see. Wouldn't it be easier to just push this spindle thing, this part here? What if we put a pole here and then a spool here? And you just push the spool and the spool fell down. Oh, there's some fun multiplayer ones. We played Driving Strikers GTM, I played it with Zena, it was fun. Yeah, yeah, I'm just thinking of a different anchor, I guess. In your drawing, it kind of looked like Mario's pulling on the anchor. Okay. I forgot how you place the cursor again, oops. Find that one. Um, I'm sure Spooky Ilua has it online somewhere. Oh yeah, this is why I switched to Eevee again. Because I can't even see my thing. I can't see my texture, how am I gonna work? I was coding earlier in the stream. Oh my god, how expensive do you guys think it is to pay for Driveway? Oh my god. Okay. Get something like this for here, and then... That should kind of work. So I'm gonna wrap the rope around here, put a spool here, Mario pushes the spool, and that gives you this thing. Should look good, let me think about how to best animate this. So actually, we can do a vertex animation here. Since the rope is just getting longer, I can simply scale the UVs of the rope texture and the vertices on the spool with the position of the spool. Interesting. Interesting copy printing. The guy wanted 7000 plus HST, so like 8000 to do on Driveway. Expensive as fuck. What's the problem? There's no problem, I'm just thinking about how to do this. I got the spool on here, do this. Then the corner, how do I do the corner? I think I could hide a bone inside the spool. You push it, you push it, then as soon as it's over the corner, the bone just stays here with one part attached here and one part attached here. And then the spool just stays at the bottom here. That should work. We could scale the rope a little bit, but it also has to rotate. I guess we have to un-rotate the bone, which is fine with an attached bone. So we have spool, bone in the middle of the spool, with the bone attached. The bone in the middle rotates with the bone, which will work. It's at the bottom first, you spin it 180 degrees, it's at the top. Then the spool starts falling down, the bone has to stay in place and be attached to the other thing. So we just have to scale the UVs there too. Multidirectional rope material with an I8 gradient, so the alpha slowly appears. And then we have to un-rotate the spool. Yeah, that is a much easier idea. So we just model the whole rope and then un-rotate the spool. That's an easy idea. What if I make it so that additionally, in addition to your idea, there is one bone on the spool with the rope and the bone shrinks over time. So it looks like the spool is losing rope. I think that's a cool idea. The only thing you will need to make look good is to make the rope shake around when the spool comes off at the end. The rope shake around... As in left and right? We can definitely do that. Let's animate the rope a bit to make it look like it's being tucked on. The spool has a separate bone for the rope that shrinks over time. Yeah, we'll do that. And we'll flow, it will look very good. We go straight as long as the weight is at the end and it reaches the end of the rope. is around. Well, the spool will just end here, right? And stay here. So yeah, there should be a bit of a tug here. And then we can make it light at the end. Yeah. Let the rope be loose at the very edge. Let me think about this. Oh, that will look weird if I just do that. I have to make the spool go all the way to the bottom and then it like slightly bounces and then the rope becomes loose. Okay, if you're gonna do stuff for the reworkers anyway, then maybe I should just make it stiff for now, just to make my life easier. Anyway, I think I'm done with stream for today. So I will see you guys in the next stream, which there is a good chance it'll be tomorrow because I'm still on vacation for another week. Make the spool come off and roll off camera at the end. Yeah, that works too. Actually, yeah, that's easier. Fuck it. Spool gets naked at the end and just rolls off camera. Rope is loose at the end of the spool on the floor. I think that will look good. All right, next stream. Bye bye!
