I'll be life now. I hope it all worked I think we're life. Can y'all see me? Yeah, you're like Hello external might and a creep attacks Looks like making a broadcast was really worth it and reminded a lot of people This is where we were last time well, I made a bit of progress I've been working on my sine cosine video for a while. So I haven't made too much progress on this. I Haven't had a new microphone in like three or four years Take your shirt off. I'm in a bad mood because my bike was stolen And me taking off my shirt would lift your mood, huh How much of this course is done I'm not sure we're still modeling it it really just depends kind of on what we end up doing I mean most of the main areas done modeling now. We're almost ready to stop programming it Hello Petra. Oh Yeah, we changed the camera since last time to The camera slightly different Lilaa was complaining about it and I kind of saw her point Does the camera work better now You So this is gonna be the electricity generator thing that can go down in and I Think it's mostly done modeling. I Who doesn't like complaining We love the biggest complainer The dim movement and this feels so good You Oh you are in it, okay. I mean that's good being able to nitpick is important Just have a generic real world or a rigorous modeler starting platform for the level No Yeah, this from will be staying in the 64 megabyte limitations right now I can actually show you I'm working on the game editing content as I'm going. We're in course 11 and we are 42.8 megabytes in size. So I Know You So, yes, what You Come on OBS Can't even hear the maximum. Yeah. Yeah, look what's happening It fucking crashed Hey, there we go now you have audio Is It back Hello game a man Either way, so we were working on our level The first is troll the balsa troops, which is gonna be here. We have a bunch of stuff that we have to do as well Second we have the minions are striking which is gonna be here You're gonna be eaten by a block and you're gonna be sent to a separate area with the cleaning crew Third mission buzzes doesn't actually know that's the boss enemy, right? The second one is where you will go up here and knock off both us hats Thought it's gonna get eaten for this platform from an unfinished power generator, which is this one here the power generator I Mean working, but the music's too quiet to hear it looks pretty loud to me. I think that's you But kind of some DKS construction beams, okay So the construction beams are gonna be in this area behind the balsa statue That will be our next task to make the construction beams which you know, I'm kind of not that much of a fan of it because that feels like such a secluded area, you know If we're gonna make it a secluded area like Gameplay wise and might as well be like an actual different area visually as well The balls ahead thing will be very very cool What if we just made this like go all the way around buzzer From here to here and then you could actually just like a platform in a circle on this level if you wanted to I Think that would add a lot And then you can go underground here Here and here and you can go underground here and there will be an underground section where you can get the 8-bit pipe and There will be a section in the power generator The thing I'm not sure about yet is how the underground section is gonna be I have no idea what that is. Def PC never played f0 The two OBS on a taskbar that is a lie You Yeah, so what I'm not sure about yet is how exactly we're gonna do the red coin stuff because I feel like we don't have Enough platforming mechanics. We might want to brainstorm and other type of platforming mechanic here Maybe like an oil spot or something, but should you be able to stand on an oil spot? Maybe there's something cool on oil ocean we can use I was going to be fun to do it. The platforming in here is insane. Actually It feels so good to move around and to You Floating fence. I kind of like the idea of just fence going fence and turbines I have a couple wind turbines. Yeah sitting there. I'm thinking of turbines that just shoot you horizontally or vertically What do you think of wind turbines Like not like this but somewhat like this I guess Are there any an oil ocean actually? It all of Sonic mania made me rage because everything is just like Oh Random thing came on screen that you couldn't possibly have reacted to now you take damage But after yeah, yeah a plane engine that's what I was looking for Like this That is a good inspiration yes, yes, I thought they had something like this an oil ocean as well Sonic a steampunk version of it to the cats. I Figured it would be old and chrome a copper No, well I do want something like this Is that just sucking at baby games No, literally Sonic will make you make jumps that require 90 millisecond reaction time Which is outside of the possibility of human reaction time You have to go slow if you want to play Sonic without getting hit and that's literally just fucking boring Who would want that Is since the vertical ones are going to be placed directly on the level we might as well be some big metrics colors Mania it's just Sonic 1 2 3 and see and that was probably graphics and what to new stages Huh, I thought it was better than a lot of the classic games but like it was made in such a different time where like That style of game design was just not viable anymore that I think it's kind of like a really bad game Kind of made sense for the first few Sonic games to be like that because back then Games were like what nowadays is like $300 Right, and you would just have one game and play it forever So it made sense to expect the player to replay the stages But Sonic mania was made in a time where you only play every level once Right, so there was no memorizing the level like that was in the old Sonic games So using the same style of gameplay that we're used to in the classic Sonic games relies on the player having the level memorized It's just bad That's my Sonic mania hot pack What are Sonic superstars It's a new Sonic game that came out recently Well, I'm definitely not gonna buy it because I never buy anything. I hate buying stuff. I like having money I really don't have these problems playing Sonic. No, it's actually impossible. Have you looked at Sonic gameplay? Let's see Let me actually prove it to you real quick Let me just wait until this guy goes into something Does he ever go fast though He's going slow as fuck Slow as fuck go fast Okay, let's see. He's going for there. Okay, you see the spikes the spikes are not even on screen right now, and he's going and There's no way for him to react to this And he got hit by it. It was completely impossible for him to react to this There's nothing he could possibly have done to avoid taking this damage here and I didn't even look very long at the video. It literally took me five seconds to find this clip That's why Sonic mania is trash I have proven my point I think that is pretty nice footage. Yeah, all of Sonic mania is like that No, I literally just googled Sonic mania gameplay and click the first link I didn't select anything I Don't know how anyone can fight me on that opinion after I showed that clip just now What's that your desktop yeah, you like my desktop you like it It goes on over there and over there there's three of these and they're all like this It's just as chaotic as his desktop I Don't mean it's just nostalgia made game for me. That's when people are back in me because I'll look that low Sonic 3 Possibly I mean, I never thought of it like that. I kind of just like evaluate the game the way it is But I don't want to think about all where the motivations for making this game good or bad By the way, the president is with warrant of death and I'll see It's not that bad Maybe like 15 years in prison, but that come on Okay, I think this works for like a wind turbine we just need a good texture here and then this will look perfect Not yet, but I find something Oh Shit fucked up Yoshi of the week. Let's go God You see some shit You should horizontally murder you use here for alternating faces they are horizontally remote Hello Maui Did you take a look at the volley detection just like volley to space Isn't that like a famous texture by this point If The thing about this turbine is it looks kind of shitty right now, but maybe we can save this a bit This is also 150 triangles, which is kind of a lot. Maybe we should make this a hexagon or just a square the problem is a square turbine is gonna look really stupid an Hexagon one is also gonna look stupid. What can we do? I don't chill gamma. Hello deagle ninja So this is supposed to be the metal part of the turbine here Pretty basic curve part on blenders icosphere Yes, I could The problem with making an icosphere is that the boundaries here are hard to get right at the top Because we would have to cut off the icosphere. Oh You're looking for a volley just face texture basically But we could use actually never mind there's a good part here So, yeah, we could use that That might be a good idea Right, so I looked into that file back. I don't know if I have the original file for it anymore I think it's just the texture I have but I'll look again before I forget See if I can actually track it down Yeah, and I cusp your hold on it's honestly a good idea I can't find a file back. I can just remake it because that literally took 30 seconds to make But I'll see if I can track it down I'm gonna see you actually know this is like way too many trying kids. I don't know about this one  Don't know if I can track it down And having a one is me No, I'm not a fan of the icosphere now that I think about it I think it will have to be this Or something like that. Use the texture to make it look round Well making it look round is not the issue. The issue is that I I don't like like this rim here I think this rim looks stupid I Kind of want this to be sharp, too I don't know bumsy 2d Hello waffle dude, i'm working on a new video for dimension right now it should be releasing I think two weeks from now It's about sine and cosine approximations. It's getting kind of wild the video Probably finish editing it tomorrow And then I have to finish editing a video for a conference that they want me as a speaker I had for some reason So Really Biobak the only issue I have is trying to track the damn thing down It might just be faster to recreate it Of those games that wanted the detailed sprites of sonic but because it's on the snes you can't see nothing I Love sonic more detailed than like mario world Yes, this is part of return to yoshi's island which will be the big hack that i'm working on It is course 11 out of 15 So 11 means we are already pretty far Dude i'm gonna have a vacation in a week, too So with that vacation I can probably stream a lot On 6400 is not that great as you might think honestly The april 1st video did so well That I think i'm gonna do a video every april 1st exactly like that. It's gonna become a tradition I wonder if we can see the video where your speaker when it's done all or the process of so we can't No, it will be public I don't know if it's going to be on my youtube channel right away Let's see, what's a good texture for oh this one could work for turbine I mean, it will definitely be made public like at some point that is still doing exactly. I know the conference is in like august So I Guess it was unarguably good video. I don't care what's on your full stroke. It was fun to watch Yeah, I know just people really liked it. They were just complaining that was too verbose I wonder if we make one every year. I wonder if as the years go by Being so over length and like unnecessarily verbose will become more and more acceptable Because I have the theory that right now Youtube is in the background noise matter. You're not supposed to make engaging videos You're supposed to make videos that can be listened to while they're in the background And that is what will get you the views So youtubers are gonna feed into that Videos are going to become more and more background noise and less content Okay now Now that I see this, I actually need to do this differently. I think next year should be about making high quality rocks, not gonna lie. I don't know if I can make high quality rocks. What's the conference about? It's like a tech conference about, you know... It's kinda like about doing things differently than you would just expect in the industry, I guess. So it's kinda about reverse engineering is what I'm gonna have my thing about. So I'm gonna talk about how to hack N64 games. Talking about how to hack an assembly and stuff like that. Don't even back on us, but I don't even watch YouTube videos on their own anymore, it's always while I'm doing something else. Exactly, that is the meta. That's what you make the videos for. How to survive Nintendo Ninjas? Nah, it's gonna be about just hacking, just code. You had no idea that video was an April Fool's joke? You know what's depressing? Even though that video was an April Fool's joke, it did better than most of my normal videos. I think it did. Yeah, like this one, I worked super hard on this video. 120k. This stupid fucking meme video, 160k. My preview of just making a level that I spent hundreds of hours on, 120k. This one, 40k. Randomizer, 40k. No one gives a shit about anything. This revolutionizing N64 programming, less than fucking Grass April Fool's video.  How insulting would it be if someone were to just say skill issue? About what? About the Grass video doing better than the rest of the video. How's that skill issue? I don't know. Hello Lila. What is up Lila? They don't want to see code, they want to see the funny Wahoo man jump. Yeah, but like even the level previews. I mean, okay, but the video about the physics not being perfect, like that's not code. That's actually me just showing the funny man Wahoo. Wahoo. Okay, this looks kind of good. I do like it. Fix Bowser's flaw? Are you fixing all the models for them? Okay, but when am I getting my Quatrainian animations? You gotta put hot takes in the title and thumbnail to get views. N64's physics aren't perfect? Come on, that's a good title. Because this is a trend of touching grass is my favorite video game. Maybe. Thumbnail is great. The N64 Smash is very sensible information when it comes to programming and features. Yeah, I mean for programmers my videos are probably very good. But like for casual viewers, I need to do more shitposts. I have a list of videos I have planned. You guys tell me what you think about these, alright? My video ideas here. I generated these with ChatGPT. How much RAM does Mario 64 really need? That's like a video. How big does the Mario 64 ROM really have to be? Because right now it's 8MB, it could probably be 4MB. How good is the FastNWareSquareRooter algorithm on the N64? That's not funny, yahoo man, unfortunately. How much did the optimizations on Mario 64 actually help? Yeah, none of these are really the funny yahoo man. Oh, this one could be the funny yahoo man. The most amazing unused feature on Mario 64. That sounds like a clickbait video. How does Mario 64's mirror work? It's really really boring. I was thinking of maybe just porting Mario 64 to Unreal Engine 5 real quick. And the Worms Fortress remake. Yeah, I guess making video ideas is difficult. How much RAM does Mario 64 really need?  I think I get more excited about anything that's about optimizing even worse. Because I know you'll put more room in your games. Yeah. Alright, let's make the fan blades. Let's make like 16 blades. Alright, I cannot find that texture file back. Or at least I can't find the old PSD for it. Let's make some more fan blades. Ah, I switched to local space. No. Okay, I figured out. Dude, scale. What the fuck is happening? Oh, I only have one vertex selected. They are conventional, but you need to type them properly. Don't say how big should the run be. Say I fit two fan blades. Two copies of Super Mario 64 into one SM64 canvas.  Say the Mario and SM64 has been lying to you. Shit, dude. Yeah, those are insane titles. When I went to the weather report, I thought Nutter coped and gave up because people said it was bad. Yeah, I think people saying it was bad was kind of a bummer for Nutter. But I'm probably still gonna just make it. That's because I like programming, but speaking of porting. Would it be possible here to make a decent port on the PS1? I have no idea. I don't know the PS1. When they showed Super Mario 64 in Mario 64. Dude, but imagine me just porting Mario 64 to Unreal Engine. Just to like, do it. Just so people would stop bothering me about the PC port. Case, when are you doing the PC port? Look, I made it in Unreal Engine. I don't need the PC port. Wouldn't that be nice? What kind is the PC port? The PC port. The PC port. PC port, Case. When are you gonna port it to the PC port? Kind of looks bad. We need a better texture than this. I made the Mario 64 from normal. No! Do the Nintendo hire this man move? No, I could actually just port Mario 64 to the PC port one-to-one. Or I could even pick the Odyssey model and rig him up with Mario's animations from Mario 64. And then take the Odyssey Bob-omb's Battlefield remake or something. Maybe the PC port version was actually worse than an emulator. Do you know how much people would hate me for that? I don't know. It's still entirely emulated along with audio and input. The only thing that's running is the input itself. But it's a PC port, so you have to use it. I'll be doing the Mario 64 in Unreal Engine. I have yet to use the song in the intro. At least the first guitar solo. It's too bad we don't have a point system anymore. Otherwise I would be requesting that song as we speak. Unlucky. How do you think of my turbine? That's a pretty good turbine. I like it. There's a man who has artistic vision. He's showing off Nintendo with each decision. He made it in a flash. And all the assets clashed. This man who leaves doesn't know no boundaries. Is that how it goes? I don't remember. I'm pretty sure I got it wrong. But it's fine. It's 44! 44 triangles. Come on, we're fine. Do I like the shower garden? Dude, that is so funny that you mentioned it. Because just yesterday I got all the emblems in the shower garden on the Gamecube. On the Xenos Brothers' own. They had 171 emblems. They were missing all the shower garden ones. I just came over and got all of them. Can you combine opposite blades into a quad to hold the blade? No, because then they would be oriented the other way. Like if you look at this and this. I mean, it's an interesting idea, yeah, but it doesn't work. Oh no, I should have triangulated these first. I should have triangulated these first. Dude, I thought most of these would go the right way around. Why do they not? What is this? This is so random. You would think I could select all of them and set them to fixed, but that doesn't work. The option you select here only applies to the last object in memory. Which is very stupid. Dude, I can't wait to show you the updated Zuma. I think it looks so good. Okay, I'm kind of hyped. Let me get the circuit PC port and I can support very huge ROMs. Project 64 can do that too. There have been people making like 200 megabytes ROMs in Project 64. So that's not bad at all.           Anything to write home about. Imagine I put your mother into a romance experience where I cause performance issues. It's an April 1st video. Some guy told me that was the case. Oh, the PC port doesn't have any graphical duration, of course. Dude, yeah, don't argue with the YouTube army. I have a very offensive thing to say, but I will refrain. I will refrain. Try not to die. At least not on my stream. I don't want to get banned. If you're going to die, do it in the bathroom. I don't want to get banned. I love how your name is. I don't want to get banned off of YouTube. This man has his priorities straightened out, everybody. All right, that's a turbine. It's funny that programmers run an assembly and then messed up optimizing C codes. Wait, what? Who programmed an assembly? He wasn't in new language in 1990. No, no, no. Look, in 1996, no one knew anything. They had just invented technology. There's no way they could have known C at that time. I don't want to do that. Sounds useless. They didn't even know what a Mario was.  Miyamoto just one day came up to them and said, I want a Mario. And they were all confused. And then they just had to go through like a hundred iterations before finally Miyamoto agreed that they made a Mario. Is it Linus Torvalds? Is that the guy Linus Tech Tips? Linus. Shit, what level are we working on right now? Let's play Prime World. OK. He definitely doesn't love Rouge singing this song. The guy that made Linux. Oh. Working on Oily Boily Bay. That is the actual name. Yes. I should have named the stream that. Dude, Oily Boily Bay is so fun to say. I'm so glad that's the name I agreed to. I just looked at the code and thought about how it would look like an x86 assembly. Isn't the guy who made Linux? I didn't get that in there. Wait. OK. Never mind. It's just other people talking to each other. I don't need to read those out. Yeah. The wind turbine needs fog. I just selected a weird option and I don't know what it was. Hopefully that didn't break anything. Turbine. So we're just going to edit the collision model so that this is just a flat collision. So you don't actually fall into the turbine. I thought Oily Boily Bay was temporary. It's not 100% guaranteed that we will go with Oily Boily Bay, but it is a strong contender. I think it's a pretty good one. I think so, too. But you never know that you found the best thing. Sneeze. It looks to me like it will blow you. It will blow you, but it's not 100% always active, you know. Or maybe it will always be active. Yeah, we haven't decided on that, actually. Is this going to be always active or does this go on and off in intervals? What's the best way to make this platform here? I kind of like it going on and off in periods. That way there's a bit of a timing aspect to it. You could long jump from here, go into that and have the timing right so it would shoot you very far. Which I think is a very cool way of doing it. So let's do the beeper. BP1, time off. BP2, time on. BP3, direction. Okay. Switch action. So it's going to be off, on and off. Timer, over beeper. One of the eights. Oh, I can't type. Then now we are on and we go off. So we do BP1, 2. Go to 2. And then we go off again. So, well actually I can go back to zero. Easier than I thought. And then BP3. So we have one horizontal one and one vertical one. Let's see. It's going to go really fast. It's going to accelerate pretty fast too. This is maybe a bit too fast acceleration. And this is going to be angled well.  Yaw? Did you say yaw or jaw? There is a function to process the rotation speed. What is it called? And how do I never use it? Yeah. Well this function is fucking useless. It's never used. What about this one? I should use this more often. There seems to be a few lines of code. When is the MrBeast in Super Mario 64? Mind blown. An investment from the zoo. And I love that room that's a cafeteria. 200m wide and one table at each end of the room. With four boxes and one pillar randomly scattered in between. That was modeled for fun, okay? Besides, it's Wario's cafeteria. It's not a very nice cafeteria. Rotation speediness? No, that's not what it's called. Where is the windmill that blows you? It's in course, no it's in the cloud cap level, wind cap level. So, it should be somewhere around here, spear guy, good roll, yoshi god, let it rip mine, web scuttler, ninja, windmill propeller, here we go. What the f**k, oh it's cylindrical collision, I see. It needs to be declared somewhere so I can actually access it from everywhere, yep good enough. Oh right, so this is only from where that actually pushes, I see. And then this is the initial overlap, okay. S**t I didn't pay any attention to chat, what's going on, probably wouldn't be extremely hard to implement but it'd be funny, what would be funny? We may just intersect and we're all setting the level on fire, no, yes that would be very hard to implement. How much did we make this big, like 400? 403, let's just do 400 then. I did not just do 400. This is almost always gonna be true, so I'm just gonna put that second. So we have this minus that and then this is gonna be like a thousand if Mario is a thousand units above, so we're gonna subtract a thousand and then if Mario is exactly on it it's gonna be minus a thousand, that's not what we want, yes that is what we want. Let's do two thousand, no actually a thousand is good. And then we need to multiply this by a small number, if you're like exactly on top of it this is gonna result in a thousand and we would want like maybe 10, so 0.01. And this should only apply if Mario's velocity stays below like 48. I think you can design some fun puzzles around having some turbines on and off and hitting buttons to invert a state. Yeah, yeah. Hmm, the thing is we really want this to become like so puzzling, as long as we make the puzzles like baby easy I'm up for that. Hello crazy guy room, that is pretty good to hear. This is like a weird code structure, I don't think I've ever done this before. So let's have this be off for like two seconds and then on for like eight seconds, see how that works out. Oh, I forgot a thing, I didn't even want to copy this, I wanted to copy the particle response.  That's what we want, kind of. Oh no. Do we want the negative rotation? I'm not sure about that one yet. Let's default to negative just to match the old code. Right now the particles would go vertically, which is not good. Horizontally, which is not good, I want them to be vertical. So let's make the vertical particles forward by 0, 0, 80, 20. Let's see it. Shit. I'm missing the variables. Oh, there we go. Well, if I did everything right, it will just work now. You have a turbine that blows you off the platform, so you need to push something in front of it. Oh, that's what you mean. Can I remake Super Trump 64? Dude, if Trump goes up for presidency in 2024, that would like be the best Romhack remake of all time. I would remake that in the RTYI engine. How cool would it be if Super Trump 64 was the most optimized Romhack of all time? Okay, well, most of this works. And it rotates way too fast. Way too fast. Holy shit. What's that? Maybe I'll make it the most HD Romhack you've ever seen. Super Trump 128. Let's go. Actually, though, like, okay, Super Trump 64 was made in 2016. Back in 2016, you could make stupid edgy jokes and it was funny. 2024? I don't know how funny it would be. Because I feel like a lot of people would actually be very upset about the situation like that. If they think it's like a life or death thing. I got really upset when you uploaded the clip of, um... What was it again? It's the one that, um... Was it the Chaz one that people got upset about? Yeah. I got really upset about that. Yeah, exactly. And that's the horror here. Should I not make it about taking controlled environments and running away with them? Well, we'll have to see what the memes are going to be like first. Can't plan without knowing the memes. No, the problem is not that the turbine spins too fast. The problem is that the turbine spins so fast that you can't visually see how fast it spins because the refresh rate of the game is too low. Right now it's too slow. Let me just do this by defiance. Turbine speeds. Let's do this. Easier to take the numbers like this. I should also move the spawn location. Green screen, 26.1. 26.1. Sheltered. Nice. Welcome to the stream. I remember when I was a kid, the Mad Piano was scary. When you write your numbers in hex instead of decimal, I'm mentally ill. Yeah, I can change it, but I don't have a better one. Oh, this was supposed to be minus 0.01, that's why it doesn't work. Thumping Koopas.  Should I be spinning the other direction? Should I? Maybe I should. Should I model it the other direction? Man, this sucks. It's like barely even gives me a boost. Weakest turbine ever. Do you know if the direction spins right now or whatever? It's sucking, Aaron. Yeah, I flipped it. You're right. It's actually a pretty strong turbine. I'm sure if you were to walk on the turbine, you'd just get shredded. Yeah? What do you know from my shots? What do you know from my shots? Oh, I'm mentally ill, yes. What the fuck? Get it round to 0. I'm gonna take a lot more time to accelerate. I'm gonna take a lot more time to accelerate. Still not feeling it. Hmm. Maybe this should be a bit bigger because the turbine is so far down. Maybe 80 is not enough. 70 is not enough. Let's find a new max speed. Like this. Still don't see why this is just going to 0. What is your particle feedback? Particle spawn speed needs to be tied to angle speed and angle speed needs to be accelerated a bit more slowly. Okay. I like tying the particle speed to that, yeah. That is a fair suggestion. The question is... Oh, here. Okay. Yeah, let me do that real quick. What's the field called? If you're still in the chat, I sent you the texture. And accelerating it more slowly. Surely that can be done easily. Let me increase the timeout a bit. Actually, I'll just do that here at the level. Now we need to figure out why it just stopped working here. Is this song currently playing? That's the Chao race song from the Chao Garden. Such a troll song. Okay, let's just... This is a debugging thing we're going to call Mario. The thing accelerates him just to see what's happening. There is a fun and fair Mario 64. Oh, I see an issue. The Y definitely needs to be set higher. And for some reason, the angular pitch doesn't actually... I know why. It's because this is a negative speed. Yeah. That explains all of it. Because the turbine is going in the negative direction. And there are so many VS Code error scales. I don't know how to turn them on or off. I know that you can get rid of them and make everything work properly. But I don't know how. And I just decided... I don't care. Dude, now it's going way too slow. What the fuck? It doesn't necessarily mean anything. What? It's too slow. Here's acceleration. How much is this? It's one second now. It was two and a half seconds before. Guys, I'm good at programming. I'm not good with technology. You will have to just live with me having all these error squiggles. It is just how my life is now. I've accepted it. This is part of it. Someone on Twitter once told me how to turn them off. But that turned the search bar into shit and the search bar into shit. The search bar is more important to me than getting the errors. It almost looks like the turbine speed went way too low. I wonder if with the higher acceleration it's going to be better. Wait a minute. Why are you also calling me Linus Torvalds? What's that Linus do? That doesn't work. What's that Linus Torvalds? It's all just from multiplying with the angle of the pit. Okay, I see the issue. I just put the wrong variable here. I don't know how that was the right speed at all. It's because of the random range. It will look a lot better now. If you're a pro gamer, you're going to time it. Into something like that. I think this works pretty well now. Oh, something weird happened here. I need to fix that real quick. I got triangulated all weird. What's with the lighting on this? Like, huh? I don't understand what's going on with the lighting here. It might not be there in-game. You may have seen this in Aladdin, right? No spin jump. There is a spin jump you can do by pressing A, Z and then A again. And there's a dive jump you can do by pressing A, Z and then B. But it is entirely optional. You never need this to actually beat the game. You can play the game without it if you want. Dude, whenever I showcase anything on YouTube, people always ask for options. How come people like options so much in video games? Okay, maybe that's the right question to ask. Maybe... How do I better word this? People are asking for more options than are worth it. Like, they are asking for options on every little detail. That was good, yeah, but like people were asking like, oh, can we get an option to like F the old health bar back? Can we have an option to switch between your new breath meter and the old breath meter you have? Can we have an option to switch between the new font and the old font? Stuff like that. Which very clearly should not be an option. Like at that point, just make your own game. Okay, so we got our wind turbine. We can also do a horizontal one now. I'm not a fan of the idea of my cat, honestly, with the... You know, the thing. The thing in the sky, you know? I mean, having options in a game aren't a bad thing, but those don't seem like options. Those are just cosmetic things that people prefer. Yeah, kinda. Let me check that the horizontal tube works as well. I would be very surprised if it worked right away, but let's see. Can we have an option for no foreskin on Mars model? Sure, buddy. Having an option to have not have hints or three options are good. Accessibility? Sure.  I don't know about that. Maybe like an option to turn off tutorials, if there were any. Sure. I put in the wrong beeper room. I've been reviewing Origami King with my GF and it really cemented the fact that I f***ing hate Olivia forever. Yeah, f*** Olivia, dude. Oh my god, I hate her. But that's different. That's not just... Yeah, that's... Okay, that is completely different from just hints. Olivia is just baby mode. She just tells you what to do. Olivia is like a backseat gaming option. You can turn on and off. Not just backseat gaming, like backseat gaming and wasting your time. Oh, it kinda works. It's not strong enough, but... And it's going the wrong direction. Employs are dumb, but she explains the combat mechanics and fills for first three fights. Yep. And even then, the fights are still simple. Look, this is my only Origami King memory that I really have like a strong memory of. Remember, there was one thing that was a no. Mandatory fight. And I have to keep in mind from fights, you get absolutely nothing in this game. The fights are just a pure waste of your time. And instead of doing the fight normally, I just took the controller, I went to the toilet, I took a shit and I just smashed A and I won the fight. So you really don't need a tutorial for that. Because you can literally do it without thinking. While taking a shit and not looking at the screen. That is set to 30. Holy shit. 30 is a strong one. I think the game is going to accept the fights and the waste of rendering power that is Olivia. Yeah. Origami King feels like an experiment they made to see if they could make a game fun without adding any kind of extrinsic motivation. And they went hard on not adding any extrinsic motivation. That made all the random encounter fights really bad though. Hmm. There's so many mice holes in this goddamn cafeteria. Is that? Oh, oh. And the zoo. Because there's actual mice in there and they're animated. And that's it. I just wanted to look filthy, you know? What? You will fix what, Lilaa? What will you fix, Lilaa? Okay, so we have a problem with the turbine. And that is that rotating both the pitch and the roll doesn't actually rotate them the way we want. But I'm guessing the jaw doesn't either. Fix the cutouts. What's wrong with them? Can't get them much prettier than this. Yeah, dude. They're fucking dancing mice. What can you do? It is what it is. But there's no way that I can't rotate it this way. The fuck? So. What's wrong with them? The outline? Yeah, it looks good to me. Let me, let me look at this in game. Are all my cutouts bad? Let me see. Which texture is this? 2A Rikonuki. This? What color would you like them to be? This color, right? And then this. Mode, index colors. Oh wait, I need to do this. Mode RGB, delete them. Mode index colors, accept. And now it should work. I'm only doing this one as an experiment to see if Lilaa is happy with it. I actually think games are better if you have less options, but the options that are there are satisfactory. The cutouts are still black. It didn't do anything. What can I do? Let me do it. Why don't we rotate it this way around 90 degrees? It's bizarre how no matter whether I change the roll or the pitch, it's always fucked. Blocked? I tried! It didn't work. What do you want me to do? Nope, it's still fucked. Okay, what if I switch back from roll to pitch? It's something to do with how all the rotations are applied in a certain order. That makes it so that both the pitch, the roll and the jaw all don't rotate it on the axis that we want. It's just gimbal lock or whatever. Hey! So we have to rotate them 90 on the pitch, 90 on the roll and then 180 degrees on the jaw. And that's what will make the turbines the way we want. That is fucked up. That is like the most fucked up game engine ever. I hate Euler angles. Nope, rotating it 180 degrees on the jaw axis did nothing just now. It literally did nothing. What? So... I am so confused by this. Get named quattro onions, I wish. Dude, once you guys see the sine cosine approximation video, you are going to feel so bad for me. The shit I had to go through. Get so excited for a second. At this point, it might as well be random. Whatever happens, happens. Yeah, add an option for Mario to have to beat the Griffin Gym case. I think options are good for the players. How is it that this is the pitch and the other thing is the roll and the jaw is not going to rotate it on the z-axis? It won't. Just for shits and giggles, I'm gonna make a rotate on the jaw and it's gonna look exactly like the pitch, isn't it? I think you need a gay Yoshi option. There is a Yoshi that is maybe a little gay. Yes, those eyebrows. That's it. That's what makes him gay. Yep, he's rotating on the jaw and it's the same as the pitch. Fucking gimbal lock. I hate this. How did I do this with the windmill? How did I manage to do it before? Hello, Pi. Welcome to getting upset and gimbal lock. Hi, Pi. Oh, I know how I did it before. I know exactly what I did before. This is annoying, but look what we have to do. We have to take the model. We have to rotate it 90 degrees in the 3D model. This is the only way to do it. We have to rotate it in the 3D model and make it another separate model. And now it will work. Did you know for the role of Joker in the fucking movie, blah, blah, blah, meme Batman. Joaquin Phoenix had to deal with the gimbal lock for 30 minutes. Getting me. I bet we have to go back to the role now. I bet. Please. It should at least be possible now. I don't think it was possible before. Remember when my version of SketchUp was not very comfortable with my version of it and I had to rotate all my levels by 90 degrees on the X axis. Come on. Okay, finally, we did it guys. It's repeating. It is changing its role as we want. So we can last 10 minutes of stream and make it the case versus gimbal lock video with a laugh. Hahaha. That would make for a banger video. Actually, I want to make a turbine. Maybe just put a platform. Yeah, let's leave all the work we did just now. Fuck it, we just put a platform. MFs will never believe you how fucking hard it was to make this thing spin this way around. Alright, so this is going to be the red coin area. We want there to be a bunch of red coins here and we need a cool way of making this feel. We got the turbines now. The turbines are going to be very cool platforming things. I definitely want one red coin you get by just jumping on a turbine and going up. Just animate the texture. But couldn't you now use that model of the role for all of them? Yes, I can use this for all the role models, but I can't use it for... Actually, maybe I can use it for the other one. But I don't care right now. Make a video about it. It would be very funny. We're not using an animated texture. That would look awful. So I'm going to put one red coin like here. We're going to make it so that you jump from here to here. And obviously this turbine is not going to be actually here. This is just like the model we have. If you rotated your visor it wouldn't be so bad. That's true, but you would easily tell that it's not 3D. Especially because there's like real sunlight, right? So you would see that the sunlight is not properly reflecting off the turbine. So do I like other angles? Well, yeah. What bug took you the longest to fix? There was a bug where a certain thing was DMA copied from the ROM to the RAM. But it was a stack variable. So depending on which code you would call this code from, it would put the stack pointer to something that was not aligned by 16 bytes. And then DMA copy would produce invalid values only on real N64 and not on the emulator. So figuring that one out was a little difficult. That would be a good spot for the red coin star to appear. Because if we have all this, then the red coin star should probably just be like... Maybe here? Or somewhere over here? Maybe probably over here, yeah. Just like in the corner. I'm just putting it temporarily like over here. So I want this to be like on the same axis here. We know that... Okay, so we want to make this as easy as possible, obviously. And we know that Mario will have 48 speed and he will have around 80 vertical speed. So we make this like so. That should make it perfectly reachable with just a jump. And I like to make it so that it's very obvious that you're supposed to get it during that jump. Let me see if that works out. I don't care about Doom, so that's not something I would do. I never played Doom. Oh, I slightly missed it. But the concept looks like it would work. Maybe I should make it a bit higher up. Or maybe I should put less vertical velocity from these. I don't know, I kind of like this amount of velocity. It's very snappy. What do you think? But I'll put the red higher up. It will be cooler Port good paper Mario game to the m64. It's a sticker star. Yeah, let's fucking go stick a star at this No, no, we might not even as a joke fuck that game. Oh Yeah, I like it Okay, how do we continue no, please don't snore to my ear Mario Let's see, how could we continue this we have a bunch of platforms that move between these like back and forth that I want to use a lot Oh We could absolutely put them into his win state. Yeah. Now that I think about it. He should be put into his win state It's section state to one You Let's see how the vertical win state would work out We keep the watching shooting things to run What does that mean? We go and send blows Panda I'd have to move this closer here Guess what? I go in says more gravity then long jump, but that is actually good because this Reduces the amount of things that might happen when you jump in there because now we at least know the gravity Mario will have So in a way, this is good also allows us to put the red coin like above of this it's a bit more compact All right, I have not planned the f3 yet, but there might still be one the thing is I have a lot of shit to do The Yoshi egg went wait, that's not good Also shoutouts to 50 few to viewers today, that is a new record for YouTube usually we don't have that many I am happy about that. I am trying to transition from twitch because twitch is going down the gutter And having more YouTube viewers makes that transition easier for me Yes, I was worried that I would lose a lot of Interest from people if I just went to stream YouTube now I Think we'll see what you've gone by this time in the next couple years. No, it's too big to fail I'm kind of thinking of raising this platform vertically Let's try it You It's transition but that reminds me I was at the doctor's office last week we read it for three hours, by the way That's why I couldn't stream. We were free. I was at the doctor's And he diagnosed me with a tennis elbow. He said he might have to Inject steroids into my elbow and I got hyped for a second. But then he said it's just cortisol so I said nah, I Thought I would get a steroid prescription that would have been funny But nah, he just wants me to inject cortisol and take painkillers. I said no, I'll just treat myself fuck off Doctors Doctors have such a scam in Canada to not just in Germany. I Mean our issue is that we just don't have a lot of doctors I'm not with Germany. It has the same issue that we do here. It's from jacking off too much. No I'm lifting weights. It's an athlete injury. Okay You Now he wanted me to dig like Now pox in or something He says very strong painkiller and I don't even know why he wanted me to take the painkiller. It made no sense Oh Have I not Interesting I guess I accidentally move myself as well So we both elbows then no, it's just one elbow just the right one for some reason I So what Final level was only used for babies first platform again Yeah, that's Okay, that's a tough decision because hey I have the issue here The thing is people are going to try to 100% them and if there's one thing that is much more difficult than the rest Of the game people are going to get really frustrated with it Having a super hard final level is only really reasonable if There's a lot of content that like all the stupid casual players are not gonna attack But so because we have 44 or 45 of these Yoshi stars. I Think that might be enough of a buffer for people to be like, yeah, I beat the game any percent. No, I'm done and I Would really like to have a fuck and fuck. I know boss level But like I'm a little horrid saw You Then I'm presuming when you get everything else like super Mario 3d world Yeah That would be the way I would do it Falling blanks can think there will be a collision there. I mean just not making the collision map while we working on the model visually Maybe Maybe having a scene there We go again with the options a final a really difficult final level with the option to have checkpoints at that point It's not difficult anymore And why would anyone turn off the option to have a checkpoint that kind of just ruins it, right? What I meant earlier with people want options on everything I Sorry one's gonna be like well would be 174 stars or 175 One very easy way to fix it. What is it? Just Add more options. Oh, right. Why didn't I think of that? Should there be a red coin up here is the question there isn't really a reason to go here other than maybe for a red coin When anyone disable Mario Odyssey's easy mode you have to enable it first I Mean when like Odyssey that prevents you from falling in the white you see double health and don't see where to go Like for the entire game I Guess but still people wouldn't use that what they You You see how this works out here Like an amiibo compatible no I Kind of like your baby mother suggestion yes, I recognize that falling into the white and mark 64x can be really frustrating This is a cool red coin Double health would also be somewhat easy to implement, right? Change the way how this displayed I Shouldn't be a way to get up there without many weird jumps. I Don't like that getting up there is difficult or odd Basically anything should be possible without a back jump. It's my prerogative. Is that the correct way to use the word prerogative? I Don't know what the word means You even went on that wait, did I not re-export this just now and fix it Then I literally fixed this like just now lost it still a bug Final option the guy can predict when I die When I just make the top a single quad because then the UV stone work How am I supposed to do the UVs if there's just a single quad You Yeah, now that I think about it I can just go without that I Makes landing there a bit more difficult unless I also What the fuck oh, no, we're back Maybe I'll have to play to purchase one or more bubbles with coins that are single use I tend to bring you from falling in the void since you can spend coins better make power-ups The problem I have with that is that it kind of encourages a very lame play style Where when there's a difficult level you have to exit the level go to the shop Go to the level try the level with your bubbles. If you fail you reset the game you go to the shop, you know It adds a lot of misery to the game and takes away the tension Ideally the game would be designed in a way that The tension is just ideal for the amount of misery you get I Wait, I'll look at your thing. What is the thing you sent me? Oh Shit that's a very cool stream banner. I like this All right, we have a new stream banner When you're she says meant for all I'll make it feel better already Yeah But we don't know how the oil it's gonna look at right there might be some levels that really take a while to walk to This was hard to find a reference for the banner, but yeah, you're right. What's your one Yoshi salesman for overworld? It wouldn't be that bad That looks cool, though. I like it Every reference I found for YouTube banners is like the ugliest clip that you've ever seen. Yeah, it's like Hang on. I'm gonna Google YouTube banner and I'll see what the worst one I can find is When Yoshi salesman for all worlds that sells you the bubbles Yeah That would improve the situation I Don't know if I want bubbles to be solved or it seems like It would just make the game like super baby mode for everyone and it feels like it wouldn't really address the real difficulty Which is the general movement in the levels not really falling down. That's difficult. I But the actually difficult aspects are still there It's water with oil on top in the level Well into me oil barrels It's already easy enough, isn't it? Hopefully You All right, that's a bit better Screams vibrating that might just be my camera because I shake my foot a lot No, let's have bubbles there has to be something else we can do if you wanted to make stuff easier The final level would be so cool, so I definitely want them The camera in game was vibrating when following the star. Oh, whoops. That could be maybe that was a bug You There's nothing of value here it should probably be like a blue coin switch or something Just in case someone goes there. Yeah, let's just have a blue coin switch there forget You We have so few blue coin switch anyway in this game, we still need a redesigned blue coin switch the one we have right now It's super ugly You Yeah, this level is a bit improvised compared to my normal levels We're kind of making a lot of shit up on the fly So some of this will be a bit odd But it's fine. Then parts of this are very modular so we can just make up shit on the fly Now what you see around here is water that is infested with oil You can see the rainbow effect on it. That's the oil and The reason it looks so orange is because the Sun is reflecting on it Yeah Yeah situations like that is what I'm worried about like a normal casual player might have trouble with that I picked up a model I Picked the whole wrong behavior. How did I do that? You Then the Sun to the skybox, yeah, maybe That I think on this orange and black lines look terrible great It's out of egg though. So Unexpected probably have to still like mark sharp That Priority makes it a lot better. Yeah But nothing about me but to have heatwaves on this level I was super my central vehicles were built no, no, no, that's That's the thing you could do but it'd be like an n64 only effect and I would add like two frames of input like That's why I don't like it. I mean the input like would be there if you played it on that I fully intend to please the source because when it's done and I might backport it to the original 64 if you want But that's obviously gonna be a lot of work that's gonna be in the future I Think this platform would be cooler if it was smaller like just until here I Just this part, I don't know it's fun. I Don't want there to be too much empty that air here You And we got two red coins already, that's pretty good. Filing on your knight in the wrong place. All right, what's our next mechanical trick gonna be here for the red coins? Can I just have to make up shit? I like the horizontal wind turbines to be kind of an obstacle, but also a helper in some places. And I like this to get really high and crazy, like the Rico Harbor stuff. Oh, and like, yeah, yeah, there's some cool ideas here. Yeah, the game is currently running. Currently not in a state where it would run very well. It would, like, keep crashing. I mean, it runs, like, very fast, but, like, not very stable. But I'm pretty sure I can nail down all the issues. What is that line? I noticed that before. I never made an effort to just delete it. I want the player to get on the crane directly without the wind turbine. And the crane is a cool platforming mechanic. The cranes are so cool. I like them a lot. There could also be a hook here to climb on. There should be hooks. I want more hooks. I think this is still gonna run a lot better than the M&M branch. Just because of stuff like the cashbox optimization, which I consider to be kind of a major optimization. All right, let's add the ability to add a hook to these here, the cranes. And then we can have this crane being here, and having the hook be so that you can just grab it. Let's just make hook an option case. Case, yes. Make a hook an option. Make it so that some versions of this game ship without it, and you can choose which one to buy, case. Yeah, even 5 FPS seems a bit optimistic for some of the levels. When you look at Bunny Brushfoot's in the original Mario 64 engine, it was, like, plenty FPS. And then after the first rewrite, it was, like, 44 or something? And then we made the engine another, like, 1.5 times faster. So 30 FPS level, 5 seems about right. I know that the zoo was, like, 9 FPS on the original engine, and now it's, like, 40, 50. Actually, my eye has—or, Ludicrous One has—anomaly draw distance here. Wait, let me show that, actually. I don't know if you guys have seen this yet, but I want to show you my course 1. Y'all seeing it? I hope it's not too loud. What is going on? My N64 was working earlier. Fixed frame ratio? No. Dude, the input delay here is so awful. Holy shit. Because of my capture card. Be prepared to just be completely blown away. Look at this. This is an N64 game. How crazy is that? The audio's lagging? Not for me. Oh, oh. I know why the audio was lagging. Is it better now? I was playing on two different sources. How insane is this? Like, holy shit. It runs just fi—just fine. It does that when it goes below 30 FPS. I literally don't even think it's crazy to say anymore that this looks like a GameCube game. Yeah, 20 FPS, the interpolation kind of bugs out, so this happens. I might need to fix that. But this really only happens at the worst point of view. Like, this is as bad as you can make the view. This is if you're trying to make it laggy, and then you get this. I don't know.     It's not something you would see during normal gameplay. Hello, XPM. Hey, XPM. Didn't even try to make it run well.     It's infinite drawing distance. Look, you can see the birds from here. All the way over there. You can see everything. Is this the draw distance? Nah. I think the FPS drop in that area is irrelevant, because you can only be in that area stationary anyway. If that FPS drop happened anywhere where there's a platforming thing, that'd be different. Right, that's a place where you can just look at the scenery. That's a place where you can just look at the scenery. Blue coin switch idea. And I don't like it. Doesn't look like a blue coin switch, and this texture here is a bit eh. Maybe that's because I know this texture from other places already. My audio's popping? How? It's really difficult to make a good blue coin switch, though. I hate the one I made, too. So, rotation flickering down? That's because the 20 FPS approximation algorithm is not good yet. Oh, there it is. I also tried to make the blue coin switch from the newer Mario games, but they also don't offer. So, very difficult. Hmm. Hmm. That's my rotate crane here. Hmm. Hmm. No, that's the Y offset. Hmm. Like, 50. Roughly. It's okay to guess it. Good enough. Forgot what I wanted to type halfway through and just give up. I'll find something eventually, yeah. Although, I recreated or I remade them when I was in Quest 3, I think, or Quest 4, and we're still stuck with the shitty version, so it's about time we find something that works. Otherwise, we might just settle for, like, an HD version of the original. This is kind of funny. We just put two actors next to each other and then one of the actor automatically just attaches to the other actors. That's a way to build a hierarchy. Vacation next week? Yes. I forgot one thing. And then it looks like the red coin switch in sunshine. That's like a little button, right? Let me see. And it looks terrible too. Hello, Sarah Klom. Welcome to programming. Oh, that kind of just stopped on the perfect spot. Well, that's a little more than what I bargained for. Oh, I see. I measured the whole crane size. It's not just the size from the origin. Yes, but the point is that. Let me see. This is interesting. Every time I scan a blender, try pressing G three times or two times and then S for scanning. It can make life easier sometimes. This looks a little better if we could get this to be a coin. The coin shape of this looks awful, though, right? The star shape is kind of nice to look at. This is what happens when I press G three times. Oh, then I can proceed. Oh, yeah, that's a good trick. I like that. That's cool. That is a very good hint. All right, our hook idea already works. That was easy. We just move this into the proper location and then we're good to go on the hook. And we'll attach correctly. You can actually enable or disable UV correction now that you have that blender. Just see a shortcut for it. I mean, pressing G three times instead of two times. That's good enough. That's better than having an option for it. Because now I have a shortcut to just enable and disable it automatically. I much prefer just having a shortcut for it over having an option. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How's that different? Wait a second. Don't I always do this and then... How's that different from what I did before? Wait a second. That is not at all different. That's exactly what I did before. Wait. Oh, is this the UV correction where you press G twice? Oh, okay. Okay, that's a lot less useful than I initially thought. But it's still useful. I now see what that option truly does. Everything just feels unenjoyable for now. Learn a new art or skill. Dive into the meaning of how different wavelengths of light affect human perception and emotion. Did I even export a level? Feels like nothing changed at all. Oh, I didn't move the crane. Oh, I moved everything but... Oh, I moved the rope but not the crane. Cool. I probably moved it way too far now. I can go... Ah, okay, so it also works with scaling. I see. I fear that it's going to be so rare that I'll use that, that I'll probably forget about it next time. But hopefully I won't. Okay, I want to slightly rotate the thing so that it actually stops on the platform. Looks like maybe 5 degrees. I changed my mind to 3 degrees. I changed it back to 5. Can I not just like... I can. I can. That seems good to me. Hello, Wahoo Gangsta. Gasta. Wahoo! Yeah, that makes sense, Shabani. That would explain what's going on. There we go. There's some pro gamer shit you can do on those cranes. Nice. Like that. Which I personally think is very cool. Man, this is going to be the most platformy level yet. Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo! Wahoo! Alright. I think that will be it for today. We made a lot of progress. By next week we'll probably finish the red coin mission. And then we can start programming the level. Which will be very, very fun. We can make all the enemies you can mess with. We can make the cement pit that you can mess with. We can make the soap bar that you ride. All that shit. We'll make a bunch of NPCs. I'll see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye.
