God, it's so warm today, holy shit. Errmm... Hello Exlings. Hello Patrick. I was just now busy with refactoring code. Make more or else, don't worry, I will make more. They are very well paying right now. I have good financial incentive because of sponsors. Without sponsors, I'd be making like 3 videos a year. Your name is where it is, Patrick Kwok. We are loading the level. Any OST wishes today? We'll reload the level. Dying Light OST? Let's go and see if it's any good. Wait what? That looks like a weird game. Is that a game? Oh well. Yes you should mod Mario, it is fun. Undefined reference to Kazoo Girl's circle, what the hell did I do? What just happened? Maybe I just need to wait a little bit longer before hitting compile. Hello Voidpilot, hello Asuko. What is this? It's like either a crazy bug or a compile bug. Guess what? Chicken butt. I've been burned too many times by this, I'm not falling for it. I'll just fuck you, not even the chicken butt. I think I exported right, I just exported too soon. There's still the bug with the seagulls, with them like being able to spawn on the end spine. Which I'm going to try to fix. So today we're working on these guys here. They're going to be sneaking around and then if you go too close to them, they will do that and shoot you upwards. Because I hit compile too early and I hit make clean, it would have fixed itself. At this point I feel like I should make this like a separate function, I won't. Everyone gives me an idea, what if there's a star in order to control the ship and shoot the cannons for a star? No, what the hell, that's changing the entire level. There are xlinks, but it's slow as hell and you need to jump to do it. Actually no, you can do it, but it's slow. Oh pink, it's me. I'm just going to get ejected as fuck. I am pretty musket, oh my god, I look a lot more musket than usual. Oh my god, my back, I never see my back, I didn't know my back looked like that, it's crazy. In Germany, we call this type of music different culture music, fun fact. When you call in there, there is a really funny phone call where, how's it called, the one cellar, and they called it that in that music video, not music video, that phone call, and it is both cellariates. Thinking about it, what I just called in is not even what I need here, I actually want I probably said that before, but that is something I see in response to a lot of people and is it possible to do X, because most things that you can think of, are possible. Hydration check, I did some on the game map, I can drink some water. Hello Palarus. Yes, I'm doing a go to loot, fuck you. We wanted to decline, like so. Like that. Do you ever work on programming projects unrelated to gaming? Very rarely. But we've got a pun to F after an Amandus, because it's a floating point number. That means it's represented as a floating point value and not as an int. Compiler probably doesn't care in these cases, but I still do a lot of mapping. Don't worry, I have no idea what's happening in Seeker 2. My German brother, big lifts. Dude, as soon as they put on a tank top, people all come in here being like, oh my god, case is so small, you couldn't tell before. It's actually crazy. Any new optimizations? Well, I did upload a video on BVH just yesterday. I don't know, maybe that works. I have never ate chocolate chicken. I had chocolate tuna before, and it was disgusting. And that's actually the tuna. I know BVH is just about a file after IC. At this point, honestly, I think I'm done getting stronger. I think my goal now is to just get as lean as possible while maintaining a 315 pound bench press. Because as soon as you hit the 315, the 405 would be amazing, right? But I am fairly certain that to hit a 405, I either need to get really fucking fat, I need to be like 130 kilograms, or I need to do roids. I don't think it is possible for me to hit a 405 in a healthy manner. So I'm just like, I have accepted. I'm a 315 guy. You needn't help with coding. What's a new gen? There's so many more I can make. I was actually thinking, once I am done with my entire inventory, right? Every single thing, and the game is basically ready to release. I was thinking I could do a 12 part series about every single optimization I did. I actually have the parts written out. They would be hardware configuration and intro, compiler settings and AVI, matrix building, collision, engine math, sound, assets, actor handling, game tech, operating system, Mario, and then miscellaneous. What do you think? Does that sound good? Hello, ProcG? If I don't say it yet. It's literally on this channel you're watching right now. Just don't enumerate the videos. Hmm. See, okay, I have an evil plan. My plan is to do 12 parts, each with a sponsor, and then a month afterwards, I take out all the sponsors and make one big, like, 2 hour long video. And it's just going to be like a 2 hour masterclass of how to optimize a video game. Going to be two players? There is a good chance. I'm not going to confirm it, though, until I have verified it's all technically possible. Without insane lag or anything like that. With two players, I'll probably have to kill the graphic thread, though, and just make it always 30 FPS. Let's see. I want him to do swoop, swoop, swoop. Since starts at not zero. So that's not what I want. Since... Divided by... The initial opacity. Which we are going to store somewhere. How does this work out? How does this work out? Hello, Selton. The incident on Saturday, that was fucking funny. Do you think he's going to come back today? He was extremely persistent. Like, I wouldn't be surprised if he came back. I don't even say vroom vroom that much. Like, I barely ever say it. There was one guy that really wanted a three-phase boss fight, but that giant bowser, and the clown car, and Mario Party 8, and Mario 64. Oh, this obviously looks completely horrible. I don't know why. Damn, this actually should be scenes. I don't know why I bought those. When I said the Analog 3D would come out this time, then H-Tech Mo- Wait, you said the Analog- I actually thought- I actually believed that it would come out this time. Is it not going to come out this time? I don't know how much I can say, but yesterday I was talking to someone developing on the Analog 3D, and they showed me some really cool features. So, I was, like, sure it's actually an alive project. Okay, I like the spoopy blobs, actually. Q4 2025? Okay, that's- Q4 started today! It could come out today! Q4 2025? Right now, no, but maybe in the future. Okay. Now that the BVH is done, I kind of want to take a look at doing AI Mario again. Which AI Mario would be a Mario AI, trained in Mario 64, that learns to play Mario 64. Okay. Um... One of the ghosts just left the map. That's what that crash screen meant. Did anything come up like interface to replace the transition control on the base controls? No. I'm going to listen to the error screen. Just stop in your eyes. Okay, they can still leave the map, which is a problem. We need to protect against that. We're just going to protect against it like this. Also, also. They're mirrored. Did you see that? What is an instant static mesh? I mean, I know what instance is, and I know what a static mesh is. Explain what an instant static mesh is, so I can give you an answer. Like, the technical parts of that, not just the name. I know what instance is, and I know what a static mesh is. Explain what an instant static mesh is, so I can give you an answer. Like, the technical parts of that, not just the name. Oh, I can actually just do this. Is that the boobla? It is the boobla. We're working on one. I'm trying to remember. I'm trying to remember. I had to, unfortunately, remove the texture from him. I had to, unfortunately, remove the texture from him. He's now just using vertex colors. The texture was waaaaay too chunky. The texture was waaaaay too chunky. After I scaled it down. So it's this now. It's vertex colors with individual chunks of texture. I'll show you. It looks like this. This is the texture now. You forced that in October? Fair point, actually. I made the off by one error. I made the off by one error. I guess this is proof, I guess this is proof, I am not human. You're rendering the same mesh in all places with a single draw call? You're rendering the same mesh in all places with a single draw call? What is a draw call? Yeah, okay, I don't know what a draw call is. I don't know what a draw call is either. Under the draw call, I understood loading things into the shader pipeline. Under the draw call, I understood loading things into the shader pipeline. Which, I guess, we have an equivalent of that. Loading the texture and setting up the render state. And of course, we can do that. Not set up the texture and render state again. Not set up the texture and render state again. Just put the next mesh data behind it. Just put the next mesh data behind it. Right? Right? Right? But wouldn't literally everything support that? That doesn't sound like a hardware feature. That doesn't sound like a hardware feature. That doesn't sound like a hardware feature. Oh, I'm sure we can add Amiibo compatibility to this. Oh, I'm sure we can add Amiibo compatibility to this. We just need the peripheral for it. Okay, but... Okay, but... You're describing a functionality of it. You're describing a functionality of it. I'm asking for the technical implementation of that so I can give the guy an answer. I'm asking for the technical implementation of that so I can give the guy an answer. More actually using the same LSTI32. Now you make it sound a lot like what exactly what I described with setting up the render state. Which we do have on the N64. There you are. I forgot to do this thing. Okay, should not be less than 100. And actually it should be turned around. Why is no one explaining to me what a drawcode is? Does anyone know? Is it one of those tag words people like to throw around? Because other people have heard it thrown around and we infer meaning through the way people throw them around? No, you needn't help with coding. I also studied mathematics in university, not programming. Does it come out more on GPUs or does it actually give you to begin drawing a bound mesh? And same as when you bind the mesh in Jada once, I draw the mesh with mobile uniforms and transform it with the same call. Oh, you have to actually bind the mesh in the graphic card? Okay, I see. I didn't know that. Uniforms, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transform, transformation, transformation, transform, and this one doesn't quite work the way I want. Why? We go left and then we go right. This actually should be a full one, but also it should take into account the initial facing thing. In general, this console all gets cured, so it doesn't go so long. Yeah, well, I mean, it's the same as N64, right? So, yeah, what I keep saying is, like, the closest, like, there is no draw call, but there is a very close analog, which is, you know, changing textures and real estate in general. Okay, now they change looking around too little. I want them to be, like, you know, very suspicious. I also don't like how much of their body is visible sometimes. That is definitely a problem. I might have to actually make a separate blob mesh here. Okay. Of course. Put him in here. There may be a little too fast running acceleration. That looks a little weird. So, I'm going to have the GPU act like a DMA, so it comes in and out from the CPU. I mean, that's what the N64 does, but it doesn't really make a difference. Oh, well, actually it does make a big difference, but, like, yeah, we already have that. I mean, surely that's how it works everywhere, right? Like, the CPU just writes a list of comments that load things from the RAM, and then the GPU just executes it. I don't know, I find when you look at how the N64 does it, and then you look at how modern hardware does it, it's just like, oh, it's doing it the same way, just slightly more advanced. Like, the N64 is actually just a building block for all modern 3D rendering. It feels like. Anyway. I'm not happy with how he looks in motion here, because this is just, this is a problem. So I'm going to make a separate model that is just a blob. ... ... I still think it's kind of interesting to see that, like, with how much has changed, it's still mostly the same. Don't you think? ... Like, everything's different, but it's still very similar. Don't you think that's interesting? ... ... ... ... I'm not using X2. I'm using X3. That's a microcode Sauron has been working on. Actually, this is exciting. After the stream, I have a call planned for Sauron, where we talk about some of the feature ideas for X3. We might get a few more performance improvements. Yeah, I think this is going to look a lot blobbier. ... Oh, don't worry, this is just, he has two forms. He has one form like this, and then he pops up and turns into the mesh you made, Graham. So, don't worry. It's just that... I don't know if you know what Goobla does. Let me show you the enemy, and you'll understand. Yeah, you can't even see it on this enemy. It's like a blob form and one form like this. I'm making the blob form here. ... That's not like I'm throwing your work away. It's just that I need two forms. Oh, my God! He's here! He still wants to see that boss fight. If you don't see the connection, it's Amazon, but I won't... I need to compromise with you? Why? Why are you my boss right now? Yes, Graham, that's the idea. Gonna be the block, and then the block goes underground, and up comes the big guy. I need different music, man. It's taking me off the song. I need different music, man. It's taking me off the song. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I don't wanna listen to this... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... with this part two ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I need to set the first bit. That's what I'm doing wrong. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... And I'm also sure there was something else I needed to do whenever I do this that I forgot about. ... ... Hit this. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I guess I don't need this. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I don't think I can ban anyone right now, I'm just hoping they leave. You know what actually, that's engagement. You know what, I need engagement, it gets us more views. Think about it like that. Oh that's nice. There's still this one weird frame, do you see that? Am I crazy, what is going on with this one weird frame? Oh that's why. Would you mind wildly derailing the roundtrip with my dear friends during the final boss of the game? Oh sorry, I wasn't asking. Thank you for the engagement. See you're actually giving me financial incentive not to do it, because you typing so much makes YouTube think wow this is a banger stream, people fucking love being here. Think about that, you'll be a kid again. You know what, I think we should go, nevermind, this is perfect already, wtf am I talking about. True, if only the Nvidia drivers could install the appropriate linux headers, my game would be perfect. Ace in shambles. Why all the pleases again, do you actually think pleases do anything? Do you think when you ask your mom for something, I bet 15 more pleases will wear her down and buy me that new lego set? I thought this even as a little child, why are these other children saying please so much? I can't expect to get out of it. At the first place there's a sense of diminishing true, the question is, are they convergent or divergent, you know? See you are putting the conclusion before the question. Is the Obama video any different question? What is the question? Is it about scientist in fields? The answer is, I have no fucking idea. I don't know what that is, I haven't read the paper, I just know the texture looks great. I give the redstone go around the cylinder split instead of smoothing those normals, the original is smooth. No, the original is flat shaped. It's on purpose, right? It's supposed to look like a hexagonal nut, right? That's why I did it. I mean, the marbles before, definitely, they are not smooth. They look smooth here, but not here. What the fuck? No, they're not smooth. Although I do see the argument to make it smooth, because in the other artwork it is smooth, but also I think it looks a lot better not being smooth. Yeah, looking at modern artwork of them, you would think the top was supposed to be round. There is a little bit of like, it looks better flat shaded, but also like, had I smooth shaded it, people would have been like, yeah, but you smooth shaded them, you compromised on graphic quality, like obviously yours would run better. And I kinda don't want that either. What is he doing? Okay, I guess we can do it. Money. Pay me money. Holy shit, I got combo'd. They're definitely bugging out right now, but I'm not sure why. It's like as soon as Mario is nearby, they just lose their will to live. Wait, what's this about? Really? That sounds awful. I'll be honest, right? I made that up after the fact. Honestly, I gave Mario back the bob-omb and he's just like, I made it look better. And then it's like, okay, well, I need to make the video now. And that's like, yeah, this is what we're targeting. But really, we didn't. Really, it's just like my justification and post. Literally gambling. Thank you for the six bits. Literally gambling. Did you try making him out of half a sphere? Nope, I did not because his arms are connected, so that wouldn't work. Hydration check. Let's hydrate. Nah. Something about Action State 2 makes them lose their will to live. Uh... Oh, whoops, I forgot to comment. It would pay me more to not do it. They're like, not turning at all. Do you see that? They just stopped turning. When he got in. That's why. How much? Uh, three-phase boss fight? With all that? I'm expecting that's probably around 25 hours of work. I charged like $60 an hour, maybe? So... You're gonna have to pay me $1500. Actually, that's not even that bad. Even back then he was around at the top. Yeah, that was weird how he missed Mario. That looks dumb. He obviously shouldn't be missing Mario like that. Now I know why he died. I don't like this. That's a bad way of doing that. We need to use this. Now this actually respects the rich. Actually, let's move up here. I don't like having to extend this. That's my parameter page for the moon. There we go. Is he swirling? Maybe. I don't know. I'll let you guys talk to him. Who pinged me? What is this? Honestly, that would be a banger short. Maybe a little less offensive. Maybe a bit more in depth. I should make YouTube shorts again. They were so funny to have. Making sure I didn't actually export that. Wouldn't you get... No, actually no. You wouldn't get radioactive poisoning. You can just get the protons yourself, right? Isn't that just... Doesn't that happen if you do something special with a weapon? Sure, you can get protons. Yeah, you don't even need to get the atoms, man. You can just get the protons yourself. Dude, that looks so shit. Why does this happen? I have no idea what you just said. We're talking about Bob-omb and Bob-omb? I've heard Bob-omb so many times. There's many things like this where you do not notice a thing until someone points it out to you. I am 100% convinced that Bob-omb is a similar situation here. Hello, Semble. Or lightning. I think you even said lightning instead of lighting in the Bob-omb video. There's a good chance I did. For me, the difference between lightning and lighting for a long time was not quite clear. But obviously now I know. You almost said the correct way of Bob-omb. It's not Bom-omb. It's Bob-omb. It's Bob-omb! Is this texture? Is this texture? Hey! I cannot tell you anything about the work I do at Gears. I cannot even tell you whether we are working on it or not. I can't even give you a hint. Nothing at all. I hit one, and you come in right over it. That's not a safe assumption to make. I would just read over that. I'm not one to get flustered. I'm sure I picked up on the implication, but just ignored it. Why does he not move? What if we set this? Just see what happens. Oh yeah, I also got a new chair today. A gaming chair, I think. I gotta still check out how it works. I haven't put it together yet, but maybe we'll have ergonomics soon. Okay, so that works. That's a problem because it means the Vec3FApproachSmoothly function is not working. And there was even a comment on the function that said, I don't know what's wrong here. So clearly something here is not working. And looking at this, this looks fine to me. Unless this vector here is always zero. Why would this be a thing? Maybe this is the intention. Oh, well. Hello, SquishyStache. Don't worry, this is just an avatar. I am a Yoshi in real life. Hello, Keffa. You know what, let's try to capture that one frame that looks wrong on the blue block. Maybe if we actually have a slow frame of it, that can help us identify what's wrong. So it doesn't happen at 30 fps, it only happens at 60. So that's a problem with the interpolation for us. Okay. First bit should be zero, that's the issue. I don't know, you can't pay? Well, what do you want me to do? We're at an impasse. You want something, but you don't have the resources to get it out of me. There's Alt-Q to enable the NVIDIA experience. Thank you for the tip. Who are you, the fucking Skyrim loading screen? Let's not let Mario get abducted while he is in the damaged state. I think we might have to move last here. Where's the boo loft? In fact, if you did this in the Mario 64 engine, you would not be able to hear both sound effects. Because it sucks. Thinking about making a video about the Mario 64 sound engine. Did you know the Mario 64 sound engine can play Tetris? Not quite. But almost. Like something else? Bro, I'm not Jeffrey Epstein, calm down. I regret saying that, but that is what you're making it sound. I blame Kakiadef, he said illegal. Sounds like you need to start mowing some lawns, kid. Start getting them back. Just to check whether you're invulnerable doesn't work. Because sometimes you get thrown. Actually, even while Mario is thrown backwards. What the hell? Oh, it's because... Why is it? Why are they chasing Mario still? I don't know what that is. Hmm. Maybe we should instead make it so that once Mario gets thrown once, all of them go into a state where they stop chasing Mario. That's what we'll do. Let's see... Actually, let's put it to 50. Let's see... 25. And then... Like so. So that way, whenever Mario is in one throw action, they all remember, hey, Mario just got thrown. Let's lay off him for a bit. That should work now. Now they will stop chasing you for around a second. A thumbnail for a YouTube video costs around 5 bucks on Fiverr. So if you make 300 of those, we're in business. For other people, not for me. I care too much about my videos to get a $5 thumbnail. It's actually done. Already finished. And I'm ready to release it. I am just waiting for an opportunity to release it. The problem is, Nintendo hates stuff like that. When Doriel did their thing with Shotgun Mario, they got shut down. So I need to think of a way to package that without getting completely destroyed. I don't like that he was able to get off the thing. If anyone has ideas on how to package that, I was thinking something like, I turned Mario 64 into a first-person shooter. That could be a decent title-thumbnail approach. But I am not confident at all in that. That really does feel like flying close to the sun. Controlling the angle of your fall is definitely possible to add. Wouldn't even be difficult. But I think that takes away some of the Mario 64 soul. Now the question, why was he able to get off the floor? I don't quite see a way that would be possible right now. Oh, I know where. Right here. Right? Yep. I'm doing go-tos. I don't care. I can't get all my YouTube viewers to download my extension before they decide whether to click the video or not. Okay, that actually works pretty well. That go-tos cost memory and it's for static memory on C? What is static memory? All actors use the BVH? Making all actors use the BVH is a lot cheaper, because, I mean, actors are going to be dense in certain situations, so they will reuse the same catch lines over and over, which is great. Hello, Bengus. So I think we got the Boobla infestation down. I think it looks nice now, and it plays kinda nice. Oh, it doesn't actually look nice when they come back out. That looks terrible. I hate that. Never mind. Memory on the stack? No, it doesn't make stack memory. That's nonsense. If it did, that would be a compiler bug. But I know that the compiler I'm using doesn't have that bug. At least I've never seen that bug. Okay, is your stack memory ever leaked? Holy shit, that would be a terrible issue. Nah, I would want to make a video about that sample. I can definitely just release Dracos on the second channel, no problem. But I've made a whole fucking game. I want to get a video out of it. I think it works on Android, it's just that I personally do not care much about Android, and obviously I cannot fix the Android emulators, so there isn't much I can do realistically. Why are we popping in? It's zero here, but that's fine. Ah, I actually don't see the pop-in here in the code. That's weird. Do they even compile if you jump to a different function? Can the compiler handle something like that? That sounds a little crazy. There's a lot of wrong information about programming out there. Just remember the const conversation. Oh my god, remember the fucking Coding Jesus video about pirates all the time? And then there were like five other people that were like, this guy is actually stupid. That's the programming community, man. Every programmer thinks every other programmer is stupid. That's the world we live in. I only test Luna's Project 64. I know that right now on Aorus it does not work, which is a tragedy because Aorus is the most accurate emulator. Unfortunately, it is inaccurate in its accuracies, which means it cares enough about some things to crash, but it's not good enough that it can boot up like the N64 can. This is an N64 now. A better boot. I love that you have to turn the N64 off and then on again all the time. Nevermind, apparently I can't boot it on N64 right now either. I don't even get to the crash screen because my N64 won't turn on. Awesome. Yeah, it's an Aorus-only crash. I will let Mai sell your stuff on my shop if you do the- What? Why would I want your Etsy shop? What do I even have to sell? Do you want to sell my shrimp for me on your Etsy store? There's a little bit of Aorus on the vote left, mostly in modernist behavior, but we are attempting to go to 0% Nintendo code right now. Alright, show me your Etsy store. Let's take a look. This better be funny. Let's try minus 50 to see if- Honestly, it doesn't make any sense that they pop in like that. Oh, nevermind. That's nice. So it was just that they were too low. Okay, maybe my sense of coordinates is off a little bit. That's how you get the star. You think that's a fun star? To get the star you first need to open Pandora's box, otherwise the ghosts aren't going to be here. So there's a little bit of prerequisite to it. So I think it works. You have to open this box here. And that spawns all the ghosts, but we still need to program the box. I think it will work on Everdrive, yes. It currently does not, but that's due to a bug that I'm pretty sure I can fix. It's undefined behavior if you skip the initialization of the variable, however you can jump to another function. It's undefined behavior if you skip the initialization of the variable. Skipping the initialization of a variable is always undefined behavior. What's it got to do with the go-to? Got Mario Super Star on Etsy, let's duck this out. I can't find your star. Okay, so we have the booblers done, but still... Pandora's box that opens from here, text, booblers on animation. But palm trees are more fun? Well, this is after we save the area, so the fog is gone. Usually there's a lot more fog. But dead palm trees is a cool idea. How does a dead palm tree look like? Let's make one of those. I mean, that sounds like a compiler bug if that happens in C. If you're doing an assembly, sure. In C? No, it doesn't. No, a dust veil is a good idea. Let's give them a dust veil. You are correct. And a variable name. Let's make a dead palm tree. Let's make a dead palm tree. Let's make a dead palm tree. What would I have to talk about with cricks, I guess is the question. I cannot tell you how to connect any controller to Parallel Launcher, my own controller doesn't even work on it. The issue? Well, the issue is likely with my game not initializing something, so this is not something I would bother cricks with. Let's make a dead palm tree. Let's make a dead palm tree. Let's make a dead palm tree. Let's make a dead palm tree. Let's make a dead palm tree. Let's make a dead palm tree. Let's make a dead palm tree. Let's make a dead palm tree. Let's make a dead palm tree. So you want me to advertise your store that no one's buying anything from, so I can put my things on your store that no one's buying anything from, instead of $1500? Why would I want to put things on your store that no one's buying anything from? What's your value proposition here? These palm trees look cool as hell. Okay, I like the trail. I like the trail a lot. It's a cool trail. If you want to pay me in merch sales, you have to think about the profit margin. I think the profit margin is around 30%. So if instead of paying me $1500, you want to buy $4500 of merch from my store, I'm okay with that too. Hello, Meepa. You don't think you can pay the big famous YouTube guy that you want something from in exposure? Which way is he going? Okay, with that, part 3 is mostly done. We just need part 4 then to finish the first Dota world until the first Bowser level. Biobank is reworking this level right now, by the way. I think this is the cap switch. Don't worry about that, Biobank is reworking that level right now. Motivation is the wrong word. I don't work on motivation, I just have a goal in mind and then I work optimally towards that goal. So this is the next area to do. This is going to be a cool area. So that's the mirror from course 3, but the other side. Slight problem there. That's not solid for some reason. It is marked as ignore collision, so why that was solid is a mystery to me. Oh, I see, it's not solid because there literally is a big hole here. That makes sense that that's not solid. Yeah, Meepa is right. If you can make a habit out of working, that's the easiest way to get a lot of work done. Let's see, what do we have for part 4? We have that. Yep, we have that. Make the lighthouse play the Pirate Bay song by DoopMate, if that song is still only in the Pirate Bay. Okay, I can do that. The mirror in the Rainbow Cave is one way. You can see through the mirror from this side and look into the lava. We have that. The other light sources are the entrance, the exit and the one-way mirror to Rainbow Grotto. We do not have that. That's definitely something Biobank will do and not me though. But that will look very cool. There are other platforms you can only see by holding a glowing crystal. These lead to the star. Don't hold the crystal against big platforms, you have to drop the crystal to make the jump. Build them some shortcuts. Okay, that was the plan here. You would be holding a glowing crystal and that would make some platforms appear that are only solid while you're holding the crystal. How is this not the most obvious thing any child can figure out? Super Mario Star is back, yep. He's been here all stream. Oh my god, it's Lacrimosa. I love this song. This is the best Mozart song. The whole... What's the day? Dies Irae, Rex, something something and Lacrimosa. That's banger. Can you imagine if it was masked magnification glass? No, not quite. More like the Mario Galaxy thing. Are you supposed to live to work? Who's doing the supposing? I don't want to burn out. I don't even know what burnout is. Like what's even causing burnout? I think I need to know the answer to that first before I can verify the veracity of that statement. This guy is fucking annoying. He's been doing it for two streams. We need a mod in here. I think he has like 10 minutes of delay on the YouTube stream too. So that's why he's always replying so late to anything I say. Anyway, so we're gonna have these crystals and you pick the crystal up and that makes some platforms appear like in Mario Galaxy. The problem I see here is that the player might not make that connection easily. So the crystal must probably have like a big sphere of light around it. So we've got a platform here, here, here. Maybe we can make the first crystal be kind of next to the platform, so the platform is half visible. This is like Remosa, but an impact on title style is what it says. So I'm thinking first crystal here, second crystal on this and third crystal on that. And then we can just have cool looking platforms that are only solid with that thing. Click the shade gap. Yes, actually, that's a good comparison, I think. I mean, I don't know, man. There's some items that are $60 and some that are $250. Depends on which items you want. Is this an actual thing you're considering? What about this idea though? Very possible to do, especially since I have programmed Jiggle Physics for Mario's nose. But I'm not quite comfortable with that idea. Probably like $100 if you buy something for $45. I don't know, have they not taught you division and multiplication yet? This scene looks like dog shit, I'll be honest. This scene is before the Biobank rework, I haven't even really tried to make it look good. This is not supposed to be a humblebrag, I genuinely think this doesn't look very good yet. The scenes in the later levels are so much better. Well, in the levels, not even just the later levels. At any level in the game, it looks so much better than in the overworld. Look at the zoo, for example. Beautiful. What am I saying, it's gorgeous. Maybe I can find a level that doesn't crash. Yeah, I think these scenes look so much nicer. There's a little bit of a render bug right there with the green edge, but without that render bug this would look great. And then the way the wind blows through here. Oh my god, the moon, the way the clouds go in. Or the ship, do you see the teeth on the ship? How fucking cool is that? I love this level. Unlimited FPS is fast, by the way. Right, I forgot I broke doors. What is no floor during render? That means that there's an actor that spawned, but it didn't spawn above floor. Until a few days ago, I made it so that if there's no floor, it just doesn't render a shadow. Now I made it so that it crashes if there's no floor, so I can find all the missing floors. That's why quite a few levels crash right now, because there's a lot of objects that spawn above not floor. I'm sure you can get there. I am a fast learner, and I have the IQ to pick up most skills, but I have zero talent for art. What you see here right now is just someone who's learned it a lot, and not someone who has any skill for it naturally. I'm assuming you are an artsy person, so I'm assuming you can do something much better if you actually keep at it and try to make something good. That sounds like a good idea, but that's a lot of work to implement. I mean, it's possible. If you really want it 1000% polished, yeah, we should do that. Any Donkey Kong Country reference from a lore perspective of Donkey Kong Advance? No. I don't know that game with any references, unless it's an accident. What is art I've made wrong? I think programming is much closer to brick building or something than it is to making art. Talent is nonsense, it's just not taking it seriously enough. I don't know. I know people that are better at the art part of 3D modeling without taking it as seriously as I am. I don't think talent is nonsense. That seems made up. How long did it take you to learn a skill? It's a lot of time invested. I believe everyone has a learning curve, and the learning curve is different for everyone. And for some people, the learning curve is just so much faster, and that's what I call talent. I did. Do you play Melee? I used to play Melee. I was pretty fucking good at Melee. Do you have a plan for your future? Do I have a plan for my future? Yes, that is literally exactly what I mean. Are there ways to learn stuff faster? Does this mean one can learn talent? No. Of course, people learn to learn, and that makes you move along the curve faster. That's separate. Saying that there's just one curve, of course, is a simplification. Who's your main? Marv. I wanted to be a fox, but I do not have the hands for a fox. See, my demand of myself was that I was able to 100% perfectly execute every attack, and I figured with fox I'd never get there, so I was like, I need to play Marth, I can't play fox. Does your mindset help you learn faster? Does my mindset help me learn faster? Of course! Do you think learning to learn is part of learning to learn? Yes, that is part of learning to learn. That is one part, which is just being able to recognize patterns and be able to implement things practically faster. No, I'm very good at that part. What do you think about music? Think about music, for example. There's a crazy thing about Zena. She is able, for no reason at all, all 151 first Pokémon cries, you play one to her, she just knows which one it is. And this is the first 151 Pokémon where the cries all basically sound the same. That's like a talent for music. She didn't practice it, she just has that. And that's going to help her with music, for example. And I just do not have that. And I'm sure similar things like that exist for art as well. Do you think it will work in coding than also for art? Any proof of that? No. That would be a fun screen. Did you guys know that I used to be able to give you the numbers for all 151 Pokémon? Like, if you just asked me, I would just tell you which number it is. Where does this idea that talent doesn't exist come from? People like to just assert that, but why? Is it because we want to live in a world where everyone is capable of every task? Where everyone can reach their dreams? Is that it? Talent is a sort of construct? Oh yeah, just me with programming. Obviously I have a talent for programming. I was literally able to just program. I never had to learn it. Like, there was no learning curve. It just worked. Isn't that like... Like, you can't just say that someone moved along the learning curve faster in that sense. You can't just say talent doesn't exist there. You're saying talent completely disregards the time? There is a lot of people that look at someone being extremely good at something and then they say you're so talented at this. Which, yes, that is annoying. Because they are like implying, oh, you didn't actually work hard for this, you were just able to do this. Right? Obviously that's not what I am saying. But then you're having the wrong beef here. You're beefing with people that claim that people that are good at things didn't work hard on the things. You're not beefing with the idea that talent exists. I don't know. I don't know. The idea that talent exists. Being able to do anything is about wanting to do something that not only is up to your talent or your skill team instead of reaching for greater heights. So you are arguing against the existence of talent because you are worried that there are people that will say, well, it's just not within my talent, so I'm not even going to try to become the best that I can be at that thing. You're against the idea of talent because it can be used as a cop-out? I mean, that makes sense too, but that's also not beefing with the idea of talent, right? It's beefing with people doing cheap cop-outs. I'm going goodbye and I will get the item. You will get $4,500 worth of items from my shop? How are you going to do that? Please do not commit credit card fraud. Do you think speedrunning is talent or hard work or no life or both? Both. Most people can become decent at speedrunning with hard work, but then there's people like Green Suichi, I think that was his name, who's just so fucking good that even all the other hard-working people cannot catch up to him. He's probably worked hard and has a lot of talent for it. You're against the idea of talent because of eugenics? Yeah, but you can't reject an idea because you don't like the practical implications of that idea, right? That's also being irrational. I can't tell if this is a good crystal or a terrible crystal. What do you think? Did I do it decently or not? Well, that's the thing people say, right? Hard work beats talent if talent doesn't work out or something. How do you deal with the fact that you're trying to save someone's life? You know, making the game play better, program better, design better. I think that's a pretty healthy approach. There's only so much time I have. It's not like I use the time I gain from letting someone else help me with my work to jerk off in a corner. You get 300 items now? What? Guys, if this person actually buys 300 items off of my merch store, that would be crazy. I would actually have to program his fight then if he doesn't commit credit card fraud. Yeah, mindset is a completely different thing. See, with any skill I learn, I always start out with the mindset that I am an amazing person. People would love to be me. Of course, I can become the best at this. And I still think that for basically any task I try, but sometimes it just makes sense to give other people the task. It saves you time, they're better at it, why not? What? Sivir does have a state of 70% buff on survivability? That's crazy. Oh, it's not something I tell myself, it's something I actually just believe. I am crazy like that. Let's do this with Grit. Grit will signal me less alien than EQ. Ace motivation doesn't matter, I didn't think thus. Oh, I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about, but that sounds reasonable. I will not be big at an actual speed now. Let's do this. Do people actually think that? That's a crazy belief, if true. This crystal seems extremely small. I'm not sure what you're talking about, but that sounds reasonable. I will not be big at an actual speed now. Let's do this. Do people actually think that? That's a crazy belief, if true. Let's do this. Do people actually think that? That's a crazy belief, if true. Nice game, David. Mileage for the tip may vary, it works for me, but might not work for everyone. I forgot my exp at a level. Do people actually think that? That's a crazy belief, if true. Do people actually think that? That's a crazy belief, if true. It's true, we have been trading development time for hardware costs. This is just a cheaper way of development, I think. I mean, it's a simple, you know, pro vs. con decision. People in sports, but don't they think that? I never understood the mindset behind watching sports. Unless I'm betting on a sport, I don't see how I could ever give a shit about who wins a sport event. It's a little small, but it mostly works. Definitely need to give it a big shine, maybe scale it up by 1.5. Peace out. Alright fellas, I'm feeling pretty done for today. I'll probably stream again tomorrow, and we will start working on the secret crystal. And once we have the secret crystal done, the first overworld part will be mostly done. Or the first four parts, which is up until the first Bowser. After that, we are going to fix the crystal, the ice cap level. We're going to fix the first Bowser level. And then I'm going to try to get a beta test done for the first five levels. So we will get, for the first time, a proper insight on how our whole game design philosophy works for the overworld. And based on that, we might have to course correct. Or we get the, yep, this is amazing, do more of it. But yeah, until then, bye!
