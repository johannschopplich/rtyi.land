 And you imagine what I saw, and I was walking low and low And I'm on the street in a loony tongue, please promise you will trust me now Hello, Clemens A donkey dancing polka, a donkey dancing polka He smiled at me, I saw his teeth and legs were moving to the beat His tail was long, his body strong, and I began to dance along Never saw him after that, my polka-dancing donkey friend The polka-dancing donkey, the polka-dancing donkey Doke Dokeeee, the poke-poke-poke-poke The poke-poke-poke-poke, the poke-poke-poke-poke La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da La-la-la-la-la, da-da-da-da-da-da-da Go on and make me. Go on, pole dance, polka-dancing donkey La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Yes I'm dancing to the beat I'm dancing to the beat all the time Can you do Waluigi? Waluigi What? Oh, no, I cannot make a Waluigi mod Dude, Stray looks fun, I wanna play it too at some point The donkey dancing polka, the donkey dancing polka He smiled at me, I saw his teeth, his legs were moving To the beat, his hair was long, his body strong And I began to dance along This song is a bop, dude, I love this song The polka dancing donkey, the polka dancing donkey The polka dancing donkey La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da I finished the bomb camp off stream, and I wanna show you what I did Hey there, true first person Okay I think I picked the wrong file Little Kitty, Big City What am I gonna do using? Project 64, 1.6 You like the video? That's good I have a banger video planned for like two weeks or so And, yeah, I'm gonna do a bit of that And you're gonna love that video too This is before Biomex DreamWorks This is what we want Oh god, that looks weird We're doing good, good Can I bid a song request? What do you mean bid a song request? I cannot translate whatever that means I'm not playing Roblox again unless they pay me again Hello MarioLuigiSM64 Dude, I love this level This is gonna be one of the most banger levels of all time This is the music for this level If I do make this song, yes This is kinda like the 64DS minigame Yeah, the room looks similar I wasn't even thinking of that But you're right Right here is my favorite part of the level The siren is just so good I'm gonna do this Hello, Selton My best friend here on the group discord is the discord page I want you to join your YouTube channel There's a discord link in the description of my Twitch channel I don't know if it's there on YouTube But I do have a discord server Alright Since I already have the cap unlocked I need to just break the gate right away So I can get in So you can subscribe to Kaistr0m? Unfortunately not Yeah, if you just go to my channel You can find the discord Whatcha mean? Optimize anything Yeah, I'd advise you Hello Yoshi Party Okay, we're not working on a bomb camp today though We're working on the space level Chris15's theme is Space Arcade Ask the name what have you believe It's an arcade in space No, I'm not streaming Roblox again What the hell? Guys, I did it once Because they paid me to do it I'm not ever doing it again Unless they pay me again Why does everyone want Roblox streams? This is crazy I've never played Clash of Clans I wouldn't know how to get free games in that game So I think this level has insane potential But before we really get started on it We should lay out some groundwork Of what we actually want from this level Wait, where's the music? Oh, I disabled all background music I remember Because I was recording clips Oh, there's something wrong here There we go I really like the intro for the new bit Nice Okay Asteroid Arcade Before we really get to this We should think about the design goals of this level here So, design goals We definitely want Fun, freedom This is the through line And we need a way That you're going to feel like you're an adventure into space I feel like this can't really be An evolving adventure But rather it's a place That you are experiencing As an NPC basically Yeah, you're getting really annoyed, Zuglore You keep talking about Roblox I did one Roblox stream like 4 weeks ago How it's still relevant The inside of a spaceship or UFO or something The inside is going to be Like an arcade and you're going to be able to explore it Is it a lot of blinking Neonsense? Yeah But it's not a design goal I think The design goal here Should be like Put the player in awe Like experience Creativity and stuff like that So Evoke awe With visuals Slash lights How do we just put experience Dude, how is this song again? I need a different OST to pick Anyone got any preferences for an OST?

Just like a pure For Fun game. Silly Bing Bing Wahoo level. I think that could be a decent angle. It would be very Mario Galaxy 2-esque, just less linear. The Ice Castle, no the Ice Castle has some real world roleplay to it and some world building aspects. It's also fine if like two levels have a similar purpose. Yeah, I think the roleplay I think that's the angle. Let's think about that. How do we achieve that? Most important order of business, do not ever have the player question what to do. The player always needs to know the way forward I think. So, how? Certainty of goals, freedom in how to achieve those goals movement wise. Select multiple minor paths that can see each other and the full path so you never question what to do beyond picking freedom. I think that's good. Certainty of goals, so how to get the star needs to be outlined from the get go. Wait, planet gravity gonna take too long to implement? I already have planetary gravity implemented but I'm not gonna use that in this level here. Yes, there are gravity shenanigans here with low gravity. It's already planned. We're gonna have low gravity zones. That's gonna be great for platforming. But we're thinking in a more macro way right now on like how to achieve those goals. We want this to be the pure bing bing mahoo level I think. Is this a song request claimant? Or what is this? Is this the Glava level? Oh, I know this level. This is in Goomba's easter account. God, that looks so bad. What is this? Why is that? Actually, can you go from that wall maybe? Okay, well, it looks a little bad but I guess that makes sense that you can break it. Yeah. Do we want alien enemies here? I think we need some alien enemies. There's black holes that teleport here so we wouldn't want them to also be Goombas. Okay, certain new goals is gonna be difficult to achieve because we want this level to feel open but at the same time if you want to be certain of a goal it needs to be somewhat linear. How do we achieve that? No, design forcibly has to be linear. How do we make it feel open despite being linear? That's a challenge. I don't have an answer for that. Goombas with space elements, I mean that's an easy one. We would probably want Shy Guys. Can you do dive into? Sure, that is a cool idea. Not a sorry request but... Oh, this is also like an inspiration thing. Let's see, I don't think we can use them though. I like the floating water bubbles that you make. These are like good platforming mechanics. The more creative you can get with it the better. But we should also have like alien creatures. Wait. I'm a Goombas and he flies through space and he's like looking like the Mario 64 Manta Ray. I feel like I stole this from DanGPTV, did I not? This has to be stolen from Dan. Or not real. If the idea just now is not stolen then sure, we can use that. Okay, I think it's stolen. Yeah, he's already done exactly that. Nevermind, we can't do that. Oh yeah, we should have launched back in the 90s. Howdy! What is course 15? Space Arcade and we're right now designing it. We should have the galaxy red star power-up. We already have the wing cap but the wing cap is a great power-up for this level. So let's load that down. Wing cap here. I kind of want to prevent the main area from just being a hub with black holes. But at the same time we need to make it very clear to the player what to do. Maybe a better way of achieving this is kind of like how Galaxy does it, where every star kind of changes the level layout. And then you have like basically six different levels all with like dynamic platforms in the same level here. I don't want to do the red star if we already have the wing cap. The way it could work is if there's a low gravity area that it works like the red cap in the low gravity area. That's like the most I'm willing to do. But even then I don't know if I want that. I'm thinking about the ups and downs of actually just having this be six different levels depending on which act you join. It's going to make the Yoshi coins weird. 15 is the last main course, yes. Hmm. Yeah, I don't think it really works. It's like jarring. Expansion also departs. Well, the idea would be that there's a few static platforms that are always there and then what changes per act is the way you get there, like the planet or asteroid formations are different. Right, because you travel through space with the level, so I think it makes sense. Actually, it could be like a banger idea. Depending on which act you are like the path is completely different and you get into a different part. I kind of like that. The planet, I didn't make a planet demo, I made a planet boss fight and that is a boss fight that goes to 13. But not what we want here. Sounds very linear though, it is very linear. Although you get into through the level in like a different way every time depending on like which things show up. Just adding more memes. It's not gonna make the game better. Don't you wish that the devs in the 90s realized that the games would have been so much better on the N64? Shoutouts to Benji2e that literally just goes, oh, you like playing Benji2e? Fuck you. Go play Tetris or some shit. I don't usually give Mario level dependent layout. I have visuals here. Didn't see any well before the N64 version or it came with the N64 mods. My first week of programming C in my entire life, I made Mario 64 split screen multiplayer on the N64. C is a thing that you can literally just do, you don't need to learn it. If you have programmed an assembly before. What are you doing? I'm thinking! Progress on the demo, the demo basically done. I'm thinking I will release it shortly after Christmas, because if you release stuff around Christmas, Nintendo gets very angry. So probably like first of next year or something. And I will release it on the Case Clips channel, not on the main channel. Why are you stumbling around? Because I'm thinking. What do you want me to do? Do nothing. I gotta move around a little bit. I'm still thinking about. Do we do six layouts? If not, how do we make sure the player is certain of their goals? Fair enough, Unknown. It's for the Raphael Raven boss fight. That one uses planetary gravity in the original Yoshi's Island. So I translated that into 3D. Should we start with programming? I mean, the case way of doing it is to learn MIPS assembly and then to like learn C or something. But if you want to be like a useful programmer, C++ or something, I don't know. Okay, six arcade games doesn't solve anything. That doesn't help me design this level at all. We need a bigger macro overview of what we want to do. How do we get to the level? Get the pure Bing Bing Wahoo fun. I'm saying we need the certainty of goals. We need the player to know exactly where to go. No question about it. Then I'm thinking. We don't want the level to feel linear. So how do we do that? Well, it's difficult. Maybe it's impossible. When the player to have freedom in how to achieve those goals movement wise. So minor paths, wing cap and cloud cap. Sure, that works. That works all well. Especially if we only put like one or two cloud caps in the level, and then you have to use your free clouds wisely. Then some entrances, a sub level. Not sure it's going to be one, but it might be another six different layouts. Yeah, so the six different layouts would be like there would be a few static platforms here. And the way you get to the static platforms is different than every act. Because like maybe there's a UFO missing. So you can't make it so easily or something like that. And then at the end of the path, there would be a black hole that teleports you to a sub area. And that's the challenge for the star. Cosmic Mario pass. What is that? Cosmic Mario path. Like these walked away for you. Not everything I make runs on an N64, but this one does. Just make obvious landmark in the distance where the stars are. Also be aware of the beginning and the star description in the menu kind of hints where you should go. Maybe the boss fight map layout should depend on the second star. But you don't know that there's a boss fight. What if there is signs that point you in the direction? So let me look at this stuff I have entered here. Stars on top of the arcade. So there could be like a sign that just points in a direction and says arcade. And then one that points to like Whack-A-Mole. And then that's like the way to go. And one that points to the rhythm game. And that's the way to go. But then it's also linear paths. Except like some paths you have to walk twice. I haven't played Dark Souls 1. Mario Drive a UFO? No. Let's run the flipper pieces 8-bit pipe to Mario 64. That's the 8-bit pipe for this level. We're just gonna make Mario 64s. Hello there player Rono. I'm glad you liked it. I'm pretty sure this level run like will run easy 60 FPS on N64. We can do it real quick. While I'm still thinking anyway. How about guiding the players with coins? Doesn't really work. Because it's going to be difficult to guide the players with coins.   After 6. Yeah I'd say this level runs pretty well on N64 so far. Sillily stable 60. What if I turned on every enhancement possible? Still stable 60. That's just how powerful the engine is. Do you care much how the player collects the stars? Nope. Dark Souls doesn't seem like a game that I'll enjoy. It's like you just... The way I perceive it is you just learn the boss patterns. Which takes like maybe two or three tries. And then you just execute on your pre-made decisions. It's like learning how to work a factory job. Over and over. Why would you want to do that? I don't understand the problem with the hub and some pups need to assimilate your platform sections for each star. The problem with that is it's kind of lame. Also you can't really edge the player like that. What I mean by that is like... You can't put something out there and have the player anticipate what it is. Because if the player was anticipating what something is they would just go there. Edging the player is like important. Which we could do better with an act system. So I'm thinking maybe the secret sauce here is to make the level change proact. So we gotta build anticipation some more as well. I think that's the main issue with a linear level. I'm planning anyway the design of this level. We need the macro concept first. And then we go down to the micro and like figure out where to place what. And which ideas we can actually put in the level and which ones we can't. Yo, thank you for the five! Please open source your engine so you can get feedback testing on the game around the world and then use it for your game. Dollar profit. I am planning to open source it. The problem is if I open source it right now I'm going to open source it with my entire game. And I don't want to leak my entire game early before it's done. But it will be open source once it's finished. So don't worry about that. The whole map, the player will wonder how to get there. Hatching. You just need to get there to unlock the wing cap or some other space-spinning clap and fly to it. I mean this is the last level so you will most likely have the wing cap unlocked. So, eh, what are these cubes? It's a rocket ship. Kind of. Oh, the tiny cubes are the asteroids actually. It's going to be unlocked but you don't intend to place it anywhere in the level. Yeah, true. So, okay, well. I guess that can be one way of doing it. Yes, that is like a place that you can only fly to like afterwards. But having a wing cap here in the main area is the problem because you can't fly to the everything gets made trivial. Or like you can just do that six times and like get all the stars which obviously wouldn't be fun. So I think many people wouldn't do that. But then there's going to be a few people that will do it and that's not good. Hello devils. I am having fun making my game. I'm just thinking about how to insinuate this. Of course there will be a final buzzer level and a bunch of side levels. Is it devils or devils? I don't know. Oh, have you I don't know if I've ever shown you guys this the new f3dx free version is like awesome Never mind my ROM doesn't boot. I won't show you You didn't know me before oh interesting well right now we are making some design plans for the 15th course We already got a lot of assets for it done that you can see floating through space here in the backgrounds But the level is not currently designed yet, so we're thinking about how to make a current design for this level Using assets these assets weren't a scuttlebug hack, but they were made for this ROM hack The only reason I submitted the scuttlebug at all is because I knew I could Just like make part of my extra course 15 and like have it be a compact There's plenty of e-stacks in this game, yeah It's fine at all success should be just get you to connect a star plus the link it could be placed Somewhere in the map where it doesn't have to get the other stars. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, of course, I Mean the stars we have written down right this like the whack-a-mole game a rhythm game the skidball and the slides flipper pieces and Like doing a platforming gauntlet through the arcades Why when the game boots it's just happens with the summer crowd sometimes Interesting I am German, too I Would be very cool if you could go to the moon Somehow Surely nice German, whatever Oh  She's all the cannons of the moon it's gonna gonna be how a skidball works, but we can absolutely Have a black hole that leads to the moon and Then there's a big flat area with the moon I guess and you can do big jumps on it or something The entire moon could be low-gravity The problem with this is The layout panel reminds me of a flasked and baked rainbow roads Where there's just a circle in the middle and you go around the circle to the different challenges And no one complained that that's linear, but I am complaining that that's linear But I think was some kind of sugar break or whatever, but my body turned in an oven and you start sweating interesting I think you're gonna die I've already done that custom song maker. It's in a boss fight You thought my stomach was boring the last impact rainbow roots is It is unknown Odyssey rockets, I don't know what that is How's it going good we're just thinking sometimes we have these thinking streams During last impact times. We had like a free hour stream of looking at pictures of whales For similar reasons Green pipe on the moon like in Paper Mario where it's like a giant pipe in the background and you can get to it somehow That could be a moon base And you can see the base from here and then you get to there somehow What game would be on the moon Yeah, I'm gonna have to black holes We could turn one of these into like one of the moon games. We've got a whack-a-mole on the moon You Know what? I'm gonna do that Actually, no like a mole is bad on the moon because you have to jump and the moon is gonna be low gravity The Sun is pretty too, isn't it Lena? Oops. I didn't mean to put that on display Yes, the con count is global Oh Maybe like a mole is to the Sun in the moon Wake them all and sun the moon you can see it from the main area Moles are in moon craters Okay, so that's like a good piece of edging Where the player is like anticipating something they're gonna see the moon and they're like the hell is going on over there And it's like you see the moles moving from here You Well, the Sun is it to detection and the moon is a 3d object Our brains you have the role of brain worms Not my fault you think of dirty stuff whenever I say edging I Still need to somehow Solve the issue that you don't need to be certain but the level design can't be too linear. I Think that's like the major issue with like galaxy 1 and galaxy 2 right that they couldn't really solve. Let me look at beehive Yeah, let's see all stars I See how this works out See you came in have a good nap And see so they can achieve this by giving you like very clear cutscenes of what's happening Hello MN vid maker And now it's linear This is the level that feels the least linear the world of all of galaxy They achieve this by having open sections in between I See, I see I see I see So what they do here is they have a linear section and then in the linear section. They have like open-ended sections Where it's like kind of clear what you have to do, but you can go about it in the multitude of ways How do they handle the next one you just tell you where to go How can we tell the player where to go without having intro cutscenes Yeah, I don't want that and channel that would be too obviously just a bunch of linear channels and challenges that are not fun So This is all like nearly linear But they should you off to a different path entirely what if we shut the play off to different paths I Don't need to be an order. It just needs to be like obvious where to go I mean what the third stars just the first one again reading Nintendo what? This is actually what they do in Mario Galaxy It's like offensive I Yeah, I was thinking of using the wing up and the cloud capital enough Problem on the tower What This is actually what get actually wait, how many stars can I say off like 240? How many stars are there in Mario Galaxy They have to be 240, right And like the last 120 is posted Google says 120 120 120 plus 120 bonus stars That has to be right But everything says 120 Are you telling me there's just 20 levels and like half the stars and all are just like filler No way It's Crazy that games work like that and like 50% of the video is just purple coins Okay, well maybe I am holding my game to way too high of a standard, okay So how we can do this And It's It's linear what's in between the linear challenges open-ended sections exist Remember honey, honey, yeah, like series methods Excerpt for galaxy, so there's 20 galaxies in total right and there's like actually like 60 stars of contents I Really thought that was gonna be like 240 Sophie do this. We're gonna have to rocket ship. You're gonna spawn around the rocket ship around the rocket ship There's gonna be like the main stuff going on Branching from the rocket ship you can go like outwards and Most of that is going to be linear challenge With something open-ended in between I like to think of Matt's base And so I can mention to here where there's like so many different planets and you get shot in between the planets So like it's not very clear where you're gonna go next So maybe we need to add like a rocket or something that you can know I don't want to literally just steal so they could mention to this thing where you hold on to a rocket teleporters We could have teleporters that teleport Mario Teleporters that you bring you to another piece the level that may be Background or be in another area I Like calls black holes are gonna be there and tell them what is gonna be there it's gonna be both I Just don't want to have that many black holes in here So how I'm thinking of this is like this is the main area around the main area There's some platforming stuff and you can go on to different paths To go across the level Now the problem is six paths is a lot I Think the most we can get away with is like three paths and one entrance to the actual spaceship That's mostly fine and then there's two eight reds on the flippers the eight reds on the flippers I Have to pass here here here some random warp platforms here. I don't see how the flippers can fit Hello sile Cannon the promise Kansas that you can aim them, but we can do teleporters. I have a pretty good idea for it from 3d land world No, I was thinking like the fading warps and Mars 60 where I have a last name back teleport us that are pretty good I think I like them So you can see from the distance where it will take you the point is that you can't see where it will take you I Prefer that I don't want the player to know where it's taking them So We have these sections that like go completely wild and random maybe some will be like at the Can we have some at the bottom? No, they always have to teleport up But the initial has to go downwards then What's the problem with the marks expense because we must there's no problem and And Yes, the demo for return to uses islands, which is just course one keep in mind is definitely going to come out like By February 2025, I would say And everyone on the video is like so worried about Nintendo, I don't know why it's like so different to me And I think galaxy star thingies I prefer teleporters, I don't want them later know what it's going To Tesla max SpaceX rocket. I don't think so I Just don't really tell you where they will take you are the best way to get the player lost and break the immersion Everything is corrected No, you will be able to see the cannon You're gonna be like up here and you're gonna be able to see the big glowing thing here in the middle Mario expansion was being worked on very slowly, but it's being worked on Maybe I can show you real quick. What's the last thing I did? Must have worked on some kind of enemy in the slower here. I think I worked on the pipes here This enemy And The ring here, too Some of them are still missing animations I'm gonna put this to the RT by I engine as well. So that can work on n64. I think I Creating all the enemies from Benji Kazooie in the mark 64 engine, so that takes a little bit Yeah Okay, I'm going down teleporting going to a random place Going away somewhere else and then maybe you can see the rocket like in the far background from this other area I think that works The problem I have on that is actually like there's gonna be too much to render now that I think about it Unless it would be a completely different area and like a different part of space If it's a different area in a different part of space, how do we make the player know that? Maybe don't render the moon Maybe the Sun would be in a different position Maybe it would be daytime Something like that Hmm I still have the problem with it that it feels like too obvious where everything is going and galaxy It's someone didn't feel that obvious where everything is going. It didn't feel like you were Not actually interacting with the rest of the level. What if they were like multi-story things were like One time you're going the bottom path and want to be going to top path of like a similar geometry. I Think that's a good thing to do And geometry in where once you walk on top once On the sides once on the bottom or something like this You Imagine walking on top of the market as well as on the sides. Okay, also also also Some top-notch star and we walk into the arcades You need to be able to see the star through the window on alternate paths. That adds more edging to this, which is good. Manage a version of the level in the BG, yeah that would kinda be the idea, but I don't The skateboard with the cannon shot is great actually. The question is if this area is big enough for that. It could also be a completely separate area here, I think it has to be a completely separate area just because of how much space it takes. Skateball, slide shoot, use landmarks, what does that mean? Now I see the value of miniature areas that you can see from other parts, and I do wanna add that to some degree, as in maybe when you're far away you can see the sun at a different rotation, the moon smaller, maybe the rocket somewhere. But I think that doesn't really contribute much, I mean of course I contribute some of it in like connecting this whole space thing, but I mean space is big, right? This is slowly shaping into something. So all three paths, this would be inside, this would be one path, another path, another path. Yeah we still don't have space for the 8 reds or the 8 bit pipe. Sonic 3 movie no song, I don't know what that is. Make sudden recognisable things to create a sense of location. But that's what the big rocket kinda already does, and the moon and the sun. Uhhh, if there's other landmarks we can think of, sure. Yeah that would be idea B. That's what we do in levels like course 10. This song? Did you put in a song request? Oh wait no. I sure hope this plays for like 5 seconds before Shadow comes on screen and like grimy rock music plays. No, the rocket is also a platform that you walk on and you go into. The rocket is the air gate. I can't listen to this. Mid radio song vibes, yep. The flipper could be entirely below the rest of the stage. That could go hard. Wait a second. If we do that, the flipper is entirely below the rest of the stage and it shoots you back up into the main paths. That would connect everything so much. I think I like that a lot. It could bounce you around, shoot you up and make the flipper really dangerous. But I think that's fine. I think this is a great idea. It's going to add so much to the feeling free thing because like there's so much new movement stuff going on. The flipper star and all the flipper platforms are below the main course and shoot you up if you move around it. So the way I'm managing this. I don't know if you can see my mouse. Let me just. So we got a main area that's like at the site. And from there you can like climb maybe over here or you can climb over here and stuff like that. Right. So this is this is the main thing where you go. And then below this area and like this kind of block, we have to flip up pieces, which is like, you know, the. This these kind of pieces that shoot you up into the main area. So that's also where you collect the red coins. So at any point you can actually just jump down and collect the reds there. But you can also use that to shoot yourself back up into the main area. Less symmetrical looks different from all angles. You could almost use it like a compass. It is definitely not going to be symmetrical. Well, I mean, it might be symmetrical, but it's not going to be look the same from all angles. It's not going to be radially symmetrical. But no, that won't be necessary even. OK, so you have to flip up below. We have multiple ways to get everywhere. We have a very open approach to the reds. Everything's kind of collected via multiple paths now. Everything in the main area anyway. So I think that makes it a little feel a lot less linear. And then you also can go from there on the teleporters, which take you to other areas from where you can go further and further. Now, the only thing that's left for me is like what the actual end of the path will be. This will be the biggest level we have.  That's the biggest space wise. Just because when you have linear sections, that's just going to happen. Whack-a-mole is... And I feel similarly about the rhythm game idea. Skateball is great. I like Skateball a lot. Now the issue is just how do we make this feel more like an arcade with arcade games. I don't like good arcade games. We definitely can't make the player play air hockey. And also not stuff like that. This is AI. I'm not making Mario play Pac-Man. Although, dude, Pac-Man with Chain Chomps kind of would go hard. Not gonna lie.  Hmm. Exploding some rock outside was an idea we had. Didn't go very well. Basic memory control while using Mario means with Mario. We said earlier we want to avoid games where you are Mario, like pressing controller buttons. Just because that's not really fun. The idea was that Mario was going to be the gameplay figure in the games himself. So with Whack-a-mole it kind of works. I don't know if Whack-a-mole is any good though. Whack-a-mole is too similar to Monty Mole Boss Fight we already have, I think. And the rhythm game idea, I don't even know how that would work. I think both of these games are bad. A claw machine, if we could somehow make a claw machine work, that would be amazing. Pinball is already for the red coins. And it's not really a slide, it's just platforms that you can platform on. More like trampolines. With the claw machine, my biggest gripe is that the stuff that is inside is going to be really hard to work with. We can probably make it work. We could teleport the player into the claw machine and then you'd have to somehow climb to the top. That works. Maybe it can be a bit more arbitrary than a real claw machine. The problem is, if we make it arbitrary, the claw is at the top and the player doesn't look at the top. So they won't even know they're in the claw machine until the very end. Which kind of ruins the vibe. I can't just say, fuck you, you're not playing Pac-Man. You got your machine, you just gamble over and over until you win. And no. I don't know.     We don't want to do gambling, we want to do actually fun games to play. How are you going to play Air Hockey as Mario? I guess we could make the player kick the puck. It seems too jank. Hello Rexrath. Racing like on a Koopa shell. I think it has potential. I mean arcade cabinet, that's what it's called. What are we looking at? We're thinking of the two arcade machine stars in this course here. Or the stars in general. You guys want to see some funny shit? Turns out that's from a video game. This comic is going to get finished after all. This was like a whole computer work thing. Where should we go? Chicago? Detroit? Chess? Boston? New York? Miami? Los Angeles? Let's go to Chess. Sounds kind of grouch. We got those flags, we got the road closed. Right, I crashed the game like this. The radio is my favorite in this. Maybe we should just listen to the radio in this game. The whole game comes with like one hour and a half of radio. I think the game is going to be awesome when it's done. My favorite pride flag is the stop sign. Can I shoot homeless persons in LA? Maybe. You can definitely shoot pedestrians in this game, not just gang and police. Do we have any other ideas for games that I wrote down? I think I deleted all of that. Why do all arcade games suck? Shit. The best part about the OST in Mario Drag Race here is that there's ads in the radio and they're all like Mario joke ads. Hello, radio. We're currently looking into arcade games that we can adapt into Mario 64 in a fun way. And I want them to be controlled by Mario's movement. And I don't want Pac-Man. I have a lot of demands. This is all in the Romic, by the way. This is not me listening to a YouTube video. It's all Pac-Man. This would be an easy one to control with Mario, but is it fun? Is there a Tetris arcade machine? There's not. But that doesn't really seem like a good idea.      That would be fun for Mario. Well... We could make a Tetris arcade machine where you have to get to the top without getting crushed. I think that could work. You know, like the Pinball machine in Mario Sunshine? I know, notoriously popular, but like it could work. I think that's a good idea. I'm going to do Tetris. Let's do that. You have to survive until all pieces have fallen so you can reach the star at the top. Something like that. It's not going to be a properly programmed Tetris, because like the... If the holes disappear, like once you get to the top, and you got the hole closed, you would either get gay baby jailed or like... Maybe we can do it. We'll see. We'll see what we do. No, there's still like a mole, which I don't like. What's another game like that? Tic-Tac-Toe? This would be a funny one, but this would be miserable. Stand-Up-Model? Definitely not doing this one. We're not doing like games. I will not encourage children to gamble.    Family Guy Pinball? Interesting idea. I think not. Can we do something with playing cards? Fill the balloon with skirt guns sort of thing. I mean, yes, I want Carnival Prize games. But... It has to be ones that we can control with Mario. Maybe I should do Voltron along with other games. Let's go. The music. Send a blank check and make it go fish. I don't think playing go fish would be fun in a platformer. It's the problem. There's the Wii Carnival Games game. Mario Party? Oh, that's a good idea. I don't want to be spoiled on Mario Party Jamboree. Nathaniel Bandy. Let's go. Bumps Away? Is this a Carnival game? I'll just go now, so I don't like it. Hot Rope Jump? Of course, Hot Rope Jump. Of course in mario they would play mario party games in the arcades right that makes sense that's what they would do this can work for like a yoshi coin or something i'll note it down a drop jump is this just mario party 1 this is just mario party 1 right i thought you had taste bobsled run hexagon yeah hexagon is peak every mario party minigame ranked maybe we like go to the very end we'll find something decent pizza pizza what there's no way they're going through the list that fast i must have skipped the entire list somehow this list sucks and what's the best one on each game this is an interesting idea maybe this works as an arcade game could just rip the goat no no that's a terrible idea unknown that wouldn't be fun at all this would work really well for um some of the pixel arts that we have i mean don't you just hate old people who try to be trendy i mean isn't it just the saddest thing imaginable i'll give you a story about that after this hey jimmy wanna try something come on try it jimmy take a heat no mario mario says drugs are for losers so i admit wario would say yes to drugs don't become a stinky loser like him just say no to drugs but sometimes he's just not big enough that's why he drinks lots of milk it makes him grow even bigger than mushrooms do now bowser has no shot at sealing the princess so long a bowser go get yourself a bottle of moo moo meadow milk our cows are held in giant fields and they are being entertained 24 7 the happiest cows around wanna grow the calcium and milk helps your bones grow the fucking ads are so good it's like 12 ads and the drug was mario game and they're all great for electric pen is a japanese game that's kind of like an arcade even though it's based on a game show uh-huh back to nintendo xost none of these really feel like arcade games to me i mean except for hot rope jump what about like the single-player mini-games everybody is single-player mini-games surely they would feel more like it one player games there we go this is just mario party one is it not it is remembering my slot machine shell game oh of course shell game that's like a very obvious one let's get this pedal power wacker plants let's just like a more teaching to us knock block tower importance there's no single-player mini-games interesting so boss mini-games was that the base printing without physics and we don't want them to be  does only mario party one have single-player mini-games that's crazy if true what are some other like high schoolers maybe high schooler mini-games mario party maybe that's the right way what's this this is also very mario party-esque i don't know some of these that's hard to die there's like only win or fail my 60s mini-games let's look at that bingo ball okay definitely can't do that bomb bomb squads nope boom box i don't think so bounce and pounce nope or actually it's kind of fitting but not really coin centration actually now that i think about it we could have a large field of boxes and there's a star going into one of the boxes and then the boxes shuffle around and you have to find the box with the star in it by like ground pounding it and if you ground pound the wrong one you just die that's one way we could do an arcade game it loves me it's the peak video game oh toy box shuffle tux box shuffle ah yeah it's very similar to this it'd be like an exclamation box shuffle thing god i'm dreading to program that aragon oh i see memory i don't think we want to make the play of memory shu kobayashi so snake with an 8-bit wiggler we want to play to control mario and to beat the player the games with mario i think tetris really is the best one so far maybe pac-man is to play pac-man seems like the best one to make work and pac-man we can translate this into 3d we make it so that the player that there's like a field and the players to jump into it and the change rooms that are in the labyrinth are like really fast so you have to jump on top of thoughts to dodge them i think that has potential and i think i prefer that over the box shuffle i'm just worried about the camera a little bit maybe if i make the world slow enough it could work i will actually do that i think pac-mario pac-man but the worlds are kind of low so we open this gem up and then there's chain jumps in here like it's all the bugs to spawn a star it's not a puzzle game it's all just platforming and i think this works and this gives us the first four five stars in this level actually then now we know how to place the first five stars what i don't know yet is what to do with the 8-bit pipe one thing that i saw when we were doing this level is like that the 8-bit pipe could go in here but i don't really like that it's like too hidden the 8-bit pipe could also just be like hidden on a separate thing and you have to find like a warp to get there or you have to figure out something to get there hmm we could do biobank's idea with um we could turn one of the yoshi coins into the 8-bit pipe kid machine near gate sit down and be the dumbed down starfreak 64 that is definitely a yoshi coin hit the lights simon says the scam machine probably has to go she coins on rope jump is a really good one one two three four five six one two three four five six okay so this could be the 8-bit pipe there's still six in here so i think got that anything that's hidden then the red driver they got because it's also too hidden i guess yeah okay it won't be fine i think we actually have six yukon ideas here and i think the one that's obviously not good is simon's maybe simon says is fine we can turn any of these six into just a random thing you have to do to move forward so like this one here one two three four five there we go good so guys i think it would be fine yes hello enemies okay the enemies is something i'm not sure on yet so since this is yoshi's island i kind of want shy guys can we make like space shy guys the exists it's french there's a mario party eight okay so that's what space shy guys look like i don't know about this we might have to invent a new space shy guy what if he made space shy guys that are like really lanky like this long guys they would look pretty alien wouldn't they maybe they can do like a spin attack at you like when you do the spin in mario galaxy i think that'd be a neat reference  oktumba no i want shy guys this is kind of cool will there be friendly faces nope this is purely no text i think i'll also just like shoot something at you okay i'm definitely noting down space shy guys what else would live in space take monsters for sure so there's an enemy tier list this is perfect let's see definitely not him or him i think chakyas could work really well in space like a space variant of chakyas me if you put him in an astron helmet he will just it's just one big helmet is it not now we can try again together which arguably that would be funny maybe brown panda wants to break his helmet i don't know about it it doesn't have to be a mario 64 enemy we can just make up something shroobs oh i see does it like mario rpg i can say goodbye to you you are my world baby you can be the moment well we already have some space plunge for mario this year so i wouldn't want to do something that kind of goes against our galaxy like that we can try again together skeetas feel spacey i think skeetas would work well they're very crawly and creepy so we can maybe change their color a little bit and we could have a jump from planet to planet or something i don't think we use skeetas anywhere else you know what i'll do that space skeeters we can jump large yes aquarium helmet what's that oh it's kind of fitting but there's already space shy guys that was thinking and that is these guys here if it's already canon i don't think i want to go against it i don't think we need very many enemies because most of the enemies here will be mechanical stuff so i think what we have is good i think i've got a good idea for what the level should be like now and i think we can start actually working on this beyond just talking about it but to be honest i'm feeling a little done for today and i'm gonna say i will see you guys in the next stream whenever that will be i got a lot of work to do and i want to get to it so until then
