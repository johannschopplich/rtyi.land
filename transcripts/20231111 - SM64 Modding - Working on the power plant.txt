You you Hello We can't hear you big guy big guy are a little baby Any OS team wishes for today, so You Well, why is there a geotranslate rotate Hello by your back, I'm not a baby. All right Honestly, it's like what 11 more months until you stop being a baby Let me get to my ring right here spiral music. All right Let's listen to this OST You guys like my new haircut Zayn. I cut my hair. I don't like going to Barbas. It's so time inefficient Less than 10. Oh shit At a mouse p4 DD, how about I ping my discord that we are life Dude finding the link for your stream is way too difficult I like Long as maximum inefficient efficiency, I don't think so because it takes longer to get dry after a shower It's like the one issue with that I Must cut them. We like do you have long hair? Instead when you're agreeing with bio back Bus cut dude, I was gonna go for a bus cut, but Zayn I said no You guys want to see some really cool shit I did off stream I made these guys I Look how good they look Why do they turn like that they have to turn somehow these guys turn a little bit less sharp Oh Now there's different types of amps leader some turn fast others run slow Good me more six-pence bad game that runs on an n64. Of course I can Watch doesn't seem level for one of the future levels Anna Maybe like a nice level, but I don't think I wouldn't know specific We And of course shock you Damn biomech. How did you guess? I Modeled them the wrong way around What about an American Thanksgiving? Dude, mr. Common. I don't know if I talked about this before but isn't it fucked up that Around Christmastime you are visit by three different Fatman with white beard and red outfits Santa Claus the nickels and the Christmas man three of them and they all give you gifts But we constantly rotate when they move in a predefined pattern Hmm doable, but would that look better? Windows other two you don't know the other two I Think it's even more specific than that Santa Claus in my region and the Nicholas are very similar to Santa Claus. The Christmas man is Santa Claus, but Santa Claus is called I Think he's called Santa Claus in some places here and he has Someone who helps you he's called black Pete and it's a guy in black face that beats you up if you misbehave with a route Yeah, Nicholas leaves gifts in your shoes and you have to leave out candy for sources I Isn't that Krampus, let me look up Krampus Krampus No It's this guy Nicholas with black Peter And he beats you up with a route but he's not having his route anywhere It's literally just a guy in black face Whipping father. Yes, Holly we are but we are getting pretty close to finished You Germany is the most unworked European country. I don't think that's true I Germany is importing a lot of culture from America actually I Don't know if you saw that message, but there's stuff you said you'd import today. Oh shit. I forgot about that What was it I Feel like I vaguely remember what you're talking about Hmm. Oh, right. Oh This stuff way to paint me I Guess how you did it and ugly I Also recommend it's just a bunch of e-girls Lila You Okay, well considering we have to import a bunch of shit for biobank let's do that I guess we can't work on this cool thing for now Just close all this shit I Do need this one for later. All right, the biobank made a bunch of stuff for us that we need. Oh Damn that's interesting. Mr. That is a weird obsession to add I Okay, so this is the cell guy damn this file is so old It still had the hard corner path You know what I need to open to get up to step it back up my ass it's once Is it okay if I say I don't like this and I'd rather you reuse your new usual shy guy model, hmm But this is the cell guy he doesn't just he isn't just shy he also sells stuff Oh Shit hello, Sam. I did not expect you here And I think I even changed the model that would be funny Ah, he uses geo bone And Them I'm so glad that we got rid of to your bone And let me just make sure he looks fine How you change the animation I see This one with your bonus okay, so in Mario 64 you have animated bones and The old model exporter that Nintendo used had a bug where it would duplicate Animated bones and one of them would have a static rotation which would mean you read two animation datas and you generate two float matrices And you multiply together One of the your bone was to prevent that issue without actually probably fixing the back in the motor conversion But and g bone did fix it, but it was still at the cost of an extra matrix It's just that the matrix was static now. So the fix was shit So instead you should fix it properly To save on a whole matrix multiplication per actor Oh, okay, I like it I Don't like that part We also still need to do the Dory animation and everything all the actors in this model are fucked up animation wise because they still Use the old geo bones system Don't lay like I feel like you'd be the person Like you someone tells you good night and you'd be like dude if you want to go to sleep You should actually like light on and put the button. That's what you would do Don't rise one then blend or something. It's Mario's world world or something wildlife world Have a new model if you read the redo, I'm not sure I sent it. Oh Yeah, all of these well all of these need new animations and I think Xena was working on all the penguins Next we have to speed ring We need to finish like nine levels I think she looks a bit strange that is putting it very nicely I Mean no, you were sleeping over you were just there. I don't know why This is an interesting model Oh, that looks cool, yes, I like this I Don't know what the current speed ring behavior does We might as well also set the graph parameters while we do this actually no, I don't wanna I Yeah, okay, so this has a facing of all attached just take this out for now Work off. Oh, yeah, you're right. You shouldn't reuse that idea Oh Damn I'm sorry that happened to you Sam. That's like Oh, I need to actually get to the star Oh Blitzo and spongebob, I don't know. That's always Could be better this animation So See the thing is when we work on a new level or new optimizations, we often break a lot of old stuff So a lot of old levels are really broken right now Again Mario's shadow here is missing. It's an issue I Think doors only work one way Something's definitely weird with the particles there. What the hell? I Need to move Mario forward here real quick Sometimes we fix the box along the way but not all the time I was actually planning to do bug fixes from course one to the last course that we worked on And I stopped at course for at the moment Yes, they're supposed to run after you if they see you And neither had shock But at the end the bug fixes I Would like to do it at the end But I also need to do better testing every now and then so that we can find issues in the levels I Send like gameplay issues not box And did you miss nothing I was eating straight-up garlic. He just enjoys it. I think actually course four is the next thing to test But I need the animations finished from Zena first We need to finish the penguins mission so we can actually take the Arctic airplane And He's running a lot faster now I Think this works now But if I hate that garlic when use the seasoning and only liked it when was major part of it ish No, no those animations are done but all the penguins need animations neither and Dory like you saw what happened to Dory All right now we have access to the whole level Wow. All the animations in Clunar are very slow-floaty. Huh. Okay, so this is a new bug. That we need to fix. Wait, what the fuck is this? That's not a good name for a function. Oh well. Mario get floor class- Mario get to rain sound added. There was no floor. There was no floor? I see why there was no floor. I guess this happened during the level rework. You look floored. Nope, I'm all good. This was a very easy bug. We tried it last time during the rework and it was fine. Huh. I must have messed something up in between then. Yeah, it's easier to just store at full framerate instead of doing keyframes. Either way the bug should be fixed now. The warps are all too small right now because I had to change something about the warps. See, the warps in RTYI have multiple parameters to let me configure some camera settings on spawn. And because of that I had to override the size variable or something. Oh, I know what you did. I know what you did. I know why this is wrong. You weren't supposed to set the fog. Alright, next up the airplane. Okay, it has some new textures I think. Compared with mine. Okay, there's no stupid questions. Are you sure? Are you sure there's no stupid questions? That's probably the hardest I've ever disagreed with something. Oh, what the hell? Where did my propeller go? That is fair, Biomech. I cannot disagree with that. Okay, the propeller is broken. We need a new one. But this plane looks a lot better. There is an issue with sounds right now actually and I don't know why that is. It's a bit annoying. You really heard it in the last video. See, somehow it seems in the sound computation one actor can be so far away from the camera that it doesn't update its position to the camera. And when that happens it's just the sound plays as though it was like right on top of the camera. Now you know. We need a new propeller here. We can't just not have a propeller. Oh god. Wait, is this written at run time? Oh, there's a normal propeller and a run time propeller. So what does it normally look like? Yep, it's definitely doing the clank clank clanks. Dude, I have a new mouse. This is something I haven't noticed in a while and let me tell you a cautionary tale. So I was using this mouse for a long time, like 10 years or so. And I didn't realize anything was wrong with it because in my entire life I only had dog shit mice. And recently someone from my work, Ricky, told me, hey, you should look into getting a good mouse. I asked him, which one do you recommend? And now I have a different mouse. And this mouse has 40 milliseconds less input lag than my old mouse. Fucking 40 milliseconds? That is such a big difference. My mouse was the reason I was completely unable to play shooter games, why I sucked so bad at them. I bet I'm so much better now. I thought I just couldn't aim, but no, it's the fucking 40 milliseconds of input lag making my life impossible. Shit, I don't have the file. What's the mouse called? I have a G502 now. What did the propeller look like? Do we have to remake this? This is definitely not it. Let me see what I had before. Maybe we can just copy this. It was an RGBA-16 one. Okay, interesting. So it's probably a 32x32 like this. Something has too many colors to fit into the CI4 format. Wait, why is this an IA8? Can't this be an IA8? You get more detail when you use IA8, by the way. Am I fucking retarded? Okay, I think I saved it. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4. Let's see if it works. IA8 sucks. IA8's really good. Why do you want 16 different levels of gray? It sucks. IA8 is a texture format, Intensity 8. Define reference MattePenguinPlaneProColor. MattePenguinPlaneProColor. There we go, I think we saved it. What's a good format for 600x600 grayscale with maximum detail? Intensity 8, so IA8. Basically, the bigger the number at the end, the more detail you get per pixel. Lila, why would you want IA4 over IA8 in that situation? See, the advantage with IA4 on a 64x64 is you save 15 microseconds. But the downside is that your texture is heavily quantized, so you get only 16 different grayscales that are evenly spaced. The N64 does not have IA1. The lowest you can go is IA4, which gives you 3 bits for intensity. How many grayscale values with 32? 256. Lila said 255. Love that art. Oh, I forgot to clamp the texture. I didn't fuck up anything else, did I? Dude, this is so scuffed. There's a texture here that I don't know what it looks like. It's just bytes to me. And the only way we can recall this texture is by just overwriting the bytes with the previous bytes. That's it. The texture is just lost. Unless we put in the work to recreate it. What if something was too indexing? There is no CI2. CI4 and CI8 is the only ones here. Just use the stupid tool. Yeah, that would be a possibility. See, the thing is, the better an art, the more color-adeptness you can be. If you look at modern painters, they only can create around 80% of the color-adeptness that the old masters like Da Vinci could create. That's why he's a better artist. You can measure it. It's true. It is what it is. I didn't make the rules. The plane looks difficult to control. The plane is difficult to control. But the mission is very easy to pass. So this is one section where it's really easy to get through. But mastering it is difficult. What? How is the minigame scaffed? What's wrong with this? Huh? Explain. Did you change anything about the spiral back? Why are you guys hating on the minigame? I did it in 43 seconds. I had a whole minute. You sent me a new one? See, I planned out what's different about this. I guess I can just compare. That's easier. The springs aren't necessary. The air speed boost I thought was pretty good. Yeah! That's what I thought too. Oh, wait. I just... Okay, I see what I did wrong. You made this. Oh! Alright. You think this looks better? Is the combiner the same as what I'm wondering? The combiner is not the same. See, I set the combiner up in a way that I can use the primitive color to control the alpha of this. So that if the plane goes faster, there's a longer string. This is the one you sent. This one here. Yo, thank you for the donation. Do you think throwing the baby penguin off the cliff would be as common if the baby had a cuter, less grating sound? Is it all just the sound? Nah, people would do it regardless. I'm fairly sure. Oh, you also used an IA-8. Why not an IA-8? It's the age-old problem. You could just do this and get more accuracy. Let me just fix this section real quick. I thought I... IA-8 is the IA-8.  IA-8 has intensity. So you can use the value as the alpha or the color. Oh, that's the donation. Oh, I already thanked you. So now this will be the alpha value that's actually stored in the texture and it's also the color value. You can use it as either or. Yeah, it would be nice if a 64 displayed it correctly. Not well learned. I kind of agree. It's also mirrored. This is a bit of a weird texture, honestly. Okay, let's try this again.   I'm sure Biomech doesn't mind if I just change it a bit.  Yeah, I think this is a bit better. Which I think... It's not your texture. Oh. So this was just a Mario 64 texture? No wonder it was shit. And now I'm just also going to copy the combiner. I use prim, minus texture alpha, minus shmul primish. Shade color alpha the hell oh i see oh and you blurred the last vertex just oh this is what mine does what the fuck i don't i don't know if i understand a video apology for some of the levels damn it's still very impressive for the time but i'll have to say they're not fun to play yes that was the thing with lost impact see my mindset at the time was like i have an idea so now i have two options one implement it to be lazy i was like no i'm just not gonna be lazy i'm just gonna if i have an idea i will put it into game and that's it no negotiations and that ended up making a few things not very good hello my suck boy the answer is no oh i see the original was literally just a stripe that's why the same combiner doesn't work let me see what i have set up here where's the airplane dust i think we're to remake it now changing only a few aspects and buffers that would be a really good tech huh maybe i don't know what do you think should change though like they have a like list in mind what you don't like so this is such a weird setup i'm even referencing the airplane yeah i'm using i'm adding tick and the graph parameters to all the stuff at once once i actually bug fixed at all that would be a lot of work biomech very very much work so still i don't think it would be a very good tech this level's like um the candy level that are just so big and useless so oh yeah triple dump jive platforms definitely suck so okay so we do set the opacity here to control this so what do we want we want to generate a factor between zero and one then multiplies okay let's just do two psycho mods that's the only way this is gonna work without big changes not like this area is ever gonna be below 60 fps anyway  oh wait this needs to be touchable there we go and now i should be able to set the primitive color to control the tail kinda why is it not controlling the tail so the front is not set to one there's too much control what is this yo thank you for the five dollar donation i have a song request i didn't hear it in a long time okay wait let me shit how do i do the song request shit shit shit uh streamlabs god i get some requests so rarely let me just do this real quick oh god i need to log in first i need to give it permissions am i getting hacked recent events surely you're sure you're sure yes oh there it is here's your song request oh i know why so oh there we go so someone's running around in my house you want me to go and beat them up doctor who is in my house the vertical one has messed the movies is this supposed to be halved like so so it could be zena it could also be just a random person that just walked into the house i feel like zena was actually busy okay i should actually log out that might actually just be some fucking strange on my house be right back never mind it's zena and her brother that's why there's so many footsteps so that was a good super mario dr mario i feel like this is not what biobank had imagined especially not that part damn this looks like ass right some songs are getting every frame which ones do i figure out why this looks so ass right now i actually don't see it oh mario was sliding down oh i'll look out for it next time i'm there maybe the plane does something wrong maybe we don't check the texture correctly so that's right to me consequences of the previous system yeah that would kind of make sense at least hmm it doesn't really make sense though i don't think we touch the vertices directly just make sure that's true yeah i think it's something in here it's like it's ignoring texture one entirely yes it randomly checked hmm let me see what happens now this should make black stuff spawn so one thing that is sad about return to yoshi's island is that you can no longer instant pause exit but you can pause exit while moving instant pause exit had to be sacrificed so that bad players don't accidentally exit levels yeah why does it look fine now what changed why is it fine now dude it's a fast 64 bug it has to be so we'll do all of that at the end do you actually like this better by your back i feel like these need to be a bit thinner so so here it will be oh wait 0.5 minus prim it will be one now here it will be prim it would be one minus prim multiplied by 0.5 plus prim so that's halfway to prim from one that should be fine like become longer that's originally what it did but with the new texture it doesn't really work like that honestly i think i might just bring the old system back just because this actually works for me right now and it does the same thing i think i prefer this would that be a big loss i don't think so we'll save this but probably never come back to it i think that was a misunderstanding with how the system was built so see on these they become longer when they hit a ring just because that's how the combiner is set up and when i slow down down real quick it should become shorter so no they don't become shorter okay that's actually an underflow bug then i see so that was a bug good thing we found this there is a line now okay i can just change the shape and i think that's the right way to do it in that case we also need to change the geo add the collision or maybe not the heating just turned on oh my god i hope you guys can't hear that too much fucking heating is so loud i don't think i need to change the collision so we only hear it when you speak i guess that's not too bad so this is a comparison new versus old which one's what you like in game one entails a little too low oh i thought it was supposed to be halfway up so it was the same thing with the white lines but even then the white lines didn't look good so the right ones i think these are the new ones both of them so just one at random no we need both actually so oh there were four of them what my code's only referencing two of them how could that be four oh Oh well there's only two in the game so I guess it doesn't oh god finally heating turned off yeah I would say these look good very nice why do you guys say that this game is scuffed what's wrong about this minigame guys explain to me I mean yeah you can hit the glaciers but that's the thing that's what you have to dodge it just slows you down a bit like I still made it with 11 seconds you can almost beat this blind next is random rock let me just save this file here the barrier is very obvious with the fan area well it still doesn't have a color area so there is that we can look at the final area again but I think it is just to pop in from the no culling oh these formations look nice random rock is literally just one thing how can it just be one thing that doesn't make any sense the hell we're not randomized before there was only one oh but what was the other one called random rock there has to be more yeah there's specifically a rock spawner here oh with three enemies states huh what is going on did this break but no I clearly saw the little ice pieces are there multiple definitions of random rock okay but we all agreed that we saw multiple pieces there didn't we I'm just gonna go there real quick and check am I going insane how does this make any sense at all yeah I see ice pieces to the left and the right wait it's just the same piece over and over where the rocks this was broken I see this isn't even with fog I don't think yeah the rock does not fit I agree apparently there were four variations actually okay Lila do you like the fast 64 defender number one how do I actually make multiple animation frames here because every time I try this it doesn't work so I have this I set this to geo switch case geo switch tenant state parameter is one because that's the amount of switch options mesh override it's this one here oh wait with a mesh yeah let's see what it produces mesh object has no attribute bones lovely oh mesh override aspect okay armature can do that I don't know why it's called mesh override it's an armature override let's get that I did that could not find a switch option bone and armature it should be okay cool so we also need a switch option here and then on top of this option we need an other armature that goes up if that one's down a hundred coordinates I'm assuming this one also has to be down a hundred coordinates so attempt number three let's try again next one of signature read into multiple okay cool it's weighted to this which isn't all right and export it and now that exported why is there a geo translate rotate on my thing all right well I guess we export this offset and the geo translate rotate is still there cool how about we offset this it's gone what do you mean you have translation well I didn't want one but now I bet I have a different issue and that is that now I actually do have translation the lowest vertex here is minus 104 the lowest vertex here is at zero you see what I mean this plane is at zero but my vertex is at minus 104 so I have to move this up a hundred coordinates I have to move this up a hundred coordinates now it's at minus four check this one again one looks fine now yeah I just have to teleport it up under the units which option bone should be at zero no it's at a hundred now and it can't be at zero because if it's zero then blender is gonna delete the lower bone the other one of the bone should be at height zero yes but if I do that that is what I tried Leela but then an editor geo translate rotate node and if I do that without also moving the parent bone in front of it then blender just deletes the parent bone because the bone has a length of zero and blender doesn't like that just goes no yeah I hate switch options this isn't germa do I have germa vibes to you I had to mod Leela because she wanted to post a link hey that looks nice I think all right biobank we imported all your stuff we can go back to normal that was quick excursion do the bullies not hit me anymore I can just I might make a german version you probably will also have like a french version and a spanish version because biobank and rionno two people in r6 community are professionally educated game translators let me do portuguese I already said that rionno is doing the spanish version I'm never stopping this joke oh is there a plane scene mario flies the plane not personally but I did parallel launch translation and you love pro launcher Leela that's the worst job application I have ever heard so I actually have the sickest plan so what we're gonna do is we're gonna work on Return to Yoshi's Island and then half a year before Return to Yoshi's Island renounces or releases or maybe just a few months we are gonna announce our own game project our own IP and we're gonna make a kickstarter there and then when Return to Yoshi's Island launches we also launch the kickstarter for the own game and then I can hire a bunch of people I can hire like zero vault to make music maybe biobank if he wants to make levels maybe even a program or two it will be sick so we're gonna make the big bucks Return to Yoshi's Island you think it might be my biggest project ever it will be the advertisement it will be a pc game face toilet the game don't spoil it so so these platforms kind of look clean I like them so in my Portuguese translation just like parallel launcher no we're talking about the big release of Return to Leela's Island that's that's the thing I was working towards I think people will really like it so is it true you have to put other projects to make a big one you should make at the beginning when you learn game design you should just spam games just like make a thousand make a hundred ones spending two weeks on each get a bunch of feedback so the best part about making my own game is that I already know how to program an Unreal Engine it will be super super easy can literally do it as a side project but you've gotten done with Return to Yoshi's Island like maybe 75% Leela I'll be honest I do not care if you finish a match like or not it doesn't matter at all you are working on tools right now that is way more valuable there's already a million majacks anyway spice this up doing this instead ice cold that's not ice cold it's it's saying I just don't care if she does or not no pressure if anything that's a nice thing to say isn't it so the C++ shows whenever I can tell what's going on C++ is exactly like this okay now there is a new plugin we need to install in Blender and that is the mini n64 object exporter so are you in a new room or is this I'm in a completely new house this plugin lets us export object animations that we can then bake in code instead of bone animations it's object animations  oh that's a nice and concise name thank you for this damn this actually works pretty well I didn't expect to be so elaborate that's not what I want what the hell that's not even wait hosted right that shouldn't even be right so I wanted to export the whole animation why did it just import one frame we use this before come on no I used like the alpha build of this I am late mario wonder I'm not planning to play it in a long time so what did I do wrong miss Lila I think this is the wrong file this is the thing you sent me yes this is this is not the right thing I don't know but this is this is garbage this is not what I need so I always say English when someone asks me what I use  what the hell is this supposed to be wait do I need to do something else I need to do it like This would that work better nope it's still saying it's 90 degrees what the fuck need to animate the object i did look this is animated this is the whole amateur that is animated and i just now animated the object and i didn't export anything and it's not applying the parent matrix what do you mean it's not exporting any animation frames at all let me show this is the right file and i did it right here it is standing directly on the object now it still doesn't do anything hello logan green welcome to the chat and we had then yes indeed i don't want to export them one by one let me see if i can find the correct one that cozy says from oh no discord search is broken how do you fix this i'm trying to do from that cozy's what the hell what's going on here oh don't worry about a little baby boy streamer mode really really that's what it was what it definitely works on his end i think i think it's the new blender version that broke it i know it's the one you sent me i think it's the new blender version that broke it then why is it broken surely there's a reason it's broken dude the colors of this are so much nicer what did i do to blender all right have fun with burger maybe you're skillishing how do you see a button on this interface that i am not seeing there will not be a toaster in the mod now the hell i think this is just fucked what happened before and wrong and would export all the animation frames because we need all these frames here so not having them is a huge issue because now you can actually do this maybe we need to do something like this nope that's not an either in that case there's only one solution and that solution fucking sucks but i can do it did you do anything with her no i used this last time in the different blender version half a year ago actually a full year ago so it's probably just broken because i'm using it and how is it animated here is what I thought so we need to just export this animation and then get it from here creep attacks you didn't get notified unlucky well everyone involved truly unfortunate hello hacker you all right this now has the entire animation data that we needed no I we only needed this anyway I just wanted to get the tool working so that we could just use that it's that fortunately it was not meant to be so this is what we're gonna do this is just gonna copy the animation frame from this which means that the collision will rotate as well excuse me like 3.2 before it's not that big a deal I think just for safety I'm gonna add an extra frame of zero to this actually I think it should be within 58 and then 90 all right that should be our falling grape platform very simple behavior looks good now when I get on it it should take half a second that's the rotation axis other than that it works I don't know what I tried to use the that was obviously the wrong one oh that looks perfect and then come back up it is not coming back up and Jerry you can't actually go off the plane in that minigame so you don't have to pay that much attention to Mario and it's a very simple minigame you will only have to do it once so it is a pretty complicated minigame but it's also pretty easy so I don't think it's that bad it doesn't go up again oh because I set that to one instead of two obviously I don't think you're gonna fly the plane anymore than in just that one mission all right it should move one more frame forward and then it should be good oh yeah I like this now actually maybe even one more frame 61 and 60 and you get the plane idea I don't know I just make plane you should be lasers it's not like this is a super protected factory you're not you let's see if this is doable actually I might have to just rotate this 180 put it here this 180 put it here put this here that should make it easy enough hopefully if I did everything right I might have to move some of them down again yeah ideally these platforms will be further down or there would be a better way to climb them this feels easy enough to me but you can do the whole thing without even triggering a single platform I'll do it and do it all triggering all of them yeah I think this is easy enough the shake to indicate a motor for yes I think so they also still need a sound just wanted to make sure this works out fine for now before I move on I think one thing I don't like is how big this jump here is I definitely need to move this platform down and then there needs to be something here to step on like a box I'll leave the design of the box to you since you are probably gonna change that stuff anyway so we pushed it up against the wall so you don't fall behind it there should also be some here I guess I get this is the box place now I'm sure we can make some sense out of this their problems with walls fully covered with huge windows would be kind of cool to see the sunset light falling over just look and I miss texture structures in between yeah I definitely want this to look very pipey already have this place with pipes I want pipes everywhere let's have them shake a bit the chick one man it is there's also the bells of rich here that makes a sound oh god this is fucked  sound frames are at 22 to 21 43 55 it should now look pretty clean I'll make it pipe yeah nice I do have that art reference of like the power plants Okay, this is much easier already. Oh, that's so satisfying. I like this a lot. It should have a sound too. The checkerboard elevator sound. You're going a bit faster now, just a little bit more difficult. I think it's difficult enough. This is at the end of a long section. I think towards the end of a section, you should make things more easy, but also more exciting. I didn't hear the elevator sound. Why is there no elevator sound? Where did I put the checkerboard elevator sound? Huh? I put this on the Balsam Ridge, didn't I? No wonder there was no sound. It literally wasn't. The problem with having the camera be looking back at these is that that makes platforming suck balls. I like that. It shouldn't be moving through the balls after the cubes though. Remove the cubes here. Uh-oh, I can't be opening Unreal Engine on stream. Okay, few almost broke NDA. Saved. I accidentally clicked the VS Code button, which I'm not allowed to on stream. Hello Esther. Make your guns faster the faster I run so you can see them fall behind them. Oh. You know, we could do that. Like if you are on the platform and your forward valve is big enough, we could just instantly make them collapse. Let's see how that looks. So now if I'm on here and I'm slow, nothing happens. But if I'm hauling, they instantly collapse. That's kind of cool. Okay. They keep falling because I forgot to do that. You've eaten the bugs. That's what you're trying to say? No, Biobank had the idea to make it so that you have the chance to have a collapsing run behind you. Right, so it's still the same time it takes. But if we make Mario go fast and then you jump, they instantly collapse. Which looks very cool. It makes the section feel a lot more intense without actually making it more difficult. Yeah, we're kind of lying to the player, but it's for their own benefit. I think it works. Or do you want another section like that after this Biobank? I'm not sure if I understood you right. Is this course 11? Come on. This is difficult enough. It's not in this. It would feel cool to see. Yeah. It would. See, I was actually planning to use the platforms more here. So what if instead of a line, we just had a bunch of platforms like a ziplock. You just jump from platform to platform. Let's try the ziplock idea real quick. Oh, but this is the platform is going to fall into the floor this way. So it needs to be higher up at least. No, I don't want Alila and would make me make sense for some of the actors, but I would have to rework them again. Let's try this. You can mention an optic ID for a game world in general. Sure. Sure. That's fine right now. We are still thinking about the next four worlds. So game ideas are good to go. I'm not entirely settled on the next ideas. In fact, there are some ideas in the next four worlds that I'm not a fan of. What benefit would I give you? You could use world lighting and vertex colors at the same time. You have two different sources of color. Is it something like this that you're thinking of Biomech? I think I can move them all sliding down. It is a bit simple to just go forward here. But maybe there can be some incentive to go to different sides. I don't know what it would be though. Can we make every other platform missing? Let's make every other platform missing here. Something like this. And it does make some things look nicer, but it's not a gigantic difference, I think. I wouldn't quite call it a dream come true, but it is pretty nice. What about a new quest? Interconnected courses to make yourself a bit more authentic and feeling alive would be cool to unlock kind of shortcuts to other courses.  Well, Banjo-Tooie kind of needs it because Banjo-Tooie is so big. And I think it would be nice. I don't know how much we can do of that though. Then the overworld is still kind of completely up in the air. It'd be very cool to actually have connections like that. We'll have to think about how much we can do that, really. I think that's my verdict on that. I think this is good. I'm going to another course and being free to roam there and the best option is going to the course when you unlock the area. Oh, wait, wait, wait. You are thinking about the paintings. I thought what this generally meant was that in the overworld you would find shortcuts that lead to other places in the overworld and then you would end up like being right in front of a different course. This is in the third hub and we haven't really decided on it yet. Because I think having shortcuts in the overworld to other places in the overworld is really, really cool. I forgot to take into account that this is going to fall into that thing. Oh, that jump seems really difficult. Are these jumps too difficult? I feel like they are. I need to make this jump easier. Can't have a brain like this. I'm sorry difficulty fans. Because 11 it's too difficult. Clearly, I think it's pretty obvious. It is not. It is. You guys just don't realize because I'm so good at Mario. You're over solid ground. So it's just frustrating then. Why do you want to fail the player over solid ground? Especially in an area like this where arguably the camera kind of  makes the camera not suck. Well, it only sucks if you use it wrong. I can improve the camera a little bit though by doing this, I think. Yes, I just don't think difficulty is good. I don't want difficulty. I want excitement. You know what I mean? Type 1 if you know what I mean. Zero, no. Oh, you want the courses to be interconnected. I see. I think I prefer the courses being separate worlds. I think the overworld should be all connected and everything else should be like. Leo has been made to chill. He has been sedated. I think. Or 86,400 seconds. Who of you can tell me how many days that is? 86,400 seconds. Does anyone know? My shortcuts with the coins. Yeah. Yeah, exactly at my flare. That's the thing about it. That's why I want to make it easy. It's just supposed to be a cool set piece of like things falling. I think your level design should have purpose. You should move about in life of purpose and the purpose of this is to be a cool set piece. That looks cool to look at. Nothing else. Can you advise please? There will be wires all over the place here. All right, I'm just going to apply some UV mapping here. But then you add GeoNodes right on the video so you can get an idea on how the lighting will look. The lighting here is probably going to be very dynamic. For WOT of the week, Mario RPG Remake Spoilers. I'm fine with that. Eh, he still looks cool. I like him. I don't think it's that bad. Who are these notifications? Dude, why is my Twitter so active? Fucked up. Dude, I noticed recently I have 32,000 followers on Twitter. How? I don't think I've ever tweeted anything interesting on Twitter. Why do I have so many followers? It's like a seventh of my YouTube followers. I don't even care about Twitter. I use it to beta test YouTube thumbnails. I don't think I deserve my Twitter followers. But then again, I don't think anyone does. You can't hear me? Open your ears. It's the wrong button. Did y'all like my UV mapping trick? Cool, right? It's much better to share your content on YouTube. Wait, what? Are we ironic posting? The YouTube views started going down. The problem is that on Twitter, I just don't really get any money out of it. There's no point to Twitter fame because I can't convert it into money. I think having just one of those strums makes this a lot nicer to play. And then I move to stone with 50 coordinates. Oh, I see. I see what you mean now. Yeah. For advertising, I can kind of see it. Maybe I should start ramping up Twitter advertisement when the game gets closer to release. Have you played 4 Emblem series? I have played Path of Radiance. All right, there's just one room missing. And for this room, we don't even need to program anything. Actually, there's one more missing thing. And that is the belts that belong to these. You don't have these. You don't have these. They're supposed to have a belt like this. Hmm. Hmm. There is a problem to this. And that is this whole flickering thing here. Also, I'm going to work, by the way. What's the plan? Probably the amps will light up their surroundings. And then maybe we'll have some glowing panels and stuff. See these previous five days in advance by subbing to the channel. Oh, I didn't copy the emojis right. What's that star emoji, fire emoji, and 100 emoji? And let me pick a good preview here. What's this? It's not a good preview. Huh. What's a good preview to post? I'm doing exactly that now. How do you plan to do this code-wise? Let's just program it raw. It's not going to be difficult. Dude, I can't show you my recordings folder because there's a lot of NDA stuff on here. I can't show course one again. That would be like the 15th time in a row that I showed course one. No, that's someone else's voice on there. That's cringe. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. This one might be perfect. That's perfect, right? I'm posting this. All right, I've seen these previews early. I've seen these previews in advance by subbing to this channel. I can't link the YouTube channel, though, because that will deprioritize me in the Twitter algorithm. I'm gonna have to resume. You're floating regular my six with your engine for 64 hardware. Maybe I don't know if I can justify spending the time to do that. You know, that's the issue. What did I put it in a main tweet and that text with the link in a reply? Okay. Okay, we're doing it. We're doing the advertisement thing. Shit, which one is it? Nighttime Yoshi's Island something which is an in retro section rework. Why does this have 15 likes already? Who likes this shit? Oh, Yoshi's Island environment in one of the courses. Definitely would work. Yes. The question is which one is any of them interesting enough? Can you think of any I told you they love it? Yeah, true. True. What's your pain on a TF2? Never played it. It looks like overwatch without the porn. So what's the point joking? We have a castle. We can have like bozos borough, which is kind of a castle, but a castle would fit. Yeah. I just never really thought about making one. I think I don't know if a castle fits the third overworld because the third overworld is going to be all really weird levels. You sure about that? No. I'm not. Why? Why are you telling me that Lina? That's not my emoji combo. Biobank made that. I'm literally innocent. I'm just a bystander. Are you posted on Twitter? Yeah, that is true. Twitter did get me almost a million views on that. Do you have something? Click the link in the description and watch the subs roll in. Digital marketing. They're all unironically loving the tweet. Why are people so weird about wanting to quit Twitter? Like, why do you not just quit? Like, what's the deal with that? Why didn't you not just use it in moderation? Surely Twitter can't be addictive. There's literally nothing interesting on Twitter. Twitter has fights? Fights? What are you fighting on Twitter, dude? I've never seen people fight on Twitter. I don't think most people are on Twitter for the attention. Twitter is not really a good place to get attention unless you are like, a really good-looking woman posting revealing photos or you're famous already. Expose your evilness. That's what you use Twitter for. My evilness specifically or like, your evilness? I should fight you on Twitter. Oh, why? You really think you can fight me? Come on. Did I saw what you look like in my dream today? I know you have no shot at fighting me. Sauce, I saw you in a dream. Yeah, it's true. What do you think I look like? Okay, statistically speaking, you're probably five foot nine and a half, around 29 years old and weigh 195. Just pure statistics. What the hell? Attempting with that Geo? There needs to be this, where the thing slides in and out. And then the other thing has to be just like a piece of metal or something. I came to you in a dream. What did I do? I know you won't believe me when it's a dream after all. I remember the music, the scales, I want more. You saw the future in your dream and the future was my roommate. I guess God revealed to you only the most important information. Am I trained in JJ? No. If you want someone trained in BJJ, you need to talk to people that do porn. Actually, no, I know it stands for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. But I'm still not trained on that. Why would I want to be trained on that? Why don't you just like learn MMA at that point? People are like, oh, I do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It's so close to actual martial arts. Okay, why aren't you doing actual martial arts if that's what you care about? Yeah. Yeah, if I make these proper metal walls, I think this will look very good. I think I like it. The thing is, I need something for the metal pylon there to disappear into. It needs to look normal. We can still kill the Overdraw. I will still kill the Overdraw. Don't worry. Don't cry, baby girl. I'm never saying that to you again. I think that felt too cringe. You can't call people baby boy and it's funny, but you can't call people baby girl. That's just no. All right, guys, I think I'm done for today. My brain is over. Yep. I will see you guys next stream. Make sure to hit the subscribe button and the bell icon. We're doing digital marketing now. Bye bye. It's called Biomech. That's why the collision works. Well, and the pylon is an animation. Dude, I can't end my stream. I would like to end my stream, but the button is missing. This is awkward. I already said bye and the door is closed. Just all that for just all that for. Release me. Bye.
