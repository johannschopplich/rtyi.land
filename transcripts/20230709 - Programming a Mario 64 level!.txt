Hello. Hello, MetaDude. Yeah, it's way too warm for a shirt. I am basically just fucking dying right now. From all the heat. Hello, SheerHeadache. Hello, ExternalMight. I'm not naked, I'm just not wearing a shirt. So this is what we're working on today. Dude, I made so much progress while I was offline. You guys have no idea. There's so many changes. We're not gonna get the monetize, you're allowed to be shirtless. It's no big deal. Hello, Leela. How many exactly? How many what? Hello, Guy with a Russian name that I cannot pronounce because I don't even know how you're supposed to read the letters. I like the ziplines too. This summer is pretty rough. We've been to the beach the last day, twice the last week. Look, guys, guys, you will like this a lot. Look at that. Isn't that sick as fuck? We don't have an AC, we just have a ceiling fan. Oh my god, it's so pretty. It's so pretty. All right. What OST do we pick for today? When release date? I don't know. Nintendo will let me distribute this and I will just upload a patch and then we can play that. I'm gonna just pick Mario Party 3 OST. Hello, Jesus Toshi. What's wrong with the audio? Yeah, I added a little rainbow around it too. This is kind of stolen from Mario Sunshine. So today we're gonna, I think we're gonna finish programming this finally. We're gonna give Mario a butt print that appears when you do a ground pound here. And maybe something that appears when you dive. The audio of the star? You don't like the audio of the star? You got a bad idea? I thought the star audio was nice. It's supposed to be subtle. Okay. So I'm pretty sure Zayna sent me the butt print. Let me get that real quick. Here it is. This will be Mario's butt print. It's very loopy and annoying. Fair, yeah. Hello, Dimensio. Did I have to record, like, an instruction for a tech convention that I'm supposed to be speaking at this week? It's not a good day. It's so warm. I'm just sitting in my own swamp here. Can you get an MR6 for rawmaking? There is a bunch of documents that you can read that will have all the tutorials in it. They're linked on the SimpleFlips Discord server. There's also rawmaking.com, which probably has a lot of info for you. Please post a rawmaking resource document and pin it. How do I post what? Where do I pin it to? It doesn't even sound like a star anymore. Anymore? Are you implying it used to sound like anything? What is this for? This is for Bozo's oil rig. Bozo's oil rig. You post a comment here and pin it. I don't really care about pushing that document. I want to push my own channel. I want to get famous. I'm not going to advertise some random stuff. I think this needs to be an I8. Yeah. The missing Goomba? There is a Goomba missing. I'm still 50-50 on it. I'm thinking that maybe tomorrow I will announce an F3 actually happening. Now that I've recorded my thing for the Handmade Boston conference, I probably have time to do it. What is the best Mario character? Yoshi. The dirt patch? Nope, that's for when Mario ground pounds the cement. But like the comment answers those questions. Eh. What's AF3? AF3 is when you make the fangame convention. Vivian is? Bowser? I'm surprised to hear Vivian. Why Vivian? Why would you like Vivian? Money stats? I'm going to have probably like 180. Hey Lila, search Vivian on Google. Is it going to be inflation porn? It better not be. Vivian. Cool, cool Lila. Thank you for making me do that. Yeah, Vivian is from Paper Mario. She has a nice arc. Fair. Yeah, AF3 is basically so I get free content and other people get all the dead dehecks exposed to the public. Vivian Paper Mario? Nope. I know better than to do that. So this texture is 12 white, right? So how do we best cope with that? I think the other one was 6x6. No, it was 3x3. Oh boy. So I can just search for Mario characters and find inflation stuff instantly? Yeah, Bowser is especially bad for this. I have played TTYD and I think TTYD is pretty fun. Do I follow a strict coding style? No. My motto, my mantra is that if the compiler doesn't see a difference, I also don't see a difference. So code style is just not a thing for me. I think 113 is good here. It's not Baby's first program. Us is an undefined reference. Vivian is a man. Oh no, are we getting political? How the fuck is this an undefined reference? Are you kidding me? It's the exact same thing. I don't know. Gamer? What is up, Biobak? Vivian is a trans woman. They have it. Wait, what? This has to be here. And still, that doesn't explain why this is not working. Let me think about this. Why would this happen? Could it be that this is stored in the data segment or something? I don't know. See, the crazy thing is, I love discussing politics. I love being in stupid arguments. But every time we are in stupid arguments, everyone just leaves the stream. How long did it take to learn coding? I literally just looked at code and was able to program. I have never learned it. I was just born with it. You just have to learn how to deal with the compiler sometimes. Am I doing something wrong here, maybe? This works now, then there's no explanation for it. This works. What? That is a legitimate GCC bug. Fucked up Yoshi of the week. Those are a lot of fucked up Yoshis, but they are very fucked up. Dude, there has to be a bug in GCC or something. Why would it work now, but it didn't work before? You see what I mean? You have to learn to deal with that stuff. Dude, I'll be honest, I tested the game on N64 and while it runs super well when it runs, there's still a lot of crashes, like a lot of them. And I need to figure those out before we can release the game. And that's going to be quite difficult. Easy As Pie cursed me. I'm not sure if that's only been there since Easy As Pie has changed. If you give Wario an amiibo, he draws the character on the amiibo. Every drawing is MS Paint garbage, except for drawings of Wario himself, which are very sexy and rough. Oh, so that's a real thing? I have no idea. My text width is 127. I guess that makes sense. That does make sense. Dude, having a better N64 emulator that tells you why something crashes would be so useful. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay, now this should work for all even-numbered pixels, but not for the odd-numbered ones. Alright, let's make this work for the odd-numbered ones as well. J, J, J, J, J, J, J... No J. J, J, J, okay. Yeah, this is all. Let me real quick understand the difference between these two again. Plus one, plus nothing, okay. That's the difference. Alright, we should be fine now. This romhack is going to put case on the map for sure. I mean, I'm already kind of on the map, aren't I? You want more content from case clips? You want me to upload more clips? The thing is, the more clips I upload, the lower quality they have to be for me to actually have content to upload. Because having consistent good content like twice a week from stuff I make during the week is a lot of work. I mean, I only upload Saturdays and Sundays right now because those are the best days to upload. It's actually crazy that this channel here already has like 11,000 subs. I wonder if there's people like watching this right now or like watching my clips that don't even know about the main channel. YoshiTillionDoughnuts, oh my god, who are you? Are you in the SimpleHoops Discord? I have never seen you. There's only one guy I know that keeps saying blah blah blah Tillion something and that is Mr. Comet. Oh my god. Mr. Comet's out. He just said that as a joke. Damn. He's here for the first time and he's already predicting all the SimpleHoops Discord humor. Is there some sort of identifier we can use to make sure that this is only happening once? Nope. Oh, maybe action state? I don't know. Let's see if we can add a butt print to the cement now. Dude, maybe we should get one of those old school dubstep intros. You guys know what I mean? The intro someone will make you for like five bucks where it's just your name in like some template pre-made with dubstep music. What if I did that for an April Fool's video? It looks like using that identifier is just completely not worked. Let's just try this. I'm gonna be a 100 million- Dude, if I ever have a YouTube channel with 101 million subs, I'm just gonna- I don't know what I will do. What could I even do at that point? At that point, I've just played through the system, you know? I've beaten it. I'm done. Am I just saying 15 FPS? It's 15 FPS. If you think this is more than 15 FPS, your eyes are actually deceiving you. The reason this looks more like more than 15 FPS is because of my super high-tech smoothing strategy. I can actually make a game run at 4 FPS. It's gonna look like 20 with this. Very true story. Let's do this. Maybe adding the fucking dubstep intro from 2008 YouTube is worth a shot. I don't know who you are, but you are officially no longer on the YouTube Advisor Council. I am sorry to say it. Right now, I'm testing a code that makes stamps every second, every frame. And this is what the print looks like, so that's not good. Wait, YouTube has a For You page? I was not aware of that. It's a bit too big, that's all. No, the pixels are not rendering the way I want. So that is actually pretty, pretty bad for me. Not good news at all. Hmm. I must be getting the wrong pixels somehow. Hmm. Talking about the red arrows and the rectangle thumbnail for your next April Fools video. I think those don't work well on YouTube anymore. I actually think that's outdated now. Okay. So those two are writing to the exact same pixels. That's what we want. We're increasing that by one. That is also what we want. Wait, we're not getting the J here. That part was definitely missing. That's more like it. Getting the F0 bit first, and then the F bit. Okay, let's just test it again and see what happens. Could be freesync. No, we're not. No, you have to be kidding. We already have a YouTube outro. Hmm. Maybe that's also not appearing below Mario, but that's a pretty easy fix. We just have to offset it a little bit. Check Discord, that's very important. Lila sent me a video. Hahaha. Yes. Oh boy, this will be a banger when I release this in 2008. Oh boy. Okay. Alright, one of the axes is correct now, but the other one is even worse. That's progress, though. I also don't like that it looks like I'm just carrying this thing around. It doesn't look like it's actually multiplying the way it's supposed to. That very much sucks. Let me see which axis that is. I can actually just tell the axis from looking at the model. It's the X axis. Oh, that looks correct to me. Why do we cast it to a U8 at all? I think the U8 cast should be gone. Oh, it needs to be here, nevermind. Otherwise, this is going to be treated as a float. We can't end on floats. The motors being returned to the original island would be very cool. Nope. No motors. Dude, I still haven't figured out how to do this. How to reduce the delay on YouTube. That's the one thing holding YouTube streaming back for me right now. The fact that there's so much delay. Oh, it also shouldn't be I x 3. The texture's a lot bigger now. It's I x 12. I forgot to change this value here. Why no motors? Why motors? No one knows who they are except for you guys. And you guys are nerds. That's why you're watching me. If they weren't even good enough for Mario 64, why would they be good enough for my game? Oh? Alright, we got the ball here. The ball is just slightly off-center and it renders wrong on every other tile. And somehow it was wrong on the X and the Z thing. Oh, guys. Now that we have 46 people here, we can combine the creativity of everyone and chat. There is a new raw-making competition going on on SimpleFlips' YouTube channel and rawmaking.com or whatever. And the theme of the competition is Troll. Now the question is, how do you actually make a fun and creative troll hack? I think every fun and creative troll hack has already been made and there's nothing you can do. Do you guys have any idea that is actually decent and not just bad? Because almost every idea for troll is just... bad. My first idea was to just put Mario 64 code into chat GPT and to tell it to make it funny. And it just... It was very cringe. You know, that shift every time you die with enemies or with walls, you get them when they least expect it. And it's just...           Yeah, that just sounds miserable to play. Do you know what I mean? Hi, chat! Hello, Zayna. Say hello, Zayna. Hello. By dying and installing 6 copies of Garden of Benben on your PC? No. You've seen Cozy's idea? What's that Cozy's idea? There's no way that was Cozy's idea. I posted that first. I do exist, Koopa boy. I love... You do what? Well, I guess she's lying. Okay, now half the bad prints should not be showing up. But hopefully only the good ones show up. Well, I'm trying. I'm trying. It's going. Okay, so we know the top ones are bugged. Alright. Let's figure out why. Oh, I didn't know. That's kind of funny. How would I have known of that? What kind of competition was that even? Oh, guys. Are you ready for yet another unpopular case opinion? I have one to share. Okay, go. And... You can't pay people in money or exposure or anything. Then... Why the fuck would anyone enter? No, he pays you in money and exposure. SimpleFlipsCompetition actually pays really well. It needs some kind of price, you know. I can't pay an Exposure, I'm very famous, sure Lila. Yeah, exactly DM. That's fine as simple as this competition works, but there's so many other competitions where I just don't see why anyone would enter. I actually think it's kind of sad that so many Roammakers don't make hacks just for making hacks, they just make like stuff for competitions. However, I am way too warm and miserable. It's pretty hot, it's been pretty hot the last couple of days. Wait, I put the return here and then it was wrong, right? Wait, wait, let me... Wait a second, did I fuck up just now? Even I don't consider myself famous enough to do like a competition type thing. Oh, some of them are still Missy. What the hell? Dude, it's not multiplying these correctly. And these coordinates here are just wrong. Something about this is just not working out. I should be one of the main Roammakers to be playing on console. I mean, that's getting more common now with the decomp and everything. I knew I'm more of a master gamer, but given the time I want to make more RPG game. Of course, a 2D project will be easier. It's a lot cheaper to create assets for a 2D game. Okay. Yes. Why did I make a mistake here? You've played Zelda Hacks, 2 or 3 Zelda Hacks, have you? I played... I think I only played Dusk and Dawn, why? And... I mean, I made the Hesium East Dungeon and the Shifting Sand Land Dungeon. Yeah, and you made Missing. Yeah. What are you doing? Do you want me to give you the time in microseconds for that one, or...? Is the branch...? No, no, no. This is both writing to the same texture, but for some reason this part here is not getting the right texture coordinates, I think. But they are reading both from the exact same spot in the source texture, right? Like if I... Come on, dammit. I mean, yeah. If I highlight this, you can see it's the same twice. So are they writing to the wrong destination? The destination is the same too, isn't it? It's supposed to be the same as the second line above. And it's the same as the first line. Yeah, it's supposed to be the same as the first line. So that is odd. I have heard of Render96, yes. But it is not something I personally care about. I mean, this should be the exact same code. I think this would even compile the same. Oops. Probably a big scallop arc. Or a big bat. That's all Mario 64 bosses are. Just like a normal boss, but bigger. I don't know. You can just see that half of these are just wrong. And I don't know why. It's actually devastating. Hey, that's going to die. Why? No, it's definitely a big scallop arc or a big bat. No... No argument about it. You would beat the big scallop arc by jumping on it three times. Oh, no. Actually, making the scallop arc bigger... ...makes it a lot more obvious than huge parts of its body are just like sticks and billboards. So maybe it would be the bad. I was going to say a big eyeball for one second, but then I realized that literally already is a boss. In a stage with three boss fights. Cement actually looks like a big eyeball. It looks like sand. We can still change the texture. It's very easy to change that. We just need to make the code work first. Didn't think I'd be spending that much time on it today. Because I thought the system already worked. There's no way there's aliasing sketch elements going on here, is there? No, this is the exact same number. Big Busan had three Big Boos. Three of them. And one giant eyeball. There were four boss fights in that stage. Wait. This part is missing. Oh my god. That part was missing everywhere. No wonder this didn't work. The footprints in cement are like one fifth of the star. There's one star where you piss off all the workers here. By messing with their buildings. The fighting styles here are kind of weird, aren't they? Alright, we need to put this back to only bring when you ground pound. So that we can actually see what's going on. I'll just count it down like this. Oh shit. That doesn't work. Can't use opacity. I don't want to use enum state either. This is fine. It's like a fine part, I like the sounds. Yeah. No, I'm definitely fine with changing the texture. So we have our footsteps and ground pound. The ground pound didn't do anything. I also just realized that because we did this wrong, the other thing is going to be wrong as well. Because we copied from there. The texture with half needs to appear like twice per line of code. Here and here and here. And here and here and here. I think that's also the issue that we don't actually ever enter this action state when we're on the ground. Something like that. Which would be very weird. Wait. Oh. Not so wrong here. Huh. You thought it was sand? No, it does not look like sand, you're right. Okay, so sometimes it's the perfect circle. And sometimes it's this. It should be a 50-50 chance. But sometimes it works perfectly, which is good. Now the other thing we need to test is that it actually gets darker as we do it more. And never brighter. Yeah, that doesn't happen either. Actually, it would be fine if it got brighter sometimes. That wouldn't be a big deal. Now that I think about it, it kind of makes sense. It should be more chunky grainy. Alright, fine. Let's get a new cement texture real quick. I mean, the texture I used was actually called sand, so. Which one of these actually looks like cement to you guys? I don't know. Let me look at cement. Wet cement. This one maybe? Oh god, that's too high res. Wait, let me close this actually. Is this maybe cement blocking? Is that what you guys imagine cement looks like? Maybe a bit grayer? It's a bit too dark for my taste. Maybe this one?         This one? No, that's too grainy. Looks like muddy water. There's only so much we can do on the N64 resolutions. Now it's dirt. Is this wet cement? It needs to be gray. The light in this is red, so that's going to be difficult. The only way to get it to be grayer is to paint it bluish. I don't know.           Brushing late cement texture. I mean, I can look at this and google cement, but we're not going to get an actual good texture. Oh, I see. Yeah, this isn't going to work ever. But let's try it. Might actually not be so bad. We'll have to brighten it though. Yeah, kind of like it. Let's try cement, not fresh land. It looks bad enough in my opinion. Hello, some guy. Oh god, now our layout on top looks really weird. And you can barely see the footsteps. That kind of sucks. I'd like it better if you could see these better.  Yeah, I'm making the footprints darker right now. It really sucks that there's so much delay. Oh, there we go. That looks nice. I just have to make sure that all of them actually look fine now, because every other footprint looks like this. Yeah. Like half of them just look bad and the other half looks good. That's what I don't like about this. What was that? A sub? I still don't know if that's a paid sub or a YouTube sub. Someone will have to tell me one day. Still making footprints, yep. Yeah, I know that some of them are wrong. Just to be sure, the exact same thing happens if I wait. Wait, I don't need to think about that. Plus J, plus J makes sense, because we only go by 2 pixels per byte. No that's not it, some guy. It's because we are using an I4 texture, an I4 texture has 2 pixels per byte, so sometimes when we ground count, we're gonna be at like an odd number of pixels away, so we have to add 2 different bytes instead of the same byte twice. So there's 2 different types of codes that are running, one for odd numbers and one for even numbers. And the code for even numbers is malfunctioning right now, which is weird, because the one for odd numbers should be a lot harder to do. Oh wait a second. That's why, I had the numbers to surround. Now it should always work. Now our wet cement should be done. Fuck, it's still not there. But I'm pretty sure that the issue I pointed out is the actual issue here. There's probably just more to it. So the upper bit is the 0 and the lower bit is the 1, then we go to Y, makes sense. Hmm, hello Voisel. Yes, making content takes a while, you can't expect me to just like shit out a stage like that. You have to be patient and actually just let me program, just like, I don't know what you're expecting. Your plugins should display this just fine, they are a very simple render technique. Oh, no, you can't sub on YouTube. I don't have Twitch notifications on anymore because I'm not on Twitch. Why are both of these ending with 0x00? Wait, did I forget to change this number here? Okay, the same mistake must be here then too. Yeah, that might have been it. A cheapskate, you're not gonna sub on YouTube, fair. Is it more expensive on YouTube? Yeah, everyone's got their own preference for which website I should be streaming on, it makes sense. All right, it looks good. We can't properly annoy the guy now. And I think diving like this should just make everything dirty. Twitch is not restrictive, Twitch is just spamming so many ads that I just can't deal with it anymore. Stomach slides, that seems good to me. Slide, kick, slide, butt, slide, air, butt, wall slide, stomach slide, where's the dive slide? Actually, it would be stomach slide, wouldn't it? Ah, that did nothing. Man. Oh yeah, I also was finally able to get the romec properly beta tested, so from that I made a lot of adjustments to the game. Way too much effort into the cement. Do you want me to rush the game? Do you want me to just settle for something that is worse than what I want on purpose? There we go, whee! I'm gonna ruin this guy's cement. I don't even know how you do emojis on YouTube. Besides, we might be able to reuse code like that in other areas, so there's no disadvantage in actually making sure it works fine. We don't need to save this anywhere. Alright, so we got the cement pit, next we need a guy standing here that gets upset. I think we said it was gonna be a koopa? I also fixed so many bugs in the first few stages. I actually found a few more performance- Dude, I accidentally made a state-of-the-art programming code, I think. That's what people have told me. Look at my SIG A10s2S code. I think I might make a video just about this, just because of how cool and optimized this is. Look at this. Someone sent- Like, I shared this on a Discord and they sent me a paper, like, oh have you looked at this? And then they looked at the paper and they were like, oh wait, you did the same thing. Which is like, this part, basically. Very happy with this one. Oh, does this get the A10 of Z divided by X of, like, two angles? Or- Well, that's not an accurate description. It basically just helps to get the angle, if you give it two directions. But if you give it the value 1,1, then it will tell you, oh, that's 45 degrees. I've also been planning for our overworld remake a little bit. I've had some arguments with Biobak and Discord DMs about how to best do this. And I think we've come to a pretty good agreement. So most likely what's going to happen is that there's going to be coins you collect and you store them globally, right? And then in the store, you'll be able to buy different stuff. You'll be able to buy, like, a power star. Not like a star star, like a power star power thing that will make it so that it's really easy to get a star. This will be, like, a thing for, like, bad players. There will be the option to donate to characters in the overworld so that you can make the overworld progress. You can see the overworld change while you play, which I think would be really cool. And probably a Yoshi coin right now in the overworld as well. Hello, DevPZ. Okay, we haven't decided on anyone yet. We're probably just going to put a Koopa with a building helmet here. Oh wait, Koopa with cough. We have a whole stage full of Koopas. All right, let's turn him into our builder dude. Yeah, we literally have a stage called Koopa with cough and I just didn't think of that. But I'm going pretty well. What's happened to his shell? Wait, there is already Koopas with helmets. They're called Hammer Bros. No, I want the Koopa with, like, a builder helmet. With a helmet like this. Oh my god, he looks fucked up. He's not having a good time. Also, you had physics slips and I'm glad you got the texture mapping fixed. That was a fast 64 bug. I take absolutely no... ...shit for that one. ... Head me to the game as a Koopa. Okay dude, this is you, right here. There you go. I hope you're heavy. ... Fuck. ... Dude, we still need a third comedy club in the last overworld. Please, Kace, that was my birthday just last year, please. It's all I want. Can you make the Koopas dance? Oh wait, no, this is the worker Koopas. Yeah, he doesn't need to dance. The Koopas in-game already have a dance. You can remake it if you want. I could remake it. But there isn't really much you can do with it, because it's a super limited rig. Another sub! I still don't know whether those are paid subs or not. So I have no idea how to react to that. ... ... I also sent you all of Wario's animations. Nice, nice. Including a funny little walk cycle. Perfect. Amusing game as a coin? Alright, you are that one coin in the first overworld. And the first level that's given to you by one of the birds. Right behind the start. Okay, this is not legal advice. But if you're gonna give money to me, then yes, you should rob a bank. Why are his eyes like this? ... I think it was fine with the sunglasses, but not like this. What are you, an RTYI? You are Dakala. Lila. Not the tab I wanted. ... ... ... ... ...  ... And it looks terrible. I hate this. Let's see if this has a better eye texture. Well, it can't be worse than what I have, so... Oh no, what happened to his eyes? Yeah, that is the issue. I know this looks fucked up, but this is easy to fix. Let me pull up the- oh shit, I closed the model. I gotta pull up the Koopa model as a reference. This is him, that's him. Oh shit, there's actually a CIA, that's perfect. All right. There we go. Now the eyes. He's a cyclops. Isn't there a cat image with this expression? Something like that, yeah. I swear I've seen a cat that looks exactly like this. This just doesn't look good. I'm trying to do this, but it's just not working. I think it's because it's like the new school design and I'm trying to use the old school design. Eyes are difficult, guys. God damn it. I mean, to be fair, this is what the original N64 model looks like. What? You mean that model? Not really. I feel like they need to look like a little tired and overworked. I'm just gonna make you a new texture. Yeah, having him look tired and overworked would look pretty good. Give me a sec, I can make this in like under 10 minutes. All right, I'll give him the hat then. I'm just gonna give you a small 64x64 texture. It should be 32x64. Oh, it's playing a bunch of Mario Party jingles now, yes. Okay, let's use this as a reference for his hat. Let me skip that intro, please. Let me try the Grimace Shake. I don't wanna go to McDonald's. Guys, the memes are also just marketing. The whole reason that the Grimace Shake memes are going on is because it's a psyop. It's all marketing, don't fall for it. They want you to buy it and make those stupid TikToks, guys. Oh, no, the Grimace Shake. I don't know if I wanna try that. Diabetes in a cup. Wake up, there's enough of psyop, yep. Is that even a conspiracy theory at this point? Isn't that literally what they try to do? To make it, like, their stuff into meme statues so people buy it? I thought that was just common knowledge. Is this just the evolution of the Wendy clapback? The fact that we're now seeing company memes? I think this is a good construction hat. Construction helmet, maybe, instead of hat. Oh, okay, it looks a bit different. Oh, I like that. I have never wore construction in my life. I don't know what these are supposed to look like. That kind of works. So they have a logo at the front, like a Bowser logo? They definitely need a Bowser logo. The eyes are gonna change, Charlie, don't worry. I think sometimes they make stuff a bit too low poly. Yeah, maybe. Although this whole thing is 328 triangles, so... I don't think we can really afford much more polys here. I actually thought I was one of the people that have less of a problem of making things too low poly. Because I kind of know, like, my limitations. Compared to basically everyone else. This one is ovular, what do you mean? Look at that. Didn't say it was the case here. Yeah, still, I don't know. I mean, I don't doubt that sometimes that happens. But I think it just so often happens that I make it too high poly. Maybe I make it higher poly a little bit less often. I don't know, it's a pretty tough balancing act. Oh man, this is the first guy that shows up when you google it structured helmet. Poor guy. Funny, I mean, obviously you should always aim to have the perfect polygon count for your things. But, you know, that's kind of hard to estimate. Okay, I want this to be a Bowser-themed construction helmet. Let's think of a design for how Bowser would have it. How would Bowser wear a helmet? He had one in Mario Strikers Charge, didn't he? No, he didn't. Bowser Jr. kind of had one. You still have to keep in mind, Layla, that we're gonna try and do multiplayer. It's a Bowser. Is there any... oh, he wore a hat once. Yeah, what if we just take like a normal construction helmet and we add like a Bowser logo at the front and that's it. It's just Bowser's logo. This might actually already work as a texture. So, that's an example like this, but with shadows. So, what if I make a Romic just on a hex editor? So, I'm actually gonna use vertex colors here, so I can bake a bit of lighting on this. So,  hey, I like the helmet. Fine. Fine. Well, I wouldn't be right if I wanted to push a color, but I get what you mean. I know what you want. Well, actually, that's not even... What you want wouldn't have any color. It would just be this. This is the most we can do with your idea. So, Mr. Resolution, you think we should be... I mean, we can be low rs. Maybe it makes sense to be low rs. I'm not sure actually. I guess I'll just halve the resolution, fuck it. Well you have to keep in mind it's going to be a super small element. You have the specific color for the Koopa? I don't know what his color is going to be yet, why? Just wondering. Alright I'll just put in a new color. I have a bad idea on how to make this look. Between prim and tex using a little bit of lighting. Okay I'm not doing that but don't worry about it, I know what I'm doing. I think 16x16 looks too bad so let's do 32x32. I should never have written the texture, shit. Shit color alpha, shit color alpha here. There we go. So someone said that we should also add the line to it and I kinda agree and that's actually kinda fitting for this texture here too. That's what I can do is I can just add the line like above him. It's just a bunch of jingles again. Okay now it's stopped. Okay I think that line is a bit too extreme but you get my idea right? So minus 12 and we'll also get minus 6 here. Why not? I kinda like it. That looks like a racing stripe, amazing. But now that I look at it again I think the stripe is too small. And it's still too extreme color wise. I'm not very good at using GIMP. Hey, this is what I want. The stripe needs a border. It kinda has a border here in the less extreme version. Am I using GIMP right now and not Photoshop? GIMP has a few features that Photoshop doesn't have which is kinda fucked up. How's the eye looking? Pretty good. Oh I like that yeah. I think I'm done with it for now. Just need to resize it. Alright he needs a shell color. The shell color should be a variable with the parameters. I'm not coding nude. It's just too warm to wear clothes right now. I'm totally regretting paying for Photoshop. I can't believe that they wouldn't add the features that I, a paying customer, needs. But here we are. That's the Koopa eye. Alright let me just do this first. I hope that works okay. We'll see. Alright. How long have I been using Blender? I don't know. Not something I think about. Not something I want to think about. I just want to make games. No I didn't actually have to learn Blender. It took about a week to learn Blender actually. Blender is really easy to learn if you just actually learn it. I don't know why people act like it's so hard. I think they just don't have any attention span. They don't know how to learn. Yeah I don't know if this is just a me thing but I feel like when I'm here I just want to be here and do the thing. And that's just how I approach things in my life in general. I just want to not have to deal with all this being a human and asking questions and being social stuff. I just want to get stuff done. Yeah so this shell texture is awful. Yep that's a bad shell texture. Let's find a good Koopa shell texture. I feel like I should have one already. Surely Bowser's shell should work. I think that one is also used on Koopa the Quick too. Bowser's old shell texture. We don't have Koopa the Quick. But you have Bowser. I don't have Koopa the Quick. Yeah that's fine. I'm telling you that his shell has the same texture as Bowser's shell. You should have that. It's the texture. I will just propose it. Yeah if I make this a greyscale this could work. Since the start. Wait so. What was my first game? Do you actually know those? Some of them are pretty awful. I don't know. Put a dragon into Legend of Zelda. Wait what? Did I? Alright I think this works for his shell. Instead of this he should have his shell belly thing. A reskinned Link as a dragon. Oh that wasn't me I think. That was Zelda that someone commissioned me to do that. And I gave that commission to Zelda. I guess somehow along that chain the credit got to me. That is weird. You don't need any new Everdrive versions for that. My Everdrive V5 actually doesn't work for developing properly. So I always recommend that people don't get it and they just get the Chinese knockoff. Until they fix it. This should work well. I don't know. There is a server card system which is open source. Yeah but the Chinese Everdrive is like 50 bucks or something. And it does every single game except for Pokemon Stadium 2. I don't know. I don't know. Hello Hacker can I reply to you on Discord? I don't have any testing for you. Well if you just google Everdrive 64 and you find the cheapest one. Then you will get the Chinese knockoff. You won't even notice that you got the Chinese knockoff. It's just what happens. Alright time for Zeinas eye texture. What if I use Leelas intro in my next video? Wouldn't that be funny? I think the color you gave him is a lot more de-saturated here. Yeah probably. I think all you have to do is just change the background color. Yeah well there isn't really a background color here. It's all foreground. I gotta make the color match somehow. I think we'll paintbuckle the other one. The other layer. Won't that mean I'll just miss transition then? I think so. I think this works kind of. It's hard to tell from this distance if it works or not. I think this is what happens when I select the paintbuckle thing. Kinda works. Alright this should work. See his tired little eyes I Did the right way around now, they're reversed I Like this Hey He is not good feedback That's looking better It looks kind of soulless Yeah Why want me to do I Think you might have to fix the texture. So can you send me the Photoshop file? Sure Well, look it's dr. Stone No, he's got five guys I But I had to see I want the bunnies orange because I didn't set the color yet, I'm actually doing that right now Ffc 802 There you go Almost and true actually What shoes would he be wearing Like giving some work boots construction shoes This is what you were in construction, yes The brown ones are the brown Tim's are usually what you'd see what yes. No way. Yeah construction boots What the fuck this doesn't look very sturdy I Just build a Mario where just normal brown boots All right, we give him normal Cooper boots, I guess I don't have it hacker Hello CK death Shredder streams are finally back. Yep. I Was You wanna steal his boots You know what I'm just stealing a Yoshi's boots for this I think they're perfect I'm just gonna change the color up a little The Cooper's always have these green boots I Read Cooper's of red boots. So should the boots have the same color as like the shell And I like this as a spoot I Think it's a bit small actually at this I seems fun Let's try the next one Yeah, I see that How he looks done with this shit No, not like this, oh you got it you got the right texture. It's just the one on the UV map is not showing. Yeah Yeah, I like it I Don't he just looks tired Dude this is like if Mario characters ate a mushrooms get it because mushrooms is drugs Haha, that's a creative joke no one's made before I Think I'm actually gonna do it like this Might be a terrible mistake. I'm not sure yet I Yeah, I hit that All right, I think our Cooper worker is ready Animations if you wanna Any changes speaking might know God this section looks bad. It's way too bright. I Know why There we go, that is way better All right, any change requests speak you might know or shut up forever I Maybe this should be a bit more inside his body here Double or dark green. Okay, that's actually a good point. How can I make the stalker green without fucking everything up? I Okay, you know what this is probably just gonna be the same primitive color just like made darker like that Some sort of shading to the sides of the Cooper show there is shading on here Can you not see that I Guess I'm to have a mother wait. Okay. I'm not doing that. I don't give a shit about wafers It would be so awesome to have a million dollars. Hey anyone Anyone want to give me a quick million dollars? I Would give case a million dollars if I wasn't shot right now, I don't know but that's just me personally You How much is Nintendo gonna pay me though, I think just because they want to hire me doesn't mean I would agree to that I'm a current shop is really cool Man he looks so good in game. Actually. I like this guy a lot I Ready for animation Mm-hmm Send them over. I haven't imagined GPT videos. Nothing. They're still online. Why? All right, let me make notes which animations we need so Mm-hmm stands by idly It should okay, so we have stance yeah, maybe maybe there should be a talk animation. What do you think? Yeah, he looks better in game because still lighting in game is actually there and when that's not there Do I speak German? Yes, my Germans very good because I am born in Germany He definitely needs one voice angry Mm-hmm. Oh There needs to be an animation where they carry glass one on the left side. Actually, no, they can both be the same. Yeah Carrying glass There should be what an animation where they're just kind of upset that the glass is broken Yeah, so upset and sad that nice. It's broken Mmm, they should have a walk animation to walk animation Well, they have one animation, but they just fall and slide so fall animation That answered like the slide animation My body fat percent is probably around 18 to 20 They still have slightly visible apps if I flex them Let's see What other animations on this oh There's janitors too, but that's gonna be a different model He's tired looking on purpose he's tired of working construction You What's up Okay to sound just abruptly stopped I think that's all the animations we need and I'll just send you the list here You Okay, so he's supposed to stand here and get upset when you do that our cement pits usually gated off They probably usually have like a wooden Like a wooden stake or fence Yeah, let's cement funny I'm sure I can see it Oh The turtle Oh No All that for chicken Jeffrey fingered Carmina, he's supposed to look tired not a random I So is there nothing that's usually like gating up with cement I thought they did this year Yeah Let's put that around here then Like that's a thing that happens, people are just like behind on the video and that's why it seems like there's a lot of input lag. Man, that's a real problem. It's also this that you usually see around construction areas. Like this will fence off areas. I don't want that. Okay. Nah, that won't be that smashing. The whole joke here is that Mario runs around and ruins it. That can't be anyone else ruining it. I'm not motivated at all, so there's no motivation involved. I just do it. It's really that easy. It's not for free. I mean, technically I make a little bit of money from it, but I would make a lot more money if I just did literally anything else with my skills. This is actually a message from the past. When you hear this message, it is 2250 in the hour right now. When you hear it, it's probably going to be like 2310. I think I have a folder just full of rust textures. I should just use a lower resolution piece of shit texture. Check that that works. Okay. This doesn't actually need to be super accurate because they probably also just kind of slammed it in. I doubt Bowser's troops measured this out. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That is messed up. They let you do anything nowadays. Why does this level feel blank? Is it not filled up yet? Just a little structure? Yep. We haven't done anything yet. We've only modeled the general layout and we still need to actually put stuff in here. There's a lot of moving platforms. We're just making the things that we need in this level and then we're programming it and then replacing it and then that's it. I don't know. I don't know. What do you mean by you suck at Blender? Anyone can learn Blender. Blender is not anything that's difficult to learn. Just takes a bit of time. Alright we got our gated off cement bit. I'm kind of worried that this level is going to lag on N64 but I guess that happens with every level I make. I'm slowly approaching a point though where if I overdo it there isn't really much I can do anymore. I would have to cut back because there's no more things I can do in the engine really to save a lot of stuff. So basically what this is going to be. This guy is watching his cement bit that he just laid out. Elmer is going to come in and he's just going to ruin all the cement and the guy is going to get upset. What the fuck? What just happened? I suddenly went so fast. So before we have the guy's animations we're not doing anything. One thing I definitely want to do here is put the Toxboxes here. Where the Toxboxes are just going to run around here and we need to build our Toxbox guys. They have Toxboxes. Yes. I'm pretty sure I did. What's the code snippet? No model resource. Why would you do this? I hate model resource. Look what they did with this texture. They put it all into one. That's awful. And the artisan. Oh, I followed it pretty closely. I'm pretty sure I did remove it. Can we somehow fit the Toxbox design into the oil rig theme? I'm going to ask Chanchipiti. I actually really like Chanchipiti. I'll do this with you guys. I'm making a Mario 64 sequel. In the sequel Bowser owns an oil rig and various enemies run around. I want the Toxbox enemy to move around and do an obstacle. How can I change their design to fit the oil rig? Let's see. It's possible it's just an oil rig invader. In the oil rig theme you could redesign them as being made from metal or riveted steel to fit the industrial environment better. They might look like large shipping containers or mechanical cubes. You can add gears, pipelines, guards and wind-like structures. You can redesign them as an open hatch or control panel with buttons and levers. Oh, that's kind of cool. Chanchipiti is actually insane. I can create pictures freely? Can you give me a picture? It can't. Why do you say that? So could we give it a metal design? I mean it's already made of metal. Oh, okay.     Bing.ai is superior. I have my dots. Isn't Bing.ai the same thing? Okay, so the safety spot should look more like the... An oil rig thing. Let's see what we can pick. This OST is weird.  Metal shipping container. Doesn't it already look like a metal shipping container? I have metal shipping containers around here. It's kind of what the Toxbox already looks like. Actually, maybe I can just do this, but with a face on it. I'll give that a try. Okay. That's kind of cool looking. We can be somewhat liberal with textures on this. Because it's not an armature, so there's no risk of it reloading the same texture over and over.  Dots. That works. I don't think I can shrink it. Can I? Can. Oh, this is perfect. Now for the faces. These are just drawn on with paint, aren't they? There are no opossums in RTYI now. I am sorry to disappoint. Okay. Maybe container 2 is better. Mhm. I could make the faces symmetrical. Yeah, if we put symmetrical Toxbox faces on this, I think this is going to look good. Alright, this is going to be our Toxbox redesign for this level. I just need to put a bunch of faces on it. But, unfortunately, I have appointments today. I need to go hang out with people. And that has to be the end of the stream. Next time we're going to start programming either the Koopa guy or the Toxboxes or whatever else. I might actually have finished them by next time because I'm currently in a working mood and I'm getting a lot of stuff done next week. Although I still want to do a lot of bugfixes, so maybe not. So, I'll see you guys in the next stream.
