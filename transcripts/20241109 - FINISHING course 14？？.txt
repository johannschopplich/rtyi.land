You You Hello Kevin Hello Boris What is up I Am actually married And I used to have even a bigger jug but My wife broke it Yes, course 15 is the last course You In the sonic the Hedgehog That's did you forget to shave your balls and I'm getting bald shaving apps he served honestly You should have safety waltz You guys want to see what I did off stream you cannot color in Mario I Messed up his face color You Want prim color what do you mean prim color? Yeah, it's basically a virtual texture I added the texture dynamically to make it display as it does You can draw anything you want really you can So I'm gonna make it so that if you press this button here, it's all gonna clear with the rocket And This gets rid of the color on Mario so you can view it without drawing to it It's gonna have 15 retro gamer Any OST wishes for today I You Are you free the world we already did the last stream. I don't want that again You You Mario Mario Splatoon 3 side order. What's that? Oh, that's the DLC, all right You Let's listen to it very fitting for today It's an extra 6 over 6 or 10 or 2 128 by 64 it's 1632 by 32 I Know that Z You The miscellaneous use depends on your use case You They shouldn't be all lines but most of them Textures do cost a lot of bandwidth but look at this area here You think this is not gonna run at 60 It didn't work as intended I Forgot to clear The way the fill color works is interesting And You Yeah Yeah, that's what I thought when you move between instances of indexing like in the editor, I don't know what you mean Elaborate I Assuming between the fences to write index in your coach with ctrl f You It's to meet this way around I Also gotta do the roblox stream soon they're paying me to play roblox maybe I can do that on Sunday I Not quite where I wanted to be That's a word index, I think he needs the actual word index like text You There we go now it clears Mario's desire So, what are we gonna draw how about we draw a house So This will be the roof of the house Then this is the base of the house And then This is the other side of the house Okay I'm gonna have to make a color splooge here. Unfortunately, maybe not I think I like to be living in a red house I How about a black door All right, you can be here I forgot about that Probably I should be doing something so that that's more obvious. I mean just in just a vertex color slightly Okay, so I'm gonna draw the roof of the house Now it should be possible to perceive that there is depth to that Wait, why is it impossible here? Oh cuz the line is missing. Yeah I Think the door on our house should be brown All right needs a doorknob for sure Okay How about we make a little bit of grass around here I Think we need grass like here Oh god, please don't color in everything. Oh, thank you Blue sky The sky around the house. Oh that didn't fill everything Interesting Hello Gavin Just the way you explain Zima for oh it kinda is I Do not know of this Henry stickman Obviously, we're drawing a son I Have an idea Shit You know what we can erase I can erase part of this And then the Sun needs race obviously I Said undo option. Nope. This is something like a depth first search for filling. No, it's not intelligently filling at all It's literally just like fill this pixel and then every adjacent pixel with the same color And repeat that until there's no more pixels with the Jason colors It's cheap enough that I don't have to worry about it I Think we need clouds Something's off with the color of the texture here. Do you guys see that how the color is different on these two pixels? Now that I described that first I Program is inventing names for the most obvious thing ever This is my Earn the key first door open algorithm. The trick is you turn the key to unlock the door before you open the door It's Remember there's a recursive function. Yeah, but the stack is not big enough for that. So I can't do that It requires a function like that will just underflow the stack So I had to invent something All right, oh shit my house needs a window This was possibly poorly planned out Oh god, no, I'm cheating. No, I didn't mean to cheat. No, I wrote my painting by cheating There you go my house I want a brown roof The roof shouldn't be the same color as the bricks clearly I Made art Using scan lines I Don't understand but either way what I did is I just allocated memory and temporary memory. So this goes a rom space and Then I made it so that that is just being used as like a stack for pixels to be checked And Nixon's gonna play your demo and was actually really solid despite being outdated me so I put a final result now I see Seriously crazy when you have media really it's just MS Paint and Mario You Know what? This is a banger post. Let me just get the UI off here I Am gonna post this on Twitter I Must paint tomorrow 64 Best register this one So we still need The idea here is that you paint Mario We still need a guy somehow that looks at your Mario picture and evaluates it It tells you hey, this is a bad Mario or this is a good Mario or whatever And Okay, there's a buck here doing that doesn't reset your score so you can get infinite score That needs to reset your score God, this is in so many places and I have to keep redoing it. That's not good. Oh, this doesn't even... Shit. Shit. Okay, we need to make some serious changes. I think we can't store this here. We have to make a separate thing. And I should turn this into a separate function. So we probably want this whole thing here. Hello, playman? Where was the filter and color to write? Let me just verify this still updates the score. This is important. Yep, someone busted the soundtrack. Personally, never played Splatoon. Not really planning to either. Yep, that still works. Looks good. That turned out to be fine. I will make sure once. I don't want to mess everything up. Hello, official ham. You are the first. Sure, buddy. So, okay, what we need for the section here still. We need someone or something you can trigger to talk to. To have them check whether your Mario is good enough. And once we have that, we need a score threshold above which you get the star. Ah, fuck.  What? Needs to be something from Mario Paint. Is Mello in Mario Paint? Isn't there like a dog character in Mario Paint? I think he would be funny. There's also this one texture that I need to change. This one. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay, there we go. That makes your picture more wrong. But this doesn't correct your picture, so that's a problem. Undo dog would be great. I don't want to store an undo thing. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. We can't. No, no, no, no. I don't want to deal with that. It's still a game, guys. This is not an image editor. You fuck up, you lose your points. That's what it's going to be. You don't get undo, but you get reset. That should be good enough for you guys. I win Mario Paint. Paint Mario. So you guys want to hear something crazy? The Nintendo 64 has around one megabyte of hidden memory that you don't really use. But there's ways to use it. And I'm thinking of making a video about how to use the hidden memory that no one knew about. I think it's going to sound absolutely schizophrenic, but it could do well. Yes, an entire megabyte of memory. You're never going to guess where this megabyte is. You want to hear what a megabyte is? It's between the other bytes. Basically, on the N64, the byte on the CPU, you typically only see eight bits. But secretly, all the bytes on the N64 are nine bits. And there are tricks to read and access the ninth bit. And it's a little difficult to access, but you can do it. And it's a bit slow. And if you use that memory normally, you're going to get screwed a little bit, but you can use it. The fuck? Yep, yep, yep. I know it sounds crazy, but it's there. Is it like that in Cache, too? I'm not sure. But you can definitely read and use it. You can read it. You can write it. It's just a little slow, but not that slow. So usually this ninth bit is used for triangle rendering. It's the coverage bit, right? So you draw a triangle, and the triangle is halfway across the pixel. It's going to write a coverage of 50%, which two bytes combined to make the coverage value, which can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, right? So it's just going to write 1 or 2. So usually the bit is going to be used for that. But you can read and write to the bit on the CPU with a few tricks. Unfortunately, I only know of a way to read and write to every other bit on the CPU. So maybe there's a secret storage we can access by rendering sub-pixel sized triangles over bits of code or bytes of code, which would be the stupidest thing ever. I don't know. I hope this doesn't take long now. I might have to unroll the loop. I should probably unroll the loop a little bit. Hold on. Hold on. Keep that in mind. 3203504. It needs to reset to exactly that value. What the fuck? Oh. Hello, Super Wibros. Hey, there we go. Perfect reset. Now we need to figure out a way that the player can have their Mario score checked. Anyone know of any Mario Paint NPCs that would be good for this? Because I have never played Mario Paint. You don't have to count them. I could, but I feel like that wouldn't look the same anymore. I guess I could push this wall back. Eh? I don't know. I don't dislike the way it is right now. Yeah. Mario Paint NPCs. Let's see what we got. Gnat attack? We can't have a gnat, can we? Does this thing fit from the Mario Maker? It's also Mario Paint. What does he do? Maybe just Mario. Maybe we'll find something. Definitely not Mario himself. What? Robot NPC? Let's see. Mario Paint Robot NPC. Oh god. That's not him, right? Interesting animals. Will the only kind of Mario Paint music be playing while coloring Mario? Yes. Yes. I don't know. That sound effect is too good. It's interesting how it colors this. Is that to hide the fact that coloring it all instantly would be expensive? I don't see any characters in this game, unfortunately. I haven't seen the save spot either. I see the course part here. But it's not listed in Mario Paint. Oh, it's based on the robot that saves and loads painting in Mario Paint. But I didn't see him in Mario Paint. Where is this guy?  Species Robot. First appearance Super Mario Maker. I don't think he's in Mario Paint. I don't want to add a toad or something. Rocket Robot on wheels. I know one person that likes this game. This is the game with the weird fucked up camera sounds. It looks nice though. Mario Paint overpowering? Let's see. Oh, it's when you make it so noisy that the game compresses it. Oh, he has his own theme. That's nice. Okay, this guy is great looking. I like him. I like him. I guess it's because the image is too noisy. We're not adding a fly obstacle to this. It's difficult enough as is. Yeah, I get it. This guy would be perfect. I agree with the people. The question is whether we can find him. Let's try this resource. Let's see. We're currently thinking of how to make a guy that evaluates your painting. And we're thinking of using the paint robots from Mario Paint. Let's use the Undo Dog. Undo Dog was my first thought too. Just because he's cute and I didn't know he was the Undo Dog. But I'm a little bit scared that the Undo Dog will make people think that they can undo. And I will absolutely not add undo to this. Hello Skyloft. Yep, that's Mario Paint 64. We have a little rocket animation. It's all gone. My Mario, my masterpiece. Draw a dick? I'm not drawing a dick. Hmm. I want this sprite here. But it's difficult to get. Maybe I find a video of Mario Paint native resolution and can just rip it from there right away. So why not point filtered? I can make it point filtered. I just thought it would look worse. I mean, all these guys are point filtered. Just not Mario himself. You think it would look better if it's point filtered? Oh, yeah, it does kind of look nice. Let's try it. Oh, yeah, that looks way more crisp. I don't know why I didn't try it. He's on the ceiling? Yeah, the correct version is on the ceiling. The truth is, it's easiest for me to program this if I just put him in the level somewhere and this is gonna run at 60 FPS anyway, so I think that I might as well just put him on the ceiling. But who's gonna look at the ceiling, right? Gamers don't look up. Yeah, that looks nice. You know what, if someone looks at the ceiling and finds the perfect Mario draw on there, I don't think that's a bad thing. Yeah, we had to give the players some kind of visual indication of what color they were gonna draw and I think changing Mars clones was the easiest way to do that. I see what we did in the deck for the Luigi color schemes and have a custom message for these. It would cost a good bit of memory, but also, I mean, I guess you can do Luigi. Yeah, that would be a good easter egg. Same with Wario, but you don't have purple, so you can't do Waluigi. Can you differentiate them? They are different by region, right? So if I draw a circle here, I can fill the circle like this too. So Mario, the drawing looks like it stinks. That would be funny. Okay, but I need a way to actually get Corespond going here. The closest we got is this. How do I rip this model? This looks like a one-to-one resolution. It's a JPEG, really? You're gonna let me down like that? And your pixels are like free pixels? God damn it. Why he says Sega? I don't know. A GIF. Why can I not open this? Yeah, I agree, it's the best choice. I definitely want Corespond to work somehow, but I don't want to remake the sprite. Can I remake him in 3D? I think so. He looks so bad to remake in 3D. Still crusty. Is there no native resolution of him? No. Wow, this guy sucks at coloring. Look at this. Do you think Super Mario Bros. has the uncompressed picture? Please tell me he does. That would be awesome. What the fuck just happened? It looks like it's pixel for pixel, at least. I mean, it's on Mario Universe. Save for Mario Universe. Mario Paint, not Mario Universe. Let's see. This one? Oh my god, yes. It's a GIF. I don't know why I keep saying GIF. I just want to piss people off when I say GIF, I think. But no one's falling for it. Hmm. Best way to take him apart. He honestly just looks like a bunch of sprites above each other. Thank you, Skyloft. Finally, someone fell for it. Skyloft, I was thinking of maybe trying to 100% Skyward Sword after all these years. Me and Zeyna, we're currently playing through Twilight Princess. But playing Twilight Princess, I realized that what I like in Zelda games is all the open world and exploration and not really the dungeons. And in Twilight Princess, I feel like they're spamming dungeons one after another. And then I read online that Skyward Sword only has 24 pieces, so I feel like it's not going to be as open world. I think that's why I like Majora's Mask so much. What is Blood listening to? Cold Storage Splatoon 3. You'll hate Skyward Sword if you don't like the dungeons. That's fair enough. That makes sense. Yeah, for me, it was always the journey between dungeons. That's the best part. All right, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Okay, we take this part. That's Star's Texture. I think I am going to take a little bit of a creative liberty here. Not that much of a creative liberty. I just want to change two pixels. There we go. Okay. Ocarina of Time's journey between dungeons makes me want to shoot myself. Yeah, it's not that great on Ocarina of Time either, but at least there's like a little bit of it. Majora's Mask has the absolute best version of it, though, in my opinion. 64x89 is how big he is. So, someone was asking me to make another President meme hack, but I feel like the political climate of today does not allow for this. Any opinions on that? Are we all in agreement that it's not a good idea to make a president meme hack? This won't fly in 2024. Yeah, I think so too. I think people generally will murder me. The problem is, okay, when I made Trump 64 in like 2016... Wait, what was that? When I made Trump... Thank you for the resub, Aste. Okay, you're gonna regret resubbing at this time, but... When I made Trump 64 in 2016, you could do anything on the internet. PewDiePie called someone the n-word like us an insult in 2016 for shooting him in a video game, right? And when you made the Trump 64 hack, no one took it as a political statement. But if I do the same thing in 2024 with the Trump 64 ROM hack, people will murder me. So I can't do it, I think. I can't do it. I can't do it. I'm a lot more serious now, but if you made a similar ROM hack about someone like Javier Milai, I think you'd get away with it. Okay, but zero people who know who that is, including me. Nomi memes are so cringed. True. It's two pixels. I don't even blame the Hog Tour girl for the whole Hog Tour thing. I blame all the people that were ironically posting it. The Elan situation is still so bizarre to me. I don't understand. He's so rich. Why does he care so much about what random people think online? I'm thinking about what to put on the top. Right now. That seems realistically like what it would look like. Yeah, that's nice. I don't want to have to animate his whole body like that. Oh, God. Did you mean while I was streaming? Did you not see me tweet while I was streaming? Ah, shit. Now I need to count the pixels, I guess. Fuck. How many pixels from the ground is this? Surely, I have a better way of counting that. Half of Steamers is white. You're probably right. But I would need to change the texture for that. Probably, he only has one front side like that and then two sides that are like nothing on it. Yeah, okay. I'll do that after I'm done with this part here. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 20 pixels up. And he was 27 whites. So, here seems to be an accurate location. Did you see me live-streaming while I was tweeting while not live-streaming? True. Okay. Okay.   This seems wrong. What is going on? Why is it like this? That's good. What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, it's the stupid blender bug. Oh my god, dude. How did they fuck follow ActiveQuad so bad? Guess what? I just forced to watch balls shaving heads. Let's go. That's what you get for not shaving your balls. I'm going to have an FTA issue just saying. Oh, maybe I should upgrade and maybe that will fix all my issues. Maybe? I don't know, man. What the fuck? So these hedges are clearly beveled on him. Ooh, that's looking nice. Yep, this is a Mario Paint retro section. I only want him looking something like this. Why do these feel bigger? Actually, that makes sense. Damn it. There we go. So I'm gonna do a little bit of 3D modeling trickery here. I'm gonna do a little bit of 3D modeling trickery here. I'm gonna do a little bit of 3D modeling trickery here. Also, you missed Mario Paint. Or Paint Mario. Look at it, you can paint Mario. Fuck, I fucked up. It's okay. I can delete them. Or I can bring this back. Isn't that cool? This is a bit difficult to color because of the graphic plugin I'm using. There's a bug here. Yeah, it's for the Mario Paint retro section. Fix those T-junctions you just created by stretching those polygons. What is a T-junction and what is there to fix? Explain what's wrong. Are these squares a draw call? No. I don't know what you mean by T-junction. I'll have to be more clear. Is a T-junction an edge on an edge without a vertex like this? That's not a problem. And you want me to stretch the polygons like this? That ruins the UV mapping. Do you want me to stretch without affecting the UVs? That's still not great because now I get this pixel here. These are 3x3 dots. Well, your idea doesn't work.  I have to keep in mind we're in N64 land here. The worlds are a little different from what you might be used to. 8, 9, 10, 11. Okay, it's 11 continents up and they're 4x4s. This is bad. You haven't given me a reason. Explain yourself. Why do you think they're bad on the N64? Why do you think they're bad on the N64? I'm a quadcopology fan of the N-Gauntlet. Enjoy it. True, true. I'll probably use the UVs from this texture here. Super Mario Bros. 3. Oh wait, I can only have one. Yoshi's Island is easy. I only like Yoshi's Island out of the originals. Mainly Mario games. And I think the others just wouldn't be interesting to me, right? Mario Bros. is good because it was the first game that was designed. The first game design, like an invented game design. And then after that, it's all just like... Okay. Wait, this line here, it's not even on the official thing here. It's on this texture here, but nowhere else. Interesting. This is so Splatoon. I don't like Super Mario World. I hate Super Mario World. I don't like 2D platformers, like at all. I only like Yoshi's Island because... It has Yoshi in it and he makes cute sounds in the game. I don't like Yoshi's Island. You're not a cute dinosaur. I know this is devastating to hear. I'm sorry. That didn't mean it as an insult, but you are not a cute dinosaur. It is what it is. I'm still waiting to hear why T-Junctions are bad. I need an explanation. Like Mario Romba? Nope. What's that? It's when ledges intersect without having a vertex. At least that's what the guy said. Maybe he was working for Nintendo, trying to sabotage me. Oh, I believe you that you like Wanda. Or that most people will like Wanda. It's just that I know I don't like Wanda. I don't like 2D platformers. So I'd be a fool to try and buy a 2D platformer. Because visible seams I think mean floating points. N64 is fixed points. And these are world axis aligned. Which means that the rounding arrow there will always be 0. And there can't possibly be a seam. You think I didn't think of that? That would be my response to that. Yeah. If you do stuff like this and it's not world aligned, then yes. It can open worlds. But you know, it will be perfectly aligned. Oh, we still need to model the back of it somehow. Without all this shit on it. I could just do what I did initially for the back here. I don't know. Have any of you watched Dragon Ball Daima? So far. I wanna talk about Dragon Ball Daima. Yeah. Yeah. What's going on? That should be decent. This is a 1 to 1 copy of the actual texture used on the guy. I mean in detail. Now what's with all this shit here? Did we just make this a 2D thing? Shit, that's so much shit. Oh no. And it's so round too. That doesn't really translate well into scuffed 3D. How does that translate to sprites? We can make it extremely unnaturally round. Because this area is gonna run really well anyway. It could be enough of a cool look. Or it could be octagons. I think octagons always do well. How many pixels off the floor is it? 42. 42 and 22. So 10 coordinate octagon. And it's on both sides? Is it the same on both sides? 22. 42. Yes, there's an octagon like this on both sides. Cool. Octagon for a cylindrical message. Let's see. This is 5 pixels like this. This is comically high poly. Oh no. Oh no. No. How many pixels is this? It won't tell me. Cool. 65. 65. It doesn't add up. What did I do? How does it not add up?  There we go. That was weird. And then the top part is... 17. 17 by 6. Oh my god, that's so weird. This is 10. Did I make this way too big? 20. Was it supposed to be 10 pixels and I made it 20? Nope. Hey. Oh, this one's way too big. It's supposed to be like that. It's supposed to go over the top by seven coordinates. There we go. Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm not worried about it. That's why I'm making him somewhat high poly to be more accurate with the sprite. So from five to 8.5. Oops. Also fits completely wrong. Right. So it's twice that. Hey, that looks pretty accurate to me. I mean, it's 300 triangles. It's less than Mario's model. So it's not that bad. Hey, Jennifer, America's president. I don't think they would vote me. I wouldn't be the worst thing to happen to humanity ever. And you may think, in case you're exaggerating, you can't be worse than Trump. Trust me, do not underestimate me. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven. So it needs a more competent. OK, but wouldn't you rather have someone incompetent trying to screw over than someone competent trying to screw you over? Think about that. Screw people on purpose. I mean, I only have four years in office, right? I have to make as much money as I can in those four years. Hello in the official ham. Does any money I'm registered wealthy, please do. See, this is where my island idea comes from. I say that instead of having a ruler that interacts with the people, we just need like 100 people that we send to a lonely island. And they're not allowed off the island and no one else is allowed on the islands. And they have to rule the country from that island. And the money they get is like correlated to how well the people outside the island are doing. And this is my political system idea. Don't steal. Oh, see. You're not allowed off the island. Your children are not allowed off the island. You're not allowed to have personal contact with anyone off the islands. There's a thing on here and it's like five by something. Looks kind of like that. How big is this? Eleven. Hello, woman. I'm going to give myself a funny girlfriend. Some awesome psychology, maybe. I don't know. Make the line. You get what I mean, guys. You would force someone to be a girlfriend. I don't know if I get what you mean. That doesn't sound very good, Leila. Hello, Leira. Oh, right. The two characters for the Yoshikons are still missing before this course here is done. I forgot that. We're currently working on the Mario Paint robot. Dude, I can't listen to this anymore. Oh, it's extended. No wonder it's so shit. We need something else. Any OST wishes, anything, please. Anything but that. I don't play single songs, but we can just play from there. 14. That's not 14. That's not 14. I don't think I would like Bayonetta. I don't like boss fights in video games. In general, they're very boring. Did we end up naming the ice level? I forgot when we gave it some kind of name, but I don't think it's final. You would be a great boss fight. Leila, you would die as soon as I look at you. It can't be a boss fight. That could be a boss fight. That would be a banger boss fight. Make me one.  Shit. How do I model this? That's difficult. I can do this at least. I can do this. What's the parallel RDP thing? What's the parallel RDP thing? Oh, yeah. I tried to fix the RTYI crash, but we literally couldn't figure it out. It just doesn't work in parallel. I talked to Falco. Oh, I see. Yeah, that seems pretty annoying. Project 64 Master Race. The game when Parallel's strongest defender died, which is Leila. Actually, yeah, you could be a boss fight. You could be like a boss fight that tells you to use parallel over and over. We got gassed by Falco. It happens. This is how you feel. Dude, this happens to me every day. People, especially Falco, tries to gaslight me, deletes my downloads. It is what it is, man. The entire Romnigan community is trying to gaslight me. Hello, MarioLuigiSM64. Yes, guys, we should team up. We should team up with Project 64 1.6. Okay, fun. At least RMG. At least RMG. I'm going with RMG. Or Nemuel. Or Alphys. Or fucking anything that isn't Parallel Launcher. I'll team up with that. This goes forever. I don't want to listen to this song forever. I don't want to listen to this. What are you making? The robot from Mario Maker. And Mario Paint. Can you let go, please? I would like to select things in the image. Oh, my God. I don't know how to use GIMP. Whatever. I don't know how to use GIMP. The robot from Mario Paint. He saves your levels, basically. Or not your levels. How many pixels is this? 10. Now the pixels match one to one. Yes. What other games have you worked on? The game I'm working on is still not finished. And I'm under NDA. So I can't tell you. It's a very long-term project. Yes. Yes. What the hell? Oh, well. It's probably fine. No, it was just a random idea for a place in the world. Working on Fortnite. Shit. They found out. Oh, my God. You know what, this doesn't have to be perfect, I'm pretty sure it was meant to look like this. That should be fine. What happened here? Fuck. Oh, I see what happened. Also not my intention. There we go. I accidentally copied the material wrong. Well, this is from a SNES game, Mario Paint. So that would make sense. Yeah, I like him too. He is very high poly, but that's fine because it's such a small sub area. You know what? I'm actually curious how clearing the memory performs on the sub area. Let's try. I feel like there might be a small delay when I do that. I mean, this is 50 FPS, so we're good. It can do that without any issue. No lag at all. Oh, the entire game crashed, or the render thread rather. Yeah, I'm planning to make indie games eventually, there is this idea of maybe asset swapping Return to Yoshi's Island when it's done and releasing it under my own IP, because the only vanilla actor I use in this game is Mario himself, so if I swap Mario and all the other That could be like my first indie game Yeah, I'm planning to make indie games eventually, there is this idea of maybe asset swapping    It's a good song man, I will take you to wonderland But this is another extended mix, god damn it I'm so sick of extended mixes man There will be illegal content, there could be an argument that you're advertising indie games as a placeholder for now Is that illegal? That's the question I don't actually know Either way, it's definitely something I would have to talk to a lawyer about, so that's true Yeah, I'm planning to make indie games eventually, there is this idea of maybe asset swapping     Alright, now just the hat Yeah, this is the same song for 30 minutes Yeah, but it's like a brain damage song if I do, it's different Yeah, I'm planning to make indie games eventually, there is this idea of maybe asset swapping  I request 1 million MrBeast for our extended mix Dude, we need a whole 1 million MrBeast stream That is what I want in my life Sometimes I listen to 1 million MrBeast like 3 times at the same time Roblox seems dope, right? Yeah, they're paying me money to stream Roblox, like I'd be stupid not to take that Okay, my plan for the Roblox stream, we're probably going to do it on Sunday I don't know if we're going to do it in the morning or in the evening or whatever I'm going to stream Roblox on Sunday And maybe I'm going to make a Discord and everyone can just join and play Roblox with me We're going to have a nice Roblox hangout Can I add you? I don't have a Roblox account yet Yes, it's Roblox itself paying me, I'm pretty sure It's giving you tears? Is it so bad or so good? I don't understand I don't understand Okay, so the size of this is... 32x22 Mixed 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30   30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30    30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30  30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30  30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30    30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30   30x30 30x30    30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 30x30 It's amazing This is the truth Let's just take first type of the core native it's a little more optimized I think he should be bigger because it takes a lot of time to do. I can make him like a skill 4 maybe Yeah, we used a word texel density correctly Eh, 3506, not gonna 1,2883 4 anywhat That was obvious, you should have known that Okay, no, I don't like this You know what album I liked that came out a lot recently? Anyway, you guys have to listen to it now, it's Antagonist This is a good song I will pester you with my tongue taste now What are you gonna do about it? Alright, so Does it need to be a yes or no option so we can't actually use the Wild West NPC talk thing? Hmm, there's an ask Mario function we have Aren't you answering the question? Why are you adding me? I'll ask someone else Why is it gonna be me? Everyone here knows You know what? Actually, it kind of makes sense that you're asking me because I'm the streamer I mean, while yes, you can see the neutral polygons You will still see their effect on the output pixels So I don't think it's like nothing QRT this with impressive RTYF footage Yeah, yeah, maybe Shit, how do we respond to this without looking like an asshole? 32 question mark, 8 megahertz is all I need I could like All I need is 8 megahertz and 30 MHZ And then a picture of RTYI I don't have good footage right now What would be good footage here? Hmm, let's talk to Mario function 100 megahertz, who needs all that? Yeah, yeah Although, see, there's a second layer to this Because we say 300 megahertz, who needs that? We only need 30 People are gonna be like, but the N64 is 94 megahertz And then we can be like, but I'm not using it I only need 7 milliseconds on the CPU What you mean? The bomb can rework when it's finished yet Yeah, we have to use something else I mean, I would record some oily boily bathing real quick Or some zoo thing but Unfortunately I can't record right now because of the gaming But yeah, it's 20% CPU usage because the games don't know how to use all cores It's not really saying much, right? It's like being, oh, I'm so inefficient, I don't even make use of 80% of my hardware It's not a flex And the games that do use 1090 megahertz, yeah, Mario 64 Because it fucking sucks Sorry, I was a little mean Anyway That's not good We can't use this, oh, actually we can I like this More fun to drive in a slow car than to drive slow in a fast car Yeah, yeah, I see that Modern games use more cores Because to do that you need to parallelize all your processors Which is kinda difficult to do It requires a lot of synchronization and stuff like that And it's not that simple 437 minus 256 What may one? Am I stupid? Am I an angel or devil? 438 and 439 It's over, I moved on What I'm going to do next is going to be much better That orchestral, classical thing I liked it a lot But I have to move on You cannot redo a hundred times what you've done in the past It's not because it works that It's because you can't do it  I have to keep doing it Is this Frenchman talking?  He's the guy making these songs He's my favorite musician  I must see Crash when I talk to him Okay, so it's actually the act of talking that branches Oh, because I end the animation Because I just copy pasted this from a different code Well, no wonder Too bad All right, all right, all right I see I see That's a definitely ask Mario I'm using it And that's the job I mean, it's insecure And if someone sends you a virus and you open it with this Then you're going to get fucked So just don't open a virus You can't see me And a smaller and does not It's a More empowering score Now he should say bad if I talk to him by the way And then if I do it well, I should get a star What? Less than I also want him to Ask me the question instead of just Saying garbage That Is bad I still have to change the dialogue So I have a currently set to where if you get the Number in the bottom left corner below 1,000,000 then you get the star So now he should be giving me the star Good Nice And he doesn't do this Okay Interesting Oh, I see why I have the same  All right No Why did coloring it correctly Because the lower this The The more right I am The more the score drops So let's say I make Maurice had brown It increases And anything you draw Outside doesn't matter And now increase Because I drew completely wrong So But you can mess up a fair bit Before it doesn't work anymore, right? You can even like What else can I do wrong Let's make Mario's face brown It's still good enough Now it's not good enough anymore But honestly, if you draw Mario like this You don't really deserve the star Oh no, he's starting to look like an emoji Can you make him yellow and still win You can win like this You can be this wrong and still win Can you reset if you mess up? Let's do it Back to normal Dude, that's going to be interesting to see what the speedrun strat is Because he can be pretty wrong before it doesn't work anymore Yellow is also kind of red, so it makes sense Oh, but it doesn't actually help How is it still so wrong I guess I guess white is just so expensive Kind of need to get his mustache right That dropped the points by quite a bit Yeah, you have to be at least a little bit correct, I guess Okay, now we have Mario-like by far Is this colorblind? I'm not I just want to see how wrong you can do it before it doesn't work anymore So if I just do the cap and his face And his nose And maybe an ear Maybe the beard Oh, that's the speedrun strategy Look at that That's going to be the Mario that speedruns draw Oh, that's fucked up There we go Should we just up our Mario broth Shit, how did you do that Because I was feeling about Who's live on Twitch? How do you raid someone? Maybe I can type this in chat Can we use the right counter and completely remove Mario's head? Yes you can, you can also just clear this with the rocket But yeah, I'm done for now And I will see you guys next stream Which will be tomorrow Bye bye
