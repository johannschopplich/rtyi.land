Hello, Judy Testa. Is this live? No. This is pre-recorded. I have used quantum tunneling to send a stream into the past. Hello Droidseeker. Hello PapiPrinny.  Where's Laila? Laila here today. I hope Laila joins so we can yell at her for the random mode bug. Hello SonicTheHedgehog68. God damn, you're either very old or have another reason to put 68 in your name. Leave Laila alone. Why? I want to yell at Laila. Can't get 64 because it was taken. Yeah, 68 makes just as much. Oh, so 64 to 67 was taken. That's funny. The overworld music is a banger. Once you've bullied Laila off the platform, who else will you bully? That is honestly the best argument against bullying Laila I've heard so far. What the fuck is this shit? Who thought this was a good idea? Actually, it makes sense. Yeah, this is actually unfortunately the correct thing to do it. Ah, shit. We should open a new file for the overworld. Debooba likes chicken and rice. That is good news. Debooba is my child, by the way, in case you are wondering why she is Debooba. I am unsure. Zayna just started calling her that and now she is Debooba. Any OST wishes for today? Because she is a booba. Ah. Oh. What about sunbathing on the beach? Feels a little unfitting, given the context. Fork on a plate. Interesting suggestion. I think not. Red detective boogie 2. I don't know about that. Red detective boogie was good, but two in a row? More a galaxy 2. That's an interesting one. Oh no. The fucking heaters are done. Zayna, that better not be you. I should rename this. Render function table. Type. Hi, coolie. Ah. Hi. I can't do the cat face back at you, unfortunately. I don't know how to do that. What is today's discourse? Dude, where does it set the type? Do we actually use this one? Really? It is used? It is not used. It is not meaningful. Okay. We can simplify this code. That makes things easier for us. Okay. Okay.  Get away from Hong Kong? Yes, actually, I think so. My new phone. Why, did FedEx write you? That does not mean it's a real email. Make sure you actually verify it's all good. You have the tracking number? Nice. I'm getting a new phone, guys. For free. And I need to make a review of it as a punishment. I love games with Amazon that's next to his face. What? What's the phone? I have no idea. But it can't be worse than my fucking dusty-ass Samsung Galaxy S6. Dude, my phone is so old, it cannot play YouTube videos. It is older than 10 years. Why? You have no idea how much of a cheap fuck I am. I hate spending money. No, I live in, or I used to live in northwest Germany. Maybe this should be part of the area layout. Ah, actually, I think it works better here. Niedersachsen is a real punishment. What's so bad about Niedersachsen? Okay, but a decent newer phone would be like 100 to 200 bucks. I don't want to spend 100 to 200 bucks. That's like two and a half Mario Karts. Hello, Sarah. What the fuck? My keyboard switched to German mode. I hate when it does that. I thought it was switched to... yeah. Okay, I crashed the game. Okay, so we have an infinite loop here. Does the chat carry over to Twitch? Yes, it does. Oh. We're going to do the Android thing. The music got aborted? Yeah. Isn't that nice? Ba-da-da-da-da.  His wet foot thing works. It didn't save my setting. Yes. Such is the plan. Why does this not do anything? Hello, gamer. Why is this function not running at all? What? Huh? I have no explanation. Can I do something stupid? Yeah, overworld music. I can show the music in full after we have this working. Before that, I don't want to. Okay, how can this not be playing? That's actually insane. What? Well, they're not necessarily new Super Mario Bros. boss. They're also kind of like the Star Select boss. You know, if you think about it. It plays once and then never again. Okay. Nothing's good. Oh no. Why is the water making foam on those rocks from the other sides of the waves? I don't know what you mean. I think so too, Super Skizzle. I'm pretty sure the OST of this is mostly composed with the same instruments as the vanilla game. Okay, is me writing this here going to be the issue? No way, right? Huh? What if we just kill Mario slowly? Will that happen? Because maybe the render bug introduced by Fast64? No? It straight up just stops running after the first time. Is the problem that I'm incrementing the flags? Is this not allowed? Yep, you're not allowed to increase the flags. Oh, of course, because if they're non-zero, then it's like a not execute function. So we're using the draw layer now. Fast64 bug, do you not see the issue with everything here? This seems like too much of a tight, and it's too fast. Let's do a wave height of like 12, and slow it down. Function? Ummm.... Because it's called func, we can change the parameter. The parameter? Oh, okay, okay, okay. This will work, this is perfect. Come on, take me back. Look at me, I'm doing... Doing proper castings and everything. Aren't I a clean programmer right now? Dude, why does this keep resetting? Oh my god. I gotta write fnatic. Yeah, so fun fact, I had to change the audio plugin, because there was a bug in the old audio plugin that made the music sound terrible. Why isn't while next not equal to 0? Because next is a closed loop that loops back to the beginning. It's actually a doubly linked circular list, but the backwards links are stored in separate structs that you can only find via a HashMap entry, because we don't actually need the backwards link, and they would... Shit up our cash blocks So make a ice love of the game already, yeah It's a rage bait though They just posted this because they wanted to piss people off and they managed to do it. Yeah, ten out of ten range, babe That's that's a crystal for you he just loves, you know being an asshole You What a face multiplied by 0x10 at 0x100 per frame. Oh, this sucks. You know why this sucks. It's because Yeah, it doesn't work we have to move this That's fine though because that means now that this is animated at 60 FPS You Just really should have been defined here anyway You try to ask me everything I'm curious whether it looks the same in game Well, it's not gonna look the same in game because the x3 version we have doesn't have the extra features to make Fresno work yet So I can't try it yet. Hello zero walls You Yeah, they're not available yet Sauraen is working on a version of the legacy vertex pipeline that enables Fresno like a flag a set It's like linkless cash money. Yes, that's the whole point See, okay. I did something crazy the way the linked list works is That actually if you wanna assess the links of the elements You need to do a hash map lookup to actually find those links. So because of that The the links do not set up data cache unless you're specifically looking for them Which you only do on level load so it doesn't matter See me smart Okay, this is almost what I want but not quite Don't worry, bro. I'm the number one link this data. I removed so many linked lists out of an R64 engine. You have no idea It's this roughly what we want this looks good Should this be slightly offset face wise I think it should be we should They call me the link list in dealing on this is true And we got married they asked me what my name was and I said my name is the link was dealing You Know it's a lovely when this is actually a thing that commonly happens Is that like garbage programmers that don't really know what they're talking about, but they hear smart programmers talk about things They just copy an opinion without really understanding the reasoning behind the opinion and Then they will iterate that opinion back to you as if it's something that you need to take serious. That's like So they will tell you very confidently some things that are completely wrong and don't really apply to your situation Okay, I think this is the wrong Offset. So let's try that again Let me say but it would piss you off because you would have to change the whole thing So I know that you're gonna make you redo it. What what is it? This is still opposite Let's do minus what if we just do it zero zero zero To be fair you often confidently wrong. No, what does this happen? Okay, this is good give one example of me being confident Oh Hello ayahuasca Yeah, this is pretty nice oh Yeah, you guys wanted to hear the song there's still a back with the song but it sounds pretty good already Oops, that's a bar I Didn't nobody have noticed it quite often have you considered that maybe you were wrong in that moment instead of me I See I would love to be corrected when I'm wrong, but right now I can't I don't see it Marty is working on this either is basically done, but I haven't been able to import it yet. He's not quite done I See this funky palette, that's Lena's fault Same with the power meter Look when a cave and compare that You're convinced of using constant your code would make it run faster and the physics it does What do you mean? Of course using constant your code makes it run faster See you're just wrong Huh? What do you mean I can prove it I'll prove it to you right now and you have to redact your statement I can prove it Look at this The whole rendering graph node to be DC in size Let's look at rendering graph nodes Process object Look at a few const Const struct and I'm had a let's remove this const. Maybe this does it Okay, that one did not do it but there's other cons where it will do shadow rotation maybe doesn't do it What if I just remove every constant as far? Let's remove every const all gone Shit that removed some that weren't supposed to be removed. Let me add them back This one's a const This one's a const Start render buffer entries. This one's also a const I think Yeah, const And then wait render mode table Oh, this is not a const With a here One cycle this one's not const I guess Okay, we went from to be DC to shit There is places where it matters, I swear I've seen it matter I can definitely also take out the capitalized const once What the hell there is for sure places it matters no way Remember you're trying to anecdotally prove there but const is a keyword that's just supposed to guide you in the program The compiler doesn't care if you declare a const or not. It knows when you reassign it. Okay, but it can't know that like a function That I'm using Can't reassign it. I Swear I've seen it matter When did I see it matter maybe like in function arguments, I Don't know man, this is weird Why do I remember it mattering Well, I'm googling doesn't work like just because it's on Google doesn't mean it's true Clip it and shove it. Yeah, it seems to truly not matter here Maybe it matters when it weren't all functions being in lines I Gotta test this now. I gotta test it What about fret for sound TCC What if I remove those I Okay, what about tables though for those for sure it matters right imagine I read the table like at the top of my code and it's not marked const and Then I do some stuff that might change it and then it reads it again here. It has to matter there Surely it has to matter You Know the keyword volatile. Yes, that's for threats That's different Console is gonna be resigned only later on war. Sure The question is whether marking something as const can cause the compiler to omit additional instructions Okay, but think about this Yoshi party, let's say I have like const some table right, and this is my function and then I have Constant table And then I have avoid to do stuff, right and I have a equals some table One and then I have to do more stuff and then I have returned a Imagine something like this now Can't prove that this doesn't do anything to some table Well, well something like this and then you need to combine that you won't change the variable in another way Really So this wouldn't do anything It's const but it's not static meaning only the combination you had any of how might const cast away Should be constant static to have a chance of working What? So you're saying that? Static const would make it work But not if it's just const. Well, I guess if it's static then you don't need the const You Know I'm curious now When we're trying this 0 1 2 We're gonna do s32 S32 and then we're gonna have do more stuff to find here Undefined reference to do more stuff. Okay. Well There we go, let's see how big is this 3 2 easy Take the const away Still 3 2 easy. Does this change the assembly? Let's see And Let's be 0 from here. Oh, of course, let's let's press a into here You gotta do something like that 3 2 FC 3 2 easy const removed for instructions point proven. I Prove my point Constance here free to EC. I remove the const I compile again free to FC Let's go There's not how did the house is not a proof I prove to you that this removes for assembly instructions Do you want to look at the generated assembly? You just found an example where const does something yeah it optimized them Isn't that what the question is? We can't look at the account to generate assembly Make a pallet to what what do you mean? Let's look at this It reads the thing from a zero and Then Reads it again like this At the const So this is this was to memory reads And right here It just adds yeah, you see that it optimized out the memory read and just did a straight-up addition Because it's a const And that's and allowed the pro that the compiler to optimize it What more proof do you need And see how it's also shortcuts here it's safe to memory reads and for assembly instructions They've set none of thet nothing  I don't know here. How can you deny I'm wrong here? How can you deny I'm right here? I Want to make a glare constern buffer for to my just to extra constern buffer you didn't Huh Yeah, well Yoshi party also learned something new the one example where he said I was confidently wrong I just proved I'm right I Can't argue with you on this example, it's way too specific. I'm not familiar with your code or MIPS Okay, but it doesn't matter right? Like you've just seen that remove two memory loads and remove four instructions How can you even like consider that it doesn't do anything Clearly it does something to the compiler. I think that's proven because the compiled code changed and If you understand maps, you would also understand that just remove two memory reads and four instructions It's Google this does consts make your code more optimal Even the AI overview says that However const apply to a thing makes it better. Yeah applying con even Google agrees with me what? Is the funny examples Okay, I can discuss too slow what's your bench just like 315 But Can anyone deny that I just proved my points didn't I like beyond question no Even you have to admit Yoshi party that that was pretty compelling proof You Don't think my example proves anything, I'm sorry, but I have to dismiss you as a crazy person here I have a video of me doing 315 I Mean doing it for a couple years like five or so Can you explain why you think it doesn't prove anything? because I think even without MIPS understanding you saw that it was four instructions last and You saw that the LW the load word instructions were gone I'm trying to understand your mindset here Pounds and kilograms is like 142. I think how many stars in your world probably between 20 and 30 Okay Okay, so the next thing I want to do is add a decal layer of sand here that goes like Darkish and then comes back to like whitish and we needed to fade out towards the bottom So that the sand looks nice So My understanding now of constant has been updated to const only does something if The code is not entirely self-contained within the file that you're working in So in that regard I have learned something But I think the assertion that I'm confidently wrong is completely false Because not only have I said that because I have specifically noticed it optimizing it something but I've also proved that What I've said when I was caught up being confidently wrong is actually true And also Google agrees with me, which I think that's where you heard that what I said was wrong Somewhere online at least How many stars are you aiming for in the overworld? Oh, I already read that Looks like it's my mom's writing me It's just intently trying to piss me off. I don't think so. I think he's a good guy. I just think yeah, you know He was wrong about something I'm not trolling. Honestly, I Believe you that you're not falling. Don't worry. I Was wrong You know bench 165 Yeah, 1 3 15 is it is beyond what many people can do naturally. I Wouldn't like tell people that they have to bench 315, but like going for 225 I think that's like a noble goal that every man should do This is proof Let's see I Not quite sure what I'm looking at are you doing something like when I know it constacle shorter? Yeah I Think that's also illustrates it just can't imagine listen to you and Google fast enough in parallels Can you see your waves don't work the foam doesn't act like that by the cave entrance let's me look at the cave entrance I Use restricts, but restrict us at all with something else Well, because like there wouldn't be foam here I guess but that's for Biobak don't worry about it We use those cons whenever side effects, but it's not as you do it a con specifically I See what you mean, and I can see that being true for other situations But I have looked at the assembly code, and I know that to not be true This x86 shouldn't be MIPS I Mean, I guess MIPS would be more accurate for what you're doing, but the principle holds true regardless But also, I've explained my const would do something in an example, and then my prediction came true So like shouldn't that be proof to you like doesn't that explanation make sense to you? I need something wavy, but not too bad wait. What if I look into alpha overlays? And then I pick a soft grassy thing Because we only need the shape I think most of these are poor shape storm Something like this could work Will not look like it goes up and down the Sun like that It should only come from direction to the origin rather than direction of descent Hmm Let's look at that Of course they cut the gift right before we care Oh They cut the gift to They cut the gift to Stop cutting the gift I'm losing Come on please please You assholes why do they ever cut the gift come on Ah Yeah, I see what you mean, okay, it goes in and then it kind of fades out Think what comes really does and how a compiler sees your code example What would the compiler do if you modify the console which you can do? Yes, then you would have lights to the compiler by pretending. It is const when it isn't Lying to the compiler to make the compiler produce more optimized code is something I very commonly do You you have a misunderstanding here your compiler is not compiling for every eventuality Your compiler is compiling with the assumptions you feed it And when you feed it a wrong assumption such as an array being const when it really isn't then it is going to compile errors It's probably like 95% maybe 90% Spencer We Expanded their cheese shots. No, we can add seashells, but we're not there yet we're not doing the details like that, but just getting the the Sheena's ready I I Think I have beaten the allegation of being confidently incorrect right now So that is also true. If you don't make a variable const and don't modify it the compiler sees the same changes to the variable exactly And that's why it has to note from the variable again because it is not marked const and it can't be a hundred percent confidence That the variable hasn't changed which is why there is additional lines of code or generated assembly That's the whole principle You Think I've also no I'm not thinking of volatile volatile is something completely different volatile means that the actual execution of your program mid function might be Interrupted and then the volatile variable might be changed by another threat outside of your function Yes, you ready. You're doing the exact thing that I said people would sometimes do on my videos where? They're just posting wrong stuff because they heard it somewhere without actually knowing about it you Need to like take a step back and think about which parts of Your your mindset regarding programming is knowledge and which part is just stuff that people have told you Using the restrict keyword, of course Okay, so I want this to actually fade out towards the bottom so what I'm going to do is Like so This is actually going to work so the idea I had is that this would Scroll up and then scroll down again the problem if I do something like this and then fade it out towards the bottom here Then The bottom would also move back and that would look really bad. What if we combine this with a multi-texture? Do you have a simpler idea bio back You can switch to pre-order in or you're not interested I'm not interested I don't play games The game I'm most interested right now is the Oblivion remaster, but I would never buy it Once there's a reason I can't does make secret faster. He's wrong Okay, let's see This is actually of SNM, this is true Oh  If they call the consensus divisions Let me see Here's a gun even the website you linked has a difference So There's two meanings it can mean the variables are read-only It may not be constant. It can also mean that the verb is actually constant one the new console you and then Mm-hmm What did I miss in chat so this doesn't actually show that I Can't read all this right now But Even he has shown a difference. Oh, I don't know Const here's the cons reference to oh, it's a cons pointer. Yeah, of course. It's different. It just means that the pointer is const It's There's a big lamb running and seizing const actually against medieval the strictly superior, okay, but that's not we're arguing about We're arguing about whether that's a performance difference And yeah, I'm very confident your understanding was just wrong and I mean even the guy shot that I Don't mind a little argument I mean if I generally did something that is like false and I was incorrectly wrong I was confidently wrong then I would love to be corrected on it And so I can avoid that or if it's something important even issue a correction But in this case, I just don't see it I think you were very wrong to assert that I was being incorrectly confidently incorrect And we have proven that I'm someone who doesn't really take any issue with being corrected. I just care about becoming as good as possible Okay Okay, so for this one we need something like the opposite of this I think When we need to rotate the other one 90 degrees Is there a way to just turn an image 90 degrees in Photoshop Yes, there is I'm gonna write about off the process what is yet? But would you consider adding coconut palms and sprung Mario upon walking under them for them? It's definitely something that would be funny. Maybe that could be like a joke somewhere with something else You know to know when cons matter for automation is when it doesn't just saying the constants nothing is completely false. Yeah So it's good if us as improvement by this point your end is proven that what you're saying is correct and this guy and having it Yeah, but I also feel bad just being like how everyone on chat is ganging up on you Therefore I'm right like that that feels intellectually dishonest to me. I Wanted to actually like understand what it is But I think maybe the right thing to do is to just you know, cool off as You belittling and offensive as it sounds like anything that might just be What I have to say, unfortunately Don't worry Yoshi party. No reason to feel bad Why not simply do that Oh for the foam Hmm It's not that simple Because with the foam you have to keep in mind We have a transparent part so that one half would have to be transparent decal but also it moves up and down So we would have to align it with the sand Properly Can we align it with the sensor easily It's not that easy to align it with the sand that would be like floating in the air unless we also made the sands perfectly even You know what? I mean if we had like a subdivision of sand here everywhere, then that would be a little more reasonable But the fletch all I looks wrong It would have to be a little bit more reasonable Flat shoreline, it's impossible without I'm pretty sure He gets a good at modeling I have zero talent for modeling my modeling is all just Me, you know doing it a lot and getting into it. So if you can't do this, that's a skill issue I Doing with your channel after really yeah, I'm selling the channel No, I have no idea what I'm gonna do Oh Yeah, this is the wrong one You What about moving the water line up and down rather than back and forth it does move up and down and that makes it look back and forth Why are we doing form though? Why not? To see more mr. Transparent decal layer isn't enough to be mostly line up with the scent. Nope. Not on the n64 He's donating a shout-out to charity never Oh, why did this turn to an rgb a16 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Sorry, sometimes I just turn into a cat Why is it doing that Maybe comes in anything directly in the same orientation when hit by the wave crests in the same direction of the wave at the moving point of intersection What? In The compiler you used to link time observations and have you checked if that makes a difference Unfortunately, I'm really bad with compilers and I don't know how to set up link time optimizations and There's also some stuff that seemingly makes it not work with Mario 64 I don't know why it doesn't work with Mario 64 and but why Sky told me it doesn't work and why Sky told me it's Not easy to do So I am assuming that there's no shot. I will be able to do it Oh This is not good I Can't wait, let me think about this Why would this make more disappear what about to do this Oh God What if I add more shits to the left side of it What about using someone's Atlanta Like snow waves or stuff foam oh yeah I do have to worry too about LTOs I do worry that LTOs are just going to be less optimal than case time optimizations I think it's this one here that I need to expand what if you make it 256 by 256 I think LTOs have a lot of potential in making it run faster but I'm not a hundred percent confident that it will wait how is this different from just doing that why does it okay you know what that doesn't actually look like that it just I'm going to work off that assumption now just align this along the shore and then we'll see what's going on let's see how this looks you want the maximum texture size no way we would expand on blue no I don't think that's a good idea so it does actually fade out pretty soon see I was gonna make this pretty opaque and then have it move up and down to align with the water it's not supposed to look good right now it's just supposed to be an indicator of what we would actually get but seeing this I don't believe in it anymore I don't think I can make it work we might have to just say no sand so reason we have relationship lines enabled in the viewport helps me out of that easier I never gonna listen to that song all right fine we're gonna listen to that song together now I haven't we listened to it before meow meow meow meow meow I'm a cat he made it yes and I don't know if he put it on so on cloud console console compatible does not necessarily imply under 64 megabytes and but I am going to so all right enough of that yeah my emulator audio is kind of fucked right now so it's not very pleasant to listen to you're the fourth most that's funny so a bunch of people are just out listening to Badub songs that are not even in a finished game yet it's pretty cool actually I like that oh you guys don't even know this actually we updated the song for course so it is a new song slightly new the ducktales one was pretty good but I think having orchestra music is cooler that's my audio engine right now unfortunately fuck yeah my audio engine is not perfect yet I get that it feels unfamiliar at first but don't get too attached to something that is unfinished I guess holy shit I hate it what I didn't think it was that bad I thought it was cool use the light motif oh my god you guys are being gamers right now yeah I don't think it's all that different from the old one either and there's some parts in the song that are more high quality maybe it just seemed kind of bad because my audio engine is poopy right now the light changed yeah do not get attached too much to stuff in an there would be some amount of controversy but holy shit those reactions you weren't able to notice the difference that's good I suppose oh that looks kind of sick as fuck you guys know what I love I love keeping fishes I have a big plackle and I have guppies and I have shrimp and I'm gonna get a bunch of bristlenose plackle and it's the coolest thing ever hello I don't know Maso whoa oh it's just very slippery for some reason did I just see through the level geometry aggravated nostalgia that's what it's called hmm what kind of rock would work here I feel like this is a more stony path than this one but I'm not 100% sure I guess that feels kind of alright to me it's more like a lava volcano this way actually I think it's fine on these but not on this one can measure cashmere silence explore if you had as a time-based tech or a build encounter yeah I can there's a count register that counts the CPU cycles I can just cause a cash miss and then read the CPU count clock twice and I know the exact cycle count and I actually have done that in my last video about the random numbers I did it there honestly I don't think even might probably like oh that's cool I'm glad you like my song so much what if RT why I becomes famous and I start the MCN people that make hex based off my neck look at me I am Nintendo now we're getting the switch to okay I would never get a console at launch right now I don't think that buying the like what is it $700 for me I have no idea how much it costs I know everyone was arguing about it I haven't been part of the argument I mean all consoles at launch are a bad investment the idea is that some people are early investors and more people to develop stuff for the console and that makes the console eventually I guess many such situations where like the more people do something about it gets if if if if if if  if if if if if if if if if I need to buy one no well I mean I don't know what the future holds like if if if   if if

If you want, you just google how much does the Switch 2 cost in Canada, and then you'll know how far up I was. You need Discord then? Can't find the link in your video description? Or... Suuuuuure? Let me just... Invite people, copy, and I will post it in chat. Hidden use copy button? You fucking kidding me? When I use the copy button, it says hidden use copy button, and I... What? I can't copy it. It says hidden use copy button, I'm sorry. I use the copy button, and the copy button just copies the text that says hidden use copy button. Who wrote this software? That's a bug for sure. I see, but isn't there tax to that as well? So 15% tax, that's $1,050 for the bundle, and like $920 for the standalone. Uh, no, $720. So yeah, that's about $1,000. That's $800, I don't know why I said $1,000, I'm so distracted modeling. It's crazy to me when people don't factor in tax into the price of stuff they buy, as if they weren't gonna pay tax, like, what the hell bro. It's just really funny. Yeah, you gotta keep in mind 15% tax where I live, that's the sales tax. Honestly, I kinda like it. I think this looks good. 15, not 15. And it's on most things. I'm not sure if it's on like medicine, but I think it's on food. So that leads to bunny brushwoods, and I need the transition here to be an option. So let's get a proper dirt tax check here, and not this garbage. Yeah, Canadians don't. Including the price, it's just a European thing, I'm pretty sure. And I mean, I guess it makes sense for businesses, but if you're not a business, then like, what the fuck. What's it with soda bottles when Mario starts running? That's Lila's influence. Well, okay, I shouldn't, I shouldn't talk shit. It's because there was a fix to the export programming that unfortunately also introduced a bug, and it causes the random one to be wrong. Which means there's only an NA thing, pretty sure the rest are total crits tax. Yeah, it was similar to before. We had the footsteps. Do any of you guys keep fish? I want to talk about fish. Let me donate me about the path that is cut on the mountain is very similar to the wall. What about the stink floor texture? There is a good chance that there will be. What I'm doing is not the final version. I'm just getting something like semi decent going. So then when Biobak starts working on this, he has a good starting point. Amazon will this tariff cost next to the price? And that's really funny. That would be so detrimental to their business. They wouldn't do that. You have to fish. Let's fucking go. What are they? Bro, Jeffy boy was at Trump's graduation. Like, no way he would do that to him. They are bros. They're going to be like, do it. Don't you remember when you were at my graduation? Like we had such a good time. There was free food. There were. I cannot continue this joke. That would get me banned off Twitch. I can't. I can't find the meme. No, it's good. It's good. Having input is always good. Okay. I think this is a beautiful dirt texture. I like it. I want the path here. Something pathy. You have a small size black and orange fish. Is it a goldfish? The small size black and orange fish. That sounds like a goldfish. Or is it a koi? Is it a fancy goldfish? You have to have a small shark like a cat shark. It's going to die in the tank though. You need like thousands of liters. What if you had like the fish room and it was just a waterproof room that's like slightly flooded. And that's where your fish lives. And like you put planks above the room so you can still use it as like your living room. Maybe a glass floor. But you can also go swim in it. That would be banger. And it'd be like an indoor pool. Okay, actually, why don't you just have an indoor pool? Dude, an indoor pool would be so cool. If I had two billion dollars, I would have an indoor pool in my house. Do you think billionaires have like the roller coaster room? Do you think they have one? Like a room that's just a roller coaster? I would have one. But then again, I'm not boring. So of course I would have one. This is shit. What's the link in general? Let's see. Okay. This is a little difficult because in my game, it's supposed to be kind of like a river that goes through the entire island. So it's not that simple. But it's also more like a bay, right? It's not quite like this. Why don't you do a transformer? I will, but that's not what I'm doing right now. We're getting a path here.  I could do this. Like so. Transparent on top of the thing. That might just be the best option. Hello? Why can I not make the thing? There we go. It's solvable. It is solvable. I found the solution. We do this. Okay. I'm liking how the island is shaping up, but my design could be a lot better. Yeah, you're probably right. We're still working on it. Hello, Agirof. I love your shaders. They're pretty good, aren't they?  I have never heard of Battalion Wars, no. Sounds potentially cool, though. Would you like a free cycle mod? Yes. You can already fake a free cycle mod by doing some CPU combining stuff. It's not terrible. How is that, huh? How do you like that? How do you like that, Obama? Sorry, that was unfunny. I was just referencing a meme. Just referencing a meme by itself is not humor. I apologize on behalf of myself. So, you've done meme therapy and you're repeating the lessons to stop yourself. Maybe I have. Would that be so bad? What is this shit? Oh, that's what this shit is. Well, something dark like this catch the player's attention? Or would it not? Like, as in it stands out because it is so dark? Or is it more like it's so dark therefore no one will look at it? This feels like something I should know. I don't know. I don't know. Huh. Oh. What happened? When did I fuck this up? I can't use the packed geometry normals yet because they're not supported in LVP yet. At least to my knowledge. Okay, I need to do this thing from there. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I think this works. Are you using the same rock texture just so the N64 doesn't have to load one more texture in memory? No, honestly it's just laziness and I think it looks fine. So you're just bleaching the whole, just put a sign out front of some sort? Wait, what? I don't understand, why do you want a sign in front of here? Let's check how this looks. Looks pretty good from here. Oh, but there is a big issue on the floor. What's going on here? Okay, that's a fast 64 bug. It's not reverting the random ones, right? Nothing I can do about that. Using the sign as yellow paint, that's the case I need to be. Even though I don't know what I can't transition the mess. I think this is very easy to see and also there's going to be a character in front of this that's like, I'm not letting you in. There's absolutely no way anyone's going to miss this. I'm also going to put bunny footsteps in front of it. Now let's go back to that coconut idea someone had earlier. I think the coconut idea is funny as hell. What if there's like a palm tree with a coconut on it and you can kick it and it's going to fall on someone's head? It should be something like that. Like we just put coconuts on the trees and they can come to you or people around you. I think it's a cute idea. It was you? Ah. Yeah, not. The question is, who would you bother with that? Maybe someone who's sleeping and he will only wake up if you conk him with a coconut? They might be from Mario Kart DS. They're very ancient models. I mean, these are like 2020. Probably have to update them. I think I don't like that the path looks like this. I think the correct thing is like so. That's way better. You can just have coconuts on all the trees that break open and drop coins when you kick them. Hmm. I like that. Let's note that down. Part one. Well, actually, I'm just going to just in general. All the coconut trees have coconuts. You can kick them to make them drop the coconuts that may have 0 to 5 coins in them. Some sleeping character you can conk with a coconut. Yeah, we can also do that. If it's Mario, he takes damage. Whenever you conk palms, there's a higher risk of getting conked and you can use this as a clue to conk the palm tree. The proposed character is sleeping and has to wake them up. Well, you would see the coconuts earlier and you would probably at some point throughout the game, either accidentally or on purpose, make a coconut fall and that would be your hint. Maybe Shadow Bow. Let's get the bunny footprints. Okay. This is the texture I want. Right here. That definitely looks like bunny paws. Should work. Don't tell me it's an IA-8. That would be so embarrassing. It's an IA-8. They should be longer. Defeat? I see. You're gonna make me a new one? Alright. This is a game you've worked on. This one? Before that last impact, I guess. Nine years ago? Oh my god. Okay. So. I actually do want... Actually, let's work on this side. Because a lot of people were saying the scent looks bad. Let's try to get a new color for the scent. Because it's gonna be necessary for the next step. Well, this is surely not what anyone wants. Are you thinking something... Meh.   Beach scent. Beach sandals? Beach scent! Google! It's very orange. But we can try to recreate this color. Like this? Reserves the ability to add rain where we want it. Yeah, something like this. Because we also want there to be grass on the island. So I think it needs to be something more like that. And then we can transition it into grass like over here maybe. Okay. I think I would like there to be some amount of grass here. On the hill. Or maybe just later into the island. Maybe everything past here should be sandy. Have grassy. Am I distracting? Is the sky being a winter sky? The sky is very temporary. It's not actually gonna be there. It's just there so that our eyes don't bleed when we look at the horizon.  Actually, this could work maybe. Let's try it. Grass is so easy to make. Grass is just noise.  Looks absolutely putrid, disgusting, awful. I don't know. That's not enough to get off the sand. Makes it look like a windswept dune in a desert. Okay, I see what you mean. Yeah, I think you might have a fair point. Okay. I can look into it in a second. Okay. Seems like a very Yoshi color. Let's see what Zayna sent me. Oh, I see. I need multiple of them in a path, Zayna. Can you put like maybe four or five of them on one texture? I don't have a decade-long release cycle. I started this game like at the end of 2020. And Last Impact was made in two years. So, it's just that I didn't work on the big game in the meantime. What size? How about 128x32? Well, there is no release date yet. So, like, what do you want me to do? I don't know when it releases. It gets done when it's done.  Let's see. We're thinking the dark parts are too dark. I think that may be fair. Let me make the dark parts a bit lighter.  Coming 2017. It didn't even start working then. I guess I'm just buying my Switch on Beaches. The green, like I'm seeing here, tends to be high up above the waterline. I see. Maybe we have to move it high up then. But I think you may be right. Not gradients. Where's curves? Where is curves? Ah, here. Permission denied. I was saying, can you, like, slightly, like, randomly rotate them and stuff like that? Them all being in an order like that doesn't really seem like how they would work, you know? Okay. Okay. This seems so not juicy. Okay. I'm just back to the previous color. This looks so depressing. Looks good, Zeina. I will try that in a bit. Okay. Okay. That's alright. The way the grass and the sand is a bit not gonna lie, maybe add some spots of grass and the sand to make it pop off. Oh my god, I just started! Calm down! I have no time yet! Chill.  Chill. Yeah, I don't know what you guys want me to do. I can't do, like, 15 things at the same time. Obviously it's not going to be finished the second I start. Okay.  Ugh. Okay. I don't know! Are you alert by video game pro times better content? Nope. And no, I didn't look at the Giga League. Not because I didn't want to. I did kind of want to look at it because that is, like, hella views. But because of the legal implications. Uh, whoops. Okay. Um... Okay, I guess I do it this way around then. That was weird. Okay. Wait, no. It needs to be here. I don't know how I keep messing this up. Okay. Okay, I need to turn this around. This is a bad idea, I'll forget this. Shit. Wait. Now I remember what I wanted to do. Oh my god, this was supposed to be normal sand. That's the issue. Good, there's none of it. There we go.  Let's get these here. That's better. Problem solved. Sand, plus, sine, grass, duplicate, grass trans, sine, layer 6, shade color, no-op and transparent decal. Like this one. Go along the line. Make this zero. There we go. That was kind of the idea. And then we probably also need to make the grass less successful near the rim here. Because realistically, the grass would be dying near the rim. Well, I don't think black is the right solution, but maybe it looks better. Heh. Oh, why is it on the alpha layer? Oh, wrong. There we go. So now it affects it. Something like this. Texture's too big. I4, I4, I4, I4. Sand is too big? Right, because it's H2 sand texture. So it is a dumb question, but can you do static light mapping, or would the server texture be too much for every server for a full game? You can only have one UV mapper, I think. So if you did have a light map, it would have to have the same UVs, and that's so limiting that in practice you can say it can't do it. I think this looks neat. Minus the sand UV mapping issues there. Very Banjo-Kazooie. Yeah, I find the sand color very difficult to get right. You have a point. I'm not 100% solid on the sand color either. You might also want to raise all this a little bit, just because one person said that that's typically how it would be in real life. Like this would all be raised slightly, and I think that's fair. Yeah. Yeah. I should have more of a shell fossil in the cliff texture, like the Yoshi galaxy. That could be fun. But it does cause problems. Export bug. Don't worry about it. Why you're not using proportional editing to move the cave is just because proportional editing will move it by a small amount of coordinates in some places, and that will draw my coordinate grid off, and that would be a huge issue considering how I need the UVs or the vertices to align perfectly for this whole thing to work. Because decals need to be on the exact same coordinates. Otherwise they will not work. Like you see just now, I moved that, and then ruined the vertex color here. Okay, I think we're getting there. Now I want to just make this blue again. I think we need to subdivide this hill here for it to work correctly. That should be fine. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Someone told me that the way to tell if a song is good is if you can hum along to it, and I think they were almost 100% of the money. The real test to see if a song is good is to see if you can meow along to it. What did I miss? What about literally changing the overlap, like in between an area unlocking here, have a treasure chest, wash up on the beach with Gold Sam or a big flower grove, eventually bloom. That's exactly how it works. The overworld changes throughout the game. It's supposed to feel alive. Okay. I'm not throwing up, which is good. I initially had the idea that the music would slowly add instruments and become happier, but that doesn't seem to be in the realms of what's going to happen anymore. All right. I'm not sure what you mean by a 90 degree angle here, but I think it would make sense as a dune if we put some plants on here and make this a little grassy. That would work. You mentioned there also being a sandy transition to the top here, for example. I like the rock. I want another rock. The rock is cool. There. The rock is cool. Now we have to rock. Shit, rock, yeah. Sometimes you just have to go with what your heart desires, you know? That's what game design is all about. I feel like I want the rock, so I'm going to make a rock. It's a small rock. I'm fine with a small rock. Do you guys think that the increase in fidelity that games in general have received has inevitably taken away something that makes games special in the same way that taking a picture doesn't feel as special as drawing a painting of something, specifically because you don't cartoonize certain elements of it and put special attention to certain elements for the sake of making the player feel something? Well, yeah, the full-screen warping effect when the camera is underwater like an oily boiled egg, I don't know what's wrong. I could, but honestly, I don't really see that working. Maybe. Oh, I love this rock. It's not even just about realistic, it's about fidelity. You know how in Banjo-Kazooie, all the characters are like... Like, that has something to it, that when you voice act, it's not there. Sorry for being loud. I didn't mean to be so loud in Banjo-Kazooie. I just realized pink graphics, but it couldn't run. That's crazy. Art definitely became less horrendous as it ended as that effect of graphics became less horrible. PS1 Spyro looks crazy for what it is. Dude, this coordinate grid is so annoying. No, it's still there. I unchecked that, but it's still there. Where is it? How do I get rid of it? There's a thing in Autographic View. Is that floor? It is floor. Oh my god, this is so much nicer to look at. I don't know when it comes to photography, but gaming has gotten worse with the focus of higher graphics. There's one art piece I like, where someone has gotten so good at drawing paintings, that when they draw a painting, it just looks like the real thing, just like a photograph. And you look at that and it's like, what's the point? Why does this exist? You could have just taken a photograph and gotten the same thing. Sure, this is an amazing display of skill, and we have to appreciate the dedication and suffering that went into it. But no one cares, because you can't just take a photograph. And I think that's really cool that it exists. It's an art piece that makes you feel something. It makes you feel despair and suffering. It's similar to when you see a picture of Marco's rule, and you see him being buff as fuck and looks cool as fuck, but you know he's going to die early, because he sacrificed his entire life to get buff as fuck. And he's also not happy. He's suffering every single day, but dude, look at his muscles. That's cool. Yeah, but he shouldn't be. Against all odds. Am I clicking the bow and arrow? Oh, yeah, they are annoying. That's why I eat quark.  On the third stream topic, after politics and AI. Dude, we haven't talked about politics and AI all stream. And you come in here jinxing it like that?  If this stream devolves into politics and AI, then it's Biobak's fault. We are all allowed to blame Biobak for it. You know what? That was fine. I think we should take the conservators instead. It's a loosening. Black and white film era being gone. We lost something in Kentucky movies. Yeah. The Italian element is literally Mario. Like, what do you mean? I don't know.     I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  These rabbit feet. Sayonara, mate. After the overworld, there's still some side levels. Oh, cool! It's a fast 64 bug. Nothing I can do about it right now. Anyway, I think it's gonna look good once that bug is fixed. Will that trail just fade out or will it connect else to Tana entrance 2 from somewhere else? It's into a level. Does it look like bunny feet? I don't know. Maybe bunny feet are longer. Anyway, I'm done with stream for today. So, I will see you guys in the next stream, possibly on Thursday, but I'm not 100% certain. So, until then, bye bye! Bye, Raydee!
