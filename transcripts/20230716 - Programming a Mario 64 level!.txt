Hello, first, hello def, look at this fucking level I've been making off stream this week for the SimpleFlips competition. It currently doesn't render right because the areas are not visible from each other but that's gonna happen. But instead this will be the biggest level ever made on Mario 64. Oh I think I'm gonna die Yep that's just gonna be called only up 64 Oh Biggest level ever even like by a lot It's not even close It's gonna take like 25 minutes just to get to the top Look this is me with moon jump and speed up just going up This is definitely gonna be the level of all time It's not done yet this is like maybe 60% of the level finished so it's gonna be even bigger It's gonna be N64 compatible too I hope It is so warm today All right any OST wishes for today? That is the only up 64 mod where it's just a bunch of random assets Silent Pilly Yeah I'm literally gonna die from this f*****g heat oh my god The Numerican ADLC OST is already online Is that your song suggestion? Yeah So yeah I'm not sure what we have to program next let me just check this out Zeina made the animations for this guy already or most of them Oh right I did this off stream too the tox boxes look at them aren't they neat Yeah Yeah I still have to think of a way to make it so that Mario can't like move through the walls like this it's a bit difficult It's giving you an error you're trying to request an OSC how are you trying to request an OSC? Does it say it doesn't say it's only Roger Bay it says only Boily Bay It's also not oily ocean it's oily boily bay Yeah I like these a lot too Yeah big fan of the new tox boxes We could hide a Yoshi coin in one of them We also have a bunch of new collision codes You guys probably can't really tell the difference but it's very noticeable when you're walking into ceilings like this it's a lot more stable now Yes dingo that's actually a thing that happened to me I used to have this learning computer learning laptop thing with a few games on it and I don't remember what it was called Either way OST OST How about let's just go Mario Party 6 They are a lot more expressive I think they have like higher quality textures and all that I don't have an idea for the music yet and I thought Badub was gonna make him song but Badub's been missing in attendance for a bit so I'm not really sure what to expect there Is the laptop green and white? I have no idea I think this one was supposed to look spray-painted on too Oh my god our design document is getting long here we go so we got the cement pit guy The glass curry still need the animations Um there's an overseer when we wake up let's do the seesaw guy Should we we shouldn't put like Goombas with helmets too I think Goombas and Koopas are like too related to not have both Oh yeah this is the only up 64 level fucking massive hello B-Turk Dude Bowser loves statues of himself he has them everywhere Control F in your sections yeah that works too Will you ever consider remaking Mario's animations for running jumping etc? I am not a good enough animator to do that They would look worse if I did that Have you called it only one up? I don't know I'm not sure I think I want the cloud more than I want a neat name so only up 64 is just more cloud Also hello Bioware also news I found the low latency button on YouTube yeah YouTube just says a button that says low latency latency and big latency and I just had to click low latency so now we should have less stream delay That was a fucking wild button to put into a program but here we are My wife what my wife doesn't play Candy Crush what Fix the thing does it have culling and does it run well what the only up 64 I haven't actually tested it on 64 yet So Dude I love the remove lag button it's like the triple a slider in Unreal Engine so useful I always strike it all the way to the right All right guys you want to test the delay with me I'll count on from three and then you will all type an a into chat all right On zero you will type the a three two one zero Okay no one listened to me Wait yeah shit You type the ages now that means you still have like 10 seconds. Oh My god, you guys have so much delay. Are you actually all the way at the front of the video? That's like half a minute It's fucking devastating Did I not do it right There was a button that said like low latency and I pressed it YouTube's fucked So All right, I guess we have to live with this big delay that is not good Maybe I just have bad stream settings again The goomba looks good wood. That's because this is my goomba. It's not my 64's goomba Why is this an ia4, oh, I guess it looks the same He looks like he respects the osha regulations, well, I'm sure he would like them but you know boza is not really on board with them So Is the release date for your amazing games nope, just wait It's hard to predict when the release is gonna be So I hate that you can't switch to object mode anymore in the snow blender version I don't know why they would remove a feature like that It's a feature you need to use like every day The clown feet that's the goomba he looks like that Yeah, so I found a bunch of collision improvements which is very very neat So collision in this game is gonna hopefully be a little better I'm very happy with that um I think that's all I found while I was gone because I was working on only up. I also Have a presentation do it for like a tech conference Man i'm so busy actually I will never have my freedom Try tweaking the bit rate You want me to have like a worse quality to like try and reduce the lag, I don't know about that So So the plan here is to have a guy on a seesaw And the guy's gonna be at the front of the seesaw and there's maybe like a box behind them and if you break the box the seesaw just falls over and he like lands down here and he's just upset Do we actually have breakable boxes in this game I haven't used breakable boxes in so long The new star video and the brand new ship. Why did I hear the boss team from vanilla mario 64? What you heard the vanilla theme? You should not have what are you sure you heard the vanilla mario 64 boss theme? Because I don't think that's a thing in my game So Let me see no bit rate is actually fine I am fine with the word bit rate no beef So Video qualityness, you know what that is fine, too So Now bin rate means bits per second it's perfect word Why do you stream on case clips and not like case what's or even the main channel Uh case watts is probably dead forever And I stream on case clips because we have 10 000 subs here and we have a thousand on case watts And I don't want to stream on the main channel because this is not really the content that fits it I don't want to ruin my algorithm, you know I also don't want to get a million comments from people that barely care about the game My streams here and they are like all about the game if you get entertained that's a side effect I just care about making a good game Oh shit, that's Actually, is that sad or neat Biobak? It's neat for me sad for you. This is that fair assessment of the situation So I mean the cool thing about my case clips channel here Is that I can just upload whatever the fuck I want and I don't really care if that fucks my algorithm or not I just do what I want and I like that This dude is not walking at all Because I don't have bills to pay here. Oh That's definitely an advantage Is what's your opinion on this comment hashtag if delete file is true delete the file That's something that you should be able to just read from the code And that is a very stupid comment to put into a quote The code itself is better documentation than your documentation so you should remove your documentation Oh shit, we need to talk about cash Honestly, uh, I could pay you a little bit from the youtube money but like my youtube channel Is barely profitable, especially now that brilliant doesn't sponsor me anymore kind of back to square zero Lila you asked me for my opinion. Okay, and I gave you my opinion. What what did you expect? So Okay, that's currently disgusting but with the same effect i'm going to make it pretty You earned 10k a month from hat in time what's now I wish I don't know if i'm actually allowed to say how much i'm paying at my job That doesn't spell any sponsoring anymore the deal just ran out we had a deal for six videos and i've made my six videos And that's it now all right the Goomba looks good apart from you know, if you have things going on there They probably just figured hey we got all the ads that we wanted out of this channel Let's just move on and find a new guy to make the videos for us Is a wrong config part, yeah, I don't know how to fix that unlucky No, like I don't know if my workplace would want me to share my salary I know the FBI is not gonna catch me I Actually kind of like my boss. So if my boss said he is uncomfortable with me sharing my salary, then I wouldn't share it, you know Or if he just says he would prefer not to I know that sorry like talking about that. It's like a weird thing a lot of people I don't really give a fuck but like I know that it's weird for many people Tells you how to fix the error in the message Okay, I'm lucky for it I don't know what that means I Don't know what there is any other chance I if then in the UK that's the thing we do all the time So I don't know what's like your country I Mean I work for a company in Denmark and all the people are like all over the world. So I have no idea I I Not this fucking song I remember this song played for like an hour and stream once I Skip it. Okay, you can put emotes here I Have you guys seen the weird tick-tock lives They've seen some of that like on Twitter two days ago and that shit was actually hilarious I Don't like this texture actually I Feel like what doesn't even make any sense it should be metal I Did I wish I was born like 10 years later so I could become one of those tick-tock livestream us I Okay, okay I am They are really stupid And I don't know why people watch them But the fact they are around like at all is amazing to me I Got them finding a texture is difficult. Maybe this one works if I Move it a bit around Yeah, yeah, I like this plank Yeah, I'm protein powder, hmm So, you know what I'm talking about Is it one of those tenets and you only say Philemon Philemon Ramos goes a room room PC part I What if I just started doing that like right now for the next two hours This is gonna be all the content for today I'm gonna do it like this and then I cut it like that And then I add an extra layer here and then I make this black And then we use a Gaussian blur A Yeah, that looks good to me Also f3 so far the trailers I've gotten they are really cool This might become a pretty hype f3 again One game so far I won't say what it is, but it's a game for calculators And it's my favorite one so far a calculator game Yeah, that should work And It's not doomed No one would actually want to play doom on a calculator Doom on a calculator would be like a novelty item. There wouldn't be anything anyone's actually interested in Do not talking okay Abdullatif what is wrong? Who is do not talking me you telling me to shut up There's a Smash Bros TI calculator part that is cool to But actually the thing I am having is arguably even more hype than that Yes, Abdallah is telling me to shut the fuck up what's up that last problem You Anything on a calculator is a novelty item. I don't think so. I Think if you are in school anything on a calculator is fucking amazing because you can just play it in school I Actually, yeah, I mean it's a novelty but it's also like a useful thing, you know, I think there's still a distinction You Super Mario 64 calculator port actually, that's probably possible already. I Wouldn't be surprised if that existed Technically speaking PCs are also just calculators, aren't they? Okay, so if you can't use your phone in the classroom, that's honestly a skill issue Okay, look Lila when I was in school, I didn't even have a phone That's what you're gonna do with the phone in class Okay, something is wrong with Abdullatif Okay Okay, boom I'm not a boomer fam. I still have it in me I Don't say this TI 83 and 84. That's the one I had Oh God Is he playing Fox He is playing Fox Wait, this is me Lido. This is not just Smash for 64 This is actually me Lee You can play it multiplayer over link that is so cool What is my opinion on the word risk I Mean think about that one. I Think that's just like a reinvention of the word game or charm That my generation the zoom us the young people us Are using to distinguish us from the old people that the boomers that still say game or charm Charm, if you say charm, you're probably a grandpa I Give the correct answer. Let's get you to bed Shit y'all tough today so disrespectful I It's me charisma charisma, oh that's what resist I knew that of course cuz I'm young I Mean this looks pretty good So we're gonna make it so that if you will ground-pump this The whole thing just kind of falls off the top Although now that I think about it, you should probably also be able to ground-pump this I Am honestly not sure about the metal sound anymore. I Think the metal sounds weird in some contexts I'm not sure if I like this Oh, we actually still have space for I think five sound step games some steps In the game. So if we want we can add more I Drew a fish Yeah, there are no moves like this one or this one or this one No, I like this, I mean maybe we'll change it I have to see you put the hat right now I kind of just want to design a few elements of this level and then we see how it all works together It's in a river back to chart, yeah. Yeah, that was just in a crying you hurt She does that sometimes she just runs through the How do you call that area I It's not a circumcised fish, I don't think you can circumcise fish I don't even know if it's fish have a dick to begin with Great, yes, God has no autocomplete. We need a bigger arrow for drawing. Nope, that's all I get. We still didn't get fat, heavy skin. I'm just taking myself a whole here. Okay. I have no idea what you're talking about. It might actually. That's a good idea, yeah. Like I said, we also have three more sounds we could add. We have glass added as well already. All right. Well, luckily Project 64 is here to save the day. Just use Project 64. I am done supporting Parallel Launcher. I hate it. Frame buff emulation impeaches fury. The game runs on N64. It should run just fine with frame buff emulation. No, my own mods are not shown in F3. That would be silly to showcase them. Okay. QPC can't run Project 64? That is a skin issue. All right. Okay. All right. I have no problem with that, but if someone wants to move on from it, then they're on their own. I'm not helping you. Is this meant to be a factory making airship parts or just an all right currency with the lore? It was supposed to be like Bozo's Fleet Factory at first, but it slowly became just like the place where they tank up, I guess. I'm not even sure if you're going to see airships here later. You're definitely going to see Bozo being mad that Mario destroyed his airships though. Okay, let me make sure that this still renders fine. No crashes. Having an interconnected world is okay. I don't hate on it, but I think it's nicer if the worlds are like separate and the interconnectedness comes from the overworld alone. Having it the way Banjo-Tooie did it means you add a lot of backtracking and I don't like that. Oh, whoops. You have never played RomEx before? Damn. But I get how watching playthroughs of RomEx could be fun. So maybe it's all of the inventory, because there's some RAM left over. There's a lot of RAM left over. I spread my RAM thin because that's kind of more optimal for loading times from the memory. But, you know, it doesn't really make that much of a difference. You could just squish it back together. Okay, this should be the perfect version. And then next time we'll make it so that we can move the seesaw and then we'll move these objects here. Do I think I could do what? Detect RAM ranges and more RAM optimal layout? I don't think the game fits into 4 megabytes. At least not right now. If we loaded Aria separately and we loaded all the codes separately, we could probably make this game work with 4 megabytes of memory. But that's a lot of extra work for very little extra game. I wouldn't support Project 64 simply because of that pop-up.  Does this mod make use of the expansion pack? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Oh, AngleValPitch doesn't exist. What? It does. Did I misspell it? Yeah, what? Oh, I misspelled it. What are we going to use? I use an MK typist. It's a very, very standard keyboard. But it's mechanical. I heard it's better. I haven't really noticed the difference. Well, this doesn't seem to do anything. That's not good. Dude, parallel launcher users are like the Linux users of the Mario 64 hacking world. Exact same thing. Oh, I forgot to increment the action. People told me I can type faster with it. That's why I use it. Have I made the glass star? You mean this one here? This is what I tried to do. Like, I don't know how much I like it. But that's kind of the glass star. Yeah, but Lina still sounds like a Linux user right now. All right, so this is the opposite of what I wanted, but it's pretty close. That looks bad lol. It does. I am aware. How many stars have I made? Like 80, maybe? I don't know. I think it could be better. I kind of just have it as a test and right now no one's complained about it yet so far. Oh, this looks kind of smooth. Wait, Lina, do you mean that this looks bad or that the star looks bad? I have so much delay that I can barely tell. I think I want this effect to be a lot stronger. You want me to make the transparent star to look the same as the normal one with the eyes closed? Nah, that's awful. It looks way too misleading. I don't like that at all. It should look used up. Why is the Goomba having a seizure? That's because his animations are not there. So the matrices he gets right now, I just ran the matrices that I left over in memory. If I just did, like, vgInitAnimation0, this would instantly stop. Well, a lot of this is real physics. Transparent star, like in the original, but with closed eyes like it's sleeping. It doesn't have eyes in the original. You want me to add closed eyes? That would look really weird for the star on the floor. That would be really neat for normal stars, though. I can see that. I wish I had autocomplete. You want to try something? All right. We are excited for that. What? How can that be? Let me try that again. Make the red coin star spawn. The red coin star spawn does look a bit weird, like originally, but a glass cage? I don't know about that one. Ah, okay. I see the issue. On second thought, I do not see the issue. Oh, wait, what? That's weird that it even compiled. That flash draws a metal eye, got the metal eye effect. That would be a random. There, he's no longer breakdancing. I'm thinking what you have to do here is destroy this box here. As soon as you destroy the box, it's just going to fall over forwards and the Goomba is going to be all sad. Maybe he should just get flattened by this thing here. How funny would it be if he just got stuck below the thing? You know what I mean? Wait. What if this just happened to him, the Goomba? I want that to happen. Okay. Okay. This should probably not be here, now that I think about it. Alright, let's try this out. I just simply like an Asmongold Reborn with red coins instead of yellow particles. Okay that looks neat, but I think doing that with red coins would look really weird. Also, I want the player to be able to tell beforehand when the star is going to appear. There are some levels that are already designed with that in mind, so we do need a marker. His life is in my hands! Long live the king! Oh nevermind, I have no influence on this. Maybe this is a bit much. Let's try it like this. How do you test features as you implement them? I don't, I just assume they work. I want the player to be able to stop it from falling while Mario is still on there. And then obviously as soon as it's past a certain point, it will just spin out of control. Like that's when it starts falling forward I guess. Now what's stopping me from being able to... Well I guess this number is too big. The box doesn't look particularly breakable. Yeah, that is an issue actually. This box isn't used in many levels either, so that would be hard to tell. You're at my mercy now Goomba boy! And this is a whole separate issue. Alright, let's start making this fall. So I gotta make sure that this behavior is as predictable as possible for the code. So that we can actually make it fall down properly and onto his head. Or we could say fuck it and program it properly. Yeah, let's do that. It shouldn't be too hard. So how high up is the floor actually? Let me just export this real quick. To find out how high the floor is. I mean Mario is a perpetual mobility to begin with. Physics thought it impossible, but it's right there in Mario 64. You just grab a Bob-omb. Without affixing the issue it might be a good idea. Thank you Layla for your input. Should it be cosine or should it be sine? It should be sine. Does any of the others know I'm gonna burn? Actually maybe with Bowser and all. Yeah, maybe. I don't know yet. Why are you keeping a copy of the blank right next to itself? Am I? Oh, one is the collision model. Doesn't really make much sense when they're the same, but it's a habit. It's not disadvantaged yet. Don't crash my PC so the glass starts being delayed. Oh no. That is not good at all actually. That's terrible. I was thinking, was there something else I needed to show you guys? I had a playtest happen on Course 2 in Return to Yoshi's Island. We've made some changes there. Warming Canada is very warm in Canada. It's insufferable. How will I detect whether the Goomba is squished properly? I'm not sure yet. I don't know. Dude, I should have made Releasio 4 for the Simplest Troll competition. Why didn't I do that? And also, where's this crash? Well, it has to be in this function here. What did I do that even has the potential to cause a crash like that? How's this the PC? The object list array? Oh, I know what I did. I exported the test behavior to find out where the floor is. And then I just jumped to some undefined code. In the 110s? You're being cooked alive? You're being boiled? 95 degrees. Oh, Fahrenheit. The engine is stable. It's just that I put a behavior that's not actually a behavior. I forgot to actually move the thing. So that happened. I don't know. I feel like there is a function that's a combo of these two. How is there not? That's fucked up. I know I still have time, but I don't care. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. They're baking bread in their mailbox? Goodbye. Okay, we can make that better. But that looks fucking hilarious. It is a smart woman. It. Okay, but that doesn't really help. Like, I don't need Fahrenheit to tell you that like, oh, maybe below 18 is getting kind of cold for some reason.            Below 13 is cold for most people. Like 25 is getting hot. Like, you get a feeling for that. How does one being 0 and the other being 100 really help here? It doesn't. Like, think about human size. They are not neatly aligned to 0 and 100. But you know, like, oh, 5 foot 4 is kind of short for a guy. 6 foot 2 is kind of tall. 50 feels cooling fine. What's the conversion again? Like, minus 32 and then divided by 1.8 or something? So that's like 10 degrees Celsius. I don't think it's about what you learn in school. I think it's just what you have around you. What the fuck is a foot even? It's like the thing on the bottom of your leg. It's exactly 25.24 centimeters. 30.24 centimeters long. If your foot is not 30.24 centimeters long, you are a misconstruction. A failure of a human being. Get the check that. Why is it called imperial? Is America like an imperium? What is this?  We are Star Wars IRL. Yep, that's America. I like to see someone walk with their meat is true. OK, that kind of works. Do you guys see the new collision? You see how stable that is? Mario 64 would never be able to handle this. Like a surface like this in Mario 64 is deadly and would never work correctly. I love this. Oh my God, I'm so good at games. You see that? Sorry, I got a bit hyped. That's exactly what I'm planning to do. I'm just working on... I'm going to have it fall forward and then I'm going to have it bounce, bounce, bounce and I'm going to have it slowly squish him down. Surfaces are all defined based on triangles. Why does it do this? Oh, wait. That's why. Does I have space to squish a Goomba? Yeah, and a Goomba shouldn't easily be squished under there. Man. Okay, what if we just invert the speed and do nothing else? This should now rotate forever, but back and forth. What the fuck? All right, all right, all right. All right, I see a few issues. The problem is that, yes, the thing accelerates so fast that it doesn't really have a chance to properly fall over. So instead what we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have it fall forward like this and then just spin more time. And it's not gonna actually change the angle of our pitch here, it's just gonna keep rotating that way, which is maybe a bit more realistic anyway. And then we just need to make the Goomba fall in front of it. So we might be getting a bit too much for console. It's gonna be rough. But if this is too much for console, we can still easily break this apart because like all this red coin section here, we could just put this into a separate area and it wouldn't be a big loss. But we could just have a pipe that leads there and then on the other hand we have a pipe that leads from there. So that, you know, that would be an option. Maybe we should test it on N64 one more time. All right, I have the perfect way to do this. And then we have this set to something like that. I think this is gonna be good now. We just need to make the Goomba fall in front. We only need to fake it well enough that no one notices that it's fake. See I feel like everyone would notice this. I need to move a little more forward but after that I think it would work. And it also got too slow. Oh yeah, I have a new system for N64 that makes it so that only some areas have the nuke clip ratio which should hopefully make it so that we can... Oh okay, that was pretty good. I think I like this. Apart from, you know, going into the wall there. It needs a bit of a speed boost when it lands here. Other than that, this works. And it's too slidey. So let's get this back to 1.5. The hack is coming along pretty well, I would say. Okay, there's no guarantee that it will work on N64 when we test it in a second, but it might. Well, that was not the intention. Needs a bit more bounce. I can add a bit of bounce. Actually no, I will not add a bounce. Get it, physics? Physics is maybe a bit of a generous word for this. It's more like an animation. Alright, that's a bit too much speed, but other than that... Yeah, let's slow this down more. Or faster, rather. Will you add a sound when the board hits the floor? We can add a sound. For some reason, VS Code will no longer do that. Sound general mental bounce seems good to me. Dude, I just realized, why doesn't Robot submit Cursed Mirror to F3? Actually, he already was in there last year. Okay, that's perfect, animation-wise. I don't know why there was the no sound, though. Let's try this one. It's a real-time simulation physics for the YouTube clip, namely. Yep, Biobak understands the assignment. That's how it works. Undefined reference to Cure OBJ plays sound? Well, that explains that. There's a metal... Oh, the meme sound. Alright, boys and girls. Girls too? Girls can stay? Boys and girls, let's test this on N64. So there's basically a 50% chance the game won't boot. So we just have to hope for the best. Oh, wow. Weird angle at the end. That angle is on purpose, because the Goomba's gonna be squished below it. That might be a weird audio. Oh, shit. Floating point exception 8024401C in ClipMario. It's actually a function I've edited, so if there's a floating point exception here, this might be a real bug I need to fix. Oh, this is 0. I see. Okay, let me fix this in only UP64 as well. Because this is in two repos now. This is why I hate having two repos, because now I need to fix this in two places at once. So basically the error was a division by zero there. And unfortunately Project64 does not tell you when you have a division by zero. Where's your shirt? Fucked up thing. I got robbed. They took all my shirts. Well, it's got an SD drive to use, and it works. I honestly just bought a random one. Sorry Mario, you don't need safety checks? You don't. Most of the time you don't. Safety checks are for weenies. Okay, imagine if I had safety checked that, and never realized that there was a bug to begin with. Wouldn't that be a worse outcome? It would be. Hello Black Ferrari. It might still not work. Same function? Did I not compile? Ah. And surely there's like an epsilon. Ah, 0.01f. Okay. Alright, let's do that one again. Fullscreen please? Okay, I will give you fullscreen. I will please you. But Windows Power Toys has a universal color picker, it's so useful. Wait, you can like pick a color out of any program? Like off your screen? That is kind of useful. Oh. Alright, next attempt. Whatcha doing? We are gonna test our level here on an N64 to make sure that we don't go way over our polygon budget. Or our performance budget. There is a chance it still won't boot. What? Okay, did I? I did compile. What the fuck? I was so sure I would have fixed that. Okay, let's go into the code and see what's wrong. 0.024. Def.s. Okay. Floating parameters. Oh, you see this? You see this shit here? This is insane. Okay, let me tell you what's going on here. Basically, the compiler decided that right here, where I want to avoid the division by 0. It is going to pipeline the division into the delay slot of my branch. So that no matter what happens, I always divide by 0. That's not a bug in the code. That is not my fault. So I need to move some of these computations into new slots like this. And then hopefully, by doing it this way around, I can avoid that happening. Um. Clipback. There we go. You should tell EZSpy about that one. I don't think there's anything EZSpy can do about this. Why does project 6480 divide by 0? Because it's not a very accurate emulator. Project 64 doesn't give a fuck. Definitely a GCC moment. Okay, so you have some requests. I did enable some requests on donations. Unless I messed up, it should be there. I did look into all the YouTube notification stuff. There's unfortunately no way for me to test if it works. But if I did everything right, it will work. Okay, if we're lucky, it's no longer pipelining the division by 0 unconditionally into the delay slot. Hey! Playing on this has so much input lag, you guys have no idea. Okay. Oh! Who was that? Oh, hmm. Okay. Some angles on this level don't do too well. But most of this level still seems to work fine for me. Is it a streamlabs donation link on Twitch or do I click something else? No it's streamlabs. Wait do I- I don't have a donation link down there do I? Yeah this is a pretty rough angle, 22 fps, well like what would we be expecting I mean. Also keep in mind we didn't optimize anything at all yet, like literally nothing. Show the cement pit? Alright let's try the cement out on real n64. Dude it's so unplayable with this input lag, I feel like a toddler. Oh that looks clean. I don't really have any ideas for performance improvement stuff, like how do we fix the performance here? Because 20 fps kinda sucks. What's that donation? Oh what's up? Yeah so about that background, don't worry about it, that's just like a thing with the drawing distance. You don't think the donation went through? No? What was the song? Just DM it to me. You know what just post it in chat, maybe that's how we do it. Sorting, right, we still need to z-sort, right I still need to sort the bowser model in front of all this shit here. Although most of that stuff is like layer 4. The easiest possible optimization I could do is to enable backface scaling on all the metal stuff. That would improve performance by so much but it would look a little bit shittier. I don't know if that's worth it. Nice song better. Slower moving objects, how does that help? That is a crazy suggestion. I mean so much of this level just works so well FPS wise. Actually there's one thing I need to check, I have 23 FPS right now. Limiting the FPS spec kind of improves them. Yeah there's a lot of poppin but the poppin removing that is not gonna significantly affect lag. The only lag really happens is like when you're here and you're looking at like the big area. Oh this is a rough view. What's that music? That's a song request. Someone asked to play the song. That's just draw distance issues. Yeah what can we do about this? We kind of need something to do about this. I don't think there's any N64 game of this scale that performs like even close to this polygon count wise. How many polys does this level have now? 13,000! Okay there's also the text here though. The text might add something to it. Okay that's 6,000 without the text. No lots are not good. Wie cool ist das bitte? Is that what you're trying to reference? And in fact there's actually no collision distance. I don't think fog is an optimization actually. Okay if we removed fog from this level it would run a lot better. There's also still a few of these which if we remove that it's gonna be slightly better. Struggle is hilarious. It is hilarious. Scale down a level. Changing the scale isn't gonna change anything. It's the amount of like pixels that are being rendered. Also the fact that when you're looking from here none of this is backface culled. Like how many is this? That's like a thousand two hundred triangles that are not being backface culled. If we were fine with turning on backface culling on these it would look like this which is a good chunk worse right? Like comparatively. I think this is just worse but I think that would already fix all the performance issues. Guys fog would make this level worse. It would run worse. I mean it already has fog. Wait but fog made the player run the whole level? Like you only wandered around the player and then the rest of the level has no fog? It would just be clearly visible? You prefer that? You prefer this look? How? Yo BF2 thank you for becoming a member. You now have the Yoshi egg. It is very cool. But backface culling was enabled far away. That is possible yes. Alright let's turn on backface culling and test the level again. Worst we could get just now was like 19 FPS. I'm gonna compile, try again and then we see the FPS difference. I think it is gonna be like 25 now. It's a lot less mid. I'm thinking maybe it should only be that on N64. But I'm not sure actually. I got an angle with lots of scaffolds in front of each other. Like this? I don't know. Another sub? What was that? Yeah I'm thinking. This is me thinking. I think. I think a lot but I'm thinking. We should turn on backface culling on N64 only. I think that is the play. My controller is not working. What? No it's just booted the loudest sound possible on N64? I'm so glad I turned it off before I heard anything. It's a fucking wild ROM to accidentally boot on stream. Alright that's already a lot better. At least it feels a lot better. And it also looks better on N64 I agree actually. So this was like 22 I think. Now it's 29. 28. That's almost perfect up to here. So this was 19. 25. Dude, I predicted this exact number. That's a lot better. And I still have the limit FPS option. That might improve this even more. Yeah, still 25. Honestly this game is playable at 25. I am not even sure if normal players will ever notice that it's not 30. I actually prefer the without backface calling version on emulator, but on N64 I can see how this looks better. I think the backface visibility is gonna be an emulator only thing here. There's also still a lot of optimization to do with like the undersides of these. I don't know if we need all of them. A lot of these could probably be just like deleted. Because you would never actually see them in gameplay. Like the underside of the platform I'm on right now, how would you see that in gameplay? Yo, thank you for the 5 bonus for the Koopa oil crew. Right here with their glowing hats. Oh god. Weee. What is that? What is that? What is that? What is that sound? Oh, that's your donation. Is there only two options? Nope. On N64 it will automatically default to no backface calling here. Let's see if there's other triangles we can just remove. Surely there will be a lot. Keep in mind we didn't even optimize this level yet. Like I'm thinking this can go. For example. And that one. Can you see that one? I don't think you can ever get the camera that low. So that's what I'm thinking. Okay. That's like another 100 triangles already done. So we do need the one up here and the one down there. Except for maybe this one here. But yeah, you get the idea. If we do that, it should be a bit better too. This level could benefit from calling. Yes. Maybe. There is a problem with calling. And that is that it doesn't make sense to call anything that is not visible in the laggiest view. So like this one here probably makes sense to call. But that's only like 150 triangles. The Bowser here doesn't make sense to call at all if you ask me. Maybe Bowser's Tower here makes sense to call. Oh, and as optimization we didn't even do yet. We didn't even make a collision map. Making a collision map is also going to improve this a lot. Because the game is going to have to process a lot less collision triangles. But let's try this one more time and see if it's any better. But the materials. What material? What are you talking about? What did I say that prompted you to say about the materials? Most of the textures are only used there? Yeah. Still, that's like a bunch of useless culling vertices that are being loaded here. And if you're not looking at Bowser, you basically get stable 60 FPS anyway. Like, who cares at that point? Can I do factory-looking thing? I called it. No, no, I agreed. The factory makes sense to call. The factory and the Bowser Hotel, like this and this, they make sense to call. Because this is going to be where you're platforming and you're going to not always look at that. You can hold the camera inside the construction area with no care about whether you go behind the building. We can delete the polygons behind the buildings. I'm not holding the camera like that if it's not necessary. I'm not holding the camera like that if it's necessary. Well, that barely dips below 30. Even my 30 FPS is our goal. Fullscreen fine. Oh, some of those triangles are weird. 26. I think we can live with 26. The worst part in such a big level being 26 is perfectly fine with me. Plus, there's still optimizations to come, so... It's not like all hope is lost. Like, we didn't even do the collision map yet. And the collision map has a huge impact. I think the glowing thing has dupe triangles. It could be. But, I don't know. In N64, all kinds of janks can be going on. So, that's not necessarily true. Yeah, I don't see any duplicates here.  I don't see any duplicates here. 26. There were none. Just an angle where you're not moving, so 26 is the problem. Exactly, that's my thought process for that, too. So, we're gonna make it so that on N64, the backface culling on this material and this material here... ...is gonna be turned on. And that is what made all the performance difference. Backface culling is insane. Okay. Alright, back to programming our Goomba here. Oh yeah, this also is still here. The translate nodes, which is like one useless matrix multiplication every single frame. Try this on Emu. Subdivide? What? Let's see if backface culling works nice on Emulator. Fine. I don't like it. I prefer it with backface culling off.  This tower here was being weird. Yeah, for some reason this one is more squished than the others, isn't it? Very weird. We've already done performance on everything in some place. We haven't done any optimization on this level yet. Like, it's fine. And we have most of the geometry here. And we still have the option to move things, like, to different places or to just remove a thing or two. We still have the option to, like, simplify this part. I don't like it. What is wrong with it? You can't see the bars. That's why I don't like it. Drawing distance on oil stuff? You mean, like, the moving parts here? Of course the drawing distance is gonna be improved. That will be higher. I'm just not gonna do that right now. Ugh. Okay, so next up we're gonna have to make it so that the Goomba detaches from the plank after it's fallen too far. Oh, that's a nice sound. Okay. Is it just me or is the sound sped up? Maybe it is sped up. Please let Badub do sound design as well, please. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Sound design is gonna happen at the end. When I actually have everything in place so we know how much space we have for sounds and all that. Ugh. Ugh. Hmm. I don't like the T-Stack in the floor like that. I'll send back the seven years old. That is a long while ago. Hmm. Why use 1.6? Why not? Give me one reason to switch. Hmm. I'm not a boomer. Leela is a boomer. Dude, khaki death. I changed some of your code again. Look at the clip Mario code. It's all different now. What you gonna do? Cry about it? Actually, I don't think it's too different. Like 10 years younger than me. What a baby. Hmm. Hey, if you're not used to it in a while, yeah. I switched from Twitch because it's just got so full of ads that I just can't stand it anymore. Get a concept? Nope. Okay, let's just see how this looks for now. And then we can see how to proceed.  Why is- Why is this floating? Oh, I know why. Hmm. Okay, the Goomba did not move. Why is he not moving? I'm at 27. Okay. Yeah, the transition to YouTube is a bit rough. I've been streaming here for a few months and we still don't even have the viewers that we did on Twitch, which is very sad. And there's also so much delay. Maybe YouTube streaming isn't quite there yet. Hmm. Oh, what? I've- Okay, I accidentally- I don't know how that didn't instantly crash, but that explains a few things. I guess it's another Project 61 accuracy. Okay. Okay, we're getting there. I am using the low latency mode, Minty. At least I'm intending to use the low latency mode. Maybe it didn't apply correctly. Okay, that's a bit too much speed. But I'm starting to see it all come together. That is beautiful. Okay. Let's see how this works out. Okay. We have 13 seconds delay. I've tried earlier and people were like at half a minute of delay. Hello, struggle. How does this work here? It's just like Twitch. But on YouTube. I have not warmed up to Michael the game, no. I'm sorry, CockyDev. Okay, he's not squished correctly yet. That's one thing to fix. I'm simping? Who am I simping? Can I take down the bridge? What does that mean? Alright, the final image is beautiful. Like it ending like this is the best thing ever. I love this. Unfortunately, Zeina is out with friends today, so you don't get to see her. What? YouTube filters the word come? I'm going to get rid of the case watch channel. Now you have watched previous live streams here. I'm just going to leave it in active BF2. There's no reason to delete it. Make him cry. Like the banana cat. Dude, are you guys also seeing the banana cat and the happy cat memes all the time everywhere? Am I being haunted or is that like an actual thing that's just in the public consciousness right now? Because I hear no one talking about it and I see them everywhere. Do you guys know what the banana cat is? And the happy cat? Happy, happy, happy. That's how the cat goes. Yeah, Kaki definitely knows the cat. What the fuck is this?     So you don't know? I will show you. I will show you what I'm talking about. This will be a fucking wild experience for you. All right. It's this. I see this everywhere. Wait, it's... Like what the fuck? It's everywhere. All right, that was beautiful. Maybe a bit more bounciness. Can I see a click on it? No way. I have never seen this once in my life. Oh no. It's only a me thing, isn't it? The sad cat picture addiction is going too far. Shit maybe that's why I'm being halted by this Look Biobak you get your news on the news and I get my news on happy happy Miparu With the banana cat that is crying Might he get on top of it. Oh, oh, oh look at this That's why Let's try this again Oh Those were turtle sex songs. All right, I'm glad we have a furry expert in chat right here But today I didn't talk about you earlier what betta is lying to you And the fact I'm laughing like this only strengthens bettas lie that is terrible Actually, we were just talking about how much we were missing you He still gets on top and falls through But I would never lie on a Friday morning true. I can attest to that. I have not seen him lie on a Friday morning today I Surely there's a way to make the thing stay below that See man, then this is what we call a safe in the business And there we go, this works very nice Let me make sure it never looks weird one thing I'm worried about that it looks weird is if I Fall with the thing with the plank. Oh That that was fine It's safe I saved it The Kids would call it risk And me too because I'm young and not a boomer That is true I did touch Mara Yeah Sure grandpa What's the word for like, oh sure granddaughter I'm younger and I would not say risk clearly because you are a boomer. I'm younger too Just putting it out there It should squish Mario and deal to damage I don't know if you can get squished by it, but if you've managed to somehow get squished by it I think you should die for that Wait what I have no idea what struggle is talking about right now I touched her right in the Yoshi. She would not let anyone else touch the Yoshi All right, next we need the womps, I think It would be cool if you could already program the overseer, but we need the animations first. We can make the womps next but Let's see where we can find the womp I Wanted to have it sound as bad as possible. Yeah. Yeah Touch your face. I might have touched your face Please Please he's existing models. Yeah, I was just thinking about where one is and I have just remembered that we have one right here Oh, he's looking kind of slick I See vertex colors Why is he using ci8s, what is this this model doesn't export You Where's this model you this is not a real model. I don't think this is in the game Kind by do you ever work on this game off stream? Yes all the time and thank you for the donation Yeah, I'm just wondering is this model actually used I don't think it is I Yeah, he doesn't even have any armature here I Should smooth the hands That is the donation that we saw like half an hour ago I Think all of it should be shaded flat Like some of it sure but not all of it I Was going on I hope my stream still life. I hope it didn't crash us now Using same clan Amiga my stand up Scaffolding behind his back. He's gonna we need to do something with us back. I agree Scaffolding though. I'm not sure I That looks decent to me I Think I should make this shop as well There we go Yeah, it's gonna look a lot better in game the boy Can you sing buck with me on blast music and I don't know what are that of the lyrics? I'm sorry That's all you get But you only have a one model in game Not like this This is gonna be he's gonna be a construction workers basically So it's gonna be different He doesn't understand German silent You Can you sing mining diamonds parody minecraft YouTube I Just out of concern for your ears. I would prefer not to do that Someone said rebar coming out rebar instead a lick ma He Needs a helmet. Yes. Yes. Yes. The thing is, okay. He's gonna be carrying steel beams I think it would be funny if their helmet was like on their back Because usually that's the vulnerable spot right with Cooper's the vulnerable spot is the hat with goombas the vulnerable spot as I had With bombs the vulnerable spot is their back. So it would be really funny if we made that work Also, it would allow us to space them further apart saving it with performance I 37 dollars really? I mean, that's not too too bad, I guess So Like $37 of today's money or back then money Head I'm not sure I get it In 2001 money damn, that's a lot Said it's attached to spec like a belt. Oh, yeah, I like that I Like this and then the bell just goes like to the front that would look really cool I Guess this is just a preview render lighting doesn't really matter. It's gonna look completely different and fine in game I Give hating on the lump in his head. I Think he's adorable with a spell term it I Just need a good bell texture here and then we're ready to go I think I Would prefer to be able to do this without a texture though You guys think just pure black would be fine Or pure white Pure black looks a bit weird. Maybe one of these gray pixels would be best I Use a brown pixel, I don't really have a brown pixel here I Just make a new color that's just brown Yeah, I think that works out maybe you should be wearing it a little lower It looks very goofy I Remove the background from the head over so you get a vertex colorable texture combine yourself if we make this colored by a vertex color Then we don't have shading on it So that would look really weird The way it is right now I can only shade it with brightness by a shade alpha like this I Add the stripe to a texture The stripe is added to the texture The stripe is a texture I Mean, oh you mean you want the belt on the on his face here. Oh It would work yeah I Although the face only has 16 colors, so that's also not gonna be great. I Improved water that see haters I Think I'm happy with the one Next time we will animate the one and we'll make the mission where you just kick them over and basically the way the ones work is they're just gonna be carrying a steel beam and you can just kick them over and stay Awful, and everyone's upset You One thing I'm not really sure about yet is how are you gonna figure out to mess with everyone like I gotta figure out to mess with the Goomba and The actually the cement guy is gonna be easy But like the oil barrels That's gonna be something one two, three four five, yeah, there's five people you mess with Yes, the one was protected So That's something I definitely want to brainstorm but that is for next time and I'll see you guys next week for the next stream
