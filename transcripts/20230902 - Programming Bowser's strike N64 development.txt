Where is the gang at? I'm late? I am not late. You are out of your mind. How am I late? You are exactly two. What? I am being ripped off here. Hello Selden. Hello Rashid. Hello Not A Random. Hello Undefined Zero. Hello Ahh! Why do you name yourself like that? Hi Selden. Hello Undefined. Hello Not A Random. Hi Ahh! I fear that today is going to be a Biobank stream because he told me to send him a lot of models and I did. Biobank is doing it again. Dude I noticed that I had a shitty filter setting on. My footage looks so much better. Let me show you a video. Well, I mean that's still clearly N64 footage. I did download Power Toys, yes. Hello Xeroclone. Look how beautiful this looks now. Hi Xeroclone. Oh wow that looks so much better than before. Any OST wishes for today? Hi Hi Leela. Leela look the footage is fixed. Hi Leela. Any OST wishes for today? So we're going to be working on Bozo's office. Could you see the frame rates? Yeah. It's a very very nice looking video I think. I've been working on the sign video as you can see. And I don't know I'm pretty happy with how it's turning out. Our function is symmetrical. So if it's valid on the first eighth, 0 to pi divided by 4. What do you think? It would also be valid on minus pi divided by 4 to 0. I think it looks good. Sonic Mania OST. All right, let's do it. Zainman ramblings. Dude, the video is literally about saving 50 nanoseconds. And ironically, it's like a part of the video. At this point, I'm just doing it for the meme. Hello Magnificent Kirby. No, they're still big as savings. I think like in course one, it takes 26 milliseconds to render the whole frame. I think we can get it down to maybe maybe like 24.5. Nice come t-shirt. Does it say come? I'd buy it back. I already said that today is probably going to be the bio backstream. Am I right about that? I guess you wanted to change so many models. Aren't you the Mario 64 guy? Mario 64? What is that? Did they already make 64 Mario games? No way, dude. Like what do I remember? Mario Galaxy, Mario Odyssey, Mario Bros 1, Mario Bros 3. They should be making Mario 5 next. Maybe Mario 6. No way they should make 64. What is that? They made 65 already? Oh my God. Oh my God. They're way ahead of Final Fantasy. Scalenio made Super Mario 65. I hope it's a good game. Well, I wouldn't know because I've never heard of this Mario 64. But sources have told me that it's kind of terrible. And it's just stolen levels, but I don't know. That's just a random thing someone said once. Didn't the guy also claim he had permission to use the levels? I mean, he did, but he didn't have permission to use them without credit. Oh, well then. I have the base model inside so you can see the changes. And I'll tell you what I want to know. All right. Okay, I guess today is going to be a model replacing stream. For the new sign video, I needed to record a lot of N64 footage. And unfortunately, I found out that a lot of the levels have floating point exceptions when you enter them right now on N64. Which is not going to be difficult to fix, but it's going to be annoying as fuck. Wait, why? For example, the Goomba has a floating point exception when you crush him. Probably because the scale goes to exactly zero. Or something like that. Nice steel beam texture. I'm not sure if that's ironic. I don't see any specific special steel beam texture here. Oh, you mean these? I thought you meant this one here. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, I have to show this to you guys. Biobank, you're going to enjoy this. I will show you. We did a cool thing with this level. I was so. Yeah, I completely forgot that this happened this week. I have very fun facts for you. So you see this beam texture here? This now, instead of having one CI4 texture, which is 1-bit alpha, which means alpha is either on or off. This is one RGBA16 texture, which is a 32x32 for the steel beams. And then it has a 64x64 texture for the alpha mask. Or maybe 64x32, I don't remember. Either way, because we now have 8-bit alpha or even 16-bits. I also don't remember that part. We now have much, much smoother edges here. And it looks so much better. It doesn't look crusty. I like it. So there's a cool thing inside, unlike the other levels. Wait, what? Cool thing inside, that's not in the other levels? What does that mean? There's something missing from the other levels? Yeah, the blue coins drop when you stand on a thing. But they just blink. Looks blurrier but crisper at the same time. That's... That's a thing to say. Okay, I know what you mean. I know what you mean, yes. Actually, you are actually right. That's the crazy part. It is blurrier and crispier. Because the detail texture here has half the detail now. So it is blurrier, objectively speaking. But the edges are much crisper. Alright, this is going to be Bowser's office. I think that's a good size for it. Then there's going to be a guy here. In the wall. That's like, oh, you want to visit Bowser? Too bad. Definitely fixable with some contrast adjustments. Did I send you the Thwomp animations? I am not sure. Hang on. I think those are done. Let me double check first. Because I think I had two variations of them. Right, I remember. There was one that was really repetitive. And I told you that we can only use that for one of them. Because otherwise it's going to be a bit obnoxious. Yeah, I have another one. So I am going to just... Is this an extended OST? Nope, it's not. Check Discord. Oh my god, so many files. Alright. So we are going to import all of Biobank's remade models today. While you're streaming, it is not Saturday. It is Saturday. I will not be gaslit. Here we go. I'm just sending you Thwomp's animations right quick. Alright. I have to do that after Biobank's models here. Yep, that's fine. It's not... You are all gaslighting me. MrBeast, we're not listening to MrBeast right now. I'm sorry guys. You're speaking nonsense on a Thursday again. Damn. See the fucked up part is... I changed my workout routine this week. So usually this day would be my off day because I changed my routine. Today is my bench day. So the gaslight almost worked because I usually bench on Fridays. Why did I hear MrBeast? I had this tab open. I actually study MrBeast's videos like a fucking nerd. I look at them and be like, Oh, why do people like this? How can I implement this? Alright. These are some interesting switch designs. This one has a bit of the cap switch vibe, which I do like. Lila does not like these. Well, this one is literally just an objectively improved vanilla thing. Right? There's no argument here. It's just better. Nice. That's a very nice little blue coin block. You like this one, but it lacks the texture. That is a fair point. Is someone like watching a demo? No. Okay. This one is also interesting, but I think this one doesn't fit our design. What if we combine this idea here and this idea here into one? Like having the coin on the switch instead of the blue circular surface? Yeah, let me just do that real quick. Okay. Biobank modeled this so small. How about something like that? Will you by any chance make a level maker from R6 or R8? I literally already did that. What is the art department saying about this one? I like it. I think art department says it looks nice. You like this too, Biobank? It's pretty good. I am wondering if maybe I want to make this a bit flatter. Wait, I have a sick idea for this. What if a new ground pounder does this? Wait, that's not how I want it. One second. So we have it like this. When you ground pound it, it disappears because it's a blue coin switch. Yeah, I'm just thinking about how exactly the disappear animation should look like right now. Okay, that's a bad idea. It should scale down and also go down, I think. Use the scale one for the button part. So you want it to just do this and have the button stay? I mean, this looks very good. Yeah, I think so too, Biobank. A scale bone, you say? Could work. It looks very nice. Question, since this is monocolour, does this need to be a CI8? Wait, it's vertex coloured. I don't like that. I don't agree with vertex colouring this, I'm sorry. Instead, I'll do something very similar, just that also allows for the word light to exist. I guess this isn't really a trick that you as an artist would be expected to know. Also, we can't use environment colour in the combiner. Because environment colour is set to random stuff. I just realised that. If you use alpha in the combiner, sometimes stuff just disappears. Alright, good nap, Beta. Good night, Beta. Good nap. Did I fuck it up? Nope, I think this is just supposed to be like this. But wait, if this is in the texture anyway, why do we need vertex colours? No, we don't need to cycle here. I'm just going to bake it into the texture. Is it this texture here? I think it's a custom version of this texture. The thing that is bothering me is that the star is not axis aligned. You have a point. Oh, I see why it's not axis aligned. Oh, it can't be axis aligned with this. Wait, do you have lights baked into this texture? Oh, that's an issue. Do you think we can unbake the lights here? Because the lights are supposed to be in the level itself. Yeah, this is what you're thinking, right? If you unbick them, it will look bad. The light is gonna actually be in the level itself, by the way. So I think it will look good. I mean, we can just give this a try. Should be fine. This is the texture I'm gonna use. Just rotate the model so it matches the level light, to be honest. That's honestly a fair point. Just test it out in Blender. I don't trust the Blender light. I think the vertex colors were something like this. Cool. Nope, definitely not. What are these horrors I am unleashing? That's not what it looked like. How do you make a gradient? Gradient tool exists? Where's the gradient tool? Is it in here? Yes. Where? I think it should be under a submenu in the paint bucket. You said it's in here. Hello? Paint bucket tool, pastel triangle. I just said that. You said it was in the menu I had opened. No, I didn't say that. Well, that's what I asked and you said yes. No. It is what I asked. We have a stream clip of it. I said it's in the paint bucket tool. There's a cat outside. Like that? Tweak opacity. I think it's fine. Looks good to me. Doesn't that look a little too dark? Maybe. Maybe. I also wanted this to be an eye 8. Oh wait, I do not want this to be an eye 8 anymore. You guys think it's too dark? Tweak opacity. Oh, I can do that? I see. Yeah, I like this. All right, there we go. More saturation and contrast. Why you didn't use vanilla blue switch? Because it looks like dog shit? What? All the vanilla models are awful. Damn. Give me one vanilla Mario 64 model that is not awful. Sushi doesn't look bad. Have you seen it's rigged though? Oh, and the size of this is a little bit off. Let me get the size right. Or is it? Wait, did you use my model as an orientation here? It says 34 coordinates. How is it only 34 coordinates? That is so small. Oh, it's scaled by three. That makes sense. That is 102. There we go. I deleted your model by accident. I see. Everything's small with you, damn. Don't forget render. Please, yeah. Render area is important. So I kind of refused to do this because that is insanely stupid. We're going to have to make a new scale animation anyway. This is going to be a long stream dedicated just to updating models. That is what you should be expecting. We have a long stream of 30 models and a 30 minute stream of something else. You shouldn't be guessing numbers. What numbers am I guessing? Oh, the render area. Well, what am I supposed to do? There isn't really a good way to compute rendering right now. I've asked for a feature to manually and to automatically compute it so many times now. Add an empty. I guess that's a decent way of doing it. That's not even a good way of doing it, I think. Like, what would you add? An empty cube? Actually, yeah, it's kind of a cube. All right, let's see what this is. I can't even scale it up. What a fucking limitation. 185. All right, we'll do 185. That was a good suggestion, I think. How does an empty help? What do you mean? Why do you want me to add an empty instead of a cube? Huh? I think I want more Wanda. That looks pretty cool. Can you change the meters or not? So? It's just going to be harder to see because the empty is not opaque. What, it doesn't even need animation? You ground pound it? There's no time for an animation. Hmm. I think it'd look very good. That's mainly it, honestly. It doesn't need one, but I think it would look very good. It would feel slower. How long is the animation right now? Oh, the animation is five frames. You know what? Fair. A five frame thing doesn't need an animation. All right, let's not make an animation then. Damn, it's so much better than the previous one. Okay, a collision map should be just like that. Like that. Where's my macro? Double tap invisible and tangible once it's pressed. Wait, why? That would be maybe even more work than doing it the other way. Okay, I want the stone sound. That is the stone sound. Wait. Fuck. Let's check it out. Metal or glass? I don't think it's metal. I think it's stone. Just get Mari for scale. Why would I get Mari for scale if I have actual measurements? I think that looks good. What do you guys think? The base looks really small. It is kind of small looking. Well, those things are just in the rock. All right, let's update that level and update the button scale. I think like 1.5 times bigger is good. Can I just type in multiply 1.5? I can. That's cool. 1.5 to 1.5. Have I even played it? Will there be remastered audio clips from Mario? No, I was not planning on it. You can do them in most text fields. There are some where you can't do it, I think. I feel like I remember that happening to me. Why were these so far in the thing? What the hell? Even the switch was. I moved the entire model down to piss you off. I knew it. Oh yeah, that's much better. I think this looks really good. Did you guys see it? Did you guys see the issue? Anyone else have laser eyes like me? No one saw the issue. This trial game is pretty good. Set this position to the Mario position minus 40. And... wait... It's 87 units below Mario. Question mark, question mark, question mark. Yeah, same bro. What the fuck? Wait, so this is less tall than the original Switch model. Oh, okay, this is what happened. It came back out of the ground. I see. I see. Now it should be good. It has less tallness. Is that what I said? It does.  Well, I did not mean to press F4. Cool. Let's try that again. That looks fine to me. Yeah, that's better. Let's try that again.  Did I not give this collision? I did. Case the button texture. What about it? What do you want me to do? Need some more contrast? Talk to Biobank about that. I don't know if it looks better or not. For me, that's hard to decide.  Did you put the button anywhere? I put it in the level, yeah. Lila is saying this needs more contrast, but I don't know if it does. I think it needs to be a little brighter. It looks way too dark. Brighter? The metal is fine. I'm talking about the button. Wait, this part is fine? The button is too dark? Yeah. Huh. This was a nice blue. It's a very nice blue, but I'm not sure if anyone is going to see the star on the level. But I haven't seen it in-game yet. I'm busy animating. Oh, you're going to improve both textures, Biobank? I'll just leave this open then and wait for that. And then I will import the next model. Bluefish.blend. You're welcome, Lila. Thank you. Is this the original fish? And then this is our fish? What is going on here? You optimized the fish surface? Which one is the new one, though? Old fish, Armored Shell BJ. Oh, is this your new one? Wait, before you say anything, I will decide which one I like the most and then I will decide which one I will use. This kind of looks like the vanilla fish. I think I'm going to have to go with this fish just because this one doesn't have an extra texture. But I might add the brittle to the fin here. Last one. Okay, there's a problem here. Because we have so many fish, having an extra texture to load is going to be really, really bad. It's a lot better to have this fish be just one texture. Because if it's two textures, then we have to load both textures in a row. If it's just one texture, we can batch render them. It has one material? Oh. I see. Oh, I see, I see. And you added the little fin part here. Oh, that is neat. Yeah, I like it. Okay. Look at the texture in the UV map tab. Alright. Fishy. That is neat. Oh, and it's a CI4 as well. I'm just going to delete this one. Okay, there's going to be one issue here. And that is that if you reimport the armature, Fuzz64 will fuck it up. It uses too many colors to fit a CI4. Dang. That sucks. I guess we have to go with RGBA. Oh, that is so much bigger. Was it using an RGBA before? I'm not sure, actually. Let's look at the fish in game. Is there a texture I see, I don't know. He means the texture in my fish. Of course vanilla doesn't use it. It uses intensity textures actually. The only non-RGBA texture I remember in Mario 64 is the broken smoke texture. It looks mostly very good. What if they updated fast64 so that this works now and that's why it's broken? Yeah, definitely a cosmic ray. Yeah, I should do that later. I just haven't done that. I wasn't gonna bother with doors after Quatrainian animations are in because I have to change them then again anyway. Why do all the transitions look weird? That's like a thing I could have made a while ago where Mario just kind of keeps moving. Dude, there's something really weird about wall collisions in this game right now. Nope, that made it even worse. That's a fast64 bug if I've ever seen one. Oh my god. There's a terrible bug here and that is that the fin is pivoting around its... Is it actually pivoting around the front? I'm not sure. Maybe it'd look fine if the fin was actually in there. Anyone changing the GL layout? Nope, that was the vanilla fast64 GL layout just now. I changed it once and it was bad and then I changed it back and just used the vanilla fast64 thing and it was worse. So now I'm gonna do the exact opposite of what fast64 tried to do and I bet it's gonna be perfect. And I think what I'm gonna do for the transitions is I'm gonna have it so that the input that you held just keeps being held. And Mario just kind of goes through states and you can't input anything instead of what we have right now. In the vanilla game Mario just disappears. No, the exact opposite of what fast64 was doing isn't good either. It looks like I just have to guess what the right number is which I think looks like maybe 7. Sure is fun. Why did the fish have a dislocated fin? Fast64 bug. There's also a really weird Quidditch bug going on right now apparently. Would I talk to a Nintendo programmer? As in like if I know a person is a Nintendo programmer would I just refuse to engage in conversation with them? Or do you just assume by default I refuse to engage in conversation with people unless there's like a good reason? Yeah, I think this is good. You know what? I should back up all my github desktop files just to make sure that nothing bad happens here. Here. Because I don't want to accidentally overwrite a file I still need. I think it's not gonna work.  It's not cartoony enough. Well, not much you can do with like a 5-pixel fish. Why using github desktop offline mode? Why are you so upset? I had the program open for 5 seconds. It is not worth my time to try and figure out how to turn offline mode. Can't load the variables on screen. Why? Is there anything bad that can happen?  Alright, that's a really cool looking switch. Taking confidential information. Oh, I don't use github desktop for work. So I'm fine. How is this the same texture? Shade color alpha? Yeah, this looks really really good. I'm just wondering how we accomplish this. Okay, the one thing I'm not a fan of is the vanilla exclamation mark texture here. Well, I do have to verify that your information of this is actually something that will work in game. Check the model above. I prefer this. This exclamation mark texture looks better if you ask me. This one is so like not smooth. I should have an exclamation mark somewhere. Yeah, the red color there is really nice. And I'm guessing it will translate to other colors as well. Oh, that is nice. It's also twice the size. Yes, I can use a small texture if that's what you want. The problem here is the texture format. It's because you use an intensity alpha 8 bit texture. I'll show you how I would do it. If I had a high resolution exclamation mark texture somewhere. It's just question marks. Oh, there's one. Kind of. I think I can make it work with this one. Let me show you what I would do here. Okay. So what size did we want this? Maybe 16 by 32 I think is what you had. Oh, there's an exclamation mark on each side. I see. I think I like it. Okay. What did I fuck up? Okay, I see an issue here. This is not centered. How is this so much not centered though? What the hell? I cut the texture exactly in the middle. Okay. Okay. So the middle could be a bit nicer. This is actually terrible. This is actually terrible. Why is this so bad? That is not what I expected like at all.  I'll throw this on and off. Yeah, but the edges are not smooth like I expected. Check and uncheck mirror T. You're mirroring a big black texture. Yes, but what I really want is like the middle doesn't show up properly and the edges here. That's like what's really bothering me.  Yeah, that's a lot better. Let's go with something like this after I fix the texture obviously.  What do you think of something like this? Yeah. Too wide? Yeah, it's too wide. I'm fixing it right now. Yeah. Way too wide but better texture. Yeah, that's what I thought too. Oh, we don't need a primitive color on this. Why does this have a prim color? There we go. Too low height wise? We can't make it any taller. Oh, wait. The original kind of moves around here. Yeah, we could recreate that effect. But it will add two extra triangles. Extra triangle like this, right? But then I also have to wrap this around here. No, I heard you Lila. I read what you said. It will be something like that. Two triangles don't matter by the way. Don't worry about them. It's not two milliseconds. It's not even two microseconds. This is... Like 0.3 microseconds. Why is the first version brown? It's just a darker version of the other one. Yeah, that's what it is when you press them. Oh, I see. I'm sure we can do that. I'm just thinking about the best way to implement that right now. Maybe later. I don't think it's related to what we're doing right now. But maybe later we can implement that. I don't think this already... Oh, no. I don't think this has anything set up. So we have to set all that up ourselves right now.  The cap switches are so weird in how they work. They are like two parts. I think we're just going to fuse them into one. We're going to completely change how this works. So we're just going to delete the cap switch space. I hate that they use switch tables like this. Apparently there was a test level here. I didn't know that. Okay. Apparently they had a cap switch test level. That's cool. Because the top one scales. Do you want the scale animation? I didn't think the top one scaled. What if we added an in-between model? And the model just changed between the three states. And then the in-between model was half way dark and half way deformed like you have it. I don't want the scale one. Because the final model looks different. If I can have an animation, it will be an in-between. Alright. We'll add an in-between model. I didn't know there was a test level like that either until just now. And the only evidence for that I saw was that there was code specific for this test level. That made it so that the cap switch is always just hit down. Even though it didn't activate the cap, it just made the cap switch be hit down. Is this referenced anywhere else? Boo-rah? OK, I'm just going to leave this here, just in case it's useful for something later on. There's no reason for the check to exist, so I'm removing it, obviously. Oh my god, how big did you make these? Oh, they're original sized, but the original size is like twice as big as they should be. I see. If I can render it, yeah. I'm just thinking one in-between model or two in-between models. I'm undecided. I think two is better. One should be enough. But the original animation has five frames here, actually. This looks like four frames. What do the arguments mean? A0, OK, and that's the flags. A1 is the timer. So 0, 1, 2, 3. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. It's four in-between states. 0 is just the up one. 1, 2, 3, 4. There's three in-between states. Let's just make two. What does 0 point to? The current object. What do you think of something like this? One down, two down, and then this is fully done. What is the color of this? I wish I could just see the vertex colors. Anyone know how to just read the vertex colors out of the Blender model, like right here? I don't want to guess. This looks like maybe 6, 3, 6, 7, something like that. Select a simple preview mode. OK, the white button, that one. OK, where's the color? It doesn't say a number. I can't pick this, but if I apply this, it's going to change. You see that? I am back. Welcome back. There's no way it's black.  Something's wrong. That's the color, just make it. What's the color though? 6, 3, 6, 5? What's the original color? 128? I want the numbers. Couldn't you just find the original switch and color pick it from Photoshop or something? Nope, this has nothing to do with the original switch. Ah. Oh, fuck, that's the wrong color. Wait, is this, does it use shade color or shade color alpha? Text 0, minus shade color, multiply shade color alpha, plus shade color. So shade color, that's a crazy combiner. What are you trying to do here? Wait, what was the point of this? Why is it like this? Can I just use this? There already was no lighting, but this is an environment map texture, so it's fine. That's better than straight shade alpha. You are blending into the level color using shade color alpha. So if you do that, what's going to happen is that the switch is going to change its color to the color of the level. It looks different in the Blender preview than it will look in game. That's the problem here. We can have lightning and vertex colors and level colors at the same time. All we have to do is bake the red into this texture here and change the texture per switch model. So if I multiply this by one, it's   multiply this by red, then we can have it all. We can have our cake and eat it too, yes. It looks bad now, but don't worry. There we go. You can change it so easily from how you're messing it up. Because if we have prim color, then we have to choose between, wait, OK, I see what you mean. We have to choose between prim color,  I see your idea. Actually, I don't know if that was your idea, but you did just give me an idea. That is even better than what I was going to do. What were you going to do? I agree. The vertex color idea was goofy. I'm just going to have this and make it go darker as the switch goes down. Just leave it the way it was. But that was missing level light the way it was. That's the problem. It didn't take world light. This way, it's going to look like it's actually in the level. Try it again. Trust, I have a very, very good plan. I know exactly what I'm doing here. This one is also not receiving world lights. Is that a big deal if we just do this? But you're shading. Wait. You're shading. Let me download your model again and see what you mean. We can probably have both. The problem is, if you don't have level world lighting, it's going to look good in Blender, but it's not going to look good in game, I find. You want it dark towards the bottom here. That's the main thing. I'm using world lights, but it's so much better. If you have a model in the level itself, it's usually better to have it work with world lights so that it actually looks like it's placed in the world. I'm still thinking of a way to make this work the way I want. If I made it with vertex colors, like, let's say, wind cap level, then wouldn't vertex colors work better? Well, the world light is baked into that. I'm going to make it look like it's placed in the world.   We can actually make this work using vertex colors, I think. I think all the cap levels are evenly distributed lighting-wise anyway. I'm fine with bringing them back. Although I'm not 100% a fan of it, but I'm fine with doing that. I guess it was kind of like that. Let's load surfaces. Huh? I'm not sure I understand that.  I mean, the ideal is that you have a mix of baked lightings and actual real hue transitions and lights. His hard opinions are objectively correct. Let's see. I'm going to do this, and then I'm going to multiply all of these with something slightly darker. All right, there we go. These are going to be our switch models. Yep, these are going to be different models. It's just the most convenient way to do this. Just use a switch bone, you're wasting RAM. No? It doesn't matter. You're wasting minutes of my life having me implement a switch bone when they basically don't really work at all. Have you ever actually tried to do something like this with switch bones? It sucks. It doesn't work. Ever. What? What a cap switch exclamation? What the hell? I have a dozen. It never works for me. I don't know what you're doing differently. This is going to be our render area. You weren't kidding. This is a biomextreme today. Yep, I figured as much. I just added a box, because render area is done linearly in each direction. There is not a sphere or anything. When you make a box around it, then the smallest box that encompasses the whole model is going to be the optimal render area. I'm going to make a box around it.     This should be group 8. Cap switch 1. That is so much faster than making the bones. You know why else making armatures with switch fucking sucks? It's because then you get the error that all the bone names have to be different. It's just so jank. And they always just translate upwards for some reason. And you have to translate them back down. I hate how that works. I have 3 monitors. Shit. Why are they not here? Fuck. Oh. Was group 8 wrong? No, group 8 is correct. Must have misspelled it. Alright, now for the collision. I think we're only going to make collision for these two here. I think the collision is done. Well then. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. All right, let's try it. I mean Biobank did most of the work. Also, hello Rionu, how come you are here today? Thoughts on using private variables versus just void? I think private variables are completely useless and should never exist. They have no right to be around. Well, that went as bad as it could have. It's because I forgot to increment the model IDs. I also need to not set the prim color there. I forgot that. And the fact that it crashed indicates that this doesn't work for some reason. Fuck private variables. Why are they private? Let me access them. Private variables don't exist in C. That's like a delusion that C++ programmer streamed up. Private variables don't exist on the processor. Why is it a thing in your code? It doesn't even stand for anything. A wise man once said that the hardest question in programming is whether something is divine intellect or too much voodoo. And private is too much voodoo. They mean nothing to the processor. Right, I need to set the primitive color. GeoSwitchAnimState? Really? Oh my god, that is awful. We're not doing that. I have no idea why private variables were created. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?  What? Okay, what are our switch colors? Why are you monkaSing me? I'm ignoring chat? What am I ignoring? Y'all are just talking about JetBrains like I know what that is. Okay, so the first one is the red switch. The second one is the green one. So red, green, blue is the normal one. I think we have the white one replaced with the white one. I think our second cap switch is like the ice cap switch. So... Wait, can we just... Oh, all our switches were white, cool. Hue picker. It's like a nice blue, something like this. 112, 165, 255. So we have cloud cap, ice cap, and our last one is the bomb cap. What color would the bomb cap be? Like a dark blue? It's a bit weird to have two blue switches, right? Ice cap, cyan. Oh, we have the wing cap, but you don't need to unlock it. I think this fits better for the ice cap, yeah? A bit more cyan. Alright, let's give it another try. What's the wing cap level for them? Is there a wing cap switch? There is! Let me check it. Let me check that, actually. Okay, this is zero. Zero. Oh, the cloud cap is over the vanish cap, which is the second one. So the first one should be red. Is it pure red, or do you have like a nicer color picked here? Nope, that is pure red. So there's four cap switches in this game. We do not have a yellow switch in this game. Hello, clayman! Hi, clayman! Dude, something's really weird with swimming. I must have messed up a collision function somewhere. I am not near the sun now. Damn, this looks good. I think it's very nice looking. Was the animation too instant? Yeah, except for the crashing, obviously. I think I should change the collision immediately, so that Mario just kind of falls down. Because it's a bit weird right now. We got a Skeleton Fanboy in here. Damn. What is this? I instantly die when I enter this level? Because of the water bug? You can't move anywhere, can you? Yeah, I'm fucked. Interesting. Awesome level, thank you. Okay guys, I think we reused the red cap switch. And we just have two red cap switches right now. Shouldn't that be in the center of the flowers? Oh, that looks really good. Yes, it should be in the center of the flowers. That is a very good argument. I mean, the down animation for the cap looks good. Oh yeah, I like it a lot. I think I finally got Wiggler's walk or run looking right. Let's see it. Give me like two minutes. I don't know why it wasn't in the middle to begin with. That is a bit weird. That is a bit weird. I also don't know why these cutscenes just crash, but it doesn't really matter for now. Remove world lighting from it. It doesn't have world lighting. All right, here we go. Why was it so dark then? I'm not sure. But that's just what it looks like. Was it dark? Maybe I missed it. Let me check it out again. I might as well check it out with the new collision function right now, because that's something I should have tested anyway. There is a raycasting bug going on when you're underwater, I think. I see what you mean. That is very dark for no good reason. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Is this better? Is this better? I think I just had a very dark baked vertex light. Oh, that is so much nicer. Oh, I much prefer that over the original vanilla switch behavior. Nice. Yes, I'm still using your cloud texture, I think, XPM. It has survived the test of time. I should save this in my files. All right, on to the next file we move. Oh, Biobank updated the coin texture. Let me just do that real quick. Oh, yeah, that is nice. That's a nice texture. Yep. Goomba new. All right, let's see what you did to the Goomba. Oh, do I get to reanimate the Goomba? Hopefully not. Didn't your blend nicest think of Decimate, which can reduce Triton? You should put that on all your levels. Oh, the Goombas look a lot better. This is the new one, I'm guessing. He looks so modern now. Which I guess is a good thing. Exact same triangle count. All right. I am up for this. This is an IA-4, that is good. CIA-8, also good. Oh, they even all receive light. Actually, this one did not receive light. Wait. That should be receiving light and this one should not be receiving light. What the fuck? Oh, they're the same texture. Oh. Is that an update? Was it like that before? Okay, the thing about this is, technically, if Fast64 was perfect, this would be an optimization. But it's not. Hmm. No, I mean the shared texture, Leela. Oh, the feet also use... No, we can't do that with the feet, unfortunately. The problem with this is, if we have the feet like this, it's gonna load the top texture, load this texture and then load these textures separately. So if we do that, then we would have a lot more lag. So I have to reapply the old texture here. How is it not Fast64's fault, Leela? You could technically keep this in RAM and then also draw this. Actually, no, you can't. Yes, you can. Because they're both Layer 4. Wait a second. No. Actually, I think I can do that biobank. But it will require some manual editing. Let me make sure it looks fine in-game and then we will edit the model by hand to fix Fast64's bug. Can you repeat what you said? It's gonna discard the model from memory if we do it like this, Leela. That's the problem. This feels like the old model. Huh? Oh no. Oh no. Compiler errors. Compiler errors. Oh, I know why. It's because the Goomba changes color in one of the levels. Yes. There we go. Please what? They have a soul. Okay, the closed eyes look kind of bad to be honest. And the closed eyes changes color. That's a problem. Yeah, the closed ice texture needs to change. I mean, yeah, the texture was not visible on the model. It's like a separate texture and the whole thing, so I couldn't have seen that. Oh, this is a problem. Oh, no, there's probably a different problem as well. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Let me check that this is fine. Yeah, there's a lot of Goomba in this game, a lot of references to Goombas. I think we need the textures fixed. I'm not really sure what I can do here. I'm gonna make a note for now. I don't think I can do this right now. It is not a find and replace now. We need to remake a lot of features here for this to work correctly. How long is that bug list? There's quite a few in here and a lot that are not tracked either. Oh, new ground pound stars. I'm not really in a bug fixing phase right now, so I don't really care that much. Are they different at all, Viavec? This is how I remember mine looking. Let's make them a bit rounder and change the color a little. Oh, yeah, mine were very sharp, now that you mention it. Let's see. I think it's the same as this. Maybe it's this one. Model a cartoon star. What the hell? Why did I do it like this? Is this even it? Let me test. It seems like such a weird way to doing it. No, that's not it. That's something else. Where are these stars? No, they are here. How did this not delete them? Why am I so confused right now? I am so upset. What is going on? Let me check what this looks like. That does look pretty nice. Yeah, I like it. He does look mamey and that's like the whole style. And it was like, I think the ovo style. How can it be that when I delete this, the thing is still there? But when I delete the geolayout, it's not there. Am I losing my mind? What is going on? No, this is vanilla Mario 64 naming. And this has nothing to do with naming. It just doesn't make any sense. How is this happening? Wait, did I forget to press ctrl s or something? They're still here. How can this be? No, seriously, if I delete the pointer to it, it is still there. But if I delete the thing itself, no, if I delete the pointer to it, the thing is gone. But if I delete the thing itself, it's still there. Wrong model. How is this the wrong model? I confirmed that's the right one by deleting it and the stars didn't show up anymore. Where are you paying attention? Look, as soon as I just end this geolayout here, the stars disappear. They're gone. But if instead of deleting the geolayout, I go into the display list and I delete the display list. Look. They're still here. Yeah, exactly. See you later. That makes no sense. Oh, I see. It's anim state five and the other one were the first four. There we go. Oh, do you actually think this is better by a bike? It looks a bit dark to me. I'm not a big fan of this, to be honest. Yeah, it is too orange. It looks so different in game. It does. Yeah. You're fine with me just doing this. Oh, that's nice. What is the change here? It's a bit of a weird combiner to me. You use the combiner to reduce the glow. The way this is set up is that there's like a dark blue color and a light blue color. And where you set the alpha, it's like the dark blue color. I see. Should work. Let's take a look at it. Yeah, grainy textures do not look good. Anyway, that is a good point. Oh, is this intentional? Does not look good. I don't like this. I think that you've been tricked by a bit of a Fast64 render bug. Okay, we got disconnected, guys. Are we back? Do you see what I said? The NFL is also stretched. Yeah, I saw that. Dude, how do I actually view the colors? This is fucked. Oh, I know why. I think what you wanted in reality is like this. Let's give this a try. Can we visit you, Nagi? The comedy club? We can. I do wonder if it still works. Things have a tendency to break around here after a while. No, it still looks bad. I think the combiner might be a no-go. Why is it a white circle? Oh, he's still here. And all the fishies are here, too. Welcome to the Yanagi comedy club. I hope you all are in the mood for great comedy. Sometimes I get pretty tough crowds. But that's not an issue. Want to know why? There's always more fish in the sea. It did work for the others. Yes, I know that. I get the feeling like it's just this specific combiner that this is having trouble with. It might be in the graphic plugin because I also don't see why this wouldn't work. Like it does look fine to me. Set the vertical shift to minus one. Oh wait, is it the clamp? I think the fact that these were clamped was the issue. Do you think having them not be stretched would look better? I don't know if that's true. I think I prefer this with the stretch. I think end maps look weird if they're repeating usually. And no, the sign is not supposed to be broken. Very rarely do I find that end maps look better when they're stretched. Just because you would see the repeats so easily. This is still bad. Let's try this the other way around again. Just because the shade colors look pretty bright here. Actually no, that wouldn't make any sense. Shit, I don't know.  Let's use this cannon here. I'm going to verify it looks fine anyway. Yeah, it just doesn't look good. By undefined. Yeah, this thing is definitely getting rendered. Let me try a bit with the colors here. The basic idea is that we have something like this, right? They can never be true circles. Because that's what you think, actually. There is a whole different branch of rendering called analytical geometry, I think. And instead of giving it polygons and triangles, you give it math formulas. And you can represent a circle with a math formula. So it's like the closest you can actually get to rendering a circle. Obviously, it's still going to be limited by the amount of pixels that your TV has. I think that we can say that this is just a bug on the emulator plugin. Because I see no reason this wouldn't work. Just an emulator, that's a good idea. I have to connect my controller. There's the one disadvantage about NEMU, I have to use my Xbox controller. Cool. Thank you, Xbox Gaming. I was trying to see if the keyboard worked, but it did not. You have an important question about something. Wow, this question is so important that instead of asking it, you are announcing it. The big question announcement. What could it be? Fine. No, it renders like this even on NEMU. Something is definitely wrong in the combiner. Wait, NEMU crashes here just like N64 would? That's crazy. I could probably debug a lot of N64 crashes in NEMU then. Oh my god, that is going to save me so much time. Okay, what if I just remake this combiner from nothing? Just as a test, I'm going to import this and see how this looks. I just got an old N64 to work with my PC and I really want to play. Oh my god, how would I do about... Yeah, you do need an EverDrive. That is the easiest way to do it. Just have to untangle my cords. Aha, now it works. So, there must be a combiner setting somewhere that fucked it up and I don't know what the setting was. Which one would work best for it? I would just get the cheap Chinese knockoff EverDrive. It works the exact same as the official one and it's cheaper. There we go, that's what you want Biobank, right? A link for you? What link? The summer card one? What is the summer card? I'm not going to advertise someone's products here for free. So, that's the flashcards. They need to pay me, I'm not posting it. There we go. That was just the wrong setting somewhere. I don't know what the setting was, but we have fixed it. What if you asked really nicely? Nope. Oh, you also looked at the fire. I am very curious how the new fire is going to look like. Oh, that looks really good. It's a nice fire. Let's see. I see, I see what the issue is with this. All right, let's give it a try. Just new colors in Geo. Oh, it's just a new color? It didn't look like that. It looked like there's a lot of difference to me. I like it. I'm thinking maybe my She animation is not that great. Do we have to reduce some animations? No, so far none actually. Is there a blue flame deal? I don't think there is. I don't think we use the blue flame right now. So, I'm just going to save this for now. Oh, new fire. Use it and go get Galleon. Is it the same type of flame though? Let me check. Blue flame Geo. Oh, I do. Shit, it's a BBH exclusive and not group 0. Well, that is a bit annoying. Oh well. Let's play around with these. They are too perfect. I see what you mean. Maybe they could randomly deform. But I don't think we can do this in a model. Because if there's an imperfection and the imperfection is like all around the place. I think it would look really weird. Because the imperfection is going to be static in place. Oops. Yeah, I mean especially if it's just once per model ID and not per actual model in the level. There's definitely some fucking collision going around right now. All right, that looks really nice. That looks very ghostly, wow. Let's see. Last model Biobank sent me is the 8-bit pipe. What is the difference? I can't tell. What did you change, Biobank? Oh, you made this just a quarter, I see. Yes, yes, I would like the new boss block very much. Wait, this is one material? Oh shit. All right, that is very nice. There's like four and a half levels left. And the Bowser level and two extra levels, yeah. And then the three overworlds. It's not a problem that it's a cutout. I don't think cutout actually takes longer to render. I don't think it matters. So are we working normal pipe here? Nope. Although I think our normal pipes already look pretty great. I also think we're gonna put all the normal pipes hard-coded into the level in the end. Like I have to just be a part of the model. Just for a tiny bit of performance. You dislike it? I guess it could be a bit more elaborate. Net peanut, all right. Last Biobank model. I feel like we have to make up a new name for him. Because the gargantua block and net peanut are like different names already. A donation! Thank you for the $5 donation. I am glad you enjoy the work. Oh my god. That is such a funny idea. I love it. Oh, he changed his eye colors too. This works way better. That does work better. That is very very cool. You could call him the sludge blarg. Do I get to animate this guy too? Or does he require a little more technical animation? It's very technical animation. I think it might be better if I do it. Okay. He is pretty dark, but I think that's fine. It's kind of the point. He is nothing but oil and sludge. Yeah. But the beams and teeth is genius. Biobank deserves a medal for that. Okay, I think what I am going to change is I am going to use swirl lighting on this. This one looks a bit... This one looks like it's not part of the model. You know what I mean? We can and luckily have shade alpha and vertex colors at the same time. So it's not a big deal. But yeah, this is pretty good. He is beautiful. A gore medal? What? Where is this coming from?  I should change my little graffiti art in this. It matches teeth. Wait. Oh no. Okay, unfortunately this is not something you could have known. But you cannot have vertex colors and environment map at the same time. So lighting has to be on on this material. Otherwise it's not going to work at all. He has two infrared textures so he can scroll in different directions. Oh. That is a cool idea. It's a shame it's prim color. Wait, prim color? Oh. Oh, what the fuck? That could make for a cool effect. Wait a second. How does this work? Shade color alpha. Okay, and there's no shade color. No, no, I just had to make sure that lighting is on here. That's all. Wait, so we could make it so that if you damage him something like this happens. Like it could even go into red. Like, argh, I'm hurt. Brr, brr. Let's drag in these nuts across your face. Is that what you're talking about? Oh. Okay.  Yep, now they receive extra colors a bit more from the level. Which I think is going to look better. Fucked up Yoshi after we go. Shit, I almost forgot this. Oh my god. Oh, he looks fucked up. What happened to him? Brr. Hello Lukas Scheifer. Unfortunately you came basically at the end of the stream. Because I messed up with my boy. Yep, I think he is basically ready to go. I think that's it for today. We have a bunch of new biomodels. I'm gonna have to actually program this. Next time hopefully we can work on Bowser's bureau, Bowser's office. Bonus insane Yoshi of the week since I forgot last week. I've seen this before I think. We did play this. We did. Alright. I'll see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye.
