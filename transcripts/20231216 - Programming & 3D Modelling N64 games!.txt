Okay, we're live on Twitch, that's good, and we're live on YouTube too. Anybody here? Biobak, what is up, gamer? Hello, MarioNova, hello, Imagine.studios, alright, just making sure everything works as intended. Today we're working on the cowboy level. This is what I got so far. We're just doing an art style test, I already have most of the level planned out, we just gotta make sure it looks good now. Hello, Mbaka, hello, SonicTheHedgehog, can you guys see my chat on stream? Yes you do. We got donations set up again, we got rewards set up, we got everything. Course 12, yep, course 12. Howdy. Hello, Droidzica, hello, 2SW. I'm gonna be wearing the hat all day today, because I am a cowboy today, I gotta get in the mood. Yep, chat's back, because we are now multi-streaming to Twitch and YouTube at the same time. Let me get rid of the music here. Did it take that much longer? I don't feel like it did. It took a while, but I don't think it was that long. I think course 10 took just as long. But if you're asking, development has slowed down ever since the end of course 9, because I have a full-time job now. You got a video for me? Feelers of Music, Fun and Heroic, Nintendo Country, Western Edition, let's go! What is the level called? I was thinking Wild West Valley. 18 naked cowboys in the showers at Ram Ranch. Hello Liliana. You know my boss always greets people with howdy. I kind of want to show up to the next programming meeting like this and if they ask why, I'll just say I'm getting in the cowboy mood. Wild West Valley only works in German. How do they pronounce it? Wild West Valley? Is that how you pronounce it correctly? But also Wild West Valley seems like such an obvious and boring name, so I'm thinking maybe it's not good. Howdy. Yep this is a western stage. I got plenty of concept art picked out. This is what I'm thinking the buildings should look like. This is more inspiration for the buildings. This is some for the buildings. More, more, more, are these the same image? They are. That's Yu-Gi-Oh cards I will buy. They are cheap. And of course the hidden village in Twilight Princess. Can you recall my Bebop? No. Where is that? Yeah here we go. Howdy partner. Where are some of the buildings? Yeah, yeah. I see this vibe. Who are the residents company? We've already decided on the entire design of the stage mostly. Let me go over this a little bit. What did I send in this card? Oh right, and Wario's gold mine too. There's gonna be a gold mine in here. Hello maths, Cass. Alright, right, not to forget. We also want there to be some Yoshi Valley inspiration here. And some Western Land for Mario Party. And some Kali Mario Desert. There will be a train in here. Train is guaranteed. There will be two train stations that you can drive between. And the funniest thing I think is I want the NPCs to kind of have the same vibes as like the Cowboy Cats account on Instagram. This is the funniest deck out of all time. Partner, no one's gonna take away your milk, you can get some air. So yes, there will be a saloon and everyone in the saloon will be drinking milk. I did not Lila. Howdy Clayman. Also I really like this floor combiner here. And the wall. They give so much depth to the whole thing. I'm just not a fan of the buildings yet, but we gotta figure out a style for the buildings to look like. All right, let me just keep talking about the design for this. So we're gonna have a bunch of wooden stores. Everything will be surrounded by canyons and mountains. So the whole platforming, it will be like a little canyon valley and there will be buildings stuck in the side of the canyons and you will go around and around to get to the top. And we'll have two train stations, one in the first area and one in the third area. We'll have a saloon, the saloon is where all the guys hang out. We have a sheriff's office, we have a jail, which this whole level is gonna be designed around the idea that you are out there catching outlaws. So there will be three bosses here, they're all small bosses, and every single one of them will be a star. And you will put them in jail after you catch them. And there will be a cowboy head shop, of course, you need a cowboy head shop, a bank and some train tracks. We'll have tumbleweeds, we'll have giant cactuses. I think maybe the egg from Yoshi Valley, I'm not 100% sold on this, but I just think it would be a cool reference. Barrels, fences, dead trees, train tracks, Koopa shell bank, wooden windmill, wanted posters, we'll have wanted posters all over this place. Rocking chairs, and we'll have a train going around the level all the time. The enemies here will be Shy Guys and Cowboy Heads, there will be Snuffits and Cowboy Heads, they have guns on them. Cowboy Goombas, we'll have Pokies, we'll have the bandits from Yoshi's Island. And the buildings beyond the walls of the canyon will be high up like that Cataclysmic Area. I don't know what the Cataclysmic Area is, but probably that's what the plan was. Hello, Sully. More fuzzies. Oh, these are different fuzzies. These are different fuzzies. Um, easier. You should have hidden that one Gif of Luigi dancing with a Cowboy Head somewhere on the stage. I'm not hiding that Gif. Dry bones, probably, and the Monty Ball. The NPCs are gonna be friendly Yoshi Cowboys, while I have Cowboy Toads. I have a Chain Chomp somewhere here planned. I think a Chain Chomp just fits the aesthetic so well. And they all talk to you. Howdy, partner. They all say, howdy, partner. That's how every textbook starts in this. I was thinking maybe a Mouser, definitely Monty Moles. And I want one guy in here that looks really shifty. He like looks around all the time, and when you look away, he moves. He's not a culprit. He's just a red herring, but I think he would be really funny. Maybe he's gonna give you Yoshi Coins somehow. So, we're gonna start with one town area. So town area. Then after the town, there will be a valley area. And after the valley area, there will be the train headquarters. So you can go from the first town to the train headquarters, and from the train headquarters back around to the first town. The train headquarters will have a hidden band cavern. In the main town, there will be a saloon, there will be a Monty Mole bus area, and of course the 8-Bit area, which will be hidden in the canyon area. Would Pit Beverly have used Yoshi as horses? Yes, that was planned, actually. The fuzz should be the Dynamite Joe trope from cowboy movies. Who's Dynamite Joe? Yes, we have bandits from Yoshi's Island planned in here. Hello, Skyloft. Will the cowboys be riding Yoshis or Chain Chomps? The Yoshis are the horses. There's a little farm here that is all Yoshis. But it's never made clear whether the Yoshis work on the farm or whether the Yoshis are the horses. They're more like taxi people, I guess. The town will be full of bad guys. There will be bad guys everywhere. And there's a sheriff, and the sheriff says, I can't fucking deal with this. You go do it. And there are Wanda posters of some bad guys. So the first start, what is planned, there will be a saloon in the first town here, which is what I'm drawing kind of here. By the way, tell me which building you like more. This one here with the slightly slanted walls or that one over there with the straight walls. I think the slanted one has a bit of personality, but platforming on here would kind of fucking suck. Slanted walls is bullshit. Yeah. See, for the slanted wall, I can actually just kind of do this here, which kind of moves the wall into the the the. Yeah, this is actually playable. No, Wari will not be a sheriff, Wari already had the zoo. The saloon will only serve milk. And it looks better. I think so, too. But it's a bit awkward. We have to figure out the right style for the buildings first. Will the NPC make silly sounds? I was thinking of yes, maybe. I also have some funny text that I actually just kind of stole from the cat cowboys account. But like in the saloon, someone could be like, I drank too much milk. Nobody told me cowboys still get tummy aches. Or partner, what's with the get up? What kind of goofy hat is that? Careful, partner. Some of the cow folks ain't right in the hat. This one is my favorite. I'm lactose intolerant, but I still drink milk. Cowboys aren't exactly known for following the law. It's just so funny. Nah, I'm not editing the rap. Diamoness, it's fine as is. He is supposed to be out of universe. Either way, first star in the saloon, there will be a secret room. Once you go in there, there will be like a shootout with the Snuffit. And the Snuffit is like an outlaw that robbed the place or something like that. Second, this one's actually really creative. There will be a Monty Mole that has robbed the bank. He did that by digging in. So when you arrive at the scene, no one knows what happened. The money is just gone. So all you see is like a trail and this trail will lead to the culprit. And then there's a little boss fight with the Monty Mole. The third one is a conductor telling you that there was a train robbery. That was carried out by five Goombas. And no one knows who the culprit is. But there is a really tall Goomba in a trench coat with five cowboy hats on. And he's a little sus because he's wobbling when he walks. So you have to topple him over. And then you find five little Goombas. And they all have these little cork guns here. And they will say, this town ain't big enough for the six of us. And then they will have a little boss fight where they disperse around the town and try to shoot you when you approach them. Add a reference to give me a drink, bartender. That seems like a normal sentence people say. I don't understand. So it's going to be like a murder on the Orient Express scenario. I don't know what that is. I was thinking of having an investigation going on on the train. I think that would be... The roleplay aspect of that would be really cool. But... It doesn't fit Mario 64. Video on the Optimus Train are really something to admire. I recently started playing this material for the first time in like five years. Please don't hate me if you see this coming. I hope you enjoy it. There will be a new video next week about very different things. And cursed codes that you can write to make games faster. Search for the video. I don't want to search for a video that's just give me a drink, bartender. That doesn't even sound creative. I'm not going to reference things I don't even understand. I would never reference something that I don't enjoy. Two bosses is a lot. Can you have a sublime inside the mole's tunnel instead? Because it would make more sense to just follow your trail. Three bosses, actually. And I want that to be three bosses. Can you actually ride the train at any point? Yes, you can go on the train to instantly go from area 1 to area 3. Does meme review mean nothing? Oh, shit. I didn't see that. Alright, is this your meme review? Is that the light skin stare? It's a good meme. Is that a song? Because, dude, I can't actually see the twitch rewards. I wish my chatting combiner app would show me that. Okay, that is funny. Yeah. Yeah, so let's settle on a style for the buildings. This is our timeline. One, settle on a style for buildings. Two, draw a little overhead map of what we want the level to look like. Three, make a block out of the level. Four, make the level look decent. Sounds good. Okay. So, is this actually decent? I feel like the buildings don't pop. I think adding a little bit of shading would make this a little better. Yeah, this building style is just not exciting me. I like these buildings here. But how am I going to make these buildings without completely sucking in Mario 64? If some place where you explain how your level design toolchain works, how you're making it as well as in Blender, there's a plugin called Fast64. You can just export levels from it into Decomp. I don't explain this anywhere. Nintendo took all my tutorials down. I have not played Red Dead Redemption. How big is the level going to be? This is a pretty big level. Steal the buildings from beyond the coast. Well, let's look at that. There's a cowboy level in here? How's it called? Just skip forward in the gameplay. Goddammit. Is it the farm level? Is this the cowboy level you guys are talking about? I feel like no. Cowboy Canyon. That doesn't look like anything. Okay. Where are these buildings you are talking about? I don't see them. Okay. Okay, these are maybe too crazy colorful for my taste. You'd see them if you didn't suck at the game. I'm trying so hard to see them, but I just don't. Is that buildings over there? Let's see if we can get closer to that. It looks like we have to set up the level. Can you just get there, please? Oh. Wait. Wait these buildings is what you want me to do? You fucking with me right? You're making me look like an asshole Biobak. Uh, but giving it the most charitable possible interpretation, I think what you're saying is to make them more saturated. Is that correct? The one town in Twilight Princess, that is mostly what I'm looking at, yes. But that's all, the art style doesn't fit here. You have to turn it blue if you make the gutters all colorful. How many stages are left? I don't know. Those colors kinda suck. They do. That's the problem. We are right now trying to figure out the correct art style for this. It is kinda quirky, but I don't hate it. We have not seen Red Dead Redemption, no. I'm treated hard for buildings in this repair. Damn western buildings. A lot of gutter. I think this kinda fits the Mario Party level. Damn Leela, that sucks. Is this Return to Yoshi's Island, or is everyone using this as Return to Yoshi's Island? I don't really like this, though. Another meme review. This is two minutes long. Okay, it says images only, you lose your points, unlucky. The one where I'm desaturated. I definitely don't like it as is right now. I don't know if making it a little less saturated is the right choice for that. No, I don't think so. I suppose lantern buildings are the clever platforms. They are all platforms, but there are some buildings you can enter, but the doors will look differently. The colorful one next to it is also too pale. While we're trying to find the right style right now, I don't think that turning the saturation knob is gonna be the solution here. We're looking for, to be honest. Although I guess this is not awful. Big show theme, oh right. I already had this video in my list, actually. Why is Mr. Beast doing here? I mean, it's on the ground, because the texture is not matching, creating the sounds might be what's wrong. We need to design it around the sand and canyon texture. Since when are you adding a flat color to the top like you did in IDK? I don't understand what you're asking. These buildings have so much overexposure, it's kinda difficult to understand what they're supposed to look like. I don't want my whole level to just be browns and oranges. What's your opinion on people letting their smoke detectors chime every 15 seconds? We had neighbors like that in our old house, you know what I did? I got a chair, I went outside their window, I put the chair down and I stared through their window. Until they fucking responded to me and put batteries in that thing. Fuck them. It was so annoying. Yeehaw! I like this, I think it's satisfying. Honestly. The more I think about it, the more I like it. No, we can give the buildings different colors, that's not the dealbreaker here. I just remember you had fences with the top part which looked pretty good. Fences with the top part? Oh, are you talking about 3D fences? Is that what you're asking? You're asking if I'm making the fences 3D? 3D? I don't think the ones in Oily Boily Bay were 3D. Fences in Oily Boily Bay? Let me think about that. I don't remember any fences in here. This? That's not a fence, I think. What could Leela be talking about? Oh, do you mean the ones in the underground? Underground? These here? Oh no, they are for 3D. But I do like them a lot more. Yeah, I might want something like that. I'm going to add blue and red orange walls so that the outside pops against the orange but the inside still fits. Wait, oh, that's an idea. But does that make any sense? So you're saying we take this and run all of that? Change the hue here to blue? Why is it not applying? Hello? What? I don't understand. Either way, this should be enough just to see the odds down here. That kinda sounded like what you proposed to me. I don't like it, I think it looks weird. I think we want the inside to pop. Maybe support arcs atop the beams could be more darker, like in the big show. Like this? Don't we already have that? Right here? I'm putting a bank in this hour? Yes. And yes, it will be the Koopa Bank. Yes, I'm streaming on both at the same time, Wufu. No one will care if it's weird, I care. I'm just trying to get a vibe check for this in-game. Let's see how I feel about it once I see it in the actual game. Yes, there will be a saloon. I don't like the red building or the green building, I only like the blue building. That's depressing, I don't wanna just deal with blue buildings. We gotta find the color palette, I think. Answer my question again? Good question. Of course I'm using f3dx3. Well, I'm using a really old version. I don't like that. How about white? That's a wild idea. That's so unhinged. I can try it. It doesn't look white. Why does it not look white? Oh, because I'm using the primitive color as well. Forgot about that. Looks terrible. What's the holdup? What's the holdup? I don't know. What is the big three? Okay, so I just wanna hack my game. I don't know, I have no idea what that even is. I have never heard of this hack. I think my contribution to Universal Conservation, now that I think about it, I think this is the hack where Shine DMed me on Discord, and I was like Do you want to be part of our collab? We want to put your name on it. And I said I don't have time. And then Shine said Okay, listen, what we'll do is you give me two coordinates for metal boxes and I will place these two metal boxes in the level. And that will be your entire section. And I was like, alright. Here you go. Here are my coordinates. Is this the room I'm going to gain Koopas? Yeah, it is. Guys, I actually care so little about the whole Twitch nudity thing, and I don't think it's interesting at all. And I don't know why so many people are talking about it. A bunch of salty MFs. Like, the fuck is everyone on about? Who gives a shit? Just ignore it. Like, how is it affecting me? Maybe it's the thing that would look for the right building on the unpainted parts and keep the bright ones. I don't understand. I can't paint them. I don't own bricks. And these are not bricks. This is wood. We got a sub? Thank you for the primary, Aldo. Appreciate it. I also fixed alerts, as you can see now. Up there, I think. My alert worked. Okay, you know what? I'm just gonna look at more buildings. I think that's the right thing to do here. I got so many suggestions. I think it's better to just look. Makes these buildings work and not work. You know what? Doesn't even make sense to look at this. This scene is ugly. Is it just me? This scene is fucking ugly, right? The building's not cool, but the whole scene composition just doesn't work for me. Same here. This is so incohesive. This is cohesive, but it's just monocolor. This is also boring. Monocolor. I had already opened that one. And this is just a whole different thing. You say Red Dead Redemption is what I should look at. Okay, let's see. Eco Town? This is so not the aesthetic I'm going for. A donation? Thank you for the donation, VegaDose. You now get your song request. Aww. You look like a cartoon, so that could be good. You can make it look happy. You can just embrace it and make everything depressing. No! Yes, cactuses are on my list of stuff to do. I just don't want it to look so monocoloured. I want that to be highlights and stuff. I want it to be fun to look at. This is supposed to be like a goofy, funny cowboy town. Not dark, gritty. ... Don't worry about it, guys. Finding the art style always takes a while. My hand is on backwards? Oh, shit. White and brown. ... White, you say? White is a crazy idea. I've not seen any of these buildings that look white. Dude, red looks like shit. There's nothing in here. The hell? Maybe it makes the colours more reddish? Yeah, but we don't want it to look monocoloured like this one here. I mean, yeah, it's kind of nice but it's not the funny, goofy vibe I want on my cowboy level. You know what? Maybe there's some buildings in the CowboyCatz account that I like. ... This doesn't look too bad. The blue sky is interesting. You think we should have blue skies? ... ... ... Maybe I should give it a little bit of a skybox just to get a better view of it. This is a crazy look. Blue fog and an orange sky. I don't want another sunset level though, we already have oily boily bay and we have the zoo. Well not really oily boily bay, Kuba with Kov actually. They have too much sundown stuff. We need some vibe in this. Another sub! Thank you for the sub, Gaming Life. At least I hope there will be a night I can install. I think changing the lighting in real time is doable. Actually yeah that's fairly reasonable. Maybe our tradition, I don't know if you've seen, is just rank in a desert with no twist whatsoever and doesn't pop. It's just not making sense. No that's not what I'm talking about. Thank you for another donation. It's not about vegetation or whatever, we're definitely going to add some vegetation. But we need the buildings to pop. Not in real time, just an actor takes place on it. Yeah it's doable. The question is, which act would that be? Because there isn't really a story in this one, so it's kind of hard to do. KatoGF? Yes, the game's progressing very well. We're now on course 12. There's no story, we can't do a time progression. It's just a bunch of disconnected missions. I don't want to do another level with a story right now. That's not the vision for this. Okay, this changes the vibe so much. Holy shit. This changes everything. We should have done the sky first. Obviously actually, I should have figured to do the sky first. Let's get the new mixer brown filter. No, that is very expensive on the 64. I am streaming to both at the same time. Who dares DM me? Oh shit, Badub just wrote me. Oh, he got a song. Oh, this is so good. Yo. Oh, that's so perfect. I love this. This goes on for three and a half minutes. Okay. He just sent me that. Yeah, I'm assuming he made this for this level. Oh. That's so cool. Okay. Okay, Voodoo Valley in SM64 menu. That's one way to look at it. But this song definitely makes me think we need to add fog to this level. Wait, that's true. There is also Sand Kingdom. Is there not? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why don't we just take this aesthetic? Oh, that looks like shit. Nevermind. Need some kind of heat wave effect. There has to be a good way of doing that. Maybe with the perspective matrix. Wonder if Fog will help with performance. Nope. The Fog would make the performance worse. Interlacing? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're not doing interlacing. We use shade color alpha here. So we can't have Fog on the scent here.  Doesn't need to have your culling though. Yeah, but we wouldn't use it like that. That would look terrible. Does this program the noise? I would have to program it first. Yes, we will definitely have tumbleweeds. It's noted down right here. Maybe colorfulness drape colors could be one at the color. That's a good chance. Let's drape. Now I need the buildings to stand out somehow against all the brown. I don't want the whole level to be monocolor. That would just look bad. But I also don't want it to look like color vomit. And I don't know how well Fog works. Maybe it has to be monocolor. Maybe it's the sky giving us the blue contrast or something. Hello, honka honka. Howdy, partner. Make them sky blue. The sky is blue. Just use more white. I don't think white fits here. I think making the railings white would look decent. Not at all. Probably not this white. No, I'm not a fan either. Making them look fine. Not really. Yellow. Star blue. No. Could you apply color theory for this level? No. Less water nearby means a paler blue sky. Huh. Really dark chained joints. You can't just. We might have a texture for that. But I also don't think that does much. No, I think for me it's not about just the individual elements. It's like finding the color palette. I'm not thinking of this as a desert, Ryoko. Maybe some other accents. I'm going to look at more wild west towns. I'm going to google goofy wild west town. You know what? Chat GPT, darling. Let's see. Give me a concept art for a goofy wild west town. It should look colorful and vibrant. It's an orange canyon with some sand before. Let's see what it comes up with. This is absolutely not what I want, though. Maybe a cartoon wild west town. That's more like it. These colors. Maybe cartoons are what we should look at. Wait, this actually looks insane. Damn. This is what I want, actually. Howdy, partner. Yeah, GPT is good if you prompt it well. It's the cactus that really does it. It's AI. What's wrong with AI? This is just a wooden version of the odyssey town. Yeah, kinda. The accents need to be more vibrant. Okay, I'm not sure I understand what that means. Are the accents like the wooden parts around it? Maybe I didn't understand that part. So basically, your theory is that the buildings should be like a pretty deep color, something like... Maybe that's too deep. Darker, like... Your theory seems to be that the main buildings should be a color like that, maybe? And then everything else should be a color that's like... A less de-saturated version of... Oh god. A more de-saturated version, maybe. That's not it. I said the same thing, but locally just to see what it spits out. Oh god. I don't think it's going to do anything decent. This is awful now. Oh, actually? The locally versions of this are still good, but it's just turned these into shitty ones. It's almost the same. Howdy, Barna. We just created a blue woman, thank you. It's because the wood I use is so high contrast compared to this, I think. So let's find lower contrast wood. Looks like something from Unity, kinda. And we've already looked at the Twilight Princess Town. It was my first place to look at as well. Those next to the pink house make them stand out, because they're complementary, trying to deal with the different complementary colors that fit the Yoshi-themed green of red. Okay, but if everything stands out, then nothing stands out. That's not the right way to look at it, I'm pretty sure. This is already a lot better, just by making this less contrasty. If small things in a row don't stand out, but they're not composing, then the important buildings will stand out. Yes. I don't understand what you're trying to tell me. Simple shapes make things not stand out, not simple colors. I think simple shapes stand out more. That's my impression, at least. I think maybe these should be the ones with the brighter color, comparatively. Or the more saturated color, and the inside should be desaturated. Yes. Oh my god. Yeah, I still don't like it. I think it's because here it's kind of bordered with the color, while the concept art doesn't. No, it's not bordered. Some parts are bordered and others are not. Others are just solid the color. So that's not what we want. I think. How would it look like if there was a transition between the colors here? I think that looks a lot more reasonable, but still not really good. Make the wood darker and more muted. Darker and more muted. You mean desaturated by muted? I can try it less saturated. I'm not convinced. Why does it look so shitty when compared to the concept art? I should try and understand that part instead. Howdy, actual gamer. Howdy, tyrant. Yes, this is a cowboy level. Not even bringing water? Sorry. I don't see the twitch rewards anymore. It's a bit of an issue right now. I need to figure out a way to prevent that. I think when compared to the concept art, it's just too... I don't know what it is. Also, this needs to come brighter towards the bottom, not darker, I think. So... So... So... Maybe that kind of sky works. Earthworm Jim is a first time level. You can send and I can look at it. Paper Mario 64, the buildings have dirt and cracks in them. There's a western level in Paper Mario? I was just kind of working off this doll yard I generated. Need some highlights. Yeah, that would do a lot. I don't drink. It's such a different vibe though, because this is not... I think it's because this is like the New Mexico color. You know what I mean? Not the New Mexico color, the Breaking Bad, we are now in Mexico type thing. Does that make sense to you? You can have the wall look like that. So... I think this kind of works. Castigoach. Castigoach, Paper Mario. I do not see it. What the hell? Oh, that's not a western town. It's a desert if anything. Germans do drink a lot, but I think drinking is just not a good thing to do. Don't drink, it's that simple. I think the big difference here is that this texture looks too dirty. I think that's just ruining my vibe for this level. Let's get some cleaner woods here. Hello, I'm Eloni. I do want this to be a very stereotypically western town. I want people to look at this and be like, wow, okay, chill out. You know how people that pretend to be Japanese, like weeaboos, how they completely overdo Japanese culture or what they perceive to be Japanese culture? I want it to be that, but for cowboys. I am not a weeb though. So, a cowboyaboo. Yes, I will be a cowboyaboo with this one. I'm not a weeb, but, but why? There's nothing good that can come after that. You are a weeb? Oh, is that the hentai hoodie? I did it for the fans, it doesn't count. A westaboo, yep. Do I not have cleaner woods somehow, somewhere? This wood is a little bit cleaner, but the color is not consistent. This looks like a modern building and not like an old western type thing. Can it be wooden planks like that? Is the problem maybe that I'm trying to do wooden planks at all? Should maybe not be wooden planks like that? I think this is the issue. I think that's why the wooden planks don't work for me. This is also making the buildings significantly more simple, which means I'll have an easier time actually running this on the N64. Fucked up Yoshi of the week, what do we got? Ack, run for your life, what is this? What should the direction be if not wooden planks? Wooden planks. I don't know why you think it should be wooden planks, it absolutely should be. Have you guys ever heard of wereaboos, people that are dressing up like the Wehrmacht? I actually think I should just put this one here because it's not curved. So it's you, you are a wereaboo. So So What am I waiting for? But technically I could Mario 64 with a mouthless I saw this That's such a funny tweet I think this fits so much better with how I want these buildings to look like There will not be a bar fight but something very similar What are you, why not bothing? I think both of why? I know Nathan, don't worry This is not actually what the building is gonna be This is just us trying to find the art style Although no no no no this building here looks so different from this I don't think we can have both in the same level The art style just doesn't work together Like, this building is cool and all but it just doesn't fit with the style of this building I find And then we need to replace these here because this is just not looking good than what I'm standing on I think that's ruining the style here What do you think? Is the style viable? That is the question I think we might want to add some more brown to this Hello Neon the programmer Looking pretty cozy No way am I actually just gonna go back to this? Pain I think the blue surrounded by brown just looks really good And I think that would look the same if we made more buildings like this But I don't like the top part here And I think blue surrounded by darker blue could look good as well Like what if we just changed this here to a darker blue and not all of the same picture Like only these bars here Darker blue always looks terrible Let's see, let's add red to the blue So purple We can add something to it I'll make the terrain brighter. The terrain is as bright as it can be, I'll turn some lights on. Actually I'm already turning lights on. I kinda like this. Hello Maya Sunshine. Hello Tanya Retro. I don't want different cars in the same building. For me, what's kinda looking shitty is the roof. I don't like the roof. Other than that, I like this. There's also the issue that the windows are not gonna render fine. That's a huge issue actually. We might need more triangles for that. Hello Luke Harvey Kit. Sorry, I don't have the answer to that. Akita reproducing a low-poly surround sound is a very interesting perspective. Honestly, most of the N64 games look the way they look because of the skill at the time. And not really because of the limitations of the console. But if you really want the N64 limitations, just stick to 64x64 textures at most I guess. The thing is, you're not allowed to say that back then there was a skill issue. Because then people will be like it was 96. A vertex painter. Okay, we're on the N64. Do you think we can add a vertex painter? So what do you guys think of the art style for the buildings now? We're not gonna use these buildings by the way. These are just here to be like, this is what the level could look like. Does it look good? We're not using these buildings. Because you guys keep telling me to change specific parts of the building, we're not using them. We're trying to get the art style right. What's dark? We're too dark. Oh, like this part here? The brown ones. This one. Yeah, that looks a little friendlier. I think the yellow building looks really good. Oh my god, the corn just said that we're not using these buildings. We're trying the art style. We're not using them. These buildings, we will throw them in the trash. These buildings do nothing in the level. They are just there so we can look at them and be like, yes, do these colors look good or not? These are being thrown away. We should also listen to the song again. Does this image fit with the song? Let's see what other colors would work here. To see if this is good enough. Green looks a little off. That's the concept of having green in it. Very de-saturated. Red doesn't look good to me. Pink looks fine. So I guess we have to gradient from here to here. And then this part here. So what if we do something more neutral? It has to have the same saturation. Purple looks okay too. Is that all it is? It's just one spectrum on the left and one spectrum on the right. The HSV slider. What is teal? You mean like turquoise? Is that teal? It's just blue to me. Do you like these colors more? This is not very Mario-like to me. That's why we don't want that. Next let's play with some fog. I don't want the fog to fade in all the way. So I'm just going to do a 970 to a 985. Does Odyssey not have any buildings like this? No, Odyssey buildings are similar. Biobak said the same thing. He said this is just Odyssey. Zayna just came home with a new house.    I can hear her talking to someone. Who could she be talking to? Why does the fog not render correctly? Do I have to enable it here? Oh, we're out of music. Enjoying life in a wooden cabin? Yeah, that's pretty much what I'm doing. A wooden basement more like it. Oh wait, this needs to be over 1000. This one doesn't work as this. We need a different combiner for this one. That should look good enough. I don't understand what this combiner is. I'll be honest. I love a Skelenio. No way she would talk to Skelenio without me. I need to have a single triangle that sets the fog. I always do this in my levels. It's just a single material here. Call it... Call the whole thing like... And then... We add a material to it. This will be... C12 fog. And... Set this to color fogged. That's nothing. Global fog. Nothing. Only render. And this will set the fog for the level. Hello, Lord Farthamore. Shame. I hate that set fog. Oh my god. Unfortunately, this means everything is going to be a 2-cycle material. Which is really, really bad. We've already experienced this in Oily Boily Bay. There might not be anything we can do about it. It might just look so good that we have to take the loss. Okay. Look at it. Hello, Elaphie. Why would you do it like this? How would you do it? Tell me how to do it faster. I don't know. Usually they have orange fog. I think the fog looks really good. Although we might want to make it a little more intense and a different color. I am using Fast64's global fog. What are you talking about?  No! Let's change it here. This is the start of Course 12. I don't see any fog. Open your eyes. What did I prove? Oh. I proved that Lila exists. I didn't even see you. Howdy, partner. I don't see any fog.   Maybe orange fog would look better than blue fog. But maybe blue fog would look better. You know what I mean? It's just in the afternoon here. 980 and 140. I don't see any fog.         We're making a cowboy level. Howdy, partner. How can't a cowboy level have yellowish fog? Yeah, that's a good point. But the skybox is so white. What? Such a white skybox. It just feels natural to have this type of fog. Let's name the dinosaur level again. Dino Dino Land or something. Please teach me nutrition for bodybuilding. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. And I can post this a few above my bed. You need... You need good protein. Usually... Actually, it wouldn't be enough. It's just like 30 or 40% of your macros. It's just like... Protein. And then another 30 to 40 is carbs. And the last 30 to 40 is fat. And you'll be fine. Nutrition is actually pretty simple for bodybuilding. Unless you want to be like 100% perfect. Then you can make it very complicated. I think I like the blue fog. Let's try orange fog once. See what I like better. Do you maintain your energy if you have to eat more as a whole for exercise? Depends on whether you're cutting or bulking. Usually when I bulk, I have a bit more carbs. And when I cut, I have a lot more protein. So right now I'm bulking. And I only have like 30% or so protein. But once I'm going to be cutting, it's going to be like 45%. I think the blue fog looks better. Oh, maybe this one. Let's listen to the music for this level again. Dude SimpleFlips, open your ears, this is so fucking sick. I'm gonna look forward to the sec forever. This song gives me Yellowfuck vibes though. Hmm. The fuck is that bass? And that bloom looks so good, fuckwise. I'm so undecided on this. Am I using a soundtrack yet? I don't know. Yeah, this just gives me... this is just like... What's the word for this? Like, look at the canyon here. Like, holy shit. It's so nice. Dude, the way the file select theme is in the song is so insane. I think we can go with the style. I think Bluefuck is good to go. I think we're ready to move on to the next step, which is MS Paint. Skip the level that MS Paint figments and figure out what goes where. 16 notes as a football song? No way. Loop the music. Nah, music's over. Back to two plus hours of fun and heroic Nintendo Country Edition. Actually, let's look at Sand Kingdom too. Before we move on, actually, let me just make sure what Sand Kingdom looks like. They have a white fog. Their fog is white and their sand is just fucking red. You might hate me for this, but I think this looks like shit. I don't like this at all. It looks good, really? I like the skybox, but the sand being so red. I don't know. I think this whole aesthetic is hard carrying by the automatic lighting their engine inserts. I guess it's a refraction zero noise. But we can't do that on N64. I can change Mario's jump sound to a yiha, yes. I was actually planning to import a yiha sound for the ground pound jump. Yeah, I don't really vibe with this as much as I do with this kind of aesthetic. Okay, I don't think we missed out on anything by not looking at this so much. So we can move on. So for the MS Paint stuff, MS Paint Step, we have to plan out how the level looks like. We have a town area on one side, then we have a valley, and then we have the train headquarters. And we need those to be connected. We have one train in the town area and one train and train headquarters, and you can fast travel between them, basically. We need a saloon in here, in the town. Um, I think we can just do the valley and the farm area later and not worry about it right now, and only do the town. Which needs an entrance to the valley. Maybe we can do this be an instant warp, but I'm not sure. He suggested what? Limington. The train station could take inspiration from Paper Mario 64. I don't remember though. But I want this to look like a western train station. So this is fine. Um, area six, the Monty Mole boss area. Right, so there's the boss fight here, that you can enter by following a mole trail. Bridge and one stone needs to be saved to train when the bridge is bombed. What do we need in here? Let me just think about this. We have to start next to the jail. So let's just put down the jail here. Back, then Mario start has to be here. We need this so that you can get the deeds on what your goal is on this level instantly, and the roleplay starts early. So this needs to be the very first thing that happens. You talk to the guy in jail. Um, we don't want the player to miss this. So Mario has to be looking straight at the jail at the start. I don't like that you kind of start on the corner of the level. I would prefer if this was open. So what if instead of this actually, the way we do it is... The jail is here. Mario starts like here. And then you can go to the left or the right and there will be more stuff here. And there's just like a wall behind the jail. We need the saloon and we need the sheriff's office. I guess that is kind of where the jail is as well. So... Sheriff's office. Good enough. You can read this. We have a bunch of wanted posters. Should be a clock tower in the center of town. Clock tower? What does that do? I want that to be windmills in here. We want a cowboy head shop. We want a bank. Wooden stores. And we need an area to the next entrance. Train station. The train station should be at the opposite end of the valley entrance. Just so it's faster to move along. So the valley entrance should probably be like here. Area two. And the train station needs to be like here. Just to ensure that works out. I do kind of want this to be a thing you can go in a circle in. So what if we make this all go in a circle and there's a huge thing in the middle? If there's a huge thing in the middle, we can cut everything that's far away. So what if this whole city was kind of around a mountain? That would work well for the N64. Because of how much culling it allows. Sounds good. I think that sounds good. Wait, someone wrote me. Might be important. Hmm, something like that. Classic reverse donut. Kinda, yeah. You're inside the donut. We can also just have this be a U-shape with a little tunnel in between. I do kind of like the idea of a little tunnel. Makes the mountain more cohesive as well, I find. Would the tunnel have a point though? What could be in the tunnel? It could be a saloon that leads through the mountain. What if we make the saloon go through the mountain? So you can enter one side of the saloon and come out the other. Because the saloon is like the central piece of this whole town. So it would make sense if that was enterable from both sides and you were forced to enter it through like either way you go. Make a train tunnel. Oh, a train tunnel is cool too. Maybe it should be a train tunnel. You know what? Why not get a train tunnel? Always better than the saloon. It's gonna be something like this. An old train track. It's gonna be kind of like this. Maybe a soft wall here. The question is, wait, if this is a train tunnel it's not, it's gonna be really boring to traverse it. How do we make the train tunnel not boring to traverse is the question. Or we make it so you can't traverse it, but that's also very lame. Platforming. But it's a train track, you can't platform on the train track unless you want the train that derails instantly. It's a bit of a problem. Then there would be mountain here too. I do want that. I do not want the train to derail. Riding a train through it. No, you enter the train on the train station. I want there to be a train that moves permanently around the town. But it doesn't work like that. Above around the track. Why would you want to go there? Can you archive all these concept sketches? Yes. You can have gates that rise every time a train passes through. So you can only enter when riding on the train. I want the plane to be able to go around. Honestly, I want the train to have more of a presence in a level. What if the train tracks also went through here? I want that. How do I mark this? Sky train tracks. I want there to be a second layout of train tracks that just goes through here. And then it's this way. So we got this wall figured out. It was a desert and the ground was stable between the areas. So you can walk there on foot and the music stops. And it's super liminal and there's a dino skeleton. Oh skeletons would be really cool. I like that. I'm gonna make a note. Dino skeleton. It should be an area too. Because see the way it works is you can actually just ride the train to the third area. But you can also walk to area two and then walk to the third area. I mean this is not about logic. This is about cool. Rule of cool. It's the rule here. Still how do you make the train travel fun? Can we just have the train tracks be in the sky instead of in the mountain? Like what if there's a mountain here and this is in the sky? And then there's a train station here and then there's a wall here. I think that works a lot better. I'm gonna do that. And then you can platform around them in the sky. Train tracks are in the sky above Zubor, two beams. And then I'm gonna mark the depths on little red. I think I like that better. It's not claustrophobic. You can see you will be able to just platform around here and get to the train station from the other side if you want. But it's less boring this way. We don't want this to be boring. It's also a bit easier to render this way. When you make floating train tracks not look weird, you just fade them out towards the bottom or make them into the mountain. Floating train tracks does feel like a marching track to put in the game in a bad way. Okay, just wait. Okay, wait. Actually, I have the ultimate counterpoint. Are you ready to be destroyed with a single image? Lip tarts in shambles. The Varys goldmine is one of the things we want to take inspiration from. It doesn't go through a canyon anymore. This one. Oh, well, it does go through a canyon, actually. Actually, this is just like Varys goldmine's train tracks. Don't worry about it. This will be fine. We got this. We got that. We got the sky train tracks here. Just going into the mountain. We got skyline train tracks here. We got some here, here. This goes away here. You cannot reach this. How do I mark that this is too high up? Maybe just like a brown line. Brown line here. So the train track is over the valley and the city is down in the valley. No, there are some train tracks that are here in the valley. Like here. And they are on the same height as the floor here. But there's also train tracks in the sky here above the start. And you will see the train just come by. Maybe I should draw this out a little bit. Like so. That's what I'm thinking. Right. So you will enter the level. There will be a jail in front of you. And if you just stand there, you will see the train drive over Mario. And the train is just going to go into the other side of the mountain. And then maybe another train is coming from here. And then we still have to do some height modulation everywhere around here. It will be a very nice looking scene. No they are connected. This train goes out here and comes back here. But you don't see that. Like everything past here will be off screen. Like all this stuff here, not visible. Same here, not visible. Forest Goldmine has canonically large pipes out of bounds for no reason other than that. Yeah, this is weird. I don't think I want to copy this, but the buildings here are nice. Where's the goldmine area though? Here in area 2 you get to a valley and after the valley there's a train station and that's where the goldmine is. This is just area 1 of 7. Although the other areas are smaller, obviously. We need some wooden stores around. I guess we can just put random buildings around. We have a sheriff's office here. The saloon is very important. The cowboy headshop is important. The bank is important. So there are 3 important buildings we still need to find places for. I do want to make sure that the saloon is very center. The one ring goes for the one in the middle. No, nothing goes for the one in the middle. This is solid. As if I could correctly place someone close to each other at different heights Mario would need to achieve different kinds of jumps. That could be a neat idea. We'll see about the Yoshi coins later. See, I was thinking behind the mountain at the center would be another area. I don't know. When deemed there, ask a Scooby question everyone. You should check their message out. Oh shit, what is it? I missed it because I am not in the Twitch chat actually. I am using a chat combiner. Where's the question? What is the question? Shit. Sorry, someone will need to ask that question to me again because I didn't see it. Hello Beta. Beta, we need cowboy songs. Howdy partner. Having a caveman and you have to use dynamite to enter the goldmine area would make so much sense. I don't like puzzle elements like that for Mario, especially when you have to carry around items. But there is a goldmine area where people are being dipshits and that's where the 8 word coins are actually. There will be some cards to drive around in as well. Maybe I should note that down. Bandits, Slytherins, minecarts to the right, train tracks, or rather mine tracks. Yeah, support beams has plant here. Superchat, 2CAD, decomp or Remenger or Hackamari64. Hackamari64 is a version of decomp, but I hate it. I prefer base decomp, but if you're new to hacking, Hackasm64 is probably the easiest. Wait, there's superchats here and I don't see them? Oh my god, now I feel bad. What if someone superchatted and I missed it? Oh, Orson7? Don't alarm him to my stupid joke question. What was it? Please let me go up a rail where the gold cards come from and hide over there. We need Mario Kart Wii. We usually hide concept art in secret passages that you can only reach with sick tricks. Are you doing this for Mario? Why aren't you doing so, Nick? Oh, it's because Sonic fucking sucks. Except for Sonic Adventure 1 and 2. Actually, even those games are bad, but I like them. But every other Sonic game is just unplayably bad. Okay, saloon. Needs to be very visible, needs to be a giant building. Needs to be very obvious. I'm trying to think of how this area looks right now. There needs to be some upward in this direction or maybe downward? Does downward make more sense? No one doesn't. This and this side need to have roughly the same height. Classic Sonics are the worst ones in my opinion. Do you know if the old streamlamps- I actually updated them today, so it should work better. Could make a good shroom. Actually no, I think Sonic is irreconcilable. A huge fix would be to zoom the fucking camera out so you can actually see what you're playing. Actually. You can take the train to travel, yes. I think the saloon would actually fit best here. Because this area is one that you should rarely visit. When do you visit this area? Mission 1 is in the saloon's secret room. Mission 2 is under the bank. Mission 3 is the conductor telling you about the train robbery. So we can actually have the sasgoomba anywhere. So there's three missions in the town. Okay, the one we actually need to plan out the most is the Monty Mole mission. Because the Monty Mole mission will have a large trail that goes throughout huge parts of the level. See us, Zelda? Yeah, actually we had a sub earlier better and it showed up on stream. So it should work. What are the conditions for the mole? Oh, we can narrow this down. It needs to be confusing when you don't know what it does. Donation! From Beta! Yeehaw! Will there be a plague? No. Oh, cowboy songs! It's been so long. Okay, it needs to be confusing when you first see it. It needs to be continuous. There can't be any jumps in height. Home! She burps at that part of the song so she censored it so I need to sing it. Okay, I have to... But the train station already has a star. Maybe the bank should start here and then just go some secret path and lead somewhere in here? Something like... Like so? Okay. So this would be Monty, mole, hideout. This would be bank. And I guess it makes sense for the Sudun to be right next to the bank. The Sudun should be a giant building. Saloon? There should be some height leveling like...  Here? Uh... Definitely here. Probably here. The train station should be on a height bump. There needs to be one below the Skytrain tracks actually. And there could be some stuff here for random stars. What random stars do we have left? Right, head shop. Head shop. Now where would the sassy Goomba fit? That's funny, Mayo Sunshine. And yes, that was probably also requested by Beta. Oh, she sang the country roads. So this is all train station. Saloon is here. Where does the sassy Goomba fit in all this? Maybe over here? Oh, banger, song alert. Sassy Goomba. Okay, there's a Goomba who is a giant and in a trench coat. So there's a storyline going on here. That five Goombas robbed a train and no one knows who did it. And there's one Goomba in a giant trench coat with five cowboy hats on and he wobbles when he walks. So something's up with the guy. Maybe this is five Goombas in a trench coat. Basically you have to figure out how to figure out that he is the suspect. Another song donation. Thank you very much. Oh, there are no actual cats here. It's just the cats are just like the inspiration for the dialogue. Could actually have another height step here. So there's a flat path to take, but there's also just all these height steps you can take. Oh, this path is very long and flat though, actually. Something like that is probably what we need. Another one like that. I'm so getting banned from Twitch for this one. This has the getting banned from Twitch vibe. I don't want NicoTales. Maybe the Sassy Goomba should be in the second area. There's two stars here. In the second area there will actually be a scavenger hunt. I didn't even mention this. Howdy partner. We're making a cowboy level. We have to be in the mood for it. The second area is the scavenger hunt, which means there will be a sign. You will read it and it will give you a hint. You will go there, round pond, and then it will give you the next hint. The next area is going to be a traversal area to get to the third area if you want to walk there. It also has the scavenger hunt mission, which means we have a lot of freedom in how we do the movement. We can just have this be a playground. The whole thing is just a huge playground and you can go wherever you want. It's going to be really cool, I think. I'm a cowboy-a-boo. A west-a-boo. The conductor, mall, and the saloon are on the first mission. Right. I think we should move the Goomba to area 2. The five Goombas in the trench coat hang out in area 2. Try not to lose us. Or maybe in area 3. Does area 3 work better? It's at the other end of the train station. And I feel like you're going to associate the big train station more with it. Around the train station. Last time I was here was three months ago. I do not remember you. I have no idea who you are. Hello, XPM. My name is Case Johnson. And I have a donation. Holy shit. More Texas time?
