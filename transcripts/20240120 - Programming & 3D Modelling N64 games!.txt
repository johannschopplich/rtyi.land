Hello, Biobak. Late? Dude, my OBS crashed. What can I do? I finished importing most of the level now. Got some cool stuff done. Hello, SBK. I'll show you what I have so far. Real quick run through. Still gotta do the background. The background's gonna make this level go from like 9 out of 10 to 10 out of 10. Did I change anything from what you've sent? I changed the Shy Guys a little bit, because they had like an effect on it. Right, you see how they're blinking? I had to change a bunch of combiners because they all had environment color and it made everything look very dark. What did I change? Oh, I was working on a new flame model that had some particle effect. It's very much in progress. Let's see. I don't think I changed anything about this thing. Oh yeah, I did change this part here a little bit. I think it gets too dark. Let me fix it real quick. Hello, Zelda. Hello, Beta. Happy birthday to you as well. Where did the vertex shading on the carpet go? There was a vertex shading on here? I did not remove it, at least not intentionally. Oh my gosh. I don't know why it's gone. Oh, maybe it was because it was drawn on the wrong layer. It's fine. I can copy that back, I think. Or I just have to redo it. I gave this net physics here, too. I wrote a generic function for this now, so this is super easy to add to anything. See, we're adding shading on it. Yeah, it probably went away, because the layers were named differently and I merged them together. I had to reduce so many condition vertices. Holy shit. I still gotta finish the jelly block here. But it's already looking pretty fun. Hello, Clayman. Did I change anything else? I think I imported the barrels right, but I'm not sure. Oh, these are missing the texture. Oh, I know why. Let me fix that real quick. Since last stream, my girlfriend's mom had to go to the hospital. It turns out... That's fucking depressing. Hello, 24. It's going well. Hello, Skyloft. Hello, Vasa. The jelly looked like a really fun element. How long did it take you? Probably like an hour or two, maybe. I think I made it on stream. It didn't take very long. Yeah. So these, yeah, they're missing the lighting flag. That's why they look like that. The age old issue. I see what the intention was. Yeah. What we could do is like... That to kind of make them look like that. It's true, 7up. Although even the movement has a lot of little issues everywhere. But yeah, I'll definitely need to re-vertex color the carpet. It's fine though, I think. Either way, today we're going to be working on the saloon again. Hashi. Hello. The name is MagnificentKirby24. Oh, okay. I just see Japanese letters and then the 24. So... I cannot read Japanese. I guess I'll just call you Kirby as long as I remember that that's your name. The ads got through to your adblocker? No! What are you making today in the saloon? We got a sub! B-Turk, thank you for the sub! To texture multiply by prim in Sega 1 and combine color minus text 0 color. I'm going to shade it with a 0 color and you can repaint the color on the texture. Yeah, I can do that. How do I get this checked as soon? Just forgot. Oh, one cool thing I didn't showcase yet. We have new dialogue cutscenes. You see that? I should add that to my in-case clips list. I have a list of clips I need to upload. The lightnings are in the... Dude, look at this! Oh, something's fucked up with Mario's cap here. Why does Mario's cap look fucked up when I'm in here? Oh, that's really weird. Oh, because it's a decal. Maybe? I don't know. Um, any OST wishes for today? So today what we have to do is we're gonna have to make the secret room in the saloon. I also gave them all texts already. Hey, skedaddle! And then there are 65 minutes of Freddy's Run Mega. I don't think it's ever been done. I feel like robots done that. There's also a Five Nights at Freddy's just N64 ROM. Dillon's Rolling Western. All right, let's do it. Megatech just always worked on N64. Although this thing James Lambert has done is very... Like, it's very cool. It's a cool technical thing, but it's always been possible. Why the air sparking? That's dust. So yeah, the next part is gonna be a secret door right here. We're gonna go through it and then we'll cut into a room where a bunch of cowboys are hanging out and they're secretly drinking choccy milk, which is illegal in this world. We still need a bunch of milk bottles and stuff and Zeyna said she wanted to give those to us, but I guess she forgot. That sucks. Howdy mate! Howdy partner! Thoughts on the comment I left on the last video. To have it be like a secret room, I think it's a good idea to have a secret room. A full 360 degree. I can kind of see it, but what I like about the current camera setup... I don't think I've showcased this, but there's one very cool mechanic to this. And that is if you need an exact angle, you can like... You know, let's say I want to go directly into the pipe perfectly, but I can do this. And I like that a lot and I feel like that feels more natural with third-person Mario. Although I guess perfectly first-person would work too. I guess there aren't many disadvantages to it. Keyboard players will appreciate that. Yeah, this is very useful for keyboard players. When folding the L button down triggers full first-person. I think the transition is fast enough that some grand mod players will do that on accident. I don't know. I mean, I'm still considering just going full first-person. I don't think there's much of a disadvantage to it. In fact, we already have a full first-person thing for when you have the Yoshi hook, so we probably should do that just for consistency. Are you a grand mod player? I don't know. How long do you usually hold the button down when you press it? I remember there was a ROM mech where the button wouldn't work if you hold it down for just one frame and it would never work for me. And everyone else was saying it worked for them and they thought it was like my PC, that's the issue. But it wasn't. They're just all really bad players. That's true, honestly. That's why it's the first-person button. You basically don't need that unless you're standing still. Well, this is not how the areas are laid out right now. Okay, scan out, I'm left-handed, but I am working on stop-motion emission soon. A lot of tricks to I don't think I remember saying it. Yeah, I'm saying that the cutscene to do that is so short that some people are going to accidentally do that by a mic. That's why I don't like it. I think I'd rather make it so that it always goes in full first-person mode. Maybe. I'm not 100% sure that I will do that. I actually should copy this layout from here. Yeah, that's true. But like I said, you've already mostly convinced me. I'm like 90% sure it will be better. I'll actually have to try it. How far did you get with the pirate ship? The pirate ship is mostly done. I'm just missing a few jelly block animation frames. I want to program new flames that look better there, and then it should all be good. I don't think I understand the question. I am always rolling.  LibDragon performs very poorly right now, so I definitely do not want to port it to LibDragon. But there are a few LibDragon features that I might port into Orgy.ai. I actually talked to the LibDragon dev every now and then about optimizations. We shared different ideas on how to implement 10 and stuff like that. The colorblind improvements on the boxes are really cool. I like it a lot. I did not see the new piano yet. I have not taken the time to look at it. So well, of course, I'm going to talk to the devs if it's about the optimizations. But really, it's not that we have DMs or anything. It's just that we are in the same Discord server. We just happen to be in the same conversation. I found the reason the Kirby 64 doesn't lag. It's the fact that there's no real overlay. Why did I think booleans were the problem? Did they test it or just a little spice? I don't understand. No real overlay? Hello, Super Mario 64 fan. Do you perchance like Mario 64? Yeah, I'm pretty sure the main reason Portal 64 actually got cancelled is because the guy really wanted it to be officially accepted by Valve. And not that he wasn't able to work at it anymore. He just found out Valve will never accept it and then he just kind of lost all the motivation. In my opinion, that's what's happened. Hey, don't diss Mario 64 fans, Hoshi. Nothing wrong with watching on YouTube. Of the N1 lib ultra being used? Yeah, I don't know if that's true either. I don't think it really concerns them. Do you see why it was the reason that the N64 lagged? Having all the layers overdraw. That's what you're talking about. But yeah, in Kirby 64, since it's 2D, you know the depth of everything beforehand, so you can render everything without depth and without overdraw. Which would help a lot. You made a demo of the UI and then they said the final release will be in 2022. But 2022? I feel like I never said that. No way. I used to believe that it might come out in 2023. Did I say that? Somewhere past 2022. Okay, sometime after 2022. That's not in 2022. That is explicitly not in 2022. What are you accusing me of? Hello, Space Walker. You are welcome for the background noise. It will release in 2017 and have more content on the scene. No! Dude, I have heard someone say that I started development in 2017. That was depressing to hear because I didn't. I made like three major X in 2017 to the time Rty started. Is the Rty name sticking at this point? I think so. Relic Gold sets me, I think, for levels that don't have one of the coloring. They should have the altering animation. Everything will have an animated one. It started in 2020, I'm pretty sure. Like mid-2020. Yo, thank you for the 500 bits. Less than free. Is the warp door different? And that's why it looked weird. I need doorknob 2, the normal doorknob scales. Did I even go through the fucking door? I don't remember. Is there an actual reason to put this into a separate area? Just because of lag. Could be a room system, but I think it's easier to just put it in a separate area. I don't think that's going to break immersion. These areas are going to look very different from each other. Yeah, it does have a thing for not processing actors. Right, I gave this one ignore condition. Now I see the issue. I think this will work now. My room system skips processing actors. I actually improved that algorithm recently. It's a lot better now. I think a bit of lag is gone from that. But yeah, it's really just because I think it's easier like this. I hate when that happens, Ashi. Hey, it won't work. Wouldn't it be good to highlight that door so it's more obvious? No, it's hidden on purpose. This is the secret area. But all the NPCs in here talk about the hidden door, basically. So the idea is that you go into this bar and you're going to inform yourself about the outlaws and some of them. The important characters will turn towards you so you know who to talk to if you just want to make progress. But some of the characters will tell you that there's a hidden door under somewhere and then you will find it, right? It's purposely made to blend into the environment. Dude, Leela is the same. I grew up in such a small room. You know what's even worse? I grew up in a bed that was too small for me. Have you ever tried sleeping in a bed that is too small? Literally torture. Yes, this is a saloon. I had to sleep like diagonally to fit in. It looks like someone has stars a little bit as if it looks like an owl. Theoretically but I feel like it would also look weird. Maybe I don't know. Yeah, be sure to remember that one. Have you guys seen the image of someone having an aquarium and there's just three giant goldfish in there that are way too big for the aquarium? That's what it feels like. Yeah, dude, the plank. Bats shouldn't have a plank at the back. I said it. So okay, what's going to happen is when you come in here, there's going to be a bunch of shy guys around the table and the shy guys are drinking chocolate milk, which is considered illegal and they will be like, oh shit, they caught us. Let's get out of voice and they will run off and your goal will be to chase after the shy guys. I just haven't really thought about the actual shape of this area yet. Yeah, I'll make my own platformer hacker. The router was underneath your crap. The baby that grew up on 5G. And he turned out fine. So this is supposed to be inside the canyon. So I think I want this to transition to canyon vaults and have this feel like a cave system. The question is just how do we best make this mission work? At first I was thinking that they were going to run away from you, but shoot at you continuously and you have to just chase after one guy. But I feel like just one guy is not good. So maybe you should like kill five shy guys in this cave system and they're just running around shooting you when you get near them. But that's very similar to the Goomba mission that we have. So I don't like that. There's some cool shit we can do with the cave system. We'll definitely have a table here and guys sitting around. That's for sure. And then I think these will already be cave vaults. So let's just do something like that for now. So you just remember. What about a tactical shooting mission where you go and snipe them without them seeing you like a real shooter in minecart? They do not sell burgers and fries. Tactical shooting mission. I like it to still be platforming based is the thing. I don't really want to give Mario a gun. I don't want to use fucking linux splacer. Why would I want to use linux? Literally give me one reason. A race? Nah. Well, I mean, yeah, you're kind of racing after them. Just kind of like MIPS. This is a cave system. So the cave could form a ring. Chasing them in a minecart with jumps and dodging the bullets they send you subway surfer style. Oh, I see what you mean. So we have them at the table and then they just run off, hop into minecarts and you jump after them also in a minecart and it just kind of goes in a circle. I guess when you get hit, you slow down and when you don't get hit, you like slowly catch up and eventually you caught up to all of them and have to fight them on like a final platform I guess. Something like that is what I'm thinking. It could work. So we'd have them here, they would run like over here and wait for you, you'd follow them and then as soon as they see you, they hop into the minecart and you also hop in the minecart. What happens if you wait too long? They should probably just wait like a thousand or two thousand coordinates out of vision. Okay I don't use native linux because I don't need to. That's the answer then. I just use WSL because I need to. Ideally, I would use as little linux as possible. Yeah, so I like the minecart idea. We could have like three minecarts and like three rails and they would like go forwards and Mario could jump between the minecarts to make progress. We probably force the camera to just be behind him and then the track would be mostly random generated I think. And I guess they shoot at you and you have to dodge the shots. Is this gonna be time-based? How do you make it faster? When you catch them, both minecarts fall off the rails in the depths where you fight them in a cave way below like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like that. That sounds very cool. I'm not cracking my knuckles, at least not consciously. Whoops. Maybe I did crack my knuckles. Hello, film and floor. Okay, film and floor. Nice ramp. I don't need to smurf. Thank you very much for this piece of information. I will not smurf then. Okay, this gives it some cave-y shape. This will be wood and then suddenly cave. Oh, that's my knuckles. Yeah, you're right. I was cracking them. What are you even making? This is the secret cave where they drink chocolate milk. Okay, let me think about the technical implementation of this. Starting a cutscene when they see you, very easy. Playing an animation, having them run off, very easy. They wait at the minecarts, which will be right next to this, also easy. Then the minecarts themselves. We need to make this interesting somehow. It can't just be like an even thing. Or it can just be an even thing if you really want to. Maybe this should just be an actual 3D modeled minecart track instead of something procedurally generated. And the challenge is getting to the end without taking too much damage or falling off. How do we kill Mario when he falls off the track? Do we just fade him out like, oh, you can't catch up anymore? I think that makes sense. Now getting to the end. If you get to the end and there's a hole, the player will try to avoid the hole, I'm pretty sure. How do we deal with that? Yes, this is for the cowboy level. Okay. Only one star stun in the cowboy level so far. Well, you already do that anyway. Just so you can avoid the minecart falls off the rails because they're cut off and you're just right after. Yeah, I know, handkerchief. We have a handkerchief type level kinda actually. It costs three. Man, we have so many minecarts in this game. The hell? Oh, wait, this is my controller. Maybe you heard my controller cracking. Not my knuckles. By leaving the game, the game fled into the bar. Nope. You can afford three minecarts. That's true. I'm still not sold on the falling down part. I guess the shy guys fall in. What if that instead of them just falling in, you just naturally end up like deep down in a cave? Like that's just the end of the road. I think it should just be the end of the road without falling in. That's the cleanest way to make this work. That's not that down. They run off into three minecarts. Minecarts that follow and Mario can jump on them. If you jump on them too slow, they wait just outside of vision behind a curve for Mario to hop in. Just cheat this in code. At the end of the minecart track, there's just a fight with how many free guys? Free guys and you get a star for leaving them. Or maybe there's not a fight at all and they just give up. It's more cinematic if you all fall down together. That's true. I just can't make any sense of it. My keyboard is that loud? Dang. Not much I can do about that. I mean, I don't on purpose have my keyboard sound on stream. I mean, yeah, you have a good point with the cinematic stuff, but I just can't make any sense of it. I just can't make any sense of it. At the end, they just get into jail like that's it. Yeah, I think we can make this work from here. I don't have any special keyboards. I just have like I usually always get the cheapest thing that works like with anything in life. And the same is what I've done with my keyboard. I don't value having expensive stuff at all. You know who I think of when I see people wearing like expensive watches or expensive clothing? I think of Elliot Rodger, the fucking incel mass murderer that killed a bunch of people because he couldn't get laid. Because that's like the one guy that I know that would always try to buy expensive things because he thought women would be impressed with that. That's who I see when people I see people buying expensive things. I'm so sorry to anyone who owns expensive things right now. It shouldn't be associated with that guy. Why is that your first thought? Because that's the only guy I know that buys expensive things to impress women. No, that's not why I don't buy expensive things. I just don't because I don't care. The unexpectedness but you fall down. Okay, so far this seems to all work. Okay, but this doesn't work because our camera is from behind. So there's a hole and you will react to that and you will try to jump out of the way. That's my worry here that people will like accidentally kill themselves because they are trying to avoid the pit. Maybe first of all you add a gap that you think you can jump over but cutscene plays and makes everyone fall into the pit. That's even more BS. What the dude that's the old win the game but lose in the cutscene trick. We can't do that. I hate when games do that. That's why they have this fucked up part of the track where you can't jump anymore to indicate that's a cutscene to prevent you from messing up. Yeah I don't like that. Hello David. I'm going to save money to buy more protein and iron. I mean iron is definitely an investment that pays for itself. Just compare going to the gym to just owning home equipment. It is much cheaper. That is just facts. So the next thing is going to be a star. This is going to be a star Lilo. The rails collapse so you can't see it coming. But the shy guys collapse before you. Right the shy guys and you have to fall in together. What the hell. Oh the door is the wrong way around. Wait but once even you can send a player jumps to avoid the hole they fall into anyway so who cares. The minecarts are like going like this right and you are Mario and you're jumping on the minecarts. I'm worried that the player will jump off the minecart onto the track which is supposed to kill you because we don't want the player to just walk down the track. Yeah just merge the tracks at the end. Hey. I'm not sure I understand what if the lassie to watch them or something. Nay. They can't be stronger than Mario and do that. Is it really that bad if we don't have the cave collapse segment? Doesn't seem like that big a deal to me. What if we just go to the end normally and then when Mario lands and collapses that would be my suggestion if we wanted it to collapse like for sure. We'll have to make it somehow look collapsible. But that would be the one way I can see this work. Okay this is a little small for the Shy Guy table. But honestly not too small actually. Like we're almost there. Size-wise. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I'm thinking something like this will be the start area and then there's the three minecarts here that they hop into. And we'll have three of them and you can like swap between the three of them. And I think that's enough to make a decent platforming so just this platforming section. The question is how do we make the bullets look fine when they move slow enough that you can dodge them I guess. Maybe we should have the snuffits puff up. Like grow big. And then shoot just so the player has time to react. We should do this. Okay. That is funny. I don't want the player to control the sound per sound effect though. That'd be crazy. Okay. That's getting too close to the Sonic game everything is a slider territory. I feel like there should be a limit to customization. Cork bazooka. Okay, that is a funny idea. But I was thinking there would be snuffits and just shoot big iron balls at you. Oh, nice memory gene. That's good to know. Yeah, I think we're going to have them puff up and just shoot a big iron ball. Zelda, I have no idea what the fuck you're on about. What's this? How tall am I? I'm just six foot. I just had a tiny bit. Okay. I heard about PowerWorld. I actually played PowerWorld yesterday. I support anyone who gives Game Freak a bad time. I feel like Game Freak stopped trying like 50 years ago and them having at least a little bit of competition. Even if it's not good competition like PowerWorld is a good thing. PowerWorld supports human trafficking. What? Where did this come from? What the fuck? What does it mean for a game to support it? Like do they have like do they work at the same company that like a human traffic company works? Like are they paying to traffic people and programmers like into their company or something? Because if not, then I'm not sure what it means for them to support human trafficking. You can actually sell people in the game for a lot of money. Okay, but that's not supporting human trafficking. That's like saying GTA supports murder. So you can keep selling metal do not care about the competition. Yeah. There is no serious competition to it yet. That is true. Okay. I think the tragic part about Pokemon is that yeah, everything is just so low effort. So unoptimized and they get away with it. I'm also one of those people that cares a lot about the animations because I feel like that's what gives the creatures personality. So if you make a Pokemon game without the good animations, it's kind of taking the fun out of it. I feel like they used to know that which is why Pokemon Stadium is really good. Hello, a person. Hello, a person. Hello, a person. Pokemon Stadium. Pokemon Stadium looks sick. That's not mainline. Well, Pokemon Colosseum then, which I guess is also not mainline, which also wasn't made by Game Freak, which I guess helped the game a lot. Tragically. Pokemon XT is the Edge.Emo game. I was not aware of this. Well, they used the Pokemon Stadium animations in Pokemon Colosseum. So that's what they do there, except for like the new Pokemon that they added there. They have like new animations. They also use the stadium models, which that's kind of a cool thing you can do. If you have once made good 3D models for Pokemon, you can use them over and over. So it is a thing that pays for itself in the long run. Looks like an edgy game. I played it and I didn't think it was very edgy. I think it's fair to say, though, that Paloalto is like the edgy Pokemon. They never keep shit up to date yet. More and more Dragon Dino, but the mods aren't there yet. Maybe, yeah. Does it run at 50 FPS? Paloalto is a PC game, so they can just be like, hey, if this doesn't run well, you just need to upgrade your PC. Love when companies do that. You were making a joke? Lila, the last time Pal was 50Hz, you weren't even born yet. Hey. It's funny because it's true. Wow, Boomer. I didn't grow up on 50 FPS either. All right, this seems like a good size. As soon as you'd be here, you'd see like a cutscene of the guys being there. Like oh shit they found us and then they're gonna run this way and then there'd be the minecarts here. Is this a good enough size for the minecarts? I'm not sure. Maybe one more segment. So all that's really impressive you're still alive. Am I that old? The cave is very small yeah yeah maybe maybe just a tiny bit more dude I can't see I want to see Is your soul energy going to have a child to raise this year? Leela you could have a child to raise too. The hell you mean? Leela when I'm 90 you're gonna be 80 we're gonna be old together. What do you mean you couldn't actually? Let's do this Charles and Sonic we're so cool I love that part. You know what are you that far along already? I have no idea. Maybe you don't know you don't even know you don't even know and I am supposed to Hello Oomphie. Hello Mario64Rice. Hello Benyakan. I am LightYagami. False. Dude I feel like had I been LightYagami I never would have been caught. He just had What's your one Pokemon if you had to choose to be one? Mewtwo? What a question. You want to be Ditto? I feel like that's the worst Pokemon to be. Do you know what they do with Yeah honestly Weedkid fits to Leela. Ditto can turn into Arceus and Obliterate you? No one needs to see an Arceus first. You're not gonna see any other Pokemon you're just gonna be a Ditto forever you can just turn into people. Hello SuperBobbyJoe. SimpleFlips sent you. What a nice guy. Yeah he's been super dedicated to his weight loss thing. He's doing a pretty good job with it. There we go. We remapped it. Squirtle literally sucks. Okay why don't you just pick Mew then Zelda? Mew can also transform and you have all the power of Mew. Yeah when you are an online creator like SimpleFlips or me you kind of are also gonna be a role model for a lot of people so there is additional responsibility on you to live your life in a good way. Which is a little depressing because I want to be a little gremlin but I can't. I'm your role model. Do you want to be a big strong man like me one day? Of course Mew can transform. Mew can learn every move ever. Are you not up to date on Pokemon lore? No thanks. I want to be as old as you one day. Don't worry you'll get there. I hope all of you turn old. All of you. You're so mean to me. You guys remember that guy? The guy that was like Honestly I think it is entirely reasonable that during the lifetime of most of the people in chat right now we will figure out eternal life. I believe. It doesn't even seem that difficult. Okay Zelda what the fuck. That is so random. Cryogenics. Yeah I'm not sure about that one. Maybe turn your request into a toddler now. We're gonna figure it out but I can't afford it. Yeah that will be the issue. It's gonna be artificially so expensive. So I feel like your dreams are already possible. Like I feel like you can already be those things. You don't need to become a Pokemon for that. Do you think eternal life is scary? Imagine just seeing everything around you change constantly to the point where you can't relate to anyone. I can already not relate to anyone. I'm a weird dude. I think the scary idea about... I actually think non-eternal life is scarier than eternal life. Because if you have eternal life then everything you do like it automatically has meaning because you're gonna be around forever. But if you're gonna die none of it is gonna matter anymore. It's like you're gonna die and then you're gonna die and then you're gonna die again. That's how I see it. Oh what the f**k? A bit selfish in it. No definitely non-aging. Existential crisis my beloved. Dude I love getting existential crisis from my Mario 64 modding stream. That's what I'm coming here for. Is this your first ROM hack? No. Are you talking about eternal life games will probably all be extinct? If you think so. You'll believe in extinction in that short of a time. So I mean even if it does get that bad I feel like at most like maybe like 80-70% of humanity would die if it actually is that bad. But like not everyone's gonna be dead. I think that's a bit too pessimistic. A pyrophobia is the phobia of infinity or eternity causing discomfort and sometimes panic attacks. So you just see like a non-converging series and panic. Let's move on to something else. All right I guess I see how this could be very depressing. I think eternal life is possible though so I'm very optimistic here. I think it will be happening. Where's the ship going? The ship? Oh the ghost ship. I was working on it upstream. Dude how do you even get to the ghost ship? France is like the most hated nationality. What did the French do? I believe forever but keep aging. No that would be the worst. We are superior and they hate us for it. That's what the Germans used to say. Didn't turn out good for them. So the white beard and two white hairs on his head about to press the release button on romhacking.com. Come on. I have always been timely with my releases. Just because a youngin like Lila couldn't appreciate the time frame because this is such a big time frame that is beyond this youngin's comprehension. Doesn't mean it's taking too long. You're also really old. Okay. Canadians are so friendly. It's actually crazy. How do I smoothly turn this into a minecart track? I don't want to have the issue that I have to UV map the entire cave like this. That would suck. I also think these textures are just not good. Yeah, I live in Canada. I've been living in Canada for like three years almost two years something like that. Hello overlord. Old lord actually. I do not eat maple syrup now. All life will eventually end with the heat. We don't know that. Okay. This remake is called Return to Yoshi's Island. 64. Germans are extremely unfriendly compared to Canadians. That is a fact. Okay, this cave size feels a little more comfortable. Don't like the textures yet. Okay, this is good. I think the size is right now and the shape works too. Super Mario 65. I can't call it Super Mario 65 because people might think I'm skillenial and I am not ready to be cancelled yet. Mario 66. Okay, it's getting hotter. Mario 128. Okay, we're adding the number. Anyone bit more than 128? Can I hear 129? Mario 130. Mario 256. Mario 360. Okay, it's getting there. Yeah, true. Using Mario in the title after Mario officially died in 2021 kind of is misleading. 99 exclamation mark. That's a big number. Are you gonna sell the game? I am not gonna sell the game, it will be downloadable for free. Surely an interesting aesthetic, but not good at all. Yes, it will also be open source. Free and open source. I might sell a version of the game that is just the OST. So like just an OST cartridge and it's gonna come with a box and an instruction manual. So that's my idea for how to maybe monetize this. So you can't buy the game, but you can buy a souvenir about the game. I mentioned not a lot of people are gonna buy it, but I think it's just gonna be really cool to have that exist. Yes, everything will be open source. I can't open source the game without open sourcing the engine. This is just not a good texture. Nah. Yeah, I think it would be really cool to have like an instruction manual and everything. It's just too tiny. Yeah. Once you need a lawyer. Oh, are you gonna study law for me later? How nice of you. Or is it because you're already Dan's lawyer? I'll let you know there are several 12 year old lawyers I have on Twitter. There was one guy in specific that would always update me on what the current copyright law is. Surely knew his stuff and wasn't just making up shit as he went. He was kind of writing law fan fiction, if that makes sense. You know what we should do? I know an easier way to UV map this. We should have separate floor and wall textures. And that's gonna solve all our woes. And makes more sense anyway. Yeah. You saw the extra $5 a piece? Like the patch file? What? Did I work out today? What's your routine? Today is actually a rest day, but I have a push-pull-lax routine. Pretty simple. There will not be a bar cam. A hand cam? Theoretically, there could be a hand cam and I would not get banned for it. But there is not. Look.  Let's look into the rocks folder. Oh no, the fucking oven went on. Gets all the patch files? Yeah, but who's gonna buy the fucking patch files?     Well, actually, I guess a bunch of people would. But you could just distribute it for free as soon as one person bought it. And then I made $5 and everyone hates me. Yeah. I actually think video games should not be monetized off of video game sales. I think that's a stupid concept. Because you can make free copies of your video game. Like, it doesn't cost you anything. So you're kind of just like prisoners dilemmaing people into paying you. Which I think is stupid. I don't have a perfect solution to it. I think maybe you should sell souvenirs of your video games. Right? Or like plushies. Stuff like that. Just merch. I think that is my ideal world here.  That's how people sell OnlyFans photos? Actually, true. People do sell OnlyFans photos. How the fuck does that work? You do know you can just open Google and type Big Booba. And you'll find the same content, right? That's a stupid case take. Now I kind of get what persons mean when they don't trust you. People don't trust me? What are you on about? I don't know. No, I'm not telling you to do that. I'm saying you could do that. I'm telling you not to buy OnlyFans. Because it's stupid. Because you can literally just... It's a sexual parasocial issue. Yeah, I know. That's the fucked up part. Bad influence? No. Okay, for the record. Just so everyone knows. I think you shouldn't be looking at porn at all if you can avoid it. I think that's a pretty bad habit or addiction to have. And it kind of rots your brain. I think everyone's better off not looking at porn. There you go. Isn't that the take you wanted to hear? I completely avoid it in my life, actually. Yes, I'm using multi textures. Okay. A lot of these are ripped from random games. And some of them are made by artists. You know, porn addiction and stranded do not exist? In what sense do they not exist? As in you can't be physically dependent on them? Or you can't be psychologically dependent on them? Because I'm pretty sure psychological addiction to that exists. I used to know a bunch of weed smokers that would also tell me you can't be physically addicted to weed. But they were all psychologically addicted to it. They couldn't stop. It's unrecognized as a thing. I can't have it in my DADA. I don't consider that very convincing evidence. Maybe I'm being the paranoid one here. But big organizations are very corrupt. If you had asked a big organization in the 1960s if cigarettes are dangerous, a lot of them would have said no as well. Right? I like to use that as an example. Or if you had asked them about whether oil is bad. I don't like listening to authority figures on any issue that is politicized like that.  It's like I'm born time to smoke weed or watch porn so it's kind of like League of Legends that's what you're saying. Most of the people said yes but Regisviewer consumed a regular amount and shamed themselves into thinking it was bad. I guess to be able to recognize that you have an addiction you need to have tried to quit it first. So I guess if you never tried to quit it you would not ever think you were addicted right? So unless you thought you had a reason to quit you wouldn't think you're addicted. You need to filter for people that think it's bad for you and then ask them if you think they're addicted. I think that's like the only way to do it and then maybe filter out people that would do it for moral reasons. That's like the group you want to look at in my opinion. Do you think retina porn users are shits? What a fucking question. I always thought those websites are for people that just don't have enough to do in their lives and you probably shouldn't use them ever. It's not even bad in the first place. I think it can reduce the grey matter in your brain. That's what I read. I don't know if that's true. Like it affects short term memory and some logical progress of your brain. Man the floor looks nice but the walls don't. I guess the floor just has nicer contrast and depth to it. We should try to do something similar for the walls or this is going to look weird. That sounds like a Christian lie like jerking off makes you deaf. It could be. Again it's one of those topics that are heavily politicized so there is going to be a lot of misinformation and propaganda about it regardless of which side you're on. Stream for a mod about Mario 64. True. But why not have interesting conversations while we're modding Mario 64 and I'm looking for my textures. I'm so sorry Mario Sunshine. I see why. Honestly I don't think it makes a big difference. It just doesn't really have a space in my life. That's funny so much. I guess your dad spoke from experience. How have I avoided the punchline danger? I haven't. I had 70 of my videos taken down. Of course so. That's what I do all the time. Yeah over 70 actually. Usually when a video gets too popular they just take it down. My channel would be a lot more blown up if it wasn't for Nintendo trying to sabotage me. But it is what it is. Okay Rock 1-1 is the good one but I think it needs more contrast and then this might work. Why do they take it down if it's too popular? Because they don't like competition. Mario Sunshine do you keep switching between Twitch and YouTube? Is this two different people? What's going on? What is blood doing? I don't watch speedruns anymore I much prefer like tool-assisted speedruns Oh, that's a bit high contrast That's too dark and smudgy Although with the other textures swapped it might work Oh, I see That's... I didn't even think about that Yeah, maybe you can't see it there I'm an AI supremacist? What is that? It's the first time I've heard of those people Taz is not AI? Oh, that Taz is AI AI supremacist is something like an alpha male who thinks that AI is the new sigma No! Whatever you just said, that makes no sense 74 is a very early hack and of course it's kind of cheaply made But I think if you play it with the non-stop cheat code it's kind of fun Silver, do not worry, I know what I'm doing Just hang tight, I'm gonna make something good I don't like how fucking Nintendo Hiatus Man Ultra HD this floor looks Like I feel it's too high resolution, it's just jarring It looks like an HD texture pack Yeah, I always try to be as objective as possible generally A lot of people told me I was too harsh on my own hacks, but I think I was mostly very fair with that Alpha male is less than AI male is less than Skibri male Why does the yogurt male rank in this one? The wall texture on the floor, it would look good on the floor too, I'm pretty sure You don't know if yogurt males are even better than alpha males Yogurt males between astrology male and pickle jar male, oh okay Yeah, I can kind of see it, definitely above astrology male Can I send this on OST? Sure Well, this is what Nintendo does, Silver Alright, let me pick one of these songs We'll listen to this one Zelda Song Request I already knew it's normal to look back at me like this was complete horse shit Well, a lot of the old stuff I didn't even think it was good while I was making it I was just making it because I wanted to I think speedrunning in early childhood actually has benefits, but if you are older, probably not. Like it can increase your dexterity and stuff like that. It can get you some important life skills like how to practice stuff. But past the age of like 25 I think it's just a waste of your lifetime and there could be better things you're doing. I don't think anyone's getting happy by speedrunning. Yeah, this floor looks a lot better. But this is coming from the perspective of someone who does things because they will be beneficial in the future all the time. If you just do it for fun, of course, it's a different story. So I quit watching. No, I quit watching because I just lost interest. I know how easy it is to cheat a speedrun. So for me just seeing a good speedrun, it's like, yeah, I know there's a good chance this is not real. It kind of takes away from the enjoyment of it for me. When it's to improve your dexterity? Yeah, but the benefit is lesser when you're that old. No, I would never just claim that any specific speedrunner is cheating. I'm just saying I know it's easy. And there were actually some Mario 64 waterkirts that did turn out to be cheated in hindsight. So it's not even new to the Mario 64 community. But I'm not never want to just insinuate anyone specifically as cheating. Do I miss MatPat? I have not watched a MatPat video except as like a joke. Hello, Arthur. Everyone that speedruns faster than me is cheating. True. That's like the same mentality as lifting. Everyone who's stronger than me is taking steroids. It's strange that the wall on the floor looks so different. That is true. Maybe I can use this texture here. I don't think that looks too bad. We're going to have a transition here, obviously. So it's not going to look as weird as you think right now. Maybe I should just do this once so we can all see it and agree that it looks good. God, this level has a shit ton of materials. I mean, making a cheat run is easy, but I think most waterkirts are stream enough that it isn't likely in practice. Maybe. Although I feel like even with handcam it's going to be very difficult to follow the movements. I know that there was one very popular speedrunner in Mario 64, Sixteenstar, that did cheat and then admitted to it a bit later. So I guess that's also kind of where I'm coming from here. Even without the cheating, it just wouldn't be very interesting to me anymore. Why don't you watch MatPat? Why would I watch MatPat? Isn't it just like shitpost theories he makes? Like fucking Mario is a communist, Mario is a psychopath, Mario the man versus Mario the idea. That's what I hear about MatPat. And doesn't he have like 25 Nights at Freddy's videos? No, I'm using $5 Walmart earbuds. I think the transition would look fine if the UVs matched up. More like 93, holy shit. Definitely needs vertex colors, but after that. Oh, so he does make serious projects as well that I would find interesting after. I mean, if all you knew about me was Fidget Spinner 64, then I think that would be a fair criticism. Yes, I do, but like my point is I don't care about Five Nights at Freddy's, so I'm not gonna watch that. Fall into the cowboy level cave, just like this video. What is this? A sub! Thank you for the sub, Gangnam Life. I, okay, I'm not watching a 50-minute video. I think I don't like the floor texture. I don't think it's good. I think it's too tiled. Okay, let's end this. Back to the cowboy stuff. We only talk about funny senselessness because it's the funny ones. I don't even find interesting, but I think some of them are well thought out. Okay, but yeah, I mean, if it's just games I don't know, then I have no reason to watch it. Seriously, it's like how realistically powerful a bullet bill would be. That's your example of a good video. Wow, Arthur Tilly, how nice of you. No Yoshi of the week, but Koopa bullying this time. Oh, I feel like I've seen this. It's actually three people you're bullying. They're all trapped in eternity. Actually, MatPat did play Last Impact, so I should like him for that, but he didn't link back to my release trailer. He didn't tell anyone who made the game. I feel like I have to hate him for that. I don't think he meant anything malicious by it though. I think he just didn't think about it. Dude, PewDiePie did that with Chaos and people came to my video and were like, dude, PewDiePie made them stop stealing his stuff. Some serious fucking lore. Dude, I feel like it's gonna come naturally just like in Mario 64 because they didn't put fucking lore in Mario 64. There was like 30 years worth of lore just came out of it, out of nowhere, out of thin air. Dude, how is every time I try it, it's just ass. That sounds good, Biobak. I would like that, actually. Yeah, exactly, Spacewalker. See, as long as it doesn't hurt the popularity of the game, I don't mind people doing that, right? Because they didn't damage me, like, why would I care? It's just a little bit silly. You like the last one? Nah, it wasn't tiling. I don't know if I like a cobblestone thing. I mean, we can look at the cobblestone folder too. We have tons of these. This just looks like stone, which, fair, it's cobblestone. A lot of these look very man-made. There's also this, which is, it's way too contrasty. Why is it so hard to find a good cave texture? Dude, this is what I had in Course 3 at the beginning, and I hated it. And to hear him say, this is a story about grief, about pain, about trying to survive. This is the story of All Alone Bubble Dome. That would go hard. Can you use ChenCPT to create a texture? We can try. Let's use ChenCPT. Make a 64x64 grayscale stone texture for my cave in 64 game for me. Let's see what it's coming up with. This texture actually seems kind of good as like a detailed texture. I kind of dig this texture, honestly. If I just have something with a little bit of contrast, I feel like it could work. This is too directional. All right, let's see. Oh, awesome. That's an awesome 64x64 texture. M.A.I. That's the bad thing. You can't use that case. Only bad people do. So yeah, I mean, I 100% figured it would do one of those blend the texture showcases. I'm not surprised by that at all. Like, of course it would. I just didn't because someone wrote a comment for me to do that. There's an AI texture generator. I might look at that later, but I'm not hopeful for this one. He didn't specify in 64 texture. I did specify in 64 texture. This is for the thing, Chris 12. The thing in the sky, you know the name. I mean, coloring it when it's basically done. Not right now. Vertex coloring it right now would be such a huge waste of time. So. You've seen me in Robotronics comments. Yeah, I sometimes comment on the stuff. He showcases his stuff in Discord. So whenever he shows something, I usually take notice. Fix the UV? No. So. I started modeling last, vertex coloring first, then textures, then model. True. I totally believe you. So. True. After robots, bad Apple blew up. Dude, the fame just won't stop. So. Okay, we just need the first curve here so that the shy guys can wait for Mario there. So. So. So. I think this works. The submarine noises are back. Yep, that's winter. The ring sign, you see, I unfortunately do not get that reference. So. Yeah, I have a heater in the room next to me and it's so fucking loud. We're gonna switch for electric heat hopefully soon. It's an old house we live in. Did I just read sex level? I don't think so. I don't think you read that. I think you just imagined that being there. So. Dude, it was so funny seeing King Toad do the spider boss in Last Impact, and it was so fucking easy when he did it on stream. That was one of my favorite winter speedrun marathon moments. It's because in 1.2 the spider boss is laughably easy. Just in 1.0 and 1.1 it's kind of difficult. Okay, so now it is time to make the minecart rails. So. Do we use the same rails that we used here? Do we like these? Actually, I feel like they render wrong. Let's fix the rendering on these first. Let me take a look at them. Yeah, look at that. It renders wrong. That's annoying. It sucks a little bit that we're limited by what renders fine on Glideon. How is this causing rendering issues? I'm using Nemuel. Would it be better if the cave more brown than just gray? Yes, it's not colored yet. Actually, I don't know what the color is going to be yet, but it's not just going to stay gray. What's crashing? This sucks. Yeah, something in Astella is not working on Nemi right now. I guess it would also crash on N64. That sucks a lot, because now we can't look at this. But I think it is rendering fine. It's just a Gliden bug. So maybe we shouldn't address this. Maybe we can change the texture filtering to fix this. What if I use average? I should get a faster PC just for exporting from Fast64. It's even worse! Does this issue appear on point filter? Was the block of ice that bad on Monstrous Manor? I guess it was a little annoying. For me, what ruined Monstrous Manor for me was the toy town. I didn't like that at all. It ruined the Manor feeling. I liked that a lot until then and after that it kind of turned into a bit of a slug. Even average does this. Even point filter does that. How does this work anyway? Oh, there's another one. I see. Yeah, I only remember one of them. You never uploaded the finale? I never played the finale. I kind of stopped caring and then I just didn't play the game anymore. Does this fix the render issue? My top 30 anime? What is with these insane questions? Yeah, it sounds like the text is wrong, I think. Hey, it works! Do you like these Minecart tracks? Should we use them? What do you think? I don't know. My new smart TV? I don't have a smart TV. I think they're good. That is not a Minecart? This is a Minecart track. Actually, no, this is a train track. Maybe the Minecart shouldn't have the same track as the train. Oh, my CRT. That's the saloon. It's a milk saloon. But I like that you can tell from the design that it is. Okay, fair. It's hard to not tell that this is a milk factory. But it is still good that you can tell. If you weren't able to tell, then I would have done it wrong. Can you walk on the rails? It's because Fast64 doesn't apply the modifiers when you export. Add Leela. Now a few people have commented that the squash and stretch is too much. There's a good chance it will be turned down still. Yep, this is the cowboy level. I don't usually like Fast64, but it wasn't a bad game.    I don't usually like Fast64, but it wasn't a bad game. I don't usually like Fast64, but it wasn't a bad game. I don't usually like Fast64, but it wasn't a bad game. Which sucks balls. Okay, this feels like it's way too many triangles. It's definitely, oh god, oh god. Nope, we can't do that. The OST is over. Dark Wild West music. Two-step cursor, like, exactly the same theming and color of BC. Does the cowboy level in BCTM look anything like this? Because I didn't know he had one, and then I started working on this, and someone told me, okay, so you need to look at BCTM's one, and then I saw it for the first time. Your funny dialogue idea? Shit, did I miss it? Remember how I said one NPC should mention Conspiracy Theory, and yeah, yeah, what about it? That's so mean, SnakeGoose, why would you say that to me? There's another message right after. You should say something like, I don't like that fella always talking about bounties. We do things the murky way. Okay, that's a crazy pun. How are we gonna have the goon bounty line in the game? Where would that dialogue be? I feel like a dialogue like that needs to be an easter egg, you know? There are some locate... I'm pretty sure that's from Too Many Coalition Triangles, because we didn't make the Coalition map yet. There are some locations here that are pretty hard to reach, like on top of here. If we had a dialogue like that on top of the hat, I think that would be fun. That would be very cool, just as an easter egg. Yeah, don't worry, whenever something crashes here, it's gonna be very easy to find the crash, because we have a debugger that tells us the exact address. See, Mario teleported into fucking nowhere. That's definitely from the Coalition Triangles. We just have Too Many right now. What's the uranium block doing there? That's gonna be a cactus. We just need to actually have the cactus to import it. It's not Pete to the area. Looks like the SML hand in Cap Kingdom. It's custom made, I'm pretty sure. Where were you thinking for that message to go, Biomech? Because I feel like that's such an out-of-pocket message, that having this be in the main area is just gonna be so confusing. Yeah, these seem like a good size for this. The UV map is a bit messy at times, but that's to be expected while we work on this. On the top hat is funny, okay. Any NPC wishes for what that should be? I feel like up here is cool, because then you can technically see them from the train tracks if you get there somehow, which is a good hint. My engine requires WASP. Yeah, this one uses 4 extra megabytes, but that's nothing to do with my engine. It's just easier to work with that much. Actually, I don't know if this game is possible in less than 4 megabytes. But I never tried to get less than 8 megabytes in this. Do you know any third language? I know a little bit of Latin. What's the exact text you're thinking here? Yeah, milk is non-alcoholic. They also have chalky milk. That's like the alcoholic version. Now, when we make keystrokes like that in Luigi, we want them to actually be something. Not just a character telling you that you can't be here. The extra 4 megabytes lets you do memory segmenting a little bit, which is like a 3-5% speedup. So it does make the game a bit faster, but that's not significant compared to all the other shit. Now, you teach a second language in third-year cream team. Do I have the bounty idea here anywhere? No, I don't remember the first part of this text Biobak. I don't remember which shiny he had. He saw the bounty bot and he ran away. I don't know what this guy deals with bounties. We do things the milky way here. All right. If you guys are confused about what the bounty conspiracy theory is, basically, you guys know the bounty chocolate bars with coconut? No one actually likes or buys them. They are not real chocolate bars. In reality, these are being manufactured by the drug syndicate. They're using drug money to buy up the bounties in the shelves to convert it into normal income. This is a money laundering scheme. No one actually likes bounties. This is real. I made this up and it's true now. Might get me banned, but I like bounties. See, Biobak is part of the syndicate. He would know. I think a lot of people kind of come up with that theory. It's not a theory. It's true It's a true story I made up I Think this is enough minecrafting. I don't think it needs to be any longer than that That sounds more insane than the optimizations Only someone who eats bounty would say something like that But that's not a theory it's a factoid a game factoid I Feel like this is so many triangles I'm any sister on segment 42. So this is 420 right now. I Don't think we can have this be any longer if you want it to be like this. Oh Actually, we can subdivide a lot of it we can unsubdivide a lot of it actually so it should be fine I Need my lawyer to answer this one Lila didn't you want to be my lawyer? They were asking why my photos called sm65 Even if she was here all the time. What is the issue with that? Let people enjoy the things they like Especially if it's my stream It doesn't matter how much we subdivide the spline that's not gonna add anything to the geo So that's why it's a subdivided. It gives us a bit more control I Lila is a little gremlin It is common knowledge Oh Shit you don't have mud on twitch Guess after is free to make great jokes then Bummer I I How do I mod someone's smash Martin biomech does that work Maybe that works Did I just type that in both shots I Don't feel bad claiming what happened I Can't actually see what's happening on Twitch because I'm on restream So whatever's happening on there, that's not like directly in chat. I wouldn't see it It didn't work. Oh Unlucky It is what it is All right, and here's your cinematic scene where it all goes down I Feel like this is gonna be very difficult to make look any good at all I Was gonna take what Rover said and check what did he say? I Especially think I'm gonna meant this is what he wants Creates a sense of media That much is definitely true So it's gonna be like a spot here and then you fall down there And then down here, I guess there's a fight or something I actually haven't decided on that part Robot throwing matching them typical robot, right? We all know Rover this stuff did the shade thrower I Have to look at this now Does this guy kind of look like case I Fuck he kinda looks like me. No way. He actually looks like me. He looks like if I was fat What the fuck He actually looks exactly like me the fuck Oh How can this be 50 pound area I Did that guy's not gonna think that's rude look at them he went what the fuck there's a woman in my room He's gonna have a sense of humor I Thought you left you in so me my behavior It never had any in cell behavior. What am I being accused of? Female what's wrong with calling women female? Calling someone baby. No, it's definitely no, that's that's something else. That's also bad. I Don't know if I want to respond to hello, honey, I'm using Ubuntu I Press the Ubuntu button and then it compiles. Yeah. Okay. This is too many triangles maybe Yeah, I have no idea what I'm using I just hit the Ubuntu button and then I hit compile I Don't know which one I'm using. I know I'm using the faster one If WSL tooth is faster than that is what I'm using. I don't know which one I'm using. I know I'm using the faster one I See I See you idea Hmm That looks very cool But then we have the issue that you want to jump off again That's my problem with that this looks like you should jump off it's gonna interfere with gameplay This is what we're talking about by the way I Jump off out like off the rail and then like landing on here And I don't want the player to ever be on this rail. I want the player to just die if they go on this rail So we never want to give the player reason to me trying to get on that Right. So we have you have this and then right here There's like a platform to stand on and as soon as more stands on it like crumbles That would work Just make it so you can't exit the thing just like in the cave level But the idea is okay I thought the idea was there's three minecarts and you jump between the minecarts and you're never actually in the minecart You're just jumping between them Because I still want this to be Mario movement No, the minecart was just gonna crash into here and throw you off forwards I Mean you jump one minecart between three rails. No, I don't want that. I Just want three minecarts that you jump between I Have no idea what you mean by a collider you'll have to be more specific I Move condition on the tracks at the end so players can learn on them. So you just die when you jump off What problem does that solve So instead of landing on it and fading out you fall through it and die I Don't think so No, it doesn't Leela that's the entire issue Leela I It doesn't apply it for you Why aren't you here when I showcased that it doesn't apply to collision Leela Only visuals I thought I showed you the bug earlier. Okay Arthur calm down If there's nowhere to go they will stay on the rail Okay, but I don't want players to walk on the rail because otherwise they might just walk away from the shy guys Why is Mario falling through this the fuck Why is half of this non-solid The play wants to walk on the rail and let them walk on the rail no, I Don't know how much freedom should give players and it should end when they ruin their playthrough for themselves Your idea is forcing itself into existence why it should just not working So So Okay, there we go  Didn't you do a pokemon ish mod with mario? There's one mod I have where mario has a few pokemon. Yeah It was a commission mod So it wasn't my idea Um Wait, i'm who's ranting about mario 64 speedrunners, what are you on about? No one was ranting about mario 64 speedrunners ever in this channel So No, I think it's a decent mod i'm just saying not everything and it was my idea Okay, now it works I guess it didn't work because of the Things just not being within bounds So They fall through the rails and then something between that should work This is a chase mission. You are chasing people if you don't Catch up to them. You're gonna die We don't people to just do what i'm doing here right now because that is such boring gameplay I'm gonna make it so that if you land on the rails, you're just gonna die That's literally it there's no argument about this And then at the end there will be like a platform to stand on here And the shy guys will be there and then as soon as you land on it We'll still be like around this height It all falls down because Biobak one starts. I'm not sure why And then you're here and I guess this is a boss fight I think making a pokemon romhack on pokemon stadium 1 or 2 With like a proper overworld a proper pokemon game That would be cool as fuck So they just die what will that solve well, they were already gonna die No, no, no, we were gonna make it. So if they land on the rails, they fade out and die And then you suggested okay. What if you just make them fall through the rails and die? Which doesn't solve anything. It's the same thing. It just looks worse I It's just an image I stole of google images jacks like 11 years ago Are you satisfied with the commercial? Absolutely. I think it's a pretty cool game Just some things I would have done differently like I think it's not entirely consistent in what the design goal is in the game So No, it's like when you land on the rails the shy guys get away and that's why you fade out That's my idea here So Should the rails be less vertically flat? No, we need the player to platform on them and like dodge stuff Maybe they did I mean They took some stuff from the missing link actually for tears of the kingdom if you think about it the hourglass They had status although they probably put status in before They had ever heard of the missing link because the missing link came out like in 2019 and I think they started development in like 2017 Still it is funny to say that they store So Hello yannick I'm like 90 people struggle a lot with your idea You think it's too difficult To see you  Jumping between minecrafts I can see how that would be very difficult. Yeah, we do have inertia but in the curves it's gonna be very difficult I Think you have to stop bullying her. She's working on fast 64. You cannot bully someone while they're working on fast 64 That's like the immunity zone When I beat her with the penis gun, yeah, I Don't know I didn't see any of that No, I see what you mean by a back Maybe it would be better to just have you be able to jump between rails. What would the controls be? And automatically moves forward and you can press a to jump or something a and the direction to jump How would we this needs to be intuitive, right? Yeah, we have proper momentum get boards but it's still difficult to like in curse here how are you gonna do that You just have multiple cards to jump between that was the original idea. Yes Orange and the problem with multiple cards to jump between is that like in these curves here? It's gonna be really difficult for players to jump to another minecart Yeah, they are right next to each other Maybe we should just try it And then if it doesn't work we can still do the other thing with just a minecart you're in and have it be a generic minecart section And see why that would be hard I can definitely see how this would be hard Like right here when you jump and the thing like rotates around the corner That is difficult to do Second question is the programming side of this We do have walls in the original minecart section that I think only minecarts can interact with The obstacle is the snippet cowboys that shoot at you Yeah Yeah, that would be out the alternative idea frostbite I Think I still have from manager somewhere. Yeah, it's not like it takes up much space on my hard drives I Hope the fuck does this section work Huh How does the minecart not fall off the rails here Raven is the minecart I Know as you can just plan them out to not require too many hard jobs when going around corners. Yeah Oh nicely, that's good Where is it turning The Wall angle. Oh I know what it is Okay, I'll tell you how this works There's a dynamic object that is only solid while you are in the minecart. And if you're in the minecart The object is like a wall that the minecart drives along around the curves And That's how this works. Okay That makes sense and that's easy to do for these we can It's gonna be difficult to make work Because the minecart if Mario is still moving around the noise gonna bump into the walls and So maybe we need to make splines to follow along we can make just free splines here All right, bye I'm back I'm curious to hear that Okay, you're asking a world question without changing anything in the world That means the fact that I'm not doing it right now is proof that I would not Mario Kart 64 I Think that's just a random idea you have make the heck yourself if you want that to exist Yeah, I guess we have to do it via splines that's not too bad The shy guys hop in a lead car it's attached to three minecarts on each rail with rope So you have more room to platform the minecarts you're on are full of TNT and the shy guys can deliver us a free minecart Oops, so you have to move out of the way Okay, once two, okay, so 16 minecarts in total And They're full of TNT and the shy guys can do it enough to free minecart grip So you have to move out of the way. Okay, so your idea is to make it free minecarts So it's easier to hit the minecarts. Oh Okay, so they have one minecart at the front and then nine minecarts, okay, okay Hmm Why TNT though keep in mind we can also just make these snuff it's the guys with the cannon head And then they could just shoot back at you, which I feel like it's more in character. I Like the idea of using multiple minecarts don't two or three sounds good. Oh Or What if it's just one big minecart Most of all the problem making them visible though Well, we can't have them just blow up and then shoot the big ball. That also is pretty easily done My worry is just that Mario might have problem just jumping between the minecarts Yeah, this is not a long section it's like 20 seconds of gameplay The Final version is likely gonna have more than 165 stars just because we kept adding new ideas to it Maybe like 175. I don't know the right position of a minecart Not sure Undecided Now we're not just making random quick time events we have all this Mario platforming in the game Why would we not want to take advantage of that? So You come here and they run over there and then hop into minecarts and then I guess no minecarts fall from the ceiling There's like like 85 stars or something, I don't know I Still so difficult to think about Actually if we make the beginning slow enough Then this shouldn't be so bad But like the minecarts moving and then all this has inertia and the turns are relatively soft Plus you respawn at the door. There's also a thing we can do now. I think we should go with the free minecarts idea I think it's simple. We'll try that. I'm pretty sure it works now, actually We'll go with the free minecarts Long minecart. Yeah. Yeah, I know this is what you were thinking Well, this is the issue that this is weird, but yeah, I get the idea But no, I think we should try the free individual minecarts first and have this work on Mario platforming Yeah, I mean this has supports and the other one is also gonna have some kinds of supports maybe like beams going from wall to wall Yeah. All right. Well, we are gonna try the three by three minecart idea. So Two by three minecart idea. So six minecarts in total with one each having a snuffit and then we're gonna have free snuffits here But that is something we have to do another day because it is the end of the stream So I'll see you guys in the next stream, bye bye
