Hello? Hello? Hello at E? Hello? We're working on overworld part 5 today. We need baskets with fruits, we need fruit trees, we need Yoshi's. Oh my god, we're back again. You're confused using fast64? How so? How is it confusing? Taking forever to load. It's not working any time now. There we go. So we need fruit baskets. Let's just get some of model resource. Actually, can we just make one? What do baskets really look like? We probably want squarish ones. Oh, the ones from WeParty look so good. I will make something like that. Hello Benjamin? Hello? That should be a nice sized basket. Maybe a little smaller? I hope it's a little better than that. I'm not a fan of the rare games to be honest. Let's consider this a little bit of a test flight. Game in Zelda Indigo. Huh? Why isn't individual origin working? Oh, I see. There we go. What does fast64 have to do with tool player mechanics? How are you? How's the baby? I'm good and the baby is good too. I don't think I've ever spoken on Twitch, but I watch a lot of your YouTube videos. You make great stuff for the community. I'm glad you enjoy my stuff. We're getting lag issues in this tool. I wish we were able to use the proper fast64 renderer. I wish it was ready so we could use it. There's a lot of performance improvements. Yes, I have made that romhack. It's called Mario's Mansion. Hello, Rod Holiday. Yes, I'm making an entire romhack with like 200 stars. It's getting close to finished. You didn't know? You were watching my YouTube videos and didn't know I was working on this? It's gonna be a gigantic hack. You're gonna be in for a surprise. Should I play my own game? I have to test my game so much because obviously I have to make sure it works fine. It is very repetitive for me. How are you confused with fast64 if the issue is that you need to program multiply completely separate from fast64? ... ... This is the game we're working on. Oops, I'm on the wrong audio output. We got test data from the first 5 courses and course 8. So we did some testing. Course 10 and then course 11 again. Those two will be at 100%. Course 12 is going to need quite a few updates, but that's good. Course 13 is going to be rough to test. Course 14 too and course 15 as well. Actually, we're soon going to hit 100% beta test completion on this game, which is great. Then we just need to finish the overworld and some side levels. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Still looks horrendous. The vertical tiling is fine. Horizontal tiling is not. That's good. Okay, we can make this section work. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Holy, that looks bad. Oh my god. That is awful. PBR kind of YouTube video? No, I haven't made a video yet. It's honestly the lamest trick in the world. It's literally just, I put the PBR algorithm and then re-rendered every pixel of a texture and baked it into a thing, onto a 3D model. Really nothing special, but it works and that's kinda neat. What if you use caseleaf00 and then 3D model the outline of the thing? Let's try that. You can see it's almost a minute long. When I started moving it, I was at 1.10. Oh, okay. Yeah, then 12 seconds sounds pretty fast. But a video titled Raytraced Gold Coins at no cost in the N64 will make... Okay, but it costs a lot. It costs a lot. It's very fast. It costs like 15 milliseconds on the CPU, but it doesn't really matter because the CPU on the N64 doesn't matter, which is kind of nice. You know what I just realized? The guy that wanted the free face boss fight, he hasn't been here in a while. He said he'd buy like a thousand-something dollars of merch to pay for the thing. Why didn't he do it? Weird. I really thought he was gonna do it. What? Base texture card interpolation? What does that mean? Does it basically mean like this? I mean, I can do this, right? I'm pretty sure the game already does exactly what you're supposed to do. I think if we add like two or three more branches like this to this tree, it could look fine. What is that tree? It's supposed to be a fruit tree. I am working on making it look decent. Yeah, pretty sure we do that. We got a balding. That is unfortunately true. It does look a little bit bald. Can we make this look less bald? Okay, wait. Separate idea. Let's try this. Kinda? Maybe? What if instead of this we had a solid texture in the middle? Wait, I have a bad idea. I think I know how. How is that? Actually, fair point. That wouldn't make any sense. Well, I think it just perspective corrects triangles like that by subdividing. Yeah, they're still quads. Actually, no, it doesn't have to subdivide. That's a PlayStation thing. What the fuck am I saying? There's some kind of subdivision going on though. I just do not remember what it's for anymore. It's definitely not for quads, let's not even say it like that. Bum over tree? What do you mean? It no longer looks bald? Come on, we're saved. The tree is not bald anymore. Let's add a second branch. Oopie, it's going to look fine, trust. Hello Daily Delphox, this tree is crazy. Someone who appreciates my tree, thank you. Do you actually mean it? Because if it's bad, then I need to know. I am not. That is kind of cool. Why do you assume that a tree has a star? There's this coming from. I don't think the texture is the problem. Dude, that probably was at least one meeting between Nintendo executives about me. 15 angry Japanese men just be like, fuck this guy, fuck this guy, hit this guy. The leaf textures are bad, oh, I'm putting a tree, but we all know it's going to shamer from a big potato chip to a nice potato chip shape, I hope so, I feel like a hidden tree style 5 knock or kick would be awesome. This is why players don't get to be game designers, actually they do, all those mods, it sounds like a terrible idea to me, the leaves look off but the wood looks sick, it's difficult to make the leaves look good I find, not really sure what I can do, well actually, what if we connected the leaves to the bottom part and then had a second layer of leaves on top, let's try that, less of a toupee look, it already looks a lot better from below. Is this the secret to making trees? That's so much better, and it's less triangles, and it's going to make your game mapping easier. That tree looks Mexican, what? I think I found the secret sauce, it's this type of shape. Tree looks fascist, what? My tree is not a Nazi, bully the little German boy, will you? These just don't look like leaves to you, is it because of the texture? He's molding but hiding it with a hat, well he is, let's go with Fintextures. Looks like paper in such a flat and defined shape, well we are going to add different blobs but I see what you mean, that is indeed an issue. Okay, wait. What if? What if? That doesn't really help. Do the scallop strategy. That's so much overdraw. Oh but I see, you just make the tree and then put a ton of leaves on it. That honestly does look great. Yeah, okay I see. Let's do something you can run around on. It doesn't really matter whether you can run on it or not. Mario Sunshine trees, let's see. Wait, Mario Sunshine tree people? No, Mario Sunshine tree. This? No. We'll do the tree still. I don't see any tree that isn't a palm tree here unfortunately. But the scallops tree looked really good. Wait, what the fuck? Of course half my tree is missing now. Can I undo to a point where I get my tree back? I don't think so, that's nonsense. I have to fix up the tree, cool. That wasn't so bad. But something like these? Nah, that kind of looks awful. I don't like this at all. Did I just raise another shading cost? I think you would call it the shading cost. It's actually the memory stuff. Let's find some leaves in here and see if that works. It's an idea from the main entries of the game since some of them have the same vibe you want. I seriously doubt there's anything in Mario 64 that should be used as an art reference for anything. Hello, I'm your cat. Correct, Shadow Boy. I tried a DK Nuke and it doesn't quite look like the art reference we had. Okay, that doesn't work for some reason. That's fine, we can deal with the extra triangle. Okay, that's good. Honestly, I cannot tell that it looks nicer. But if you guys perceive it that way, that's good. I will blaze you. That doesn't look very nice from below. Don't you see your texture? Oh, nice. It's going to consume one third of the death time case, but it doesn't matter. They liked it to Petri. I can certainly see an argument for it. Okay. Like a bench for five. I'm bench 350 and actually right now my shoulder is fucked, so I don't bench anything. What size does it need to be? Whatever looks good. Wait, what? I don't think I understand that part. It's a lot more than most people bench, so I'm not sad with it. It looks kind of dumb, I'll be honest. I'm not so sure about this. Look at that video again. It looks kind of dumb here, too. But it's like an acceptable amount of dumb, I guess, because like this only have four quads. Mine are a lot more details. Very crunchy. Maybe I perceive it to be an issue because I made this and I know the flaws with it. Like if Biobank sent me something like this in a model, I wouldn't really complain. Let me get a vibe check in game. Maybe that's going to change how I feel about this. I don't think this adoption matters. These are leaves, right? They're going to have different shapes. Leafy branches look like pipe cleaners since they don't have smaller branches connecting them to the root branch. Smaller branches connecting them to the root branch. What does that mean? More branches with more leaves help a lot. Probably. Maybe the base branch just shouldn't have any and instead there should just be branches attached to this that have those. Let me try that idea. Let's first just make a bunch of branches and then add leaves to them and see if that looks any better. At least attached to a branch with smaller branches instead of a big blob of leaf. That's true. Let's try that again. I wish so much of my game dev time wasn't spent on 3D modeling. Do we need even more? There is no ETA. It's done when it's done. What would individual leaves really look good? Oh well. These weird spinning trees. They're kind of fun. You sent some nice leaves. Let's see what you sent. Hmm. Okay, they are nice. Can you make them tile? So that I can put as many as I want in a row? And can you make them grayscale? I think these could work. There has to be so much overdraw though, right? Send individual leaves to it. Yeah, but can you tile it? I don't want to put individual leaves down. I think they should have more gaps. The branches? What if I put little quads on that are like a full texture of a branch? Let me see how that would look. Those are immersed. I will list them all. By the way, at least arrange the texture. That's true, yes. Although I do think it looks like uncharacteristically low detail for what we do. And if we had more detail, then the gaps that are implied would be obvious that they're missing. I don't know. Do not have a texture of a full branch. I guess something like this with a stick in between. It's what I'm looking for. Kinda like that, but less of a full texture. Anyway, let's just see how this looks. Obviously, the texture itself is horrendous. If we went with this technique, it would be a different texture. But I'm not sold on the technique either. Where's the one with the individual leaves? That's kind of less awful. Did I make trees before? All my trees before suck too. Trees are one of the hardest things to make for me. Unless it's like a palm tree. Palm trees are easier. This seems to me like it has potential. What do you guys think? I mean, there is a 64 branch in each one. This one had some nice trees, I think. Wait, you don't get to see it in this gameplay maybe? Come on, jump on the tree. Does he never show the tree? Oh, it's right there! Am I not showing the tree? That tree there, I kinda like it. Tree cluster tiles. Do you think you could make a branch texture like this here? The one you sent me is pretty nice, and I think this might work. I'm actually thinking the branch method here might be our salvation. That's nice. If you could make one 64x64 or 32x64? Actually, probably 64x64x64 would be perfect. You hate trees too? Makes sense, you make N64 games. Honestly, is it even true that N64 trees have to be bad? Or is it just everyone that ever tried to make one bad at making trees? Or are we all just making excuses right now? We need to make a super tree building competition. Whoever can make the nicest looking tree wins. I wonder if Doreala ever made any trees. I wonder if Doreala ever made any trees. I wonder if Doreala ever made any trees. I wonder if Doreala ever made any trees. I wonder if Doreala ever made any trees. I wonder if Doreala ever made a tree. Will the price be? You get a tree delivered to your home, I don't know. Are fur joints still? Nobody will have a chance. Do not speak to bro about what it is to me. I am going to be mad with you. It's honestly crazy that people just let them get away with that, like no one cares that they make trees like that. Assuming me that tree gets to be put into the hack, true, they make a competition, the prize is you get to work for me for free. This is kind of what the trees I see on model restores look like too. I don't know. I don't know.  When I first beat Marcy on my PS2, there was a fine part, I just had some bugs. Wait what? Losers, you worked for me for free and you didn't even... I wish you worked for free. I think I paint you, I don't actually remember. Don't lie to me because I will look up whether that's true or not. This one's very nice. Do you think you could add a little branch here? Just something for the leaves to attach to? Because I think if we attach these to a branch, that's suddenly going to actually make it look like a real tree instead of this fake thing. Wait, people actually use Brodude's trees in their romhacks? Yikes. So glad I don't play low effort garbage, so I don't have to see that. Do we have a gate for Chris 6? Nope! You can just enter. Yep, I think we can happily say that these other two are no longer required now. That's wild. There must have been a time where I already stopped playing romhacks. Stopped playing romhacks I think in like 2014, 2015, or well, I didn't stop playing them, but like, I stopped playing every single one that ever came out. Because I remember during the early days, there were so few hacks that we'd just play everything that came out. Actually got fairly far in Star Revenge 1 back then, I think I had like 40 stars. Your vegetation pack is an early romhack without credits? I didn't know you made a vegetation asset pack either. I don't think the texture exports, oops. Credits are fucking mandatory on day one, but not me for making all the flops and plants. Dude, this used to piss me off too, when people used the codes I put out with credits. Not because I wanted people to desperately know that I made the code, but rather because I wanted people to know that the person making the hack was not capable of programming that shit themselves. I was like, we need to gatekeep the ranks of Assembly Hacker, we can't let everyone think everyone else is an Assembly Hacker. We worked too hard for this status to have this be applied to everyone else. Why am I fixing up this texture, there's no reason that we need to use this, oh well. We're going to use the innocent texture anyway. You wouldn't blame anyone? But when people use the Assembly code without credits, then it's implicitly saying that they know how to code that, and by pretending that a lot of people have the skill, it devalues the skill. Imagine if 50% of humanity believed that they could prove the Riemann Hypothesis, and then there's a guy out there who actually proves the Riemann Hypothesis, and then 50% of humanity is like, okay so what, everyone can do that? You know what I mean? Suddenly this really cool thing that person did looks like nothing. I mean Daniel Santos, the guy behind Athena Env, said that the PS2 game didn't have anything better than using Dynalink and things, and I think that it remembers. It uses MIPS, although it also uses MIPS, then surely it can emulate the N64 very well. No! I just want the person that played the game to get out of the game realizing that the person that made the game didn't actually program it. They don't even need to say Kaze made this, they just need to say I stole this code online. What the fuck? This has to be an emulator bug, right? What the fuck? Huh? Don't tell me we're out of RAM. I think we might be out of RAM. Oh, fuck. Already? Are we actually out of RAM? I'm sorry, but I think no one cares about this. We're not out of RAM. Is this Antectus? Alright, I'll take a look in a second. Okay? It does happen when I tilt the camera left. Okay? It does happen when I tilt the camera left. There seems to be something here that's crashing the game when looked at. What the fuck? Wasn't that? Wasn't the seagulls? What advantage do you hope to gain from that toilet duck? So it was one of these three. Poochie, safe block, sandworm. Let's see what was Poochie. It's the safe block. Why would the safe block do this to me? Wow, that looks bald as fuck. Holy, that looks bad. Okay, let's hopefully fix this by using Zayna's texture. Oh, that's nice. Okay. Do we need them to be so desaturated? Oh, they're already indexed. Cool. Okay. Oh no, they have a blue background, Zayna. Oops. Okay. Why does Ctrl-A not work half the time? It's very annoying. And I wish I was back on Photoshop. Okay. I think I can cut them like this. Why would you need the trees placed at the start of runtime when you can just place them in the map yourself? Can't we just place them in the map ourselves? What if you want two trees that look differently? Okay. I remember placing one such tree and you want them all to place. What's the OST? Yoshi's Woolly World. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Simpsons Espionage, it's true, actually. So I do like this, the stem is a little too red though. Okay. The heel is a little less orange. Like so. The saturation is significantly less. Like so. How do I lighten this up? Ctrl-I. Ctrl-I. Doesn't work. Ctrl-I. Ctrl-I. Am I stupid? What the fuck? How's that moving the whole thing? Nandu! I will never understand game. What is going on? I hate the hips so much. It should be darker. Yeah, we can still vertex color it. You can always make it darker, you can never make it brighter. I should learn how to use GIMP at some point. It's so frustrating to deal with when you barely understand what's going on. This tree has potential. Yeah, baby! Okay. Uses too many colors to fit into CI4? Uh, no. All I did was change the colors. How? How is it using too many colors? You guys all watched my stream, right? I didn't add any color to this. What's my 17th color? Let's index it to 16 colors. Now we have 16 colors. We have 16 colors. You've all seen me index it to 16 colors. Just double making sure. We've all seen me hit index 16 colors. Too many colors. Yeah. Really. Even though I indexed it to 16 colors. Is there a way to see what 16 colors it picked out of the 17 that apparently I have? I guess I have to index it. But we lose so much quality from that. Do I have to count the colors? Or see palette and image? Windows dialog palette. That's not what I want. I want to see the palette on my texture. This one? It says there are 16 colors! Why does it say I have more than 16 colors in Fast64? Idea. I have an idea. Okay. Let's see. Somewhere along the line it must have added a different color and it didn't count the background as a color even though it is. The alpha does count as one color evidently but that worked in the original image and then it suddenly didn't work anymore so it must have added an extra color somewhere. It doesn't count the transparency as a color in GIMP but it does count it as a color in Blender even though there is a color in the transparent pixels that it exports from GIMP. It doesn't count it as a color. So this is infuriating. So why does my save block crash? The save block suddenly no longer crashes. That is scary that we have a random crash like that that just disappeared. I would prefer it was not crashing. It kind of looks like an autumn tree to me like the tree that's about to lose the last little bit of leaves it has. I don't know something about the tree doesn't look right to me. What do you guys think about the tree? I guess it's not completely awful. Maybe the issue is that the leaves look so big and the tree looks normal sized. So maybe it would be better with smaller tree leaves. So yeah I think the tree needs smaller leaves. Add some leaves at the base of the leaf texture and it will help with the borders. Leaves at the base of the leaf texture. Oh you mean like editing the texture to have more leaves at the bottom too. I think the trick is denser leaves. I think the trick at this point is just changing the texture to one that has a lot more leaves on it and smaller leaves and it's more dense and it shows less wood. Yeah you want to do that Zayna? Do you think we can get like three or four times as many leaves on here? I think that would solve it. I'm going to literally just copy paste the tree for now but we're going to make it look different in the end. Yeah two more rented at 90 on each branch. Yeah wait let's try that real quick. So that does make it look a lot denser. So maybe this plus the texture is what we need. So it is definitely dangerous to the filament. This is very expensive to render tree. So so out of here we can roll like this. So yeah I do think they look a lot better when they're bigger. So this also will reduce the filament issue a little bit maybe. Because the geometry is further spaced apart. Philip Raid is going to be happy about this. So so maybe it can go into water like this right. So how about I want me to make things as at least like 10 into 20 points leave each or no. Yes that would be very expensive. Not like a cherry tree. Oh no we have made it more weeaboo. So so okay the safe block is broken again. So versus Sniffbrook the unfeeling. That's the song right now. This is still the Yoshi OST believe it or not. Okay the trees make this feel so cool. Oh I like this a lot. The trees make the level feel so much smaller. Do you notice that? Like it felt big before now the trees are here it feels small. So and you will be able to run around on the tree here. We can make a conditional current. Oh that's beautiful. Yeah the trees on the walls actually definitely has to be changed somehow. All right I am happy with this. You see we're still getting the detection whilst we were through. Big af fruit tree, one on the big island, one next to the bridge. We got that. We have Yoshi houses. Next we need Yoshis. But before we do that are we happy with the Yoshi houses really? Because I'm kind of not. And if we're gonna spam a design all over the islands we better make sure it's decent at least. I already don't have one in the first two overworlds which is kind of nice. You want to make some new ones? Okay if you could do that soon that would be great. Rocks in the lake. Okay we have some around the lake. Let's see. Sand castle, bring on that sponsor blue coin if you don't fall down. Maybe bonus stuff for grabbing a toy out of the lake? Maybe. We didn't really want that. That was with a question mark, a big question mark. The clouds behind a Koopa with Kofus. Okay. A Kamek boss fight. The Yoshi dojo. We might have to do the dojo next. Or the blue coin jumping here. With a little easter egg thing. We also have a pirate raid that happens at 65 stars. A pirate ship with a bunch of Shaggars and Piris. They raid the area and claim ownership. Defeat them all with their big boss. They need a big guy per star. The house and some roof reflects. Yeah. Okay I would say next step is make the entrance to Koopa with Kof happen here. With the seal. And then the pagoda. The dojo. We need to make the dojo happen. Snuffits are still real. No wait they're not. I killed them. But we can just make them real again. Anyway. I'm done for today. Yes. Good progress. Good progress. We made a tree and a basket. The tree especially I'm fairly happy with. Didn't think it would turn out this good. That will be it. And I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye-bye.
