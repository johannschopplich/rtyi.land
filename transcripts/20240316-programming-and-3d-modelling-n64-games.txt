What an animation, I call the animation comedy death. Okay, I think we can conclude, quicksand is not it, definitely not. Even this looks terrible, is that how everyone gets out of bed every day? The Mario animation there? Well okay, this texture is also terrible because it doesn't tile, let's actually try a decent Maybe this one's better? Surely sand 6 will be better than sand 21, clueless. What if we do some gameplay bullshit here? We add shade color here, subtract prim here. He always does fucked up combiners like this. It's not terrible. That's for sure. Looks like quicksand, really? Can we fade it? Yeah, we'd have to fade this. Well actually we can't really fade this in the combiner and it's also like really close to the gameplay area, which is kind of awkward. Does Eric hack quicksand right now? Oh, it's at least more detailed. I think it's a better idea to get pinned to the front for a bit, something like that. That would be very funny, but I don't want to program that. Yeah, just a weird true. If we did something like this, we probably have to fade out the alpha along the edge. I think that could look decent. Oh, why did it become so red, the fuck? That's why. I think now this could look fine-ish. So I'm wondering what a solution we don't have to fade the edges out. We could fade it into a different color, like a solid color that matches the background color. Yeah, that kind of works. Compiling takes forever. Yeah, these are the kind of things where you just have to try, see what happens, see how it turns out, I find. It definitely needs to fuck apply it, otherwise it looks really bad. Dude, I gotta get rid of this cliff in the skybox, it is pissing me off. One thing I worry about is that players might think they have to go to the bottom here. I'd like to prevent that a lot. We could also do a little bit of the Kalimari Desert thing, where there's a bunch of big cliffs in the background. The problem is, we can't really draw them too far out, because then we get render distance issues. This content is no longer available, awesome. I kind of like this, where there's a bunch of cliffs in the background, although our main area is like on top of one of those, so you wouldn't really see them. But the idea would just be that you see a lot of sand in the background. Basically something like this. So you just want it to be lighter, that's what you're saying, just make it lighter. I can try that. Awesome. Basically this. And the sides of the cliffs should be darker. Well, yeah, if we went with this, then of course I would make this darker here. No question about that. Yeah, you want this to be darker. Well, we won't make the bottom darker. I don't know if I want to make the top darker. We're making it slowly move. That could avoid the issue, yeah. The problem is, this texture is so big that it is not possible to make it slowly move, at least not cheaply. So that's an issue. Can't you render the distance cliffs in another layer like OOT renders in Skybox? Yes, that's what I would do. But that comes with some limitations. Well, actually, we could probably just place it in camera view and then give it a little far away. And it should work. The problem is, it's not going to interact with the real level geometry there. Okay, there we go. I just didn't see a quicksand bottom layer that looks like this. The circle plane, and it doesn't move. It should be darker so I can immediately tell from a standstill what the top of the ground is, what the side is, and what the quicksand pit is. True, that is a good point. Well, you would probably see the quicksand as just something being very far away, right? First of all, let me export this. And then let's export this again. We'll get this again. Do you know the F0 Sand Ocean Skybox? Maybe that's another inspiration. Let's see. F0 Sand Ocean. This one?  Interesting effect here. Interesting. Interesting. Interesting. That looks insanely cheap. It's basically just a few mountain billboards. It's a cool effect though, but I wonder what it would look like if you actually looked off the cliff here. Let's see. It just doesn't feel far away. I think that's because I need to turn on fog. Let me turn on fog and see. Let's see this again, actually. I should have turned on fog right away. Oh, but then I used shade alpha here. Oh, that's an issue. Let's just... Let's just see what this would look like. And we're just going to pretend that it's going to fade out at the edges. I'm trying to click on that, but it's sending me to F0 HD Facebook page. Let's see. I can't see the image here, by the way. That's very much not pretty. So, it is also kind of like an infinite thing. The fog shader will be the same color as the sand color. I don't want to change the fog color this late in. The fog color right now is very essential for the art style here. Making it all yellow would change the vibe a lot. But... I think we have to come up with a different solution. There is the obvious solution of just fade everything into blue at the bottom. You can just vertex color the sides of the level to fade it into the quicksand. I don't see how that makes any sense. How can you vertex color the sides to fade a quicksand into a texture? You can't set a color to a texture. I don't understand. Make the bottom of the sky with the same color as the sand and fade it. Yeah, yeah, that's what we would do. If you just fade it, don't use the resolution of not being randomly in the air. Yes, yes. Yeah, we would have it be very high up if we actually just faded this into blue or into clouds or whatever. That's exactly what it would be in Cetacean. I don't know if that's preferable. Damn, we should have thought about this like a long time ago. Hmm. What do other video games do? I wonder. They just go down. Yeah, they're just saying fuck it, it's level down there. Can't really do that. Making things fade to blue would make things look like they're disappearing, whereas the sand at the bottom would always make it feel like they're scrounged in the distance. That's kind of the way I'm thinking. Now I know what you mean. There is another option here. This is a very messed up effect that we can do here. But because it's so far away, it might not be so bad. Hmm. There has to be a better way to do this. Let's do combined. Prim. Shade. Prim. This is zero and this is... Inf and this is zero. And then Inf is like... This with a little less saturation. More than that. So that way we just have it fade into the background. And then the background would have the... This color here. Let me just make sure I got the background color right. So we can actually look at this properly. That was terrible. What the hell did I do here? Oh boy. Okay, well, we just have to guess the color. Looks very weird on the level, but I think this might work. I feel like making things fade to blue would make things look like they deserve... Yeah, yeah, okay, I already read that. Make them fade to orange. That doesn't fit the fog. Okay.  Can you apply the texture itself? To what? What texture? This whole skybox here is just math. There isn't really a texture there. This is very blue. But you can see my vision, right? Oh, I know why it's so blue. I know why. Do not worry. What you just saw was just a consequence of some false 64 hacks. This will look different, actually. As soon as it's exported. Okay. Yeah, okay. This kind of has a nice feeling, I think. And it's also very, very clear what you can't walk on. Hello, Clayman. I feel like this direction might work. Although it would be very cool if there was more in the background. It would be very cool if we could somehow connect the sand on our floor with the skybox. You know what I mean? I'm thinking how to do that. What if we faded the sand at the bottom into that? And then we have other cliffs that fade from the blue into a cliff. Like, you just have a cliff come out of nowhere there. And then you just see, like, the side of the cliff. No, I want the blue colors. That's already decided, Shanghai. We decided this when we started working on this level. It is too late to undo that. Hello, Cack Honka Honka. My favorite YouTube name. You're a Gooba. Okay. Interesting. Is there a way I can make this work next time I exported it so I don't have to deal with all the fast64 resetting my hex edits? The only way I see is to use colored sand from the get-go. You know what, fuck it. We're just gonna do this for testing. We're actually just gonna import colored sand. Maybe we can even find a better sand texture, wouldn't that be insane? Actually is it even really sand or is it more like gravel, cobblestone? Like something like this maybe that you would see. Theme prehistoric, let's try this. Right and we need shade alpha for the fork. Man, not being able to use shade alpha throughout the entire level is such a big limitation. Do we maybe need to make this more intense? I think we do. Hello g-boy, oh pluck is done, we need something else. Chrono trigger, all right. Hello Rainy, make a second sand transfer moving layer so it looks like the hot sun reflections. That's so expensive to render. You're basically overdrawing everything twice, you can't do that. Not on the n64, otherwise that would be a pretty nice idea. God, this is loud. Why is it so yellow? I didn't make it this yellow, did I? Let's play an emulator, no. Can we all together today rant about the fucking youtube stuff that is going on recently? I feel like almost every video I am recommended by youtube is some meaningless drama between people that no one should care about. It's like everything turned into like the 2008 squabbles of just people arguing over nothing that you would see in like magazines and on tv. Are humans just hardwired to be into that shit? Is that why? Even in nerd spaces it's like this faked speedrun tried to fool everyone, it's like no. The worst I see is like oh this blindfolded speedrun is fake and then it's just like super obvious 30 minute 16 star run that's very obviously not done blindfolded and they're talking about it as though this was like a big event that people cared about. No, no one cared. Five people saw it and then you made the video. Shut up. Ignore all rage bait and discount the people who try and do it. Yeah, I mean I don't care about it but it's like everywhere. Of course I don't get rage baited, I just get annoyed that it's there, that it's infiltrating my world. What did I miss? Nothing important. Go ahead and hit do not recommend channel and destroy the algorithm for them. Oh, that's an option? I feel like I heard that before and then just forgot about it. Honestly, I don't hate this. This looks kind of nice. Does do not recommend channel work properly? I don't know. Oh, but if we're going with this option, oh, we can do something cool. We can do something even better than this. We can make this texture ultra HD now that I think about it. But then I need to make it less round again. Cool. Awesome. There we go. The three little dots on starbase next to videos, I will keep that in mind. I say that but I don't get rage baited all the time. Yeah, I don't get rage baited usually. I just don't really care about most things. That's the cool thing for me. The power of not caring. Dude, has anyone seen Biobak recently? He's been gone for a while. He wanted to help me rework a bunch of levels. I hope he's not gone. That'd be really unfortunate for the case empire. Wait, I gotta tell them something important for now anyway. So, yeah, so fun fact, there was a company that approached me recently and they said they want to make an N64 game in 2024. Looks like they might be doing it, but we'll find out in June. If they do make one, that would be pretty hype. Hey chat, what are we doing? We're making the level prettier. How come? I guess they just want to do it. And I mean, it's kind of like a cool concept, right? I imagine it could sell. Just when you make a video game, especially like an indie game, usually your biggest issue is that no one even knows of your game. But if you have the marketing of, hey, this is an N64 game, but there's also a PC port available, it's kind of insane. That would make the news and you would get so much marketing for free. So, this level here is getting like pretty much easy 50, 40, something like that, I think. We could try it real quick. Although me adding this probably just kind of ruined the whole performance. So, let's simplify this a little bit. I think we do want to go with this, so I think it's fine to actually start optimizing this a little bit. Did you still optimize the engine or do you think you're close enough to 100% of the N64's power? There's still some optimizations left. On the table. So, it's being a sunset, rice, orange, blue would make sense for the lighting, but it's high noon. The sun has to be from above. It's all about being cowboys. Yes, yes, that is all possible, G-Boy. We might be doing that. I actually, the plan I outlined earlier would add big cliffs in the background, which I can show in a little bit once I'm actually getting there. So, so, so, so the reason we did that, it does add polygons, but it reduces overdraw a lot, so it's good. If a deathmatch 64 game had ports to Switch or Steam similar to QEV64, I think fans of the dev console would be very likely to support it. Yeah, that and also just it would make a lot of people hear about it. If it was a good game on top of it, then people would probably get it. Once they hear about it. Okay, so I'm thinking we do this and the next we have one of those background cliffs there. We put them in the background layout. And this doesn't make any sense. We do something else. I have a similar idea to that. Hello, Liliana. Okay, similar idea. Best VG cliffs. We have a second layer. We get a little parallax effect. Can I get a nerd emoji in chat for that one? Um, and then... So for this, we don't actually need fuck anymore. We'll just pretend there's fuck on it. Um, no Z-Buffer VG text. I want the uh... Oh shit, I didn't mean to do that. I'm gonna copy this. Dude, you know what's crazy? When I changed the skyboxes in Mario 64, people were telling me, Case, you're clearly an idiot. They were going for a parallax effect. They didn't just fuck up the math. No, no, no. It's a parallax effect. You don't know what you're talking about, bro. So, I'm convinced if it's gonna retro, I'm gonna use this. It worked. Yeah. So, this is gonna be difficult to get the color similar. So, never mind. Oh, actually, yes, that is difficult. How am I... How am I gonna do that? And then worst of all, we also need to add the blue to this. Shit. So, oh, actually adding the blue is easy. I just two cycle, combined, prim, shade alpha, prim, set this to one. Okay. So, I think you guys will like this idea here. Remove this right here, where the skybox would be. And then we go over the outline. We set the alpha to zero. Do I need to set the alpha to one? Um, okay. Before I do that, I also need to do this one. So, has it been an instrument show? Well, I've said before that it's my favorite movie. So, there you go. So, so, okay. I think you can see my vision here now. So, honestly, I should have used the full color here, instead of this one. And I also don't know why this does this. This is very weird. But I'm just going to assume that's a Fast64 rendering bug. So, that's a description of the movie. Yes, in a giant dome that monitors him 24-7. I mean, it's true, but that sounds very ridiculous when you put it like that. 12. You know what? I want it to be anywhere but here. I want it to be like here. So, we can actually see it correctly. If I did everything right, we now have a cliff that is far away and has some fog on it. Yep, we broke into Krona Trigger music. Have you ever played the levels you've created? Of course, I play them. How am I going to test them without playing them? So, play Madness on April Fools? Right, I have my wife play it too on April Fools. Where the fuck is my thing? I forgot to set one value, that's why. So, we want the low far awayness here. People make fun of me for calling this far awayness, but you cannot tell me that this is distance. Distance is not a good name for this. It is far awayness, trust me. I was planning to make a like three-hour video game water essay, but I decided against it. Okay, so that's interesting, to say the least. It doesn't look as I thought it would. Why does it render like this? Oh, that's why. This level have any lagspots? I have not noticed any. And the performance is gonna get even better once we have F3DEX3 with the occlusion planes. Fun fact, Lila, I don't know if you were here for it, but we found out my F3DEX3 lags on my romhack and not on anyone else's. You wanna know why? I'm gonna brag about this forever. This is what Sauraen told me. What do you think? He said he thinks that in Return to Yoshi's Island the memory and RDP is so optimized that with F3DEX3 the RSP becomes the bottleneck. And because F3DEX3 has more RSP costs, that is likely it. So he's making a version of F3DEX3 that has some optimized RDSP. I think this would work if the color was a bit better. Imagine this all around the level. It's very cheap to render too. I don't know why the color is that off though. That's weird. I thought the color would be at least close. Let me check what my fog color is. This is the color of my fog. So this is the color that the prim should be here. Aha. That's why it looks weird. It's starting to come together. True. So now if Sauraen actually finishes his F3DEX3 upgrade or change that removes some features but optimizes the RSP we will likely see like an instant huge performance boost. It will be big. Especially once we re-export the levels with the new vertex count and better material and lining. Things are looking pretty good. Okay this would look fine if it was not for the background just having a different color than the fog. Oh there's another factor to this and that is that the fog never actually fully clips in. So realistically it's like a less saturated version of this. We're gonna pick something else. Do we make this the official color? Oh what the hell? Do we make this the official color? Color maybe? And then this also has to fit that color. Make the font brighter in the background so you don't notice the missing space. We make them the exact same color so there's no missing space. The problem is like the fuck? Combine color alpha multiple by combine color. This is such a weird combiner. This combiner is unworkable. Really? First of all really we want a combiner that can combine colors. It'll fit each color perfectly. Let's change the wallpaper, for example, you know the size and everything. Okay, here we go, so we have the game and it goes there. No, not this one, the graphics... Even better we go there. HDR Although we disabled that and the bottleneck was still there, so I don't actually know if he's right on saying that's the RSP. But it is what he said he thinks the issue is. For like the cell shading and the specular stuff. I think he has to process vertices in a different order. Yeah, okay, so I don't understand how this could pop. What the fuck? Oh, I had the sun combiner open somehow. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Okay, now they all three have the same color and this should look good. I think adding a bit more variety into the hills in the background would benefit the level after a bit more so it wouldn't look too boring. Also, hello. Yes, I'm a guy. That's basically the plan. Oh, I forgot to export the level. Hello, Jan. So. To the arguments happening in my discord are so funny. They're getting so stupid. People are arguing about nothing in my discord nowadays and then people are just making unfounded assumptions. And like, yep, this is it. Will he move point lights for the theoretical version? I don't know. I mean, he's free to do it because I don't use them. If he doesn't do it, I will probably do it. Why is it so bright? So saturated. Um, ignore my message. I'm just storing that there. Actually, that's a bad idea. I'm just gonna type this into discord. Fuck RGB. Okay. Whoever's setting my discord will be very confused by this, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. Why is it that has to be a render issue? Generally, I don't think this is my, my mistake. Let me check this out on NEMU. This might just be a project 64 exclusive bug. Champions route for the first time while doing items with Mario in 64 lands. Or in one of those Nintendo games. Nope, this is generally just how it looks for some reason. How can that be? Did I not export it? True. Did you miss the windows key? Plus we can bring up the clip. What is it? True. But what if I need it tomorrow? What is bro cooking? Bro is cooking this. Look at this. We're trying to make the background here more interesting. But for some reason that color there is just not matching. And the math should work out to match the color exactly. So now it looks like shit for no reason. Mic gong. You get a mic gong for that one. One free mic gong for everyone. That's a good one. Did I ruin this texture? Wait, did I ruin this texture here? I feel like this used to look better. Did I break it? I broke it. I swear I broke it. It didn't look like this before, right? It looked way better before. What happened? Oh no. It looks so shitty now. Hello Seymour Sam. What did I do? No. The fuck does match the fade out? Oh really?  Guys, when did I break this? Has to be due to the wrong sand texture being hooked up now, right? Wasn't I closer to this before? That looks much closer to what I remember it to be like. Nanta, that's the exact problem we are working on right now. The fork not looking right. But like it should look right. What if I just make more of it? How is this gonna look like? This will look terrible, but I want to see what the color is now. Ctrl-Z. You can't just Ctrl-Z that. That was like 20 minutes ago when it changed. But don't worry, I remember inputting the value of 0.23 there. So I'm pretty confident that that is the bug I made. Subpoena on forced child labor. It's probably not good for a child. Does the power meter scale with widescreen or console 2? Yes. The fuck? I swear it's literally one to one the same color in blender. What do you mean it's not the same? I know what the issue is. I know what the issue is. The actual level fock is applying to this and ruining the color. The level fock is more saturated than the actual fock we use. And that is ruining the color because we didn't want the level to fade into fully saturated fock. Oh, that's stupid. Shit. There's no easy solution here. Unless we change the level fock. Turning it white might work. Well, I mean, if we change the level fock, of course we can fix it. And we don't even have to turn it to white, I think. And this is why I have this in my discord, because now I can just Ctrl-V this. What if we tried this? This should look almost the same and not have the issue. I always thought you said fuck instead of fock. No. How does fock sound like fuck? There's a clear O in there. What if the blue in the blue in skybox was just yellow-brown? I know we moved past this, but I think this will be really good. No, it's gonna ruin my buildings. You can't do volumetric fock like that. It's purely distance-based. Yeah, this makes the whole level look a lot foggier, which is a bit the issue. Maybe. Okay, wait. We decreased the saturation of the fock, so now the fock matches exactly this color. Now we can back again increase this value here to get the exact, almost the exact same fock without any of the downsides. Sure, it will be slightly heavier fock, but it's not gonna be the same as before. It should look the same, roughly. I'm gonna say anything, but I too heard you say fock instead of multiple times instead of fock. I say fock every single time. We've been over this. I cannot pronounce fock correctly. Okay, it is what it is. Fockin' brilliant. True. Why is there a train down there? What? How did that get there? Damn, Lilaa, where the fock are you? Is that where you've been? You've just been at the torture facility. Do I need to get you out of there, Lilaa? Are you okay? Okay. What's the point of the rotating elevator next to the bridge at the start of Bomberfield? What is the point? Just to look cool, I guess. Okay, so it looks like this train here doesn't actually do train things. It just kinda goes off the rails. And I don't know why.  Oh, I see why. The rotation was wrong. All right, now that we have that, we can add more of the cliffs. I've had worse? Lilaa, what is happening to you? Do you need help? Wait, so you're actually dying or something? That's really sad, if it's true. Let's just check up. Oh, okay. Good. I thought we've been making Rip Lilaa jokes for a while now, and then actually you just have like bone cancer or something. That would have been pretty tragic.  not that you're aware of. Well, that's good at least. If you're not aware of bone cancer, you probably don't have that much bone cancer. Do you want to know what game is fucking sick? Yu-Gi-Oh! Could you imagine if they didn't ruin the game? Holy shit. They couldn't be as big as Pokemon. Do-do-do-duel. True. And I've been the bad bone density allegations also lost weight of 36. Doesn't estrogen make your bones thicker though? I'd feel like you'd have more bone density now. Does it reduce your bone density under your conditions? Do. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about having fun. Eye-eye. Way earlier. I exited with elemental heroes. That was too much for me. I don't like archetypes. Probably Digimon. Dude yes, Digimon really fucked up. Dude the games Digimon made. Digimon World 1 was like their first game. That game fucking sucked. I know we're all nostalgic for it and I like the game a lot, but the game like objectively fucking sucks. And then I played Digimon World 4, which is not even really a Digimon game. It's just like you are Digimon with a weapon and you hit like random enemies. There is one movement option. Thank you for the donation. Shit I missed that. I missed your donation. What was it? Who donated? Who do I need to thank for this? Digimon World kinda good? No way you think it's actually good. That game is so garbage. I played it with my wife. It was unplayable even with two people. Ah Riolu thank you for the sub. I did not know that Digimon World 1 has a PC port and I do not want to play it because the game fucking sucks. As long as I don't play it I don't want to play it. I don't want to play it. I don't want to play it. Which train is that? This one here? That makes sense. Why is the rotation also fucked up? I did say that World 4 sucks yes. Digimon Rumble Arena 1. Dude we have fun playing Digimon Rumble Arena 2. That game is actually really fun. If you could turn off the items in that they have some of that ready. They have Cyber Sleuth and Hacker's Memory. They are actually pretty good. They are just like better Pokemon games. First game is so much better. I had no idea. Smash 64 and Smash 4. No way. Digimon Rumble 2 is like Smash 4. If that counts as Smash 4 then the other one has to be so rough. Digimon Rumble 2 is like so unpolished. You know what really annoyed me about getting blood taken this time. For the first time in my life I was on remotely freaking out and my mom was just like telling me to not look and stuff like come on. Don't get scared lil baby it's just a needle. I know mom. Shut up mom. We be riding the train. The main character is losing a duel so he starts cheating making up whole new rules and counts just to win. What? That's what happened in the anime? The guy just cheated and that's how Pendulum Monsters came to be? That's funny as fuck. They have used the same space as actual infants. Well you are a child right? You're not 18 yet. You're basically just like a toddler. Have you seen the clip of Vsauce saying that babies don't have a soul? They're like almost sentient but not really. Can we extend that to people under 18? Doing like 6 tubes worth of blood in my arm. There isn't that much blood in a tube right? A tube is just like 8ml so that's like 48ml. I don't like mystery dungeon games. I think mystery dungeon games are the worst. I played one mystery dungeon game that wasn't a pokemon game and that was also not playable and I had explorers of time and I just couldn't finish it. Peep this. Yeah this is definitely a game from 2005. Holy shit. Well actually this is probably earlier than that. Okay this does look better than the second game. Like this is definitely a graphical update. Wanna hear a joke? Yes Agirov tell me a joke. Right I wanna fix the train. I don't like how the train is not changing its pitch. This shouldn't be a goal pitch. What's another way of saying coming in a woman? There's like 50 answers to that and we have so many synonyms for coming in a woman. I don't know Agirov what is it? Even being amongst ink that's what I was going to say. Oh okay. Loading the dishwasher. Yeah I knew that one. Here we need the pitch to also change to whatever the surface is. That'll be dark. Should cancel whoever told that joke. True. Agi I feel like if you were more famous you would get cancelled a lot. Yeah you know what this function is just right. Wait is that a Trump joke? Oh this spins too fast. Whoops. This spins way too fast. What the hell? So he used to talk about boobs in video games and now he knows about science and fingers. We all know that. Okay that's a bit too slow but I like that this kind of works. Okay so you like the train? That's good. I don't like the train anymore. Nice lilac ceiling let's go. Oh I got omega killed. Okay with this background here this is giving me much better vibes. This much better works. Oh yeah oh yes yes yes yes this is good. And then we have one in the actual world that is like nearby. I feel like that makes the illusion perfect. Okay sex sounds. You're like 15 you don't know what that even means. So you don't want to panic monsters appear in anime watch it whenever to see how stupid it is. All right I will watch that I want to see that. You're 19. Oh okay never mind you can't know what sex is. Wait it feels like yesterday when you were 9. Wait what? Didn't you join my discord when you were literally 9 years old? In like 2018. Am I crazy here? Are you 13 then? Oh Okay I think the background works. Next question is what do we do for the second area? Do we like the clouds though? I kind of like the clouds. Like this was just something I kind of made up out of nowhere But now that it's here I don't even mind that. I think it has a very nice look actually. It looks very fluffy. We still need something for this area here. We probably just actually we don't have to make any cliffs here. We definitely have to do something with a lot though otherwise it looks so floaty in the sky. The clouds look too transparent. That's funny because they are opaque. They're not transparent at all. The night cycles would be cool. Yes but if you make that you have to make the level with that in mind from the get-go. Let's check this out on N64 and see how it performs. If I can find my SD card reader on my desk anywhere. It's right here. You didn't want to say the SD card reader. I don't know what the S word is. Lilaa, you're 17. You don't know what the S word is. What's the flashing zero about? That's a debug number for the current action of Boshi the Yoshi. Is this why I couldn't compose for any reason? Because you think I'm two years old? No, the reason you are not the first person to ask to compose for RTYI is because my dupe wants to make all of it. Is that thing I defy because I'm bored? I'm starting to say S word. Is that thing you defy because you're bored? The cut tracks are also very good. I wish I could put Shanghai Heroes in. It's such a good song. I'm hoping that I can release RTYI alongside an OST cartridge. This is going to be loud as fuck if I don't turn this down. Let's mute the OST. Please don't crash. Okay, 55 FPS when we're not looking at the level. Good start. 30. And we didn't even optimize or put FADX3 in yet. Oh, that's crazy. Oof, that hit 26 for one second, but that's fine. Dude, this actually looks incredible for N64. You can even see these. 29. You failed, big guy. Oh, no. This has to be the laggiest view in the level, like from here going over here. That's perfectly fine. 25. Especially considering we didn't put Occlusion Planes in yet. If you cap the FPS, it doesn't stay at 30. Capping the FPS does slightly increase it. Let's try that. All right, let me go here, turn on capped FPS, and see if that's any better. That's not too different. Do you guys actually think Banjo-Tooie looks as good as this? Because I just don't think so. Banjo-Tooie very much just didn't play into the N64 aesthetic, if you know what I mean. It tried to be the super modern... I don't know. I don't know if that makes sense. The clouds would look better if they were more fuller and whiter. I think these clouds look really good for what we put into them. Just like math formulas. That's true, but we still have Dynamic Lighting to add, so maybe we will make up for that. Oh, that's a capture card bug. The crazy part about this is that I made this level layout knowing that this would be difficult to run, and I made this under the assumption that I would be able to use the culling planes. Wait a second, you see that? Enable Culling isn't even on. We're not even culling these buildings. Wait, we're not culling any of these buildings here. Let me turn that on real quick. Let's try that again with Culling enabled. How the fuck is it running? And yes, I'll tell you if nothing is being culled. And it's like 10,000 triangles too. And then imagine the new F3DX version on top of that. How the fuck did LRT not even reach solid 30 FPS? Because they ain't me. Why was he dancing? He was dancing? That's definitely a bug if he was dancing. Not intended at all. Are you going to add structural support underneath the train tracks? Yes. Moving from Mario Exclusive would make insane shit with it. True. Well, this is not a Mario Exclusive engine anyway. Well, a lot of the music in the game obviously is midi-fied, so it's going to not sound as good as on SoundCloud.
