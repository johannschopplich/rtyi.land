Hello? Oh, there we go. Great, my restream broke once again, so we will spend the beginning of the stream trying to log in. I should have been more prepared, but I was busy pooping. Sorry about that. Shit, I'm not on my Twitch channel yet. I cannot see any messages anyone writes. There we go. Hello, NeoVim. Let me just log into this, and then we're gonna... I'm gonna tell you guys what I've been doing, and then we make some progress, I hope. Shut up first. Shut up. You shut up. Sad face. Beta, thank you for subscribing to this channel. Don't sad face me. Select pictures of crosswalks? Oh, I got my password right. First try. I'm a genius. Alright guys, type something in chat so I can tell whether it works or not. Hello, YoshiNamedFace. What? My restream doesn't work?  Enable channels here? Oh my god. Did I log into the wrong account? I must have. Let's try this again. Select pictures of crosswalks, really? Place your frame... You're right, that is fucked up. Why is it fucked up like that? Oh, don't do that. Okay, phew. Let me select more pictures of crosswalks, so hopefully I can see my chat soon. Oh, please try again. I guess I'm a robot. I cannot pick crosswalks. Now they're putting me on fire hydrants. Maybe I can tell what a fire hydrant is. Oh my god, does it work? Hold on, we're connecting your channels. Please work. To activate chat, please enable channels here. What is this shit? There's two channels added here. I'm just gonna restart restream. I think it works. Yes, it works! Okay, we can stream. Let's fucking go. Zaina's birthday? She makes me celebrate her birthday every single day. Just tell everyone to move to YouTube. No, it's not gonna work. I have been working on something exciting off stream. And that is a new operating system for the Nintendo 64. Kind of. Kind of difficult to talk about operating system when you're talking about N64. Basically, the operating system Nintendo wrote for Mario 64 sucked. And then later they wrote one called Libultra, and it still sucks. So I'm just gonna write a better one. Hello, Biobak? I met the second person ever to respond to Harry Rester with, thanks, you too. Nice. How's the choccy milk? How do you know about me eating choccy milk? Are you following me? What is assembly in CCC? Yes, actually. I finally figured out how to properly just program an assembly. We are free, dude. We have been freed from the oppression that compilers have caused us. Yeah, it's Zaina's birthday every day. She makes me celebrate it. See, okay, what actually happened earlier this day. So you guys don't know this, but Zaina makes me celebrate her birthday every day. And this morning I didn't say happy birthday to her. So she got so upset to me. She said, dude, Case, you are worthless. You do not deserve hair on your head. And then she just shaved me again. You're wearing my YouTube shorts, germaning about choccy milk. Oh, I know what you're talking about. So strong treats you. Dude, we're both abused. Fun fact. The dupe made two separate videos.      Two songs for us. So this is the song he was thinking for the ice castle. You've watched me for almost six years. You have seen Bored Case then. It isn't new. This song isn't new. Wait, do you know this song? When did he upload this? So I don't like how this level looks at all. Some extra playlists. The dupes sound crazy. He's not shouting me at all. I'm just surprised that he had this here before. Dude, my controller is so fucked. Do you see this? I'm holding full down. It does this. There's what I'm saying. I think this just looks like garbage like all around. And we need something different entirely. No, I don't like this.    No, no, no, no, no, no. Luckily, they didn't show anything bad. Still. I'm going to control every time. Just buy one. Fair. Oh, let's see this. What was the bonus track? Oh, this is very similar. You're right. And he also did the space song already. Good luck with coding. Thank you, Blue Harvey. This sounds really familiar to a lot of songs to me. Wait for it. Like right now. You know the section.  Right. The artwork one of the second areas looks so cool. You might miss yourself.  All right. Last impact. Guys, I'm gonna keep it real with you. I don't understand basketball. It seems like the stupidest sport imaginable to me. Do the rules even make any sense in the game? Isn't it like so wishy-washy when you're like touching someone and when you're not? That's kind of interesting. Yeah. And I still didn't get a decent answer. What's this supposed to mean? It's like a mysterious ice palace place type deal. No, right now we're just trying to get an interesting art style going something that's like something we can use for the whole level without it just looking bad. Oh, Robert's collab is still going. Is it like almost done at least? Yeah, it looks terrible. But I'm trying to get it to look somewhat good. It's just not working. Like it's not intended to look terrible if that's what you're asking. Dude, why is my mouse so slow? We need an OST. Oh nice, nice. We have to try that. Trying to make people finish a thing in time is impossible. Yeah, but wasn't he supposed to just like finish everything that wasn't finished by other people? I guess it's not that easy. I know that they got screwed over a lot on the development side. By one person saying that they want to make a level and then that person just didn't. Which is like the biggest dick move ever. Pikmin free OST? Alright, let's do it. Sonic Adventure, always good, but maybe we've listened to that one a little too much. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't believe in this looking good either. But let me just take a look at this in game. Maybe this can inspire something. Maybe we just need to look at more ice castles. I have a sheer headache. Yeah, this looks really bad as expected. This is too loud. Alright, Zayna. Is this inside of an igloo? No, it's gonna be an ice castle. A big castle made out of ice. The problem is it just doesn't look good. And we're trying to like figure out what to make it look like. So we can use ChatGPT as a concept arting tool if we want. It can usually find like decent ones. I want more contrast and less details. You know, sometimes it comes up with interesting pictures that we can use as like a visual to aim for. Ideas for sculptures. Yeah, yeah. See, this doesn't look like it's made out of ice. This looks like it's made of bricks. It doesn't capture the feeling. No, Fryza. I just use this for concept art. This is not for generating ideas. This is just for like what are our options available. So I look at this and I'm like, okay, well, the columns here are kind of nice. Maybe something like this would work in a castle. It's like a better Google search, basically. And we're going to use some ravens. But no, I don't want any details on this castle at all until we don't have the overall art style for this castle. Frozen. Oh, frozen is a good idea. Let's look at frozen castle. Okay. This is very textureless. Interesting. This has a nice amount of contrast too. Adventure time ice king layer. Let's see what that looks like. It's maybe a bit too abstract. I like this image a lot. Like this is pretty much the vibe I want to go for. True violet, true. Should we try and go for this aesthetic here just to see how that would look like on N64? Let's try it. Okay. So the way we're going to do that, I think, is we have one dark outside and one bright inside to these elements here. Okay. Let's do that. Yeah, this is true. Let me just see what the vibe of this is. I mean that your link is invalid. Doesn't lead me anywhere. Hello, Lilo Heaven. The opaque part is missing, why is the opaque part missing? I guess I set this to the wrong random mode. Oh, let's try that again. It looks textureless now, that's what the castle looks like. In order to even do reflections in this moment you need to create textures from current paint then. Well, of course anything is possible, but it's not very reasonable. It doesn't look like much, but… What if we just cannot do this? I feel like that might look nice. Dude, does this song ever stop? I hate the pigment free OST. I can't do this anymore. Okay. Okay. I think this has something. There's something to be said about this. What if we apply this to the walls too? I just clicked on literally anything that looked somewhat viable, I just can't listen to the pigment OST anymore. Oh my god, I hated that so much. Try this, images.app.go. That doesn't really give me an idea for what the castle should look like. I'm throwing up at the thought of the geometry. I see what you mean. I can definitely see why someone who has to model in this style would think that whatever I just made is very concerning. Geometry is easy, not easy, but definitely easier than overdraw, yeah? Although there is both overdraw and geometry here. But it doesn't matter, because this is inside basically. That's the idea. Oh yeah, this one is really well done, 64 too. Yoshi, you said this three times now. I did that too, just for reaction time in Smash Mini. That's what I started working out for. I'm building their second random noise modifier here. Red station. Yeah, this is pretty nice. This is kind of what I'm trying to make here. I like this a lot. The one big problem we'll have is that we can't do the darkness here unless we give up on the environment map or on the fog. Eeeh. New vertex randomize. Yeah, I guess. But doesn't this place work too? It's interesting, right? Let's try it. So then... Let's see what it looks like. Yeah, my new collision system is a lot more stable than the vanilla one. So we don't have to worry about that as much. You just sent me some pictures you found. Okay, I'll look at that in a second. It looks so fuzzy. Does it not? But I still don't like it, to be honest. Maybe it looks better triangulated. It's better, but I still don't really like it. I think I'm just gonna make the difference here. Well, I mean, it's an nth map, right? So no matter what the texture is gonna be, it's always gonna look kinda like this, right? Eeeh. It looks goofy and not mysterious. This is kinda true, yeah. Not a fan of this style, to be honest. We could try to do it with the little arrows, but let's look at what Zeina sent me first. So this was the one we were looking at. And I really like this part here. So that is worth considering. Interesting, but the ordering of the rendering here is gonna be impossible. I don't think that's gonna work, by the way. Okay, so blocks made out of ice. Looks very cool. But I can't think of an N64 combiner to do this. The ice cannot go enough time kinda looks like ass, to be honest. Don't like this one. This also looks really nice. It's missing a lot of the contrast I like, but... Eeeh. This one is kinda nice, too. But this is what I liked. I think we need to give up on fog. Yeah, exactly that's what I want. Deep blues and bright whites. But I think if we give up on fog, we have a better shot at this. Outrops. Outrops. Outrops. Team Drake or Team Kendrick? Which one was Kendrick again? What does he do? Does he make music? Or is he like a basketball player? Kendrick just revealed that Drake has a secret daughter. Oh no, they're both rappers. Ah, okay. Team Kendrick. In that case, I will choose... Team Kendrick. Because I know who Drake is and I know I don't like Drake's music. So Kendrick can only be better, right? I didn't even know he was black. You are putting that in my mouth. Oh no, people are genuinely discussing this. Look what you did, Mr. Comet. Oh no. Oops. Ah, not quite what I'm looking for. Could give atmosphere. Ah, okay.       No, that looks awful. That's just a fake little poly thing that indie devs do. We have no Quark flower? No. The comp thing has to be prepared correctly. It might be with a stream delay. But yeah, we'll get there. What are you making this time? Ice Castle. It's an extra archive I use. Available somewhere? No. You know what? I don't want to listen to this fucking sleepy ass music. Guys, give me something more hype. We need good music here. I can't listen to this shit. Can't track this. Can't see the rain. No. Did I find the right art style? No. I'm still looking for it. We're experimenting. I think we can try one of these textures. Let's try this one. I think that's a fucking sick look. You skipped a low poly gorilla image? The what? Okay, you know what? I'm listening to the fucking Kendrick Lamar Drake hater song. Kendrick Lamar Drake. It's legit.     Let's listen to this. Move the greyhams. Let's fucking go. I know nothing about them. This guy sounds like shit. Is this like an April 1st diss track? That's not how you make a diss track. I could make a better diss track than that. He doesn't sound like he's rapping. This sucks. This is actually funny though. This song is fucking stupid. Is that how you do a diss track? This doesn't go hard at all. What is this ass? Let's listen to the Madros Mask OST. Rofl while I sleep on the mic. The comments on the diss track are so funny. Nah. Just calling this one the greatest diss track of all time. He doesn't get it. No fucking way. Oh my god. They've never heard the good German diss tracks. They're so much better than the American ones. I swear. It's not even close. Piss track. Yeah, exactly. That's a piss track. Disstrack of you and your native tongue? I do not speak Spanish. I would not be able to understand that. How much of a diss is it if you have to explain it afterwards? You know what I mean? This is a diss track against CluckyDev. Dude, my diss track against Spaceman64  went harder. One of the most comfortable blue jeans? I don't know. Sure, Lila. Whatever you say. Kings vs Galaxys diss track. Dude, I could go so fucking hard on that. Oh my god. Do it.  That would just be like... I would get cancelled. The thing is, if I made a diss track, I would get cancelled no matter what. Because I think art is about making you feel emotion. And if I made a track like that, I would want to make you feel pure hatred. And the track would go beyond YouTube guidelines. You know what I mean? This is a real diss track. This one is hard. Let's listen to this one. You'll be fine. I will not be fine. Let's see how I do this. It's kind of like triangles like that. That's what I was thinking. The best diss track ever written. No contest, bro. You as a fraud yeah i'll be blowing you up who said you were a god i know it wasn't plug been here 10 years and you know i'm showing up for a man in many words i think you said enough but the only way to make your hush first i'll body bag your fox then die zip it shut i'ma put you in your place kid you were disgraced get killed quick like that missile hit you in the face after all this you'll be watching your mouth ain't no telling who'll be calling you out salty sweet goes down you better come correct you win the major show your elders some respect fucking hard p.s left and i ain't done yet i'm the underdog so place your bets whoever wanna see left and looking dumb throw your money on the line cuz i'm making some gotta say bro you looking awfully weak wait and see what happens in the salty sweet vanilla fox oh shoot you go yes he did get bodied right after this he got completely destroyed it was not even close what the fuck songs to vibe to is what planned all right fuck it we'll listen to this now have we evolved enough to use based unironically yes never mind i don't like this anymore back to trance mask you know what maybe listening to a bunch of different songs while we're trying to figure out the art style for this isn't so bad because there's so much inspiration what's the texture i'm looking for i think it was some kind of global texture this one might work as an nf map so what we're gonna do i'm gonna make this an nf map and this is gonna be it's fucking loud it's gonna be a two cycle man and then um no op opaque so if we do text zero by shade by zero and then combined by shade alpha we can make it or even better what if we lerp by shade alpha something like minus prim plus prim this is just one this is just one and then we can prim to dark blue we can make the outline black and then we can have walls that look like this hello i'm your cat so lila with the greasy hair honestly you're nobody's surprise when my hair was long it was very greasy too at least i think it was i don't know actually i didn't know what hygiene was until i was like when i'm hitting it because i used to play smash bros you know so don't some people put like grease in their hair on purpose but some of that so i wish you could make linked copies without breaking class 64 that would be so nice i mean just delete all this again and make this link copies and then unlink the copies i guess so there's no back scales so let's try it what gap why are you just saying thanks I mean it's kinda cool impressive but you also don't like it from a geo standpoint now how much of an annoyance it is to make this is definitely gonna be a factor but I also don't know how to fix that you're not mad at me I love you as myself thank you mom yes can you believe it my mom is in chat you think this can be done with geo notes to just have these follow a wall it's the first time someone was actually good though yeah I agree  bending the icicles into the middle it's gonna get even worse from a geo perspective but let's try it oh god this is the most charismatic of all time I've been disappointed in you swearing dang it I don't think my parents ever cared whether I swore or not you ruined it why it's gone please you can never recover from this uh I mean it's kind of cool having it be rounded but I also don't really think it's good  yeah I don't I'm not a believer in the rounded mode here unless maybe we use a linear falloff let's try that what is a sharp shining effect so it's like Mario 64 to be honest do you think it looks bad actually kind of like the the falling in here so the question is is there a way to make this without just being really really painful to you know maintain in the future can we make a pattern out of this the ice needs to be brighter that would be pretty easy to do geo notes how would you do that with geo notes later the big platform doesn't have anything yet this is this is pending so we're painting to assign the walls I need a more in-depth tutorial here destination yeah I'm sure there's a destination solution here I'm sure we could just make like a pattern here oh but if you do have a pattern then all the sides have to be even right so that doesn't really work 3d textures made out of meshes oh interesting use weight paint to assign the okay geo notes use weight paints to assign the walls then add random objects spaced out properly boom um okay I'm just gonna try what Lila just said we have this then we add a geo node whatever that's gonna do without the geo node function and then use weight paint to assign the walls okay weight paint weight paint to assign the walls then add random objects spaced out properly are you sure this is gonna do anything Lila? all right let's add a random object spaced out properly nothing's happening Lila what are you doing? I'm doing exactly what you told me to do I added geo node I weight painted it and then I added random objects you need to create the nodes see you skipped that part see I've never done this before how how did I work um let's just see oh like this is what it can do where's the geo node tab I guess I don't have one I guess it's gonna be general geometry nodes okay now what I didn't modding okay let me check that it's the discussion channel modding discussion that one all right I've got your tessellation demo let me take a look at that question why did you block me in discord because you're really annoying so why didn't you block me yesterday did you finish my tournament so you prefer an age limit for your streams you have to abide by twitch terms of service so you have to be 13 what does this do oh I have to select an object I have to use a collection can use a one by one plane object to make a mesh texture so I guess I'm guessing I have to make the mesh texture somewhere and then after I've made the mesh texture I have to apply it somewhere so I'm guessing I make it by just modifying this here is that what's going on but then how do I apply it afterwards so let's say I wanted to just you know make my little thing here  yeah no created plane object okay and use that as a texture at zero zero okay that didn't seem to do anything oh wait so okay wait wait wait I think I get it now so what if I put this over here and fuse this with this no this still doesn't look like a texture to me  there's your base scatter geo node interesting I might look at that if this doesn't work you may need to play with this modifier so yes it's not a one by one plane I guess it's a two by two all right this works I'm surprised you even have a girlfriend yeah look Mr. Comet you still here that is number one hater behavior you thought the Kendrick Lamar this track is good look at VintageTen right now Mr. Comet out can I use the UV mapping here to do things you can't use the UV mapping so what is it based off what the fuck It's the next topless stream. When it gets too warm again. I can't squash this with the UV map. That definitely needs to be changed. Why don't you try setting the rotation of the face using the underside tools. Oh, I mean the rotation is fine. Ah, I see. It does have all three at least, so if you extrude it will get messed up. I mean, yeah, but I mean that's not supposed to be right. Does it still work if I do this? Oh, oh, now the rotation is all wrong. That's not good. Is there no consistent way to get the rotation? No, you see, I don't have an only fence. Let's see, someone else wrote a scatter thing, but I don't know what the scatter thing does. Hmm. Where does it get the rotation? Maybe I can just fix the code here. Oh, I see, yeah, we need a certain rotation. The rotation is non-negotiable, so that it's not going to work. You just cut a code, of course this is code, what do you mean? So, remove the random value on yours. But then where does it get the rotation from? Right, at that point I might as well just try to get this one to work the way I want. Although I've never really made GeoNodes, so this is going to be all new for me. The normal, you can't just get it from the normal, or actually, I guess you can get the forward vector and that would be good enough, yeah. Where does this get the rotation? Randomized position, sure, might be good. Randomized rotation, definitely not. Well, Lele, you didn't tell me how to do it, so. Group input, oh, it's this one here. It adds zero to it, then multiplies it by 1.5, what the fuck? Why is it multiplying by this value? All of that for something that won't be sustainable long-term, that will not look good enough. You don't think it will look good, Biobak? Oh, right, this is like pi divided by two, it's not tau. I don't hate you, BMGma, I just think you're really annoying, that's literally it. I am very indifferent towards you, I just do not enjoy your presence. When do I add objects to a spinning part of the geometry, not objects? Wedding vows, go to answers. Oh, I see. Yeah, I still see the honey in Monika's skirt. Okay, interesting idea, Lele. But if Biobak says this doesn't look good, honestly, we're cooked. It just needs a texture, it already has a texture. It should be way brighter, it's, are you sure? I don't think it can get much brighter. What, do you think this is good now? Yeah, I see what you mean. We can keep looking around and trying to find the art style. But this is the first time the level looked good, so I do enjoy that part. I think it really be difficult to make a transition into things. Lele, I don't want a low number, I want them to be dense, but having it completely random is not good, because we want it to not be completely random. So if it be completely random, they're each other. No tenacious, or well, I mean, if we went with it, yes, I would appreciate the video. But right now, we are not even 100% sure that we want to use the modifier, because I'm not sure that I want to use this type of wall yet. I'm not lost on the modifier, I'm lost on this, on making this look good. Does she wear skates just to reduce the density? It literally looked random in the video, or in the screenshot. It's a minimax, oh, okay. But, I don't know, I don't know if this is a good idea. If Biobak says this is unworkable, and Biobak has to be able to work on a model too, then we can't just use it. We need to brainstorm more, don't just fixate on the thing. Right now, we are exploring the space of possibilities and trying to get something that we can work with in the future that looks good. We can't just be like, oh, first thing that looks good, let's jump on it. Yeah, we're using an infmap. Right, there's tons of ice castles, surely we can find something else that might be a bit more workable. I don't get the issue. Well, I guess the issue here is making doors work well with that, and stuff. Something like this would be a lot easier. The problem is all the depth here is really difficult to do. Lila, stop! Really think borders, yeah, really think borders would work. We could try and go for something like this, where there is like ice around, and then there's darker spots and brighter spots, and we use that for some kind of depth effect. No, I don't, Adriano. My first Mario 64 memory was trying to wall kick by kicking the wall, and it didn't work, because Mario would just kick the wall and not wall kick. Why is there an pit in yours? Just because, I guess. This, this looks nice, yes, but getting a shader like this on the N64 is basically not possible. What do you mean, BMG Gamer? Not even a few minutes ago, you said my wife was in a bad spot for being with me. Add this? No, no, no, no, no, definitely not. Yeah, the transparent stuff just doesn't work. It's evil, Lila. What if Snow White from Majora's Mask? No. Oh, this one might not be so bad. Does it have to be an IGN video? Can I get literally anything else? Oh, this looks bad. Why does it look like a Majora's Mask 3D? Hi everyone, welcome back to my Let's Play. You apologized? Wait, so you didn't mean it? Why would you say that if you didn't mean it? Isn't it kind of stupid? Were you just trying to hurt my feelings? That's so funny. All right, Tenacious, if I do end up going with that idea, then that will be very helpful. Yeah, this doesn't look very good. This is pretty cool. What? This is not at all what I wanted. Well, I mean, I guess this room is kind of not terrible. Let me try to make a room like that. I like the bright snow effect, it still looks like a castle, I see. I have an old Project 64 version, which just doesn't come with the ad. The new versions are more accurate, but if I want accuracy, I'm just going to use my N64. What are you doing? I am 3D modeling. Okay, so my idea here, we have two materials and they're going to be kind of additive. And we're going to use that for bright and dark spots. So I want dark ice in some places and then a little bit of snow on it. So it should look like there's snow on top of the ice. I think that's a good vision. So we'll start with an icy texture, like something like this maybe. Actually, that looks terrible. Let me get a different one. Mario Odyssey has ice capes? Wait. Oh, right, of course, there's like a whole ice world in that game. Oh, is this a 2D image in the background? That looks so cheap. Oh God, this looks so stupid. That's not serious. What was Nintendo cooking? Oh, but this is nice. Wait, this has to be different. Texture zero alpha multiplied by shade color alpha, and then we have combined color alpha multiplied by shade color here. That's what I'll do. So something true. Let's see what feeling this gives me in game. If it was possible to release an ancient Mario 64, but could only be done via a secret method, how would you have made the secret attainable? You definitely have to use the mirror for that somehow. Maybe something like the pillars have to be ground pounded in an L-shape or something in the mirror room. We need bricks and shit yeah ideally we'd have bricks made out of ice this is the last quest 13 and there's gonna be 15 just like the original game dark blue instead of black yeah I was thinking mostly whites and dark blues here it looks like shit yeah I'm not a fan of this this texture is like barely visible too oh no lumpy what is lumpy lumps slumpy gravy covered with lumps lumps as a surface heavy or clumsy ice levels tend to look bad well hopefully this one doesn't that's why we are exploring options here yeah even the ice in Mario Odyssey looks bad look at how much this texture here is repeated god damn it I like this this looks cool but it's unworkable we actually removed the fog entirely so we can use the vertex alpha if you have fog you can't use vertex alpha I kind of need that for more options graphics wise check the snow kingdom king even this one doesn't really pop yeah maybe mario odyssey is not the reference we're looking for ice level mario galaxy mario galaxy it's wait wait wait that was the ice the shader that Biobak made that I wanted to take a look at again ah okay yeah that's that's a nice texture but not really applicable here I think this is kind of neat the way there's like an ice outline here all right xpm one thing that might work is um if we actually just add bricks that look like they're made out of ice with some bricks and it's like a multi-texture or something oh that's true Biobak I might have to fix that we could do something truly terrible Biobak's gonna hate this one but I think it's worth trying these objects are nice using because of the frost texture over them that's uh already what we did here that's yeah that is one of the ideas there we go how would this look if we just... actually just did this oh no oh yeah what did I do wrong? why was my time safe? Ace why? what's wrong? where's the caterpillar in your opinion? the caterpillar surely adds to it I mean I mean you have to admit there's a certain style to this one I don't like it but it has a certain flavor to it looks like a bathroom, it does resolution are you using? usually 64 by 64 toilet area, a big ice bathroom, it looks like that one wall 23313 no man can only bank like shadows you can't have the infinite differentiation stored yeah we couldn't bank shadows with uh relics alpha we skipped the fog but yeah I have another idea in the oven I'm not making this up and the idea would be to basically use this and make this into scales and then make this look very scaly but that would also look more like a mountain than a castle a reference pic I don't see the reference pic but kind of we're not looking for an ice cave at all in Nintendo for life we're trying to make an ice castle and I did like this one here this kind of style this was so far the best one but it's still it's like very unworkable to make something like that so we ended up not doing that the hexagon tiles here are kind of nice what if we theme the entire castle around hexagons hmm so this is last week and gave up on it oh oh right we had a beehive last time I forgot about that snow is allowed as a construction material I think so and what the fuck what's that why don't I why would I what kind of question is that because that's not the level we're making that the answer you're looking for is yes I really saw the sensation of isolation whereas the bricks and other designs didn't yeah I agree the pictures and related works did you see oh I did not let's see it's ice cubes we can't do transparent stuff unfortunately at least not easily is that's gonna be other kinds of poopy that might be real I think it might have to be ice spikes it could be ice spikes on curved walls or something it could be sparse ice spikes on top of like reflective ice I feel like if you have just a layer of ice and then ice spikes on top of that it might be a bit easier to work with the spikes from top and bottom and use the texture for the middle yeah that's that's also kind of a nice idea sounds like fuck so basically this I like the spikes at the top and bottom but it'll have to be much thicker spikes you think these are not thick enough they are pretty thick aren't they I guess this whole thing is 600 tries so that's kind of a lot yeah let me see what kind of texture we can put here first and then we see what we can do for that purpose so it's a blur into white so you don't use transparency these they blur into dark blue wait okay maybe I missed the message before the frosted oh layer colors on the multi-texture I see what you mean yeah that's um we had an experiment like that earlier actually and I think the textures I had for it were kind of bad though so so much details what you're worrying about interesting okay we can explore less detail in a second but let me let me try to make like a material here that you put underneath and then we'll see if we can reduce detail I mean we definitely can but you know so , the and  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Why is this so sudden? I don't like that this is so sudden. It makes no fucking sense. What am I doing today? We are trying to make this look good. Trying. Maybe the whole castle should just be like this. Absolutely looks like a fever dream. And the contrast is a little harsh, but I kind of like these vaults. The contrast needs to be less harsh, but other than that, I think it works. I do want to do an experiment with that idea, though. What is this going to look like? Okay, Miamic. So you like this genre idea? That's good. Yeah, the hue definitely has to change. Not how I had envisioned this. I like the idea, I hate the spikes. Just the way the spikes are? Makes sense. Hmm. Let's try a much lower value. Yeah, that makes sense, Miamic. If you have an idea for that, I'm absolutely up for it. You like the spikes, but you don't like the wall. Oh, I see your texture too, XPM. It's kind of an interesting material, but I feel like less bricks on one texture and higher resolution would look a lot better. I feel like this is going to give some people a bit of a headache. Yeah, Npen, I'm up for changing the texture. The ice block texture right now is just very temporary. I just kind of needed it to get a feel of the vibe. There definitely should be a room like this. With this effect here. You see the ghost thing on Mario? I think the ghosting effect looks really fucking cool. Yeah, I still live in Canada. The ice castle will be a full level, but we haven't even finished one room yet. We're working on making the art stuff where it looks good. Before we even try to make the level. Darken the texture. I want a different texture entirely. That texture was not ever going to make it into the game. Need something for the outside area as well. Bricks for the outside area? Or what are we talking about here? I'm going to make this opaque though, because not having this be opaque is going to be a big issue. For actually making this level very impractical to work with. That's why I only wanted for one room. Because if it's more than one room, it's going to be a shit show. Ah, that's true. Although for outside I'm less worried, because that's going to be a minor part of the level compared to the inner part. Yeah, you could have known that it was a temporary texture. This just looks like Ice Cave again. I don't want Ice Cave, I want Ice Wall. Are you doing professionally or is it already Twitch? I am a programmer. Professionally. My Twitch is currently not working. It's like barely profitable. I think on Twitch I make like 50 bucks a month. Not a good amount. It's not a cave, it's a castle. You can see further into the cave. It's not a cave, it's a castle. Yeah, that's going to be part of the intention. But before we do anything, we need to make sure that our actual pixels look nice. Before we add any detail. Do you work at a studio? Yeah, I work at Gears for Breakfast. I think we had this texture earlier. Disclaimer that all opinions that I share online are not the opinions of the studio I work for. Thank you, thank you. Yeah, basically Finity. Looks nice, but very saturated. That's true. I also don't like how bricky this looks. This doesn't look icy enough. It looks too bricky, you know. Oh, XPM just sent me a texture. Let's see how this works out. Oh, I like it. Junior buys the software. He has a rewards channel full of clips from his stream. So he says, dump shit on text. And he's basically all over everyone's feed. That's such an easy strategy. I never heard of that guy, actually. Okay. Let me actually experiment with this. Wait, why did you send me a JPEG? Can you send me this as a PNG as a JPEG? It's gonna be very... Oh, pirate software. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know that guy. He could definitely do that, too. Maybe. But then I would have to put efforts into making shots and stuff. I also didn't know that guy made games. I thought he just... has a Twitch talk show or something. Okay. Is the PNG bigger, though? You just have to clip the things you say? Oh. And because I already say stupid things all day, that would be like the most low effort way of getting famous. I see what you mean. Okay. Hmm. Okay, what's the stupid 180 million views?  Oh, right. Then I have to pull out the MS Paint. Shall we try it? Okay. Guys, I think I don't get baseball. Why would anyone play baseball? Look at this. You're on the field. Like, fucking... I guess this is what it looks like. And there's... How many guys are there in baseball? Like 15. There's like 15 guys standing here. But everyone that plays is just one guy standing here and one guy standing here. All these guys are just waiting half the time. What do you do when you play baseball? It's like watching someone else play most of the time. What a scam. Maybe I need to think my bits out a little more.  Baseball field is fun trio for optimisation.  Can we get some Bazel? Yeah, after one another. Only one person at a time. I think we can make this look a little more snow-covered. The problem is, if I do that, then how am I gonna do the top part? Tennis is stupid because you're waiting after them. Not true, actually. After you shoot the ball, you run back into the middle of the field. You're preparing for the next shot while you're not shooting yourself. Baseball was literally designed to be so slow and boring, that you can transmit it over the radio. That's the only reason baseball is popular. Because back when we had no TV and only radios, you were able to tell other people via radio what's going on in a baseball match. Review golf. Oh god, golf is just going on walks with your bros for people that are scared to ask their bros if they can go on walks with them, you know? It's like, fellas, is it gay to go on a walk with your friends? And you say, yes! That's why we play golf. There's my very inoffensive golf review. I don't think so, Sailor. I think he's just a very passionate individual. I think he just likes making songs. Yeah, I think this was not the right idea. I think it's better to just go with the CI4 here. Let's add a bit of brightness to this and then try to make this a CI4. I played baseball when I was young and somebody called me the n-word and then you quit? What? What a fucking wild story. I thought the story was gonna be like, I thought I was playing baseball as a kid, but then I realized I was just watching other people play baseball. But no, the fucking story went a completely different direction. This looks icy. There's the Ravens living in here. I think it's very safe for the S1, of course. I think this would have potential if we could make the crystal split better. Cool. Makes sense to exclude as long as it doesn't repeat. No idea what you're talking about. This is much of the ice peaks. Yeah, that's the one issue here. We have to think about something for the ice peaks. I would also kind of like if this just went into dark blue at the top. Like nothing else behind it. Just like if... Oh, that's the roof. Cry about it. You know what I mean? I don't know what I'm talking about.    Just like so. So not on the bottom, too. I always look like you are inside a big cylinder. Kind of.  With the artbrush sticking out, so I need an angle. Of course, that's doable. We can just cut out individual bricks. But first, we need the actual pixels to look nice before we add detail like that. The only way we can make this darker is if we also make the crystals darker like so. Which now the crystals are kind of just like black here. Oh, wait, they are not. But now the crystal... Oh, they still look like they saw my transition. Maybe it's not so bad then. We'll just make this brighter. What the fuck? That's not what I thought would happen. How is this possible? Oh, because we multiply the rims. How is this? We still have more purplish tones. The bricks have more greenish tone. Doesn't really match.  Yeah, kind of. Looks way better. Yeah, but now we're kind of missing the dark parts. I mean, it definitely looks mysterious. Yeah. We might just have to make the roof out of these crystals too. The performance doesn't really... This is still going to be 60fps, I'm pretty sure. Okay, well, the good news is Biobak said he had a good idea for this. And I'm slowly running out of ideas. I think I'm going to go back to programming my operating system on the N64. Which is just libultra, but better. So that will be the end for the stream for today. And I'll be working on libultra optimizations. So I'll see you guys next Saturday. Bye bye.
