Hello? Where is my stream at? Hello, Zayna? I'm not fully on camera. There we go. Hey, thanks for the 51 months. Let's go back to the overworld today. Simping wife. Cringe. Hello, Mustafa. Oh, yeah, we want the background trees here to actually fit the foreground at some point. But that's for later, I think. Back to the forest trees. No, we're probably gonna be done with this area in just a couple minutes. And then we're gonna move on to the next part. You should make this game for the 3DS. I have a 3DS. I don't have it anywhere. Please pour it. All right, buddy, just because you only have a 3DS, I will port this to 3DS just for you. Anything else? Shall I send you my money or something? Would you like my Pokemon card collection, too? Oh, this is what's going on. Okay, now it makes sense. Now it makes sense. He doesn't have enough forensics formulation. I don't know about that. What a generous man. Sure, I just love people so much that I'm willing to give them everything I own. No problem. I fucked this one up. This is very ugly. This is slightly less ugly. Can you put this game into Doom just for me, please? Do you only play games made in Doom? Anyway, any OST wishes for today? Because when I listen to any music... I've been working on a video about how Mario 64 can run on the Game Boy Advance today. So maybe we should listen to some Game Boy Advance music. Honestly, this one should just be split up here. Okay, can I get a Commodore 64 port? No. Providence for iPhone, I think, is the best at the moment. Jet Force Gemini. No, I want to listen to Game Boy Advance music. What is the most emblematic Game Boy Advance game you can think of? Like a game that you think of and you instantly like, yep, this is what the Game Boy Advance is all about. I want something like that. Superstar Saga. Is this a Game Boy Advance game? I will believe you that it is. Rhythm Heaven is what Game Boy Advance is about to you. For me, Game Boy Advance is Pokemon Leaf Green. Fire Emblem and Pokemon, fair enough. Ugh, wrong comments. Hello, Biobak. My personal favorite Mario 64 romhack? I still like Star Road a lot. As expected, updating Fast64 broke the overwatch. I think this is on a nightclub area today. If there's another stream before Friday, maybe we can see the rework. Okay, that might be on Tuesday. Okay, there's some pretty nasty issue with the decal there, holy shit. That is not good. Hello, Mustafa. Hello, Mustafa. Yeah, I think this area is getting somewhere. Not this week, then in two weeks. No! England is taking Biobak from us. It's too bad that he has to go to jail in England. Nice. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright, I think we're moving on to area three today, which is this. And what do I do with the giant banana man? Bro is going to be eating beans on toast for two weeks. This is the worst flickering I've ever seen. Holy hell. So I'm half thinking of maybe we should already set the warps for the areas here. So like, set the warp to area three. Problem is, man, what if a beta tester escapes the jail when they send them beta testing roms, and then they are able to just enter every level? That would suck. Might be controversial, but beans on toast is actually pretty decent. England has claimed this man. Oh, we actually should also be thinking about the water here. We need to do something for the water. We can't just leave it like this, I think. So this is not moving water. I always have difficulty making water that's not moving. Like, what do you even put on it? I'm also a bit worried about this section here. For the first overworld, isn't this a little bit awkward? It seems like a weird jump to request of players in the first overworld. I don't know. I guess they can go all the way around like idiots. But I think I should put something there. I'm not doing the waves thing on the whole island. Well, it doesn't make sense here. The waves thing would be here, yes. But in this contained lake, I think no. Definitely not. Oh, you weren't looking. That makes more sense. Waves. Waves on a still sea? Come on. That's not gonna look good. Oh, it should shimmer along the surface. Yeah, yeah. This food tastes good but looks awful. It's basically a PR problem. Now, I've had fish and chips before. See, I haven't had chips and fish until I was like 28. And I thought it was gonna be like awesome food. And then I ate it and it was like... Like you were just eating fried bread with like a little bit of fish in there, like as an excuse. And so it's like the opposite of the problem. Like it's the opposite of a PR problem. Like the PR was good, but the food was terrible, you know. Okay. Okay. It's good in England. Nothing exceptional, but it's nice. As in the food. Honestly, I think people overrate how much of a difference the country they live in makes in their day-to-day life. I feel basically no difference from living in Canada versus living in Germany. Except for the bureaucracy. Oh my god, dude. Can't deal with it. Fish and chips? Oh, I see. So you're doing Majora's Mask crossover and Banjo-Kazooie crossover on Minecraft 64? I am doing the Banjo-Kazooie crossover. That is still an ongoing project. It's just something I work on very slowly because it's not that interesting of a project. And I'm also working with someone else and we only meet once a week. But there is no Majora's Mask one in the works. Not quite sure why you think that I'm making one. I've been to Germany once and they had cured sausage for sale just hanging on the wall. But a lake texture. Why not have a reflecting texture of the sky cloud and the bridge shadow? Oh, I see. This might be important. I have to watch this real quick. Oh, this is a secret video. I can't show you guys. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. Living in Germany would be quite different for me because I wouldn't understand shit. Fair point. It's secret DMs. I'm sorry. It's a group chat where me and the boys are making fun of you. I didn't want to tell you but that is what's going on. Okay, we have to think about the texture for this part. So we could go with more of this type of rock. Probably have to loop around this once. Forest here should be fine. Oh, there's volcano again. So this needs to be volcanic rock. Oh, Blender has Python support, right? So you can basically do whatever you want in it. So we have this one loop around here. And then here i kind of want the zoo rock to appear and go till here actually the zoo rock can engulf this whole thing here i think up until here and then we can do an alpha phase we have a ton of bigger fish on this part of the beach i don't know what we do with it or where they're comparing to yes we could i mean big ass fruit is like a really easy way to like make something for the level so i think that's why i initially had the idea of big ass fruits because there's already like million ideas you can just use they are ready for you hello lynx what's the maximum amount of time i'm trying to get to the max i don't know it's been almost 10 years since i made that game bro okay so we get this until around here this one should also be this rock here i think we need the reason for them to be there though i agree i mean there's going to be a gigantic fruit on the super happy tree for sure so we could be like yeah these these grew from the super happy tree and we're placing them around the island to spread the happiness you know what i mean they fall from lofty lumber leaves hmm big food looking in the water yeah you know what saying that they grew from the super happy tree and that they're being spread over the island actually also gives us the opportunity to evolve the overworld over time again you mean just in this area you want big fruits lofty lumber leaves is all the way over here so dropping them specifically here is kind of not working for me at all i was gonna ask but i recently saw your comment in a jerk video about ranking mental disorder is it then true uh you mean j-req um that's a question that i will not answer they could bring the super happy tree mega fruits here like a storage beach hmm that kind of makes sense but also how did i get them here you know i think the fruit idea is just too stupid that maybe like maybe it just doesn't work our expectations for this game unrealistic i don't know what the expectation is if you expect this game to like cure your cancer then yes that is unrealistic if you expect this game to be like fun and maybe one of the most fun games you've ever played i would say that's pretty realistic i hope so will you add bleaching around the world maybe sun tanning on the beach or mini world objective i am not 100% certain on luigi yet because there is a chance we are still adding multiplayer to this so having luigi just sun tanning wouldn't be quite right with me so oh that's hard to see so i was just wondering but do you still work for gears for breakfast i do marty how come what's what's the question for so you expect this game to fix your marriage it's gonna be a tough one but maybe the game is so good that you and your wife can bond over playing it so so so you're just gonna have rolled the fruits over to the bench though maybe a banana would not work all right well the corridors are too tight and we can't make the corridors bigger because then the overworld is not going to be seamless anymore so impossible someone how are you doing german why why do you want to know yes think about it dude someone's just asking you how you're doing what did it what the fuck do you need to know that for what what could this possibly lead to this conversation like what are you trying to get out of me that that's what i think when you ask me what are you doing i'm asking i'm wondering like how does this pertain to the current situation like what problem do you solve by knowing how i'm doing you're asking because you're wondering if there's another hit coming well as you can imagine um whether like anything like that i wouldn't be allowed to tell you like i wouldn't even be allowed to tell you whether there's one or not  you ask me because you care Germans don't care you care how someone is doing and that's why you ask me how are you doing and that is the sound right now most people ask how are you doing it's like a hello god forbid people have empathy how is having how is it having empathy to ask how someone's doing the hell that's because i'm genuinely curious how you're doing why it's a genuine it's my genuine reaction why do you care i feel like there's some funny red coin background to do and cool visuals to do with floating fruits in the water you're right we could have a timed red coin mission here so well you see this area here something more like that we're just like a volcano rocky area with a volcano rock and then a normal rocky area with normal rock i mean i don't think it was true in some way but i'm not overthinking it you guys are under thinking it most social german no no no i'm not doing i'm doing terrible thank you for asking you guys how are you feeling today if i want to ask any question like that you sound like a therapist dude can we help you feel better in any way yes you can donate money i would love money hello mr game and watch fan did you make a mario hack like this do it's not a bad day at all i just questioned why anyone would want to know how my day is going you know he's supposed to be every three years but all of the island and giant fruit is grown from them or the tree just shoots fruit out of the island different spot again well my bike was saying that the fruits would all be in this area and i i mean i agree it would be very cool to have just a super fruity area here this could be the fruit fruit beach you know this could be the famous fruit beach location when yoshi's love hanging out and maybe there's a time red coin mission or something this is where it is beeps you can do grape platforming exactly or um wait let me think of a different pun i cannot think of one oh i see game and watch i see i see okay i'm not a fan of tacos can we all talk about how burgers get the bad repetition because fast food places fuck up burgers all the time and by bad repetition i mean they get the repetition from being unhealthy think about that man it's fucking meat salad and bread how is that unhealthy so you guys mean something else with tango sweet tacos to a french person is insane see the fries and soda dude this actually pisses me off there's this one place we go to they have two things i like doner and chicken burger the doner is way too little and way too spicy and the chicken burger is like 90 fries i'm like oh i would like a burger and it doesn't even say anything about fries on the fucking thing and then you order the thing and you get like a huge plate of fries with one little burger it's like i didn't order fries i ordered the fucking burger where's my burger so i'm an unpopular opinion machine i turn uh opening my eyes into unpopular opinions anyway let's think about a way we can justify this being the fruit bae that's actually the thing i miss the most about living in germany doner kebab canada has doner which is like doner but like bad they take out all the salad and just put sharp sauce into it and onions and tomato but none of the other salad sucks how much is doner in germany when i lived in bremen it was three euros 50 for a small one four euros 50 for a big one this was 2018 so if you're ever in germany around louisita i think that's where i lived go to the doner man it's right next to the student homes he makes very good doner it's like yeah i mean inflation fucked the doner prices okay why is this the fruit bae does this need to have lore what if we just say the yoshis carry all the fruit here like fuck it i guess they can go around the island  we can add strawberry apple orange grape and then maybe later you get another fruit that spawns here and allows you to go up here or ship and it all washed up when it's with intentions you know she's naturally lofted that's not lore players whatever like want to read yeah we can just say they carry the stuff here like maybe there's one yoshi that just drops that and you would only get that lore if you actually seek it out okay so banana what are what are fruits that you eat in yoshi's story shit is fruit and it's never explained i think yeah honey melon too there are seven types of fruit yoshi can eat melon i forgot to write down melon bananas apples watermelons grapes peppers what does the pepper do in yoshi's story does it make you go fast so what i'm thinking here is um maybe after i like i'm done with this i'm gonna go back to you get a hundred stars people are like oh you restored so much happiness to the island the the thing dropped another fruit and then next time you enter this area there's like a different fruit here that you can use to get a secret star i'm thinking the way it would work is we put a bunch of fruits here and then there's like a switch you press the switch and eight red coins spawn you have to the eight red coins within a time limit if you manage to do it you get a star and you can only reach the switch by jumping on the fruit that spawned at like a hundred stars or whatever that must cause damage oh i see not if it's like a very visually imposing fruit i believe i think we can pull this off so so so Would Clash with the Ice Cap? Would it? Can we reuse the pick your power up route here? Oh, I see. That would clash with the Ice Cap. Yeah, yeah. That would be very good. Also, we can't do that in the overworld. It gives you too much freedom and it breaks a lot of the illusions we use in the overworld. Hello Samuel. Pepper eating competition? A pepper eating competition would be very funny. I'm going to write that down as like a possible event for the overworld. Um, maybe pepper eating competition, maybe that. Hello Lila. Lila, I haven't been able to figure out the bug yet in course five. I will tell you when I find it out. Swimming in shit yellow, maybe I have bad eyesight. Bananas start green and then they turn yellow over time. It would be very funny if the bananas slowly disintegrated while you were playing the game, just because that's what bananas do. Are you sure it's not a you thing? I'm fairly certain it's not a me thing. I updated and the zoo started working and the decals are fixed. So you have to promise on the food like the ingredients in the pot from Halloween Mayhem. Of course. Some rolls, some bounce, some sink. I see what you mean. So there is the egg physics we have that kind of works like Mario Galaxy's rolling ball. We could have that with like the orange. You got to change the else. I removed all code from the level. Grapes would be bouncy. Let me look at the grapes. Oh, these things, yeah, they're bouncy for sure. So would that be part of the platforming challenge? I really do like the idea of a timed in Red Coins challenge on fruits that have different properties. It could even be like a fruit in the water that rotates the way you're on it. You know how those rolling blocks work. But turn this whole thing into a huge playground. But maybe the challenge should be available from the get go instead of you having to unlock it. Oh, I see. Fruit in the water. I thought you meant on land. So on land, I think it's a little too much restrictions that come with us design wise for what we can do in the overworld. I imagine someone jumping on a fruit and then rolling all the way back here and it's going to be all weird. We still have to add power to this. Okay, in that case, why don't we think about where the Red Coins switch goes that starts the challenge. Do we add a timer to this? I think we should add a timer to this. Hmm... Thief Gaming Music. I'm kinda sad I didn't have time to make another Thief Gaming video for this year's April Fools. People loved the last one for some reason. It was made purposefully shitty and it did so well. Oh, actually. Did you guys see that we were all over the news recently? Spamers, Mark hides a secret fuzzy to play for 14 months. One. What else? Two articles about it. Three. Four. Five. Six. How is my stupid debug more relevant than Mario Kart 64 CD compilation being finished? This is so stupid. There has to be some kind of conspiracy going on here. You saw me on Reddit? No fucking way, dude. What were they saying? You saw me on the bed sleeping? Please do not watch me in my sleep. Yes, the Mario Kart PC is done. And you had no idea because they were not reporting on it. People don't care about the decompilation but they like a funny bug. You don't think they would care about the Mario Kart decompilation? But they would care about the menu breaking after two and a half years? I don't know about that. That sounds insane to me. Anyway, let's rip some good models. This one is kind of nice. It probably just works. Okay, but if instead of decompilation you set the PC port around the corner, instantly everyone cares.  Oh, that's a beautiful apple. Oh, I love this apple. You want Fast64 to focus on that? I don't want Fast64 to focus on that. I want Fast64 to focus on fixing the bugs that make Mario 64 hard to work with right now. And please give me export indices. Please. I'm running into so many issues because I don't have it. You said it would be easy to have. Give it to me. I am begging. I am begging. Export indices. Like the labels. Where it's like, this is the label for this material's primitive color comment. When are you told that being able to Mario 64 on an emulator makes it a PC port? No way! We're not giving you the hacky thing for your two nanoseconds. It really isn't two nanoseconds. It's also about backwards compatibility and all that. But I really, really do need it. Or I need to implement the custom solution in code. I don't know if you understand how that works. I don't know how big a deal this is. Is this a jump deal? Give me that. No, that's not what it is. The proposed solution makes absolutely no sense. Anyway, it sounds like I need to accept that I just need to implement this in code myself. Okay. Why is the UV here so weird looking? It should be fine in game though, right? That's way better. Instantly. Okay. How are you not modifying the actual DL Lilaa with your jump commands? You heard me Lilaa. How is doing a jump command and then modifying the data at the jump command not the same as modifying the display list? Yeah. I know. That is God's suggestion. Saying it makes no sense to me. Is that something else? No. What do you mean? You said a jump command. A jump command to a different thing makes a different thing part of the display list. Just because you add an extra jump command and then a jump back command doesn't make it not part of the display list. All you did is add two jump commands. I should have been not fucking with the original display list. You are fucking with the original display list. The jump commands are making the data you jump to part of the original display list. It's like you asking me not to sleep with your mom. So what you do is you send me to a different room and then make me sleep with your mom. It's like what's the point? All you did was make us waste some time. Yes, I'm the king of analogies. That's exactly what it's like. See, he gets it. It's also gonna waste some memory. But you get why I don't want that Lilaa, right? Like, you get how to me that sounds completely insane. What is going on here? Okay, so since we're doing fruit now, instead of having to chase the penguin, you get a free chain jump that eats a big fruit in front of the level entrance. Wait, what do you mean instead of chasing the penguin? You're still gonna need to do that to get the level entrance. Where is this instead coming from? Oh, there we go. That's way better. I still don't like having props that you jump to. That doesn't use up everything freely. Just jump and then use it. I don't see how the second part is related to the first. You could mark properties as dynamic, and then when they're marked dynamic, you export the labels and they don't bleed. Or you could mark them as dynamic, and then when they're marked as dynamic, you have different things to jump to, like the different property or the whole thing. I don't know. Stuff being marked as dynamic does seem unrelated to everything else here. No labels, stop. Labels are literally just your idea about beta. And I am going to have to implement that in code. So what I'm going to do is look at my text items function here. Get the case 39. So what I'm gonna have to do is... Oh, this one doesn't actually implement it. Oh, does it? Huh? Where's the sine wave handle? Oh, the sine wave is handled in Geo. Let me give you an example. Here, the scroll material. That's a good example. So what I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to take a pointer to this material display list. And then I'm gonna have to define a bitmask and iterate this display list until the display list comment matches the bitmask. And then store a pointer to the first display list comment that matches the bitmask somewhere. And then retrieve that pointer later. I think that's the only solution around it. And then that way I don't have to waste time on the jumps. And I can make this just work. I just hope that you allow an option not to use the stupid jumps. I don't know why you're so insisting on the jumps. Honestly, this just seems insanely cringe to me. What did you miss? Not much. We were just planning the third part of the overworld. Oh, what a beautiful strawberry. No, I don't want the Donkey Kong 64 sound for no reason. Anyone else feel like strawberries would fly with a propeller? Do we have flying strawberries in this area? Lila, you are touching the display list. You can't just say no touching the display list and then touch the display list and call me stupid. I'm pretty sure HoA-T works more like the GeoASM comments. Which, if you wanted to do that, that would be still wasteful, but at least that would be a sane approach. I'm just going to use the segments. Are you sure they're not like... That doesn't mean anything. No, I don't believe you. I don't believe you. Prove it. No strawberry in the N64 model section? Nope, I don't think so. This is a nice strawberry. This one's way too high-res. We might have to use this and remove the shadows somehow. Yeah, I have done Ocarina of Time modding, Lila, and from my experience it doesn't do that. I believe it is just like GeoASM's. And sure, there is GeoSegment comments, or DisplayListSegment comments, but that has nothing to do with the rest of this. That's like saying Mario64 renders vertices. By using addition comments like yeah sure there's addition comments somewhere in there but that's not like the thing that makes it work but there's a bit in female spots even though she is biologically male I don't know and yeah Lilaa you have no idea what you're talking about that's the problem I cannot help you I do not want this conversation anymore I'm just going to implement this my way I notice it's a lost cause strawberry and that's all we get this is the texture oh boy once you have bleeds and stuff or enough time loads from a segment just bleeds and stuff we're gonna okay so do you have every possible value that this property could possibly have preset in the segment and then you jump into the segment or what are you telling me are you telling me the CPU edits the thing in the segment and then you jump to the segment and like every tick you change the segment because that's exactly what Mario 64 is doing except it's that of segment they use second zero this is gonna look ugly hmm we might just have to make our own strawberry it shouldn't be that difficult yeah this this is also like a very inefficient strawberry let's google strawberry and we make it from there no it's not Lilaa I don't know what you're not getting if you just spoke normal language and like try to explain yourself I might be able to get it what you I might be able to decipher what you're trying to tell me but you're not really telling me anything that makes any sense this is very strawberry shape to me maybe a little more and then how many petals that I have like 16 I think that's too many okay Lilaa maybe just take a step back and tell me the exact steps that you will do to achieve your thing because I'm not sure I don't think you've explained it yet and I might have been assuming the way you want to do it so by you explaining the steps you want to take to make sure this works I can explain to you exactly where I don't like this this might be an easier way or I could explain to you how it's exactly the same thing mark 64 does if that's what it turns out to be I just said for six and so far you didn't miss much and mark from has a cool dynamic rock fuzzy robot export it jumped in this playlist into a segment in place of the prop bleed could account for the dynamic prop in the previous function in German this rings with your prop and the second point to it so in the same in which you just think separate and assume in the L okay so are you editing this property on the CPU at runtime how is this property changing because this is an animated property right it has to change so there's for sure at least one step you missed and explaining that and I'm trying to figure out what that is okay I think I can create a matrix in this one is deep what do you mean you are creating it how does creating this make any sense here so now explain doesn't know you're missing steps you can't just create it and then expect your displaced already be pointed to it it is released can't possibly know what you just created you're missing steps here so far your idea is not going to work you're pointing to a segment it's static and now nothing's happening so I how does pointing to a static point in a segment make any sense you're pointing to the displace you created so you're writing a pointer to your this playlist that is already there in order to avoid writing to this list no that's not what our green of time does they are it can't be because it doesn't work and it works in a green of time okay we're writing this up let's open paste then I'm gonna write down everything you just told me and then I'm then we're gonna look at this again so one mark property 64 to instead of the property there is a jump display this comment to a different segment we create what did you say let's say we create in this playlist that sets the property now what this is not being pointed to Lilaa how do we fix this it's didn't prop saying a this didn't prop actually the L gems to whatever's at sex 7 okay so what you're doing is you are pushing it this playlist that sets the segment pointer at runtime no Lilaa you didn't say that you need to say the words of what you want to do you can't just let me assume it okay so we have to die we create or we push this playlist that sets a segment at runtime so this is exactly the same as a GSM this is the same as a GSM how's it different the only difference is that now you are pushing extra jumps here what do you mean you give up I was not just japping I'm literally just explaining to you why what you're doing is exactly what Mario 64 already does you're just doing it in the worst way the GSM you need a note for each material yes I guess this has the advantage that you can copy the I guess you can create a whole display list that is a bunch of like set comments and return comments if you're okay with writing out the whole display list this is 64 agnostic now you need to write the code somewhere and need to push it somewhere and that has to be Mario 64 specific not the same and we can be aware of it if you are writing a custom geo is and then yes we can be aware of it but we are talking about an implementation for bleeds that you are making here so you would make it aware of the dynamic properties the same thing from the same dismissed in any game in the manifest but that can be done with a template or a hacker people yeah you would need to copy the same logic to everything I mean I'll give you that this has the advantage of a writing to display list that this is you can't rewriting to it halfway across a VI and ruin the outputs by one half of it being a frame apart ahead of the other half so that's good that's like I like that part but overall this isn't that different from the GSM I mean in a way you have to implement this via GSM because if you have actors with dynamic properties they also need to push it so this is basically GSM you put that the very start of an actor no Lilaa you were not explaining anything I asked you so many times I give you like four different implementation possibilities of how you could have tried to implement this and instead of saying yes I did this or we kind of did it like this but with this difference you just said no you're stupid yeah it has to be per actor it has to be a JASM at the start of each actor because of the segment thing it's gonna be interesting when you come by 8th row like I'm pointing to the exported displays instead of the generated display list talking about pointing to the exported displays instead of the generated display list not sure what you mean by that oh yes at first it sounded like what you wanted to do was you have this the same you have this the same and then you have like a step three where you have like a display list with all the properties that is statically pointed to and then you want the end-user to edit the properties in this pointed to display list which that would have been absolute nonsense and I explained that to you and you didn't say oh no we actually dynamically generate this at runtime you could have just said that hello lethargy ghost I am glad you could make it through but yes that is the same approach that I actually do not hate what a productive conversation yes you could have just talked like a normal person well no one's had the magic words to make it work which was that the segment would be dynamically generated I'm pretty sure I offered the explanation to her like oh so you mean like a GeoASM and then I was told no yes Nina I still cannot guess what you're thinking just based off of experience I think we can reuse this texture for the stem if we do something like this and then I like big strawberries big strawberries are awesome but I don't like the small ones okay this is actually also one of my favorite debates what about fruit and cake I think fruit ruins every cake it's in cake is for chocolate fruit is good too but it's not cakey you know what if this one was a good personality I wouldn't know besides if they had good personality I wouldn't want to eat them by the story has snow it's a snow Mary I never had a good freezing and that's true I don't even know what that is guys there's a barbershop near me and their logo is AI generated it's instead of barber it says like Baru bra or something it's a completely fucked up is it unethical to support my local business in this case but before you answer mind you this person is like 60 years old I know I already told you this I'm asking whether it's ethical to support my local business no it's just a 60-year-old woman I don't think they want to harvest my kidneys a fast-food joint with an AI generate menu make sure they don't put glue in the pizza I hope you all get that then reference of the glue on pizza hey I answer on Google the six-year-old should have educated herself about the ethical issue stemming from a I use death penalty it was supporting a local business yes because the local business is a 60-year-old woman who also used AI to generate her logo what's the crock I'm being obsessed with by genocide in South Africa by the way I don't know it's currently a favorite right-wing talking point I think I'm doing a chat that an AI driven through and it told me they were sold out of the doughnuts what the fuck maybe she wasn't 60 maybe she was like 45 but she was old that's the point seen for night a I definitely that it showed up on my Twitter homepage when I logged in but I wasn't interested enough to click on it friendly it's a fortnight AI that calls people slurs or something is how to wait let me let me work this correctly so a eyes I trained on user input and the worst thing that could possibly happen to an AI is to be trained on slurs so then is it ethical only if you're talking to this AI and training this AI to use slurs maybe maybe just the ones that refer to yourself just to make sure they cannot use that AI how close are you to partner I don't think I'm getting parted on twitch you can use a few Lilaa interesting please do not tell us which ones they send an address to TVT voice mode as a dog with NPC in the game how I see and that one uses slurs that is very surprising kiss Lilaa if you start then the next person is gonna do it and the next person is not going to be allowed to say those I'm sure only that it was her who generated it and not some lazy guy that did it and then asked his men to make it physical and put it up for her honestly that could be true oh I see it's just like people are jailbreaking the fortnight yeah can you imagine Darth Vader like telling you how to program hello world I like this texture do you think meowing will increase my mastery of the force very well then meow okay I see that's funny god I'm so glad I don't like any Disney stuff can you imagine like me as like a Disney adult I would be so cold Disney bought a lot of shit and killed it should make you think why they are interested in killing franchises you are a Mario adult no I'm not a Mario adult I hate Mario I hate video games I couldn't be a Mario adult it's actually a horrifying part though that like you could be considered a Nintendo adult there we go it's so good Mario and drink cola and keep you can see by the son of Nintendo that actually does psychic damage to me in the idea of fanboying a company is awful to where do you keep your Funko pop I mean amoeba collection I don't have a single amoeba let's go I'm safe are you supposed to eat the strawberry most digital strawberries cannot be eaten it is a limitation of the medium oh no I showed that guy to Zayna like yesterday I love that guy he is so funny should model the seats this will never run on n64 when you have all the internet exploring the taskbar internet explorer reveal at 100 twitch subscribers how long is this song 15 minutes okay we need to know who's team anyone else got some iconic in Gameboy games whose OST we would like to listen to well they'd that's on the Gameboy it is I haven't played a Metroid game yet which one should I play if I ever play them should I play one by everything you know about me does it make sense for me to play one Prime Force let's google that what the fuck oh I see wait this is the one with the multiplayer modes at the DS download game 115 triangle strawberry honestly this is pretty banger I wonder if multiple ones because they're so low poly I'm gonna store the one here it's the one everyone hates oh so you tried to make me play a poopy game unbelievable imagine I went through my life thinking that's the best Metroid game and then that's the one everyone hates so what my preferences are I like playing games that are like unique experiences I like some really stupid games like I played Mario where recently I like that one a lot maybe that's not a very stupid game but what about like Doshin the Giant I feel like Doshin the Giant is a game that would almost be universally hated but I liked it RepliCube RepliCube What the fuck? Is this a game? I see So you're just programming a cube? I think I would hate this Not because the game idea is bad, but because I'm already a programmer for work So I would play this and be like, this is A lot of people don't appreciate good games Well, I mean of course, there's many people that don't like video games This is fine if there's like a way to get on them And then we can have the red coins here Do I actually get money for prime subs? I do! I think every time you prime subscribe I get like 250 They're so ugly because they don't have the vertex colors here It's gonna look a lot better The texture? Yeah, it's a little rough Probably very improvable by the two cycle material This one's pretty nice though Wow that's possible? I don't like that at all Oh, I see, it's inverted, that's why Did you know Unreal Engine only has a double sided collision?  Yeah, greyscale would probably work But it's fine for now Am I trying to get this perfect? Honeymelon! How do you subscribe to my OnlyFans? I don't know whose OnlyFans you subscribe to, but I don't think that's me I think you have unknowingly been jerking off to a stranger You must feel so taken advantage of right now I'm sorry you had to go through that Kind of buff? Yep It's not really a secret Most people that come to my stream realize that I am somewhat built It's honestly really easy to be like a little bit built like I am You really just need to work out semi-consistently I mean I do work out pretty consistently But you don't even need to work out much And just get up once an hour and do a set That's all that's needed to get some decent muscle on you Keeps you mentally focused as well Okay Melon We need a watermelon and like a honeymelon Being an OnlyFans-owning post-office news journalist, do you think Nintendo could cover your stream debt? And more importantly, do you think they would pay for it? Fucking guys, that's just something I note Maybe they would look for the Kei's Emmanuel OnlyFans leaks That'd actually be so funny though You know, it would actually be even funnier if I hit the Yoshi renders between pictures of my dong And then if they strike me, we know there was like one Japanese guy going for like a million dong pictures to like find it That should be possible, Bruno But yeah, actually there isn't really much reason to say it's not possible There's probably going to be a decal model on top of Mario at some point That would allow for stuff like that What is your Gargadrino like? I really have to lose my guts I just do push-pull-like basically So, bench, pull-ups, squat, that, are just like the main stuff Some curls, some triceps pushed down Was some part of Nintendo's annual budget dedicated for paying for instance a Kei's dong? True I think that's a great So, you don't think my plan of posting dong pictures and Yoshi renders on OnlyFans is a good one? Alright, I will reconsider in that case Maybe we don't do that Thank you for the warning How do we make this texture not look awful when upscaled? It wasn't obvious Oh my god, if that's not obvious, then you must think I'm an absolute crazy person We shouldn't be using this texture We should just be using a hexagonal pattern and then vertex colors Which in the angle zone Nintendo copyright strikes from Hacker's OnlyFans That's true The articles would go Oh, crazy. Hmm... Where did I store my hexagonal path on? I had one somewhere. That's not it. It was very messed up looking, and it was very hard to find. But I know it's in here somewhere. Shit. Maybe it isn't special to the art? Maybe I need to post anything? I don't think that's required at all. Oh, this is a hex pattern, but it's not the right one. Dude, people would feel so scammed if you made an OnlyFans and then didn't post, like, cock pictures. This is what I wanted, I think. The first thing I hear when I get back is Nintendo and OnlyFans. We like to have fun in this chat. Yeah, what was that? Thank you for the subscription. Welcome back. This is a nice hex tile. I don't think Twitter would still say that. Ugh. This is what I want. Hmm... Twitter bots are like this now? What the fuck? I think we're almost to the exact same level as we did just before. Crazy. Okay. This time we have practice and we're doing it a little more intelligently. This doesn't feel very straight. Can I straight the middle? I can. Oh, that's cool. Okay. Hmm... I'm just doing this one first for no particular reason. Ugh. Okay. Okay. What happened here? Something's really wrong here. What the hell? Huh? Are you seeing that? Wait. Hey! Okay. Okay, okay. Different approach. One, two, three, four, five. What the hell am I doing wrong? Okay. I keep trying to save because I'm... I don't know why. How did I fuck this up so bad? Huh? I honestly do not understand how I fucked this up so bad. This should have been perfectly fine. Okay. Let's look at these here in detail. That seems fine to me. I think I need a clearer hexagon pattern. Okay. I think I need to pre-render this. This isn't gonna work. The hexagon pattern, I mean. Okay. Okay. So if we just take the middle part here, that should be fine, right? We only really need a couple. Okay. So if I take this and I just mirror it twice, that should be fine, right? That's all I need? Thinking about it? Yes. Well, I think it's gonna be easier for me to do it from here. It is screenshot time. I'm fine approximating this. It is a fruit after all. And fruit is organic. Okay. And organics are not perfect hexagons. Okay. Let's get rid of these two for a second. Just so we have a clear view. Okay. So there's clearly something wrong here. Let's start at the seam. That makes it easier for us to tell. So this seems like it should be longer. Yo, it's the song from Super Smash Bros. Melee. I just realized. We're only caring about the top two right now. Okay. This feels unfair. Hmm. Okay, that makes more sense. Hello, B-Turk. Okay, now the top layer looks okay. Oh, also there is these going up and down. Yeah, that's way better. Okay. Man, on one hand, this is the type of task where I wish AI could automate this. On the other hand, if you made an AI automate this and AI ever gained sentience, then the AI would probably kill you for making it do this for you. Okay. Okay. Wait, did I mess this up? I did. Okay, let's do it again. Huh? Okay. Okay, that looks like it works. Blood just maps hexagons on a sphere to rule. That is what blood is doing right now. But now what's this next step? You will not believe your eyes. As all of a sudden it will start looking good. One second, it's gonna start looking good. Okay. Okay.  How's that for my honey melon? Wait, the Eurovision Song Contest is today? Oh, I missed it. It's right now, I wanted to watch it just for once Pretty good, I guess well, that's all after all my suffering all I get is a pretty good I guess Such is the life of an artist Little paler, paler would be very easy to do But I don't know if it really looks any paler I think this is a lot more defined than Yoshi's Island, so we can do that I think that looks pretty nice Caught in Georgia and the Vance Maloney Is this... You talking about Giorgio Armani? This texture is 64x64 Talking about Giorgio Armani I have to imagine you're talking about Giorgio Armani That's the only context I can put to that Hello, silly babam I wonder if this can ever look good Bro, what the fuck How are they always connected? I don't think there's anything I can do for this It just is doomed But why do two of them look fine? Okay, now, you know what we can do to make this even better? Maybe this will look good, maybe this will look awful This one definitely looks awful I can give it a little few specks, like so To make it seem more Maloney, maybe Is there anything that looks like a melon texture? Hairy melon Is this any decent, what do you think? No, I just need the handlebar Can't lay the surface of a sphere flat Is there still a flat surface? Make the pattern and render so we get more depth Oh, I see what you mean Like, something like so, and then you have lighting in there Something like that Seems reasonable Yeah, I think that would look very good Okay Okay I think I'm just going to make this a simple material, like shape color is what you get Okay Alright, I think I'm happy with our honey melon here, except for the handlebar should be a bit bigger There we go It's a reason they are so big They grow on the super happy tree, and the super happy tree is where the island gets its power So it is a very very powerful tree, you have to know And after they're done growing there, on the super happy tree, the Yoshi's just roll them over here You remember the tracer background glitch thing to make a cool tree room, like maze of mirrors type stuff? Yes! There is one room like that in course 13 It is indeed very cool So this is going to be a moving actor, it's going to roll the way that you stand on it So that hopefully will look very cool We'll need a few more fruits here This fruit is so much higher quality than the others, because it's the only one I made Can you push them? This one will rotate the way you are standing on it, these are not pushable Not sure if there is going to be a pushable one Honey melons are huge, well maybe I should make these smaller then There is a problem if it's too huge, because how am I going to rotate it without it clipping into the floor Grapes, definitely grapes are going to be trampolines, we can do some cool vertex animations with those But to be honest, for today I am feeling pretty done So I will see you guys in the next stream, which might be tomorrow Although tomorrow I am going out to eat, so I don't know if I have time But I will do my best So until then, bye bye!
