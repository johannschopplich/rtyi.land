Hello. Hello. Who's in my chat today? Hello, hello. Let me make sure I'm on the right YouTube stream today. I am. Nice. That's the first big step done. Oh, shit. Wait one second. One second. I'm going to make sure I don't show anything bad here. Okay, there we go. Zaina is in my chat today. Hello. It's my second favorite Pablo. Might need to put the camera down a little bit. There we go. Oh, my God, I have so much definition today. Old error screen from 2000. What? What are you talking about? Okay. I'm going to make sure I don't show anything bad here.   Okay. Any OST wishes we have for today? Let's see. What was I working on? I was working on a bunch of small bug fixes. And on importing Soren's trace. But that's not important yet. Don't make any progress on this. Last thing we did was these guys here. Yeah. Did he come racing? All right, Liliana. Hello, Skyloft. Oh, no, it's going to end with the band messes up again. My nightmare. I believe we were working on making all the enemies work. Nice, Dax. Thank you, Biomech. Did you guys like the N64 test I did today? It ran a lot better than I thought it would. It ran near perfect without even optimizing anything. It's not optimized at all yet, so of course we're going to optimize it a little more. Hello, Lila. I was working on programming the enable NA option, too, right now. I have a bunch of time off from work, so I'm going to work on a bunch of features that I have put off for a long time. Once Soren's trace is in, it's going to be a lot easier to program. It's going to make optimization so much easier, actually. We'll probably find so many stupid things going on in the game that will give us huge boosts. WhatsApp case? Nope, nothing on WhatsApp. You didn't know that Western World was course 12 and not 11? What are you missing? Let's see. I see your comment here. You listed Bunny Brushwoods, All-In-One Bubble Dome, Rainbow Grotto, Cool Guy Galleon. You're missing... No, Cool Guy Galleon, Divine Dino Domain, Koopa Leaf Cove, Oily Boily Bay, World's Wildest World, Koopa Carnival, Lofty Lumber Leaps, and this one. What are you missing? Jurassic Jungle? Cool Guy Galleon was a strange name. It's not perfectly fitting, but I mean, Cool Guy kind of fits for the ghosts, and it's kind of like a galleon. Big snowman enemies that roll their head at you. Right. So I was thinking of making snowmen like this. There's going to be kind of like two balls here. And they're going to look at you like this, and then they're going to roll their head at you. It's going to go whoop. And then this one here is going to rotate 180 degrees and go up and shrink. And another one appears here. Makes sense. Cool Guy is good if you know it's a Shy Guy joke, but otherwise who is this guy and why does he have a galleon? You don't think Cool Guy would work? They got two faces, I guess. Although one face is going to be invisible, so you wouldn't really be able to tell, right? Yeah, I kind of just made this look like the original Snowman Lila. I didn't model anything here other than that. Of course. Classic. Yes, this is a 3D Mr. Blizzard. Yeah, but it's like course 8 or 9. It's no longer course 2. Arthur broke your heart? Wait, what have you guys done? Upgraded from cockroach to raccoon. Why don't you just keep him billboarded because it doesn't look good when they're so big. Okay, back to this. So you think having a second face is problematic? Which is fair, but if we don't have a second face, how is this going to work animation-wise? I kind of need them to roll the head on Mario. We could have the face come out of the body, like when the thing goes up. I'm imagining like this. What do you think about that? Or we could just add an alpha to it, yeah? Which one do you think would be better? Honestly, I kind of like this more. Let's do this. Wow, Leela, that's so depressing. You know what Zayna calls raccoons, Leela? She calls them trash pandas. Maybe you can take pride in being a panda. Why didn't you update it, Leela? Okay, we got this. Oh yeah, I made a new test overworld, by the way. The official RTY overworld is reduced to nothing again. So now when we exit the level we just get to the test overworld, but this is important for testing. Now we can test all the levels whenever we want. And some of the levels look truly fucked up. Like the camera here, I don't like it at all. And then the lava doesn't have the render distance. Dude, but the movement here is so good. This is like my favorite level to just run through. Well, nevermind. Did I tell you about my idea for a second star in there with rising lava? Or did I dream that? I think you dreamt that because I've never heard of that idea. But if we add a second star in this boza level, we need to add two stars in every boza level. Here we use the camera-based lighting as well as everything in the game vertex cutout. Camera-based lighting does exist on Mario. It's just very hard to see because I made it very subtle because I don't want it to be a strong effect. Okay, where are we testing the snowman? We need kind of a big space for that. Yeah, that's true. I'm just saying it's gonna result in consequences. There will be consequences. Fucked up that the raccoon would just throw their own baby in the trash. I have always meant to ask this, but why does your debug walkroom have pipes you need to walk to and jump in rather than being in the menu or having a compiler flag that autosponses you into stages? I have a compiler flag that autosponses me into a stage, which is nicer to be able to access everything without having to change stuff. Everyone look at this. It's a baby raccoon. You know what raccoons are called in German? They're called washing bears. Because they wash their food. You ever see a raccoon eat cotton candy and then he puts it in the water and it just disappears? Those are two without the Yoshi. I mean, we could make that playable, but do we want to? Small washer raccoons. It's funny, I feel like people have started taking raccoons as pets a lot more often. Even rats are being taken as pets nowadays. Rats have been rats for a long time. I think rats have a pretty, pretty bad... What's the word? Reputation. Reputation. Because they bring so many diseases. What about snakes? Actually, yeah, that's fucked up. People have snakes as pets? Snakes are like the one pet I cannot agree with. A snake is not a social animal. It's not gonna like you. It literally just does not have the facility to like someone. Oh my god, I'm so sorry Lila. Weddings are the worst. Oh, don't worry Lila. No one at the wedding is happy. They're all just pissed that they have to sit there. And be hungry because there's no food being served. Yeah, the icon is still pretty notable, Kazini. It's still like almost double the FPS. Next person to invite me to a wedding. It's like, I don't know. I'm punishing them somehow. Where do I hide the tupperware? In my suit? Do I just fill all the suit pockets I have with like beans and stuff? No? Yes. Dude, a while back. That's the fucked up thing. The last wedding I went to, the only food they really had was fucking beans and salami. Just like thin slices of salami. They said food was gonna be served at like 5.30. It was 7. They hadn't served food yet. I went back to the buffet and I just fucking started eating beans and slices of salami. And then when they did serve the food, it was like maybe like a third of a serving for me. And you know what? Then they served the cake. You know what the cake was? Do you want to know what the fucking cake was? It was a slice of toast with cream on it. And I think there was a strawberry on it too. Like this cream. This is what they put on a slice of bread. And that was their wedding cake. Cheap ass wedding. Yeah. What's the worst? Carbonated pizza. Beans are fine. Yeah, but not if that's the only food you get. Of a tea wedding? I guess so. But they weren't even poor. They had a huge house with a pool on it. Hello Ganondorf. Spent all the money on the pool and the beans. What food didn't you have at your wedding? We didn't do anything for our wedding. This was all done by Zena's parents and they are very generous people. So we had so much meat. We had like all kinds of foods. There was like twice as much food as we needed. We had two weddings even and it was like that both times. Did he invite Miyamoto to my wedding? No, I can't let him know where I live. Do you know how it's gonna be like a fruit island basically? Do you know Yoshi's Tropical Paradise from Mario Party? Kinda like that. And that's it. Good thing we didn't plan the food because I'm not sure how the guests would have liked steamed chicken and broccoli. You've never actually been to a wedding? The first wedding I went to was my own too, Lila. Are you going to update the points goal? Right, okay, guys, we need a new channel points goal. We cannot do Kamschig anymore. I'm thinking, I mean because it's already been done before, I'm thinking I have a more fun idea. Instead of Kamschig, we do Tunaschig and it's going to be a group goal. So multiple people can add to it. Let me just figure out where to edit this. Manage rewards. Let's see, default rewards, let's see, Kamschig, okay, we're going to edit Kamschig. It's going to be Tunaschig. Do not shake. Drink a tuna protein shake. Tastes and smells like canned food. Very healthy. 10 people need to steam this. Current progress, 0 out of 10.  And we're going to make this only 100,000 points. Tunaschig has been updated. Actually, I need a picture of a tuna. Tunaschig base. Shit, that's not a good one. Convert and save images. There we go. Okay, hope you don't ever cook for your kids. I'm going to cook for my kids. How do I edit the image? It's not letting me edit the image. Have you seen Vazana's video on the Daily Kong Racing? Yes, I was actually planning to maybe make a video about his findings. Okay, I can't figure out how to edit the icon. I'm going to do this after the stream. Any cooligans planned for this level? What is a cooligan? Do you want a Tunaschig right now? No, do not. It needs to be 10 people redeeming it. So even if you do redeem it, it's just going to be 1 out of 10. Maybe a better punishment would be a Chaos Mowering playthrough. Hello, Yomiga. Hello, Yomiga.  True, true. Wait, so did your dad make you like crappy food so you would like him more? I don't know, B-Turk. It might have just started working for some reason. Maybe. That sucks. You redeemed Tuna Shake? Okay, well, that's progress. That's 1 out of 10. I have updated the Tuna Shake to say 1 out of 10. We're 10% there. 86 kilograms Leela Ark was crazy though. That does sound crazy. I can't even imagine that. Do you think Mariozis would be like calling you a ladybug if you were like still 86 kilograms? What's in the Tuna Shake? Okay. Tuna Shake. I will tell you the story of the Tuna Shake real quick. Markus rühlt Tuna Shake Recipe und Fischprotein schickt. Dude, okay, well. You take tuna, you take a banana, you take some rice crackers and that's it. And the guy that invented this is him. He, no, that's not him. Him, this man in the middle. He invented the Tuna Protein Shake. He call you a whale. He's 11. Fair. Rice crackers, I don't know. I'm gonna stream overlay to place in the corner. Check discord. Wait, let me make sure I don't leak anything. Actually, fuck it. Maybe I'll leak something on discord. No, no, no, it's not gonna be that active. That is a funny overlay though. Why you look like buff Alex Jones? What is that black texture thing on the floor that always in the level and play solo? Yep, that's all play solo. Cooling inside a penguin enemies from Super Mario Bros Wii. Oh, no, we're not adding those. Will the different areas be their own islands? I feel like there's some competition where maybe cannons shooting you off or taking a boat. Yeah, something like that might happen. Hello game maker. Hello everyone. I can answer the question faster, yeah, true, true. Snellycorns need to come. What is a Snellycorn? Hello XC Terminator, I have no idea what you're talking about. Snellycorn, alright. What the fuck? I don't think I've ever seen this. What's your programming language? C Hello Clayman, Snellycorn level in New Super Mario Bros, oh, I don't think I played the DS one, so maybe that's why I didn't know. There we go, my Snellycorn Sona, it's the best one after Wanda. What about New Super Mario? What about Super Mario Bros 3? Can we rank all the 2D Mario games real quick? From my perspective, someone who hasn't really played any, I think New Super Mario Bros Wii is the peak. And then after that, it's just downwards. Wanda's at the top, I haven't played Wanda, so I wouldn't know. Super Mario Bros Wii is piss, well, it's the only New Super Mario one I played. Actually, I played the DS one minigames, no, nevermind, the DS one is the peak because of the minigames. And I played Super Mario Bros 3 as a kid and I liked it a lot, but I wish you could have saved in the game because I never managed to get anywhere. I think the furthest I've gotten as a kid was World 7. Wanda's objectively the best, OBJECTIVELY? It's made for 4 players, so it's all empty areas with far away cameras, but I did play it with 4 players. What, you think I play New Super Mario Bros Wii by myself? You think I'm a fucking loser? Dude, the Yoshi game, Yoshi's Woolly World, had a lot of potential. If Yoshi's Woolly World moved the camera with the player that is furthest ahead instead of the one that is furthest behind, I would love that game. I don't know if I played this one yet. But Woolly World was like fun to just dash through. The ones I've played... Okay, let's look at this. Sorry, I have not played this one. I have not played this one. This one here is dark shit. This one here was pretty fun. I've not played this one. I've not played this one. I've not played this one. This one here was alright. Don't like this one. I have not played this one. Wow, I have a really good opinion on this. I'm so glad I have such good opinions on everything. No, Karzai, you can't even rant. Whoops. Awesome. Perfect. Dude, we need more F3 trailers. We've gotten like 12 so far. It's a little bit meager. If we don't get more, this year's F3 is gonna suck. But I guess there's still a week. Cool. The release of New Super Mario Bros. is better than Super Mario Bros. 1. Yeah. My first Mario game was the stupid PDS one where the gimmick is collecting a shit ton of coins. That's unfortunate. There's something I need to discuss with you guys. And this is a test on whether you have a soul or not. Let me just close my Twitter VM so no one sees this. What do you think of this? When I was a kid, I used to bring Mario over to the spot and pretend he lived here. And what do you think of this? Kids, me and my brother used to play Kirby's Air Ride and pretend Kirby had a car shop and I'd be like, yeah, this is my car shop. Leave your money by the door. And then he would drop the shadow star into the volcano and I'd go, oh no, that there was 500 Kirby dollars. Did you guys play games like that too when you were kids? Because I absolutely did. Yeah, but you can't name any specific locations. I remember playing Star Fox Assaults where everyone had like a home and we would like have like fights from our homes. Spend hours in a starting village. Oh, that sucks. He did it in Minecraft, but it was kind of the point. Uh, yeah. Yeah. You play hide and seek in the daycare level. Oh, that's awful. So cool. One popular game is also like pizza delivery and Mario 64, where you like pretend to be a pizza delivery guy and you like to deliver the King Bob-omb. Did I set the beat arm of this by accident? I did. When is it going to get past the front of the castle in Super Mario 64 DS, so I'd play multiplayer mode alone. Saddest thing I've ever written. That is very sad. It's a universal thing because kids like to play. They're just looking at it like toys. They're not trying to like beat it, you know? I think that's what's going on. This is what freedom is, you know, this is what it means to be a human.  Interesting effect, not what I had in mind. So I'm just impossible to finish for a kid without Googling. Yeah, yeah, I can see that. Wait, this is supposed to be the bottom part. And then this means the top part is gone, so we spawn a new bottom part. And our B-param becomes 2. Right, and that doesn't reset the action... And this is what we do. Sure, Timmy, you can get the team in your room, the only thing you have to do is get all the blue coins and it's all Gamecube Game Easy, right?  Oh, that's kinda neat, I didn't know that. I guess that just means modern PCs are so powerful? Oh wait, no, that executes them with no translations needed, so they just have the same instruction set. That is crazy. Okay, let's build the snowman. It just looks terrible. I guess we need to halve the scale of everything. It looks like a dog with Schwarzbein Syndrome. Yes. Okay, so they are in the correct distance of 7. We are a bit ahead from each other now, I think, but we still... Actually, maybe the top part needs to be a bit down. But yeah, we got something now. I guess I didn't halve this one. It's 5,350. Now we should make a snowman on the floor. Oh, Biobank, has your opinion of the voice changed now that Season 4 came out? It's the new season, to me, I have a feeling they made it on purpose, but if I wasn't buying an EP5, I wasn't buying an EP6, it was cringe as fuck. EP6 was definitely cringe as fuck, but I feel like they have slowly worked up to that. They... Okay, see, this is my crazy moment here. We were watching the episode together, me and Zeyna, and I said, wow, this is like they make it bad on purpose. This is like they're making like a parody of the 120 Days of Sodom. And then halfway through Episode 6, someone opens a book called the 120 Days of Sodom, and I'm like, what are they doing this on purpose? Are they making some kind of social statement that society is fucked, that we enjoy stuff like that? That's my conspiracy theory. I think they're doing it on purpose. It's like bad on purpose. I genuinely think that. Snowman looks good though. It's been bad writing since the beginning of the season. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, they made the whole season is like disgusting on purpose. And like EP6, it was like so much disgusting stuff that they just didn't have time to put plot on the episode, I feel like. Yeah, the shadows are way too small and he's slightly too much off the ground. Wait, I just realized something. We also need to somehow make him roll. Like that moment where they're surrounded by a bar of characters that can't say anything and they don't even try to use their powers at all. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Season 1, 2 and 3 were great. Season 4 so far, generally not even half as good as season 3. Are you going to have to summon Smile? No. Did you see the plot twist at the end of EP6 coming because everyone online says it was obvious and I never even considered it? No, I didn't see it coming either. I mean, I didn't think hard about it, but no, I don't think it was that obvious. If it had been that obvious, people online would have said it before. I mean, come on, be real with me here. Do I need to divide this? That kind of looks right. I don't think the snowman is too big. I think this is a good size for him so that he can roll his head at you and be like a threat. Am I still not showing half of my message on my client? I'm not sure. But if it shows up on stream, that means I probably saw it too. That's what you're worried about. Because my computer isn't good with using modern software to add things where I can use custom features and stuff and everything. But can you send different characters into a room? Like Peach and such? You have to program that in. Yo, Jinxy, thank you for the 26 months. Very appreciated. Okay. I kind of want him to look at Mario here. Oh, we also need to do these two. I can't find nw4c anywhere. I have no idea what that is. You can't replace Mario's objects with another game. That's not gonna work. You need some proper coding knowledge to do that. It's a little too complicated to explain in a Twitch message like that. When I went to the YouTube channel Unreal64, he got banned for impersonating Unreal Engine. Should these maybe have like an angle threshold of how much they can really turn? Because most likely they're going to be used like upwards, so I would only want them to shoot the thing downwards. Maybe they shouldn't turn at all and just like roll the head off once Mario comes close. Doesn't that make more sense for a snowman to not rotate at all? I think so. I give it a very weak acceleration and also a very weak rotation to Mario and I think that will play well. So let's not mostly roll free, but also kind of approach Mario. Why not make him hop to rear-end himself instead of too much effort? No, no, no, no. The thing is, he's gonna be like up there and you're gonna be platforming upwards. So if we had him rotate around towards Mario, then he would be shooting his head upwards and I don't like that. You know what? Now that Unreal got banned, maybe I should just do playthroughs of every romhack ever and upload them to YouTube. You think I could make good money doing that? Good views? I'm not gonna do it, but someone should fill the niche. I would unsubscribe unless you played My Axe, awesome. Longplay videos get 100 views max. The longplay of 64 and on my second channel got so many views. Wait, how many is that? This one here. 72,000. Okay, it's actually not that much. I thought this was at like 200,000. Yeah, I really don't wanna do it. It's not worth the money. It's not worth it. This is true, Arthur. I need to program an AI that plays video games. You guys know what I did for my second channel? I paid other people to play through my romhacks so people could watch people play through it. Hello, Portal guys. Thank you, thank you. Damn, Arthur is ruthless today. What's going on? Oh, okay, the gameplay has to be uncommentated, right? No one wants to watch it commentated. Well, some people would want to watch that. But I think if you commentate it and you inject yourself into the playthrough, it kind of loses the value. And when I showed my face, you said I looked like this. Like that isn't far more insulting. How is looking like me an insult, huh? I'm being chased by snowmen. All right, awesome. All right. Doesn't mean you're bad looking. It's like in the same way that looking like Hitler is bad. What? All right, Arthur. How does it feel to be the same gender as Donald Trump, huh? Got him. Okay, wait, let me think about this. One rotation is this multiple by two, multiple by pi units. So he needs to rotate that much per, no, multiplied by a thousand. So U of 32 for rotation units equals. Do I have to find pi anywhere? I do. This should work, right? Wait. The other way around. The other way around doesn't make any sense. It definitely needs to be this way around, but there's a factor missing. Is it 65536? It tells you how many units of full rotation. So this is how much percentage of full rotation this is. So we do multiply by 65536 afterwards. Dude, Skelenio is real, that's crazy. I've completely forgotten that. Okay, he just shrinks a little too fast. Is that not coming out? Is the guy not still working on it? I think that was a work in progress. Last, well, actually, I don't know what I can say about it. I have signed a spiritual NDA, I guess, because I talked to people that worked on the project, so I can't say anything. He's definitely shooting way too many bullets at me. Let's just take a look. How cool is that? And if anyone's yes, yes someone made the procedure regenerate mr. 64 Can you guys believe it's just two weeks until my child is born I've never spent more than 5,000 hours on wrong making but it doesn't take 5,000 hours to get this good Most of my time here was spent actually making stuff not running stuff And unity using lipisms for true Gonna point one less than two weeks. You're expecting Leela What are you expecting? You're gonna have your bloodstone again, that's not very exciting is it I Mean fear of needles is kinda silly, isn't it? It's definitely an irrational fear. You can just turn it off You But you can just turn off irrational fears, can you not just ignore them You And the shadows definitely fucked up I Supermarket thing all over again. What's the supermarket thing? You have to excuse me I say so many stupid things in a day that I forgot which ones I've already said Hey, let me give an original battery is would you write your own engine or would you I would just use unreal engine I mean, that's not that bad Oh I'm your cat Okay, the shadow scale is fine now it's pretty good Okay, this is solid too I Just don't like how fast he's attacking but I think this is pretty good now, what do you think guys? I Except for how fast he's attacking Hello buzzer Chris favorite n64 player besides Mario 64, which other one is there Circuit rolling a snowman in the snow makes it Look they have to disappear somehow. Okay. I know it doesn't make sense What are you doing Mario We are making a game here in Mario 64 banjo-donkey-man Kirby 64 and Raymond I Don't like the banjo games. I And the Kirby game is like playable if you do it a double speed but it doesn't have analog controls so I kind of you know There isn't really a different good one on the n64 Favorite type of pizza salami pizza easy Do you want it to get bigger bio back and then like it explodes when it hits a wall or something I Think that could make sense I Am German I can make them smaller And I like the animation here I think this battle is gonna be pretty fun. All right, I need to be a snowman here too that you push That was the idea right? There's a snowman here and you push it and it falls Into this window and there's a star behind it The doorway fate was sick. Oh Right This is how we're gonna hide the rooms. I haven't programmed the room system yet, but that's how it's gonna work I Just have a little feels pretty free and then you can just go wherever you want And then with elements like that that's gonna be fun to move around to And it doesn't even matter if you missed a jump because you're always gonna end somewhere At least it's the theory We still need to fix this section here the section here sucks with the camera Oh you hear that wait look at this You heard the double jump sounds Oh, that's from The coyote timer I Guess it's fixable. Oh I don't want to randomize the rooms programming that feature would be terrible I'm working on return to Yoshi's Island on coyotes I Wasn't your wife on the streams anymore you've had her at times on here it's because we moved and he she now has her own office Okay, well the snowman is done now, let me just make a note for that So We can move on Interesting platforming rooms. Okay. We have most of these written down already Okay, well we didn't do that glowing blue lights this is all still to be done Yes, this is to be done I think we may now move on to actually making the level. I think we have all the assets we need But I'm gonna let's okay Snowman to break star In the wrong wall You're gonna need some decorations at the end of the castle feel on my opinion true I Think I'm gonna change the first room how this one works a little bit. I think this one It's a bit stupid. It's like too contrived. I Mean, this is a necessary part here And this is a necessary part too, but all these slides from here that don't really do anything I Think maybe we should just remove these two here And then put something else here Hmm it's probably already a lot better. This is the entrance. Yes It's not very thematic, yeah Well, I want people to come in and immediately see the star You Right, you are going to immediately see the star you're going to immediately see a snowman form too, but the snowman's probably gonna go Well, if this happens you immediately know what's up You It's more room to fill thing about then you should come with all the ducks popping out of the ground True yes Well, we don't have the issue of having rooms to fill right now actually we have good stuff in all our rooms I I Like to snowman enemy, too We're just gonna think of a better way to insinuate the first room here. I Think you should see the penguin statues. I think making those visible would change a lot about how this feels You How about this is running on n64 it's gonna run really well on n64 because in the end it's gonna be all Full of rooms, of course right now it runs pretty poorly I Don't want them to be perfectly mirrored I think For six four here Or six five here. I guess that's fine. It's about the same They might have been misaligned before Hello, I'm your cat you are a showcase fan I Said I see how you're gonna budget. Yeah This room here is kind of an example of what I want this level to look like with like walls like this That look like ice is growing on it Can you have a I help you optimize the game AI is very bad at programming right now can't really do this You Okay, and this changes the vibe of the entrance a lot Too big penguins the stars gonna be there. It's gonna be kind of like a powerful visual. I Don't like how barren the sides are. Well, I guess the sides gonna be less barren because there's gonna be the slide thing But that also means that the snowman head is gonna go against the slide So maybe if we rotate the snowman a little bit Long carpet made of piss snow. Oh, yes a carpet is a good idea Not sure about the piss snow, but the carpet yes Kanka reference? You know what? Just vet for a day is kinda like the voice season 4. You know what I mean? Type 1 if you get it. You didn't get it? Well, don't type 1 then. Lila is hereby prohibited from typing 1 because she does not get it. I'm not old, I'm just like... It's slightly beyond high school age. I'm not old. Thoughts on HouseMD? It's kind of like Dr. Mario was cool, true. I balded for a second, yeah but I unbalded so I'm young again. Zena is gonna bald me again after stream. I hope I survive it this time. Never watched much of House so I don't have many thoughts on it. I just know it's goofy. Married man about to have a child? Look, I'm still young in spirit. I still say Skibidi. I have some wrists. I know who Kai Sanada is. I'm hip with the kids. SkibidiK's toilet. True yeah, I know of that one. I know exactly what you're talking about. And then decided to give you an honest review of just one whole game on what you want. I guess I'm taking Tears of the Kingdom. Tears of the Kingdom? Dude, if I could just mod Tears of the Kingdom in official capacity, you know what I would do? I would add so much cool shit. I would make so much more out of the vehicle building. That would be like the whole game. There would just be a race mode where you can build the vehicles. And it would be awesome. How come the, oh, the recents is done here. Hello, Masquerade. Did you mention Tears of the Kingdom? But there's like a versus. What if there's like a roguelike versus battle royale mode? Think about this. All right. Let's say you have like 100 people in a match and you're all given like five random zone pieces and there's like a race map in front of you and you're told to build a vehicle to beat this as fast as you can. And then after you're done, you get to pick like one or three new pieces and add it to yours and you go to the next map and you keep doing that until there's just like 10 left and then, you know, like four guys. But like you get new pieces, new zone pieces to build new vehicles. That would go hard. Hello, Sam memory. Hello, Kek Honka Honka. Look, you can't tell me the gamers are not yearning for more battle royales and roguelikes. If they weren't, why are there so many of them buzzing? If I can, let's just see how this feels. Can you make an SM64 card based deck build a roguelike? How does this work? I just want to zone I devices to matter in the world. Tears of the Kingdom. I don't care how we do it. We just have to do it. Okay, this is a terrible carpets. Maybe Biobank's piss carpet idea was better. Could be the ultimate shitpost mods. The ultimate shitpost mod, honestly, is Doki Doki Mario 64. It's still crazy that it exists. Like just think about it. Someone actually went and like wrote all those scripts just to date the Mario 64 enemies. Ice carpet reflections. Oh yeah, that would go sick. Do I have reflective ice anywhere here? Damn Arthur, why are you so mean today to Leela? What did she do? Or is this like back in primary school where it's like you bully the girl you like so she wants to see her. Check hydration now. I could go for some water. Hello, Mr. Arch. It's been a while since I've seen you trying to reverse engineer things. Well, the whole game is reverse engineered. There's not much more left to do. Right now, I'm just making my game, you know. Let's see how this feels. When you finish this, what are you going to do next? Are you going to print something else? I'm probably going to make my own game at that point. This is a normal course. I think that looks kind of nice. I'm going to have to make it super slippery. But just the frozen ice carpet has a nice feeling to it. You compile it, Leela. You mean Mario, Mario kind of reflections? I can add that, but then doubles the tricone of this room. But I'm up for it. It's just going to be something that we have to do at the end. But yeah, we can do that. I've lost that case code. But you can't say I didn't tell the guy how to code fire Mario. I give them exact instructions. Instructions, exactly. He has received instructions. This much is undeniable. I'm going to have to make my own game at that point. I actually don't know. I feel like response on that would be funny. Are you being subscribed, Botted? The notif is going hog wild. Oh, that might be. That happened a few days ago or a few streams ago that someone followed Botted in this account. Yo, thank you for the Prime Riolu. But yeah, it happened a while ago that someone followed Botted in this channel. And I turned off the sound notification and all that. It's just a visual one. So that's probably what's going on. What does Emmanuel mean? When I was 13 or so, I wanted to make a Facebook account so I could look at Facebook. But I didn't want to put in my real name. And my name online was Case. So I just put in Case. And I was like, the fuck? And it's asking me for a second name. And then I just typed in Emmanuel. And it didn't make any sense. I just typed in the word. And that's why that's my name now. I have inputted that name just everywhere since. Oh, no. The Blenda thing is there. Oh, I forgot about this. How do you fix this again? Where Blenda messes up your UV map. I am missing magic UVs. So revive first and merge with MB. Okay, that definitely doesn't work on my setup. But you're saying to separate them first. That sucks. But that's the only way I need to do it too. Okay. Ah, someone's fast 64 is updated for the later version. We're all good. I wonder if there's someone that can solve this problem for us in the chat right now. Hello, spiny rat. Oh, we moved on to the pilot wing 64. I didn't even notice. Okay, this entrance is starting to look nice. Maybe the snowman should be a bit smaller. And evidently less attack distance because that looks really stupid. Let's make the snowman smaller. Should we do something about the bot side? They are being pushed by the wall. That's the issue. It has a negative scale now. What the fuck? How did I manage that? I'm just going to make them a bit smaller. The top part is still way too big. 475 multiplied by 0.8 is 380. Ah. Oh, heart is relative. Give me a task as a comparison and then I'll tell you whether it's easier or harder. Do you think... How do I formulate this? Do you think it is harder to make Ocarina of Time run at like 60 FPS on the emulator than it is to do the computations to land a rocket on the moon? You just have to land the rocket on the moon. No one has to survive on the rocket. And you have like infinite fuel and resources. It can even crash into the moon, you know. Depends on the time of landing. Any landing. Getting that mathematically is easy, super easy. Okay, okay. I didn't win on 1996, but they couldn't get OOT at 60 in 1996 so I know what I'm choosing. True, true. What's this course name? I don't think we have one. We don't have one yet. It's the not dying and landing part that's hard. Yeah, that's why I made the stipulation that everyone on board is free to die. You're allowed to kill everyone on board. You just have to hit the moon with a rocket. Frozen Forgotten Forests Fortress. Forget the feel of publishing, but you still have to figure out like how long it takes to get there and where the moon is going to be at that point. Cold Cold Cove. True. That's some Mario 64 name. Oh, cool. Cold Cave. Getting really creative today. Risky for I was thinking more something with the illusion in the name I see illusions okay this is this is gonna sound like an insane man speak but I want I want a name that is sharp you know what I mean it's a minty name as you can see PT doesn't have a soul it's not gonna understand what I mean when I say I want the minty name that's true it doesn't have much illusion nobody understands what you mean you don't know what I mean by a minty name this is boba and Kiki theory I want a name that is more like Kiki you know Kiki is like spiky but it's not minty but it's kind of like in the Kiki direction but like mintier now if I said I want a spiky name I would think about Kiki but I want a minty name it's a sherbet minty yeah a little bit it makes sense I'm so glad you are on board with boba and Kiki theory peppermint no I don't want minty in the name I want a name that feels minty chilling mirage castle we need an alliteration or a rhyme in the name I feel like we don't have enough level names with a rhyme in it minty feeling fortress feels very minty no not really blue corn mountain has a rhyme to it it does not cool it does not rhyme with cool I don't count this saying cool rhymes with cool it's like saying two is a prime number you know what I mean okay now I'm on purpose saying things that don't make sense I like how the star looks here maybe I want to reduce the opacity of this a little bit but does it really feel like a prime number like when you think of a prime number you're not thinking of two you're thinking of like 13 17 37 maybe 73 truly 73 is a prime number so you don't even know if 73 is a prime number or at least most people won't but 73 everyone has to be like yeah that that feels like a prime number it's the most prime number okay there is no evaluation on how prime the numbers it's either prime or not I could say the same about 305 yeah 17 is definitely more prime than 19 it's made of two prime numbers so it feels exactly and in the same way we need a minty level name it's the only prime number that's divisible by two what a fucking surprise like come on every prime number is the only prime number that is divisible by itself that's a stupid crazy breezy castle breezy breezy kind of fits yeah that okay that's that's decent but it doesn't really capture the essence of what I want this song sucks thank you for the input is arctic and minty words kinda I think part of minty is like the word should feel like it hurts if you step on mint minty is not cold it's on a trick yeah yeah can you say minty was different it is different from spiky but it's kind of similar to spiky but it's not exactly the same as spiky that's what that was my point to make a list of words that's on minty senior selection I don't know if words really are minty or if it's like a list of minty words and ask it for similar ones I don't know if I can do that I remember when I was visiting a friend for the very first time I stepped into his house and I was like dude your house smells so orange and no one had any idea what the fuck I was talking about I have some synesthesia yeah but I don't think it's like extreme I think everyone has some level of synesthesia though mine's just like slightly more than average I have all really aren't there like people that can literally think taste numbers okay well I guess I guess you can kind of do that but like some people actually like get hungry when they look at numbers right because that's how much synesthesia they have bring up chat GPT you think chat GPT knows minty words all right let me let me ask chat GPT for minty words give me a list of minty oh give me a list of words that feel minty it says fresh cool refreshing invigorating peppermint spearmint brisk icy zesty menthol tingly chill hmm now I think minty is kind of like sharp words like all of the words feels sharp but minty is in the difference because it also feels cold frizz snappy zingy chilly frigid art cutting icy prickly frostbite frostbite's a good one nippy jacked bracing searing piercing me in case this is when your code is a vintage sent frostbite fortress already yeah I'm not sure about that I don't know it might be too early to just settle on a name for the level hasn't cooked enough yo thank you for the 15 months sub larry so I don't think that rhymes hype train oh shit thank you for the five gift subs dang even lila got one most mario 64 levels don't rhyme most mario 64 level names are terrible though can we really look at mario 64 and be like well they didn't try so we don't need to try either that feels lazy I don't know man somehow we got the scam train in my chat so the idea is that you can push this and it goes in there and then it's shot us and I think tall tall mountain deserves an award I mean okay if a banana glued to the wall deserves an award then maybe tall tall mountain deserves one too yeah we'll go with that one what's the mouth feel of hazy maze cave it's like a green with high opacity hello hecka 2077 what is bro on it there has to be something deep inside you and that associates like words with sensations right has to be something like what about the the popular question like what color is your this math you know and then people are like oh my math is red my math is blue it's not really not at all you don't even have an association for like what color is player one women that are this rglmc and nr women yeah like that yeah but it becomes more ingrained than you at some point right it's still based on past experience but everything is kind of based on past experiences so there should have been a separate function the whole time so  wait this is done twice that's unnecessary was it like that here too it is okay cool we can remove this then Aurora Morialis Palace, I mean, I guess there's some of that outside. I guess the whole level is also a whole village. The name doesn't need to refer to just the castle, the castle is just the main part. Maybe it's even better if the name doesn't go to the whole castle. What's Dementia's number? I don't know. It's gonna change every time you think about it. And Squid Meat never had it, sounds nasty though. Thoughts on this MrBeast tweet? Let's see. If we lower the age to run for president, I'll jump in the race. Okay, MrBeast becoming president in the future would actually be hype as fuck. I genuinely think MrBeast would probably become the best president we've had. Or America had. Or at least in the top 3 of the last 400 years. I know America hasn't been around that long, but I actually think that. He would just turn it into content, dude. And trap 500 war criminals in a white prison. Late 1700s? Yeah, something like that. The reason I think he would do a good job is because he might not care about making more money. I don't know if that's naive. So corruption wouldn't really be an issue. And he probably cares a lot more about his popularity than he does about money. Because popularity is money, right? Same isn't really true for many other presidents. They have a lot of incentive for corruption, because their salary is so much lower than what they would make if they just gave in to corruption. Is this the wrong way of going about it? Compute val xc. Yeah. This is the wrong way to go about it. What's the 17th used for? I don't know. Undefined references, of course. This doesn't work. Cool, cool. Does it even matter now if they get noticed? Doesn't the president know, like, he came? Maybe. Mr. President. I'm sure if he wanted to rest, he could just say, I don't want to do it anymore. I don't think the situation's that dire. I don't think the situation's that dire. No hate. I have a real job outside of YouTube, where I earn most of my money. But also on YouTube, I make around, from AdSense, I make around like $5,000 a year. So it's not nothing. And then there's a bit of Patreon income as well, which is a lot more than my AdSense. But of course, my real job makes a lot more than YouTube. He's not moving. I don't even just pass a massive one. Dude, you know what the best part is? Now that I have a wife and a child that's soon to be born. I actually have a shot at going on to Mr. Beast's challenges. You need to have a wife and a child to be eligible for it. Because otherwise, you're just going to get all the money. Otherwise, there's no drama. Oh, we need the angle to Mario. It doesn't explain all of it, though. Oh, wait. Okay, best part. We're back to Diddy Kong Racing. That's crazy. I did something. I set this to 151. We'll then do what I need. We'll only run when the age of entrapment is lowered. No, he will run as soon as he's allowed to. That's what he said.  Yeah, let's see what the minimum value is for this to work. I guess it pushes Mario slightly further out of the object than the radius. Which makes sense, actually. Yes, it's also pushing Mario by his own radius. So 176. Yeah, he's currently not allowed to run, Skyloft. That's why he is not running, at least according to that tweet. I think he would generally have a good chance at winning. The question is, which party would he run for? Would he just make his own? Then he just loses, right? You need to be in one of the two parties. Probably independent, but then he just loses. That was weird how it moved to the side. And rolling slowly is not a mission that is difficult to fix. Oh, this is why it moved to the side. What game is this? I'm making this game right now. What is Project 2025? Hey, there we go. Next, we just need to give it slope physics. So that it accelerates and decelerates when this happens. And then we need to make this shatter and we need to give it some wall bounce. And then we're good. Is Project 2025 the porn ban thing? Doesn't the US want to ban porn? No case no? Yes. Which one is it? No case no or yes? The porn ban is part of it. Okay. Why is Lila no case no casing me? It's only part of it. Well, a scallops. Unfortunately, doesn't matter to me because I am already free of them. I am ascended. What's going on in the ice castle? Yep. Oh, this is the one by the Goombas. This one is what we want. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. This is what I want. Okay. It also needs to move its face in the direction. Wait, no, it doesn't. It already does. Oh, that's good. That is good. Let's try this again. Elegant solution, I guess. I think it just seems like it's an election between two great evils because painting your opponent as a great evil is like a good strategy. Because fear is like a strong motivator. No, it's not doing what I need it to do. Oh. Why not? Let's see what happens now. This does not do anything. Cool, cool. What a debug print here. I'll be honest. Never voted. We'll never vote. Don't care. There's so many people. What's the point even? Oh, okay. It's never really moving on the ground. That's why it doesn't work. Bad opinion. I think it makes sense to vote if you take a sense of personal pride in it. But to actually change the results of the election, I don't think it's that effective. Launching a full-scale PsyOp is way more effective. You should look into that. All right, we got the snowball to roll. Next, we need to program the glass shattering. But that's for next time or maybe I'll do it offline. Actually, my offline project right now is programming the anti-aliasing options. So once we have that in, we finally have a toggleable anti-aliasing, which is going to be really cool. But yes, I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye.
