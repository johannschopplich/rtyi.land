What the hell is going on? Hello MariLuigi, hello VTARC Hello Sara I'm going to be working on this today Hello Wince Hello XCRC Hello MrInstrument Ah good! Today we are working on the rework of Chris 1 that Biobak just finished We're going to have to start first so we can do the demo release So today's dev menu, working on the Chris 1 rework Wait, what? This is different? What happened here? These look like they're supposed to be the same thing Oh, is this a slightly different looking texture? Once you have to do it, do you expect to finish? I am not sure I see Yeah, I don't think we can do this because of render order means So we have to just do this, unfortunately I have not looked at the actors now I did some pretty cool stuff off-stream yesterday Look at Mario's nose Do you see it? It's actual rigid body physics, or soft body physics, I don't know how you call it Oh, it's the old song for this level Okay, not entirely unexpected Let's do the order, the drawing order Well, Mario doesn't have 3D model balls, so that's going to be a bit difficult He doesn't even have tack-shot balls In fact, Mario 64 doesn't have any balls at all Hello, EZ-1000 The best thing about the nose trigger physics is that they're a pretty cheap tool Oh, I also didn't show you guys this thing Look at them, they intercept me Hello, Mario Nova Yuck That is not good Okay, I want to move all the layout 0 stuff into a separate object first of all Wait, is that fine? Should we move these to layer 0? I think they can be layer 0 This can be layer 0 Hello, Biobak Can this be layer 0? I think it can be This and this can both be layer 0 Wait, not those But this one, yes It's a one-second machine Okay, no, it is a two-second machine Wait, it undid everything I just changed? That's not good Yeah, we didn't do the collision yet Music is too loud, can barely hear you Oops, how's this? Can't wait to play this on my CRT This will be banging hard on a CRT What's going on with the flowers? I don't understand the question What's going on with them? If you have a question, please make sure it can be understood so I can answer promptly Alright, the layout 0 has seemed good The only thing that's wrong is that part there with the trees Yeah, you can tell the drawing order here is pretty fucked But it looks like they don't even render above that thing there, which really shouldn't be like that Interesting That's layout 1, that's 0, that's 0 The music will probably be perfect, fine Any recommendations for console compatible ones? There aren't very many Wait, can this actually be layout 0? This has me second-guessing it, because yeah, this will just draw over it, but then why wasn't this being drawn over? That's concerning I'm not reading the right render modes What? Can we maybe duplicate the material and make the outer layout only be a layout 0 thing? Something like this part here It's like nothing can draw over it, except that stuff, which doesn't really matter Or rather, doesn't need to draw over anything Yeah, that's what should be determining this, if it needs to draw over anything, then it can't be layout 0 So we should make as much as possible of this layout 0 So viewed from this angle, this can sometimes draw over something, so we can use that But we can use these here Or maybe not these two But then again, we can use these here Ace just thought, Leela, what you just said makes no sense I don't think you understand the problem I think it's these that we can make layout 0 The demo will just be one stage, nothing more I don't know Yeah, it should, we will be reworking it, that's what's dangerous Hold this up, it should be in pink Oh, anything is possible Alright, now it is time to order these I think this needs to render before the thing above Oh, this is difficult I guess these should render first, and then the other thing renders above it This definitely needs to render at the very first That doesn't need to render here at all, because it's going to be a separate layer altogether It's going to be the NPG This renders right above Ace Oh, right after, that's right And this is the stand stuff that needs to render together with the main background That's good, okay I think... YouTube Alright, what we're going to do is, we're going to first fix Area 1, and then we're going to import the actors, and then we're going to do all the creations Ready, render, hit home That's perfect, shouldn't we? So I was thinking of maybe making a series on my second channel, that's going to analyze why every individual course is worth playing I'm going to think about why it is worth playing every individual course in RTYI And I think while doing this series, I might realize important things Maybe people can give me important insights once they hear my thought processes My hope is that that will be useful somehow Did I sort the mesh elements? I don't think I did Some of this looks not good Although this is surprisingly all good Any nitpick? What do you want to nitpick later? Only if it's not stupid The difference between your speed and your zephyr texture using a decal? It was like that at first, and it looked terrible I like this now Actors today? Yeah, hopefully I just want to finish the main array first, and then I'll move on to actors Cat face Lina, do you remember what order Blenda will add these elements to her model, depending on how I merge? Does it even matter? Because I need to be able to sort this If I can't sort this, I'm fucked Is it whatever I click first will go first? Like, will this work? I need to render them back to front Just sort sort by distance? I can't sort all mesh elements by distance, because I need them to be sorted by material Do the sound? I do not know the sound I need to set up a faster mod to get here I swear, the order changes every Blenda version, so I also never know Maybe it's the first 64 thing Yeah, that's completely wrong What if I first sort mesh elements by distance? Forza Distance, and then... Fun Material. Well, half the order stay. I'm listening to the DuckTales OST, but I just played the remastered OST, so I guess that is evil. Hello cake, honka honka. What the hell? So the first line is fine, and then the others are not fine.  How does this work? Alright, I'm going to cover it for the free, and you let Bleed handle it. Bleed doesn't work that way. Bleed remembers the location at which the texture was loaded, not which texture was loaded. So the location would be different because of Bleeding. Modding makes me some amount of money through YouTube and Patreon. There we go, that worked. But it's not even half of what my normal job makes. Oh, you mean Fast64 Bleeding, not FBDX Bleeding. Well, either way, it works now. Quick performance test to see if it got any better. Finished as much. Next you're going to return to your island part. That would be a banger, wouldn't it? The FPS is fluctuating so much, I can absolutely not tell what's going on. That's nice. But, let's compare this to our previous... Surely I have some numbers here. Alright, the numbers before Biobak's rework. Where? Nevermind, these are very outdated. 18.54, that's pretty good. That seems about equal to what I had before. Also, you see this idle time, 24.32, something like that? Think about it, in a 33.3 MS frame, we have 24.3 idle time. That's 73% idle. The CPU is not working two thirds of the time. I have someone making music for this, yes. And we don't even have the new actors here yet. So it's likely going to get even better. What's the average here, can anyone tell me? I should update my benchmarks though. This is like 49 to 51 FPS, I would say. I wanna just update the benchmarks, alright. Unlimited is around 19.7 here. Audio is like 0.54, seems about right, maybe 0.60. GFX 19.10, oh my god, that is improved a lot. RDP 20.7? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. It wasn't even set to X3 yet. Well, Biobak, if you don't run it on N64, you're gonna get garbage values, so... Hey Leela, how come it didn't... oh, because the repo settings don't make sense. All right, let's actually look at this in X3. Just so you know, X3 is a lot faster, because X3 allows for a larger vertex buffer. Well, not a lot, but like slightly. Who's Digital Foundry? Dude, the funniest shit happened yesterday. Apparently the director of Conker's Bad Fur Day wrote a tweet saying, I want to make an N64 game, and people were like pinging me in it and were like, Casey, you should work with this guy. And I responded, Ew, why does he like poop so much? I just learned every bridge, didn't I? A2A is higher. Okay, it doesn't make any sense. Another 3 billion contract money, hope you're happy. True. Can I get them on my N64 so quickly? Programming. Scheduler is only 0.3, holy shit, that's really low. Game loop around 2, rendering about 4.9, seems about right. Limit the FPS, check out again. A2A is around 18.6, I would say. Audio is around 1.1. Ah, it fluctuates a lot, let's just write down 0.95. VFX around 18.1, RDP around 19.55, seems about right. BI Manager, 92. Idle went up, went down a lot actually, which is not really good. Down seems to be around 9.0. Game loop is up a lot too, 7.6, that's a lot. But that's the same. Alright. It actually runs on the N64 console. It doesn't just run, dude, it runs at like nearly 60 FPS still. Look at this. Ignore that, that's just a broken game. Oh, but this should not be broken. Oh. I don't like what's happening to those things. Ew. Those are some issues. Let's figure out what is wrong here. Probably don't want to multiply coverage in alpha, that's definitely gonna be bad. I imagine it's coverage destination. Of course default coverage. Save too. Then. I'll just keep it at save, that seems to be the best option here. Let's test that again on the N64, make sure the rendering bug is gone. Every time I watch the game it's buggy, yeah? We literally just imported the rework of the course, of course there's gonna be some bugs. This Biobak is not modeling directly on the N64, he's not gonna know what's going on. He doesn't know what's going to break and what won't. We're done in PNG with a fake clear background. Sometimes the summer cut does that and I don't know why. That's a long upload today. My ROM by the way right now is around 63 MB. So we are reaching the upper limit of how big a ROM can get. Which is good because we are in course 14. That's still not good. Well the stripe in the middle is gone, which is very nice. I don't know why. Hopefully actually. Did I compile the game? Don't know if I did. Oh, I definitely need IMRD on this. Duh. Emote transport seems fine to me. I don't know why. I don't know. Just a single one thing. What's with these individual bushes here?  I also turn off CBOT right here. Surely that's off everywhere now. Okay. External memory by 67. Oh, 64 MB is the limit. Can you lower a little bit the music please? It's difficult to listen to your voice. Again? You were telling me to up it just a little bit. I have never looked at the Mario head screen. But my guess is on yes it is very very optimizable. Because it absolutely is not optimized at the moment. It doesn't even run 30 FPS on a console, does it? Green flower UVs. Flower UVs are perfectly fine. You may be looking at the collision map, which has no UVs. Have you seen a ROM launcher in 67.1 MB? I also figured that was the limit. Okay, well, that's not a problem. The limit is like 254 MB. But if you go over 64 MB, are you really still making an N64 game? I mean, you could argue you're making an N64 game because it runs on N64. But at the same time, it's kind of lame, right? It's like you're going beyond what they were able to do at the time. It just feels like cheating to me. What is wrong with my fingers? Joseph, what do you mean by- Ah! Ah-ha! I must scream. Like I've said, those flowers, they are invisible. They are the collision map. They do not exist. Just ignore it. What am I doing wrong here? Do I need to use framebuffer color in Cycle 1? Surely not. Surely that wouldn't affect this either. The hell? What's the difference from like this? I guess coverage and things are different. But I have used coverage for Alpha Checked. Of course that's not going to work. God damn it. I must have accidentally checked that sometime. Could give collisions a different texture? Every shot has an if attached to it. What is the if you're talking about? Every shot goes towards a goal, right? What is the goal here? Before I can evaluate whether your statement is true, I need to know what your goal is. Are you trying to dictate a goal to me?  It should have slightly improved performance too, by the way. Because I just fixed one of the bugs. Yeah, you can see that this is all done now. The RDP is slightly down. Cool. Oh, cool. And it's beautiful now. Ooh, this is just what I wanted. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Oh, hell yeah. Remember this place before? If you're standing here and you have all graphics as expensive as possible... I think this went below 30 before. Ooh, I saw a 29. Ooh. Someone's been saying the texture looks weird. I'd rather just yell at people, honestly. One day you'll learn. I don't care if I'm yelling, I'm good. All right, let's set up the background here. What's lighting up? This one. So, one change Biobak requested was... Instead of the whole level being nearby, there's an infinitely far background here. Which is easily done. I think we are on 17. We are on 17. That is correct, the collision map is from the last rework. Okay. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And this would be 17 here. Yes, I have an error called far away misses. What you gonna do about it? You gonna be upset? You gonna cry? And the ground collision? We reworked the level and some grounds changed. And the collision is not being worked with. Biobak is like a 3D artist. We don't need to make him do the collision work. I'm not sure how sold I am on this being the InfPG because the clouds are too high up now, I think. So, I'm gonna move him down a little bit. I think Biobak wouldn't agree with me here. Yes. And now they're too low? Oh, cool. What is one of the display lists? They are lists that you use to display info on your N64. Don't we know? Yeah, that's about what I want. Are we in agreement here? This looks good. I'm just gonna move the sun flare up there. You said you also wanted the sun to spin, correct? Like when you turn the camera, the sun texture spins? This can easily be done. Like when, like you see on cameras when you have shitty eye. True, true, true. Alright. Let's see. First of all, where is the location of the flare? Minus six, seven, four, seven. And then Z is one, five, two, eight, nine. And then Y is, it says minus that, but it actually is plus that. Because axes are being rotated. So now the lens flare should be in the right spot. If I did everything right. Hello, Devos. Oh, perfect. Oh, that's so cool. I much like that. I much prefer that. It's like actually you look up and you get blinded. This should have happened when you look at the wing cover entrance. That's for real. Does Nintendo have an excuse here? I don't think so. This feels like Super Mario Bros. 3 vs. Super Mario Bros. 1, but like even more. Can we go slightly? I don't know. I'm not sure. 96% doesn't exist. You're right, man. Why didn't I think of that? I think I'm pretty sure this already is the prettiest N64 game there is. I don't think you can really make an argument against that. Every frame rotation multiplied equals 1.01. That is terrible on so many levels. I don't even love a response to that. Looks like the rotation is fine. Oh, it's from Diddy Kong Racing. Perfect dock looks kind of nice. Yeah, are you enjoying 15 FPS? So, where is this? Okay, here. We might need to rotate the UBs individually. Let's use a function. Wait, what were you thinking with the function? Were you thinking I should make a geotranslate rotate node up here and then translate the pitch and yaw in a way that it rotates in the plane of the sun? Really? That was your suggestion? No, it was your suggestion. Okay, fine, it was. Don't worry, it's understandable. But no, dealing with the UBs is easier. Do you guys want to see how I did Mario's bouncy nose? You already know? How about the others? Just rotate the texture plane. That's so expensive! I'm not rotating a whole texture plane. You wanna know? Alright, alright. I will show you the model. It is a genuine physics bone I added to Mario. I need to delete the nose physics. Because it's not the plan file with the nose physics. It actually is garbage. Let me just delete that real quick before I get confused here in the future. Okay, so the way it works is that there is a bone in Mario's body. That points here. But it's not an animated bone. This is a physics bone. I programmed the type of physics bone. So, we have the GeoMarioNoseJiggle bone in here. The function. And what this does is... It stores the last position of the nose. And it computes from there how much the nose accelerates this frame. And... That is stored here in the nose acceleration. And then from the nose acceleration, it translates from vector normal to yaw and pitch. And from there we increase the nose angle velocity. And then this is just pendulum physics here. And then on the next frame we apply the nose jiggle physics. Onto the rotation bone which we get from this. Which relies on this being set up in a very specific way. So this is hyper-optimized. If you make one change to this, it's just gonna crash. But it works very well. Can you go from bone jiggle physics? No, that's not possible. Without some performance or ROM space things. Fine, I'll change the song. I can go from whatever you want. It's a video song. Anyway, we need to have a creative format on how to store them. I did not think about this beforehand. Shit. Oh, it's... No, it's not all the same. We have a rotation. And on top of the rotation we also have... Magnitude being whatever the fuck. What? Okay, wait. The rotation seems to be only one of a couple values. It's either 0, 45, or just a multiple of 45. Which means we need 8 different rotation values. And then the magnitude is below 0x3FFF. Right? 1FFF. Which means we have the 2, the 4, and 8x3. Which is 8 rotations. That's what we'll do. Black and 0x... What was the number? E0? Rotation. Black and 0x1FFF. Magnitude. We are free to get whatever that we want. We are also free to do whatever we want. And that's what we'll do. Yeah, that's what we'll do. We should live our lives the way we think it ought to be. We should live our lives the way we think it ought to be. Does this compile? Does this compile? Nope. Nope. I'm missing the A here. What the fuck? What am I doing? There we go. I'm just adding a little fudge factor to this, because I saw some stuff was weird. Imagine if I got arrested for $5 10 years ago and I want it back. That sucks. But fortunately, C's are basically worthless. People pay you to pick them up, so you can just get a new one. That's fine. Sweet, sweet, you're so sweet. Sweet, sweet, you're so sweet. Sweet, sweet, you're so sweet. Sweet, you're so sweet. Sweet, sweet, you're so sweet. So I'm just gonna get an angle from the camera. It doesn't really need to make sense, it just needs to be a continuous function that takes the camera rotation as an input. Sweet, sweet, you're so sweet. Here I come, rougher than the rest of them. The best of them, tougher than leather. You can call me Knuckles, unlike Sonic I don't chuckle. I'd rather flex my muscles, my heart is nails. It ain't hard to tell, I break them down whether they solid or frail. Unlike the rest, I'm independent since my first breath. First test till the right thing. Born on an island, in the heavens. Oh my god, how have I already been streaming for an hour? Did not feel like an hour. I don't see any rotation. But that might be because I'm not rotating enough? Function hooked up? It is not. I did not export the level. I would do it. So what's going on today? Entertaining. What's new in the world of humans? You go down this walk? I heard that, I heard that. Talked to a god on death, and was told I made good money from this. Okay. Well, I see the issue. We know it works though. That's what I needed. Middle is at 102.5. Cool. It's not at 1024. 1024 is the diameter, but that's not the middle. The middle is at... 1008? I will pretend the middle is at 1024. If the real sun did that, we would have a big problem. Okay, this is a... Something? Which doesn't make any difference. Interesting. Oh, probably because I'm in C-Up. Okay. That is something I want to change. I get this power to wipe out the path again and again. This is my planet, gonna fight. I won't be frightened, I'll stand up to all the pain and turmoil. Just believe in myself, don't rely on... That solves that issue. The other issue... It's a little bit weird, is it not? This is my planet, I shall not surrender. The Maori world is in Andazolos? I don't know, it's a parallel universe. Yeah, there's some weird things going on with suns in the Maori universe, clearly. Shall not surrender, no. The new Porcupine on the block with the puffed chest. Out the wilderness with the ruggedness. Knock, knock, it's Knuckles. The blowthrower, independent flower, magical emerald. I think this would help. The coldest shoulder, my spike goes through boulders. That's why I stay alone, I was born by myself. I don't need a boss, I get it all for myself. Adversaries get shelved. Word on. Okay, this is closer to what Biobak wants, I think. Still not perfect. Something weird going on with the sun below the thing. Interesting. It's also too much influence. What's going on with the sun below? Wait, no, it's the sun inside here. That's being wrong. Is it not? Wait, how is this happening? Like, both faces to rotate in opposite directions? Oh my god. It is likely possible. It should be possible, yeah. It should make them rotate in opposite directions. It's a fucking car glass. What? Oh, you got an ad, I see. Um, I said it's likely possible. That actually sucks that there's ads on Twitch. It works. But what's that behind there? Do you see that? There's something weird going on. Oh, wait a second. What could this be? I think it's because it wasn't clamped. So no, we're gonna touch just a part of the texture when it repeats can fix by shrinking the texture and doing texture clamping. Yeah, we support texture clamping. It's just a little bit weird when you also have mirroring. Where's the texture view here? Oh, you don't actually need mirroring. So just turn mirroring off, then this will work. I'm thinking I should reduce the pitch influence slightly. God, that's gonna look so good. It's still doing it with clamping on. I think I should reduce both influences here. Why is it not correcting clamping? Oh, wait, I know why it's not correcting clamping. I pressed the wrong export button. I swear I hear Mario snoring. That might be glimpsing. That's bad. That's very bad. Why is that happening now? Kick the influence way up. I can double it. He's behind you. Who's behind me? You do not have that when you look right. I think you have astigmatism. It just instantly rotates 180. Trying to make the sunlight. No, it is already rotating. You rotate much faster. I think this is a problem with your eye. I hate to do this to you, but I think that's you. That's making the Zulu 16 help. Nope, open it. What the fuck? Do you not see this? Pretty sure that's astigmatism. I think that's astigmatism. I don't even know why I set this to zero. Is the bug still there? Is this something with right shifting doesn't look fine? What the fuck? Well, we wanted it faster anyway, so who cares? I don't want to bother finding out why exactly that was. It looks really nice though. I like it a lot. See like that? Well, you might also have that. A lot of people have it. It's relatively normal, I think. Yeah, we have a new actor for it. We still have to import it. Right now, I just did the main area. Now we're going to start with the actors. First one, change lock. Actors. Yoshi egg. Play animation and render to see. Okay, well, first of all, we have a Yoshi egg now. I'm guessing it's this one here. Yoshi's Island as lighting.  Broken eggshell stays there after you've gotten the star and the collected star is above it. Egg color can be changed with prims so it matches the coins per level. Shading color should adapt to egg color. Oh, you have a lighting color. That doesn't work. We can't have this in game. It's going to have to look like this. Very unfortunate. Yeah, I know that sucks. But if you really want, we can subtract the environment color here. Make this slightly blue. Where's the environment color? Here. Subtract the environment color. Make it slightly blue. Make it very dark. Make it very blue. Something like this. More money. Are you sure we can do this? But then you say nth color was evil. It is evil if you don't do it for code, but we were going to do this for code anyway. Right? Because we already have to set prim to whatever we want. The level is not the star of the mountains. The level is the paper crop level. We can't name the level after three blocks of geometry in it. It's a bit of an issue. Why is that two different X here? Does this have any meaning? Is it just because of the texture being different? I think we said we were going with this texture, right? Oh yeah, chat. What do you think? Which texture? File back one's opinions. Come to think of it, I actually have a new song as well. The thing of it though, Bandu made a bunch of new music. We just play some. For the grass area. Remove the other texture. That's a good point. Oh yeah, definitely this one. It's not even close. Do you think there's a difference? Stars when have no milk? Stars when have milk. The whiter one? Lightness is the same. It's just about the pattern. I don't know all the colors yet, so we'll do that some other time. Doesn't really make sense to do it right now. This song is so happy to do it. It makes you happy to listen to it. Should probably be around Mario's side, maybe. This seems about right. This is going to be a global asset that spawns the coin star when you get the Yoshi coins. Hello Mimic. Considering I have to import the entire actor though, I'm going to do this later and not right now. I'll add this to my to-do list here. That's my straw adder, we did that. Reposition the landscraper, we did that. Import Yoshi Egg Program. Bouncy float? Bouncy float. Ooh, nice. Oh, this is the thing. We all knew these as a kid. Oh, what I forgot to mention is, this song has versions for every biome. Isn't that cool? Let's see if this explodes for me. Nope, it did not. Minimal changes required. There we go. This is for Chris 14, yeah. It's not in-game yet, but we have a bunch of songs. There's also this one. This is for the pyramids. That looks weird. That's weird.  Adult plus 64. I like the little goby's belly in there. There we go. It looks like they're supposed to be down a little bit. It is what it is. I played some vanilla Mario 64 roaming today, and it really just feels bad to just be back on vanilla physics. Let's fix this first. The transition depending on what section you are in the level. Yes! It will smoothly fade mini-channels in and out. That's always fitting. Oh, there we go. Beautiful. Alright. Goomba King. Saved for free materials and helm is half the size. Let's see. Saved 14 triangles properly scaled so you can remove the scaling in code. Um, wrong file. Oh, he's very nice looking. Saved free materials. That's crazy. We will have to add back the blinking. Much better looking Kron. True. This does look way better. Removed inside of the head hidden by Kron. Okay, that's good. Big facial hair. Fancy a clothes? Yeah. I had so much room left for demon and texture that I gave him souls and shine to his shoes. That's pretty nice. I don't think there is an armature here. There is this zero triangle object here. That I might want to keep around just for the texture. Look under him. There is nothing here. Oh, the souls. Yes, of course I saw that. Import and animate boombudging. It is very clean. Oh, he is not imported yet, so I can't save him. Spiked Goomba. Oh, that's cool looking too. He has the same animations. Interesting. Updated design. Looks 200% more stupid. Now red to match the rest of the scene. Updated jump animation. Simple, but will probably look funny. Alright. How am I going to export the animation without fucking everything? Good question. Goomba anims. Goomba. Is he group 0? Goomba is not group 0. Is he common 0? Goomba anims.geo is in common 0. Alright, we got the jump attack in. There we go. Let me show you how big the actor folder is. Well, most of the actors are stored in levels, so it's not an issue. Wait, I need to set this all to fvd as well. I need to inline this. It's going to add so much more performance as well. He is in level bob. Goomba needs to be an exact match. Oh, we're going to have rogue files here. Multiple definition of spike. Goomba underscore geo. Really? Castle grounds. Oh my god. Hatred in my heart. Where are you from? Canada?  Hopefully it's going to be more fun than the PS2 game. I hate video games. Do you think branding my content as like, I hate video games, which is why I'm trying to make a good one, because I think all of the ones are bad. Would work out. Trying to make the first good video game. Yeah. A 100% blame me for that. You're going to be on your ass when it releases one floor and you're cooked. I know.  They were going to be on my ass anyway. Let's be real. This area looks clean, though. I have my issues with this. To be honest. This is amazing. True. This looks amazing. True. It looks so good. Apart from the issues with the animations. Yeah, actually, that's pretty good. This shine here is way too dim. I'm running instead of clipping them through the ground. They only look like they're clipping through the ground because they're so big right now because of some kind of bug. They're obviously not supposed to do that. They're not supposed to do that. I'm not animating correctly at all. Is the music for this boss placeholder our final? I haven't thought about it much. This is just a song that's been around since before I ever had anyone compose for this. What's going on with the scale here? Yeah. I should do it. Run on Goombas looks flat. Have you been paying attention to the stream? Recurrently in the process of importing the model updates that Biobuck made. One of the updates he made is in the Goombas model. I should do it now, I think. Give me Goombas to go. I'm getting my organics to start. This is the first enemy in the game. I don't want something like that. Okay. It all looks fine except for this thing here. Something about the scale of this is just way off. I still have to build one bomb. It does. I wonder if this would help. We're gonna change the Goombas fight a little bit though. So don't worry if you think it sucks right now. There's one change planned. And that is the way he moves around this kind of junk right now. What's going on with the thing? It's like it's inverted. Wait, is that what's going on? Is it inverted?  Why would it be inverted though? That would be so weird. Hello, I'm Uji. Welcome to the stream. Oh. Of course. It doesn't copy the rotation of the parent object. Because it copies the rotation from the billboard matrix. Shit. I respect the attempt, Biobak, but I have to change it. Okay. And I need this hub to be down. How do I... I have no idea how you work with this. Okay. I thought billboards were proud for performance. Yeah, sometimes they are. It's quite nuanced, honestly. Am I living? I am. Okay. Okay.  It needs to be at the center of the billboard bone. Unless the billboard bone officially starts up there, then that would really suck. God, I hope not. Now, billboards have easy offsets. Surely Fast64 spots this correctly. Why is the stone green instead of mastico? I don't know. Oh, so your name is just unoriginal. Oh, you mean those stones right there? Errs. He goes up his ass when he falls down.  Stone floor 9 months later. Your mom 9 months later. Yeah, that jitter when they get up really doesn't look good. I can probably improve that somehow. I'm not sure why the geometry here is so small. I thought there was a scale by 1.5, but like... I mean, it undoes the scale. The way billboard bones work is very limited in this. Because I realized that billboards are only ever used for things that look like spheres. So the assumption is made that anything you want to render with billboards is spherical. The model looks fine. The animations don't look fine yet, but we can fix it. I think this is as far as we need to go in this stream. And I can fix this off stream. Looks a lot better than before either way. I'm just gonna add this to my to-do list. Fix spike Goomba animations and stack in floor and shit. The stack in floor and shit looks so bad. Castle doors. Draws on a castle floor should be animated and only open when the Goomba King leaves. Fade from fully white vertex color when colored to the vertex glass in the model when opened. Goddamn. I need to animate that. Oh, also we said that these are way too transparent. They are not setting the level. I would definitely add two things. Use texture zero squared for the color. I'm just gonna add primitive color alpha to this. But you see I'm not positioned as much. I think the jitter just needs to be turned down by a lot. Okay, adding primitive color to this was a mistake. Anyway, you can make a live streams in the playlist. Like one for each world you've worked on the stream. Uh, no. That is an unreasonable ask. I have to make the doors exactly though. Program and animate those doors. But I can't do that on stream anyway. It's gonna take too long. You need to realize my streams is like minimum effort. Really I just stream because I want to stream and because I like having people be able to give me feedback on this. I'm not trying to be like a professional streamer and live as a content creator. So I will not do anything except the bare minimum. Yeah, that's too dark. Or too opaque. Why is it so opaque and how can I fix it? Doesn't look like the preview at all. Wait, do you want that to be an IA8? Interesting. And then what's shade color for here? Shade color is so dark. Definitely be IA4, I don't know if he wants this to be IA4. Everything is precisely calculated, so you want it this way because it's so transparent in-game. I don't want to add a little bit of this to this. Look in-game as it does in Blender, it doesn't look like that at all. It's not even close. You basically can't see it in-game. How do I turn it on? Seems a little bit closer to what you want. Although, this might be overflowing now. Was it overflowing? I can't tell. Definitely not this. Squaring texture 0, why though? Why not just set this to 1? Isn't that the exact same? It is literally the same. It's ruining it, I made no change, it's the same. What the fuck is going on, my music keeps pausing. Evil ghost in my computer. Evil Leela is ruining it. Hmm. I see the intention here, I'm just not sure how to do this properly. What if we do this? I'll have a look a little bit closer to what Biobak wants, I think. Alright. Bouncy Flower, updated design. Let's take a look at the new Bouncy Flower. I had a lot of complaints about that one. Okay, it's no longer in the pipe. I don't want this. Definitely do not want to end color here. It once was in a pipe and then it slowly stopped being in a pipe, you know? And it was set to F3D. There's a Lunger and Hector Session, life is bad again. Literally murder him. Okay. Okay. Okay.  I mean, this is a global model. Interesting. I believe this is 32x. It does look a lot higher. Yeah, I agree. Oh, this is a DLX part. Hector Slash Bouncy Flower. Zero. Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.   What is girl food? Please explain. Fine, I will be back. No problem.  Oh, Delight Cement. Why so many tries? But who cares? Only one 32x32 material. True, that's better. Vegetables is girl food? I believe Leela eats vegetables. Probably munches on carrots. Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom. Then lettuce too. She probably eats potatoes, let's be real. Well, it looks good as far as I can see. You ate your girl food really fast, didn't you just inhale it? Windmill Propeller. Beela. Make Funnel Throat for this. For eating fast. Make her insecure about everything. Make her dull for every move. Did you just keep my collision map or is this different? Seems to be mostly the same. Collision is set to default, I feel like I wouldn't have done that. Probably want this to be woody, but also slidey. Put that on for too long. Sounds really good. Updater, gotcha. I was just taking my E, now I'm sad because of you. That's what you call girl food? I mean girl pills, sure, but girl food? Is it like that to bite down on it? There's definitely some random attack going on here, but it looks really nice. What is this one for? Oh, I see. Environment color? Not on my watch. That looks satisfying, it does. Perfect, it's no longer blinking. I will miss this tree stump here. With the tree stump removed, maybe we should put a red coin behind the window. But also maybe we really shouldn't be putting something behind the window. Unless we also have an arrow, a coin arrow here, beating you behind the window. I think that would be a little bit cute. Although I do remember Biobak saying that there are a few areas that don't have a coin really. My white pixel in the flower texture lives on. Despite all the reworks. Completely forgot the tree stump.  I need to add it back. Kind of a nice tree stump. Seems a little claustrophobic compared to others. It's just jam packed with fun. I added it back. Are the collisions so weird? Because it's a rework and we didn't rework the collision yet. We're finishing the visuals first and then collision. Scale the whole level 15% up? No! It's so fun to move in it. Alright, bunny Goomba. Three fewer materials. Two fewer bones. Oh, he had a bone pearl. Okay, yeah, that's definitely good. He only has one animation, right? I think he does only have one animation. Another bunny Goomba? That's the old one. Yeah, but he had this one before. Where is the... No billboard bone? And where are the feet parented to? How are you moving the feet? Eh? Oh wait, there's a foot bone here. Yeah, I will need to add another bone here for the billboard.watch level. Oh, and we're gonna have the same billboard issues as before. That would suck. Oh, actually we won't have that issue. If this guy doesn't rotate. There is only an outside of the windmill. I just found a significant weight to more than one. I don't know how I did that but I fucked it up. See if he works. There's a great seamanth in front of a nook and there's a camel in sight. Yeah that's the last thing I think. Well that's a bit of a rundown on this top and then this sky farm one. I don't know if I'm going to be seeing stuff, maybe. There might also be different ones because they don't fit the same restrictions. Something was really weird about that goomba bunny. I'm not giving you 64DS vibes, you can kind of see it yeah. Everything looks sharp but the HUD looks pixelated. You're right that the HUD is pixelated because the HUD is at native N64 resolution. The emulator can render everything else at whatever resolution you're running it in but the HUD, it doesn't have high-res assets of course. Nothing really weird about this. What's with these random translate-rotate commands? Okay, you made a mistake on the armature Biobak, that's why it didn't work. Maybe I can save it though. You know what, I can just remake them to look basically the same, right? Apparently I can just infer what you're doing here. That looks a little off, eh, we'll see. Yeah, the roll was changed. That's why there were translate-rotate commands and everything went to poop. Still gotta give this guy a shadow and stuff. Does he even tick right right now? Let's give him a shadow real quick. Oh wait, he's also moved to the side! That would explain a few things. Alright, I think he will be good now. Okay, this behavior no longer matches his animation files, but that's fine. He looks very nice. Let's see, what's the frame he jumps on? Like 10. Is there no behavior in the changelog? Okay. I can make those changes. Make files request the change of screen running. Same here as Sonic 06, this is true, verified by true American Patreons. Didn't mean to open Internet Explorer. Of course, I'll make those changes. It's a large language model, I cannot program. Okay, he looks cool as fuck though, let's be real. Do you think Changebee could find me a wife? You're hopeless. Committed war crimes in Japan? Where do you see that come as measures? Does it say that anywhere? I would absolutely put that as a commitment. Growing flower, just a little more centrated, hit the rest of the course. Alright. We can delete the spills off. What? What has changed? I don't think much has changed. I will just export. Lena is evil and she makes lowercase variables and that's why I'm forced into making lowercase variables too. I'm just a girl in a man's world. True. I just have to make sure the top still looks good. It does, perfect. Honestly, I do not see the difference, but I will accept this change. Rabbits, yellow and blue. Improved UV mapping slightly, updated feet and whiskers. Oh, the feet look really nice. Um. There we go. Second, I thought it was broken. Okay. You know what I forgot? I forgot to turn on X3. You have the bunny goomba. All right, doubled slightly improvements. Okay. Just making sure he is fine in game. Okay. Wait, can I not say that feet look nice anymore? It's a fucking bunny. How can you project the foot fetish onto that? I think that says more about you than me. Yes, I went there. It's a nice color. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Chat face. Freaks in chat for real. Is that the new bunny or not? Yeah, that looks like the new bunny. Nice. Paragoomba, updated to modern design. Oh yeah, the Paragoombas look really poopy. I did not really say that now. How did they look before? Oh, mine haven't made the sign correctly. Okay. It does not. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay. That's the last actor. After that, it's all the actors. Okay. Of course, we still need to do the Goomba thing. And they need to carry us to the castle instead of here. Oh, right. There's only one actor. There's some more. There are three? Retro flag, retro pipe. This is self-explanatory. Oh, you want to replace the pipe in the main area? You really want to style the retro pipes after the game that the pipes are from? It's going to be a lot of work to do this everywhere. The pipe for exiting the easter egg. Oh, that can just be in the model. It doesn't need a separate object for that. Right, it's a static object. It's actually better for it to be in the model. Flag. Otherwise, you can enter from the pipe. Oh. Let's see. You want to go out and go back. All right. Should be easy enough. Hopefully, I can finish course one over the week. I'll be working on this offline. For now, I'm done streaming and I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye-bye.
