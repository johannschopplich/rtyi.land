you you hello self and hello X links hello dragon cap man what's up you hello excellent gamer hello I'm your cat hello the legend of Zena the amazing easy you we're gonna work the overworld my blind here we go you I was working on fixing course 9 getting it ready for a beta test recently but since it's still pre rework there's still a few things that I won't touch hello Mika so you see everything popping out that's because it's the pre-rework I don't want to do drawing ranges before the rework isn't done damn it's hard to get up here what the hell I definitely need to make that better lots of some fuck issue there I kind of like this level this sounds very fun I didn't say this part which is the best part in the whole game the soundtrack is great but there is an issue with the loop somehow that is bothering me any OST wishes for today the care star OST all right let's do that let's see where we left off I think we were in part three I had a vario entrance ghostly boardwork we gotta do with the light host to JMB reference or dia-dia-dox reference I think that soundtrack is officially called dia-dia-dox and not JMP I love how Yoshi swing it's so cool maybe some sort of collision bug in my engine right now like sometimes I just face for geometry it is a real issue so what do we work on various engines try to charge how many coins you have plus one for entry into my zoo too bad you'll need a ticket and I'm saying it to a stinky red plumber with large noses there's a bang on outside he runs away from our because even if I was at a compas of our own except I like to buy a new ticket because he wants to free his family hmm I sent you the Yoshi swings just and the Yoshi model too the purple thing is a grape this is kind of fun to do maybe tea time I don't want to do that right now though so I think we should work on the zoo entrance next but I kind of don't like our idea for the entrance here I think it's a little bit bad or I'm trying to charge you it's just kind of dumb I wonder if just letting the player in this just better well maybe there should be like a maximum velocity you can gain from that because it does seem a little bit jank that you can do that in my opinion it's just too easy to do anyway I want a different entrance here I think the bar one just kind of sucks I mean bar is fine bar needs to be in the world anyway to sell you a star but what we have outlined here is too complicated it's not very elegant and that's why we should think about it again I don't hate the idea of there being a penguin out here that you somehow have to do something with it's just a lure pants hello Benjamin would it be okay to just let the player into the zoo with no other requirements just like oh you can walk in just go I don't think it would necessarily be bad secret entrance no it's not even well it is normalized in the animation code yes I only stop three components right so I need to normalize it anyway I crush maybe maybe a ride daily Delphox but to be honest there is a very good chance or well biobank will definitely rework this so I'm not too worried about that for now for now we are care about getting the gameplay to work fine are you streaming per frame no I found that's worse I gave it a try I had the code for it and working but I don't think it's a good idea Luigi will just have extra animation data that's fine why isn't it it just didn't work out well maybe I don't think so of course it's not a graph render true let's get barrio he's like Mario except in the middle of a gold bar or far real he's Mario but he lives far far away I'm cancelling your momentum I can jump to the floor to play how I wish like this oh no yeah Lila I think it will lead to worse performance I don't know if the other like urges and that's maybe we'll think about it the issues we just do not care much about right now anyway I want to think about this Mario thing I think our initial idea is bad the one with the penguin it's not more difficult to work with Benjamin it's basically no difference I mean there had to be a few changes I had to make because I was targeting animations directly for like the vine animations and for the chop swings but overall there isn't really that much of a difference you can throw penguins up a cliff yes yeah they've been gone for a while Lila what if we just let Mario enter the zoo unsupervised I don't think that's a good idea actually there needs to be something there to stop him but the idea of the penguin that has the tickets it doesn't have to be vario being in here it could just be a swamp here that's like well you don't have a ticket so you can't come in I did Lila but only because I don't want to also make fast 64 code changes my n64 is an HDMI mod yeah Lila it's not very relevant something about the animation still looks wrong to me like the spin it doesn't look 60fps instead of the zoo it just looked more like an actual zoo entrance since there's just a chain fence I mean we can do that that's that's not the issue the issue is the mechanic to unlock it and whether there even needs to be a mechanic to unlock it I guess too I mean you came all this way here maybe you should just be able to enter it maybe that's fine maybe it's just a one-time ticket you have to buy for like 100 coins maybe there's just a guy in the booth selling you tickets for 100 coins wouldn't be that weird history is already coin based that's true but coins do need some kind of purpose and I feel like you definitely have a hundred points by this point so should be fine we're not adding creatures made after the n64 era at least not official Nintendo ones no I definitely see the issue with it the problem is I don't really have a bad idea ah small crawl through entrance it's kind of a nice idea now that I think about it I like the idea of a crawlspace somehow let's get let's look at zoo entrances maybe we will find an idea based off of that yes it doesn't exist I'm your cat hello Rick Luton man these are all like big white gaps we kind of need that door here because this door is like the normal entrance but there could be like another fake entrance gate in front of this and just like a guy blocking you from going in but he's trying to be soft how to enter the zoo today that looks like a graveyard and not a zoo this is kind of a nice entrance welcome power yeah that is pretty nice but what's the mechanic to enter it you know if I goes up fishing no no no King Boomba is course one this is course four you give him money to buy for that's such a random addition I can't start no no that's nonsense it needs to be an overworld mechanic I mean we could just do that what if you just have to skip into the zoo like that now that's too unintuitive pops ice cap wing cap bomb cap cloud cap but she is also course two and not course four we want that to be mostly separate so the thing about this area is when you first get it there's not gonna be any Yoshi's later there's gonna be tons of Yoshi's because you free them from the Bowser level we want this to be accessible before the first Bowser level but the close part I'm a little worried that players wouldn't figure out that they can crawl we're gonna zoo gate that's not a mechanic on how to enter the zoo we're not caring about visuals right now we only care about the gameplay mechanic to actually get into the zoo so our current note here says that there would be a bar you at the entrance and he's like well if you want to enter you're gonna have to pay me this many coins and he's gonna say however many coins you have plus one and then there would be a penguin out here that you have to catch and he's like I'm trying to save my family they are in the zoo with the evil Mario here take my tickets and then you can use the ticket to enter so I don't want that because I think that's too over complicated and there's just too much shit happening there that's also too random that's not any better than the penguin one fortunately every other problem just because honestly that might be a fair assessment definitely daily Delphox it could be like a little dark door in the side of this and then you can just crawl through that maybe you would see like mice go in and out of there as well think about this what if there was a little cavey tunnel here that came out on the other side and you could call through it yeah crawling is used a few times in the game now you can't crawl from the get-go the apes and the penguins are both in course for millimeter for crawling no but actually you can crawl in course free for a thing so you might know about it by now but also if we make it very obvious that like people are walking through a crawl tunnel here maybe players are more likely to try crawling a more tunnel not about not sure what more I mean maybe that will work but actually if you put a cave here players are gonna be more primed to try and find caves in the world and that gives us a lot of opportunities now in the Delphox they are only gonna look similar because they have like short height as I can do that stick figures man yeah maybe that is the play then we just have vario tell you that you can't enter here yeah let's try that then all right we should probably change the entrance here a little bit because the way it looks right now I don't really like it I think if some salvage learning is that when the player sees a crawlspace they are likely to know what to do already I don't think a visual indicator helps there my worry was that the first time they encounter a crawlspace they don't know that they can crawl but I think if you have mice go through there it makes it more obvious so they stream about overworld work do you have any journal that tells me to crawl yes but I think that might be overkill honestly I think people will figure it out let's just go and edit see what happens what's today's stream about today yeah I'm fine with a coin in the hole how long is this on 30 minutes okay we need a new OSD guess this one isn't working I am deciding against this executive decision should have you lost against that it's 30 minutes though you're a no you know what I've become a hater for the Nintendo 3ds it looks so much worse than a Nintendo DS and it has like no battery life Mass Effect right so we can listen to Fire Emblem and HOST listen to the whole thing as I need you to tell me am I uniquely stupid here or is this normal so I'm self-employed so I have to file taxes and everything and I'm fairly certain I filed it all correct like I'm good at that kind of stuff but I'm still way too nervous about it like it just randomly hit me today nothing even happens I just don't know how to deal with it I am going to lose it you're stupid how do I fix it check my taxes am I correct well I think so too so then your DK's are managed to rule and even if they were wrong that wouldn't even really be a big penalty it's just fucked up that we have to worry about this so much didn't study something enough I I know very well I want to access I'm thinking anything like this hello red bird if you get it wrong then they will correct that and charge interest on the correction which yes that would not be a big deal so I don't know why I'm worrying so much about it maybe I just have too much to lose it's how to keep us in check they give us things we could lose what if we do something like this for the entrance I think that would look nice oh this is the most fire emblem as fire emblem song of all time you like my cuts you're going to today I keep legs very simple just squats and bad lift and I will kill anyone that says that like that left is a back workout it is a like workout I like to do curl I mean everyone likes curls pull-ups too and I mean what are your triceps or biceps what are you trying to train here so it's going pretty well I look at one McPortal for a second average case stream what is this child slavery why would I need to practice I am not practicing child slavery why would I need to practice it's a good one good job me from the past triceps or triceps I do nyan-nyan you know you know what I mean that's what the exercise is called it's called exit that a better zoo entrance we do this and then we have a tunnel on the side and bar is just going to be in front of there and be like nope you can't enter unless you have entered the level before then he doesn't care anymore because doing it any other way would be intensely annoying then we'll make it so as soon as he touched his rock you warp in and then we need a tunnel in here and I think that works did I just kill the transparent decal I think I did oh my god no I'm not gonna be able to fix it that easily we're just gonna say fuck it well we'll just remake it that's fine we need a texture for this see all the zoo entrances I see are like weird as hell what are they made of glass wood bricks let's do bricks you okay that could look pretty nice you where did my entire stream chat go guys what happened everyone's so quiet I'm all alone there's a kind of mail on the way to my house too excited to get into some romex nice the summer cut is very good the fuck are we supposed to write I don't know bro just fucking entertain me yeah what do you think I am your entertainer you streamer look that's awful you when will this hash release please you need a gentle stream right now like an average the average stream probably 0.02 hello Arthur Tilly and you guys know the only engine rework stuff that is now left is the operating system and collision BVH and then finally free we can go on to just make my game I mean this is incredibly ugly but I think something like that idea works no idea teased I'm honestly I case with an animations I think pixel palaver already works with that I was there was one point where I was thinking about adding it to this game but then I never went through with it it's none of these were good what am I even going for shouldn't this be made out of wood with my dinky ass top part there I think what is the better choice you it really would feed animation stone like the new counter-strike we can be like a photo to in front of the characters torso oh there's definitely bad ways to do it you Mario is all about spending your money to have fun that is true you maybe something like this mm-hmm I think I need longer bars here and that's a that can work that's what's interesting doing well I believe it you so if you make the influence from text one smaller text zero I think we could get there you so I really didn't make a big difference performance-wise Yeah, in this case, what is Junya doing? She's doing pretty well. The yellow looks like piss, okay. Maybe now it's less piss-y. Fair enough. Now that looks nuclear. Soon. True Bumsy 1B. Although to be fair, Romics typically have a lot more invisible walls than even the vanilla game. Unless we're talking about Tick Tock Clock. That is also true, I removed invisible walls. Except on the level edges. You can still hit invisible walls there, but they don't bonk you anymore. That sounds very expensive, SLX. I guess you can sample the framebuffer at that point and spawn a billboarded circle. That honestly would probably be fine. Especially because I imagine during a teleport, you're not gonna be moving much anyway. Doesn't this look decent at all? Nope, that looks poisonous. It looks like Wario's Zoo now. I'll give it that. Oversize that needs to drop? We'll see. If it feels oversized, then we can still dial it back. I do have a bit of a bug in my engine right now, where you can phase through collision, which is equally annoying as invisible walls, and I definitely want to fix that. Used to not be that way, but collision's very hard to get right. I don't know what that was, that black. Doesn't really feel oversized to me. Yeah it definitely needs a sign still that says Wario's Wildlife World. And then I'm thinking the crowd space here. Do remakes progress further faster when collabing with other nerfs, or is it more of a personal process? I find that collabs often progress less fast. Not for me personally, I barely ever do collabs, but when I watch other people, it seems that collabs almost always can turn sour. How's this gonna look? I guess we can make it come from above. I think it will look fine. How do you extend our old right click, what's that? That's how you do it in the new blender. I'm not sure, he seems to be quite busy. Prangle snakes from F3-X3 and use. Once they are properly integrated into FOSS64, they will save us a couple microseconds. I went over the numbers, I think it is less than a hundred microseconds, but that's still nice to have. Yes, the camera has some special functionality for crawlspaces. And absolutely, if it didn't have that, crawlspaces would be extremely annoying. That's why there is special functionality, because I noticed they were extremely annoying. Let's see how this works out. Is this a mousehole? Kind of. How do you plan on making the crawlspace model of the player? We'll probably have a coin trail into it and maybe a mouse walking in and out of it. Hello, CreamTema. Sauron actually pushed a new update to F3-X3 today and it was like a hundred microseconds RSP bonus or 200 even, something like that. It was pretty nice. And extended the floor of the crawlspace, that would really help visibility. Yeah, we definitely need to make the floor more visible. Alright, that looks kind of nice. Oh, it's the grass that's transparent. Hmm, okay, let me restore that. Diluc! Alright, let me restart it. And this time it's actually on it's own layer, so that won't break again. My camera actually has less dynamic stuff than Mario64's camera, to be honest. Mario64's camera has a lot of things that work per area. My camera tries to be 100% predictable all the time. So, there are a few situations where it's gonna be like, oh, you're in this level around this area, let's do that. It's all like, you're interacting with this shape of geometry, let's fade it like that, if that makes sense. This looks weird because of the floor underneath. Floor underneath, I think. Yeah, damn. That's not gonna look good. I think I have to just remove that, and put something else on the floor here. I don't like how this turned out. Well, there's like weird layering stuff going on. Makes it not that easy to do. Actually, what we could do is this. Just make it sand. Color it different. That could look decent. Obviously not like that. Yeah, that actually looks pretty good. Because of the shade alpha control I gave it. And then we can actually do the texture transition. Hmm. How much time do you usually do off-stream? A couple hours? Every day? Not sure. I do a lot of work off-stream. Definitely more than I do on-stream. Huh? How about that? Kinda don't like how far it goes in. It kinda needs to go this far, or there's gonna be other issues. Let's try it. Ooh, ugh. This level already has 29,000 triangles. And we don't even have the collision map yet. Okay, now we're ready for a test. You think someone might come up with an 8mb expansion pack? There is a meme in the homebrew discord server where it's like 2 days since the last time someone asked for a more than 4mb expansion pack, because this comes up once a week. And the answer is no, because like, no one's done it yet, even though they keep asking for it. Okay now it's very visible, that's good. This feels good. Yeah I mean I don't see why a bigger than 4mb expansion pack wouldn't be possible somehow. But also like, I also don't see the point of it. RAM isn't really the bottleneck on the N64 I guess, that's the problem. RTYI is very wasteful with RAM, they didn't really optimize RAM at all. I actually just finished making a video on waste of RAM in Mario 64, fun facts. I haven't chatted to Wiseguy in a while, so I don't know, but I'm confident that he's doing good work on it. What is it gonna have 8mb but won't do anything? Or does it really have 8mb and it doesn't do anything? With something that doesn't work better for the entrance, maybe with a fence on top of the walls if they're too low? There would have to be a gigantic fence here. But it is pretty cute what you made. And yeah, the problem is we do not want the player to be able to jump over it. Actually you may just say fuck it, if you can jump over it then you're free to enter the level. If you bought a Dreamcast instead of an N64, would you be doing this? Well I had a PS1 before I had an N64 I'm pretty sure, so the answer is probably no. Maybe a Dreamcast would have changed the course. Well I think I want the sign on top of here, or maybe on the side. Actually on top of there is the problem that the camera is not really gonna capture it, so maybe on this side is better. I actually want to do this. Yes it's two vertices more, but there's the advantages of quantization won't fuck me. Okay wait, I'm scaring the big pretty gate. Yes, but what else am I supposed to do? We can't just have the player look into the zoo, is the problem. Pushing it further away, we could do that. Yeah that might be an idea. Let's try that. And then pretty much the entire section after here would be a warp. No Bowser didn't block this gate, this is Vario's botlane world, so Vario is just charging money to enter. Bench some trashcans. Honestly, I think I'm up for a bench. Let's get a bench in here. Vario's morally grey. He's not actively trying to ruin anyone's day, he is just trying to eat garlic and fart. Which in itself may be responsive, but not morally wrong. Am I knowing Vario wrong? Have I been lied about Vario by playing Smash Bros.? Have it up in there, true. He is a sore loser. Oh I see. I guess that checks out. The only Vario game I played was I think the Gamecube Vario world, the 3D platformer. So I definitely mostly know him from Smash Bros. The thing that if I never called myself a Nintendo fan, rename the server from ZutZutZu to Wildlife World. Yes. Vario's Wildlife World even. I still don't fully hate ZutZutZu, it's just a weird name. This pipe is a great multilater. Unironically agreed. I mean it's true. I still want to make a Pokemon Yellow ROM Hack, just so my daughter can play the best version of Pokemon. And in this ROM Hack, what I want to do is make it so that modern EXP share exists. Usually the lead Pokemon gets like 50% EXP, and then 50% of the EXP or so is distributed to everyone else in your team, or 25%, just to incentivize the player to actually have more than one Pokemon in a party. Right now when you play Pokemon, you kind of have to do like, you have to justify to yourself to use more than one Pokemon, because you know it's a bad strategy to actually winning the game. And I don't like that. I want the player to be like, I have guys on my team, and it's useful. It's a good thing that I have guys, not like I am forced to have guys on my team. But yeah, I don't just have Crystal. Oh, I never really played much Crystal. I didn't grow up with Gen 2. I'm strictly a Gen 1 kid. Hmm. I don't know. I don't know if they have X or Gen 1. Maybe, but I don't think any of them have the EXP share I'm mentioning. I don't know, Pokemon RomEx are weird and I don't trust them. Okay. Okay, so I'm thinking we make this entire area here like warp area. If you go anywhere near here, you just instantly get sucked into the zoo. Open my eyes to the Veldt Recon mission and I've just completed decompiling my first class on a GameCube game. Oh, that's sick, M&B. Okay. Honestly, 100 for the radius here is fine. I wanted to reach from here, hit 30. That's like Sterak's 3-0 maybe? 2-8? We also need the correct warp ID. Uh, shit, how did we handle this in other areas? Warp to the levels 1-1. Okay. Okay. Ugh, not what I meant to do. Alright, let's check if the warp is good. Yeah, modding is completely legal. Double Dash, oh that's cool. Double Dash is also one of those games where I want to make a mod to just change one mechanic. You guys know how you have to play Double Dash like this? Please get rid of it. I don't wanna do that. My hand's gonna get sore, it's not comfortable. Well, to manually decompile, you need to learn Assembly first of all. Wow. Unless there's tools that are like even better than that nowadays. Okay, I think this works. That's kind of a clean transition, right? Now you're on this side of the gate. Okay. Big W? You mean like, like over there? Okay. I'm so scared that people will play this game and just clip all over the place. That would make me pretty sad. Yep, exactly. Decompilation is you take the compiled code and you turn it back into the uncompiled code. Oh, that's an issue. That should never happen. Alright, wow. Okay. Next we need Vario here telling you, no, just no. But also I wanna export the zoo level with the right warp. Let's do that first. Okay. Well, there are tools for literally everything. It already goes to the right area. Okay. Let me just check that the mob actually works. Okay. Perfect! Nice. Also, I'm pretty sure you can still do this. But I'm fine with that, honestly. If you can pull it off, you may enter Vario's wildlife world without crawling. It's probably gonna be what speedrunners do. And I'm kinda up for it. I kinda like it. Nice. Well, I'll probably have to adjust the velocity from these a little bit, cause this is just... It is stupid how much velocity you gain. Yippee! Like, that's just dumb. Vario can lose his cap in the game, but... You see the animation? You can do that. And this should walk you out. But that's for later. Ah, looks like we need Vario here. Ugh. He looks really good. Okay. I think Biobank does that for me. Oh. He can make more and more of Vario's moves. So if the player does a jump over him, he jumps to block him. That's exactly the plan. Just a muster to receive. That's just the angle. I think. Maybe? Eh, that's just what he looks like. Where are the animation frames? He doesn't have a jump animation. Honestly, that kind of works as a jump animation. To block you. I just have to edit it a little bit. Yeah. Oh. That's actually really good. Yeah. Yeah, mod if he blocks you like that when you try to jump over him. Yeah. Yeah. That's... Nintendo Switch 2? Yeah. I think in Xenoverse you can play as Yoshi, but for Yoshi I think you should make... Like, put some colours around the course where you... What? No. I hate cosmetics. I hate cosmetics. I hate cosmetics in video games. Ech, I exported to CCM. Yeah. Fuck. Actually... Just discard him. I hate cosmetics. Because... This is, um... Trauma... Trauma from playing Tears of the Kingdom. Where you go into the depths and you find, like, a thousand different costumes that all do nothing. And then they're mixed in with, like, a few things you want to have. Like, Zohanite or whatever. So it's like half the time you open the chest, it's just, like, punched into your balls. And the other half is, like, something you want. Actually, it's more than half. Then you just get punched in the balls. And then some of the Pokemon games I've played had cosmetics. And it's like, please leave me alone. I want to get out. Why are you spending so much of my time on this? I want nothing to do with it. I'm going to do a little advertising. I really don't know what to expect. It's just for fun. Like, Pokemon Biker's Wings don't get in the way. Yeah, they're just kind of annoying. Because the game spends time explaining them. Yeah, Tears of the Kingdom really pissed me off. Just an explanation. The game has worked so much, it's already has an in-game graffiti. Make an exclusive use of that. I mean, yeah. That's fair. I mean, yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, yeah. The graffiti maker I can see being fun. That is self-expression, because you can actually make it, right? But for clothing. I don't know. That doesn't really seem self-expression to me. I don't know. I don't know. I just never wanted to engage with a cosmetics mechanic. So, to put it into my own game feels weird. Because it is something I actively am bothered by in video games when I encounter it. Makeover Domino is making a new character? Yeah? I used to play MMO and there was no customization at all. Yeah, I would be a lot more fine if there was a shop for it that you have to go out of your way for. But if it's a reward for finding something, then it does bother me a lot. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Woof! Woof! Interactive gameplay? The way Mario Odyssey did it was okay. It was more like, you know, buy this thing so you're allowed to do this mission for me. There is hidden concept art in this game, not pixel art. 300 on me, okay. What? Oh. Wearing cosmetics affects the gameplay? So, like, you wear something and it gives you, like, 10% more jump head or something? I think that's fine, but then, like, why a cosmetic? I mean, actually, having a cosmetic representation of your powers makes sense. Sonic Adventure 2 does it. It's very cool. Just add some mini-levels. You want me to make DLC before the first game is done? Why are you asking for this? Honestly, I should just give him a very big hitbox on the Y-axis. Why not? Where is the check? What is the function called? Um, fuck. Check animation and that's not what I want. Check animation done. There we go. Game with this engine, would you make the engine more like modern engine? Like, with visual and no need to write everything? I don't know what that means, unfortunately. Some of these functions do not follow my coding guidance yet. Why should now semi-competently block the path? He does not do that. Bye, Wario. Bye. You should have, like, a shuffle animation here, honestly. This game gives 27 vibes? Dang. One? Oh, that makes sense. Why is the shadow so big? Huh? So it is less than that. Okay. So I guess this is never true? Well, my brain is so nerfed from the stress of the taxes that are, like, 99% true correct that it is fucking me up. I feel like I can't think. How is it not working? You see this 100 here? I meant to change it to 100. There's no point in thinking about it. I know. And, you know, I submitted them, like, you know, as soon as it was possible at the beginning of the year. So I don't know why it's happening now. It's intentional that you swim first. I want to play and just swim first. Such a random choice of words. I know. I used to not care about these things at all, but then I had a child and now I need to be, like, a proper civilian. I mean, the only explanation left is that the X here is too big, right? Let's just see what this prints. How old is she? She's a year old now. Well, a year and a month almost. Five thousand? Six thousand five hundred. Oh. I'm so mad. I'm so mad that was the bug. I'm not sure if I want to put her down the same path as me here. Here it's pretty easy to bypass like this. Oh, and he can clip you into the wall. That's an issue. He will talk to you in the end, like, yeah, you're not getting past me, bitch. Oh, I am pretty familiar with Unreal Engine. There is a good chance I would make a game in Unreal Engine sometime in the future. But also, I know how terrible Unreal Engine is, so probably not. Because I am familiar with Unreal Engine, I am less inclined to make a game with Unreal Engine now. I think it's possible to get past them. Maybe not. That's pretty good. I like it. Someone made it so that the first time you try, he tells you... He can clip you into the wall. Now walls don't have a thickness, that's the problem. But there is one thing I can do. I can do this. Now it will be completely impossible to enter. And there will also be no way he can push you into the wall, I am pretty sure. Honestly, knockback would be fun. Oops. That's the wrong axis. Oh, that's also wrong. But why? Wait. What? Why is this wrong? Wait, that doesn't make any sense. Oh, wait. Oops. Where is the vibe going, Mario? No. Alright, no more clipping is possible. I love how annoying he is. Now I want to make it also so that he's like nosy plumbers are not allowed in my zoo, getaway, something like that. That is exactly how it works, Benjamin. Well, not exactly how it works, but very close to how it works. Because you also need to be able to get here from behind him. So he just does that. And there needs to be a way limit, otherwise he's gonna do that. Make you punch. Nah, he's just gonna laugh at you. So ein Mist. Alright, I'm gonna do that. Alright, I'm gonna do that. No entry for nosy plumbers. Hahaha. Yeah, you need F, that's the plan. See, I have a to-do marker here. I'm just not gonna animate it right now. I was planning to make like a Mario AI, but I need collision BVH first, otherwise the AI is not gonna train fast enough on a real N64. Maybe he should also rotate to Mario, I think that would be better. Eh, let's make it a bit faster. Yeah, that looks a bit better. He's now very explicit about not wanting to let you in. Kinda feels like Mido from Ocarina of Time. Let's make a response and a spring down looks better. Um, no, thank you, I do not want to take a picture. Huh? How's this possible? What? I'm in jail! That's a problem. He never changes his Z position, so... I mean, maybe just to be safe I should use a home Z here, but still. Hmm. And he also stopped turning to me. Was the talk to Mario action state just not done? Let me check that again. Wait, that doesn't make any sense. He would still execute the rest of his action states. Hmm. I think it would look better if he only turns to you when he's here. Yep, that's better, okay. Oh, I see what's going on. He's rubbing up against the wall. Oh. Okay, okay, okay, I see. I should counteract that. The problem is the walls, they don't push him into the direction of his line that he's moving along. They push him just away from the wall. So now he should stay more in the middle. That's better. That's also why we got stuck before. Because one was checking position and the other one was checking home. But his position was moving. Bro is the best goalkeeper in the world. He does factor in Mario's speed, I just also have a base speed, so no matter what you're doing, It'll always get there in time. Damage speed. Okay, well... Well that kinda sucks. But you need to do like his crazy speed conversation and speed kick to do that. Well, and we're gonna fix that clip anyway. I think that might just be the normal collision bug. Because I actually don't see how Mario could possibly skip you into the wall anymore. Yeah, biomech still has to rework this. It's still very early. So the next step is make it so he doesn't appear if you have entered the level before. The pop-in pop-out is a pretty good solution, I think, for the thing. Alright, let's see if that works. We go here. We cheat ourselves into the zoo. We watch the intro cutscene. So now we have officially been in the zoo. Time to die. And now Wario should be gone. He has not gone. Is that not how I start the intro cutscenes? It is. Oh. I forgot to update that. Okay. Let's try that again. He's here. Cheat over. Watch the intro. Die. He's still here. Huh? Is there an issue here? Let's just rinse the Star Flux. This should be an S16, right? Ooh, there's still a U8. I guess that's fine? I hope? We'll see if that works out. That might actually just be fine. So, when I collect the red coin star, in the bottom left corner, it should say it's 2-0. Oops. 1-0. Is that star 4? Huh? 1, 2, 4, 8, 1-0. Okay, nevermind. Why does the 8-0 not appear? Could it be Kursnan-1? It is. It is! Okay, so there was a bug all along in the engine, where if you were watching a cutscene, it would set the cutscene flag in the wrong place. Okay, good thing we caught that. Now it will work. That's actually the same bug that there is in Vanilla Mario 64, with the cannons. If you open a cannon in Bob-omb Battlefield, it sets the cannon for Womp's Fortress open. Fun fact. So I think there's some level where you can't do it. Like, I think... I don't know, whatever the last level in RAM is. I don't know what that is, actually. Must be, like, the secret slide or something. There we go! Mario is gone. Perfect. Now Wario just needs to shuffle animation, and I think he is finished. And I also agree that you should just move to the middle when Mario is far away. I think that would make him a little less janky. Alright, good progress. We made a new zoo entrance, and we programmed Wario here. Let me just update the document here. Wario blocks your path to go over or around the gate via the crawl section. Now, to make this a little more obvious, I will add a coin path here. Thanks for watching! The thing is that this pixel is telling me that it looks too smooth and it bounces, how can it be a pixel but at the same time the bouncing is at a sub-pixel level, unacceptable. Oh that's an emulator thing, on N64 the bouncing is not going to be sub-pixel level, actually does it bounce sub-pixel level on emulator? I don't think it does. Probably turn off the TV, but just for like legal reasons. I don't think it moves at a sub-pixel level, I don't think that's possible in an emulator because we use texture rectangles, but I'm not 100% certain actually. Okay now if you don't see the entrance, you just do not deserve to play my level. Alright, we're good on that. Next we probably have to do the ghost ship or the message in the bottle or the boobla infestation or actually Vario's shop. But yeah, either of those is fine. I will see you guys in the next stream, which I'm not sure when that's going to be. Until then, bye bye!
