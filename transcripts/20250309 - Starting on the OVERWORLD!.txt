Hello, Clayman. Hello, stream. Today we're working more on the overworld. Hello, Rick Luton. It's a Chrono Trigger OST kind of thing. Let's do it. I don't think I've ever played Chrono Trigger. Is it any good? Is it an RPG? Oh god, please don't tell me it's an RPG. This is not real. Is it real? Hello? I mean, what did you think I was going to... How did you think I was going to draw a layout, Eiza? Huh? What did you expect? Or I will break every single bone in your body. Including the ones you don't even know about yet. Let me see if I can improve my audio setup here a little bit. What the fuck did I just do? I guess I hit the render button with my mic on. Why is it a wonky Yoshi? Oh, it's going to change a lot. Don't worry. We're going to just get a base shape. And then from there, we're slowly going to improve it. Hello, tea time. This sounds like Dragon Ball music. Whoa. Oh, that actually worked. Hello, I eat bottle caps for a living. Eat bro as a Pokemon. I only got onto playing the demo last weekend. It was Peek, my friend's remastered by the DJ Brannoplant boss. Oh, that was the old demo you played. It actually looks so much crazier now. I actually kind of want to showcase a little bit of it. Just to give you an idea of how different the whole game will be. If you played the demo, you probably remember this level here completely different looking, don't you? Oh, yeah, the end level is supposed to feel very oppressive at first. Until you unlock the thing and then you feel freedom. Because contrast is what makes the art. Look how much nicer this looks now. And I love this effect here. You see that? I'm not sure if you can see it.  Why did I level up a seizure for a second? When did I level up a seizure? Probably because I pressed fast forward. Yeah, I kept the sleeping animations. Let me just... There you go. Holding normal is hard. I know. Yeah. Now Lilaa is yapping. Oh, is she doing the thing where she talks about the game no one's watching again? I'm so sorry that happened to you, man. I know how rough it is with Lilaa sometimes. I know which one the other one on the list. Do not worry. This is 75,000 coordinates? This is way too fucking big. What the fuck? Hello, Skyloft. It's women's day? Alright, well, what do we do for women's day? Alright, I'm sorry, but it's women's day. You have to let Lilaa yap. It is her day. March as a whole is also women's month. They don't get a whole month. I'm sorry. I am not okay with that. A whole day, bro? Do you know a whole month? It's like 12th of the year. That's way too much. I'm sorry.           Black people as a whole get 28 days and women get March which is like 30 days? Come on, man. That can't be right. Why am I getting cancelled? March is 31 days? Even more? You guys hate women? I don't hate women. You've been told that Eiza is being misogynist in here? What's up? Oh yeah, Eiza was talking mad shit about women. He was so annoyed by the fact that it's women's month right now. He didn't even know it was women's month. Can you believe it? My audio fucking sucks. What's wrong with my audio? You need to turn up to 150% to hear me. I mean, I can slightly turn it up. Is it really that quiet, guys? It's awful.         It's almost peaking in OBS. It is peaking in OBS. No. So we're all gonna be different parts of the island? Or like, how's it gonna be structured? Yes. The overworld is just Yoshi's Island. You will be exploring the entirety of Yoshi's Island in here. And our task for today is to make a very basic blockout of what the overworld is going to be like. Leela, everyone's saying it's fine except for you. So I think this is on you. What did you think of the new idle animations today? You like that whole concept? Yes. It's just Yoshi's Island, man. You're not even going to be able to tell that it's a Yoshi ship in the end. You're not even going to be able to tell that it's a Yoshi ship in the end. You need to install the update code. You need to install the update code. How laggy do you think the game would be if it ran all at the same time at like 16 areas at all times? You need to install the update code.  Hit Fix the head animation. Hit Fix the head animation. What's wrong with the head animation?  Is Chrono Trigger an RPG? I don't think I can do another RPG, man. I don't think I can do another RPG, man. First improvement I'm really good at RPG's, but like RPG gameplay is literally either math optimization, or spamming your strongest attack over and over, unless you have to heal and then use the heal button. First improvement It's either so exhausting that it's not fun or it's just not fun. First improvement The only RPG that kind of gets it right is Pokemon Red and Blue, and I'm saying this specifically, because they don't use the battles for the sake of the battles. They use the battles as a tool to make you value your guys. Like the battles are super simple, but like, because your guys help you win, and there's enough difficulty in it, you start to value your guys, and the value comes in forming a bond with them. That's how I think about it. It seems it now turns into a metal texture. Oh, it does use a bugged out texture, yes. But that's not part of the animation, that's just a random bug that I will have to fix at some point. The reason I don't do it is because we're still reworking Mario's model, so if I fix it now, I'm gonna have to do the work again later, which I do not want for obvious reasons. Obviously I noticed that there's a bug, and obviously I will fix such a huge bug. Yes, the hat did completely change shape when he took off his hat. Look, it happens even when you jump. It's just the falling hat that looks like that. Doesn't mean anything. Okay, this feels way too big for the first part of the overworld. Like, way too big. Um, Luigi is a consideration, but I don't know a good way to add them. Yeah, it is that big in the sketch, unfortunately. What if we make the whole island smaller? That might be necessary here. Okay, why is this build around the world, so it feels more like Majang or Pokka, or is this just devoted more to Rock Paper Scissors type gameplay after? I guess, but like any difficulty you have, you can overcome by just grinding a little more. So really, the only resource you have in Pokemon games is time. And you start valuing your Pokemon based on how much time they save you, right? And that's where your bonding comes with them, I guess. What am I still being worked on? I mean... Not actively, but I don't have any proof that I will not change my mind later on and rework it again or something like that.  Oh, a shockwave? Okay. This kind of feels like a good size for the first overworld part. This is where you arrive. This would be the entrance to Course 1. And then Bunny Brushwoods would be... Also here, somewhere. Is that kind of lame? That the orbs are just kind of in the walls here? It is kind of lame. And then over there would be like a lighthouse or something. Hmm. Let me think about this. Maybe we need a cooler entrance for Course... Actually, this is only Course 1 and Course 2's entrance, right? So this is really small. The thing I worry about with this is that this scales the overworld as a whole super small. So maybe this is not ideal. Maybe we should change the shape slightly. I think that will be the right decision to make here. Yeah, right now it's one of those city carpets. They are pretty sick, aren't they? You had them at your kindergarten? I don't think we need to... We don't, Capricorn. But we need to conform to it somewhat. I don't think we need to...    And I can't just, you know, do that. So what we will be doing is we will be designing all 14 visible overworld parts at the same time. And then afterwards we will be adjusting them. Anyway, that works. It still feels huge for what it does. This would not be fun to walk around. Maybe I gotta bring the walls further in. Put the shape up a little bit, like so. Let's see. Does this lead up to Bunny Brushwoods? No, there is no lead up to Bunny Brushwoods in here yet. This is just gonna be the entrance to Course 2. This is gonna go under the volcano. Yeah, I'm making it slimmer. And then the lead up to Bunny Brushwoods. Can you send me the picture again you had for that? I think you're thinking of kind of like a mountain trail type thing. Hello, Sonic the Hedgehog. The Brushwoops. Bunny Brushwoops. And then the lead up to Course 2. By the way, two or three of you guys will be delighted to hear that Direct Mario is basically done and I will be starting beta testing. I was planning to officially make an announcement for that tomorrow. But I am looking for people to test this game now. I wanna start with five people, have them test for like one or two weeks and then add more people to the mix later on. Slowly. So we can improve the game iteratively until it's like maximized on what it does. Is anyone interested in trying the beta testers? This game is about dealing drugs and shooting people. There's a whole radio in it too. Yeah it's a very different type of fun than um normal mario 64. oh my god that's a lot of gangsters yeah i'm fucking dying you guys like the blood spatter effect when you get low hp? i like it a lot 15 fps this is because it's a this is an n64 accurate emulator no this this one's not intended for console really making them real drugs i think is a lot funnier than doing the haha mario my film is drugs type thing well i need bug testing and gameplay testing so both will be useful um the way the neon also would work that is that i would ask people to send me an email if they want to be in the testing i already have a testing server set up for it i'm just going to start uploading demos there and then hopefully in like a month or two we can release the game say now did you send me the image no where can you get that accurate emulator it is not available publicly yet yes the world is completely gone i don't know yet whether i will add luigi to this game so yeah send me send me the thing again let me actually check the dms we have here i think you sent me some images here right it was a barrel like this yes beta testing for rtyi will probably be longer i'm actually going to start beta testing for rtyi pretty soon probably right after the overworld is done or even before that and what we are going to do is we're going to send people a demo with just one level in it and then we have them play test at one level and then we improve it over and testing hello idas hello did ads question is how did you imagine this lead up here like a mountain path up here and then the brush was still somewhere here i can't no i don't think that's a good idea do you think the community of this game will be such positive for you in youtube so i'm happy to see how far you've come i think so too  well if you're lucky bingos will make like a port of it using wiseguys recompilation and then it might also be natively available on android with better frame rates than emulators would have and nicer graphics and everything so well allegedly parallel launchers supposed to work in android and i've also heard that they want to port project 64 probably to android i think dark mario works on real hardware but it's not optimized for it you might experience like half a frame per second what we could do is like a mountain track to get up here so i was thinking of this area here as dunes you know what we should set some preliminary textures here i know that this is going to lead to people thinking these are final textures and then they're going to be like case these final textures look pretty bad you should change them and i am going to get really annoyed by that but for the sake of developing the game i think i will just have to deal with people being stupid is this a song quest beta i will put it on oh it's kizuna ai i haven't listened to this yet for all i know she could just be singing slurs right now so i definitely want some verticality in here let me just think about the best way to do that so foreign so  Yes, Biobak is reworking all the levels and I have to pay him a lot for that. I hope I can make that back through donations somehow. The game as a whole is going to cost me in the tens of thousands, just so you guys know. Maybe I will start a donation drive for that or something, I don't know. Well, it's fair, Sour, because I also have a Patreon and a YouTube channel, so I do make some money. There is money to be made, I'm not making it up at all. What's your favorite Mario fan game? Super Mario and the Rainbows, because the entire game is pink, though I can't wait for it to come out. Super Mario and the Rainbow Stars? Isn't that Skelenium's romhack? Oh, it's this one. Is it this one that I was thinking of? I don't know, this one is not. Super Mario 65, the Rainbow Stars, was that it? This is what I was thinking. Wait, this is Slay Trash? Very negative! People hate this? Oh, Skelenium, of course. Of course people hate Skelenium. I don't know, Decor? That's cool, Beta. That's a good one to pick. Spring Music Composers? Expective? I was thinking I would buy the rights for the music at the end and then make an OST cartridge. But no, it's actually rare people ask for money for romhacking stuff. I know, Ham, I saw which one you meant. I'm listening to Infected Mushrooms. So, what if the way this worked is that this actually kind of wraps around here? I want this to be like a forest path, right? Dude, I wish I could get a product placement deal like that for this game. That might be the only way to monetize romhacking. I have a lot of videos planned, I'm just right now waiting for sponsors. I actually have two videos already. One of them is fully edited. I'm just waiting to be able to insert a sponsor. This is because I have an editor now. And I need to pay the editor. Apparently, it's also just a bad time to upload because, you know, monetization is kind of bad in those times. The first one is a video about every shade on Mario 64. The second one is a video about planetary gravity on Mario 64. And then what I have planned is a video that's an interview with a Mario 64 Game Boy Advance guy, talking about how he did it. And what I have planned is also a video for the new Missing Link version. There's actually a bunch of videos I have planned. I don't think I can do an April Fools video, I just don't have the time. This still feels unreasonably big for what it does. Wow. I'm not liking this, really. You don't like my not-finished, not-textured, trying-to-get-the-layout-right piece of shit? What a surprise. I suppose I could make the Yoshi as a whole a little shorter to mitigate this issue here. Can we get a new player with bunny muffins? Just wait until I have something drawn. You like the new dials? That's good. I haven't played Sunburn or Eclipse or anything like that. Kind of not interested in Sunshine Hex. I actually do not like the movement in Mario Sunshine. It's the best part of the game and I don't really like it. Mario & Mario Sunshine feels like a loaded spring. Is this awesome? I don't think so. The one thing that bothers me the most is dive rollouts. There's a one-frame difference on rolling out between you get flung completely forwards and you just slowly get up in place. The ground news is so funny. If ground news was actually being used, then there would be a huge economic incentive for people to pay ground news to falsify things. As soon as ground news is going to get popular, it is going to get bad. It's very obvious to me. Yeah, but that's because so many people ask stupid questions. So I can tell them to just pay channel points and then I will answer. Okay. I suppose I was supposed to block this with an 8, so I need a much bigger walkthrough here. No, but that's usually the people asking annoying questions about like, why does your unfinished texture look bad? Are you going to fix the Mario cap looking wrong when Mario takes his cap off? That type of thing. Okay. Okay. You teach me to not say stupid things. That's funny. You're doing all that stuff. Does that mean you're foreign to development? Yes. We basically just finished course 15, which means all the main courses are done. Now, all that's remaining is some side levels, Biobak's reworks, and the overworld. Oh, did you ask a stupid question, Sonic? In that case, it probably hurts because maybe you've got an infection. I don't know. Maybe it just does that sometimes. I can, but I won't. How do you think our test for this will look like? This is actually one thing that's a little tough for me, because I think that maybe it's not even possible to test this romhack. This is because of my new random function. I made a new random function that is faster than the one used in vanilla Mario 64. I just did it because I wanted a faster one, and I figured, like, why not? The problem is... That it kind of uses like true noise on accident so it may be impossible to test this game. Did you any of the drugs from GTA Mario? I will not disclose. One of them was beta and the other one was literally another user of the same... oh. I was thinking it'd be like a barrel here. True noise is possible. Well there is like a cycle counter register thing in the N64 and that changes a lot when like threads switch and that depends on stuff like the GFX task running and some other tasks running and random cache line interferences so literally the movement of electrons is going to affect it which is basically true noise. So but I don't actually like that it's using true noise because I would like the game to be it's just that doing it this way is more optimized so I kind of have to do it this way.  hello SM64 num 2012. I hope you're able to play this on android. I mean I can show you. Look at this you see how he does wait let me just look at how he does random animations right his first emission is d9 then this next one is let's check let's check dd let me load a safe state now the next one is de you see how it's a different one again de let's try again de df every time I load a safe state it's a different one so it's not deterministic at least not on this emulator remember you can't on the ground of curiosity shouldn't face always the four corners or is fine to have more you can have as many as you want the four corner thing is like a modern development thing and I don't actually know how good that is a lot of developments but I know it doesn't matter on the n64 I don't know if this is an emulator bug because I cannot load safe states on real hardware you know what we can do oh wait send me a friend request and why who is this anyway let's actually test this on real n64 see if it's deterministic here see I hope I can turn it off and on again e1 and df come on I love n64 oh my god can you guys shut up about the broken head texture I know I have eyes it's a broken model it's a very easy fix I'm just not doing it right now because I might just rework the model in the future d9 and then de so it's not deterministic on the n64 yeah so I think you can't test this romhack I use v for vertex scanner so what do you need me for voicel is leela acting up so let's check let's decide this does not look like a castle maybe like a mini castle I can kind of see it it's a really weird true randomization it's like the holy grail well I mean I guess it is true random like what what what am I how am I like yeah okay it just is that is it not I mean it's definitely not equal between boots best speedrunner just 10 years from now that seems like a complete toss-up as to whether people actually adopt this for speedrunning or not right now without ever having beaten the game I already mentioned like a full game speedrun to me like three and a half hours maybe at that point I feel like really really good I think I would probably like five hours actually five hours seems like a lot tough call tough call so I guess what I'm wondering is how is state of some sort being retained or loaded from boots that change the outcome it isn't extors the randomness in this game depends entirely on how many clock cycles and how many instructions have been done since booting and since the amount of clock cycle depends on stuff like loading memory which has a near random delay loading from cache that depends on how specifically the electrons move you get real world physics involved that are not like fully deterministic yes you can add reverb to a song oh wait this was supposed to be like a river here was it not it was that's gonna make this a lot less lame cool cool it's much quantum interpretation you like well the n64 given all the information the n64 has there's no prediction you could make about the real world physics there at that point which means that whether it is random or deterministic it does not matter you do not gain any predictive power vanilla does some reverb yes although I guess people would argue it's not true reverb if there is no better prediction you can make but there are hidden variables that might play into it is it randomness or is it not that is the question and I say that it doesn't matter it's the same thing is there any function just rule out rng manipulation and not testing in general well how are you gonna do a test without like knowing the rng beforehand because every time you play back the tool assisted speed run you're gonna get like a different outcome right so you're gonna have to run it back like a hundred thousand times to get one playthrough that has the same rng as the one you recorded with although I will say and this is kind of cool rng is a little less impactful in this game and I can't show you how because I'm in this overworld shit let me just show you let me show you let me show you you guys are gonna like this yeah what's a good level for this maybe here maybe the route does not depend on rng okay well if you want to do a whole 180 star run without ever touching rng good luck okay that one didn't work anyway I made it so that coins chase mario when they spawn I just can't show you because I don't have the old world set up but just trust me it's very cool yeah boss fight rng is gonna be rough to deal with in a tool assisted speed run unless someone changes the emulator to where it always gets like a valid result for rng I think something like that will be necessary which sucks but it is what it is I don't know how to run this on Wii, I don't hack Wii  the popularity of iron mario does not affect me I actually think iron mario was extremely lame and I wouldn't want to do anything like that or are you thinking of like me adding a mode where like the levels are randomized like an iron mario was like a new game plus type thing man I remember way back in the day when they first made mario 64 randomizer and it's like I had this idea for a randomizer what if I do this and most people were like well that sounds really lame like of course we've all thought about it but like we don't want to do it because it sounds like shit and then they did it and then it got really popular maybe I should have made it even though I would have hated it well it's not noise that you're feeling and you're feeling it emulation cycles that have passed so you'd have to change how that emulates I don't think it's impossible to write an emulator that does this in a way that it's consistent and would still be accurate to the real n64 well for me a randomized mario 64 and it's like there's no gameplay design to it and I mean I guess that's kind of the fun of randomizers in the ocarina of time one at least I can see like the puzzle solving aspect but that's not even there from r64 it feels like a very hollow thing to me like there's nothing to it that actually would be a vector for fun so I don't know how people like that because of movements but don't you get like more fun movement opportunities with the vanilla level layouts let me look at what Biobak sent me here he had like a cool drawing for this so got all the encryption to this talk we have like insanely encrypted secret messages in this romhack I worked on them off stream so you guys can't tell what they are even if you source code you wouldn't be able to tell what they are I think that's kind of beautiful oh I guess I lost the image so you don't need to be wrong I'm not like criticizing people for having fun with it people are free to do whatever they want it's just not what I would want to do and generally I do not like developing games that I personally wouldn't enjoy so I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing I've never played Kamex Volcano I have met Lucrecia the creator on discord though and they seem capable so I assume it's like a decent game what is a terrain randomizer like wait there's there's like mario 64 browser level thing is this it yeah this that's way cooler how do you play it I don't know this is random terrain generated this is so much cooler than r64 randomizer to me but people don't play it and you know why it's because you need to connect into the vanilla game this one's too disconnected from the vanilla game you need that anchor and that's going to connect your audience to the game it is yes I'm saying it it is youtuber bait or streamer bait  it might become infinite mario I don't know so I don't know what that means what is it terrain randomizer like Randomly generates terrain like the game i just showed you because i think i can do that i mean the code is out there if i literally just copy the code right i mean of course if it exists and the code is open source i can literally just copy the code i think basically anyone can do that that would be very cool that would be a lot cooler i think eventually we'll have like an AI trained on Mario 64 then you can just tell to generate as many levels as you want and then you can just play Mario 64 forever like that this reminds me a lot of Mario 74 this is literally exactly how it's done Mario 74 that's crazy yeah so this overworld is already a lot better now but i still don't like that there's such a long empty stretch here no it would be like it would have the same feeling as the original levels without being the original levels i think that's what you would really want so yeah does this have to be there i guess they can only be prevented with like a harsh cut i don't want the harsh cuts so i guess that is what it is no i hate this there's no way this has to be there right i'm not tripping so i mean i already made like a terrain randomizer which was desert boss 64 if you really really wanna you know be pedantic about it i think you could count that but it's not a good one but yeah something that literally generates a whole scenario to play through would be very cool although it would also be very scary because at that point you'd have just an automatically generated video game  pikmin 2 i guess pikmin 2 does that the thing about pikmin 2 though is like if you just play from pikmin 2 you would not know pikmin 2 does that you would just see a bunch of really poorly designed dungeons and that's kind of a problem is it not i think pikmin 2 is pretty bad but i heard pikmin 2 is beloved by some people so to me it's literally just completely inferior to the first one so pikmin 2 has a lot of logic to its randomization i did not know that i just know it's like a bunch of rooms snapped together which just results in an undesigned level so imagine pikmin 2 but instead of levels being randomly generated someone had gone through and spent five minutes designing each dungeon they just like changed the layout or maybe they generate the random seed until they got one that they somewhat liked the game would be better so hello Lilaa yeah i just don't see the point i guess i like there to be a hole to jump through here pikmin is quite a cool game i like pikmin a lot the first one it is one of my favorites i think  i want to make a video about all my favorite games and why they're my favorite games i think that would be a fun video it's perfect for like case clips where i can just post whatever i feel like you know i recently ran into the issue that my twitter account got so popular that i can't really shitpost on twitter anymore whatever's on my mind so i started to shitpost on linkedin instead normal linkedin shitpost stuff we ported pikmin 1 to pikmin 2's engine and take all of one's issue i have not seen that that's kind of cool did i actually port it correctly like no not full of bugs that would be crazy when i did buy this really beautiful pikmin art print at magga fest just because it was a pretty art piece interesting you should play pikmin you would like it so oh my wife has a poster from vinnie vines also spent in our living room and i don't like that post of him it feels so weird because like you know vinnie is just the guy like online to me it's like i mean i never really talked to him but i never watched him either but i know him more as a person than as like an artist and now it's just in my living room and i've never listened to the and now i have a picture of a band i've never listened to in my living room you know who he was for me i was like maybe you'll like him because he's good at what he that's funny i don't actually know what he looks like hopefully ai generated ROM hack is still out quite a while because i don't like that implication   randomly generated boss fights oh you can already get those you just need to play star revenge  now they just have a random amount of flamethrowers in the arena so here's our character in one of the many areas um no i have not completed that one yet um there is like i think 21 overworld stars in total that i need so there will be plenty of room for stuff like that i'm thinking we'll probably get a bunch of ideas still while we work on this so i haven't really set anything in stone yet and this is going to be where the mouse i gained this this would be the entrance to brushwoods this would be an entrance to that that feels a lot less oversized now that's good um i do have some art picked out yes they are in my notes but right now we're not worrying about the art part of this we're only worrying about the gameplay part right now yeah so what i have right now is um i mean i have written all the 13 parts here and then for each i have like a picture attached to it that kind of like shows what i want the feeling to be and i also have some locations there why are you going into a cave of course one it's going to be a barrel not a cave it will need to be smaller though maybe like so i do have the layout drawn out here right right here you can see like oh this is where course one is, this is where part two is, this is where course two is and if you look at this this is where the second part entrance is this is where the course one entrance is and right here would be the door to course two hello roger rabbit it runs faster most of this is not pressing buttons it's about thinking what goes where this could use another vertex here i feel like this jump is going to be awkward right off the bat which i don't like i also want to make sure that the swimming is good here because um this also kind of acts as like a swimming tutorial in a way um i do want to bring back the overworld as a tutorial area type philosophy because i think that worked really well in r64 so the story for release was like i was working on lost impact that was 2016 and i kept getting comments so like case when are you releasing this case when's release when's release case when hello and can i get the game please can i be the first beta tester please and i got so annoyed with that i was like okay fuck all of you i'm stopping work on this and i am making a game where everything is totes and it's gonna blow your ears out and i'm gonna calling this releaseo and i'm gonna take all of your stupid comments and i'm gonna put them in the game and you can read your own comments back to you and you can see all the 150 text boxes being replaced with people begging me for release dates because i get so many comments that i can literally fill up 150 or 250 or whatever i think this is a perfect swimming tutorial because it like it just works really well it feels very intuitive because it's shallow water so this feels more like a barrel now although i guess it should be protruding with some wood at top and then the condition here is weird I was very close to making the PC port really easy because so many people were asking for me to like work on the PC port. I legitimately kept getting comments like, yeah, PC port is too complicated for Gaze, he can't do it. It's like too difficult to work with it and it's like, what the fuck? There's actually nothing protruding here, it's just grass coming out. Let me look at bunny burrows here. I imagine optimizing windows is not difficult. Ooh, so it's actually more vertical than that, horizontal. You can't handle release your free travel log. Yeah, working with the PC port is just too difficult for Gaze because the PC port requires high level programming and that's too difficult for Gaze, he can only do low level, like sampling. It is what it is, man. I've already made like three release games, have I not? I really need another. Man, I hope my sponsorships go through soon so I can make more YouTube videos again. Hello, Zero. Is it going to be decided after many years from last stream? Yeah, it's pretty decided. Bowser's gonna eat a super happy fruit and turn into Yoshi Bowser, basically. Gonna be beautifully cursed. You can use public domain to save your games from copyright issues. What? What? What? It's a run like shit, even though it's a remake of an old game. I say blame Unreal Engine. I say blame Unreal Engine. I mean, I do work with Unreal Engine 5 for my day job, so I do have quite a bit of insight into this. And it is my impression that Unreal Engine just kinda is completely broken down with like extra features that most games don't use. But the support itself is already expensive. And I guess you need to know how to disable all that bullshit to really get through to something decent. People are starting to hate on the blurry rendering too, which I think is a good thing. But the blurry rendering actually helps performance. So. So. So. So. So. So.  In a world full of unoptimized piece-of-shit games, this one game runs so well and easily that it can even run on a fucking Nintendo 64. Isn't that crazy? The last game developer alive that cares about performance. The last game developer alive that cares about performance. The last game developer alive that cares about performance. Let's see how this feels. How is it in modern day to even design a GPU? Like there are 5000 ways how to build a residual. Government, you want to make your own GPU? I have no idea. I never tried. Hey, I will make engines obsolete and all games will be written in JavaScript. That's a bold read. You know what? I think we should normalize when people make claims about the future and they're like 100% certain the future will happen. We should demand proof of them that they have changed their investment strategy to where if their belief comes true, they get rich. That should be the norm. Isn't like if you don't put your mouth where your money is, then your world is worthless. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. That's how I think about these things. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually unreasonable how much I think old Pokemon is great and how much it fell off. Okay, what do you think of this as the plan for the first overworld? Of course, the graphics are not even close to being there, but I think this is a concept works. You would enter the overworld here. So the first thing you would see is the entrance to bunny brush woods. You would probably want to explore a little bit. So you might like go here some simple platforming. Nothing there because that's going to be a big gate. That's closed. And then you got this year and this is where you will learn to swim a little bit at least. This will be a closed gate until you have one star. And then this is the end already. It looks too small. What does that mean? This is one extreme house presented to the player. Think about that. I think Peaches Castle kind of works because it's very clearly presented where you're supposed to go. So in that sense it works. But before you even get here, there's going to be like a town that you move through or like not a town, but like a place where you enter your boat. So I think that's going to be what you're looking for. Don't want to presume. This is not graphics. This is gameplay. Not very pretty. Because the graphics right now are very terrible. So the idea of this is we want the player to be keen to get to the second part of the overworld, but also feel kind of stuck here until they've made some progress in the first level. Yes. There's going to be an ocean here. There's going to be an ocean here. There's going to be a dock here as well. We could have other islands in the background that would unlock bonus levels or something. That's kind of a cool effect on Mario. Hmm. Peaches Castle also changes your progress. The cannon becomes open. The more drains, the more levels you're going to unlock. Oh yeah, that's going to happen here too. But of course, this is just for in the very first course. So for example, one thing is there's going to be a lighthouse here and you can enter the lighthouse later and change the way the light works in the lighthouse to open earlier levels. The overworld is going to be very interconnected. And another thing that's going to happen is there's a secret exit from a different overworld here that you can come out from, from somewhere over there. Hmm. Run around for the sake of saving curiosity and maybe showing off to make a much stronger version with some secrets too. Hmm. I kind of see what you mean with like secret islands needing to be there in the background. Of course, there's going to be NPCs too, the Yoshi and stuff. Okay, maybe, maybe I should more explain what I'm looking for feedback on here. So this is the first, this is the first time you enter the island, right? You land here after you see the intro cutscene of the Yoshis getting abducted and Mario gets Salata to save the Yoshis. So you come here and there will be an orange Yoshi here and he will be sleeping. He's kind of going to give you the rundown of like what's going on and like, man, we need to save the guys. There's going to be a Bowser door here that you see slam down during the intro cutscene. This is going to have like a four on it and you need four stars to pass it. So right here, this is the bunny brushwoods entrance. There's going to be footsteps here of bunnies going in there. There's going to be flowers there. It's going to look like a bunny burrow. And over there, this is going to be the course to entrance, which is also locked. If you look at here, there's going to be a river here that you're swimming against and there's going to be a door locked with one star here that you need to unlock first. Then the rest of the overworld, I'm thinking like a bunch of crabs swimming around, walking around, maybe some palms, maybe some coconuts that you can kick around and maybe some islands in the background here that you can see, but maybe not reach. A large dock here for Mario's ship and Mario's ship is going to anchor here. That's the idea. So the goal for the first overworld here right now is just to build intrigue in the player to to Ignite the desire in the player to want to explore the next part of the overworld Which um, I mean you need four stars for it. So you're gonna get there pretty quickly And then you can go for here and to the next part I'm thinking maybe making the islands in the background explorable would help But i'm not sure Maybe some overworld event that happens needs to happen here Maybe at like two or three stars someone appears in the overworld and does something to you I think something like that would build a lot of intrigue because that would make the player instantly realize That the overworld is ever changing and that at any point like things can happen Then the question is what the overworld event would be Yeah, this is just rendering with transparency that makes it look like a tracer effect I think this would build intrigue in me It's too wide and feels like you are dropped right in front of two entrances I really think expanding to have further into the ocean with the one is for capturing the player's intrigue Further into the ocean wouldn't that just lead to more just walking on the floor at all. That's kind of what I want to avoid So Right in front of a castle door and like you to read you and you just walk forward It'd be more boring and seeing the castle than this is running over the hills And looking in the mode and seeing the sights finding the cannon I see what you mean So you're thinking just the one-time walk up you do Well, I guess the dock that you land on kind of helps with that So this is where my ship will be anchoring I didn't think it would be this long actually I was thinking it'd be like this length But it might have to be longer Let me just set this to wooden texture for now Doesn't need to be pretty So Let me about in dock from the beginning I'll open up here later in the game this is how you arrive here You dock your boat here So That this you can run along it not that was the opening hopper Yes, it is I could kind of see um the fun in having the first The course to here be visible at the start and this being the first thing you find And then you later find out how to get to the first level Kind of like, um, you find the second level first and then you figure out how to get to the first level To get your first star. So you feel kind of stuck at first and don't know how to get the first star I think that would pretty well be functioning All the levels are going to be hidden or almost all of them gg Many of them have like secret ways to unlock them I think the overworld is the most important part of the game. So we're putting a lot of care into this So Yeah, I kind of see how just being able to enter bunny brushwoods right away is pretty lame We want the player to find course two And then later find out to course one. How would we do this is the question I guess It seems to be more things to run around in and explore for the sake of it Hmm A more expensive beach Well, i'm just worried that this is going to be too much just running forward Because that is not fun at all So Let me try some things here see if that feels right to me  I guess that makes it feel a little bigger But I don't think it's very good either I think the problem is mainly that you can just enter quest one like that I don't want the player to feel like kind of stuck at the beginning Yes, Zelda, we're not looking for random ideas right now we're looking for ways to solve this problem So Yeah, so that's why i'm thinking building the entry could work well here If we had the player first find this level here and then afterwards find the way to enter the second the first level Which means that this would need to be closed off by default somehow and you would have to do something here to figure out How to enter it? So It's the new area you need to do it's to have more to do yeah, that's what i'm saying too That's why i'm saying we need a way that course one is closed off from the beginning and you need to do something to get there So you need to approach again you can look at some things you need to come to where You need to approach it Okay, now that's not true you can't just walk forward to get to beach's castle And falling in the mode in beaches castle kind of feels really bad Yeah, so like that's what i'm thinking too See, okay. What i'm thinking is um Maybe like on the beach here But you can't run around on the beach but what if there was like A place over here that you need to platform to in order to open up the first entrance here because I think When you land here Camera like this You're not gonna go there right away you're going to um Probably gonna run forward See that it's stuck there. Maybe get up there Maybe go in there and when you come out of there You come out of here. The camera is going to be like this And then if the platforming challenge was over there to open the first level, then that's when you would find the first level So Then right up here too big security what's over there only way to find out is to run over there I see I see what you mean. Yeah Visual obstruction is powerful Maybe we should add a visual obstruction here I think that might be a good idea. Let's try it out. See how that feels So This was going to be dune shaped anyway, so that fits we're gonna have plants on here like dunes So Determine the more you create in the morning until the left is gonna take more of this You create a little archive that might make the player want to run over it Yeah That's why I want that archive to be where you unlock the first one Because I think that's one of the last things you'll see See how this feels Okay, then that's obstructive you as intended This gives you a very clear goal to walk towards very clearly like Okay, you need to walk there And um, if this is going to be blocked, I think that's great Then while you walk at this you're gonna see that opening here And you're gonna see that's blocked too I think that makes like The feeling right and that like you're locked in the beginning of the island Something over there is a platform challenge to open course one would be perfect. I think What new player isn't going to jump into it as far as it seems from a development standpoint Yeah Yes, there's going to be palm trees around here Yeah I think what we're going to do is we're going to finish like a very rudimentary looking overworld here And then we're going to make it so that when you enter the course You just get like one star and then that one star is needed to enter the next course And there's no course in there and um We're gonna use that as like a debugging build to send to beta test us to see if the overworld works, right? You can see there's a connected dots to play a fountain no the dock is necessary for like storing reasons because you arrive here by boat Right. So you're gonna land your boat here and right next to you. There's going to be a boat here And you get out of here. So it is actually necessary that there's a dock here They're all going to be hidden dg I already answered this question So Very important that the overworld is intriguing to me. I think that's the most important aspect of this entire game You need the dog I think maybe you could Make the dock more intricate to run around on give it some paths or something leading up to the boat Maybe swing flatline. It makes it boring Yeah, this needs to be very simple this is the very first thing you do in the game I don't want the player to be jumping around on stuff here Well, actually Let me look at ship docks In the older world I had like a bunch of crates that you could stand on around here Which you know, we could do that I mean, of course we can do that. That's like a normal thing to do So there there's going to be more stuff around you, of course, this is just like the necessary parts Hello juvenile You Yes, I am on discord, uh, what's your discord name or whatever I think mine is like case three five nine one day though. Let me add you Oh I have sent you the friend request Is there an issue with this now I mean i'm curious what to see what you mean because it can't be anything like difficult or anything about At most we could have like a staircase here I don't know if we could have a staircase here  Yeah, don't worry take your time One thing i'm a little worried about is that people might figure it difficult to figure out swimming Although I think with this being so flat, it should be somewhat obvious Oh No, no If we have a way to unlock this one, which I think we need a way to do that So you can't immediately just run into it because that creates no suspense whatsoever Then it's going to be something like you have the platform and now there's only one yoshi here at the beginning So i'm getting to him is uh, I mean he's gonna be right here Yeah To give you the exposition dump that you kind of need to play the game It's mini case she is with her mama Let me think of a way to block force one here if that's even what we want to do Um, it is a barrel how would a barrel be blocked what could we do to unblock a barrel I Have landed dink. No, that's too weird from r64 That in front then. How do you unblock it from running around? That could kind of work sonic there would be a lot of ambient noise here at the beginning for sure So When you say unblocked you mean something with playing or something in the environment something in the environment My idea was that over there in that alcove There would be a place that you can climb up on it would be a very simple climb Where you press a switch or you find something that makes it so you can enter the first course That way you wouldn't land and immediately just know where to go Like I like that there is a target here for the player to be like, okay, I need to go to the target But I don't like that the player instantly can get there with like no suspense whatsoever. I want them to explore around a little first Earthquake switch that breaks the boulder. Hmm You know what I also like pecky derm The one from yoshi's story the stupid elephant that blocks the entrance What if the elephants somehow blocked it and you have to get rid of the elephants I think that would be cool Um also I need to just There needs to be an event that's two or three stars on the first world This is important to me Him listen, oh you mean pecky derm Well, Pachyderm is more like an enemy. I was thinking like a power switch or something you find. I would put a Pachyderm here and he's blocking you and you find a power switch and that opens it. Or actually, actually, actually, since you have global coins here and we need to teach the player how global coins work. It could be something like you have to find coins in the overworld and then you can pay him off to let you through. Well I guess at that point it could be a Monty Maul, but Pachyderm is so cool. On the way Pachyderm normally works is you do a ground pound and that makes him topple over. But I guess Yoshi has more power than Mario so only Yoshi would be able to do it. I guess, I don't know if that makes sense. Some textured paths here would be a cute idea, I agree. What kind of quiz do I solve? The coins will be constantly being exposed around the overworld and it needs to do simple jump and run stuff to get the coins. Yeah. Maybe that is the best way of doing it. It's very Donkey Kong 64, true. Maybe a coin toll isn't the right movement. But I'm also worried that people are going to enter the first world and then think they can get a hundred coins. So that is something I also want to avoid. There's so many considerations here to make. That's why I'm telling you guys the overworld is the most important part of the entire game. Explaining stuff through text like that is awkward, Rookie. Especially if it's like the first time you see the NPC. There's no coin stores, that is what I just said. Oh, I see a voice, so that's not a quiz I want to do at all. I don't want to ask people to waifus. I like the layout though, I think that's a good thing we have going. And I think I should increase the beach size a little bit. But not really the gameplay field, just the beach. You know what I mean? If you do not know what I mean, I guess I wasn't being very clear. No, I don't like fetch quests. Actually, no one likes fetch quests, what am I saying? Why do game designers keep putting fetch quests into their games if no one likes them? That's a good question, I think. I love doing chores. Me when chores, yippee! What missions are best quests if you think about it? No, unless you mean like you're fetching stars, I guess. I guess in that sense, yes. Fair enough. Huh? Oh. What the fuck? Oh, I forgot this. You're going to have to actually freeze a mouse, it's kind of funny and fitting. I don't know what break room is. And there's some pointless islands to run around on. I don't know if I like that island yet. Hmm. This is all such soft geometry. It's usually difficult for Mario to like, or to force Mario to do anything in soft geometry like this. Coins on top of palm trees teach how to climb. Oh yeah, there definitely should be tons of coins on this overworld here, I think. On top of palm trees, I think it's very fitting. Move shade from the cave entrance, that makes the Packy want to cool off in the ocean. I'm not even 100% sure if we use Packy Dermis here. Let's add a few palm trees first of all. Maybe that gives us a better image of this. No, I have not really played any story games. So what to trust? It's just us not having a background on the level, there is no effect. That's literally just a render bug, because we don't actually care about that right now. These fields are small to me. If I put coordinates, they need to be bigger. There we go. Could there be a lonely palm tree here? I think there should be. There we go. Oh yeah, they are just vanilla Mario 64 sprites. They don't mean anything, don't worry about those. Aw, poor guy. I kinda like the idea of forcing the player to collect like 30 points in the overworld or something before they can enter the first level. Was there any anime which you wanted to send me? Deka Delph, I think that was your name. Or am I ready to just move on? Yeah, the lonely palm tree is very much sunshine coated. Oh, that's the white trail, yeah it doesn't fade out at all, it's nasty. And the way it rotates with Mario is nasty too. Yeah, I was very wrong. I know what's going on. It's missing a VJ in an afterspawn. I think when you come back to the entrance and you have to platform to get to the current, it gives you energy to move aside. Nah, that's item fetching. No one likes fetch quests. Well, I guess coins are also a fetch quest kinda, but it's different I think. Hmm. This should have been considered beforehand. No, you can't just flood Yoshi's Island. I think this has so much potential though, this initial view. Something about it just immediately tells you where to go. It blocks the irrelevant parts, it's a nice composition. And Pachyderm is really cool too. I want Pachyderm. Hmm. What if... okay, what if the first level was not blocked by any hard requirements, but rather by the knowledge that you have to ground pound to topple over Pachyderm? That's the exact idea I'm after. Is it good enough to put the entrance here past the knowledge that you have to ground pound? Hmm. And then where would you get that knowledge, or how, I guess is the question. Maybe someone else on the island tells you about it. Hello, I'm Arch. Goodbye, I'm Arch. Good luck on your things. Where do you think you have to go? Hmm. Let's see if the crab just works. Just because the crab has such a cool vibe. Hmm. You learn all the basics, you collect those coins, then pay by Gyderm, and the ground pound can be a secret way to do it. Maybe it's just so rude when you do it. Ah, yeah. I see what you mean. But that's bad why is it doing that that's not five coordinates that feels more like 500 coordinates what the fuck oh i see you can't see my screen right now but i'm doing important work so someone just restarting the emulator sometimes doesn't work yeah the crabs are pretty nice i like them do the secret ground pound this reminds you of through the ages how what part of this is like through the ages a message in a bottle oh that's kind of cool there should just be a message in a bottle like full stop for something this should be the overworld event after you get two or three stars a message in a bottle lands here somewhere and it tells you like a secret yeah maybe it's like a secret about the island with the lonely palm and you have to do something to get like a star here i think that would work really well let me let me write that down um um message in a bottle message tells you some secret thing you have to do on the lonely palm island for a star that's good yes we are going to have variations to the palms but we're still doing gameplay this is just for the feeling i'm just doing the minimum we have to do so now i like the idea of collecting coins here i don't like the idea of the player having to jump up that palm tree right away that's a little difficult to do  i don't know what's in those yet also i don't like that there's eight coins here i think eight is too much it should be like four so i am going to change that what's the number the number is five it's not five five so not eight but four not two but one maybe it is like five so all right i reduced it to four coins i prefer this when you have free time i would like to play co-op with you i don't really just play games there is going to be a shop for coins yes well through the ages you bought stuff for stars but through the ages is a completely different game through the ages was made within the constraints of a commission someone actually paid me to make that whole game so it is a very very different style of game than i would usually make okay i think i like the coin collecting aspects so it is settled this will not be unrestricted access this will be either to run past him or pay him um it wasn't that expensive because back then my commission commission price was very small  yeah that's a cool thing isn't it the problem is when i have this feature active mario's head bugs out right now because i didn't update the model and then whenever this feature is active people in here go like case the head material is wrong did you notice that case yeah you gotta fix that before the final release or will the game just play with the bug so i usually have it disabled so  hello mr davis sorry I don't want to require the player to dive here or feel frustrated that they don't know how to dive, because the diving mechanic is not explained here, so we will not be doing that. This is a point where it's like, if someone figures out how to swim, that's great, we're  But we do not expect the player to properly understand swimming. Hello, Andy. I'm not sure if it could be an option to pick up or leeching some guys' teams. Adding that to a Romic like that in post is very difficult. Surely this is simple enough, right? Surely this is fine. Leeching via signpost feels very, very dirty to me. I don't think I want the player to be able to beat this game. Long time follower and appreciator here. I have a question. Can we play Original Mark VI with all your enhancements? There is no way to do that right now. Someone would have to port all of this back from my Romic to the vanilla game. And that just hasn't happened yet, and it's a lot of work. I know nothing about N64 capture cards. I use the Cloner Alliance one. It does bug out sometimes, but it actually does work pretty decently. Although I will say they gave it to me for free, and they were like, please make a video about this. And I said, cool, I'll definitely use this in all my videos. And then two years after that, they wrote me, hey, I'm really angry right now, you haven't made the video. And I told them I'm using this in every single one of my videos. I've shown this to over 4 million people. What are you complaining about? Can you climb the palm trees with nothing else? You can. Okay, that's kind of cool that you can't climb them normally. But then when you unlock the extended movesets, you can suddenly go up. It's like a thing that you learn as you go, I guess. I do like that. If you need 10 cards to get there, I don't want the player to be required to wall kick. These are not final trees, Sandita. They're just, it is what it is right now. Although I suppose I can just do that real quick. There you go.  Bunny brushes had a wall kicking tutorial. I think it's no longer there. Let me check. How do these work? I don't know, let's have a look up. This one should be the height. So that's at least 26. Then this one should be the radius, so that's at least 400. Yeah, so at least 20, and this should do fine. You press Z and then B, Iris. What's the character swap? That depends on the character you want. And I usually forward these commissions to someone else. Yeah, look, the wall kick tutorial is gone. It's no longer here. There have been a lot of changes since the demo. I think this area has changed the most, because a lot of you thought this was difficult. It wasn't just for the demo, it was intended to be there for the final. But during playtesting I noticed that it sucks, so I removed it. Nice, glad you like them rims. I can show you where they are right now, and I think this is a lot better. So instead of a wall kicking tutorial... ...we have a secret coin. Initially I thought the Yoshi coins should be all mostly in the main area. Because I thought this would be the most fun for people. But then I realized that that's kinda not great. Oh, it is here now. But I already have the Yoshi coin, so it makes no sense. You know what I also added? This is the coolest thing ever. Let me show you. You need absolute pro gamer skills for this one. ... That was wrong. Well, okay, wait. It is possible guys, trust me. Come on! There we go. I have added a secret blue coin here. That's all you get for that, just one blue coin. I know, e-stack revealed, I spoke to surprise. Thanks for watching! When you go back, you just die. That's what you get for jumping over there. Well, I didn't do any post-demo changes on stream, Sonic, so you wouldn't know that. I say the chat is getting hard as game. Oh no! It's hard to tell. I should be waiting in fact, even if it is like, nah, if you jump there, you're fucked up. Why'd you jump there? I was like, I'll give you a couple blue coins for spitting. They're called sidesteppers? Interesting. Of course not, no. Infinite coin flagpole glitch is something you would encounter in normal gameplay. The simple loops- no, simple loops didn't even try that. That's not a simple loops trap. GTM was the only one that tried that, and he was disappointed that the pipes weren't solid, so that's why I made them solid. It's like, if a player is disappointed that a feature isn't present, even though it looks like it could be present, then I have to make the feature present. That's kind of my rule for it. Anyway, I think I want to add more coins to this, so it is easier to find the required coins. Ideally, there would be a slow, but also easily doable way to get up here. No, Shadow Boy, you just die. You get the coins, but you die. It has to be that way. Me me me me me me me me me me. I'm going insane. Well, no one's telling you to jump there to die, Shadow Boy. That's your fault. I agree, it's my fault for not making that solid, but it's your fault for even going there in the first place. I'm not sure, Beemath. I know that the early people finding the compiler were, uh, Revol. He found the compiler that Mario64 used, and he started all the effort. It's worth it for the experience, guys, not for the blue coins. That's the idea. So, in the front, we got an example of, okay. Plankton City, however, a buff from far back on the docks. So, that is up there. Another area of the game could be fun to tease. Yeah, I see, I see. Alcove Bounty. Oh, I see a little roofing here. I'm just going to want to jump across the docks for no reason. I think that's a more fun introduction than just walking around on a dock. Make it further back, let's you see more, too. A little bit explorative, while letting you tease the areas up ahead more. Maybe more of the side when framed like this. I see what you mean. Can I frame the area like that? I think I can kind of frame it like that, but not quite. What we can do is like a harsh cut here. I think that makes it feel a little more like it's off to the side. I see the dock idea working, yeah. Also, I agree on what you're saying about the area in the background. It would be cool to see the lighthouse right away. The only thing I'm worried about is that if the lighthouse is too low, you'll actually be able to just jump up there, which I really, really need to prevent. I don't want the player to just, you know, experience reality shattering. You can try the dock thing here. Let's see how that feels. How long has this song been playing? I feel like something like this is what you imagined. The roof thing. The lighthouse shows up. What if the time changes to night? The lighthouse light is like, I can't really look. Unfortunately, all the overworld has to be at the same time of day. I think the only way we could get the lighthouse to be visible is to move this part down here. Like so. Very quick and dirty lighthouse, I know. Do not complain.  That's the most lighthouse-like patch I have right now. You know what? I'll at least give it some vertex color so it's not looking completely fucking garbage. It still looks terrible. Oh, wow. Let me see if this is visible now. Do you have a goal for when you want this project to be finished? No. Yeah, I agree with you that it would be a great thing to do, DataFox. It's just a little difficult to force that perspective here, right? Unless we go really far away. So, the game is just gonna be done when it's done. Like, there isn't much I can do about that. It's depending on a lot of external factors. Like, if I lose my job, I might get it done earlier. But there's a consideration to strip this off copyright stuff and, like, put it out as a PC game as well. So, like, everyone can just play it without needing an emulator. Open the dog donker and see how it goes. Okay, let's try it, I guess. So, did it sound like I want to lose my job, Zelda? Think for, like, half a second. Okay, Zelda, you need to redeem 50 and ask stupid questions for that one. Yeah, I mean, I guess I can move the wall even lower. Yeah, no, not really. It's gonna be possible to just jump up there at some point. What's 20 minus 21? Minus one. Why might PB come out yellow? It's supposed to do that. That just means it's working. I sure hope you redeemed ask a stupid question for that one. So, um, we could just make a hack here where it's like the camera starts here but then as you walk the camera goes to, like, a more normal perspective, like so. I think it could be cool. Well, of course, the side docks would move to the end. That's not what we were testing, though. Yeah, we do have to hide the cave. So, like so. And then we also need to hide the cave here, because I don't like that the cave is visible. So, um, of course, there's a max poly limit. Oh, well, there isn't really, but your framerate's gonna go to shit. Would a ramp up make the camera do that naturally? Um, I think so. A ramp down definitely makes it go down. But I guess a ramp up doesn't really make it go up. I think it will feel less weird once there's actually, like, stuff on the dune, like plants. You don't fall into the hub. You come here from a boat. So Mario's boat is going to anchor here and you're gonna jump out of the boat, basically. And I guess you're gonna stand with the camera. This camera is so shit, though.  I think we need to move the lighters further to the middle.  this is simply not going to work like this.  wait, no, never mind, it doesn't work. It doesn't really do much. We could move the dock to the left. Yes, you will be able to climb the lighters. That's a little nicer. Oh god. What if Mario just started high on, like, he started on this boat, which had, like, the sides. Yeah, I don't want the player to be able to do that, Zelda. Oh. We've just got off the boat, and the area he's in has a custom camera angle, like the cliff in Breath of the Wild. Yeah, we would have to do something like that. The problem is that the camera would be ass, like, this angle, that sucks to work around with. This is going to be, like, disorienting and players will automatically move it down, I think. The camera would do something like this. That scene is very un-elegant. You know what I'm also worried about? I'm worried about people falling into the water. Because we didn't explain swimming mechanics yet. People might fall in the water and just hate it instantly. I don't know if I'm sold on the long dock. The risk of falling in the lava and being frustrated is just too high. Well the problem is that players are not gonna know the swimming controls. Swimming controls in this game are very different from Mario 64. You just hold the stick in the direction. So I've seen players get stuck and just do this over and over. That's why I wanted the player's first experience with swimming to be right here. Because I think that's a lot more intuitive. The way I intended to teach swimming controls is maybe just a HUD pop-up that says stick to swim, A and B to go up or down. Kind of like how Mario Odyssey has it. I think that could work. When you jump in the water instead of running in though, that would not change anything. What do you mean? It being straight is good. That's what allows the camera to move like it's supposed to. Rope railings to prevent people from falling in, or just because they look cool. Of course we'll make changes that look cool like that. Now people will want to jump in. They're just gonna jump in while unprepared is the issue. I think there would be less of a desire to jump in if you started like here, right? Because you're gonna go, I'm already right there. But I think that's just a general issue that it's just made slightly worse with the dock. So I think what our solution should be is just pop up the controls. The controls for swimming. We could have them just pop up only here. We could literally have a cheap, cheap swim up to Mario with a sign held up that tells you the controls. That doesn't work. You're gonna press A to go to the... I think literally what we're gonna do is add a cheap, cheap that holds a sign up and the sign is gonna have the controls on it. Or would a cheap, cheap do that? You know what? What if we added a placo? I like placos. What if a placo taught you how to swim? Placos are great. You guys want to see my placo? This is my placo. I like him a lot. He's very cool. He's so big. They grow to like two foot. Alright. I'm just gonna add this to the list. There is a friendly, cheap, cheap thing in the water here that has a sign that holds up to teach you the swim controls if you are in water. Okay. Let me think more about the long dock camera thing. Yes or no? I think the answer is yes. Let me do the long dock camera thing. We start the camera something like, like this. And then as you walk, the camera is going to go up. Or if the player touches the camera, it's also just going to stay like that. What does contextual mean here? Well, I guess the answer to your question regardless of that is yes, anything is possible. We're programming a video game. Oh, it's the ugly vanilla material. I'm just going to do this for now. What the hell? Why would it do that? That was so weird. Oh shit, Mario boat. Camera tricks to look at this thing as you walk in a spot. I don't think Mario Simulator ever does that. Well, okay. The camera I have is completely different from R64's camera. I don't use a single line of code from R2. Or maybe like one or two lines of R64's camera. So I can obviously do whatever I want in that regard. Which way would a boat dock? I guess this way. This is like an old style of bodyboard from way back when. I was thinking that if you open the door on the boat you go back to the first overworld. There's going to be like a pre-overworld here where you just kind of walk towards the boat and enter it. And then you land on Yoshi's Island and I actually think the boat should be rotated 180 degrees. I guess that makes more sense with how you spawn in. Well, I think the game is going to save the last level you exited. So that they can place you appropriately. After that there's going to be a new features list. Make the game save the last level you collected to start. So it can spawn you in the appropriate overworld. Dark could be half of it's length. Okay, you don't understand why the dock is long, I guess. The dock is long so you can see the lighthouse. And we want the player to see the lighthouse so they are eager to explore more. Unless you have an alternate idea on how to set that up. Yeah, so you can't get up there and that does suck. But then it's going to be harder to see the lighthouse again. Will the opening cutscene show? Maybe the camera can fly past it before setting it behind Mario. The opening cutscene will show that Yoshi is getting abducted. But we can make it so that when you first land here it shows you the sleeping Yoshi or something. Or maybe it shows a view like this with Mario's boat arriving. I think that might be a better idea than a long dock. Because the long dock kind of sucks to walk across. To be honest. I think that's a much better way to do it. Let's try that. Well, I was going to do that with Rakaam but I don't like that. Yeah, I think a dock like this is much more reasonable actually. This is a nicer view to start off at. So we're going to show everything in the cutscene at first. We are going to... I think. I'm thinking of having the in-camera view kind of like this. That shows Mario's boat arrive here. And then as the boat arrives the camera kind of pans to something like here. And then slowly approaches behind Mario here. And then the game starts. You know how Lakitu does this little thing? It's going to be just like a 5 second cutscene. And that would show you the lighthouse. It is something I'd urge to check what's behind me upon starting. Maybe it's just a natural feeling when the view is taken up by a large wall. I'd urge to check behind you. I guess you would see there's nothing and you would see the island there. So you'd instantly have like two places to also want to explore. I think that works. Alright, let me write that down then. When you first enter this overworld, the cutscene of Mario's boat approaching the place. Then the camera rotates behind Mario. And here the lighthouse is shown in this cutscene. When the camera spins around in front of the pipe, it appears in the OG opening to show you what is around. But guides you to the castle? I think so too. And I think the cheep cheep with the control sign will be very fun. That's also like a nice way of tutorializing it, I guess. Because it's very unintrusive. And cute. I think I should add like individual coins here. Because we do actually need to add more coins to this overworld. Ech. Well, we do need the player to be able to collect 10 coins here with no prior skill. That's a lot more fun than just walking forward too. Yes, backlog. That is a thing that's going to happen. And for this overworld there is a plan that after you get two or three stars, a message in a bottle appears somewhere that you can open. And it's going to tell you how to get a secret star. What's the point of multiple hub worlds per level? There's going to be 15 parts of hub world and 15 levels, so I guess it's exactly 1 to 1. But that's more or less coincidence. The water effect. I like the splash when you jump in a little bit, but it can be improved. It's a very early VFX. From way back when. Can you do this with a backflip? You can. Alright, I think our rough plan for the first overworld works. Our next job will be to make more coins present here. And then it is time to move on to the next overworld part. We're going to leave this in a very rough state, because we are for sure 100% guaranteed to come back to this and make changes. Such is the nature of what we're doing. We're going to first get a rough draft of all 15 overworld areas. And then after we have the rough draft, we are going to be moving on to making them look nice. And to implementing the game. Actually, no. Rough draft, then the gameplay elements, then some beta testing. And then we're going to make them look nice. The lore tablets? What is a lore tablet? There's going to be a sleeping Yoshi that drops a lot of lore on you. And there's the intro cutscene where you see the Yoshis getting abducted. I think that's all the lore you need for now. The Yoshis are abducted and we need to do something. Yeah, there's 15 overworld areas. It's a big overworld. I guess the overworld is more similar to this. To Banjo-Kazooie than Mario 64 in that regard. The Banjo-Kazooie crossover is slowly getting done. Anyway, I've streamed for over 3 hours. And I'm feeling done for today. So I will see you guys in the next stream. Hopefully I can stream on Tuesday. Hopefully. We'll see. Bye!
