Hello. Anybody here? Are we live yet? Hello links, all right, it looks like we are indeed live Hello g-boy, hello agonator Hello mitsu tiger jones this fucking wild name Uh, let me just switch this hello mario nova that is exactly who it is nova Today we're working on the ice castle on the freezy here. I was really busy working on the oil level And the new video so not much progress has been made here What kind of fucked up emote is that is that front of the dinosaurs it looks like a dinosaur show with the baby You like the layout it's it's decent I think I should put like a hole in here so that when you do this the camera doesn't get fucky I think that would help this a lot I also have a change proposal for some of the physics that i'm not 100 true on That I will need the people's opinion on One of the girls from a live-action movie, oh Oh That makes sense I don't know why it crashed cool. Um any ost wishes for today What shall we listen to I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know Maybe the maricon vost Smash bros brawl ost. That's the play Oh, yeah, this is the good shit It's the best smash game Yep, brawl the best smash game It is I know you guys hate brawl, but I think it's the best smash game Sub man I joined your patreon nice being gamer. That's cool I wish I had an ice day Biobak, but it's so warm here. I can't go out because the sun will just kill you Lyrics in latin. It's house like latin Of course are we designing today we are working on course 11 at 13 the ice castle Um, I didn't show you this but I was basically done with course 11 Biobak stream work Let me just show you what we did here Okay, we need to listen to this ost for a bit All right, I don't think I showed this last week I hope I didn't So, I mean you guys know the main area here Is Hello pie, thank you pie This thing here Um Biobak didn't do this one yet I just kind of tried to do it in the style that Biobak was making the stuff but I Think you could probably make it look better Hello lila, he loves us. Taxes do lila. What do you think of the new remake of the style? Oh, hello sam Thank you sam But yeah, this is the recent area that I made Already seen it. No, but you haven't seen this. Look I invented the spline light You see how there's light coming from the spline here Isn't that fucking sick? Oh nice mark, that's good, that's good And then look at this this light you're going around me how fucking cool is that And then when you step on here there's light from below dude, it's so good And you see how the dots move depending on how the platform moves that was Biobak's idea Oh No light coming from these things Oh, I have to show you guys the funniest thing ever God I want to I I just have to show you it is technically an e-stack But dude, you guys are getting an early version of this So there's the secret path here you're not supposed to go here but there's a secret path you can enter Wait before we do this, did you guys see the camera here? Isn't that great dude the camera actually just works Have you ever seen a camera like this in a mario game unbelievable But yes, this man is powering the whole factory And he's not having a good time dude look at his face I didn't mean that that's just how the camera works But you can talk to them Huff puff can't talk. It's my turn the power the factory Wait Where did the effect go? No something's missing Did I fuck it up somehow No The effect is missing Shit, I i'll show you what I did. I don't know why the effect is missing. This really really sucks Um Here you were supposed to talk to him and then the whole room gets darker like this Dude How cool is that Thank you for the sub zina All right, let me just show you the end of the factory here, too Oh This part here is a little bit jank I think Oh, well, let me get this with the the light going red Sometimes a different thing lights up and I don't know why that's definitely a bug. I have to look into Oh But yeah, I really like this part It's fine maybe space out the amps a bit more so they can actually react So give you the damage, ah, the shock is really important for the impact of the effect I think Both has promised not to put them into one one I like that Let's see why this isn't working Well, I wanted to move on to verse 11, but we just found a bug so let's fix this one real quick You called him a hamster yeah, but I did There's no battery well, it's technically oil-powered but you know Humans are biodegradable and uh Troopers are biodegradable and um carbon net zero Belt is one of the good guys He's making sure his uh oil factory has proper renewable energy and stuff Yeah It's just not doing the thing it's not coming to function at all So How are we in this situation So You like the system I made here lila you see this you see how i've done this That's why I can add ui elements with just 0.1 microseconds of performance loss While they're inactive Yahoo Let's go Definitely on some list now for saying humans are biodegradable they are You can put me on a list for being right Wow Means you can add speed lines for free. Oh like speed lines to the screen when like Mario's running fast or something  Dilla is not biodegradable. Why not? How how is this possible I Don't understand this used to work and now it's just not being called anymore Cannons or any speedy thing. Oh, yeah, absolutely Biobak So I thought the items would actually be an impactful part of making an optimized game Uh, not really. It's just every time you check a condition on something you've kind of like waste 0.1 microseconds So if there's a lot of special cases to something you go really slow Um mario kart 64 is really terrible for this one because on mario kart 64 There's a huge switch case for every level So you have to check like 16 different things before you actually get where you want Hello skyloft I just now got the joke about Biobak being biodegradable Hello skyloft if I didn't say it yet You know what i'm doing this off stream, this is a weird one let's program the freezie What are your guys's hopes for the next smash game I want 12 characters and I want them to be like mario and bowser and link and zelda maybe fox Fox You know what I mean I just want less characters, man So Bring the racism back and remove non-mario ips you mean like the favoritism for first party games Racism is probably the worst way to say that You want micro transactions, I mean dlc kind of is a microtransaction So Oh macro transactions Oh, you mean like league of legends they recently added a 500 skin that's a macro transaction wait, where's my youtube chat I just realized my fucking youtube chat's not showing Oh my god, oh my god, I was on the wrong stream Ah, hello dawn of the dead. Hello velze. Hello bing bing wahoo Hello, i'm your cat. Hello whims. Hello don coyote God damn it. I was on the wrong youtube stream. I am very sorry for that Yeah, there's a 500 league skin That is definitely a macro transaction Okay Speaking of racism emulator second playing power versions. I don't think that is racism Um So Sweaty nerds like spending money well, the thing is a lot of sweaty nerds have a lot of Just money that they can spend on stuff because they don't really leave the house and stuff and they don't have children And they just live with their parents, you know Hello this hello hello Um Okay interact obj is not what we're looking for There is a function to check if two objects are interacting each other So Collided obj's we will find this from here Obj check if collided with object. That's what we wanted I've one plastic to my name and I just realized I don't know where the fuck he is. Where's my teddy bear? Okay, so some keys should be pronounced true So In case you suck like popsicle On the jumbo size Okay, so what we're gonna do is um, I thought pass something is sets counts down and lose money over that time So that's what we're gonna do Cigarettes I don't suck on cigarettes I Had a deal with my mom when I was a child That if I didn't smoke cigarettes until I was an adult that they would pay for my driving license Jokes on them. I didn't even want the driving license. I still got it for free Lmao how is that lmao that seems like just a good thing to do to your child And I didn't smoke a single cigarette until I was I never smoke a cigarette never in my entire life So Um, so this one nice plot and One nice block I Smoking fucks up your hormones. Oh Transphobic cigarettes true It's fine. Lila is under 18. She can have just one of those gum ones You know the gum cigarettes then you like pretend to smoke and then you just start chewing it Okay, let me check if it's actually solid now. Okay, yeah, that's good. Suddenly approaching cumshake territory, oh no, dude I'm gonna have to eat quark with milk. Do you guys have any idea how nasty that is? I don't think a normal person could eat that. It took me so long to get used to eating just raw quark. Zeina tried it once, she almost puked. 170k, wait how many points is the cumshake? Oh no, dude, no. This is gonna be the first time someone just redeemed that. Okay, well, how are we gonna do this? Did you guys see that he just redeemed that? My eyes are going crazy, am I getting schizophrenic or did he really just redeem cumshake for 200,000 points? Well, we're gonna have to make one now. Oh, we don't have any quark here. We need the quark first. Okay so, how about this? I am going to have more time off next week because of parental leave. What if I just do a bonus stream and at the beginning of the bonus stream or in the middle or something we are doing the cumshake because now I have to do it. I need the quark first, basically we're mixing 250g of quark with 250g of milk and it has the consistency of cum and it looks like cum and it probably also tastes like it, but it is extremely healthy. Keep channel recommended? Oh no, no, no, I made a post about this on Instagram today. Wait, here, my daughter will be born in four weeks, that's true, in four weeks I will have a child. That means I get time off and I will likely stream a little more and do you guys like our room? What do you think? Also she will be named Reino. This is you paper kitty or woolly hoop? But yeah, this is the daughter's room, lime green with some white, very babyish. What prediction Leela? Zeina, Reina is some Mario, Mario stuff, that's what I said too, we're doing some Mario bullshit here. I wonder what we would name it if it was a boy, like face, dace? The name of your child was going to suck? Oh, it's actually so good, yeah. We're not naming a child Gaze. Okay, so this is when he's just aiming and then when he's actually shooting an arrow it has to be slower. That is true Killdozer, I would show you, but unfortunately, let me just upload my ROM egg to the N64 real quick, which I can do with a button first now and then I boot my ROM egg here, but unfortunately right now it just crashes on boot because I fucked something up. Yeah, the graphics friend just says goodbye. Okay, show off, you like that? Do it Zeina, get your stuff working and you can hop on a call. What is the damage though? That's the first frame of the game rendering. Oh dude, yes, that's such a good idea, Viobank. We should get a captain just as a Z on it for Zeina and an R for Reyna. Oh, that is so perfect. All right, Zeina is going to be on stream for a bit. Hello? Zeina? She does not have her audio figured out. It really seems to be full feature parity with F3D. Well, F3DX performs better than F3DX3 right now for me. We always name ourselves KaZeina in video games, G-Boy. It's very fitting. Wait, I just saw you think light up Zeina. Try that again. All right, never mind. Okay, can you hear me now? Oh, wait, it's lighting up. I might have to change my settings here. Try again. Can you hear?  Okay, cool. It's working for once. Hi, chat. Been a while. All right, so the name behind Reyna is that she's named after a friend of mine that passed away when I was 12 years old. She passed away two years on her 12th birthday. Reyna is named after that person. So, yeah. This is the story. That is the story behind Reyna. Thank you, Bioback. It's not just a good homage. It's also very fitting name-wise. All right, I'm going to hop out a call and go back in chat because I don't really like being on call much. Okay. Thank you for the 45 minutes. Holy shit. 45 months, not minutes. Dude, I just hope that our daughter is not going to be one of those popular kids that thinks gamers are losers. Can you imagine if our daughter grows up thinking we're both the biggest losers on the planet? Oh, that would suck. Now I'm hoping she's like that. No! Actually, this is not a good way of doing it, now that I think about it. Because this is going to make it like a cone, but we want this to be a cylinder. I think I have the code for a cylinder head box somewhere in the windmill. This should be a tick. Oh god, all of these need to be a tick. Oh no, they're all missing the calling radius too. She will be a lovely well-rounded person, hopefully. Young girl, you will play Super Smash Bros. Brawl. No more of that going out bullshit. True. Um. Where's the wing cap stuff? Not this one. Nope. Is it this one? Nope, that's the tree top. Dude. Moon, moon, yes. Let's look for the moon. Sleep moon, there we go. Um, cylinder. Okay. They might download this. Dude, that's actually the biggest worry. Having a daughter, I think is going to be scary, because there's so many predators out there. Okay, let's record the skirmish right now. No idea. Yeah, you definitely have to teach them internet safety. But not just internet safety, real life safety even more so. Taking a guess. 470,000. Does this function just work? It does, cool. At least if it's true, the other kids want their shit. They teach modern school internet safety? I see. I don't think my daughter is allowed to date a guy that can bench less than 225. Like, that's just the base minimum. No, G-boy, you are allowed to leave, don't worry. And my daughter dating the loser, right? So if he's kind of in the radius, he is going to attack Mario. Yeah, when I grew up, there was also no internet safety at all. Who's Luca? Dude, our kid is just kind of like a Gameboy and a Henry, and they just have to live with that. No social media allowed, I think. Ask a stupid question, go ahead. Women are normally not into gaming though, just saying. Yeah, that is true. English or Spanish? English. You know a lot about Hack Me? Exactly. You can punish her by making her play Magic Wand. True. Do that and they will use social media, but without you knowing, and that's worse. That's actually a good point, yeah. Come to think of it, there was a girl in my class that was not allowed to use social media, and she would write with people via like a Pokemon forum instead. Yeah. You think it's entirely a societal problem, Biobak, and not like just a biological difference? I feel like it's probably a bit of both. It is not? There's no gaming gene? Yeah, but surely there is a difference between men and women that make people enjoy different things, right? I don't know. I'm going with you, 50% societal, 50% biological. More than that, I'm not convinced. Yes, but games? Yeah, it could be. You're saying more like 1910? Maybe. I don't have a very hard stance on this one. Okay, while opacity is set, Mario needs to be in a blocked action. Actually, before we do any of that, let's add some debug prints and then the particles so we can actually see what's going on. Okay. Hello, Betark. Pointing me about anything different still, I don't think women enjoy movies any less than men. Why would games be any different? Well, but women enjoy different movies, right? And I imagine they would also enjoy different games, and the games for women maybe just haven't really been made yet. Which I guess would also kind of be a societal issue. It is what it is. I mean, obviously you're going to enjoy different movies because you're going to have different experiences. And different movies are going to resonate with you because movies are based on resonating with the feelings you had. And you have those feelings because you grew up in a certain way. What are you talking about? I don't know, man. Just rambling, I guess. This actually needs to be elevated by half the height of the 3Z. Or, like, from this point here. 133.5. Okay, the games that women enjoy and see what all of them have in common. What are games women enjoy? Most popular games for women. I don't want to Google that. I'm going to get bullshit. It's mostly chill games with no online voice chat because you just get harassed there. Yeah? What about League of Legends? That has no voice chat. Sims? That's a stereotype. I mean, everyone gets harassed there, you know. Actually, I guess one game that I saw a lot of women like was Assassin's Creed. But it's hyper competitive, which means less to women. Yeah, exactly. That is one thing about games where I think there's a difference in agendas that is not societal. Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to spawn these in a circle and we're just going to make them go forwards. The thing is, I do need to make a particle thing here. I'm just going to start with wind particles, I think. I think men are biologically just more competitive, right? Because being competitive is an evolutionary advantage. That is more advantageous for men than for women because it's very risky. But men can have to take that risk if they want to mate. I mean you can see this in almost every species that men are more competitive Hello Yoshi party Let's start these with an opacity of a hundred decreasing over time. How old are you? 28 Did you guys see the everything What's the deal with hunting but you need to understand the size of his huge here women are kind of not raised to be the best in general It's not because of hunting there's species that don't hunt where the males are more dominant and it's like very common Or we're both genocides if you look at like betta fish I guess That's a good example Objects I I Love fishes the alpha male goldfish can change sex when needed. Really? I did not know that that is kind of sick What was this dang rave dude people would freak out over them It's literally you all right Lila is literally a goldfish you got it. I Always knew you had the brain of a goldfish I I Fuck how does this work? We have him facing this direction since plus 90 degrees is here and then we need like a whole circle around it, which I guess we can do with just Also since cause right this should literally just weren't shouldn't it And I think it's like this Foreign Sin it's sign like wine, but sign xenos It's been awesome within xenos on trigonometry to find stuntman I Prodigal object should work like that. We don't want actually we do want a random translation. I think 10 is fine And I know what I just said don't worry about it it's in the language of thinkers and let's you wouldn't get it Oh It's quite a big breath there boy I also need to that's freezing mouth lines Also, I think about it this is kind of a fucking giant radius Now a tape recoup is a baby girl What could this possibly mean I'm Google translating this Don't worry, baby Okay, what? Should break in the dodge cousin. I Did play TTYD yes, not the new one now just the old one I I can't I think you may be right it's gonna look a little poopy okay I think this is already way better need to make sure to do this in the same plane okay this is definitely too big but I mean I already said that before so should be fine um the size velocity is way too much uh actually what if we just made this negative and we made it spawn a little bigger it's like the peak fiction if it releases sure so in effect plays all that kinda extreme like a cone I can and it would be a lot less effort but I did it on purpose like this what the fuck why is it all of a sudden that direction I just think I know why you think it'd be better if it wasn't like a cylinder but rather a cone so you think I'm lying on each game looks like a couple fun I don't know I don't really have good takes this is why it was offset yes the particles were offsets you're gonna buy the array for him so it's more dangerous but also comes from one point of its mouth so it doesn't look like he summons winds all right fine I will probably make that change but before we move on to that so recently I was talking to a different game designer than salvato you might know him and he was saying that he thinks that the dive is kind of antithetical to the rest of Mario 64 the ground pop dive here he really doesn't like it and I think I kind of see his point it goes something like this in Mario 64 when you do a jump you're kind of like committed you have like a little bit of airtime thing and you can't change your angle at all you're like locked into this and on top of that it's kind of like a difficult input right a casual player isn't gonna be like oh no I missed this and then like do the dive and like save themselves it's way too difficult so the logic goes through the dive you are kinda making a lot of level design trivial and also not really having many benefits from it because bad players aren't really gonna use it to make the game easier on themselves and I can kind of see that so I was thinking maybe a better way to handle the dive which because I agree it feels really good is you can't really change your angle with it anymore so if I hold to the left from the dive now I don't get barely any forward velocity when I hold forward I get a lot and I can change my angle like slightly way up to like I think I said to run 30 degrees I think that might still feel good and be like more in line with with the rest of the game what do you think of that hello khaki def I was thinking of it before an odyssey and it was great for recovery isn't this kind of how it is in odyssey where you can slightly change the angle but not fully I think they meant the more stilted nature of the grandpa dive stilted means weakened compared to like odyssey no they explicitly wanted it removed so you know that no place can't do it it's an advanced move and it makes the game easier and faster for good players yeah I was thinking of mario 64 here in the way too that I want the game to not be difficult I want it to be like pick your own difficulty where you can go for risky jumps and like do the difficult thing or you can do the easy thing whenever you want it's kind of my thought process here yeah it just might be too easy you know because let me find a good example spot here that's been an example spot maybe I can do something here because if it's always just like this jump this jump and then like jump like that maybe that's not so good but I don't know I guess it is very fun yeah exactly my mic that is part of the worry yeah I think the nerfed dive where it's like you can't just change your angle works a little better because now you have to like do the slow poopy movement here instead of being like oh I jumped a little let me just dive turn around why not just use the original dive but you can turn around if you hold back that would feel so shit I hope it does not sound significantly better than the rest of the game because it's from like the same recording session the blood splatters I don't know what you're talking about either way let's um since we don't want this probably let's do this the other way so I just need to take the volume and pitch yeah I think it sounds kind of out of place too at first but I'm getting used to it I was thinking this gives a lot of platforming and actions and it's just fun to play we have an easy sightseeing mode where there's just no hp at all noobs can be okay but hp is not really the reason anything's difficult I think if we have a sightseeing mode like that what we should do is make mario like maybe 20% slower but also reduce gravity and jump velocity so the entire game basically plays like mario 64 maybe you get like slightly more jump heights something like that that's what I would consider a sightseeing mode here because um wasn't there the thought that maybe we'd have like different modes of playing before that we didn't really go anywhere but there was like one mode that I think would kind of work so what we need to alter the physics yeah but health is just so irrelevant so no at that point I wouldn't want modes at that point I would want the difficulty selection to be like choose your own adventure where you just play the game and then you can make more difficult jumps I think it's kind of not elegant to do it like that you know  when it equals die rl unfortunately I can't program them yet but hopefully soon one second no it's just a bunch of people liking my post maybe just a master mode but what would those do master mode is just speedrunning the game right can you do a render distance option for performance on low-end machines do we have like a low end n64 did something break in it hello xpm so give this guy a random length of time Something like this. So I think infinite recharge is better than ultimate phoenix, but lower value doesn't make bosses easier. Oh, you think the bosses are difficult? Okay, so the change from like instead of falling down you just respawn where you last stood, that would definitely make the levels a lot easier. So accessibility options maybe aren't such a bad idea. No, we're not changing the level through that casino, that's just way too much work. You can't load the map of Peach's Fury without your PC lagging? Okay, but what if you turn on limit FPS in the options in Peach's Fury? Surely that should work. What if you like bought a PC from 2005 for $15 and played your game on that one? Okay, so the problem with the add particle object is that it's gonna be using the freezies facing angle. So we might need to do a separate one. Shit. Might need to just make a new one. Fortunately, we can just kind of hack this together and have this work pretty well. Okay. Estimate minus one. Angle is not real. Angle is one. Or is it angles? Yes, angle is one. Okay, what the hell are you doing? Yes, Leela, I'm a genius, I know. I hacked together a function. Just on a 16, okay. What happened? Shit. There we go. Shit. Freezing outside needs to be passed into the last one. Oh, they might not going up and down now. I mean, you can self-impose a one-hit charge if you really want. Don't really need me programming that for you. It's not changing the angle. He's also not changing his own angle. I should probably fix that real quick. Fixed. It's cooking, just video games. Hmm. Wait, the freeze is melting out the snow to freeze you. Is this not affecting the angle like I thought it should? Oh. Well, that won't do it. Bro, stop. We get it. Okay, so they need to go a little bit faster. It needs to stop eventually. No. Looks like he's blowing the snow from his nose, kinda. Next, we need to scale the velocity with sine cosine. This is still the most correct tweet. It's a Reddit link. The new ice bomb will let you freeze demons in place in Doom Eternal. Well, we have an option to offer again and play classics like good old times. Control buttons you press. Oh, yeah. Very true. They don't slide across the floor in Mario Kart, they just stand there. Hmm. Would it make it look less like no snow if it had like a waviness instead of blowing out strength? Let's try it out then. I think it would look less like no snow if it had pitch variation to it. But yeah, just add it. Shit. What the fuck? Not at all what I wanted. Oh. This is why. Yeah. There we go. Next, we just need to make this ice. What? So I think I'm just going to take ice shards and spin them randomly. And then maybe spawn less of them. That's why there's ice shards here. These are just ripped from one of the game styles, so I don't want to use them just as is. I think we could make them look quite a bit better. Hmm. Oh God, what is this? They changed this completely. Where is that split here? Oh. There we go. What do you think about the thing that you just coded, but it won't have any charge damage attacks? Hmm. It's doable. You know what? We have the exact effect. In the T-Rex. Oh my God, do you guys remember the T-Rex? He is so cool. There is a whole ass T-Rex in this game, dude. It's crazy. Dino nose particle. Oh my God. I guess we don't need this anymore. It has been so long, dude. We still need to remake that level. Why the 9-bit bars are a faster clock rate? I mean, how much faster and how much wider are we talking? That's not a real question unless I know the numbers. I don't know. How does it auto-complete Ls into some X-Splat thing? The fuck? Hmm. Let's see if these particles work. 16-bit or 600 megahertz. Wait, what's the normal clock rate of the Remnos? I actually don't know. But 16-bit would be useless. No, 16-bit doesn't make any sense because we have 9 bits per byte here. What's it gonna do? Do half a byte? Okay. Come on, inhale. He's not inhaling. Wait, I kept the T-Rex values here. Whoops. This thing blows and it should suck. It's gonna suck, don't worry. Will the freezes hurt you if you make contact? Yes. If you see the number in the bottom left corner when I'm in the level, that's a freeze timer. I just haven't programmed Mario freezing yet. Okay, so he did inhale. That's good. But it didn't look very good. Yeah, you can see some inhaling going on here. Let me check how the dino nose particles actually work. Let's take a tick. There's a hitbox? No? Okay. You already have the iced Mario texture. Oh, we wanna use that? We can do that. I was just gonna put them in an ice block. Let's do that. To easily send an encounter into the GP on RomEx? Yep, that's pretty easy. No problem at all, actually. Okay. That's not good. Oh, because they're taking the move angle draw. Shit. So we don't need this after all? Oh, well. It doesn't make a difference. It's just one data move. For you, how is the development progress? For me as well. Can you use a texture instead of an ice cube? Kind of both. It's gonna be a bit of a visual effect. Okay, good. It's now seeming to suck in. It just needs to come from forward. The dino nose particle sucks, dude. I don't like this at all. I don't like this at all. Sending a live video of you making a level to the RomEx? Wait, you want a video of me making a level in a RomEx? I don't know about this one. I don't know about this one. This would kind of work if there was snow below. It would make it look like he's actually just sucking in the snow. I don't know about this one. I don't know about this one. Okay, so now we have a little bit of an anticipation here. He should also get bigger if we do this. I I prefer just adding the science here. So it's easier and I found if I want to edit the animation To make a thing minute what this called I made a new enemy and it sucks Row There was someone offering to make video editing for me He won $16 per minute of edited video. I'm probably taking that deal If That comes true We can make so many more videos Do my youtube output is so hard bottlenecked by my unwillingness to make videos You have no idea did F I have a whole block with video ideas that I could make and I think there's at least like 20 ideas that would be 100,000 views if I was just not so fucking spiteful of video editing. Oh No, he actually did a decent thing, let me show you You think this to me on this card on on Twitter Maybe yeah. Okay. I'll try to see you guys you guys let me know what you think of this You How do I make this bigger without boxing myself here this is what the edited I Think this is a lot better. What do you think? Thank you like to be similar to myself My engine is mostly I'm gonna be moving to one level design one of these. I know is what you give for making a collect-a-thon Stunning adventure is all about freedom where it's like you can just go through it without worrying about finding anything and Like the fun part is to just run through it. So make sure Actually, maybe don't do that. Maybe people don't like that, but I like it And how about Don't make things difficult to make them difficult Instead think about jumps that feel cool to pull off and if you need to make something Difficult and just put one of those jumps that feels cool in there It has some some boomer vibes when it is well done, okay What's your voice so quiet that's true the voice was a little quiet compared to sound effects I Too many brackets. Yeah. Well, hopefully this is the correct brackets Homogenous are humongous Homogenous And What did I do wrong I Pray the entire blender you put a spin till 2.8 degrees since 2.5 and just get fixed in 4.2 believable Homogenous means Sammy and humongous means huge I know It's the underground theme from Super Smash Bros. Brawl Well, this is the first thing that was missing here This should start at 0 or 1 I don't care Subaction is at least that So this should be a number slightly less than 1 that goes all the way up to 1 I Was just not working Let me look at this again I say so freezing during like will the breath damage yours if he's trying to pull you in what? The freezy will freeze you if the breath hits you It's gonna be sucking up snow and then just shooting it at you like that But there we go, it just works now What do you think of the VFX here He kind of reminds me of the snifits Extremely cool. Thank you. Thank you for your awesome fun We really gotta do something with this effect down here and it's just so cool Getting so definitely doesn't feel cheesy enough. Um, the cheesy style is just like whatever the fuck I can do the fastest, you know I Will say oh I like I like the bare-bones Brutalist style that you added your videos in like I like how shitty and grassroots it looks and it's like I Didn't try to make it look shitty and grassroots It just is what it is The impact should be even stronger, I mean we can easily just change that Scale up from zero to F. This makes the impact 11 to the power of 3 Divided no 1.2 to the power 3 divided by 1.1 to the power of 3 that's like 30 percent 1.3. It makes the effect like 30% stronger something like Pure guess maybe maybe 34.9 I Am googling this 1.2 to the power of 3 divided by 1.1 to the power of 3 29.8 I was really off there I Think so, you're kind of see me I'm still gonna try to keep the whole like story arcs going that I'm doing my videos. I think that's really important for the format He grows too fast at first and then just drinks too much this is weird I Mean this doesn't make a difference in the map, but I like this better create source. Oh, this might actually be Because of this Maybe not  Don't know nothing else about this game I Also if Nintendo ever sent me like a job offer or something or invited me to like present the game in Japan I would think it's a ploy to like get me arrested or like to find me and kill me They know and they're jealous, I know Don't wait You It's a spider cookie And there's no issue with honey, I'm usually just certain ones for some reason they took literally 70 of my videos down 70 They usually don't have an issue 70 of my videos say otherwise I hate the Sun did Have you ever got a thing commissioned the person who made your profile picture I Actually was pinged by someone on Twitter saying that I am using someone's profile thing and Apologize for just using it without permission because I I started using this when I was like a tournament subscribers, right? And they said it's okay. You can keep using it. I Forgot who it was though. I Should find that guy You Think you found his art station No, he wasn't getting mad about it. Someone else was pinging him Or actually multiple people were telling him I was using this as my profile picture and he was just making a tweet like yes I know And then I apologized to him if I remember this correctly No, it's my main channel one the case clips one was made by Zaino So you can be a VTuber Are you doing a stage for Mars 64? Yes, kinda I just made this game as much as gta6. Are you cook? No, okay guys Are you actually looking forward to gta6? Yes Having GTA yes, it was really fun when I was a little kid just fucking around in it, but actually playing gta6 dude No way Who can actually play gta6? Or gta5 for that matter, isn't it just like Driving around from point A to point B and then you shoot the guy and you drive again Does anyone actually like GTA Just I mean, it's the Rockstar Games patented source It's just crime do any crime I see how that's fun but like the actual single-player experience This story is good. Oh So it's about the story Yeah, my experience with GTA was that I was just playing it because it's house when I was nine or so and we would Just put in cheat code. So like fuck around with the police and then I had the game like myself at some point and It was mostly just driving around doing missions Online is what you play for. Oh, I Thought GTA online was kind of cooked Like the people on there and that was like some second life roleplay type thing where people leave way too much money Yeah Okay Hello worthy with two V's Okay, so for some reason this doesn't unleash Mario again at the end Don't quite see why but I should just see if the invincible timer is going off as intended I Think I tried to play GTA online at some point and I Think I like did a crime and got banned and then I was told that I need to like do a job and earn money and then like there was a job as a truck driver and I just Was expected to work as a truck driver in the game. I Think it was something like that I Very bizarre Hello epic legend We're talking about roleplay service, okay, I might have just did the wrong thing then when I tried to play GTA online It just that was my experience with it I Sure you went back simulator, I'm not sure How's this possible, I mean just I See what this is actually, you know what we don't even need to back this action up We can just to act freefall And then this should be fine We detect now we try to play big mother trucker Let's go That should work I Have to reset Morris velocities, too You Pictures are looking clean, we barely did anything so far. I mean, okay, we did put a lot of effort into the walls here and Dan even helped me look into this a little bit to get a proper effect going. So I am somewhat happy with it, but I think it could be a lot better. I don't think it's perfect yet. Hello, Nicholas. Ideally, I would be able to just freeze Mario's animation here. Let me think about how to best do this. What if? What if I just, ah shit, this is a bad idea with multi-threading. I was thinking of just editing the graphics thread data to like make Mario's animation have like frame one be the ending. We're in quest 13 out of 15, so we're almost done already. Well, almost done. It's probably still going to be like two years or so, I don't know. I need to freeze Mario's animation. Good ideas only. What if we use set Mario animation with acceleration and then we set the acceleration to the absolute maximum value? What would happen? You mean actual glowing? I don't think the computer that can do actual glowing has been invented yet. I think we're very far away from that amount of technology. It's just two frames now. Honestly, it looks better. Hello, Tanya, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever your name may be. The whole game freezes? I don't think so. Let's see. What else can I do here? I can't just set the animation frame to the last one. It doesn't work every frame. Yes, we add 60 FPS and there's a separate thread. Let's just return to the value. And I'm swept is active, so. Maybe we can just use a different animation. Let's do something simple first. I just put this as like a debug animation anyway. Can you translate into English for me? Yes, I can. I like that better. Have I ever eaten Fibonacci soup? I have not. Why not? I could do fog right on the gaming game with Luigi's Mansion because it was done by the image glow effect. OK, but every graphic effect so far has just been faked. No light that you've ever seen in the video game has been real. It's all fake. What if I just use a bonk animation? Like this. I think that could look good. And the next we need to make some ice charts and an ice block. Raytracing isn't as fake, it's still fake. But it's still a bit of a pain.  You think light in reality is fucking multiplicative? Come on. What if we just don't change the animation at all? I think that's what we should do. That sounds pretty nice, better. Thoughts on Mario being pushed away by the ice when we're frozen? I think the effect is stronger if Mario is like completely just frozen in time. That means, actually, you know what, the blinking is funny. The blinking is funny. I like the blinking. It's like I'm still conscious. How did I get myself into the situation? You know, on cartoons, the characters sometimes talk while being frozen in ice. It's like same vibe. Woo-hoo!   Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!  Wa! Waaa! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!  Psychiasm can default 60 FPS? If it isn't, how can I make it 60 FPS? Add 60 FPS to it. Follow for more tips. The ground is super evil coded because we didn't picture it yet. It just looks like this for now. Oh no, that's just the texture that's like doing overflow stuff. Because it's blue, so red overflow is the last. How many stars is expected to be around 175, 180, 190, 220, something like that, I don't know. I keep having new ideas for how to pad the playtime at the end. So there's going to be like, I think 130 main stars, but then there's like 45 stars I want to add to like fun. And then there would be like nine more stars I felt like I wanted to add. And then after that, I realized, man, I should add 45 more stars because I had a fun idea, you know, but probably it's going to be like 180. I think this should be opaque. Probably looks better opaque. When you can do a nice run, 200, yeah, OK, I'll let you know what my ideas is. The first we have 130 normal stars, all good. We have the nine stars extra that I first mentioned would be stars in the overworld and we need stars in the overworld. Then after that, I was thinking, well, we have these Yoshis here and there's these special Yoshi missions that kind of work like the Comets in Mario Galaxy, where there's a comet here and now there's a mission that has like a slight tweak. So that would be like, oh, you have to do this mission in 30 seconds or you have to do this mission with two A presses, stuff like that. But then after that, I was thinking, dude, you know what's fucking sick? The Emerald Hunts in Sonic Adventure 1. That should just be a thing. Those would be like the fastest 45 stars ever, like maybe free for main level, but it would be really fun if that was just an initial thing at the end. But at the same time, that's kind of like inflating the value of stars or deflating it. So maybe that should just be a Yoshi mission, like a treasure hunter mission. I think that could work. What do you guys think? Imagine you just have to find like Emerald Shards for a Yoshi. Oh, that's so cool. Now that I said that, I want this. See that's my issue. Trying to get Wonder Guns without dying in a level. I mean, that works. I'll just write the star. Alternate idea. If one of those Yoshi star ideas sucks, replace it with SA-1 Knuckles Emerald Hunt type thing. I think that's what we should do, because not all of these are good. If you look at this, find a star in this board, normal green star, I think that works. I see you get a star without touching a coin, because money is not everything in life. So this one's cringe. I don't like this. Blue, the intelligent one, he gives you a potion that changes Mario's physical in a way that affects you negatively. Go get a star with that. Yes, I think this one's good. Find a teddy bear in a level, that one could kind of work, but it's very similar to the first one. I see you need to calm down, beat something in less than X amount of jumps. That's very good. A Yoshi boyfriend is hidden in a level, go find him, he talks to you and then runs and you have to catch him. Kind of works, but not really, don't really like it, kind of cringe. Tells you to beat him in a level, asks you to do fabulous stuff, get coins, yes, this one's good. Wants you to kill stuff, cringe, gives you a riddle about a secret spot, good. Time dash for a level, good. Cheeks, starve money, try to get 100 coins without dying in a level, okay. This is formulated in a cringe way, but I think the star would be fun. Complete a star as Minamaru, yeah, that also works. That's a nice idea, complete a star as Minamaru, could just be a potion from Yoshi. 100 coin stars, this, yes, there would be 3 100 coin stars in the entire game. I think that is forgivable. 4 actually, that would be 4 100 coin stars. Be a level without collecting any coins, that is part of the list here, and I think it kind of works, but I'm not 100% sure, sold on it. So yeah, looks like it's going to be 180 stars. What about a red coin hunt, Knuckles style? No, we already have red coin stars, and the Knuckles thing was going to be something else. But I like the Knuckles hunt a lot, so that's why I want something like that. Pumpkin fields, dude, I wish I was good at repping, I would absolutely make more Knuckles reps. Yeah, 180 or like 185 or so, although it's just going to be like 170 real content stars and then like 100 bonus stars. But every content star in this game is like 3 times the size of a Mario 64 star if you think about it. So really, in Mario 64 terms, this is a 400 star hack. Do I like Mario Builder? I mean, I can't ROM make, so why would I ever play Mario Builder? I think it's well made though. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. I'm cooked. The boyfriend Yoshistar could be a thief. Yes, but we already have like the bandits and we have like the dipshits. You can already have a lot of missions where you chase people so that's why I don't like the boyfriend Yoshistar. Do yourself a favor and get a cat now if you want one. Maybe in like two or three years is what I was thinking. I hope I don't die before the game releases. Still swimming with the last thoughts running from my brain. Not model from the L undefined. Is how do the particles work that don't use a model ID? Wait a second. How did I make this work? Are they forcibly? Is this just flying squares? I think this feature should be unsupported. The hell? You know what? Non-invisible boards are not supported because not fuck. Look dumb. Mr. Mac. Well, optimization and what's for leaves? Leafs? Which leaves, Leela? Tell me. You mean in the Chris 5? No, this is an Nth mode. Yeah, they're all rendered here. Rendering them as particles would be too expensive. Here I can make some special assumptions about the notation. I think it's one exploding leaf pile. The exploding leaf pile. I that doesn't make. Oh, maybe it makes sense. Shit, that does make sense. Yeah, okay. Okay, I'm doing this. Fine. In that case, we need a new object for this. Okay, but I think I'm gonna do this off stream. Just like I'm gonna fix the light thing off screen. Yeah, I think for today I am feeling done. Which means I will be seeing you guys next week sometime. There will definitely be bonus streams at some point, but I can't really announce them beforehand. So until then, bye bye.
