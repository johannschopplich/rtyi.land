Hello? It's difficult to put my microphone in a good position nowadays. I don't know why. What happened? But it is pissing me off quite a bit. Oh, maybe this is the play. How does this work? Hello xLynx? Hello Lutra? Hello SpeedyN64? Hello Memoski? Hello Bingus? You're always here right at the start of the stream, Memoski, but then I never see you talk again. It is kind of funny. Do you just silently watch every stream, or do you just come here to say hello and then fucking leave? Hello LumaLees? Yo kings, good luck hacking today. Ayaya. Thank you. Ayaya. So we're doing more progress on part 3. Woohoo! Haha! Yah! Whoa. Wah! Woohoo! Woohoo! Woohoo! Woo! Yippee! Yah! Wah! Woohoo! Wah! Wahoo! Wah! It really is easy now. 30 stars, I want to make sure that that saves to the EEPROM properly. This looks sick. This is still supposed to look pretty poopy. It is going to look a lot better in the end. Yippee! Wah! There we go! Okay, it saves to the EEPROM. Perfect. Yahoo! The star is a little bit weird though. Let me just fix it up real quick. Yeah, see, it does this. Actually, no, this is fine. That fixes it. I think the first thing I want to do today is the water. We're going to import the same water over here. So we want to shoot our water. We need the same water. We want to shoot our low water shot to low water so that we can get a lens window. Yes, that is a good idea. I would like that, but this looks great. We need to tell the game to play. Yeah, you know what, we should change my ability. Okay. Hello, all the 64 PC. Sam Marie. Whoops. Any OSD wishes for today. I want to listen to more silly cat music. Infinite silly cat music. Do you guys hear the fan is it loud. Oh, we have the same idea. You copycat you silly copycat. It's a very specific wish. Oh, we need foggy water to. Okay. That's going to be a little weird. That's a shit ton of triangles. Holy hell. Okay, wait. Okay, that makes more sense. 11 subdivisions. I think we can do 13. If you have such specific things that you want, maybe you should just make it yourself. It's fairly unlikely that there's someone with the exact same random idea as you. Okay. Okay. What the hell. How many games do you need me to make. Can I make this one. Okay. Isn't there already a quake on N64. And I'm fairly sure there is just an N64 port of quake. And it's probably just called quake 64. You will let me finish this. Thank you for the mercy. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Not quite what I wanted. Oh, look at this. Look how cool. Oh my god, the waves are going to be perfect this way. This is beautiful. When you have your own video game, well tell me when you've become a multimillionaire and then we can talk business. Hello, SLX. Congratulations on owning the Switch. I mentioned it was a journey. Oh my god. Hello, Sarah clue. Pretty epic. I know I got you. Hello. Oh, this doesn't exist. Did I not export. Release window. No, that's the answer. No, I don't have one. You will just have to wait. If you want updates on when the release is likely, you can look at the milestone tracker document. Right here, you can see, of course, one is 100 percent, 100 percent, 100 percent, 100 percent. Beta testing is not done, puts us at 98 percent. Same here, 98, 77.5. Right. So most of these are basically finished. We are currently working on the overworld, but it's just at 47 percent right now. Yeah. Good progress is being made. One eight zero four. No, minus nine three. So we have to think about this in terms of fucked up geometry. Think about this. You have a circle here and this is the circle. But this is not really the circle we want. We want the circle to start here. So these are our values here. Origin three X. This adds one zero five point two. And then. So this is negative. Four nine six two. But that's not actually that is all. That's a good idea. How big is the circle? Like 60,000. OK, perfect. 60,000. And it's like it's still 5,000. All right. We might have a decent looking water now in part three. Message went away already. The case for this game, Fusajiro Yamauchi will rise again and shake his hand. Not if inky binky Chocobo stops him. Am I stupid or is there no height variation here? I guess I will be stupid in either case. OK, there is no height variation here. It is not doing the waves that it's supposed to. Hmm. Why? What's the angle for? Oh, I see what the angle is for. That's actually kind of sick that I programmed that. Oh, he found it in the demo. He probably doesn't know shit about video games. He doesn't even know video games are real. What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this for? Huh? Must have been debugging codes. Sanity check. Let's see if this code runs. The only thing is that he didn't really know the games either, he just played cards. Huh. OK, the function does run. It just doesn't do any height variation. I guess that means all of these are zero? Hello Leela. Dude, you guys should have seen what Leela did today. I had an issue in Fast64, Leela fixed it in two minutes. I was like going to the toilet and when I came back she was like, go get it big boy, like test the PR. Why haven't you done it yet? Yeah, one minute. OK, I see, I see. Oh, I see, in case the compiler yelled at you. Someone understood your crossmips GCC? Fair enough. I hate when that happens. Hmm. Why are we subtracting 776? This is 741 actually. Still, why are we doing that? Where is... Oh, we're using the vertex red channel to decide the height of the waves? What? I forgot about that completely. Oh my god. Sometimes the stuff I do is a little crazy. But that's N64 modding for you. So, between 1 and 15, OK. Let's start at 2. Then we go to 4. How about we go to 8? And how about we go to B? And then fuck it, we're going all the way to 15. This is such a fucked up way of doing this. You know, do you appreciate the package I was using that was just gone? That's... is that Linux? Using the red channel to decide the height of the waves is moving water? Yes! That's what all the subdivision is for. Now, Jabba Jabba did its moving inerts by just putting its waves on the sine wave. We have something like that too, but I think it's broken right now. Maybe I can show you? OK, yeah. These were also like Jabba Jabba. But, yeah. Ooh, that looks a lot better. Do you see the waves in the water now? No foamy water on the smaller islands? There... it takes a lot of time to make the foamy water in 3D. And there's a good chance Biobank will change a lot of the shapes. So doing it right now would be a huge waste of time. OK, now we have a bit of an issue, because we need this to work via fog. Because if there's no fog on here, then look what happens. Oh god, it was not meant to be like that. That is so much worse than I thought it'd be. What the hell? Why is this ship not being fogged? OK, there's some kind of issue here. This is where the strawberries do look pretty fucked up. Oh, wait, why is there black fog? Do you see that? Where is the fog coming from? It's setting my fog to zero, and it's this Mario party texture. Honestly, we might run out of ROM space soon. Arthur is doing the Quaternion format, which is going to cost a little bit more ROM space. Currently, we're working on a Quotation BVH, which is going to cost just over 1MB. Like 1.2 almost. So then we're at 61.2MB. Now I am thinking we can compress the code and engine segment. Which will give us another half megabyte, or even a full megabyte. What is Bank switching? Honestly, at the commission price he charges, I'm happy to commission him even more. Because it means, when there's stuff that I already know how to do, but I know it would take me quite a while to do, I can just commission him to do it and work on YouTube videos in the meantime. That is just so much more money efficient. There we go. OK, so this was the issue I had with the water. If we do this, the water doesn't turn white like the rest of the screen. And that's a huge issue. Do you think Bitfloats would have been better? I don't know, I compared Bitfloats to just multiplying it, and they had the same cycle count later. That's the thing. I'm not sure if FreeElement floats would be better. Yeah, FreeElement. I mean, that would be an easy change. We can just test both, that's the thing. Quaternions don't even need sine or cosine for anything? Yes, all the object movement still needs it. On all the actor stuff. It's just a lot easier to rotate actors when you have a jaw and a pitch than it is if you have to use quaternions for their rotation. Quaternions is for animations only. I don't think there was a difference. No, I posted it before. I can show you. Let me see. This wasn't. So with the Bfloat, you would LouisAT, you would get the bits, you would shift by 7, you would orient into it. Right now you have a value between 4000 and 4080. You load 1.5, you subtract 1.5, 10 cycles. The other way is you just load the float, you mtc, you convert it, you get your 1 divided by 32767, you mtc it and you multiply. Actually, I'm wrong on this. It's 12, now that I think about it. The multiplication is 5 cycles. But it's also an instruction more. That's way too big. Maybe Bfloats are... Well, I guess Bfloats are an instruction more, but also less cycles. So, eh? That's like, load, end with exponents, mtc1, subtract 3. Oh, but you lose a lot of precision doing it that way. If you load it with exponents, you have to store like, 4080. That's what I'm doing here. That's what I'm doing here. This is a fixed exponent. That's what this does. Right, and 4040 is free, it's not 1.5. I don't know why I keep calling this 1.5, it is free. What's the SLL for? To put the bits into the right position. This moves them in the correct place of the float representation. Otherwise, how do you get them high enough into a register to actually be valuable? I'm gonna check out, well, alright. Show me the script once you have it, and then I can tell you if that's correct. Now, okay, the issue with this water is, we need fog on it, but also... Like, if we just put fog on it here, it's gonna look weird, right? What's the best way to do this? And then also, if that doesn't have fog, it's also gonna look weird. What if we have two separate waterplanes, one with fog and one without? And bye bye, Sarah Klilb. Have a good time, wherever you must go. I think we have to do that. I doubt it, but maybe. The GTA guys do seem like they're up for sharing any knowledge they have, so I'm sure they would have told us, actually. Hello, I'm a Blizzy. Hello, I'm Blizzy. Hello, I'm Blizzy. Hello, I'm Blizzy. Can this blending be done like in other games, or is it too crazy? Instead of everything, I guess, just a lot of model games. Of course it can be done. The question is, can you make that performance? And I guess you can just love the quaternions like I do with animations. So, from that perspective, I would say, not too difficult. Fucking clown music. Maybe this should be singled out into a separate function, just because this is something that we will be using a couple more times. I think I will make this a function. Well, I mean, it's still two cycles less, so bfloats might be worth it regardless. I guess... No, I mean, bfloats should just work, right? How do you do... How do you do smoothing? Like, how do I generate the in-between frames of quaternions? It's a little bit of an issue for me right now. Of course they fixed opponent! I saw a point. By 8? I thought it was by 7. It should be a 7. What is this sub-sf3? Huh? Sub-sf3? Huh? Huh? Huh? Oh, I guess the compiler doesn't know it has a coprocessor1 here, and that's why it does that. Anyway, let's make this a function. Let's do it. Let's do it. Thank you for watching! This should do that. Just making sure it still works. Oh my god, how is it 2.45 already? Time flies when you're having fun, huh? Needs no breakfast coming. What's wrong with doing a Z-prepass on the answer for Schitt's and Gengar? What the hell is a Z-prepass? The answer is probably yes, but also I don't know what that is, so I cannot tell you for sure. What the hell is a Z-prepass? Did you? No, it's not. Wait, what? Oh, that's nice and clean. Too few arguments. Huh? Oh. Of course I can make the ROM bigger, that is no issue at all. The problem is, you kinda lose style points if you go beyond 64MB. All the commercial games from back in the day were 64MB or below. So, I would feel that we lose a little bit of soul if we go beyond that. You know what I mean? I kinda don't like this cave here, it's pretty boring. Hmm, let me just run it twice. First pass makes a debug, which assumes to draw the car on the second pass, which is 0 overdraw. Buffer? Okay, make the Z-buffer. Then... Then the second pass you run everything as a decal, basically. I mean, I think that should work. But you would lose decals, I guess. Unless you render decals last. Yeah, I guess that would work. Hello, NotKevin. Hmm. This should work. Hmm. There you go. All questions answered. Hmm. Oh, that's obviously an issue. Does it still work or not? I fucking can't tell. What the hell is going on? Hmm. Doesn't look like it's working. What the hell? It looks like it works exactly once. Huh? What have I done to this? Okay, so parkland. Probably. Yeah, I mean, I can see that maybe that would be a use case, but I don't know what it would be. Hmm. It looks like origin fake number here doesn't work. But was it before? Hmm. I think something's wrong with my distance decay. Hmm. Let's see how that works out. L, T, B, P. Hmm. Still doesn't work. But why? What's going on here? Hmm. Yo, banger? We're listening to this banger? Teleporter Geist? Hmm. Hmm. Bro, why is it so difficult to know whether it's working or not? Hmm. Don't tell me it's the water phase increasing that I commented out that made it not work. Hmm. Wait, this is just what it was before and it still doesn't work. Yeah. Fuck it, I guess. Hmm. I probably just have the vertex alpha very small. Yeah, it works just fine here. And it's the same coach. Huh? Oh, there's some fifteens but they're so far out that we can't see it. Got it. Hmm. That makes it darker? Okay. Okay. It was a bit far. 253? Okay, wow. Alright, now we should have more measurable waves. Hello, woofoo. Now I feel about crying about my life for two hours. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. Fair enough. What was that, nuclear bombs? Was that a donation? Was that in the music? Why did my music talk about nuclear bombs? Okay, yeah, it is very visible here, perfect. It says that in... Do you know the song well enough to say... Oh yeah, like, that's the part everyone knows, it just randomly says nuclear bombs. You know what, I believe you. Anyway, let's move on to the next thing on our part 3 list. Legalize nuclear bombs. I don't want to do this yet. Beach towels that were left behind. Alright, let's make some Yoshi beach towels. You know what, it's... Honestly... Like... Okay, let's say you're American, right? And you have a gun, so you can defend yourself against the state being terrible. Wouldn't then the logical conclusion be that you should be allowed to have nuclear bombs? Because how are you going to win against the state without nuclear bombs? Like, the laws about guns were made when guns were the strongest thing around. Like, we need to update the laws. You can also be allowed to play with nuclear bombs. Interesting. You can also be allowed to play with nuclear bombs. Interesting. Interesting. My country is garbage right now. With Cheka, and ads doing, let's not follow the constitution moment. Uh oh. Okay, nuke someone if they step on your property. You should be allowed to. There are laws. Stand your ground. Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go. We just ride, kitty ride, kitty ride, kitty roll. Pump it up, kitty. Hey DJ, play that funky beat. All the kids say, boopity-boop, to the music bump and party. Pump it, feel that kick. Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go. Here we go, here we go, here we go. Here we go, here we go, here we go. It's only fair. Dude, what the fuck am I listening to? Bro is cooking. Why is it not rendering? What, what, what the information? What the, what the man? I don't like this beat shop. Now I will lose my mind. Lose your mind, I dare you. If I didn't remember, I would call it Reason. Because surely they will listen to Reason. True. Don't worry, Nyan Cat will be over soon enough. Surely this is not going to go on for the last 70 minutes of this video. Alright, I am going to start. Oh, this is a nice alpha layer from Beach Tao. What if we combine the two? Nyanyanyanyanyanya Nyanyanyanyanyanya Nyanyanyanyanya Mmm? I'm going insane. Do you know Asgore Truck? No. What is Asgore Truck? Do I need to be scared of Asgore Truck? Is this Deltarune spoilers? Hello, Oryx? No problem, bro. Is this a song request? Is this Deltarune spoilers? Actually, I have a better idea than this. Is this Deltarune spoilers? Kind of a banger, yeah. I would agree. Is this Deltarune spoilers? Okay. Can you go with using quarter or one diamond? Sure, but it would be more obvious that the pattern repeats. Hello, Eclipse? Well, you could argue that what GCC did to my code was justified. It's the thing. So I'm honestly not very upset. Like, my mistake was not respecting the compiler enough in that video, I think. Hello, Astro Boy? How do you make an alpha layer from the alpha layer in the image in GIMP? What's the process for this? I think we own something like this. No, no, no, I want to do it in-game. I know there's just a button in-game to do it. Yes, I am trying to. I mean, I did it now, but I know there's a faster way to do it. Oops. No, no, no, I want to do it in-game. I know there's just a button in-game to do it. Yes, I am trying to. I mean, I did it now, but I know there's a faster way to do it. Oops. Huh? Where did my entire thing go? What have I done to deserve this? Why is it gone? What the hell? All I did was flip it. What the hell? There we go. Then why is it so hard to see this beach towel? I just want a towel, man. What am I doing? I'm doing well. I mean, I think this has potential. It's just... Very hard to edit right now. Is this easy for now? Oh, yeah. It's all separate. People will be like, yeah, but you're making this icon 2024. And it's like... I don't know. Nothing like the preview. And that's not what I made. How is this what I made? Huh? What do you mean? I didn't make that. What the hell, man? It's exactly like the preview. Okay, you know what? This is kind of nice. I'm inclined to accept that as a beach towel. What the fuck is going on? I'm getting killed by this. This is a flow precision issue. Did I not have an updated Fast64 render? Was that my mistake? Like, should I have just stayed on the one version that kind of worked? Really? This didn't happen last time I used it. It felt a lot more usable last time. Ah, I exported to the wrong folder. Good. Am I gonna need to give you the toggle-off color toggle? I guess? I mean... Maybe? I've been using it for a while. It's awesome to see me and my friends basing a mod on your improvements etc. That's pretty cool. I do hope people use my repository as a base for their mods. And I hope they bring improvements back to the main repository. I'd love for everyone to contribute to RGOAI once it's finally released. Alright, the beach towels are kind of nice looking. Scale 1 is nice. It's 1 to 1. Okay, I like the abandoned beach towels here. They make it look a lot more like the Yoshis are just gone. They are not. I don't think I want sand castles. Bouncy parasols. Let's add some parasols. Okay, how and what are you doing? I am making a Mario 64 mod and I am doing... Okay, why do you need to know this information? Why is my personal mood of interest here? Huh? You're trying to hack into my accounts? Let's add some more parasols from here. Let's add some more parasols from here. Let's add some more parasols from here. What have you been doing in this level? So what I'm currently doing is I'm going back to all the levels that we've already made. And I am making sure that they are 100% playable and then I'm sending them out to beta testers. So we've had so far I think 20 little tests of people just testing an individual course. And I do that so I can improve the gameplay. So that way we already have a lot of gameplay tests done before the game is ever finished. Which lets us improve the levels faster. I have to reimport all the actors. That's because Fast64 got tons of updates into bugfixes that I don't want to miss out on. Also I'm currently working on making scripts for every level that I can just execute. That export all the actors in a level at the same time. And what that will do is it will let me whenever Fast64 gets any updates or improvements I can just execute the scripts. So for that I also have to make sure everything exports fine. You need both. They work together. MIPS currently is optimal. And I'm not sure if that's because of any changes you made or because of the way we updated the model. Because now he only uses one material for his whole thing. Okay well I guess this just renders like that then. So I actually looked at the MIPS just earlier today. And here's just one texture load. But the main advantage of DX free bleeding is that it works between the actors. And that obviously is impossible for Fast64 to do. That's like an engine thing. Oh like with a material that gets set on every bone or something like that. Or like for material bone sorting. What are you making? A video game. I like that. Look at the beads. I love it. The speedrun strategy is going to be like... Yeah that has other disadvantages than I don't want to deal with. I think the current setup with DX free bleed is a lot better. And easier to make work general purpose wise. So I have no complaints about it at all. Okay well I do have complaints about this. Alright. Bouncy Parasols are here. They're tired swings. The swings are empty until you beat Bowser 1. At which point... Two Yoshi's will be swinging on them. I get your idea. I disagree that it's better for general purpose. Or well... I guess for like a bunch of shit noobs that just throw stuff together. And like have no idea of optimization. And just hit the funny export button and then hope it works well. And like use Fakir64 and never touch engine. Yeah. I think for those it's pretty awesome. Hello Jackal. I'm glad you think it looks beautiful but this is not supposed to look beautiful yet. This is still the early phases so this is going to look a lot better in the end. Okay so for this swing I had an idea. Basically when you first get here the swings they are empty. But then after you beat the first Bowser level there's Yoshi swinging on them. Yeah that would be for actors. But even for actors what I do is I sort the actors by actor type. And then when I need a material to bleed I give it like a separate layer on the actor. And then all actors bleed that material throughout all its instances. And that works just as well. Okay we're both just telling each other things we already know. Good conversation. Lovely. Okay I probably need to import this as a separate actor. And then what we're doing is we're going to manipulate the vertices of this actor here. I'm going to wait for my Mario 64 mods. Or my own game. Sorry I'm Leela's bleeding. Can't believe I'm being Leela's planes. Oh by the way Leela I found out that the asshole tree in front of my house that I have. That like sheds leaf is not actually a Leela tree. It's a Magnolia tree. Lucky you. Any day now. I'm going back to silly cat music. What do you think Zena would do if the next time she's on stream I introduce her as my current wife? Do you think I would survive? Would you use a Band-Aid sponge for your tongue? Oh no! They baby-proofed the earbuds! Oh no! Would you use a Band-Aid sponge for your tongue? Oh no! So no! Would you use a Band-Aid sponge for your tongue? Why is it so laggy? No. Why what happened? What happened? Hello? Hello? Did my stream bug out because Blenda was taking up too many resources? I like to sing it all day long. You can sing along. Happy happy happy happy! I teach you the words so you can sing along. Beautiful. Nice job! This is my happy place so I like to sing it all day long. I'll teach you the words then you can sing along. Let's try a low voice. Happy Happy Happy! Happy happy happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy happy! Great! Let's sing it again! This is my happy song, I like to sing it all day long. I'll teach you the words, then you can sing along. Let's sing it underwater! I didn't know of this part. Let's sing it underwater! Here we go again! This is my happy song, I like to sing it all day long. I'll teach you the words, then you can sing along. Let's sing it fast! Happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy happy! Faster! Happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy happy! This is my happy song! Happy happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy!

Please tell me this worked first try. Okay, I did it wrong. Okay, I did it wrong. Fuck. Or I just went too far. Does this look right for a swing? Oh, that's beautiful, I think. Yep, that works, okay. We only need to make one change. Okay, but the whole swing is moving. Really? I didn't notice. Just kidding. Okay. Okay. Okay. There you go. What do you think of my swing? It works! Yoshi's like to go crazy, I think. If we need changes, then we'll probably just have to say no to them. Okay. Oh, I went too low. Okay, so we have two Yoshis on swings, we need to give them colors. What colors are we thinking? Like, drop an RGB code? Okay, maybe we'll do this first stream. You drop an RGB code, and if it doesn't look horrible, that's what Yoshi will be. What if we had donations and it's for that? $10 and you can put your own Yoshi RGB code in the game unless it looks terrible. No submissions, so I will just mix something up. What is this playlist? Uh, Silly Cat Music. 8163, 128, that's basically grey. That's like a dirty, yeah, green, bleh. Actually, dirty blue. Bleh. No. Okay, wait, maybe you did put font into that. Are we sure on this? Ah, honestly, that's not awful. You know what? I'm putting a Yoshi in. Okay. Okay. Alright. Let's see if what we did was any good at all. Actually, one more thing we need to check. New game design position seems to be in the correct location. Wait, what the hell is going on here? Oh, I know what I did wrong. How did that not- oh, let's see. Huh? I fucked something up. Wait, what? Wait, what? Oh, I see. Wait, no, I don't see. Huh? There we go. Okay, now it makes sense. And now we're getting the broken Fast64 GO layout as expected. 51? What does that even look like? Tomorrow, Squishy's stash. Yo, Graham! It is your swing. We're right now putting Yoshis onto it, oh no. Did I link the wrong function? I did. One more screen. Yeah? What am I doing wrong? This is somehow linking to the Dummy Ride, I suppose. Alright, this really should just be working. I must have linked up something wrong. Let me just comment this stuff out for now. Oh, undefined reference to Yoshi's Swing up. Duh. I wasn't compiling, that's why it didn't work. Oh, nice, Graham. That sounds pretty exciting. Oh, I'm goated. I'm goated, it just works. You see, that's your Yoshi RGB right there. That's the one you gave me, chat member. They still need an animation, of course. And they are a little too high, but we're getting there. They're sitting weird. They are! This, unfortunately, is also an impossibility in Fast64. Leela, do you know how to do this? How do I attach the GeoASM to the Lost Throne here? Can I do this? No way, that works? Okay, nevermind, Leela, you're good. Leela, actually, there's another thing. How do I do this? How do I get rid of that? Why is it always here? I want this to be part of the Geo. I have to stack everything so it's never flat. It is never flat, what do you mean? Oh, I guess like this. But we can't just make this rotate towards the camera so easily. Okay, the Yoshis also need to rotate their body correctly. Now I see what you mean. And you are right that that looks a little weird, but I do not think that we can improve that reasonably. I'm actually not happy with my other Yoshi color. Okay, I'll put some RGBs for a Yoshi, something interesting. This one's just green and it's lame. Actually, someone said like blueish-gray, what was it? It was like 0x93 and 0x3a? Was it that? Blueish-yellow? Yeah, but they are such standard colors. We want Yoshis of all colors. Okay, how can we reasonably get the rotation? We can just use the animation frame, I guess. The Chain-Links would always face the camera. They might... Actually, no, they wouldn't be billboarded. That's not so easy. I think if Nintendo made this in the 90s, what they would do, they would put like individual little balls. And the balls would just be connected and be billboarded. And I think that would look awful. I don't know. That's why we go from 1 to 0, which is good. And then from 0 to 1, which is also good. 1, 9, F, A, C, 9. A little bit of a pinkish Yoshi. Yeah, I can see it. What have I done? How is this even possible? Oh, because I'm using timer. It's the opposite of what we want. I half expected that would happen, so I'm not too surprised. Is there 8-0, 8-0? Still doesn't look great. What if we do this? Kinda don't like that it looks like they're falling off. But I think the rest has to be done in animation. Why is that happening? That's not at all what I expected would happen. Oh yeah, it kind of makes sense, actually. I think we need to square up this result here, so... Let's see how that works. Why don't you make them part of this wing? Because then I need to import additional Yoshis. That is a lot of extra data, and then we also need to keep the Yoshi rework synchronized to this wing, which is annoying. I mean, it's better, but not great. Why would it be like this? I actually don't see it at all. Hmm? Let me think about this more. This is done when it's done. Do not bother me. It takes a while to develop a whole game. What if I take the square root of it? Would that even make sense at all? No, it wouldn't. We're squaring it, which means we have this type of curve. But it doesn't look like a squared curve is the thing. Let's debug this a moment. Yeah, the speed of the rotation just outpaces the speed of the swing all of a sudden at the end. And I'm not sure why. Wait, no, we should be taking the square root. Obviously we should be taking the square root, what the fuck am I doing? I don't think it's working on the game at all. It's still doing that. Well, I guess it comes close to 1 at the end, so that makes sense. Fuck it, we're just fucking putting in numbers and seeing what happens. Is it even compiling? What? Am I now live? What? It's like nothing I do makes a change. How? Now they should basically not be swinging at all anymore. Okay, that actually works, interestingly enough. You know what? Way better idea. This is all bullshit. Okay, there's merit to this idea. What is that? 6x5x6? That's the amount of angles there is in one rotation. Hey! That's a little closer to what we want. Sliding around a little bit. So they need an animation where they're actually swinging. Actually, they're not sliding around, really. It's just they're offset in their animation from where they swing. No, I think this is good. I think the rest needs to be changed in animation. Okay, something wrong with the position. This might be an exported tooltip. Yeah, you see that? You see how it just moved this to the side, the dots? The exporting program sometimes does that. That is not my fault. I take no blame for that one. It is literally perfectly smooth. It is a sine wave. That is literally the smoothest function possible. Something weird is going on with this. You see how it says rotation 90 degrees here? What? Yep, somehow a 90 degree rotational pitch axis happened here somewhere. Oh no, please don't tell me I have to fight that! No! Oh, that is annoying. Wait a second... It had the collision of Dory the Dinosaur, because I forgot to link this up. Two little issues. The first being the collision was offset from the export program being broken. The second is I forgot to link up the new collision. There we go. Perfect! There we go. We need to test something. Just now I stole stars for myself. The way this is supposed to work is you are supposed to beat the first Bowser level for the Yoshis to appear. So they should not be appearing right now. Makes sense. That means they didn't appear. And I also forgot to check the null pointer. Okay, it works! Yes, Froggy, like I said, this will be fixed in animation. The problem is that their animation is offset from the origin. So once we have a new animation for swinging that is actually aligned with the origin, they will no longer be flying in the air. Alright, that is going to help make this feel more alive. Alright, next would be a message in a bottle that you find the ice cap with. So there is going to be a message in a bottle that just randomly appears if you have enough stars. And you can go and read it. And it will tell you that there is treasure you can find by ground pounding some spots. There will be some sort of instruction like, oh, go here and do three backflips and then do a ground pound or whatever. And then you will find the secret entrance to the ice cap level. The boobla infestation, that will be like a little boss fight where you open Pandora's box. And then after beating Mario out of the zoo, he goes in your world and opens a stand where he sells you 1,000 coins. Okay, that's an easy one. Add some more stars, we got that. We need to program the zoo entrance, we need to program the ghost ship entrance. And we need to add the puzzle with the message in the bottle. Okay, so I think we are relatively far into platform 9. And I think this is a good point to stop the stream. So I will see you guys in the next stream, which is Saturday. Hopefully we can do the message in the bottle and maybe something else on our list. Probably start on the boobla infestation. But yeah, I'll see you then. Bye bye!
