you you hello Shelton so I think we got done with all of part one so now it is part two hello bingus you and Mario are you saying you like Pokemon games on the stream once we checked out Super Mario one it slaps I have not the thing is well I do like Pokemon I think the Pokemon game formula and just isn't very good like I don't like JRPGs I would say I like Pokemon despite being in JRPG whereas I perceive the Pokemon fangames to be like on purpose JRPGs so I expect a Pokemon fangame to not be fun for me hello Logan hello Shane that well does look sick I was working on this right before stream but it's all about working on right now this is the world how fucking cool is that it looks even cooler in level because the texture is animated you see those caustics cool assault right hello Leela what's going on we are back on to the overworld hello Benjamin there's some render errors still but we can fix them I think what changed here I'm just getting this ready for more beta testing making minor updates I guess I added more barnacles and the rocks now have like a proper CPU generated caustics texture instead of the thing it was before Oh this ice I'm missing the fuck combiner mode and I love this level like this is one of my favorite level concepts in the entire game we're also gonna change how the Yoshi coins work I'm probably also gonna rework the entire retro section retro section we have right now it's kind of bad oh god I can't make it I'm just gonna cheat let me get your your insight into this for a second so the inspiration for this is kind of the Bobby Ivor video whoa okay as I said I'm still working on this it's clearly not working right now yeah so I don't really like the retro section here too much this looks completely different from what I remember like what the fuck happened to this okay I don't remember being like this at all I must have remade it anyway I wanted to remake it again mainly what I don't like is how close the walls are this is also a little bit evil I think drug Mari release hopefully soon the guy that commissioned wrote me again but let me show you what I what I wanted to do here I saw this in this Bobby Ivor video what is going on with the voice this is not what I remember me sounding like yes you see this this is what I wanted you see how there's like the whole cave here in the background what if he made the retro section look like that Robobby what happened to your voice I'll do that yeah it is what it is with the debug warp here make you to area 2 so we can check this faster warp ff here castle grounds area 2 and this should be 3 1 but let's just double check that all one there we go you have an AI text-to-speech yep I'm going to be sad when it's done the longer division for this project has been an experience not every day you get a five-star project for the end score true you want Google to implode fair enough any OST wishes today think I'm gonna be like not Mario 64 I'm probably gonna make it not Mario 64 version of it yes I need to change the starting area if you're a character yes okay so this is our current target so this bozo mic is very cool minus this issue here I think we should make a new flamethrower VFX it just looks very bad Dorian made a flamethrower VFX that looks like a million times better than this and then of course we need to fix this warp here we're not scrapping the overworld the overworld is the most important part of the game you have no idea how much of a difference the overworld is going to make the overworld is going to take the levels from being like a 7 out of 10 to a 9 out of 10 like small particles I don't know what Dorian did exactly I gotta look at it again it looked very very good maybe she wouldn't mind giving me a hand with those effects you well that certainly would fix that there we go i think so i think retro can play this we're not something yeah there are lots of game development streamer but most of them don't actually develop this game right it's a little weird i feel like let me pull out a number out of my ass 95 percent of successful youtubers that do game creation online they don't want to be game creators they want to be youtubers so you actually like as soon as anyone gets a little bit more successful they drop the mask and just become youtubers well the game works on rmg rosa needs moopin gooey so actually i'm not sure if it works you know what why don't you go and harass the creators of those emulators instead of me i'm sure they would love fixing us they just need like a place to start i think that's true but also fine nah not fine we don't fuck with the fake homies the fake game devs we only want the real ones in here you could be making gambling videos i'm just telling you guys if there is a gambling sponsor and they offer me like 50k a video i'm doing it that's like my child's college fund right there and i hope you guys are fine with that i hope you guys can live with me just selling out if that happens and the music on this um well in the first demo i think i just stored music together in the second demo that was badoob's music do you have play minecraft i have played minecraft a little bit but then when i was playing minecraft these stupid things kept appearing and they ruined my game and then i stopped playing  where are stupid things oh the things that appear if you don't sleep i didn't know they appear if you don't sleep i just knew they were annoying as fuck phantoms yep i think that's what they were called i was playing in multiplayer so there was never a chance that we would get to sleep because both people would have to be sleeping at the same time which just never happened hello kelside the lion so all right let's fix the bowser max drawing radius oh exciting news we had another engine upgrade this one's minor we have a new decompression algorithm this is the decompression that i club imported it reduces the file size by 0.1 but it also decompresses around 15 faster so now we have less loading time um let me check how much loading time do we actually have here let's enter this one we actually do have a fair bit of loading time compared to vanilla bar 64 let's go yeah it's still a little bit i kind of wish it was less there's still an idea to reduce the loading time using uh asynchronous dma but it just crashes only on real n64 not even on iris i have summer triggered a bug that doesn't exist on iris so it doesn't at all right now uh i'm not sure what you mean sponsoring it's about multiplayer split-screen we are not sure about it yet that is the true answer i do not know android emulators so i'm not going to recommend any oh god it's one of these really old geos oh my god that is cursed so i think the design is fine it's just the geo doesn't it's not very optimized because fast 64 just doesn't like this input basically so that if a thousand will go one three six eight what if you're doing the level when neared would work on n64 no okay he's really ugly what i like him he is so mean to me so also i recently saved around half a megabyte of rom size with deleting all marie 64 actors that i'm not using or all actor groups that i'm not using so the rum is actually just not going to have any content from r64 and it left not a single thing that isn't reimported well it's already off well then i guess i am the yappa the men shark okay i'm getting old all right just wait till you get to my age i'm gonna start sounding like joe biden okay telling is fixed thank you for the five usd i am glad you're looking forward to it f3 is going to be soon not even two hours now and holy shit this music's loud oh players can be really annoying here i think i'm gonna make this have no collision up here oh points or something lame no we don't want the players to just break the game off like that the problem is that we have to limit where the players can go because you're going to be able to see other things in the overworld and we have to take advantage of the limited angles you can not overblow the polygon budget yeah basically bingos well there is still some very little that we're definitely going to stop out before release will it flavor and burn mario i think it does if you can somehow manage to reach it you have to be like oh yeah i guess you can i'm in ohio bro is an ohio this is crazy imagine being in ohio and scalimoji i'm in ohio right now is crazy we're all really sad she's in ohio it's swag pro really talks like he's from she's from 2010 when was swag i forgot millennial chorus fuck 229230 let's just do 230 so i have never played conkers bad for a day so i would not know i'm a certified conker hater ah i didn't mean to do that i don't know what i did how much time would it take to the mod for release i've been following for quite a while but get sick and stay in hospital for one year so i wasn't with the run i do not have a release timeline but we finished all the main courses and now we just need to do the overworld on some side levels greetings hey guys hello oh it's badoop thank you for the sub badoop let's just check that that works now it was a birthday on monday the guy probably never even knew i had a kid then oh what do you think of the new water ufx here except for the pop-up you can order pop-up you can order pop-up except for that what do you think i think it makes it look a lot nice and round all right how about it's gone okay now we just need to fix this part swimming leagues are in spite you cannot tell me that the vanilla ones are better they're awful okay then we need to fix this let's hold it until v2 stars okay interestingly again so that crashed yes that crashed we don't have a warp set i think 99 of crashes you'll see on the stream are very easy fixes unless i outright say that i am concerned about the crash you can just assume that it's not the thing that you should be worrying about if you were to say that this is ugly fair enough this is hideous i'm sure biomech can polish this up this is like one of the first 3d models i made when i was a kid so no one that's a little ugly so i mean just swap those out for the other ones that we use maybe not bad it would be more inspired and the chains make zero sense does it need to make sense is what i would like to ask avoid ballast it just looks stupid oh is it broken up like that is there a reason for it i don't think so so okay well they definitely need to connect to the corner but that is fair enough so there now they connect to the corner um i need the right rotation for this what if i just make him face forwards and then rotate them in level i'm sure there was a reason i didn't do it but i'm not sure that was a good reason so oh it's not oops so it's close enough hello what is f3 um that's where we showcase all the cool fangames people meet 793 what the fuck too many unique colors to fit in the ci8 so there we go wait aren't they they are rgba 32 section so so friendly man tunic seems like the type of game that i wouldn't like i just wish it didn't have these fucking atrocious loading times then i probably would have liked it but i played it on switch turned the wrong way around how did i manage that oh well not like i meant this okay let's see how this causes the warp to happen and fix that too carco used obj equals o so 0x1d it's the warp okay now the warp should work i don't think the level itself is going to work is it old theme new hadn't heard it before i think it's relatively new it's newer than the old overworld music so have you thought of doing something like that mario bros arcade mode that was scrapped from r64 could work for mold today there was a mario bros arcade mode that was scrapped from r64 also the first time i heard about this so thank you for the five bucks i appreciate it um um i've never heard of it so i never thought of it unless i thought of it without having heard of it first but in that case i don't know what you're talking about okay the one works yeah okay this is perfect don't use chan set pan mix so that will works the one works there's just one thing in the music sequence that doesn't work the composer inserted a comment that doesn't exist anymore not the composer the converter i stopped using project when would i have stopped using project 64 how'd you get that idea i have the bowser mac outside to be destroyed and smoking after you beat bowser hello zero wall yeah there's a channel set pan mix but it's very easy to fix you know what i'm gonna fix it right now just to prove that this is not a big issue because we might actually also be needing to go into the level so the way to fix this is you load the mario 64 font you import dot muse you go into the into the no items oh wait you put dot com stash asec see the entry you don't remember that come i think fast 60 or sex 64 automatically inserts it there i don't think you would ever be using their comment what that comment does is make it so that the panning you put into the game or into the channel doesn't work fully so like if you should set pan mix to zero then the panning from your song is fully what you get if you set it to 100 then you get the panning from the game instead of from your music so you never want to use it anyway that's why it's an unsupported comment because like when it's used it's a bug there were warnings okay i've never had that anyway now we export this the tech 64 is awesome yeah pan make zero so that was a comment that set the pan mix to zero which is the default value right so it's unintended who's default if it's with my tooling maybe there's also no priority comments here that we do not need oops all right okay there seem to be some errors with this i just hope it's fine so so I hate it though there's nothing wrong with it I just hate it like it's so annoying to use and sometimes my romex break on it hey see it was that easy to fix the bug oh yeah there are project 64 words that are unsafe to use that doesn't mean I don't use let me just check if this level still works man the yoshi sounds in this level are a little bit annoying those platforms are a little ugly you should probably reuse that flag in bowser 2 yep f3 is later today I really need new flamethrower gear bags I'm gonna take a look at my dory on that yeah the yoshi sounds don't seem to be proximity based which is a huge issue okay that was a little messed up okay we see that again chance that pan mix was used again another easy bug fix but I'm not doing that right now hello dawn um he won by crashing the game true okay um let's see opposite of bowser's mcboo entrance is shy and scared oh right I forgot about that let me write someone there was someone that wanted to do this as game progress love your details for all it's going pretty well we're now onto the overworld all 15 courses are done we just finished programming the first part no it was just someone let's see star powered minecart works crystals and a hole in the mineshaft okay next we need to set the swap here actually we also need to set a warp out for this level I haven't done that yet let me do that right now so we're gonna marry me goof if you go now you're gonna miss a three but I guess that is a sacrifice you're willing to make very unfortunate can I go to the levitation flow so I am not going actually no I'm not gonna go into the bowser level and do that right now because it's gonna be very long to export the level I don't know Jordan maybe possibly I mean 2026 seems very realistic to me but I don't want to say anything until I know this game has both 30 fps and 60 fps modes you can pick which one you'd like so so hey let's move on then so so I do not deal with the easy part I mean we see what is garbage but there's a good chance that this will be on the recompilation which is significantly less garbage 60f doesn't work on real n64 but of course a real n64 is going to have a lot of problems hitting that 60 fps consistently so so on a lib drillion fps that's pretty impressive recomp is static recombination and basically recompiles your n64 game into a pc game the difference between recomb and pc port really is pc port is a decomp repo that has like compiles to windows and it's like an emulator built in so you take a game you hit compile like you take a game source code the recompilation takes the game itself instead of the game source code and it recompiles it into a computer game so they basically have the same capabilities the difference is that the recompilation is a lot more well made than the pc port like the pc port right now it doesn't have support for all the shaders i'm using for example most of what you see here right now it would look wrong completely on the pc port on the recompilation they have like wise guy who is a very good programmer and dario who is a 3d rendering engineer type guy working together to make sure this is all like one-to-one accurate with how it's supposed to look on the n64 it's much more like an emulator but they're both the same amount the recomp also has like crazy modding support so when it recompiles the game it like dumps all the functions and you can override any function you want or the models even so you can create a bunch of mods that are compatible with each other um i'm not sure how finished the recon goes they want to make sure it's all good quality before they release everything the rampage instruction really i was not aware that's how it worked well i imagine if you were targeting pc from day one then working on the pc port instead of other recomposers yeah yes because when you work with the recomp you obviously go through an n64 game they were adc that's you ever heard of super mario 64 ray tracing that was made by dario who is also the person that works on the recomp i'll just make sure the warps are set up correctly right actually makes sense i forgot to set the warp here oops um this needs to go to on all the areas you know what these walls really should be per level really should be per level instead of per area this is just error prone but that's just how it works in the vanilla engine i guess but how many there are already interesting oh that's a lot wait there's five pages of this what the fuck so look i have every single mario 64 remake map around all in one that would probably be unplayable like you want all of them next to each other that could be a funny pc port project a mario 64 giga map that's like a good use for the pc port stupid shit like that i doubt a 3ds can run this game hey that works are you ready for the nastiest speedrun of all time wow cheating i'm cheating at my own game hey it works but as soon as they use the 1964 because that's the internal rom name wait this is obviously a problem the cloud pop is supposed to disappear after you're done with the level you do not keep bombs throughout the level that would make this game undesirable wow what is going on here wait what um where did the entire slide go um they're hidden but i can't make them appear do you see that so where is it it's just invisible i i need to be able to see this toggle visibility i tried that old age is not unhided uh i can unhide those so yeah i'm trying old age it doesn't work like if i hide this old age disappears safe and reopen okay so um oh that didn't work nope i can't even focus on them like i can focus on this but if i focus on this nothing happens are they like on a different layer maybe do layers like that even exist here where's the view layer what they were in a collection nope i found that there was just this collection that was disabled somehow i don't remember ever making a collection either way that means this is fine are you just saying that makes sense like you knew that could happen did i ever save the bowser gates to the new folder i did not so we probably don't want this mouser here i have never made a collection in blender ever so i don't know how a collection was there maybe the light yeah i split the lights out now i'm fine f3 is happening on youtube on the main channel um i have a premiere right now just sticking down just takes another hour right here and we got 121 people waiting i was hoping for more dang let's see how many people we get can we get 2 000 viewers on f3 i hope so i think last year we peaked at like a thousand three hundred yes i know i'm plotting a copy of an actor sucks but it's the easiest way to do it no but the stream thank you so you're being able to have three that excites you definitely there's a few that i want to play once they're out but i will not speak on it as to not influence the votes well actually there's no way that i wouldn't influence the votes just because i put the presentation together so that's not even the animation i want to do don't bother it's important you know don't do it i'm joking please don't ban me youtube we're not sad that's the last time we did when he looks at an f brain i thought it would be cool just to lose all reasoning so it's gonna be 1984 this is 1984 so so that's a broken frame maybe i'm banned from the portuguese internet so so you know what my favorite thing in the world is milkshake like the one perfect thing on earth and ice cream just had to get that out of here so have any of you guys been to restaurants lately i don't know if this is because i gained like 40 pounds of muscle or because i'm getting fucked but nowadays every time i go to a restaurant they do not give me enough food is that just normal i remember i used to go to restaurants and at the end of it like i felt like vomiting i had so much food that's like the feeling that that you're supposed to have at the end of a restaurant trip but now every time i go it's like is anyone not eating their plates like i'm hungry still and also no matter what you order they try to skimp you on the protein last time i ordered a burger i got like 30 burger 70 fries it is messed up they shouldn't be allowed to do this specifically ordered burger because i wanted the burger why is it fries rice with a side of burger you need bacon not primarily i mean i don't mind though being big is expensive this is true something about this npc is crashing my game i'm not sure what it happens as soon as they render is it a geo switch anim state that can't be there's no anim state here or no switch do my pizza steal impression from antennas infinite cheap beer and pizza just make and eat yourself is nice but sometimes other people want you to go out with them to a restaurant but my relationship with money is fucked i can like lose or gain ten thousand dollars on a stock market and it's like eh but then like i spent five dollars on like a pack of trading cards that i will have fun with and it's like the five dollars are gone i will never see them again i cannot catch up these five dollars for the rest of my life any day in the future when i look at my bank account i'm gonna be reminded that there could be five dollars more because i had fun hello mr krabs true i feel like other side yeah opposite of that. I'm not getting a switch jewel. Dude, if I can't spend $5 on a box of Pokemon cards, what makes you think I could buy a switch jewel? Like mentally, I just do not want to. Clearly, I don't need to call this first. That would be nonsense. Are we using behave mouse or W? We are. Okay, this is truly weird. We are using Castle Grounds animations. Let me try some more stuff here. Dreamteam, I have never had a wheelchair in my life until like two years ago, and I got it off of being famous on YouTube. You should not ask me for career advice. I do not know shit about career. Make a Twitter post for a free. We can make one at 3.30, yeah. You can set up a download for your kids. I suppose that might work. This is so stupid. Let's see what's actually crashing here. A video process animated part. There's anti-goon laws in the UK. Honestly, probably a good thing. I wish they banned all the thoughts of Instagram. Because sometimes I want to scroll Instagram while shitting and I don't want to see like just porn. But that's like, it's like there all the time. I block all those accounts. It doesn't stop it from showing it to me. Oh wait, 4b0. Retrieve animation index is crashing. So that means the animation point is not being set. How can that be? That cannot be. It makes no sense. You block sensitive content in settings, it doesn't work. It's different, Lila. I'm a man. There's nothing sexual about a naked male body. If there is, that's an issue for you and not for me. Bro, how many body parts does Mario have? What is going on? It didn't even crash. It didn't even crash. Now it's crashing. 0 0 0 1 8 4 6 0. I don't know. I don't want to think about it right now. Problem is they aren't using to take down protests. I think they need to take down anything. Wait, wait, wait. What are the new anti-guna laws? Maybe I don't know the new anti-guna laws. Sorry. What are these new laws? I thought it was just age verifications required for 18 plus stuff. It's your responsibility to do it. What do you mean your responsibility? You have to check yourself. What happens if you just don't do it? You know what? If it's just for porn, I'm fine with it. We don't need it. I guess. I guess there will always be unregulated stuff and it's safe, but there should be a little bit of a barrier, right? Like, aren't you tired of like being pinged pussy in bio? You know, if at least you have to seek it out. I think that's the problem with the guna stuff, right? You don't seek it out. It seeks you out. It's not just porn. Okay. That's Let's just maybe start with a null pointer. Okay, that would do it. It just starts with a null pointer entry. No wonder we had the null pointer crash. That's annoying. I don't do it to like being able to trap people, right? Like if you put bear traps out in the forest and you catch a lot of bears, I wouldn't say that the bears demand for the traps. I would say they're falling for the traps. No road to make target in bbh, leveldata.elf. What did I change in bbh? Huh? Did that make clean fails somehow? Oh my god, what's going on? To the mystery of the night, I know there is an easy way, but it is my choice anyway. You could technically protect from null pointer crashes by tapping off the pointer crash. Really? No way. That would be so helpful. Wow, if I did that, I would just spend two cycles and 8 bytes of data throughput on checking whether the thing is null. So instead of crashing, I see the animation being completely fucked up. That would be so helpful. Okay, something is fucked up here. Yo, thank you for, one second, what was that? Who just gifted to donate it? Zayna, it's Kaza time. No Yoshinois? I'm not sure when a Yoshinois happens. Anyway, why is the level not building anymore? Or why is the game not building anymore? It's actually scary. I did not touch bbh. Oh, there is a dbz shirt. You'd have to insert a renderer first. Okay, but what is happening? Has anyone paid enough attention to see how I could possibly have messed up Big Boos Haunt? Did I fuck up the makefile somehow? But there's no changes to the makefile. It was all working just a few minutes ago. I might have to go through these files one by one to see what we really changed. I've never run into this before. Okay, this is a very good change actually. Were any of these animations maybe referenced in bbh? No way, right? Okay, what's the song? Fly In The Freedom cover by Emu Emi. I'm just going to buy N64. The N64 build system here is via Linux. How's it going? It's going well, but now I'm running into this. And I don't know why. And it's very concerning. Because I cannot build the ROM anymore and I didn't change anything in bbh. Makes me think something corrupted. I mean, if it's not corrupted, then what the hell is it, right? There's something wrong, but then why would bbh break? I don't see a jingle change in my changes list that would affect that. But that's the thing. This should be fine. Not every project that's online needs to be financed. Some people just have a passion to make something. But yes, they tried to monetize it via the annoying pop-up and it does seem to work. Okay, let's just recap. It was all working and then I deleted the animations in the little mouse file and then it stopped working. That's what happened. It's literally all that happened. So what if you just remake this folder? So nope. So clearly this isn't going to delete every change I've made in the meantime, right? Hopefully. So yeah, it still doesn't work. I don't know, I feel like something must have corrupted. Wait, yeah, okay, so there are the animations. That is so annoying, what the hell? So so even the previous build doesn't build anymore. Did you see that? I can't build the build that we were building at the start of the stream anymore. Well, we're gonna post about F3. Do we need this stuff? It still shows up, okay. I don't know, something for sure corrupted. It was working before, it was working on the previous commit, now it's not working anymore. I downloaded an old build of GitHub and I diffed the files and it still didn't build. Well, I know that the old build was building, so I'm thinking something on my computer corrupted in this folder and that's why it's not working. Yes, Marty, there's plenty of usages. What if I restart WSL? Oh. I only have N64 making one version, I guess Unreal Engine. Yeah, sorry, I have no idea what the fuck to do. I think I have to just re-download my repo from Git and hope that the file corruption is the correct theory, because why else would this happen? So. Honestly, I'm not sure it's server-dyed enough. Is that a server corruption? I don't know how to do status, I don't know what it is. I just know how to program, all this tech stuff is beyond what I know. It would be this file. I mean, if I make changes to the makefile, it surely shows up here, yeah, but we know we didn't make any changes to that, so that couldn't be it. So. Git status, what would that do? What are you expecting from that? It shows you the changed files, already saw the changed files, and we already have GitHub open. And we already checked out an old commit, and that didn't work. If an old commit didn't work, then I think it doesn't matter what I change in my files, any file tracked by Git cannot be at fault. Still, we need to look at the files that are not tracked by Git. And just the build folder, which we've cleared. What the fuck is Doxygen? It's just a file that has the Mario 64 logo on it. Honestly, I might have to just restart my PC. Well, unless making clean somehow unbuild the file that I need, that is possible. Let's back up this one. So. The assets are not part of the build. So. It is totally possible that I may clean and build some files that otherwise I would have needed. So let's just go back to the video old commit. Be sure. Oh wait, that did build. Killed useless files. That seems like a sassy commit. Maybe this wasn't useless at all. Yep, it was killed useless files. Okay, very nice. I see. I killed all these segments here. So. Oh. Well, this is one I killed. So. So how was your day? We got a bit stuck. In Cloud Cave, when you enter the zone of floor reflection, I just don't have reflection on the floor. It's complicated. I'm not sure what you're talking about. In Cloud Cap Cave, I'm pretty sure you reflect off the floor in the Cloud Cap Cave. Useless files. They are useless, but they might have been required for the build somehow. So we're gonna figure that one out. Well, this certainly would affect things. Okay, that might look better for a second. Okay, menu, intro, ending. I guess I use those. Okay. These are all unused. We can kill them. These are all unused. We can kill this. We can kill that. We can kill that. Okay. Which ones of these could be, like, used? Nope. Is that T-Hit in Canada right now? Fine. What if I kill this? Nope, it still dies in BVH. Oh, but it's building a lot more now. You see how it's building all the groups? This BVH leveldata.bin, this file here. What does this file do? Has tech just been read by anything? What's the YAML file do anything, I guess, is the question. I'm guessing it does. It's pretty odd in Canada. And we need the effect segments. Well, this wouldn't affect anything, I think. I don't get it. So the easiest fix would probably be to just... Let's see if this works. Let's take this file. Do I want to add? Yep, now this builds. Yep, now this builds. Okay, so somewhere spooky is being referenced. But where? I found you! I found you, baker! See, this was a useless file that was being linked to everything all the time. So breaking it to find out where it went wrong was a very good choice. I just should have made clean instantly, so I would have found this quicker. So and I think now I just need to make clean. Please tell me I just need to make clean now. Wait, shit, okay, the guy just sent me a picture of that. Mario really did not have a reflection there. He's supposed to have one. If he doesn't have one, that's a bug right now. But I'm sure it's easy to fix. You eating? Okay, what was happening is that the segments were being linked for some reason. And I'm trying to figure out how to unlink them. You know, if I like just take this and I make a file called spooky, then BBH builds. It was building, it no longer is. So there's something here that causes that. How do you unlink this? Can we just unlink this everywhere at the same time? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Five to fifth arguments. It would be this, but this is commented. Ouch. I promise the text should be in here. Let's see. What if I remove this part? I don't really know make file, I'm just inferring shit from what I see. I have no idea if what I did was right or not. Nope, that was not the right move. Hmm, well unless I have to make main, which I never know if I do. Nope, well I know the fix, but I don't want to live with this text that's been being here my whole life. So let's see. You know what, for now we'll do something very simple here. Empty. And U32, filler, we'll do it with 0. Let's see if that works. Or we should have made teams. Oh wait, now it's just intro. Yeah, now it's just intro, then it's probably because we replaced the normal things here. Come on, please work. Intro is missing. Hello, snackers. I might just have deleted more than I needed to. Anyway, I'm fairly confident I can just fix it from here. I will probably fix this during F3. Or after. But intro is not even allowed here, is it? Of course I'm still working on it. I'm still hoping to get it announced during F3. Well, I mean, I know. Anyway, we're gonna move on to F3, so I hope I see you guys on YouTube. Please join the F3 chat. We're gonna get over there. 500 people are waiting, dude! It's gonna be exciting. So until then, bye bye!
