So we don't actually need this if we set the Arsha, good. Heckley SM64 starter pack, is that a thing MrBeast does? And we did so much progress over the last few weeks that I have like 5 case clips videos ready to go. Okay, this is near perfect now. This is kind of how I envisioned this. This is like, it feels very risky to play, I think. So it's fine if it's not super difficult, like that actually is desirable, it's not difficult. They found more, okay, well, if you sell a million products, surely there's going to be more in like one of them, right? Also, even if there was no mold in it, someone would probably put mold in it and tweet that out just to like, get the Twitter clout. So I don't know if I believe that there's mold in it, if there's mold in tons of them, okay, nevermind. If it's in all of them, nevermind what I said. It's kind of embarrassing. Oh my God, how do you just put mold in there on accident? That is so stupid. Okay, now that we have a pretty good spaces, I want to put the acceleration way down again. It's weird that they didn't follow preservatives and now they've learned why people tend to add preservatives. That reeks of like, I'm going to make this product and I know everything, unlike the other people and I'm going to just do it way better and then it's like, you don't know shit that now you made it worse. That's like Elon Musk on Twitter. Okay, regular and Roblox, okay, master. I will play regular and Roblox. That's basically exactly how I wanted this to play. That's cool. Of course, this is course 14, that's the title. Actually, no menu on YouTube. The title doesn't say shit. He destroyed his image with that KSI look at Paul collab. I thought he destroyed this image with, I don't even remember what he did, but there were like 15 videos going. It's so over for Mr. Meast. What was that about? Ooh, why are they black from here? Probably because the cam jaw and pitch is all weird. How much is left to do?  I don't know. I got to avoid getting cancer longer than Mr. Beast. I will never get cancer. All right. I'm a great person with great opinions. You want to hear one of my great opinions? I'd love to share one of my great opinions. Okay. So I wonder if I move him in the middle. Is this still going to be possible to do? Mr. Meast paid me a million dollars to make a romhack. I wouldn't do it. That would be awesome. Maybe that's how Mr. Beast can answer himself. Just pay me to make a romhack. People would love that. Oh, there we go. That's perfect. And then it stops there. So if you don't get over early, you die. Surely you can tightrope on there if you're really good. And I don't know. Arthur Tilly. I almost called you Mr. Beast. I don't know if we should talk about the TalkTour girl still. I heard recently that she's problematic and that she's now fully on the grift. Don't know if that's true. But that would be hilarious. If she went from TalkTour to be like buy my Trump Bible. Or you will go to hell. She dick rides Elon. Yeah. Fair. Did we do Mario at some point? I already read you. Didn't we do Mario? Did I not? Okay, so we need the Bowser still. We need the flap still. We need the peach to the rescue. And we wanted the zipper to hell. Another question is how do we best make the zipper open stage here? Trump or Camilla? I know zero about Camilla. Other than her skin color. That's what the marketing around her was to me. I know. Hello get it. I don't get it. Fair enough Arthur. Is it making the hell part of the laptop? By the way, everyone did. Oh my God. The Twitter monetization grind is going way better than I thought. And we hit 250k today. The fuck that's like five days worth of importance. Yes, we're making a hell of a bank of Twitter. I don't get it.   Okay. We go this way. Then it goes down on both. That's good. Because then we can just even up the like so. That was the wrong button. Yes, don't go stop. Perfect. Can't speak that last comment you wrote. Something about an Eiffel to remember. I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm just working. You'd grill me for it. Okay. Let's think about the graphic effect. So Mario needs to be able to open the zipper and fall into here. Doesn't need to be a zipper. What if it's like a piece of tape and you have to rip the piece of tape open? To like open the box. I think that would work too. I think that might actually be better and more fitting instead of a zipper. Don't want to make a Romic exhibiting random technology. That's not what I'm interested in. Yeah, it would be a cardboard flap. Just thinking about how this would work technically. Mr. B64. Why would I do that? So this is tape. And then we'd have to make like a tape roll and tape roll would have to get bigger. Right? How does it do a ball? But I wouldn't look very good from Mario to just go back with that. But a zipper feels so unfitting. Maybe if I Google cardboard box, there's some inspiration here. Yeah, this is what I was thinking at first. Just tear out four staples. I could kind of see that, yeah. Although, all four? I don't know about that. The Mario model I have right now is like an HD-ified version of the normal Mario model. Less triangles. Look, this is what he looks like. He also has new features like his nose jiggles. It's hard to see. But yeah, you can kind of see it when I'm running from here. You see that? And he's got a glove texture. And the buttons are now 3D models. And everything is more higher resolution. He's got a color line on his shoes. There's plenty of changes. True biobanker, but Twitter impressions are something we min-max. His head shape is supposed to look the same. What other ways are there to open a cardboard box? To hell. Yeah, Sunshine 2. I kind of want to pick Sunshine 2, because I feel like you can make a decent game in Sunshine. They just didn't manage to do it the first time. Whereas in Galaxy, you can't. It does do that style, or used to do that, but the feature is currently inactive, because maintaining it while I'm working on stuff is difficult. Hello, CTF. Trying to figure out how big a cardboard- Yeah, I'm trying to think of a way. The first idea Biobank had was that it would be a zipper that would be attached to here, and then you would open the zipper. But on second thought, I don't really like it. So my next idea would have been to have a piece of tape that you can pull. But... I mean, a piece of tape would work, but I'd have to make it grow. I'd have to probably add some kind of vertex animation to it. Which seems possible, but eh. Instead of peeling it off, just have it be cut. I guess cutting it would work. Pushing a knife along the box where the tape is. With a big key. I don't know if I want to put a scalpel on this map, so you can run along the line with a scalpel. I mean, it works, but... He does kind of fit the vibe. It could even be two flaps of a thing that are like this, and there's one texture in the middle that's projected over both. And then we have dynamically removed the alpha channel of it, so you can see the dark side. And then... Shoop. Past the box opener. What? What? Not much I understand this idea. I don't know, I think Mario carrying something is a little awkward. Just in general. Ideally you'd be able to open this differently somehow. Although if it is an item you have to carry, then this would be allowing it to be anywhere. You know what you mean, you just can't put words to it. Do you mean the pizza cutter? Pasta and pizza is basically the same thing. They exist in the same thought bubble. Is there a cardboard box opener? Well, there is. Holy shit. That's going to look cool. I don't know.     Now I have to think about how to do that. We can have this be one animated actor. It just keeps animating as you pull. Is it a... Yeah, I see what you mean. Okay, wait, let me see if we can make that happen. Okay. I probably want a really small strip. Just because otherwise it's going to be expensive to render. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. Ideas for the next video title. Thinking this is gonna be a video like explaining what work I made rewriting Mario 64. So my title idea so far is why I've been rewriting Mario 64 or why I am rewriting Mario 64. Question is which title will actually work out. It's five minutes. This is the Yoshi's Woolly World OST. It's an actual Nintendo game OST. It's not on me. Nintendo made this. All right. You're insulting some poor Japanese man that's just doing his job. Just replacing it with his old code. But I feel like that's not interesting as a title enough. So everything I really make. Look, they weren't just doing their job, but they were doing it poorly. I like why I've been there. Well, but why I also is like being active, right? It gets longer as you pull it. It gets longer as you pull it. What? Really? Really? Look. It's going to run at the end. It gets longer as he walks backwards. Oh, you mean this piece here at the end gets longer as you pull it? Yes, that's true. But is that even a good title? Yes. Did you enable the three month Nitro thing? I don't know what that is. Okay. I think we need more segments realistically to make this work at all. Which sucks. So I think we make this as short as possible. But it's going to be less satisfying if it's so short. How can I make this long without it being expensive? Either more segments are thinner. I mean, thin and long kind of works, I guess. The problem is, this needs to be basically the start state. Otherwise, how small are you even pulling it? Right? Or is something like this the start state? And you have it here. I guess it would be fine if Mario grabs it from here. We just teleport him to the other side. It's going to look weird, but it's going to make the gameplay that much better. And then, oh god, do I have to watch videos on how this is done again? Would it be like this? That seems problematic. It wouldn't be, right? How would this work out? What if I make this way thinner? What if I make it two-dimensional? We need like a goal height where Maru is actually going to be pulling it at and it should be like 100 coordinates off the floor. Would it pull like this? Yes, I am a German living in Canada. Germany is the worst country to live in in the entire world. Maybe not the very worst, but it's in my top 10 list for sure. I don't think German engineering has been the best in a long time. I don't think German engineering has been the best in a long time. Let's see. The end looks good. The beginning looks a little shoddy. Like I like this. This is fine. It shouldn't be so high up. Stop asking me when the release date is fine. Hör auf mich zu fragen, wo das Spiel rauskommt, du Hund, du Affe, du Spast, I don't know. I can't say anything too bad. Looks great. I like how it looks, but I think the speed needs to be a little more consistent. This is true. Mario Maker 64 did release a long time ago. I did want to do Mario 64 X-Men Drossmask at some point, but I never formally started it. Yeah. 1174 coordinates. If it's 1174 coordinates, why don't we make it easy and just say we spread this over this many animation frames. Ah, I didn't select all of them. So, this needs to be 17 frames in, needs to be there. Oh boy. Wait, no, that's 15 frames. This is where 29 frames needs to end up. We should do it the other way around. We should just figure out where the frame is. That's 400, so that should be frame 40. And frame 59 should be 190 further. Okay, that's pretty accurate. Good. Frame 73 should be 140 units further. Okay, that's too early. No, wait, we did it the other way around again. 35, so frame... I forgot the number. 764, so frame 76. Got it. 76, 185, frame 95. This should be frame 95. It's 9 frames further, so this should be 104. That's fine. All right, now it should be a mostly consistent speed, I think. All right. What courses did you take while developing your Robocraft? Wait, what courses did I take? In university? I studied mathematics in university, so it was mostly analysis, linear algebra, functional analysis, topology, stuff like that. Normal algebra. So, we don't actually want this. We want a box that you can open. I don't have the screenshot from Biobank open anymore. Oh, well. I need to change the model then. So, there gotta be ETH on here, right? Let me see if I can find this on my history. I found it. Yeah, we need to put teeth on these. Change the water to ground? Yeah. Let me actually... This is the funniest thing ever. Do you remember how I said that the stage runs poorly and we need to make sure... We need to make the budget cuts. The reason it ran poorly is because back from my other RoMac, I still had the drawing distance for everything set at infinite. So, if you look at it now, it's... Let me turn these off. It runs a lot better. Okay, well, it's still not great, but it's a lot more acceptable now. I also think the floor looks a lot better now. And I made the mountains with one material instead of two for the decal there. Which is gonna have a lot more implications for good performance. Let me go before I land it. But yeah, the performance is now mostly fine. I really like the swamp. Man, I can't wait to add the music to this area. It's gonna make everything here so much nicer. Will the rider be at the edge? Maybe? The darker water is always far away from land. But isn't that exactly how this works now, actually? I mean, you're contradicting yourself. You think the land is at the edge, away from the stage? I don't think so. My only concern about the floor is that it doesn't look crafty enough. But I don't know if it looks crafty enough. I find that hard to reach. Like, I don't want it to look like Albert's from Recalla. I want it to look like there's paper on paper here. This actually looks a lot better with the dealer. I'm gonna move the death floor up. This is kind of what they look like, isn't it? I did it completely wrong. Why does this feel wrong? Did I do it in the wrong direction? I did. Even that feels wrong. I think they are a lot bigger. That seems more like it. I don't need that. I don't need that. I don't have the presser. That's good. Wait, is the presser like your depression? Or is it like a type of coffee? It sounds like a type of coffee to me. Hello, Agents. So, a thousand and nine. And this is one thousand exactly. I think we need this to be a thousand exactly done as well. Like so. Oh, actually, if you pull it all the way then, it would just fall off backwards, so I don't like that. And then how thick is it? A hundred and 141. Cool. Yeah, Arthur was looking for you earlier. He went in here and said, hi Lila. There is a very similar level in Peach's memory. So I can see why you think that. Just a hello in case, but Twitch didn't let me, because Lila, I think she already said that. It's funny that the sound works. Insane. Thank you for thanking me, Tito.  No problem, bro. There's plenty of me inside the box.  Basically, hell, yeah. That is the best description of it. I think I need nine subdivisions in total. And then this needs to be the opposite. Like so. How many days have you worked on this level? I don't know. I don't keep track of that. I just make games. I don't have space in my brain to think about those things. Bye. Well, we should probably even these all out to accept 821. I don't want to run into an issue with the model editor once Ronsap, the elephant runs on or something. A tentacle being animated from out of the box and taken like a giant tentacle? I think you misunderstand what you're making here. Don't worry. Just keep watching. You will be very excited once you see how this comes together. Have you ever tried importing a new item onto vanilla 6.0 to see the difference? I haven't, but that would be pretty hype to do. I do think I should do something like that at some point. Just for like a video. So, I want this to be like glow in red hell. I think that's a cool effect. Well, I got more code today. QP? Yeah, it is a box opening tab. Okay, we're going to have a bit of a difficulty here because we need this to look exactly the same. Actually, do we want it to look exactly the same? If it looks exactly the same, then I'm not going to be an issue of how you're going to figure out to even pull this. I also think I want a one coordinate gap here, just so you can kind of see inside it. 75 days, there's no way you beat Schizo Scrabble 75 days in a row. Just to give you guys an idea. The Schizo Scrabble for today that I saw was just two words. Falling up? And the answer is four letters. What do you think the answer is? Falling up? What is the Schizo Scrabble answer? Oh, tripping up? Tripping, falling, basically the same thing. So in literally four seconds. Oh, it can be anything. Tripping could be like. You could be like down, because like if you're tripping, you're being down and up. The opposite is down and like a question mark up. So maybe they mean the opposite of up. So they go down could be a good answer, but it's not. Then I thought maybe the answer is fall. Because surely fall has a double meaning with autumn and the season. And then you can somehow connect to up and it's also like the same as tripping. Well, the answer was high, because like when you're tripping, you're high and like up also kind of means high. Saying, OK, well, actually, actually, that's not too bad that you can kind of make sense of that one. You're 85 on the bar? Do you have like the world record in this game? There's no way there's no way. I refuse to believe that's just impossible. Nobody can beat this kid, so it's crazy. Do they have to be other answers that are just as valid as high? I refuse to believe. Will there be a hard mode? Well, I mean, you can just decide to play the game without collecting coins. That's the beauty of Mario 64. You may get a hard mode. If you want a hard mode, just play risky. That looks terrible. When you suck on my 64. Yeah, so you're going to die when you play in hard mode, which is playing risky. Yeah. What did you expect? Well, you can only enjoy a hard mode if there's the extrinsic motivation of the game pushing you to do so. Do you not have a soul? I think this is my nightly routine. Squirtle with reverse. I don't get this one minute cryptic connections. Give four groups of four. Okay. Statistic quiz. Oh, I guess that's weird. Oh, this is weird. Okay. You're playing well twice. Color rush. Oh, okay. Color. It didn't. I color rush is about how good I was, too. Right. Didn't I get a number on this when I played this on stream once? Oh, no, that's just kind of rushing in. Mini suit them. That looks like a wordle. And this also looks like wordle. And this also looks like wordle. Mario wordle. Wordle. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. How many are there? And a waffle. You're playing like six wordles. This is like the opposite of brain rot. How did it go from you asking me if there's a hard mode to you think I have no soul? I think I made my thought pattern quite clear. I think I explained it well. Okay. I think this will work if we use something like this. We could multitask to this with itself. See how that works out. Three wordle clones. I see how this goes. Yeah. Makes sense. I have a feeling if I made like a wordle clone and published it to the app store, Biobank would play it. He would find it somehow. Maybe if I use the structure with less saturation, it will work. 19 sets of wordles. Yeah. Yeah. I can kind of see the similarity here. Don't know if I'm on board with putting those on equal footing here. Because one is something healthy. The other one is just insanity. Wordle has a word that exists. There is a wordle in Mario 64. I think DeathWizard made this. Yeah, add this to your routine. Install an emulator. Play Mario 64. Wordle. Best way to transfer this UV map over. Should be offset by exactly one. That is intentional. Oh, this fits perfectly, though. That's great. This is awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.  Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. So we don't want to do a 100% exact match. But we do need it to be close enough. That seems good to me. Don't forget N64. What do you mean, don't forget N64? Make the color slightly off, maybe. There's this gap here on purpose, so you can see inside. So hopefully that will be enough to see the issue. We can look at this on N64 as well. And then we'll know for sure. Once I have an evil glow, I'm going to make the sides true. That would be what I would like. All vertices must be part of a group. They are. Are they not? Oh, wait. Okay, there we go. That yellow paint, I don't understand the reference. Is this a joke? Please explain, Leela. Would you like to tell the class why you said that? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm still going to make the crayon so that it changes colors. I am thinking of making a video. One bug with every Mario 64 enemy. That could be interesting for the YouTube people. Perfect tool for a video. PDF to brain rot. I've seen those on Instagram. Oh, no. I should do that as a short. That's what it would be about. Yeah, that's called why I am re-raising Mario 64 or something like that. I'm not sure on the title yet. If I did everything right, we should see the zipper now. And the zipper should be in the continuous state of unzipping and then teleporting back. Grass essay ran through that. Oh, I should cut parts of the grass essay like that. Dude, is there an AI tool that can take a YouTube video and pick like the highlights and make shots out of it? There has to be. What do you mean you wrote a coin engine for those coins? One is called pale pile. The problem is with shots, you're never going to make the money back. No one really watches those shorts. The shots that I've made so far, investment wise, has not been a wise decision. I have not made my money back. And now I have a million shots that look like mobile ads on my channel. And I still have like 40 I need to upload. And they're all like that. Oh, something's going wrong here. I mean, it's a title that would do well. Yes, but calling it the secret reason is just too cringe. I can't do it. The real reason. Honestly, yeah. The real reason what makes sense. That's very fitting with the video. Instinctively avoid shots. Yeah, well, the shots I uploaded on my channel, I said them to not be pushed to my subscribers. I just wanted to see how the YouTube short landscapes work out. So it was an interesting experiment to see. Why are these triangles doing that? They just shouldn't. That's just not what they're programmed to do. Smart fit in there even. Oh, definitely. But I don't like how it curls. It doesn't make any sense. Why would it curl like that? There's no reason for it to do that. I didn't program it to do that. That has to be some kind of bug. So, here is the first room. Oh, no 525 triangles. Surely, you're missing a digit somewhere in there. And I hope it's not a nine at the front. 525 triangles is nothing. It's gonna run that on like 120 FPS if it could. Thanks for watching! Decades later, yeah Brodian made that years ago or months ago and it was not even Pilsenzo. How do you get to Pilsenzo making that? There must be some huge confusion here. Yeah, that's how it works.  I'm scanning some info for D-Landhack. It's from Woolly World. How is the development going? Still working on a bunch of little actors in there. It's going very slowly. This is going to be a bit buggy at first, but don't worry about it. I'm just going to teleport there right away. How do you get to Pilsenzo? Star 2 was a fucking insane decision looking back then. Imagine Nintendo announced Odyssey 2 for the Alarmo. Wait, I'm thinking... Do you mean like announcing Star 2 for the 3DS? Or do you mean like the original Sound Stepsies? Yeah, Star 2 was planned at some point by Skalox. It was going to be another Mario 64 hack. And then he just didn't make it. But kept saying he was working on it. He actually still says he's working on it. It's been like 11 years. Yeah, Star 2 started as a Mario 64 hack in like 2013. Then it was converted to a 3D Landhack in like 2016. Then it was converted to like being part of Mario 64 DS's Star Road port in like 2017. Then it was set to be released in 2017. And then it was set to be released in 2020, I think. And then it was set to be released in 2021. And now it's almost 2025. I don't know if the Alarmo can run Mario 64. That's a little too crazy in my opinion. I don't think he has a Luciano at all. I don't think the release has been or was planned ever. Because I don't think he has any progress done. Because that would mean you have to work on it. He worked in his unpleasant. I remember that. I talked to the guys that make Add in Time about it too. Like when I started working there. It was a very funny conversation. I should not be using Fallout here. I should be using something else. You're still fucking old. That's true. Hit the crap pit. You're old too. I think that's a good warning. I don't think it's taking long because he switches games. I think it's taking long because he doesn't work on the game. Interesting. Oh, I need to move Mario as well. See, most people don't actually notice, but most mods never get finished. It's very rare that a mod gets finished, you guys are just spoiled because you are watching me. It's because I've been to Madagascar four years ago. I think it was even longer than that. Honestly, I don't know if it's real. I don't know if I believe it either. I don't know. Okay, well, some issues with this, but that mostly works. There's something really bizarre going on though with the crawling. That's like a crazy bug. Why is it crawling like that? I'm glad you liked it. My editor felt bad that the BLJ video is not doing well, but honestly, I was kind of expecting that it wasn't going to be doing well. So this is depressing. You didn't see the BLJ video? I made a video explaining how BLJs work. Just like the standard YouTuber video where you explain things. And you voted one star without seeing the video? You're really old. Your memory is already gone. So how do I block letting go of Bowser here? Action arc set to two. But that is what I'm doing. Hmm. I'm not understanding this. It's already pretty well known, so I'm not surprised. Yeah, but I think this is the type of video that does well over the years. And not immediately. Yeah, Pan and Coke's videos are always painful in depth. I also sometimes feel like Pan and Coke's videos are a little slow. Like they don't go as fast over everything. Which is something I don't really like. And they're very comprehensive, yeah. Need more surface area here. Hmm. Can Felix clip memebait like some Super Mario Bros. post? I don't think so. I mean, maybe you feel that way, but I know Pan and Coke personally. And I am very sure that none of his videos are purposefully clip or memebaited. I'm sure he actually just wants to use his words to best describe what is going on inside of Mario 64. The way Pan and Coke considers his videos, how I perceive this, is that I think he is thinking about people watching this video 3,000 years down the line. Like, he wants this video to never lose relevance. To not be dated at all and to have every information possible. Something about the code, I think it's a Blender issue. Yeah, yeah, the letting go is definitely not a Blender issue, but there was something else I wanted to fix in Blender. Yeah. It's just the eye. I'm just trying to help me to make it less pixelated. Well, we tried that by making them RGBA 32 textures, which have alpha channels. So we have some aliasing in there. But evidently you don't think that's good enough. So I'm not sure what else we can do, unfortunately. Okay, wait, let me check if maybe the other did the flower also as this bug. Before I try to copy this from the flower over. I should check that the bug doesn't exist here too. Yeah, it doesn't. The fuck? Surely this doesn't pop up anywhere. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. I don't see a bug still. Since you didn't change anything to posting all the times you make half a person, he said the end of his road. Didn't benefit like people are making fun of us and rolling around. Yeah, that's I think that's true. Yeah. How can you let go there, but not here? We should just look at the section. Maybe that has a good sense. Back to holding Bowser. Depressed and no action arc. Well, we're clearly passing the action arc, too. So how is that possible? Do you want to fight? The hell? Can we not? We do go to act, picking up also. Hmm. Surely this will print to at all times, right? Or six even. Well, if that way, it doesn't really a thing I can do about it. The textures right now. Is one pixel of texture is one pixel on screen. So it is physically not possible to render higher detail than that on the N64. Unless I. Increase the frame size, which performance wise would be disastrous. So really, there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. Go. It goes to zero. How does that make any sense? I am so confused by this. Oh.  I see no possible reality in which this makes any sense at all. Do I have to pull out Nemu?  Do we set the action arc here somehow? No. Something is overwriting the action arc only in this level without telling me. And only when you're holding Bowser. Doesn't make any sense. We're using Nemu.  Which one set Mario? 948. Oh, yeah, we have Zeno's friends over today, so. I have to be there. By five this time he just let go before i even got there oh how's this different between emulators this is so cursed it's different between emulators hello graphic tiftler so use the right break point i guess that seems fine to me the w seems fine to me another w where's the star instruction i guess the one above another load another load a load a load a load load box jank debugging there has to be some kind of corruption going on again stalwart v0 that's the star dance where are we um 848 c 848 reset intro scene why is recent interest scene running this shouldn't be running if there's no interest scene so why why did i want to reset this so and why is this only an issue on project 64 either way i don't think we need to reset the intro cutscene when there is no intricate scene that makes no sense but that shouldn't have set the argument anyway  what that's what was causing the crash and i can't rotate the camera okay so we do need to reset the interest scene yes so this is messy i see so this is going over multiple frames when it shouldn't be working like this at all it should just not even call the intro scene if there is none so this bug is a bug that would fix itself in the end it's actually you know what this is not even a bug when it does disable the reset intro scene i'll just find it again the issue is just that there's some unconditional thing we do on the first frame of the level starting when that's realistically not even possible so let's program grabbing this thing this would fix itself as soon as we have like the proper hitbox in for the thing so yahoo oh what happened here that's not the right collision the bug still is there i i have no idea then but the collision is also totally wrong oh we have to stick your wall collision in that's why so oh it's two hours late okay by the way it worked on project it worked on nemu but not on project 64 is that right that would be super cursed so  the tactical burial this might be important so so up well at least the condition is right now and the effect would look really good if it worked and it would really look like you're falling down into hell oh this is gonna look so good once it works all right let me make sure let me let me verify that it doesn't work in that view either oh it does crash after a bit or not crash but for all there's an interesting gap in the geometry here okay i have no explanation so does any of this no it doesn't make any sense wait from code it's i do not like coffee now i don't eat pie do two uh okay we still need the emulator to the debugger to figure out what's going on here maybe breakpoint on action arc is easier maybe we'll listen to him more you know how mario galaxy at the end has these comets that you can collect stars in we've done yoshi's island has that but with yoshi stars instead so instead of a comet appearing there's going to be a yoshi that gives you a mission where it's like do this with these special conditions and you get a star so for example in the demo that was when yoshi was like get the red coins with two or less a presses how did i mess this up huh oh god damn it yeah i'm planning um 45 of those in total so they're kind of just like tacked on as bonus stars that yoshi will not be in the demo i'm releasing this time now take off okay um i want to see if anything writes to the action arc i don't think i can trust these well maybe it really is at one c it is at one c okay let's see it's being read somewhere already but i don't think that's how it should work so oh never mind makes sense so still six now it's starting something new here s2 s2 is 2 that's what it should be so it's all fine so far zero oh where's this act holding bowser it just overwrites it with zero you kidding me so what was this for i now see why oh does this have something to do with that's so weird how that's done so so oh i see this should work by action state not action arc that's weird i was programmed they really just use action arc and action state interchangeably vanilla bro likes his tea skull emoji bye bye okay that's almost good almost we're so close um how do these variables work again i think that means i have to put this at zero x zero this should be fine but pulled it in and mario fell i mean that would be cool too but i don't wanna do yeah oh okay so the animation of the paper is still a little iffy the ending works mostly fine but the beginning not so much nice that's um that means the web works all right uh i just gotta the ost is worldy world i just gotta adjust the animation speed a little bit and then this is perfect but for today i've had enough and i will see you guys in the next stream which i do have the whole week off so i'm probably streaming basically every day maybe we'll do longer streams but i will have to do my workout on stream so until then bye bye
