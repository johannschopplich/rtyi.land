There we go oh my god guys i'm late to stream but it's because i solved like 18 captures before the stream they asked me so many captures before they let me sign in god damn it um hello rio cova to read this chat message please select all pictures of street walks dude i hate captures so much fun fact a lot of captures are actually not trying to test you they are making you do a test so if you ever get two captures in the row on the second capture just type in random bullshit make their business model not work and make someone else stay miserable because they are going to get your capture solution and it's not gonna match you see a capture of like fire hydrants just select everything but the hydrants they're gonna get everyone's life miserable on purpose you know why kiss again boo hello lila hello games i am james okay hello james hello let me show you what i've been working on this week meowdy partner hello g star the first hello nick williams so i have some pretty sick shit to show you guys let's go how do you like this how do you like it yes i'm streaming on twitch and youtube at the same time howdy partner i reckon i'd give you a friendly tip them dry bones up in them hills they're tough as all leather spend their days guzzling milk so wrecking your little hops ain't gonna make a dent figured i'd tip my hat and give you a heads up partner and we get the windows look at this empty they are still gonna get some milk drinks and like stuff on their plates right and the shop's gonna be stored full of milk it's dark well i mean yeah kind of it's not that dark a bit repetitive what the fuck you guys hating this i like this a lot uv variation on man-made floor tiles oh the air dust yeah yeah that could do some one of them should be drinking pilk no hey skedaddle epic missing that loud crowded feel you see in the movies though it's kind of difficult to make this loud and crowded and we also have the issue that all of them need to have a text and it's very difficult to come up with good text for like a million npcs but no having more npcs than this is just gonna like the air dust yeah um it doesn't really render correctly on n64 unfortunately so i might have to do something about that i also really like the lamps here you can see how they mario how they light mario up and they look so shiny the corners of the room just look a bit too dark they need to look dark that's part of the vibe i mean it's really good to come up with all the texts for you uh no i doubt it i have a pond i have just more to life than cowboy had some milk and calling full spartan nah who am i kidding it don't get no better than this but piano work in the corner yeah there still needs to be like a stage here with some stuff in it yeah i don't think we can have more npcs anyway hello ojg i just realized you're here haven't do the thing from the movies where floorboard creaks and everybody looks at you that would be funny but no i don't want them to turn around because they're sitting on the edge of their seats and it's gonna look weird animation wise but can you have more npcs okay one it might cause lag but two more importantly it's gonna suck who wants to talk to this many npcs and then also like how do we give all of them semi-relevant text i don't want to add npcs that then are just gonna not contribute to the game fun also mario's looking too much at these enemies i think i should turn it down yeah but they don't talk to you lila that's the that's the difference anyway we need some ost i like pirate town a lot for this right now i'm waiting for a biomech to uh send me the thing by the way we're gonna be working on chris5 today most likely the koopa with a 10 gallon head yep that's pretty good thank you yeah i'm not that worried about the like leader it's just that texts are gonna suck there will be instructions all right whatever you're making this is the one west level but we're likely gonna switch to the ghost ship level in a bit how much use change do we need to help with coding barely ever i just use it as a google like if i need to know a function name for like unreal engine 5 i put it in there for my mario project i never use it at all there's no use case for it so far unfortunately so can we just turn this like 0.5 and reduce this um if you said this when i did it against evolutionary theory interesting i mean chpd is emulating what people would do so people would probably refuse that because it's such a fundamental belief right no one is gonna budge on like the fundamentals on the worldview when you debate them on it or at least it's very unlikely the enemies are popping in yeah if you do this they have that little pop-in animation what do you mean they're popping in at the edges of the screen because no i don't see that do you just mean that they're not visible rendering like from frame one if so yeah that's like a thing in the engine i need to fix i think oh yeah the wanted posters would be very nice ah yeah yeah the bouncy animation yeah i need to remove that did you forget to add a clear color you mean like here no this game on purpose doesn't have a clear color because applying the clear color takes around three milliseconds which is like 10 percent of the render time of a frame so doing a clear color is gonna be very very expensive for you at 64 how am i going to be no you're not going to be playing this yoshi it's mario returning to island i just came only part of this here after that i don't know i don't know if i will you're bound to be on outside of every source online and getting a story from the other one actually very similar idea i had maybe a bit better this jail cell here every time you catch an outlaw the outlaw will be in here so this jail cell slowly fills up as you collect stars which i think is even better we also got a cactus now isn't that cute someone on twitter sent this to me could you make it smaller who is it hello mario sunshine glad you like the bar this is still an old cactus don't look at it although i almost like the geometry of this better you don't like the lighting here what the fuck oh the lighting in the bar no i want the bar to be dark oh i didn't explain this but wait i need more i need more music um piano cowboy music okay so i didn't explain this before but if you talk to all these guys you'll think there's some you'll find out there's some stuff going on here so let's like talk to him and there's something with a bit more kick yep we got that hey hush now we got ears on us or this guy yep the hidden passage right now hold it hush up now we got an audience and if you look around the level you'll see this one random door handle here it's a fake wall pirate music and it's been true true true pirate and nintendo pirate ost nintendo pirate music there we go um we're just waiting for that for a little bit what in tarnation i have to decom loop for a while how's the lighting effect from the windows done it's just a light like literally just a light in f3d yeah um our mission for today is gonna be reworking the pirate ship but it's gonna take a little bit there's a lot of stuff that i still need to do on the pirate ship actually huge theme in the skybox we want geo no lie actually i don't know if we want them anymore now that biomegas reworked it i definitely need to make some changes to the panorama um zayn i tried to zayn i just scrubbed last week the hell how are you doing this um let me actually change to start warp so cool what did you think of the tier list i uploaded today i ranked all my romhacks so my opinions on windows 11 i don't need even more spyware i would still be using windows 7 if it was a viable option oh yeah i feel like this area could definitely make more use of some cool lighting effects why would you put this tier list in the tier list i don't understand source of the new optimized engine available um i make it available to like some of the other hackers but i haven't publicly released it yet because it has all my romhack in it and i don't want my romhack to release early so there is no racist tag come on man i feel like the water could have been done a lot better here god i didn't realize it was like that we're definitely gonna improve that yeah yeah when i release this hack my engine will be public i'll make the hack open source like all of it at the same time as soon as seven sims open my pc is a bunch of toaster okay i wonder if the doors actually work in this now because remember last time i sent this to Biobak we had huge issues with the doors oh it works i fixed it Biobak right after sending the rom to you i fixed it somehow whoops yeah you can tell this level was made a long time ago i see a lot of improvable parts about the whole aesthetic here like the wood having lines here that's fucking weird this one random light on there actually that's kind of fine the budget windows here they look very out of style this floor here doesn't fit in uh the colors i feel like there needs to be more it needs to be darker in the corners and brighter in the middle have like a bit more contrast in here okay these staircases that that's not actually the staircases may be fine yeah don't worry i'll give the blender model a good review like always the skybox looks a little cramped compared to yeah and the water doesn't fade out correctly it definitely needs the proper fade into the skybox skybox doesn't have the thing dude the metal texture here looks weird doesn't fit with the wooden like there's wood and metal here damn that's not how it should be although i do like these a lot that's very cute where's the noodles on where do you see noodles wait these shadows have no coin these coins have no shadow interesting they do not then we fixed it keep this room in mind because it looks like garbage compared to the rework no offense to 2090 case no i believe you i mean i just saw a bunch of stuff i don't like either do you have a way of making writers colors or is it pain about here uh a little bit of both the ship with clouds and random ship that's a different level entirely sent the model all rights hello are we back Biobak clearly sent me a virus so here we go what i want to make a new folder what's a behavior script um basically mario 64 has like script files like this that run like a complex operations like this spawns a whole object and then they also have like specialized comments like this that run like a certain function um the change lock the change lock Biobak i don't have a change lock there has not been a change lock with what you've sent me it's in the blender file what what is this technology oh there's some text just missing here maybe they're not missing maybe that's just a plan preview being wrong hey he's very active person on ps2 homebrewing called daniel sanders explained maybe he's my company's tmc defense coming just on one competition in the long term well that would be the very obvious suggestion yeah could be i don't know if they're a decision wouldn't they want people to keep modding so they don't become game devs or maybe game def modding is considered like a game Their pipeline and they don't want that. I don't know. Just don't look at it trippy. How do I close this? Biobak is gonna be so sad. Oh god. Okay, fine. I guess we can read this here. Scroll click to scroll sideways. All right, it doesn't work. No, let me close this. How do I do this? Do I have to do... The heck? Surely there's a way to... No! Oh! There we go. Oh, that's a nice looking ship. Yo! Look, it looks like it's drooling. All right. Still allow a tab to view the model better. I prefer the layout tab, yes. All right. All the actors and shit are visible in the modeling tab but discover the model in this tab. Go through the entire model changelog and blender first. There are a lot of changes in room and shit so importing it straight away will not work. Well, I never imported right away anyway. Shipping updated textures and lightning and vibe. Okay, first of all, dude, this is fucking sick looking. Look at this. Oh my god. A thousand seven hundred triangles only. That's good. Okay, somehow we managed to do this with a thousand seven hundred triangles. This looks sick. I like it. The scratches here still look good. Okay, so I asked you something in the DMs. Well, I'm streaming right now. I'm not reading that. Can you ask it on stream? Yeah, this also looks much better. Well, the teeth are already there in my version so this is not something I would explicitly notice. This kind of looks like it's drooling. That also looks cool. Oh, I like this. Oh, but these need to be moved to layer six or this is going to be a rendering issue. Oh, also the texture here. The texture format isn't going to work. Oh, that's an issue. I need to change the texture format here. Let me do that real quick. Yeah, don't worry. I'm going to read the changelog while I do this. I just got to fix a few things. The textures you used are not going to work together. Okay, so you have an alpha map and kind of a color texture. We'll need to, we'll need... This is a multi-texture. Yeah, good question. Your alpha is only zero or one, right? So this doesn't need to be a multi-texture. You can just make this a ci4 and it will work fine. It's also so cut out. This one's a bit weird. It's texture for the alpha and alpha map texture for the lights. Oh, I see. I see what you mean. I see the vision. Yeah. Unfortunately, this isn't gonna work. So this one being intensity 4-bit is good, but this one will have to be like an RGBA 16 and you will have to halve the resolution. Just make the alpha map a ci. It's also not gonna work. If you have a ci, all your textures need to be the same texture. So yeah, I get what Biomech is saying. No, this one will just have to be a lower res texture. I can just do that real quick. So window outside. Shift Alt S. Shift Alt S. Doesn't it just save the Blender file? Wait, what does that do? So how do I best do this? Even a 32 by 64 is too big here actually. Oh, this does have to be a 16 by... This is gonna make your window look a lot uglier. I don't know if you're gonna be happy with this. Oh wait, I removed the alpha mask this way. I see that didn't work. I need GIMP for this. Hmm. Hello, Hoshi. If you do a detector view, it saves the texture. Oh, but I want all the textures anyway. Lila, okay, you need to understand the alpha texture isn't actually an alpha texture. It's like just a texture that is called alpha. So that still looks fine. Yeah, I'm not gonna hate on this one. Wait, how did that just turn so ugly? It was fine before. How did this one turn so bad all of a sudden? I am so confused. Oh, I see. There we go. Hey, we saved it. Oh. He's right where I said for the texture update thing. No, Lila, what you're saying makes no sense. You don't even understand what this is. Um, next. Move the entire ship and all actors up to make the base of the ship taller. Looks better. I hope it doesn't break anything. It is going to break something, but it's fine. Okay, I see. So all of that stuff is kind of moved down. Um, updated geo all around the ship collision mostly the same. Made door to the outside was fine at the back of the ship into a bigger thing with windows. Yeah, that looks very good. Although you can kind of just move on to here now. During the attack, which is a bit weird. Oh, this is also. I don't know if I like this. Are you like married to this UV map by a bike? Because this is like an optical illusion. Almost. It looks like a hill here. Like, are you fine with me doing this? I think that looks better. Oh, I see what you mean. But yeah, I think this is better. Not sure about window brightness. Play it with prim color. I guess you mean these. Now, I think you picked a really good value here. Could have coins for the boss fight since there aren't any at the moment. The boss fight is already pretty easy. I don't think we need any, but maybe. No, this ship is just here. Actually, this is our course five. We made this like three years ago. Add an icebreaker thing to the front under the mouth. Oh, I see. That's what that is. It looks like he has a little goatee. It's a drooling shark with a goatee. I thought it was pretty damn hard. Really? Okay, maybe I'll add coins. Let me do my to-do here. To-do. Consider adding coins to boss fight. Let me save this. Change lock. Okay. Made it three years ago and it's still your best looking level. This is the rework. Next. Added window cannon holes around the ship. Oh, the cannon holes look good. What layer is this on? Layer four. Okay, that should be fine. Is this still layer four? This is layer five now. Oh, that's not gonna be fine. This has to be layer four. Unfortunately. I know it looks worse, but if this is layer five, then we're gonna get a z-sorting issue. Actually, I guess I could z-sort this. I guess I could z-sort the render if you really wanted to. Does it look so different? Oh, but it's gonna be a lot more expensive. I think it has to be layer four. It seems so empty even. No, I don't want there to be other ships. This is a ghost ship. Having other ships ruins the vibe, if you ask me. Made railings real. True, the railings are real. Very, very real railings. Added railing to the boss arena part. Yep, they look cool. Move the small pillars to be centered with the door. Small pillar. I guess this one here? That's what she's talking about. This little area here looks good. Oh, it's just cut out. You think maybe we should move this up slightly like so? And two small ones. Oh, these two, I see. Yeah, okay, that looks better. Six months ago, you saw me working on a ship. This ship is years old, but this is a rework. We have a bunch like prettier looking levels now. Do you like this being pushed up a little bit by OmegaSwar? Like so? So I might mess with the piano. Nah, the piano's fine. Trust. I'm the programmer. And it's super beams to platforms on pillar and masts. I guess super beams is what is the super beam? Oh, these. Oh yeah, that looks sexy. Wait, did you make a whole texture just for this? Is this texture used anywhere else? Hmm. It's 20 triangles. We could turn this into... What is this? 20 triangles. We could turn each one of them into 8 triangles without a texture. Right? Because it's like two on each side. So that's 160 triangles. Per triangle we're gonna have like 0x20 bytes of data. Compare that to the texture here which is I think 0x100. Okay that's only a ci4 64 by 32. Don't know if that's gonna work. Hmm. 5120 bytes. Actually this is gonna be cheaper than... Wait, why did I say 160? Wait, how many is this? 20. Okay yeah I would have to turn this into 160. Okay never mind. This is cheaper than making these triangles. All good. If you have to calculate so much it probably isn't worth it. Yeah it's not worth it. Clamor rolls are not properly attached. Safety violation. Oh I see that looks cool. I like it. Added an extra loop cut to the grind ropes to make them smoother. Yeah that looks good too. Added anchor. Dude the anchor looks nice. This should probably be an i8 though. Or maybe not. Maybe it's better as a ci8. What the hell. There was one loose vertex somewhere. Show me the netting on the beams in the wireframe mode for a second. I want to see how it looks. The netting on the beams. Sure there. Oh you cut this out. Interesting. All right that looks good though. Added the plank. Can't believe you forgot the plank. True the plank very important. Could make Mario jump higher to get coins like a diving board. Added a subdivision so you can make it react to Mario's weight and bounce when it jumps. Interesting. Okay to do. Add a bouncy diving board. Maybe it has a Yoshi coin if you ground pound on it and jump very high question mark. I think that would look very cool to get a Yoshi coin from here. From like ground pounding it pretty high. And it could even be a shortcut up here. I'll make a note for that. Have it also be working as a shortcut up to the rope. I think that would be a very cool strategy to do. Very cool trick to show your friends. Made a hole for the mast in the big net near the boss area. Shredded the sails some more. Looks better as transparent than cut out. Yeah unfortunately transparent. It's gonna have rendering issues. And this area is already pretty expensive to render. Because if you look from here there's like one, two, three, four, five possible overdraws. Sail combiner you made does not export. The combiner I made doesn't export? How? What's wrong with that? Is this a fast 64 bug? It should look fine. I changed it also check the rest of the text but it says the textures are too big. It says the textures are too big. Huh? How could this be? Leela I feel like you might know this. How are these textures too big? The first one isn't normally an i4. Oh it has to be an i4. Can't see the second one. There. Added shadows to the grates in the center of the hull. The grates in the center of the hull. This? Am I missing something here? Why is this solid? Where's the shadow? Is this supposed to be layer four? Oh that looks nice. Shouldn't be so weird that it was. Layout five. Oh, that's even better! I hope this renders right, because the shadow might render in front of this, but I think we can sort the polygons to fix that. You remapped the cannon stance like a fucking work of art. Okay, I like it. Added seaweeds around the ship. Attempted at a better sea-to-sky transition. Expensive? Let's see. Okay, hmm, yes, this is expensive. I will do something similar. The problem with this is that these waves are gonna go up and down, so this transition here is gonna... the waves are gonna go through it, so I'm gonna have to delete this transition for now. What we are going to do is we're gonna use the skybox here. We're gonna transition the skybox at the bottom into a color, and then we're gonna transition like the outer ring of this, right? We're gonna have like these. We're gonna clamp them to the skybox, and we're gonna transition them into the sea color here. Yeah, and the skybox is gonna be in view space. Let me add that as my nodes. Make skybox fade into color at bottom. Make sea fade into same color. Put skybox into view space. Hello, SmithJrBlockWaluigi. It's been quite a while, hasn't it? We are still making Mario over here. Spookified the rocks. These are very spooky rocks, I agree. You know what would be fun? If the rocks kind of look like a shape of something, like a shape of a ghost or something. I don't know. I'm not sure what I'm talking about, but you get the idea. Okay, next we go to the ship interior. Biobak has been hyping this one up for a while. Did he make any changes to this area? I don't think so, but that area was already pretty. I reworked this recently. Oh god, this is so different. Holy shit, everything is different. How did he do it? I couldn't remove pixel ordering. How are you gonna do that? Tell me the algorithm. Updated textures and lighting. Dude, you updated fucking everything. Nothing's the same in here. Hmm, one thing that I feel like might be missing here is the chandelier at the top. It has like these lights, the blue lights on it and I feel like that's not here. Right, the blue lights are gonna be missing. Let me show you what I mean. I'm not sure if there was something you'd already been thinking of. Don't worry, I thought of it. Oh shit. Okay, well I'll keep reading the changelog then. Removed slope ceiling, falling floor room and picket door room were moved down slightly as a result. Okay. Yeah, the ceiling looks very nice actually. They did ceiling design. Moved most of the painting to another room. No more paintings in here. Okay. Oh, there's still that one with the shy guy in it. Fucked up the carpet. This combiner should work I think. Let's see what we got here. Oh, it's transparent but it's on the floor. It needs to be layer six. It's a decal. Also we should never use environment color here. Oh, the combiner does not work because you combine the CI texture with something again. But this can very easily be cut in half. All right, let's fix this texture here. Like we'll have to do something like that. But it's no big deal, right? Oh God, the oven turned on again. Whoops. Yep, that still looks fine and this works now. Sounds like the inside of a monster's stomach. Goddammit. Revamped library section. Okay, it looks very different. Did you kill the red coin here? You now have to push the metal shelf into the wall. The tiny hole in the ground was weird. Pushable shelf has red books and coin pattern. Markers the floor, it hints. Oh, okay. The idea here is super neat. The fuck? Oh, I see. I'm on the wrong level. Bookshelf red too. This is gonna be difficult to figure out for players, I think. That's Nemuel, the Mario icon. Places a normal coin in front of it. Oh, there's also scratch marks here. I think the scratch marks make it good again. Yeah, I think this is fine. We could also just have this be protruding a little bit. I think we should make this like come out a little bit. Like instead of just having the stand here, we're gonna have it like come out like so. That's what I'm thinking. Like, okay, it's blatantly obvious now, but that's fine. This is not good because this is a hard puzzle to figure out. This is good because we are showing a cool idea to the player, and the player is like, oh, that's neat. My brain is expanding. So it doesn't need to be difficult. Difficulty here is unnecessary. Bethesda type mindset. Bethesda puzzles are look at the item in your inventory. Which, how the fuck would you even think to do that? Let's see. Next is, um, edit one box to the boxes on the right side. He added a single one box. Chest platform on the left side is no boxes. Okay, I like it. I like it. This looks like a cargo room now. Good call. Weird hole in the wall is now broken crate. Weird hole in the wall. Oh, that's such a good idea. Also very, very good. Why are you using primitive color alpha here? If you're using primitive color alpha, it's gonna be like one extra instruction. So instead, we just like to do this. Edit windows to match outside. Yep, yep. They look good. Probably attached ropes again. Yeah. Made a book bigger so it doesn't look out of place. Oh, this one here. Yeah, that is about the same size as the rest. Anyone remember what we put here? Like what the text was? I think this says captain's log and then, dude, this text, something was in here, but I don't know what it was. Updated candle and all make the flame the same color as the windows. Looks nice. Wait, so what were you thinking for the chandelier? I didn't see that in there. I think it was a bunch of nonsense. Probably. Yeah, not that this looks good, but like originally there was something like this. God, you need to look up at the chandelier to even see it because of the culling radius. Oh, you updated the flame color. I see. Oh, what the fuck? That's for sure a bug. What the hell? Crumbling floor room. Updated textures and lighting. Okay, I like these textures. Updated ceiling design. Okay, the lines here align again. I see what you did. Updated tile floor. Tiles are now square. Previous bricks didn't make much sense in a boat. Requires more actual tiles, but probably fewer polygons. Okay, I'll have to make a lot of programming changes here because this is going to be a completely new layout, but it shouldn't be an issue. My question is, does the size of the tiles match up? 333 coordinates and this is 2,500. There's no possible way this can match up because 2,500 is something visible. So they're kind of squished. Wait, Badoob just wrote me. Is this good news? Okay, quick detour. Quick detour. He made a salute song. The beginning of it is kind of like the zoo level. It's a lot like the zoo song. It's a nice song, but it doesn't quite have the vibe I'm looking for. And it's too much like the zoo song. Let me see if I can find the zoo one. What's the music? A song Badoob just made. I don't have the zoo song anymore. Let's see if I can find it on here. So yeah, it's the same one. Let me just tell him what I was thinking here. I was thinking it should sound like this. Yeah, too upbeat and happy, I find too. Oh, he says he's changing it. Nice. Yeah, that was for the saloon. Okay, I think this is all the changes to Taro. Okay, he's saying he was too happy too. I guess he made this before he saw the saloon. It's kind of difficult, I guess. Sleeping tables room. Let's see what we have here. Updated geo and lighting. Okay, so this is now the blue room. Oh, that looks cool. I like this. I still got the kraken here. Kept the blue interior because I think it fits this room. Added a big net and they get fall damage. Kind of unfair to die from that fall. That's true. Yes, the player should not take fall damage here. Although it's kind of hard to take fall damage here. The kraken is way too low res. Yeah, it is a little bit out of style. I agree. Well, there isn't much I can do here. Oh, I guess it's also no longer an opaque day color. Don't you have the original one? I think so. Can maybe subdivide it more. Maybe make the big net bouncy like the hammocks. Having to make a whole loop if you miss the red rhyme is not fun. Well, you can just wallkick up here. Let's be honest. This is 800 coins. You can just sideflip up there almost. This will be fine. Hello, agile gamer. Put in the level for visual aid, but you should remove it and replace it with venom. Actually, the intention honestly was that you would fall down here and you would have to do the whole loop because I was thinking that the first time you fall down here you wouldn't have explored this area before, but that's probably fine. This is probably better. This is safer for sure. Widened part with the hammocks will have to either remove one side of the hammocks or scale them a bit. Why? Okay. Well, I can just scale the hammocks. I think it will be fine. Remove door to the Shy Guy flag game. What? Entrance is... Wait. Entrance is now in the pink room below. The big net for consistency will ship the exterior. Let's catch bugs in front of the door. Let's climb back up. May not work with room lead in. Maybe have a Shy Guy barrel throw you out to the room. Okay. So I guess the switch that we had here now just has to open this instead of spawning a block. That's fine too. I'll add it to the to-do list. The switch to enter Shy Guy says game needs to open the door instead. Although this is going to be difficult cutscene wise. Like are you just going to step on that and then the camera is like going to go out of here and show you that? Yeah, it's spawn time blocks so you could climb up and enter the door. Maybe it's a bit silly, but it's kind of like how the other puzzle works. You just hear creaking doors. It should be fine. I think it's going to be a bit confusing. What if we make a hole in here that you can look through? What could a hole here be made out of? Just like a hole in the wood. That's what I'm thinking. Dude, these textures are so much better. Why is there a white prim color on this again? Oh, Biobak loves doing this. I'll just cut the camera to the doors. Just like have the camera be like here so you can see. Yeah, cut camera to the outside where the door opens. Maybe also show the door slowly closing again to make this time challenge. I think that would look very cool. I don't want to escape my past. Rope to climb back may not work with unblowing. May have a shack. Okay, let's see that. Rope to climb back may not work. Okay. No, I can program objects to exist in two rooms at the same time. It's going to be a bit difficult to make this work with the room or not, but it should. The door's closed. How do you get out of there? We'll make it so that if you are in this room, then it's not gonna, then it's just gonna keep open or something. I'll be put a switch here as well, right? It wouldn't hurt to just have a switch here as well to open the door Updated switch mini room slightly tweaked size and position. Yep. That looks a lot nicer now Switch should open the doors and not be timed. Why was it even time before I like a timed Because like you get to run and then you crouch to like run below here, which is a very cool experience I find Doors are double doors that blend cool new custom made windows. Yep. I like them Why are they cutouts They need to be layer one It's a lot cheaper to render layer one than layer four. Well, not a lot but it's a little bit They can also just be fused with the rest of this now Because they're no longer layer four That's pretty well layer one is cheaper. I Am RD Yeah, I know see, okay, this is something Romika still they keep telling you layer four and layer five is so expensive and don't understand Why and it's literally just not even true most of the time And shall the image father explains what I thought seem confusing with one of your polygons, okay An image that is confusing with my polygons You only did Hey, I Am very confused by this to only at the first one amount of poise or the second one What am I looking at this is a troll Get it No, I mean an email is nice and easy for me to read that's not the issue but I don't understand the post Something up here No, this is alright, I don't know what you could possibly have seen Switch and okay. Wait cool new custom made windows. That's what you said updated anchor to match outside Let's see where the anchor is. Oh We have two anchors now Let me check this material He did this again, why is he doing this to me dude, this is not even a sneaky triangle This is a sneaky display this comment. He's inserting. That's like less than a sneaky triangle, but more than nothing It That's true you make sure that your anchor doesn't get eaten Slightly tweaked size and position switch should open the doors and not be wait. Nope attach the beds to the walls and poles The bets Oh this okay. I see what you mean Updated cop web placements Cop web Cop web, I don't know what cop web is but I'm gonna trust you on this one What did you do to this one here because this is a CPU generated text I Guess you didn't change it Yes, can I send please sure you can do that Flame flag game room pillars everywhere. Oh My god, this looks so powerful dude, look at this Sick-ass glowing goo, please animate it like we said I don't know if I completely remember what you wanted, but surely I can do that I Added a star platform Who that looks very shippy Room 5 layer 6 Celtics on the sign is no longer used, but I don't know what to do with it Room 5 layer 6 I Love how all of these objects are just misspelling of Mario start. Awesome 5 layer 6 Okay, well it's not only used we delete it this is gonna make a compile issue, but it's fine I Have to fix a bunch of errors with this anyway I Had a cop webs, okay rotating room and treasure room Dude, this room is so fucking cool. Oh He also updated this that's one thing that I complained about this looked really bad before But this is so cool how the lighting transitions between rooms. I like it there was No shit, like the back of the boat for consuming with the outside. Okay Dude I love this area. This is such a cool idea Treasure room is now shaped like the back of the boat resets the box. I don't know if I did it correctly Resized the box. Oh Okay, I see what you mean the room box This is just an additive blender additive blending is very strong and very underutilized it gets you cool lighting effects Glowing gold new props include real-time ray-traced gems Real-time ray-traced gems. So let's see these real-time ray-traced gems here A size 4 by 8. Okay, if it's a 4 by 8, it needs to be an RGB a 32 Yeah, that's a real-time ray-traced gem if I've ever seen one Can you believe he put ray tracing into my blender file Oh The Mona Lisa is here You could dude you have a fucking silicon The contact just bath maybe I Think the Mona Lisa reference is fine I'm a little bit split on it on whether I like the Mona Lisa reference, but I think it will be fine. Oh Lay out five can't have that. Oh, no None of these set the render mode and the two second material You We're gonna have a lot of render issues in this I think but it's fine we can fix them all I Put the star wherever true. I'll just put the star somewhere try plopping in my contact Do you have a favorite painting no, I don't like paintings I Don't like that like paintings are synonymous with art. I think that's stupid. I don't like paintings at all I'm a painting hater. I Thought Mona Lisa was a turtle fair honestly, I can see why you would think that You can use a higher risk grayscale context and vertical probably yeah, but we don't want that Actually, we might have already done that Updated textures and lighting. Okay edits props. He added props I Guess the rooms no longer look the same. That's good. I think I'm not sure what props he added here Rooms are slightly taller now to make way for ceiling pillars. Okay Much the last room with the new captain quarters. Oh Shit, what where did this come from? Oh my god This whole room came out of nowhere this wasn't here before that looks fucking sick Yeah, the painting is perfect he just says paintings of himself and of his ship That's very in character Put the skybox outside and see what's inside     Good it looks. Oh, I'll definitely add the skybox here. Let me make a note for that Or maybe it's at the skybox I'm thinking lighting from the other. Okay, that's I'm 50-50 on this because if we had the skybox outside, we also need the lighting from the skybox, right? I It's alright with the skybox you think so, hmm Do you think maybe we need to add like a light source to these rooms, is it a bit weird? They're just bright like that And I'll make a note for that And skybox to camp Captain's quarters. Also This room needs a Yoshi coin that needs to be a Yoshi coin in here. This room is too cool to just be useless Okay, let me go back down here Captain's quarters 8 million polygons 2300 triangles, that's fine Literally, no other purpose except be pretty world building true. This is a very liminal space here I'm not ignoring you on purpose All right, I'll look at your updated painting This still makes no sense It's not a show I thought I had six or eight polys and do what I thought it looked like and only use for in my image example What is it What am I looking at I don't get it Just trust that it's fine, I think Don't ignore me Leela. I I Don't smell some regular because they have decoration on them. Yeah The paintings from the red coin room are here now could do an easter egg with the treasure map Mmm, that's a good idea How would you do an Easter egg with this Carter He's the general oh he sneaked in another dispellers comment here This is a prime opportunity for an Easter egg I agree Cut this down. I can't work as an IE 8 How can we make an Easter I got of this Something like the way you enter the ice capital to imply the pirates once we're on the island Yeah, that would work That would work Although it's gonna be hard to visually showcase this I'm gonna note this down under my end of game stuff thing And I'm game stuff The pirate map in tourist 5 should mark a location that Corresponds The ice caps Entrance Doesn't need to be a perfect hint just a neat reference Yeah, we need the overworld first so this is definitely not to do for right now but for later So should load the background from the ship exterior Yeah, that's pretty easily done especially if you make this a background itself very very easy You're just care if you died of an even for equal sizes here what I'm saying is I think you're netting skirt doesn't need to six Or eight lines. Are you talking about the netting? Wait, this is supposed to be about the netting I Thought this was about the thing marked here. Okay. What let me see what you mean about the netting You Mean to tell me to get rid of this but these are actual polygons that deform stuff. I Don't want to get rid of them Sure, we can reduce the try count but it's gonna look worse Um, what layers the carpet on here five it's this carpet only used here Shit this carpet is gonna be annoying to make work This was never a robot ripoff, come on I'm Being bullied Okay, we can never use environment color alpha environment color alpha is a random value at any point in time It can be anything Carpet light, let's see what that looks like Oh It's this one we need to edit this Right, okay I Could have pressed all our I could have saved so much time There we go saved any nth color and offers, okay good I Think I messed up the transition here But I should be able to save it to look somewhat fine at least Is Anyone going to complain about this That's the best we're gonna get You will shit Oh It's barely visible the last job is to complain that is true Okay, I can fix this I cannot fix Lila but I can fix the carpet  Fuck Of an U.S. And dragged to a can you can do something about this to can I fucking see the level there we go wasn't that complicated what the hell how can this be dude that's just weird snapping settings again so it's exactly 28 I see let's do it like this doing that again that is seamless but the size of these don't match up yeah that's the most seamless we're gonna get it i think that looks fine i live in canada wait what the hell why is there a seam again how did this happen that's seamless you can see the seam where it's literally the same uv coordinate look at that literally 48 exactly it's not possible for there to be a seam actually i think i know what you're seeing maybe it is possible for there to be a little bit of a seam it doesn't get any better than that rotate that so the moon is visible through the windows because that looks cool as hell true i'm gonna add that next room prison oh that's that's an interesting lighting until i'm now in the dark better cannons with ray tracing cannons with ray tracing unbelievable yeah that's ray tracing better secret hole okay yeah that looks good we need to make sure that the hole is actually seamless though it's gonna be difficult updated torch designs yeah the torch were really really cheap this kind of looks like minecraft though you know why this looks like minecraft is because he didn't give it the patented case twist do you think this is better maybe if it wasn't in the wall so i think this looks a little less minecraft it won't look minecraft with a flame maybe updated cage design will need collision for the bars yeah this cage is a lot prettier looks good more and better chains okay yeah the chains are better i'll just make sure the combine on this is fine it is fine is this supposed to be a ci4 or this is also working on ia8 ia8 has a lot more precision so i prefer this actually same here ia8 is gonna look cleaner that's ia4 it could be ia8 it's gonna look the same in blender but in game this is gonna look a lot better so is this using the same thing but i think i got dmc for the other one um neither actually i'm using or well actually right now it's using something similar to the portal one but i'm making my completely own version because the one that's in portal 64 is bad the live ultra that nintendo provided is really really bad hello car flash why do the bars have white outlines now they were already there beforehand this just made them visible knocked down a door for the sake of variation oh okay that looks cool lip case went it's kind of what i call it yeah actually no it's the original is called lip ultra i called my lip super because when digimons evolve they i don't know if they have a super level but i think that's the level after mega level in digimon yes but they didn't have them when i was modeling i changed the texture last minute so that's probably why i can look into it and see if i can remove it but we all know this shit never fucking works and go super dan ultra no hey they're black outlines it worked ultra is better than super no okay what comes after ultra ultimate mega lip mega and it's sealing beams oh dude the way the the lighting stops here is so good lip hyper there we go that will be my legacy can this be an ia8 it can be okay dude why is it warning me of that do we not have that surely we do did you make a video larry when the main copy promise to resist you're using mario i doubt it um comedy club this is an easter egg level that most of you guys probably won't even be seeing if you play the game updated textures and lighting okay oh this looks very nice slightly updated geo better whole instant joke about my ex okay biomex x had a bad hole i see how this gave the a little stage to perform his stage is very cool looking i like it okay added very modest amount of vegetation yeah the vegetation is perfect especially since this is underwater it's very fitting another sneaky displayless comment here okay this is layer five this should be fine this is like the banjo kazooie special is it not so planks all around because of the hole makes sense added ceiling beams added rope change the watercolor added rope oh oh yeah very nice and decorated i'm always sus of these now because something always seems to go wrong with these um i think we can actually have backface coming out on this not that it matters but yeah we could call it liberty oh make an out of bounds able to be seen treasure room the players will have to be like oh if only we can have it nah that's weird i don't want people to look out of bounds and that's it those are the level changes in this file so the question is how much of the collision still lines up yeah that's what i thought none now actually a good amount still lines up i think it's gonna be easier to remake collision map from the ground up the sick-ass wrapped rope in the prison the wrapped rope the wrapped rope so what am i looking for on a ceiling beam oh the chain oh oh yeah that's very sick ass so the rooms near the room with the giant table the room with the giant table that there are rooms greetings insane level detail you're getting better and better i can't wait for release well bio back made this so you shouldn't be praising him but yes this looks very very good did i not have back face cutting on this and these that's better so we should ban at the tilly as a punishment for someone saying something stupid everyone is on board with it god damn dude how do we have 170 viewers what did i do why am i suddenly famous i didn't do anything make sure to uh buy my energy drinks okay before i'm doing anything i'm gonna push all my stuff pre-c5 i'm gonna be so busy working on this this week you deserve to view us it's kind of weird to talk about deserve in the context of youtube because you just kind of get what you take right how do you measure what someone deserves um i'm in the saturn dev community and we can chat regularly oh that's cool you think we were gonna be like oh man lila likes this i better avoid it i don't want to become a fucking weirdo like her okay it's all committed it's not gonna export on the first try i can already tell you there's still many active mario 64 i guess most of them just don't really do anything special and export it so  biomech jump scare true actually oh i need to old age oh god this is gonna be okay dude i remember how to do it let's go it's really sad about bottle 64 i wonder what james is gonna do about this highly concerning so okay the errors are room 9 layer 4 room 5 layer 6 okay room 5 layer 6 biomech sadly got rid of it so we can delete it uh what the fuck what kind of cursed setup did i do here honestly this is optimal so you can't hate on that just a little practical to work with okay make sure to turn on mad blade i'm not turning on mad blade for now mad blade is going to be turned on at the very end because it makes it more difficult to work with stuff room 9 layer 4 is this room 9 oh okay i see how it is at one point gonna make videos showing how simple and easy it is to make some things i don't want to explain how it works but how to do it and no it's self-explanatory if you can't figure it out then that's on you they're setting a button for it in fast 64 like you're not gonna get any more help than that i don't think a whole video for that is warranted in fact see if you want to know how to use texture scrolling and you really can't figure it out you can go into the fast 64 discord and say texture scrolling doesn't work and then lena will be like dude it literally works look this is how you do it so room 9 layer 4 so this is room 9 there's a bunch of layer 4 assets in here so So one issue we're gonna have is that a lot of the rooms will have visuals that are sorted wrong. It's called Murphy's Law. True! Murphy, yes, of course. Yeah, once I told my very close friend that I liked her and she said she does too and now we're dating many moons ago when we were in the middle school. I remember she once picked up a dying rat and just tucked it in the woods behind my house. Okay, why did you tell me about the fucking rat? Who cares? Bro. Oh, right, I removed room 2, layer 6. It compiled. There is no way this looks right on the first try. Can't remember if this is a joke or if it's a result of ProSlaught. Yeah, that's a good response to that. Yeah, so this is about what I expected to happen. Okay, so this is about what I expected to happen. Oh, you already moved everything up 500 coordinates. Then why the fuck did it crash? You know what? I get to show you guys the debugging emulator today. Oh, I have a good idea why it crashed. Probably the sails. Yippee! Fortnite on cola. Yippee! How do you know about Coleslaw? It's when you mix vegetables in mayo and sauce. That sounds disgusting. Dude, I'm glad there's a law against that. Haven't seen it already? Probably. I don't like this graphic plugin. This is not a fully cooked emulator yet. I'm just beta testing it for the guy that made this. And I like this emulator a lot. I might have to reopen it. Okay, hot take. This is gonna make me unpopular because of all the programmers here. But I think programmers in a 35 hour work week, they just work 10 hours. I feel like programmers are the laziest people on the planet. Every time I hear a programmer talk about their job, it just sounds like they're doing nothing all day. Cool crash. Matrix underflow. Good for them to be honest. Yeah, I'm not hating. Except when programmers say about how busy they are, because clearly they are not. Are you a programmer for your job? Yeah. I'm not being lazy though. But there's legit, this is a thing going on. Programmers are being over-employed. Meaning they take on free jobs and they work like 10 hours on each one of the free jobs. And they get free salaries. And no one notices. Programmers get away with like so much shit. As a 3D model, I think video games worked the hardest, so we paid more than lesser people. It's true, by the way. It's not everyone, but it's a lot of them. There's articles about this too, about programmers that just feel like they do nothing on their job. That just scroll Reddit all day. So next customary worked? That's up to Biobuck to decide. Okay, why would there be a matrix underflow here? Very interesting bug. This is definitely pirate music. Yarr harr. Oh, the factory. Yeah, you could do that one if you want. Dude, why are you posting this ChanchoPT message four times? I get it. I'm not gonna respond to everything everyone says, because sometimes I just don't have an interesting response. And then I will just ignore your message. It makes the stream more pleasant for everyone. Wait, fuck. I just messed up the net. Go swap the poop deck. Why is that a joke? That was a joke in Battle for Bikini Bottom. How is that funny? What's funny about swapping the poop deck? Yeah, if I'm ever ignoring a chat message from you or just miss it, it's personal. Like I've singled you out. It means I hate just you. Out of everyone in this chat, you're my least favorite Chancho if I ever ignore a message from you. Just for your information. You should take it personally. You should honestly take a clip from the stream of me ignoring it and compile it. And then post it on Twitter and say I'm a bad person. Don't even tag me on it. Just say I'm a bad person. That's a shame. Yeah, real shame about that. What's funny about the word poop? No, no, what's funny about swapping the poop deck? Biobak has been counting every time I ignore a message. That's another stat. That's another tally. Yeah, it's true, Goony Balloony. Actually, I don't know how much 3D artists are paid. But I can definitely confidently say that programmers are overpaid. We are out of pirate music. Damn. I mean, that's why so many people want to be programmers, right? Soon, programmers are going to be unemployable. And then we're going to have a different issue entirely. My face with poop on it. Damn. Okay, we should start trying things to prevent this crash. Let's remove a bunch of objects and see if it still crashes. You got a new OST for me? That's the exact one I had opened just now. So yeah, you just sent me the same one we just listened to. Can I send a winter highlander? Okay. Okay, something about the combiner doesn't work. Interesting. It's definitely very slow.   It's very spooky looking, but I like it. Oh, you removed the lightning effect. Probably on accident. Okay, yeah, this is going to be really hard for you to model around, actually. Yeah, the thing is, to have a thing affected by lightning, you need to subtract nth color. So this was basically impossible for you to do, honestly. Oh, this looks bad too. Why is that? See, the way I add the lighting is like this. And then I just set the environment color to zero here. So it literally just subtracts the environment color for the lightning. The demo didn't have this. And yes, the waves are part of the level. I just removed a lot of features from the level, because it had issues. Yeah, it's easy to put it back though, so it's no big deal. Now, why is this not working? Oh, you made a two cycle texture. This needs to be two cycle to work correctly. Okay. Okay, easy fix. I'm also going to subtract nth color here. Oh, that was already subtracted. Okay.  Okay, let's load into this level again and remove different objects to see which one could be crashing. How levels will be re-reworked eventually, that's not unlikely. I don't like Banjo Kazooie. Not a fan. Okay. No, which one on the, wait, there are Yoshi coins in this. I already added Yoshi coins to this. The fuck? Why do I not remember that? Either way, these probably suck. Do they not suck? Okay. Behind the middle tail pole and one of the cages, middle of the falling stairs. Wonderful. Hell yeah, these all suck. Can easily add some. It looks good, but I liked it better when it was worse. Dude, I genuinely got comments before that were like, dude, I think actually Kazooie's best tech is Mario 64 Madness. The one shitty garbage tech. Just because it had soul. After that, Kaze lost his soul, honestly. I think the most likely one to cause these issues here is the lightning and the texture items. So, let's remove these and see if it still crashes. Hmm. Maybe it's a Shy Guy Captain? We're gonna remove one object type at a time. We're always gonna remove the one that seems most likely to be causing the issues here. Well, that's still not it. What else could it be? I don't think it would be the moving crates, but I'm gonna remove these next. Because they do some weird camera math. Sonic Adventure is fine by default. Like, yeah, there's a bunch of bugs, but it's playable. It's not like Sonic Heroes, but... Sonic Heroes is generally just unplayable. We tried to beat the game and then one level that's like 12 minutes long, we died to three different bugs in the level during the A rank stuff. And it's just... no. Like, it actually gets in the way of the bugs. Sonic Adventure? No issue. Sure, there's stupid parts, but no game-breaking bugs like that. Hello, Marcelo. That's good. Still crashing? How? It couldn't possibly be the boo guys. At least I don't think so. We're getting desperate. Maybe I should have tried the binary search strategy instead. They designed another Dreamcast with almost no deadzone? No controller comes with a build in deadzone. The N64 stick doesn't have one either. You can just program the deadzone into the game. Alright, let's do the ship cannon next, I guess. And then after that, the ghost platform, maybe? But how do any of these cause a crash from just changing the level geometry? That's the crazy part here. Dude, this feels so weird. It's like there's less input lag than usual on this emulator. No, don't make them boop, guys. We only have two ghost platforms? Weren't there so many at the beginning? I feel like I had like six. How? Could it be a fucking coin formation? What if it's like a coin formation going over the rim? And because there's no floor, it just crashes? That doesn't even make any sense, no. Desperation, yeah. But no, we will find that culprit eventually. Dude, the Xbox controller has a left drop by default. It feels so weird to use. And what's the coin? Oh that looks cool, that looks cool as fuck. It looks so grimy and dirty now when it's dark. But I kinda like it. These do not look good, not at all. Something seriously went wrong with these. I don't think they look that ugly in the level. I guess we have to figure out what's wrong with the coins. No, they do look this ugly in the level. Pilebag didn't mean to do this, right? There's no way. This texture feels like a miss. Is it just me thinking this is ugly? I think the issue I have with this is that it has so much less detail than the rest. I have an idea. I think there's a pretty easy fix here. It just needs a bit more detail, honestly. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe it's too dark now. I still don't really like it. I don't think it's Gen Alpha Slang. I think it's just people ages 15 to 25 pretending it's Gen Alpha Slang and then making fun of it, pretending that's what they actually do. You guys turned into the Boomers. A bit too dark. Hmm. It's a bit too bright. Meh. That's about the best I can do, I think, without changing the vertex colors and everything. That should work. It also makes the darker parts less dark, which I kind of like. Although at that point, we might want to turn this into a proper IE4 texture instead. I think it would look better that way. Hmm. Heh. The selected area is empty? How? Heh? What did I do? Ctrl-J. Select the black parts. Okay, now it works. Let's try that. Okay. Okay. Now... I think that's the best we can do with this. It's too bright. I don't think it's too bright. And if you want to turn the brightness down, we could just turn this down a little bit. But keep in mind, the end color is still going to be subtracted from this. We get more HD, the outlines look whack. Can't. If anything, we might need a different texture altogether. We still need to figure out why the coins are crashing. That's a little bit mysterious, don't you think? Don't I think? Was that it? Just that one? Okay. We also need the death floor here. Actually, this doesn't need to be a death floor, now that I think about it. Because you can't actually go here anyway. I'm pretty sure this is a different one. But actually, let me just set this to death, just in case. Can you mark this out on a decommit margin for GameCube? I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. Star contrast compared to the ship. I don't think contrast is bad. It would look weird if the light was not part of the world. I would see that. That's usually what it is when something just looks off, that the lighting is just wrong. Head on NeoVim. I need to switch my emulator. Dude, it feels so much better to be on a GameCube controller. What the hell? Yeah, it was that coin. Oh, never mind. Apparently, that's more than just the one coin. I'm really that hungry. Could you hear my stomach grumbling? I don't feel hungry, but I guess my stomach is used to eating a lot. Oh, what the hell? What the hell was that? Hello, Justin. That is SMG5, the legendary Son Goku. Dude, fucking Son Goku is in chat. Let me figure out the door spacing that we use in this level. That's a bad example. 50 units. Okay. This doesn't feel like 50 units. Too many objects. You saw the HUD disappearing. I don't think it's too many objects, but something definitely is wrong with the coin formation. Although it is true that too many coin formations will cause a weird crash. What's this UV mapping? You are looking at the collision map. It has garbage UV mapping.  It's done. Oh, I have a bounty with the Goombas and a Trenchcoat half. I would say we just put wanted dead or alive on without a bounty. Nope. Even without that, that fucking dies. Interesting. So it's not the coin formations. Wait, I didn't even kill the coin formations. What am I doing? I meant to kill them. Three coins, one for each. It's five Goombas and a Trenchcoat. Or maybe three. I think five though. The HUD is still flickering. It's still crashing. Actually, it should be. No, now that I think about it, it needs to be Detect Channels. I'm pretty sure it's both the coins and Detect Channels. Detect Channels shouldn't work right now because the geometry is different. It should be iterating over invalid vertices and they should just cause a crash like that. Yeah, that's why I don't want them to have a bounty because I don't want that to add to the coin counter. Yeah, okay. It was Detect Channels. We need to remake the texture animations. That's what's going on here. Oh, the anchor looks bad. Let's see why the anchor looks so bad. Did you do the lighting and vertex colors thing again? You did. You can't have that. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. What do you use GIMP for if you have Photoshop? Photoshop has a few issues that GIMP doesn't. So that's when I use GIMP. It's a bit stupid that I have to. You can use that epic ray tracing. Yeah, but it has to be like this. Why? You can't have lighting and vertex colors at the same time. And you need vertex colors. No, you need lighting to do nth mapping. That's the issue here. I see what you wanted to do. We can't do this in the two second material. But it would only be brightness here. We'd have to use shade color alpha here. There we go. There we go. The thing is that the vertices only store either vertex color or the direction the vertex is facing. So if you already have one, you can have the other. Is this something you want, Biobak? Does that look good? Fuck you. How to cry like a motherfucking baby. Okay, I think someone needs to ban that guy. I just clicked on that link and it's just his YouTube channel, I think. It needs to match the green. Okay, I see. I have to change this texture then. No, I didn't mean to open that. Can't ban that, I'm not mad. Damn it. I'm not on Twitch. This good? I think this is good. There we go. It basically looks just like before, except now it works on N64. Mods. All right. Right, we also need to move the cutscenes up. All the cutscene splines are wrong. How much did you move the ship up by, like 200 coordinates? It said something in the changelog here. Prolix 700. See, you can't even say YouTube is better for multistreaming. Really? That's crazy. I thought I'm not even allowed to interact with YouTube at all. All right, that's enough for today. I'm going to go finish my workout. I think I'll see you guys next week. I'm going to probably have to standby then. I'll show you guys some of these on my Case Clips YouTube channel, if you want to see it. But I'll see you guys next stream. Bye bye.
