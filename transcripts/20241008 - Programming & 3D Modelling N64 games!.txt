Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello, hello, X links. Welcome to the stream. Hello, Marinova. Welcome to the stream. Hello. What's up in. Someone. No first for you to. For you to go. Hello my Cuba. What's wrong. Just one more rework bro and we'll all be fixed. Now this one's worth it. Have you seen the level Leela. Do you know what it looks like now after the rework. You would agree that this was a good idea. You sound like an addict. So our mission today is fixing the Goombas fight. Biobak wanted to make a few changes to it. And I'm up for it. So I already did the spikey Goombas but there's a little bug with them. So they come up here they get kicked and now we fight them and the bug is. Right there. You see how it just kind of disappears for a bit. That is the problem. Hello Sage Chowzu. What the fuck is going on there. You see how it kind of like teleports up. That is my problem here. I'm not sure why it happens. It's like there is one moment in the face angle pitch where this graph just goes crazy. It's probably this. If I had to guess. Where does this face angle pitch go. We'll do this. That should do it. Hello Sarah. Yes it is afternoon. Any OST wishes for today. I want something good. Trying to fix right now. We are doing the Goomba boss fight. Biobak wanted some changes to it. And I like his proposals. Also we need to reimport that Goomba King with the proper animations. Missing link OST. Let's do it. Let's do it. Yeah he needs the animations still. There were a bunch of fixes I did off stream. Oh Leela Leela Leela Leela. Leela. Look at this. Mipmaps. I did it. Can you guys see the mipmaps? You can probably see it kinda here. It's hard to see the mipmaps but that's good. Do you like him Biobak? Do you know what they are? Do you know why they are here? I don't know. Oh N64. I can do that. I fixed a lot of N64 bugs this past 2 days. So when the lights work again. I had a really stupid bug with the macro. And um... And... Right I fixed a crash in this area here. Okay but you know what they are. But do you know why they are? Like what they're for? Looks like there's an N64. It's still um... A little fucky wucky I'd say. I don't know if that's the case. Thank you Xlinks. I also fixed the lights on N64. Okay yeah that's perfectly right Biobak. I don't know if that's the case.  I thought that was more like a tech person thing to know. So yeah these lights work correctly now too on N64. Isn't that nice? I also tried to implement a bloom effect. Let me show you my attempt at implementing a bloom effect. You guys tell me what you think. What do you think of my bloom effect? Oh no! I mean it is brighter you have to admit that. Looks good to me true. Alright let me make sure the goombas work fine now. Hello Aleste. Oh that's perfect. Just what I wanted. Alright time for the Goomba King. Why does he have only one leg up? Doesn't he have both legs up? Wait now you're scaring me. Does Spike Goomba only has one leg up? I don't know. That's a weird animation. I feel like this is not what Zayna wanted. It should probably end here right? Like so? Why is the Goomba sideways? Yeah. Is this the wrong Goomba King? This is the wrong Goomba King. I don't know. I can make them point up at the end. No issue. Fine I'll do it. There we go. There I hope everyone is happy with this. We can get sideways Goomba to the game. The Goomba King is a sideways Goomba. Look. There we go. The Goombas from Fortnite. Of course the Goombas from Fortnite. I'd be happy if you made me $100. No. Let me just make sure this looks correct now. That I exported it. Why is the animation table like that? Fast64 did that. Yes. I'm dual streaming to both at the same time. Okay. Animation looks good. It just needs closed eyes. And the bubble needs to be correct. There we go. It's very fast, is it not? Hello Wimps. Can Blender be used for export? Really cool how you can just use Blender. It's called Fast64. I think you should leave his eyes closed. When I was a kid my cousin told me that she can sleep with her eyes opened. So I think you're wrong. My cousin is the Goomba King? She might be. Can we get an unoptimized version of this game? Sure. There's many things I can do. Doesn't mean I will do them. I don't like how this doesn't sync to the animation. Looks very poopy. Oh. We're getting this from here. Interesting. We probably don't want to multiply the frame count or something. Nope, that's the Goomba King model from Biobak. I'm starting to get comments from people on my YouTube channel that are like, why are you still talking about Mario 64? You've made enough Mario 64 videos.  And it's like, why are you guys watching my channel? What are you expecting to see on my channel other than Mario 64? Why are you following my channel in the first place if it wasn't Mario 64? You know what I mean? And then even worse, the ones like, oh, we get it. Back then, they just had stricter deadlines and in the video where I'm talking about how they put in more work to make the game worse, it's like, oh, they had stricter deadlines. They couldn't have not done that. It's like, no, they could very well have not done that. It would have saved them time. It was 1996. They couldn't have known. Oh, City Circus. Why the fuck are there always clowns here? It's also like that people don't understand that I'm making a game. They think I'm just making videos. And I just ignore the negative comments. But I mean, I am like 99% ignoring them. I'm just talking about it on stream right now. Because I find that to be an interesting thing to point out. It's not like they affect me in any way. I'm not that kind of emotional person. No. I'm the kind of person who will purposefully attract negative comments just to get feedback. And then I will use that feedback to improve my work. Yeah. My video plan. Hopefully this Saturday, the BLJ video. Then hopefully two to three weeks after that is a video just gonna be titled like so about that N64 game I've been working on or something like that. Where I tell people, hey, my channel I'm not actually trying to make the optimized vanilla Mario 64. I'm making my own game. That's why I'm doing this. Because a lot of people don't seem to understand that. And where I will also be talking about why I'm not showing as much progress on the main channel. It's because of society. Because no one wants to watch those previews. And then maybe another three weeks after that it will be the missing link version updates that Zell is working on. I'm just gonna pay him to do it. Is he blowing a bubble as he's inhaling or is it just me? You might be right about that. ...       The secret reason why I've been rewriting Mario 64. Oh, that's a good one. Oh-ho-ho-ho. ... ... ... I like the title more than mine. ... The title will do better than mine. ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...     ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Is the hands of him that's true i have absolutely seen people saying this is canon to them and as if it's official i have seen people believe it's official before i have seen it i can't believe my twitch and youtube strength is helping me be evil clickbait works because i watched a video called i remade mario 64 that had millions of views and all the comments are just saying how shit the video is because there's two seconds of unreal remake scene and the rest is talking about how the remake would be if he remade it that's so funny because someone sent me that video and told me how cool they think it is it should look decent need to not click my lantern i don't believe you i don't understand what's wrong with this this seems very reasonable to me  is it like you using solid colors to do textures or something uh i am not sure why that crashed so no it doesn't take any ram at all the reason to have solid colors of textures is so you mark which surfaces you've already assigned while also having very clear current differences in it right i sometimes use solid materials i mean i guess my collision maps are no secret but if you look at the main area where the collision map is a little more complicated you can instantly see like i have a solid color here for this slippery wood then i have just one wood that i use everywhere so it's all the same material for sure right this makes sense i mean this was music zero volt clicking the romhack potion at 3am i do want to make a mr beast video for the next april first i'm still planning this i have this as like a hundred percent plan in my mind and it's just gonna be i hacked every n64 game in one day eow hack two likes two likes on gamebanana you're a millionaire parker civilization would also go hard but to do that decently it's too much work dude i'm gonna be 29 in like two weeks that's fucking crazy is this just a melody nope is something wrong with this animation yeah by the time parker civilization video is done it's already not gonna be that relevant anymore so okay so it is animation seven that's causing the crash how literally how zero one two three four five six am i fucking stupid i counted that three times what the fuck isn't it crazy that hawk tour survived pop culture longer than parker civilization do you guys think i should go on to talk to a podcast i think that would significantly boost my popularity hawk tour 64 extra time just make a video announcing that hawk tour girl will officially be playable in rty64 you don't know either of those references that is crazy you are so lucky that you don't use the internet very much and a bit see it's curved popularity like like that so an imaginary force that people just mock it i don't know i remember the day after suddenly i saw it everywhere and people generally thought they were putting creative and hilarious spins on the girl saying hawk tour and was the same shit as every single thing ever i think the first day or two people were being genuine about it and now they are ashamed that they were being genuine about it hello lion voice did not want to be an elon mead writer wait what what the fuck is this code what's the die animation look like it's probably just this one here right so say a separate die animation hello tea time i don't think he did a dying animation well he doesn't actually die it's just that the old animation was called dying so let's see it from above the loops from 140. to 14. are those the same frames we got 140 here and 14 here oh they're not quite the same it was enough to just do this hello kyle how's the video going we were already planning we're talking about the next video and the title and Biobak had great ideas so instead of the video that would just be called like what that n64 game i've been working on Biobak's idea was the secret reason i've been rewriting mario 64 which is just insane dude that title goes hard instead of the zelda mod nintendo doesn't want you to know about his title idea was the zelda game nintendo tried to hide from you and that's also really fucking hard those videos just now went from like the one thing i thought was going to be 80 000 views i think just from the title change alone 300 000 the other one i thought maybe like 150 000 views title change i think 400 000 i mean rendering the exhibition free that you would like to use yes but emulator why super mario 64 is horrible and i'm fixing it oh that wouldn't do well people would give me a lot of hate for that one kick needs new animation is what it says wait there's no kick animation no it's exclusive to n64 what's on the list you sent shit oh i guess this comment stays then run away unused interesting so all right let's see how this works out there should be everything except the wait i never exported the walk forward animation how's that make animation nice there's always nle yeah but i'm not designing for lle so maybe i'm doing a few things i'll be getting to the fun part soon and i want this to be the best project yet okay that sounds exciting but like i said i imagine that the the blj video just will not do well i just think that the title and concept is not interesting enough but i mean if you want to try that's fine it's even better i definitely won't complain all right i'm gonna have a separate walk forward animation here that should be animation eight so everything except the kick animation should be done what's the blj title i don't have a title yet maybe how the blj really works would you do this if nintendo went after you it's just hijacking a plane and flying it into the nintendo headquarter switch muncher was super nintendo did nothing wrong but then they would stop selling them going to sell them anyway and then it had a suit but it's currently oh okay this animation is looping which is an issue sorry i had to write on someone on twitter there's um some stuff going on with nintendo takedowns and a lot of people are very worried about it oh what the fuck oh i guess he never stopped stalking because he's always stuck in there oh i see okay all right that's very exciting well i guess editing the video you will perfectly understand blj's then why would you not get a lawyer because lawyers are very expensive so but it's fucking nintendo well maybe he doesn't have the money i imagine someone who spends their life like developing hacking software doesn't really have a job these are all like the youtube slop titles that you would see right if i go onto youtube onto my start page i'm gonna see a bunch of titles like that i'm a bit worried that making a title like that will put it into the youtube slop buckets and not into this oh this is actually interesting stuff bucket you know the youtube slop of like can you beat mario 64 or no more like can you beat mario karts without items or like is it possible to beat mario 64 without touching the red it feels like that i only ever looked a little bit at x86 assembly so and it does not want you to do this mr 64 yeah it's the the type of video where it's like i'm eating my lunch and i don't know what to do while i'm eating my lunch so i'm watching this this needs to be a moment lunch slop playlist exactly absolutely agree to kyle you need the title and thumbnail to get the foot in the door and then you need the video to like get the watch time and have this be recommended to more people right so you need both they're kind of multiplicative with each other i think there's pain of programming oversight it's too generic for my channel my half my entire channel is more 64 is fatal programming oversight you know what i mean okay it's walk animation is good but a little too fast i think it should scale with how much she actually moves wow also the two goombas on the ceiling are missing now what the fuck the image need to be redone if you change the gameplay he's gonna have an idle animation and a walk animation right and we need the walk animation anyway it's a dragon ball game i'm not sure nope hey you only scaled up seven times so so so 100 to 14 or 199 we are going to learn any headers will result in an extremely large bump on your hat true that do me what it looks like so i don't know if you guys saw this but there was um this is why i even did this in the first place the bloom filter here look at this this is so cool looking Right? It's a really expensive effect. The guy that made this set, it cost him 7 milliseconds of RDP time. Mario Kart Wii has graphics, that's exactly what I thought too. But if it's only 7 milliseconds, it is usable in sub-areas that are really close to perfect. Nope, I'm not really involved in any toolchains. Hey, you thought you knew about BLG's is wrong. But that title is too close to just literally a lie territory. I want to get views, I don't want to be branded as slob. Alright. It's either 0 views or the slob. I don't think so. I think there is a middle ground here. So good. I hate my phone. You can try to get into RDRomGame if it's like a pain of experience. If you have Dcom and Fast64 I'm sure it's good. And yeah it's good, it's on slob. You get good titles and thumbnails but don't deliver any content. But there is still a certain aesthetic associated with it. That is a funny idea Nova, but forgot them. I can actually think of a way to implement that too without costing anything while it's not active. Man. It's messed up. Okay, so it was still printing something for some reason. It must be this here. So all I was really missing from the Goomba was the kick. Let's recap on how we want the fight to work. What was the idea? You want the Goomba to pick a place. He just walks there. And then the boulder follows Mario. Not the other way around. So you have to aim the boulder at him. Okay. From 64 sequel. Yeah, probably. But I don't wanna. Stream YouTuber. I love that. Only a side note. If you walk into this dark forest, you will die. Sloppy doesn't really matter. I guess. But I don't know. The title sounds like a video that no one would actually click on because they want to click on it. They would only click on it because they want to not be bored while eating the lunch. Whereas if you say how the BLJ really works, someone might click on it because they genuinely want to know about how the BLJ works. I love how shitty the JCS clones are. They all just, they love stating confidently incorrect or unprovable garbage about body language. And that's my favorite. Generally looks like a TikTok content farm. And you see this missed run. Top five. Vengeful scary movie. What creature brutally attacked these men in the forest? That actually does look terrible. Such as evil. Featured audiences only. Well, it's not even clickbaity. It's just so boring. So goddamn boring. Couldn't click twice, which means he secretly admits to murdering his mother. Yeah, that counts as a right to beat him to subservience. Let's see how this works out. I think you'd end up with a much different audience if you go in that direction. Yeah, that too. I mean, it is self-evident that if you blink twice, you kill your mom. I can never control my blood thirst after blinking twice. Well, I guess we are onto the Link to the Past enhanced soundtrack. Now, why does this not generate new positions? I could have just gotten really unlucky. That is possible. I think I want to just make sure that's not it, because I don't see a bug in the code. I just have to have been unlucky. Unless there's something else that I can... Oh, Max. He moved over there. Is he moving? I can't tell. Is he just moving so slowly? He's definitely moving, right? What the fuck? I'm probably going to have a dirt effect after the goomba hits the ground. Yeah, yeah, I agree. I'm looking at the right code. Wait. This is why. It generated numbers between 0 and 1, not between minus 1 and 1. Like I initially thought. That would do it. How does this function work here? Because I just realized this might be very improvable. Do I want to improve this? Hmm. Is it actually fast not to... Just go like... Wait, that's diameter? I have never used this as diameter. I've always used this as radius.  I'm going to keep using this as radius. I think this is a little faster. Hello, Thomas. That is way too far.  Cool. Oh. This is why. And the guy was moving too far forward. Which I can change by increasing this number. Get stuck on the stairs. Hello, Jesus Bono Paris. Okay, now we got a number around 0. Okay, he's moving as he wants. As he's supposed to be. Okay, interesting. So... Because he got hit mid-kick animation, some stuff went wrong. I think. That is weird. I just wonder where it went wrong. Okay. This should be fine. Right, the boulder goombas. They are not working. That's probably why. What's up with the boulder goombas? Hello, Judy Testa. I am glad you are enjoying shitposting here. I don't see why they would not be here. Unless it's a drawing distance thing. Oh yeah, did you guys notice I fixed the overworld knights? Isn't that nice? I moved a bit of stuff around. Doesn't really require much change. No, I still don't see those boulder goombas. Those spike goombas also still need shadow. Just like the king fight. Should be the same here. I actually don't see why they would be disappearing. Unless they are inside the building now. They were 140 coordinates inside the building. I feel like that's a project that's already been done like literally half a dozen times. It's like the Mario 64 beta where everyone is trying to do it at some point for no reason. Did I understand? Hey, there's the goombas. He should probably be idle while he's just standing there doing nothing. Okay, so the goombas still get stuck there. Which we can fix by just editing the geometry a little bit. Because all this is inaccessible anyway. Yeah, this is the ignore collision layer. Oh, fuck. Fellas, can we talk about movie games? Games that are made about movies. There's something so goofy about them. They all feel so similar. We tried to play the Pirates of the Caribbean movie game. And I mean, that was obviously extremely, extremely boring. But what baffled me the most is how uninspired it was. There's so much movie material you could use, but they just didn't. And then there was gambling and the gambling was banger. The gambling was the best part of the game. So the movie game, I didn't even know that existed. The LEGO games do it okay. Interesting. But a lot of the game was just like, here is the locations from the movie. And you get to mash the A button while you're standing in the movie scene. Yeah. The gameplay was hold the remote and do this. And you win. But then there was gambling and the gambling was actually really fun. And the gambling was the game they play in the movie, which fair enough. How do you mess that up? You didn't. It's almost finished. Can you make a blender level? Not anything good. I don't know make the game. I'm not good at making visuals either. I Can just I'm just gonna do me mapping on a swing Spider-man movie. Okay, the spider-man games were actually insane though back in the day, weren't they? I Saw my cousins play them when I was a kid and they looked pretty good Here's one spider-man movie game. Oh, there was a PCS one one Oh What the fuck Can shadow radius not be bigger than 255 Oh, that's fine He had a lot of cool moves, yeah, I imagine that's the most important part We Okay, that looked literally perfect also the shadow is here now nice How I forgot to make the boulder wait the boulder also goes too far It Just rolls too far Two five two two five two is all I need Interesting Hello several Robi, I'm glad you like it Okay, I keep saying this but if you want to be successful making video games you need to be mentally unwell That is 100% the prerequisite You need to be completely insane. It's gonna help You will End up with like creative block at some point or you will end up having to do things You don't want to do you will end up having to make like compromises You will end up having to work on a feature. That's really sucks to work on and you're just gonna have to keep doing it You just can't be like well, can I do it? Let's just do it Oh, there's no reward in it for me doing this, but I gotta And then you just do it You Be having fun making games is doing it wrong. Yeah, I'm kidding What the hell is this Something is very wrong with the way this boulder works I stayed the ranks tilt here. I Need to try to be a million volts my game will be successful just keep working Just be like at your PC and you say I'm not allowed to talk to anyone or get up or do anything until I'm done Implementing this feature and then you just do it You We think it pushed by goombas Okay, well I guess this is this is the right one Hmm So, I guess this is just too high And the goombas hit them too fast So Thanks until you realize you can just do the thing you told us I'm not to do and nothing bad will happen Okay, but you will be disappointed in yourself you Okay, you have to implement the punishment system too if you mess that up you have to go to bed with socks on or Something I don't know You You Pretty disappointed myself by default. Oh, well, that sucks The other thing is it doesn't just bother me sometimes I do well I mean if you ever think that you also have to keep in mind that Well, yes, you have two parents four grandparents eight great-grandparents 16 great-great-grandparents 32 great-great-great-grandparents, right? So you probably have like billions of ancestors So if you ever think your ancestors are disappointed in you, just keep in mind there is billions of them disappointed in you And probably the entire bloodline of those billions of people is gonna end with you if you don't have children But no pressure I Unless I'm good Since he's a drug addict and abusive great awesome those kids great start to life That sucks Yeah, that's good I'm gonna call them goombies. Yes, that's what the code says I'm saying shouldn't matter what matters is you think of yourself. What does the word matter mean in this context? I Guess clearly in some way what other people think of you influences the real world You Know it fell too far again. Okay, maybe 17 is for maybe 16 Wanted to see if they're talking more with the bloom effect But no plus look like that. So do you think we should implement the bloom for something? Maybe? Maybe there's like a stage in the future. We can use it I feel like the casino could have it somehow or nothing as you know, the space arcades Thing that I'm rule multiples you think to make sense a little compressor are on either side of the boulder. Yeah, that's the plan I'm just missing it up I Said the boulder comes here and then once the mold is there the goombas come there and Then the goombas are supposed to be pushing the boulder eventually But they just run past it for some reason Right and then the goombas are gonna be moving the boulder left and right You You You I guess I can't use oval X. I can just use Opal sex though Which honestly makes more sense anyway You But it should be on the goombas, I think I prefer this Why is there no one else referring to them as the goombas here and my codes unbelievable You And then each of them pushes it by five when that way both of us can push it and it kind of looks like Pushes faster when both goombas are here So that's cool, too And then What the fuck is this oh This this the spike goomba oops There we go This means the thing and at most move just a few coordinates shit You Yeah, no one was relatively close to Mario, I hope It was still the issue of they didn't actually try to approach the boulder so much which I don't like You There's a b-perm here's the knots One zero perfect What if gargoyles one of your tax gargoyle and these nuts Thank you for playing You We got another one guys As I'm speaking English, you know, bro has Internet Explorer in the taskbar, yep You never know when you might need it Nice you speak German. I also speak German The para goombas need obj in it after spawn I just realized You Huh, why are you just talking past you asshole I Might a session of the German plane, but I also sucked in English brings you had to speak Spanish What do you mean a session does your mom do She assessor sessions with Germans The most common languages you'd learn in Germany after English would be French or Latin But I think Spanish is an option too for most people I have very polite sounding German. I Think I have very formal sounding German I Okay, so this never happens for some reason session sounds kind of sus I agree Do no don't make jokes on my marriage if you just don't know what to call it I am going to make jokes about your mom You I need to send the screenshot to Arthur. He's gonna have a session with your mom She does those can't wait your mom reads like parrot cards Your mom is one of those people that are like, oh I can see the Jupiter is really messing with your week Dude I'm so sorry Leela. I will never make fun of you again. Life has punished you enough as is Oh my kiss your mom reads tarot cards Yeah, her mom is a fortune teller that's the words I Know reading fortune cards is very sus. I think But I bet it makes a good money so honestly Psychic medium. Yeah, that sounds like that I Could that is into this as well what Do people come up to her Leela and ask her what number on the roulette they should bet all their money on That's what I would do if I talked to a fortune teller Bring a gun ask them to play Russian roulette with you. Let's prove your fortune telling ability I Are there doing it online, she's robbing the casino blind Have you guys ever been on instagram rials all instagram units is when I go on there just like clips of sonic adventure one animation, where something says something random and then sing something in chinese or it's sub by surfer gameplay on the bottom and then ai generated joe rogan podcast at the top telling me to go gamble or drink and drive it's only those that makes sense later oh this time it's necessary oh no did you talk to a witch and get her cursed Oh, the Goombas are pushing the boulder. And then they're going back without shooting it off, cool. It's slowly dropping lore. It's good lore. So the next thing he told me, I took care of it. She should be all right now. So I asked him what he did, told him nothing illegal, he said it was a straight face. Last night I was lying in bed and I closed my eyes and concentrated as hard as I could to send him all the negative messages I could. Oh my God, that's like this chance level of deluded. What the hell? That is actually insane. Negative vibe blast. Yeah. Lying in bed at night sending me negative vibes. Dude, that's so sad. Fucking rip. Not the negative vibes gun. I need to fix the Paragomba thing. There we go. Can we do the same with positive vibes? I'm sure he does that every night to his children. And that's why Biobak has such a good life. He's getting it with the positive vibes gun. But like, okay, you have to juxtapose the extremity of my husband abuses me with the naive innocence of I'm sending him negative vibes. He actually got sick and left there shortly after. So he's convinced it works. Okay, it works. I'm convinced. Sending all my bad vibes to whom? He does paid Wi-Fi healing sessions, but he actually believes it though. That's crazy. If you guys ever seen the guy that believes he can build a force field with his hands to win street fights, fight the actual MMA guy, and he just gets the shit beaten out of him. I'll admit guys, my mom also went to like one of those Wanda healers once because she has like an issue that no doctor could help her with. And she just wasted a bit of money. And I told her that was stupid. You wasted your money. That's it. Do you have more time to work on a project or just pushing it to get more done? Neither honestly. I just wanted to stream more. Okay, I want the Goomba King more likely to be not in the middle of the area when he does this. Just so that it's harder to accidentally hit him. That's like, do you guys know that wind comes from trees moving around a lot? It's because if you ever look outside and it's winding, you will see the trees move. In case I hydrate, I will hydrate. We don't need this anymore. All right, we really only need the cake animation now. And then I have to change the kit on, right? This bad Goomba is done, done. This is done. Oh, and the boss doors. Okay, but if your dad is doing this professionally and he still believes it, then he must have at least historically had success sometimes. And it's probably not better than random chance. But this is funny. I just, dude, Biopic's dad sounds like a small child to me right now. I just hope he never just like gets someone who has cancer and fucking dies and believes and loses like his belief in his magical powers. You know what I mean? It's like I'm talking to Peter Pan. Stop being morbid. Oh, my God, I'm not being morbid. That's a genuine concern. Dude, imagine he would have to lose his career. They die on the zoom. Okay, I wasn't saying that. Did you know I learned this recently? This is the same as the square of distribution. And again, we have one like this one additional. Please. Sorry about this. What? Which part of this? Oh, you mean like an angry animation? Like where he just like jumps and plays when he's angry? Is that a vital? Dude, I hate when people do that, Lila. Oh, my God. No, sugar physics. You like him? I forgot the word angry. I googled rats. I'm up for an angry animation. I'm going to write Zayna the animations we need. And then I'm going to close this and send Zayna the newest file. There we go. Well, we've only been doing N64 compatible hacks for four years. And I've only tried to make them run well for three years. And the golf ball boss Iceberg also needs to sleep. Yes. And autocorrected Goomba to goofball. Do you say goofball a lot? Yes. So I go over here, which makes the Goombas carry the boulder here. And then they drop him right on his head. Except they didn't actually shoot the boulder. Why would the boulder not go? Oh, because we just need to set the action to two. Okay. Already set the action to two. What the hell? Okay. Because this hasn't happened yet. Okay. Maybe like this. And then we still need the boss doors. I completely forgot. Okay. Aiming and go. Hey. Oh, but the directions are inverted. All right. All that's missing now is the two animations, which I'm not going to be working on. And the boss doors. That open up when the Goomba is angry. And we somehow make his disappearance look more natural. So right now he just kind of moves out. Which I don't like. Okay. And this area here might run close to 60. I haven't measured it. Less than 2,000 is when he disappears. Yeah, which is too early. Should be like 2,500 or 2,600. And then in the collision map, we're going to have to extend this. This way. Also in the collision map, we don't need any of this. Because it doesn't do anything. This is a bizarre collision map, isn't it? I can turn this into one triangle. And I can remove these if I really wanted to. Extend this instead. It really is literally no need for this. This saves like three bytes of RAM size. And that's literally the only upside. Actually, also, this is a very, very minor FPS boost. Oh, wow. Why not, I guess? I guess similarly, we can remove this stuff here. Actually, it's better to remove that stuff. Because that won't stop the spike goombas from jumping over the fence. Now, the goomba king should disappear through the wall. Which is good. All right. Did you make a separate file for the doors Biobak? Or do I need to download that? I need to download them again. Because I removed them from the model. Oh, actually, they should be in here. Complaining about the UI again? What do you think of it? I mean, I would like there to be a new UI. But it needs to be a UI that makes sense. We can't just be like, oh, here is the 3D world UI. There you go. It has to be like, here is a UI that is a natural evolution of Mario 64's UI. What the fuck? I don't have the saved as the file here. I don't. Okay, I need to download the file again. Biobak, do you still have it? I fear it's not going to be on WeTransfer anymore. Unless... I still have the file locally somewhere. Mario 64 in the S3 and 64 in the major. Complaining about the game with the controls. That's obviously been suggested a lot of times. And if I had infinite time, I would eventually make that. But I do not have infinite time. Don't worry, I found the file locally. Hello, excellent gamer. That is very late. How am I supposed to do this one? Biobak? Wait. Does this need two separate models? Does the shadow need to fade in? There should be door files though. Huh? Castle door. Okay, how am I supposed to do this? Is the shadow supposed to fade in? I never recreated Wreck Room though. Wait, what is Wreck Room? Maybe I did. Okay, so the shadow needs to fade in, cool. Awesome. How am I supposed to do this? I never recreated Wreck Room though.  I never recreated Wreck Room.  Is the shadow supposed to fade in? There should be door files though. Wait, what is Wreck Room? I never recreated Wreck Room. Why did that happen? Leila? Help? What happened? I renamed the alpha layer into the core layer and the core layer into the alpha layer and then everything just went purple. It's a button? Which one? The material tab? That one? Huh? What did you do? I just renamed the tabs here. What the hell? Huh? I think I found a bug. I did already create this and the texture is set. And it's even a valid texture. And it shows here. Ah! I don't know what's going on. Why did it switch to that? No Ctrl Z doesn't fix the issue. Either way, I will fade the shadow in like this and I think that's good. Is this what you want, Buyback? Shadow fades in like this? Shwoop. Absolutely perfect. Alright. I'll be honest though, I'm feeling kinda exhausted for today. I think this will be finished another day. Or right after streaming. I think I'm just exhausted of streaming. Ugh. So I'll be seeing you guys next stream. Most likely the next stream will be on Saturday. So until then, bye bye!
