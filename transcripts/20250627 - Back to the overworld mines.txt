Hello, hello, hello? Hello? Hello, Droidzica, hello, Mimosky. Today might be an overworld programming kind of day. Who's pinging me? Hello, Lord Njitterjaga. I've been doing a lot of work on course 2 off-stream. I've been making sure everything works, bug fixing stuff, improving things. I think I'll be done with it by the end of the week. Hopefully I can get my course 7 test done soon. Well, this is on the wrong... There we go. Hello, baby Yoichi. Yeah, we might just have to re-export this level here. Yep, we gotta make clean. So, we have to program the overworld soon. And if we put every piece of content that we thought to put into the game into the game now, we would end up with 200 stars and 193 stars. Obviously, that's not a very round number. So, I am thinking that while we finish the rest, we are probably finding seven more stars we want to put into the overworld. At least I wouldn't be surprised. Holy scope creep, how? How is it scope creep? Oh, I mean, maybe it's a little bit of scope creep. We started with a hack that had planned to have like 185 stars and now we have 193. I guess we scope creep like a couple stars. Is it really an issue though? So, the mob to the next area here is actually... Oh yeah, I finished all this off stream. You guys haven't even seen this. It's not the prettiest, but it works for now. That's some nice alpha transitions here. I have seen your application for beta in my emails. Unfortunately, I don't want an email for a beta test applications. I'm supposed to fill out the beta test application form. You know, how many stars do you think I actually done right now in the game? It's probably like 140. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, there is genuinely 44 extra stars. It's weird how it's sampling twice. Beta test form. Pogo's pinned it. Hello Samuel. Your mom give you... wait, why did your mom take your laptop? What did you do? This is great news for fast64 development though. Let's fucking go. No, it doesn't shush. No, what else are you gonna do? You're gonna multitask browsing YouTube and Twitter at the same time. Come on, actually blue sky at the same time. I know you're a dirty little blue sky user. I'll play Shadow Gems. What if this is fucking Samitizer again? It's not. Okay, we might be all good. Yo, they put the Elder Scrolls Remaster on sale. Let's fucking go. I'm not planning to do anything with YouTube right now. We're still thinking about it. There is a good chance we can make a split screen multiplayer work. Again, there's the question, what do we do with dialogue? When one player talks to a character, everything kind of freezes. What do we do there? Someone suggested what happens is that player screen is full screen and both players can read it at the same time. Then there's the question, what do we do for stuff that only works with one player, such as the Raven boss fight or the Mario Land Plain section? Someone suggested that the players swap whenever you get hit, which I think that's also a thing solved. And then there's a lot of other weird things where it's like, it needs Mario to interact with, you know? Like, are we just going to use the closer Mario brother every time? I think that would work. Instead of G Mario states, we always read G closest player state. A friend actually called me out. Yo, wait, a friend? Dude, Leela has multiple friends. I'm so glad for you. This sounds like a diss, but I am glad you have friends in real life. I think that's not common anymore in the year 2024. I'll be girl messing Saturday again. You love grass, dude. This is great news for you. But this is terrible news for Fast64 development. All right, so today we will be programming the overworld. I need an OST, dude. Let me thank this guy first for letting me know. Fucking, OK, I got pinged by Sam. No way. We will be having AI friends. True. So what do we need? We need a bop to bunny brushwoods. Beat Pachyderm with a ground punch around past him or pay him coins to come and let them let you through. OK, we need Pachyderm for that. Temple door as a standard, collect the star and the door opens itself. OK, so we need the temple door. And then with the cannon at part four exit. OK, so we need to put the warp for this. Let's begin working on performance. I feel like you're already pushing this game pretty far up. Do we just disable all the visualizations like foliage and whatnot? Um, there is advantages and disadvantages to having split screen performance wise. So the first thing that's going to happen is your screen is usually four to three, right? So once you cut that in half, you're kind of left with what? Eight to three. But we want 16 to nine. So eight to three is the same as 16 to six. So there's actually like space on the sides that you can leave empty and you have 16 to nine resolution. So you will have like a widescreen resolution. 160 by no, not 160, 120 by fucking what is the number? Divide by 16, multiply by nine. A thousand eighty fucking I don't know. You will have widescreens, basically two widescreens, but with less pixels. And that's because you have black bars at the rims. So the black bars being there means you render less pixels, which makes it a lot cheaper to render. Yes, that is also an issue, Lila. I think multiplayer is probably going to drop an RSP on 30 FPS level to 20 FPS. But 20 FPS on the N64, honestly, is it that bad? Ocarina of Time was 20 FPS. No one was picking an OST, so I'm picking it. Yes, I think we're fine. I mean, I think you're right that the performance is going to be rough. I will agree with that. I don't think it will be rough to the point where it's unplayable though. Keep in mind, we don't have to literally render everything twice because of MadStackFix, many things are going to be the same. I have never lied like that. That must be a misunderstanding. So I actually thought it would be a fun experiment to try and only say things in the way where they are objectively true. Because sometimes people complain about you saying things that are objectively true because you're being hyperbolic or whatever. Just to see whether people will think you're insane. And I think they will think you're insane very fast. I used to say that sent me a video. Probably of the baby. I don't want to see the baby right now. So if co-op with bad performance, then no co-op? Yeah. Well, there are performance implications for a single player. Where if you support co-op, your single player is going to get slightly slower too. But I think we can just eat that. I'm not putting 480p mode in because that means I have to support the memory allocation for that. And that's not reasonable. Isn't that the premise of the Vulcans in Star Trek? I am not sure. I have not watched Star Trek. But it does sound like something that they would do to me. It would be fun for me to watch that and just figure out whether what he said is actually true. Objectively true. If you're trying to only say things that are objectively true, I think you have to ensure that everything you can say, you can prove to yourself somehow. You can't just be 99.9% sure. So if you were to say only things that are objectively true, I wouldn't be able to say something like the Antarctica exists. Because there is no way I can know that. Hello, Mr. Insecto. Good, now you're in the Vulcan spirit, I think. You get it. Hello, Nintendo for life. That's because the Antarctica doesn't exist. There's only the ice wall. I mean, you don't know that. At least I don't think you know that. I have to qualify that too, because there's a chance you know that. I wouldn't know. Let's run on Windows 95. I don't see why not. Dude, what are these behaviors? We don't need these fuckers behaviors. I think I want to remove all the vanilla behaviors that I know. Actually, all of the vanilla behaviors, not just the ones I don't use. Yes, Zayna, that's what we're listening to. Someone reverted my Hollow Earth here by saying that it technically has a liquid filling. Isn't that true? Waste a ton of data on your soul. Is it that bad? It feels pretty active to me. Hmm, which level is this? Wait, what? I don't know what that is. I don't know what that is either. It's not PSS. It's no way. It's a custom, right? It is. He's making fart noises, is she going... Do you think you're the most knowledgeable person in the world on the Tekken 7x64? And who else is out there with you? It really depends on what you count as being part of Mario 64, I believe. It's also hard for me to know. See, there is one person, DeathWizard. He rarely showcases what he does, but every now and then someone's talking about, oh I'm working on this cool new thing. And then DeathWizard just comes into the conversation going like, oh, you're trying to do that? I actually did this in spring of 2021. And it works like this. Look at it. And it's like, what the fuck? You didn't show this to anyone? You did this thing? It's cool. Do you mind you didn't show this to anyone? Yeah to make an FPGA you need to know a lot about the Nintendo 64. You don't need to know that much about Mario 64. They weren't talking specifically about Mario 64. If it's just like knowing about the N64, then clearly I am not the most knowledgeable person. I don't think my skills ever really been, you know, having the most knowledge on anything. I just have the skill to put stuff together, to make sensible decisions, and then good Hey, it works. The description is a resume ad basically, this isn't anything of the sort at all. That is not intentional and that sucks that it's doing that. I think I need to subscribe to them for like a premium thing to get rid of that, but I don't think it's worth it. And honestly them putting the ad there makes me want to use it less. It's kind of like a next screen, you know? You can't reward next screens if you want next screens to not be implemented in software. You're gonna be part of the problem. As Immanuel Kant would say, always act after the highest maxim that you want to become out of the accepted moral society or something like that. God, I hate Kant. Immanuel Kant's songs are there. I just didn't play in front of one coin for some reason. You heard that? Nah, man, I wish they sponsored me. Maybe I can, but it already looks like they're gonna be there for the rest of the game. Yeah, Biobak is actually working on reworking this one right now. He wanted a smaller mission. Let's link up that mob real quick. And when we are playing Sol, well, while you are in Mario house, there will be Luigi sleeping and then when you play it, it's supposed to be Luigi's awake. I haven't thought about specifics like that yet. For me, it doesn't make sense to think about specifics like that until we have more information about what we really want to do with Luigi. You guys know that Abraham Lincoln quote where it's like, if you ask me to cut down a tree in six hours, I'm actually not sure if this is the real quote. I've heard a false quote about him talking about gambling after this more often than I've heard the real quote. And I think I've heard the real quote about that today. And I'm not sure it's the real quote. Basically, if he had six hours to cut down a tree, he would spend four hours sharpening his axe, which is maybe not the most effective mindset to have, but it is a good showcase of the mindset we go into with this, where it's like we try to improve our tools, gather as much knowledge as possible, and then start the task so we can finish the task as fast as possible and get our good tools so we're better at the task the next time or something like that. That's kind of what we're doing. Oh, Biobak is working on a stage right now, so I don't want to actually fuck with that. Excited to see you blink again? I'm always blinking. You're feeding Biobak? Well, there are some legal issues right now, but don't worry, he will be paid. Ninja is running out of this point? I have no idea. I'm not well-versed on American precedence. Who is pinging me again? Oh, that's my editor. Nice. He's making the missing link video right now. I didn't get that. Cloudcap level entrance. The Mandarine! Mandarine randomly shows up here after beating Act 3 in Koopa Wave Golf. Okay. Let's see. This is a cliff by the beach. You can find a river as well that's linked to Divine Dino Main. That's here. Let's go back to this area, to the top of the cliffs. That's here. There's a long boardwalk for my ship to attach to, and lots of dunes. We have the boardwalk, we have the dunes. You can see the tide rise and fall here. We have that. There's a friendly cheep-cheep living in the water here that has a sign that he holds up to teach you the swim controls if you are in the water. Okay, we need to add that. Okay.  The missing link video. I'm making a missing link video where basically it's a version update, I talk about the design of the game, and then that's it. Okay. Let's start with Pack-E-Derm.  They crossed the outline. Is there not a 3D model of him anywhere? God damn. This is gonna be tough. Paper Mario? What is this? Oh, that's fucking cool. Sort of link to the model of Yoshi. I'll just kind of do your own thing. It's gonna be very Yoshi-coded. That is the current plan. Why is this guy so happy that I'm blinking? Huh? Does he think I'm like an android? Okay. Guys, I think I want laser eye surgery at some point in the future. Like... You're supposed to get absolute banger vision from that, right? Okay, we just need to make a model. No way around it. Let me start a complex monologue and don't play for Yoshi Island. No. You will miss some references to enemies and type. And then maybe Easter Eggs references. But... You should be able to enjoy it nonetheless. No problem, Lilo. I hope you enjoyed that blink. Ew, Scalabag? What a heathen. What a heathen. What a heathen. Yeah, I do think this game is more enjoyable if you've played Yoshi Island before, but... It really is optional content. Wait, is that evidence that I have just gotten a Nintendo sale? Maybe today, just because of me, Shigeru Miyamoto will have food on his plate. Oh, I see why he feels so wrong. The whole guy is a little fatter like this. You know what? Maybe I should just get a pear model. Wait a second, is this the play? Dude, he is pear-shaped. I should just use this. This is the perfect shape. Look at them. It's Pokemon Colosseum. Okay, I don't know what Tito is. But I know that Rovert and Arthur Tilly talk about it as though it was some kind of porn. So I'm not sure whether to engage with that or not. Are those two just completely degenerate? I don't know. This probably seems like the right shape. Uhh, what is this? 60 divided by 14? Well, no wonder I couldn't do that in my house. Because you know I'm not weird, right? Yeah, I believe you. Oh, I am willing to model a pear shape. It's just a lot easier if you have something like this already made for you. Oh, that's a pretty nice shape I think for the Pachyderm. I don't know. I don't know. This is gonna be his ears. Goddamn, he looks so fucked up. Do you see this? Oh my god. He definitely looks like an enemy from a Yoshi game. Like there's nothing else. Him selected in a toolbar? Ugh, what? No way. Top 5 Mario enemies? I don't have a top 5. Top 10 women.  I'm out of women. My wife, the only context I've ever heard Emilia Erhardt be mentioned in is shitting on women. So I did a model with AI and it's crazy good, modeling is dead, okay, show the model. I will tell you why it's terrible once I have the model. I'll just send it as an obj file somewhere, maybe on my discord. Yeah, I mean, I am excited for the possibility of AI to do the parts that I don't like doing, but I don't think we are anywhere near done. I can see how it looks like that from a consumer perspective, because a lot of what new AI innovation right now is to the market, it's just like, okay, here's the same shit, but scaled bigger. It's really new innovations, I think, but the mathematics involved in AI is still advancing pretty rapidly. There's nothing to say that as far as I'm aware, that AI isn't going to get way better just for different avenues. AI isn't all LLMs, right? LLM is just everything that the big companies are pushing right now. It sucks that AI has become like a mainstream topic. I prefer it when it was just like a thing that nerds cared about, because now that it's a mainstream topic, like a commercial thing, people are so delusional and annoying about it. Thank you, Brandon Mellon. But there's money to be made, there's a way, and LLM will take over everything. I don't see the slur, just because hardware with built-in addition matrix comes to the market, AI is going to have a fit, but you'll hate AIR, you mean because like training is going to get better? So, are they like nowhere near the point where AI training hardware is good yet? I don't know about these things, I just had assumed they were making reasonable decisions. ChatGPT be credited in your mind? No, I don't think it contributed anything. At least nothing that will make it into the game. Actually maybe a chat member like used ChatGPT and pasted it out for like brainstorming or whatever. What would I do at that point even? And I had to figure out how to do the maintenance math in addition rather than multiplication? No, I wouldn't have heard about that. Whenever there's like any new advancement in matrix math where it's like, we've managed to make it do 0.02 multiplications per dimension less, all we needed to add is 2000 additions. Someone's always on my Discord being like, Kates, have you heard about this? They made matrix math faster, maybe you can use this on your N64. So if they had done the matrix math without addition, I'm fairly confident I would have heard about it. I'm modeling a coconut guy. This is called, I think a Russell in English. And it's like at the trunk of an elephant. Maybe a cock with two balls in it. Are you sure that maybe he just, you know, wants to see a cock maybe? Now I just want to see a cock. Gotcha. Thank you for letting us know. He was hungry, he sees bread everywhere. Maybe that is the quote. If you're a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. What does that mean? I said I don't think it exists. There have been advancements that AI has helped with, where it's, um, with your measure, the cost of matrix multiplications in only multiplication operations and like, ignore the cost of additions, then there were improvements. But if you actually have to pay for additions, then there weren't. Something like that. I don't know. I just know that the algorithms showcased there were absolutely not viable for my N64. It feels like I made his whole face too small. That's kind of what he looks like. CinemaWave, yeah, it scales with the dimension of the matrix. If you could have AI do something for you, what would it be? Like, anything? I would have it tremble back in time to 2005 and invest my money into Bitcoin. Hello Biobuy, I'm working on the overworld. Maybe I should show you real quick the advancements I've made in Dino Domain. Oh wait, I could have just gotten that from the old overworld. Duh. Something not that dumb, but something that could happen eventually. I have to think about how to maximize money gain from this. That's my answer. So, we got the Yoshi God. He is now just yapping behind this gate here. I like this part here especially. It's gonna blast you with music. We got this whole thing. I have never used AI for textures. However, Chad has tried to convince me to use AI for textures. And everything they've posted looked absolutely horrendous. We've even done this on stream just to make fun of them. If you want to be made fun of, ask me to try to use AI for textures. Do we have a ball breaking scene in there yet? No. Zena's working on the animation right now. Even better, AI 3D models. Yeah, someone's trying to show their AI model of this guy right now. Actually, that's not terrible. That is a lot better than I expected. Of course, it is way too high poly. But it kind of looks like Pachyderm, doesn't it? I like what it did with the smooth hat here. I should copy that. Yeah, but obviously way too high poly. Maybe I can fuse the eyeball to this now. Like so. I remember when AI can only produce enough tanks. But now it's various from equal to anything. Yeah, that is true. I don't actually have strong opinions on AI. I just think it's a cool tech. The problem is I need to be against AI or I will get lynched. How do I extrude this now? I changed the button. What's the click extrude thing? Ctrl minus right mouse button thing.  Extrude the cursor. Where is it? Ctrl minus RMB? What is Ctrl minus RMB? Ctrl right click. Oh, right mouse button. I was pressing left mouse button. That didn't turn out too pretty. I love you, Mario. Oh my god, that is his name. That's fucked up. Dude, how did this happen? What? What the fuck is this music? Pokemon Colosseum OST. I genuinely have no idea how that even happened. What? What the fuck? Bizarre. Is this a song request? Winds of Gunship? Oh, because I did that. Makes sense. I think this has consistently been a thing. The more we've automated things, the more it's put power into the hands of the people that own the tools of automation. So I get that it's dangerous. We have them. We have Nabi nuts. Yep, I'm listening to it. But thank you for letting me know. There's a risk I would miss it otherwise. You guys will all be rejoiced to hear that I have my lawnmower back. The missing my lawnmower arc is finally over. And he is now upgraded with new wheels. What happened with it? He was in repair. One of his circuit boards got fried somehow. And I have googly eyes ready that I'm gonna glue onto him. And then he's gonna be my pet. It's against the zoning at all. I mean, right now maybe, but there's nothing stopping it from changing, right? Imagine you have a truly powerful tool, you wouldn't be selling it anymore. Like if I had a tool that could automate 90% of jobs in the world, I wouldn't sell that  I would just automate everyone's job and then take all the money myself. Can we picture Googly-Eyed Lawnmower when it's done? Sure. The memorial of a peep. Sounds like you have a pretty clear idea of what it would be. Sounds like you know exactly what you want, and how you want it. He needs to be lower poly, he's so high poly. It's so spotty. So it's like Googly-Eyes, they have to be 50mm away from distance. I wish I had big ones, but I only have like 25mm or something like that. What are your plans after completing this ROM hack? I hope you can develop a Mario ROM hack that has the same Toy Story 2 and N64 game. The big house? A whole big house ROM hack? I think people have had enough of big house hacks. That Nathaniel Bandy competition ruined the concept of big house hacks. We're going insane about the new Mario Kart update. Wait, what did they change? Was it like a good update or a bad update? Is it tears of joy or tears of sorrow? Bad? Oh no, what did I do? They're so angry about it. I almost want to watch this live on stream. Nintendo destroyed Mario Kart World Online? I am reacting to a random update in a Nintendo game, but what just happened in Mario Kart World is actually baffling. It's genuinely crazy and I feel like I need to say something because I don't know if Nintendo watches me or really pays attention to Nintendo creators. This could potentially kill your online community in Mario Kart World. So if you don't know what happened, I'll get everyone caught up real quick. Basically, to start, the way Mario Kart World Online used to work was basically you would be able to select three different tracks as well as a random track. Now, most of the time, with the three tracks, it would be an intermission, which would mean you're not really playing the tracks properly. You are just playing in a straight line going from one place to the other for most of that duration. It's not very fun. It's just mostly straight. And yes, some people like it. That's fine. There's nothing wrong with that. But the majority of people did not like that. Whenever you played online, people were either picking random... I like the knock-on races the most. ...it was far away and it wasn't an intermission. Well, this wasn't a perfect system. At least there was still a fairly decent balance of playing intermission tracks as well as playing the traditional three-lap way. Nintendo just released an update where if you select random now, there is a pretty high chance. We don't know the exact percentage yet, but there is now a fairly good chance that random also selects intermissions. What? I know people hated that. Why not just make the online mode the knock-off races? That's clearly what the game seems to be designed around. Skip to the last 10% of your streaming. One, we can play traditional tracks. We can play the tracks traditionally with the three-lap way. The old school way, the old and lame way instead of the hip and cool way. We drive in a straight fucking line for three minutes. All right, I feel better. I am, uh... Can we get back to work? I have a marathon video coming out this Saturday. Anyway, I just had to get that off my chest. Nintendo, if you see this, for the love of God, please, please revert the decision. Or, I don't know, you know what? They're not going to change. Weird. So in America, well, it looks fun for children. I had decent fun with it. Mario Kart, well, it looks like it would be really fun, like, in the discovery sense. I think I enjoyed it almost more single player or, like, time trial than multiplayer. But honestly, I have to say, I played it, like, once. And I think it might be the best Mario Kart, just physics-wise. Sounds like they murdered a guy or something. Honestly, for Nathaniel Bandy, that might be worse than what they did here. The problem is that you don't get to do free lap races, I think. So, you know, once you discover enough of the little things, there's nothing. Even the beeswitches just aren't that fun. But what about, like, discovering micro-optimizations in how you do time trials? Do they not have, like, the knockout tracks online? That seemed like the most fun way to play the game. They do? And people don't play it like that? But I first think that other people play it like that, too. Uh... Yeah, honestly, if I was playing Mario Kart, I wouldn't care, because I would only be playing the knockout stuff anyway. Maybe this is Nintendo just being like, We don't like how competitive you guys are playing with our game. We wanted this to be fun for little children. And you guys are playing like sweats. I know they did that with Smash. We don't like that you're playing competitively in our game. That's insane. I mean, that's what they did for Melee, right? Super Smash Bros. Moldy! Like, that old man, he has a gun, but it's a game about CMD and children, and I'm having a game that doesn't have to be for the whole family. I'm not sure how much it's aimed at children. I believe companies recently generally pivoted away from targeting children, just because the children audience has shrunk so much. We no longer live in a world made for children.  Fortnite already did the island tilting? Yeah, Fortnite were the first. Yoshi's Island tilted worlds? What's that? I don't know. I don't know. This isn't focused on the kids' area, to be honest, even if it doesn't look like it. Not like it was the obvious. They pretend to advertise to children, but they really are targeting man-children. What do you think of my pecky derm? Children make terrible presentations? Children don't make the presentations most of the time, no, it's the parents doing it for them. Wait, I just realized I forgot his tusks. What is he for? He is pecky derm. He is the guy that will ask you for 10 coins to enter course 1, or you can just grunt about next to him, and then he will fall over. He's this guy here. That is not quite what I said. There is a bug that makes the unblurred technique usually only work on PAL N64s, but there is a workaround to that bug that makes it work on NTSC ones. Well, we need something, right? You think this is such a bad idea that we shouldn't be doing this, Biomech? He feels very Yoshi's Island to me. Without him, it doesn't really feel like Yoshi. This is the first thing in the game. But we need to somehow make the player collect coins, and we need to get the coins in order      and we need to somehow make them realize these are like shock coins. He is basically the first thing in Yoshi's Story. Think about it. What is Yoshi's Story 1-1? I remember being a tiny little baby playing this game for the first time and I didn't know how to get past him. Yeah, he is there. Right there in the first level. Yoshi's Story is on N64. So it should be free, honestly. I need to think about whether it should be free. Isn't it nicer to set the precedent that you have to unlock stuff? I don't know. Oh, I like him. There is an engineer to be catchy and teaching mechanics should be basically the first thing you do. Yeah, but this teaches you also the mechanic of the coin save. I am worried that people are going to go into the first level and try to catch the star. It is a little easier than catching the rabbit doll, right? This is the wrong level. Why am I here? Like this would be the first thing you see. Why is there a random fucking star? Oh, that's why. Interesting. It would just tell you no entry, pay 10 coins. Well, I am worried that the player will try to catch the star. I have to get the 100 coin star and then be disappointed. No, coins don't get you anything. No. It also means that players will immediately start exploring the overworld and they will find the gate here that blocks the next area and they will find the other gate here. I think that's a very cool thing that the player explores this and the first few hooks are set. I think I really, really want the player to collect 10 coins. I think it does a lot for the game. It makes them immediately engage with the overworld. They might even find that star and there's another level. Wow, there are secrets everywhere in this game. That's my hope. I immediately feel like a chore. Hmm. How can we measure this? That's the question that we should be asking. Where is it? Hmm. Okay, in that case I am fine with a different way to open it. Because I really want the player to explore the overworld right away. That is somewhat important to me. We can just use Pachyderm somewhere else. He's gonna have a lot of use cases. For like Hidden Level or something. Because I see a point of it being somewhat of a chore. That thought does make sense to me. I think my first idea was that there would be like a switch or something that opens the level. I suppose it's possible players would experience or explore the overworld before even entering the first level as well. We also have Yoshua and the orange Yoshi, you know the lazy Yoshi, we can do something with him. No, I don't have a character I can run. He doesn't speak. Or, ideally, he wouldn't speak. Joshua's sleeping in front of the entrance, and then what? He's blocking the way, and you have to talk to him to be able to enter? Nah, that's not really a blockade, that's just annoying. I wanted something to block this that forces the player to go to just one random location that's like, on the outer edge of the island. And that's the goal here, to get the player to just move somewhere once, you know? Then there. The orange one. Hey four. If I start to have a punch him, or jump over him and all I have is make you talk to him. Yeah, but I don't see the benefit of making the player talk to the orange Yoshi. If they make a loud noise and wake the Yoshi up. You can wake him up by like, you know, just jumping near him or stuff. What can you damn do? Is he just a highway bender asking you for coins? He is annoying guy that just has a stop sign and he won't let you pass until you knock him over. Hello, Kyle. Does this system still work? It does! Wow, we need to make graphics for this. Why is the bunny invisible? These are a bit scary. I can't translate it to German myself. Yeah, the whole orange star thing still works. Okay, interesting. That's cool. And now there's seven stars here? I don't know when it would show up in the world again. Do they show up in the stars tonight? If you have the mission active, then uhm... There's a Yoshi under the star, like, waving at you. I can show you again maybe. Oops. Let's see what happens again. He might not do it again because I already beat the mission. Okay, yeah. Vector wants to meet. They need to show up somehow, but I haven't thought about the graphics for that yet. Are you tired, Kyle? Anyway... If we don't want Peggy Durham blocking this, we need to yet find another way. Also, 242 triangles, I think we're fine. Right? Right? No one can be upset at 242 triangles. Dude, what was the button? Okay, I just confused myself. 140! A fat white bird with pants? No. He wouldn't fit as well. He's not known to be blocking stuff like that. You're right that Yoshi's Island is more popular, but the characters are less fitting. Hmm. You know, it's very enjoyable and chill to hang out with purely based on vibes. You hang out with weird people. Peggy Durham, if you were hanging out with him, he would, like, contradict everything you say. Just for the love of it. He is a professional rage baiter. No, Peggy Durham is just an asshole. That's my interpretation of him. You're supposed to hate them. Anyway, so, if we don't want Peggy Durham to open that level, which, fair enough honestly, we need a different way to do it. This could be blocked by thorns and you have to remove the thorns somehow. How do you do that? I don't know. Could be blocked by metal bars and you remove the metal bars somehow. How do you do that? I do not know. How do you do that? I don't know. That is level 1, yes. And yes, I would like the player to experience the hub a little bit before they get in there. Just so they have locations in mind to explore for later. You know, always edge the player with something. Make sure they get edged before they can get to the first level. All the levels have different unlock methods. Okay, so the TNT would be here. And then the cord would maybe go over here. Okay. Well, I guess the cord would actually just go over there and up there. I think that would be the better way to do it. I don't think we need to force the player to talk to the Yoshi. Talking to the Yoshi should be optional. He's just gonna be sleeping here, I think. Okay. Does it make any sense for TNT to exist here, though? Let's think about it. Why would there be a TNT here? TNT doesn't feel very Mario-like, you know? Okay. We're still making the area moldy. It's very interesting to see the basic lore of the game. Ah, you kinda see it all in the intro cutscene anyway. It doesn't even say much. No, we don't have to do that. This is not a story-heavy game. I kinda don't like TNT for the reason of it just being not very Mario-ish. It's not very cartoonish. We need a Bob-omb. I guess a Bob-omb would do it, but is there a Bob-omb on Yoshi's Island? Man, this is tough.  Wouldn't that still feel like a catch quest anyway? Eh, I guess not quite.  Well, it makes sense because Bob-ombs take like 5 minutes to go through. Cool. Well, let's say we have... oops. Well, let's say we have a bunch of rocks in front of here. And then a Bob-omb up there. There's no way you would just be able to walk the Bob-omb all the way over. Check this out, Super Sadio. Oh, you made the animation for the sad guy? Let's see. Oops. Hehe, poor guy. Yep, that works. Hmm. I like how much level your levels have versus your add-in. Why Yoshi House in the hill area? The house being faded in the sand. We'll see how long it will take to make it in the game.  It can be a video, as I know. Once I have it finished programming. Speaking of Shy Guys though, maybe Shy Guys wouldn't be so bad in the overworld. The boat crash... How does the boat crash work? Hmm. Ooh. Hmm. What if it's just a big boulder you roll out of the way somehow? Like there could literally just be a giant boulder here and you push it to the side. Or you stand on top of the boulder and you roll it like an egg. Hmm. I guess we could actually use Bowser. Or Rock, or whatever. Drop the water nexus on the island. Use Bowser unless he's on the other island so you can see it first. Hmm. Oh, so you would be instantly explained the swimming mechanics. Hmm. Kinda like the boat crash, because imagine a big Nappina just eats the boat with Mario on it. In the intro cutscene. So you're on the boat. You swim over. There's the whole cutscene of the boat. The boat just getting fucking obliterated. Let's see, how would it work? Maybe, maybe it's like a stormy night. Nap-E-Nuts are just... I have a cool idea. Wait, I need to write this down real quick. Instead of pelvis, we have Nap-E-Nuts. Okay, this island just got a lot more dangerous. We're gonna surround the island with Nap-E-Nuts. And... I like this idea about a bag. So my idea is, we have the intro cutscene of Mario going here. It's gonna be a scene of like... Maybe... A stormy night or something. Or maybe not a stormy night, just like you come up here. And then the second you come here, a Nap-E-Nut just fucking munches your boat and Mario jumps off. And lands in the water here. With the Nap-E-Nut behind you. And then you just swim. I think that works. So we'll probably reach this part first.  Yeah! But we start Mario over here then, the first time you boot. Like so. ♪♪♪ Alright. Wait, no, this is gonna be where the thwomp is gonna end up being. Let's have Joshi sneak here maybe? Damn. Do we have an overworld to-do thing here? ♪♪♪ Intro cutscene? Or is he him, um... From afar and swimming towards the island? So, okay, let's think about the intro. Um, so... Machines get abducted. Swarm us, Mario and Mario's house. Leave the house to the harbour. We interact with the thwomps. Um, what about... Post-thought cutscene? Mario arrives at Yoshi's Island. He immediately gets mauled by a Nap-E-Nut. Start in the bottom corner. Where the thwomp would be. Mario then swims in the island while learning swimming controls. Learning to see Yoshi in the background. I think we'll do something like that. And then we should also just delete this boat here from the overworld. I think we can work with that. Will Marty the Thwomp be in the game? Um, maybe? What is the premise of Mario being in the area? Did Peach make him a king again? No, the Yoshis got abducted and Mario's supposed to help them. What does Mario know? He gets a letter. See all the Yoshis get caught in a trap except for the lazy Yoshi. Because he's too lazy to go for the trap. So that's why when you arrive the only Yoshi that's on the island is the lazy Yoshi. Wait, there was one I liked. What is going on? Hello. What? Huh? This is a render bug. I guess we have to switch to Eevee. That is the current intro, but I don't know if you keep it. Yeah, that's the idea, Jam0. We're not doing this to teach the controls. We're doing this to make the player see the whole island. All right, while back. That sounds promising. And just to clarify, I was thinking not a Stormy Night. I was thinking Mario just gets mauled by the Niapinons because I don't want the Stormy Night really. I think that's weird if it's like Stormy Night and then scene cuts. Okay, happy-go-lucky island. Is everyone ready for my bad opinion of the day? I think in the tortoise and the hare, the hare is like a million times more arrogant than the hare. The tortoise is the arrogant one. Because think about like what was going on in the tortoise's head. Like a fucking hare chases you to a race and you're a tortoise, a slow piece of shit. And your first thought is, yes, I can beat this guy. Let me accept the race. For what? You're delusional. What is going on? I don't understand what's going on. For some reason, this is just black when it really shouldn't be. I'm making a new material. This one fucks. Something's wrong with it. But the tortoise wins. I suppose the story proves them right. But at the same time, to think you could win in that situation is crazy. Is it not? I think we can all agree that playing the lottery is stupid. Doesn't mean that as soon as you win the lottery, suddenly you're a genius for having played the lottery. He says I can win and then wins. You gotta respect him. I mean, he definitely gains a lot of aura from that. But also. You so bald. Haha, thank you. Did you see that photoshop someone did of me where I'm bald? Is that why you're saying that? Some cases, slow and steady pace is better than fast and rushed one. Like working on a game. But maybe a turtle and hard race is not the best way to illustrate it for kids. Is it the best way? Look at Pokemon highest grossing franchise in the world. I think I'm not sure. And they've never gone slow and steady. That's photoshop. You think so? Who is this photoshop? You're just teasing me because you have nothing better to do. I don't know where I could find the picture of me being bald to show you guys. It is kind of a funny picture. I think I'll keep it here for now. But it is definitely intended to be here in the end. If you go with the plan, we just outlined. Also the NetEna idea is so much cooler than the Bubba idea. True. The point is that the Torus only agrees to race because he's betting that the hair is so arrogant, he'll take a nap during the race. So, then what's the lesson? Doesn't that kind of diminish the lesson? Slow and steady wins the race. If you know that your opponent is an arrogant loser, so it doesn't matter how slow you go. Yeah, sure. I work at Fortnite. I'm the guy that put Naruto next to Darth Vader. And then made him pick up the fucking family guy, Peter Copter. I programmed the Peter Copter in Fortnite. It's sad to go to LA, do not lose. True. Then your opponent can get you far. Lesson, always bet on your opponent to be stupid. Roll would not pass an Out of War exam. They have a lesson specifically about this. The torpedo tent to St. Marvin's Vessel. And you can showcase both of them right now from the first game. Now, it's just going to be a let be not. The island's dangerous, you know. Smart 6 members also respond with a very special Fortnite cosmetic incoming. They would do that. Wait, have they not revealed the Peter Copter in Fortnite yet? Did I just break NDA? Shit. Well, I guess the news is out that yet. We are adding the Peter Copter to Fortnite. It's gonna be the best weapon in the game. If you want those chicken Royales, you have to pick up the Peter Copter, man. Peter Copter is already out, of course. Why did I even think it wasn't in there yet? Of course, it's there. Can't believe I was just making up the stupidest shit I could think of and it was already in the game. What is this? Oh, the missing link video is done. Shoutouts to Kyle for that. Oh, yeah, I removed the stupid sign from the. The thing. You know what? I want to run around, of course, too, and show what else I've done on that. And then you guys can yell at me for doing it wrong or something. Please don't watch the video early. Just mute this for a second. We got the inside. Well, okay, awesome. I guess I'm not showing shit. Oh, no, we forgot to do the underground caves. Oops, I guess we'll have to do it when we get there. We got that temple door above. Great. That's what the fruit temple has a star net. Collect a star and the door opens itself. Oh, this is supposed to be a. Read the letter through. Yeah, there's a bug with the music in that level and that's why it crashes like that. Oh no, Blender has gotten slow again because we're in Eevee. I'm surprised I don't have a grades folder. Huh, thought I did. I'm switching back to Fast64 Redrun. Of fucking course it's just gonna go wrong again instantly. Why is it doing that, man? I think there's some sort of bug with the Fast64 Redrun that means I can't add any more materials. That sucks. We need to be on Eevee now, even though it's slow as hell. I don't think this is gonna make any mayhem, sadly.  Kinda nice. And then here we want a gate. We can just use one of the Yoshi gates from course 2 actually. And put that there. I think that would look good. And set up the X symbol, we'll just have a single star on it. Oh, ooooh, I see how this works. It's all one texture, that's kinda cool. And another one at that, okay. I'll just leave it be then, like this. So I don't have to make the star. Actually no, I kinda need the star right now. I'm just gonna make a very poor man's edit of this texture real quick. Where's the thing? Hello? Open the texture! What the fuck was that? It can open this one here. Now it can open this. Is there like a clone stamp in GIMP? There is. How do you use it? Scale button, shift S. Not what I wanted. Not what I want. Nope. Ah, I can scroll this. It's kind of nice. Multiply is kinda what I want. But it doesn't look too great. Why does this affect everything? What is going on? There we go. Okay, this is nice. Dang. Right. It is very stretched. That was bound to happen. Unswitching, unswitching. Can't do that. What if it required two stars? Actually, it requiring two stars is not terrible. But I'll just leave it like this. I don't want to do anything silly here. Okay. That's going to look hard. Okay. This is what it was supposed to be like. Okay. All looks good. Man, finally getting to program the overworld feels crazy. After all this time.  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That should show up correctly in-game now and be solid. And then we need to invent a system for save flags. A lot of stuff in the overworld will need save flags. We might need to make new space for save flags in the EEP room. We're going to have so many different ones. Okay. That felt really fucked up camera-wise. All right. Well, it looks great. Just needs a culling area. Okay. Okay. Okay. We definitely can't use these.  Shop flags. Shop flags is a terrible name. Oh, I see why. Castle Run Secret Stars. That's actually terrible. I don't like that at all. Oh, no. How many stars do we have in the overworld now? 17. So these 16 bits are no good. Fuck. We need to change this. That should be fine. Okay. Comeback flags. Event flags. I think we'll do it that way. That should just be fine because we don't really have the main menu filler data. Let me just see if the game still boots. Okay, I have lost all my stars, which was to be expected. We also have a playtime by keeping track of. We should do something with that. Oh, correct, the enter should be playing here. That is fine. I'm a bit worried about Mips not showing up here. Okay, good, the game still saves. Hello, Smudge. I'm feeling pretty done for today. We can continue this tomorrow. So we can program all the star unlock flags here to do stuff like dino the main door. Make it open up when you have one star and then make it stay open. So I will see you guys next stream, probably on Saturday, maybe on Friday. I'm not sure yet.
