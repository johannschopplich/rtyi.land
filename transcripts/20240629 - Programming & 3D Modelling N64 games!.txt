Sorry, I just got done doing a heavy set of squats. I'm a little bit out of breath Hello Lilaa free TV You You're losing my mind over fast 64, what about you Sounds about right. Yeah, I Spent some time this week Refactoring some of the RTUI code base. I Got it working on n64 again Fixed a lot of crashes. The game is a lot more stable. Now. I'm pretty happy with it. I Also replaced the first overworld with a new debug overworld And I fixed this part We have to drink the cum shake today Cuz someone redeemed it I'm thinking of doing it in 30 minutes so no one has to miss it How long will that last well until I refactor my code base and fuck it up again No one did no someone did Someone redeemed the cum shake Am I crazy, of course they did Nope Are you lying to me or You weren't there I sounded insane what you're gaslighting me Someone that yeah, you're gaslighting me I'm gonna clip. Hold on Wait, let me investigate this I Can somehow see what people redeemed right where is this in the creator dashboard? Manage stream maybe Yeah, I can see it right here you redeemed cum shake Hello Sarah, I am NOT mr. Obama Am I on the wrong YouTube stream again? I Am oh my god. I'm so sorry YouTube viewers. I don't end up alive. Hello divas. Hello whims. Hello tea time super marathon. Hello, Michi Michi I looked at your functions yesterday. I integrated some of them. It's pretty good It's a man, but it's clearly says in the list here that they redeemed cum shake Or is there a way they could have done this differently No You don't see it Oh, no, dude Well, I don't see it here either but they clearly redeemed it it says that on my thing Right like here Am I what Hello dude, dude, they're saying you didn't actually redeem it. I don't know why I'm check time. I'm planning to do that in 25 minutes So people have time to join before Zaina is gonna make one And Okay, let me tell you about this new system. I mean it that is gonna be very helpful in making this game So instead of oh god. Oh Something broke What Why did modes of the pipes break I Did that was a non box Anyway, okay. So the new system allows us to just render hot elements anytime we want Which okay. This is a bad example because I entered this on the wrong act but basically that means We save a few precious microseconds in every level we gain like probably like two microseconds globally from that new system I I Did not see how there's now the the hot thing here before that I had to like hard-code it But now I can just use my delegate system New microseconds. Yep Okay today our mission is to work on the freezy once again, let me check where we left off You Do you think Mario's thought no See him finished to know and she blinked up twice as much as I can Yes, he's doing that And then come on blow me All right, that looks good to me And we also can't touch him. I Think he's done. I think we can move on to the next thing Local Mario streaming is blown us through any OST wishes for today When you keep the old one, it's kind of important for the feeling make a sonic rum Higgs Bayonetta, alright, let's listen to the bayonet  Shake animation we could but Wait, it's searching backwards I Asked castle on a mountain top Thanks team and spare big snowman enemies that rolled ahead at you and Yoshi's Island Ravens, which one should we do first the Ravens or the enemies that rolled ahead of you? And she said infinite bacon, but no games or games infinite games, but no games Yeah, the latter Do you even someone has the same very spare room and see you and make a question about it and just close it because I Decided in a different method true Ravens are instead of Ravens Let's see Zeina you sent me the model, right Bone boys Bandit one Scat fam, where is the Ravens? I'm gonna go poorly. I don't think you've sent me the Ravens in a yeah, of course. I need the model Send it to me and I'll work on it So I think the Raven behavior will be very simple Probably what we're gonna do is we're gonna have them Just walk forward and then like walk on the geometry and like turn around and stuff Click to see attachment. Oh, it's just a file. I sent you no changes All right You Here he is It's the top not animated You There's gonna go seems like it's eyes are close to an overall theme or is to some mock-up. Nope, it's gonna be the ice level Now that's nice You already have infinite games but no games I know that feeling There's infinite games but none I want to play 95 units that's a little shorter than Mario What size of imagining these guys to be You Most of them are pretty small, right? Where's the model with normal ones, it's all the boss out there. Yes It'd be Maru's chest height, I think they need to be a bit bigger than It's a travel the Raven no, it's just a Raven And just make sure the animation still fun You Yep seems good Make the boss rifles return Raffle the Raven is gonna be a boss in this course But this is just a Raven so you will have the Ravens return Hello diamond It's just a unique twist to the eyes I was just an ice level, of course, there's a unique twist It's gonna be kind of like a surreal ice palace With some mindfuck stuff going on Hello Skyloft You Why didn't I say three times I'm not sure maybe something's wrong with you You Let me import him first and then we'll get the hitbox size and stuff You Like to spread them up ever more enhancing so that's neat you could write wasn't puzzle elements from it Ah, I don't think puzzle elements really fit because this is like a pure platformer puzzle stuff kind of seems against the basic design of this game You At least that's my take on it Oh, yeah, there's one more optimization idea that I got stretch, right And that is putting the frame buffers into separate memory segments I'm gonna try that sometime soon. And I think it could be a pretty good boost Probably like another two to three percent which you know, that's like a full FPS You He's I'm not gonna chase you around the planet. I guess maybe I'm not sure yet We have a few ideas for the boss fight. It's definitely gonna be some moon and cosmic elements to it Is this banger nope All right Fun dude, nice I like it   Hmm We need them for the the atmosphere and the vibe, but we can't just have them do nonsense We could have them walk back and forth like from here to here to here turn around go here and here I Didn't give him at this yet I Said some kind of ice dungeon, correct I Was right with Ralph you could use the poster was fine for me to head and I'm on his back Yeah That could work. I haven't really thought about it yet That's gonna be for another day right now. We're just doing the little guys here A question that's how am I gonna program this? Well, so tired so EP We could make him walk here and then slowly just turn smoothly You No, uh-huh Huh, I was going to eat Eric Hello cocaine now Congrats on your first message. I'm thinking of making a video about matrices next Can I haven't had time to record it yet, but it would be about how you can use random matrices to like get cool visuals What do you think It's gonna be like a secret course 11 preview The moment in a long time slide and spin around I could also just make it so that if they are ever above air, they just automatically turn 90 degrees. They'd have to completely ignore Mario. I guess that would be fine. And then if they ever don't hit anything with their raycast, they just turn 90 degrees. That would work. They could just walk and then raycast forwards, or like 45 degrees. And if they don't hit anything, they just rotate. And if they don't hit anything, they rotate forwards. If they hit a wall, they rotate like backwards. I think that would work. Who's that wait? It's just someone who knows you're a roach, Leela. It's honestly not even a secret at this point. The problem we have is, we still need to define the point at which they turn around, and we need an animation for them to turn around. We could provide them with a start rotation. This is gonna be a complicated enemy to program. Let's try this. So the start rotation was 90 degrees, so let's write C0. And then I'm expecting this to take like 100 frames before they turn around. Let's try that. I don't need to provide a start rotation, because they already have a rotation. We need a turn animation, maybe? I'm not sure yet. Pumpshake in 8 minutes, guys. See ya, Droid Seeker. Have fun camping. And so, 2 turn, 2 turn, 2 turn, 2 turn, 2 turn. So we're just gonna keep increasing the opacity. So some action 1 means turn around. We might need bitflexup actions. Actually, that doesn't work, because we have to turn around. Shit. Actually, let's decelerate first. We decelerate and then... We're just gonna do this. And then in this action here, it goes, goes, goes, slows down, turns around. I think that will look fine. Reset the timer. Actually, why am I not just using no action here? That would be easier. Yeah, fuck it, we're actually switching to the action system. Shit. Of course, this will not work. So we have very slow and sluggish turn animation. I'm not making a goat at SM64 on Android. Hello, Dishwater. I hope you're having fun using Arch. Oh, angle jar go crazy? True. What the hell is going on here? Oh, wrong symbol. We need to back up this thing somewhere. I'm not using animstates. That's a terrible idea. I can use health. Fuck this. Oh, we also have a problem here. The move angle jar doesn't actually... The jar might be zero. You know what I mean? I guess pitch is applied first. This should be fine. Hello, Power Master Alex. Go to F3DX 2.5. You think that's what I'm using? I kind of am using that, yeah. It's more like F3DX 2.05, but yeah. There's an acceleration phase I didn't think about. Actually, that's fine. We can just have the acceleration here. And use B.3 here. Second, someone wrote me. It's almost cum shake time. Zeina, are you ready? I have made a promise to this stream. We're going to mix quark and milk. And it's the most disgusting thing ever. But it's very healthy. Uh-oh. I hope Dude is still here so he gets his points worth. Okay, so now we should have a guy that just walks forward and turns. No animation yet. Let me just make sure that's actually what we're getting. It should work for about 5 seconds. Zero velocity is not what we want. Well, he's kind of a slow guy. Let's give him 18 velocity. I get it a lot, but how long until OST comes out? I don't know. I'm currently working on the 13th level. But I still need to do boza levels and two side levels. And a huge part of the overworld. And of course, after that, it's bug testing and beta testing and stuff. Yes, half quark, half milk. Wait, he doesn't have any textures. The fuck? Where is textures? What did Lena do? Is the machine insolent? Oh. The hell? I see the intention. Hello, Biobak. You're just in time for the cum shake. Oh, this is an i8, but it could just be an i8. Hell yeah. You enjoying my suffering? Dude, crying cats are so fucking funny. I can hear her move upstairs. She is accepted. Interesting. Who saw her move? Set face chart to move chart. Wait, did Zeina model him flipped? No, this is the right way around. The hell? Oh, bloat maxing. Why prim and shade? What would you use? How is he going to make this work? Okay, no shadow yet. That's fine. We don't need the angle tomorrow. Shade, but you just want him to be the cut off the lighting. So you would just be white. I don't want him to be white. He doesn't have a hitbox yet. I'm just trying to get this running first. Let's give them a dilly dally time too. Just because Zeina made the animation. It smells so bad. I don't know. This should be better. He's dilly-dallying for quite a bit, isn't he? Oh, I made the turn around way too slow. I see. This is the Bayonetta OST. Okay, there's some cute parts to this. Hello? This is just an enemy Biobak, but he's also going to be a boss. Don't ever make me do this again. A big time mistake. Are you guys seeing this? This is so disgusting. It's bad. How does it taste? Very creamy. It smells. I'm going back upstairs. Bye-bye. I can't suck the whole thing. Who redeemed it? Dude, this actually just looks like mayonnaise or something. This is way too much protein. It's very healthy. It just tastes extremely sour. My man's drinking straight unburned fetus. It's too white for mayo. It's whiter than mayo. Can you pull a Chris-Chan with it? No. It's okay, I'll show you what it is. It's like this stuff here. Plain, no sugar. This is like pure protein and some milk. And it's extremely sour. Honestly, it's not that bad. I wouldn't recommend it. This is purely milk product. It's not bitter, it's just sour. Seems I'm really enjoying it. It's not that bad. Well, let's finish the cumshake. Blech, there's chunks in it. You know what, it's good for you. Do they feel like going through the floor? They indeed are. Okay, fine, I'll fix this animation real quick. Whoops. So I'm just going to add a plane here. Oh, this new blender version, whenever you turn snap off while you're in move mode, it turns it back on once you leave the move mode. That's what's going on here. Oh, that's nice. The way he's bumping here. 168k channel points, get used to the taste. Oh, we got to change the goal to something else. He's so angry. But I'm just going to do this and scale the animation with his forward velocity. So I'm going to make him as an enemy different from the boss, apart from size. The boss is going to have different ways of beating him, right? The small one, you'll just be able to jump on him. The boss will have special attacks and you'll have to do something to knock him back. It's not like SM64 bosses. Do I have a 0 forward somewhere? I don't think so. Oh, the boss is probably also going to be black so we can make the cutscene work with the moon. Oh yeah, the way we had the boss fight planned is going to go crazy. Oh, I need this. He's so derpy he is. When do these streams start? 2 p.m. So 45 minutes ago and it's once a week. Did you miss Gamcheck? Yep. He missed the whole thing. Looks very good to me. The question is, where can we put them without it looking weird? Because, I mean, yeah. A bit too fast? Well, there's a variable to just configure that. That's super easy to fix. It's not even a programming issue at that point. Looks like the first animation is too slow. Could be, yeah. I can just change this to like a 5. No, 3. And it's kind of vertical level but downward? It's kind of like a mace-like level, I would say. Maybe he's a mace-caper so we can do a comparison. Right, so we got different paths through the castle here. And depending on where you want to go, you're going to have to go through different obstacles. Right now I'm kind of looking for places to even put this guy. Because we do need him for the theme. But he's such an inconsequential enemy that it's difficult to put him anywhere. I have not played Brood Attack now. I typically don't like Brood Attacks very much. They feel very samey to me. They're all like platformy, which I guess it's fine if you like that. But to me, games is about experiencing new ideas and concepts. And I don't really get that from this axe. The level does not have visuals yet. This is all just debug. Now I made an enemy before I even thought about where to put him. I could just make him walk on the walls here. The reflections are very nice. I'm not 100% satisfied with them yet though. Okay, let's try to put one here maybe. And then we can make him go from here to here. Like over the corner here. Okay, the spikes are still on Mario. Leave smoke trails. Can you just use the coal modder and summon a scientist to make Mario wake up without smoking? Yeah, I can. I just haven't. It is that simple. You can make them out of ice like they're minions. And you can make them pop out of anywhere and it will look cool. Shit, you're right. Just like ice minions popping out. But what do they do then? Do they just pop out, walk a path and then disappear? Oh, that would be so much easier to program. Dang, you have some convincing arguments, Biobak. You mean like pop out of ground, walk forwards, around the corner and then just disappear back in? Yeah, that would be so much easier. All right, I'm not doing that. It's cooler and easier to program. Um... 4, 2, 1 Interesting world and a motivation experiment. But yeah, I'm just missing the interesting world. I'm just not very interested in those. You know, that's the issue for me, I think. Hmm... I don't even need the dilly-dally time then. Just pop out, walk and then turn. I guess we can do like another one. Like so. And then they are very versatile. I don't even think they're very much based on Mario 64. It's just nothing interesting really going on, in my opinion. Hmm... It's just a general thing that I feel about Blurred Attacks. They are only there if you like the platforming and don't really want the adventure. It will be kind of similar to the Scatterbox Bono, yeah. All right, but then they need to be made out of ice. How do we make these look like they're made out of ice? Maybe the same material as the freezies? Not this one. Doesn't look too good. That definitely makes them look like they're made out of ice. Oops. Oh... Hmm... The little hair should be a branch. Yeah, this might just have to be like a triangular. Just like a snowy triangle basically. Yeah, I was thinking of a different color for this too. Like really dark red. Branch like a snowman. Maybe snowman ice too. Wait... Oh... Well, but he's not made out of snow, right? He's made out of ice. Or are you thinking he should be made out of snow? Yeah, Zayna, we decided that that's kind of like a cooler one. It's a different way of doing it and it's much easier to program. So I'm just doing that. Unless you want him to be made out of snow instead of ice. But do we? I don't know. I think this looks kind of cooler. Yeah. The beak and the feet should be more green. Green ice. Or are you just thinking they should generally just be different colors? Because with that I can kind of agree. Let me try some things here. Okay. Just a general idea of different colors I think works. Oh... This has potential. Let me just pick a brighter color for the main body. Okay. Okay. Where in the fuck am I? Oh, here. Hey! And then on the top we just kind of put like a triangle in there. Or a pyramid. Will the boss be an actual raven or just different ice? It will be an actual raven. Okay. Snow lay on the top. There's a problem with that. And that is that he's going to turn around. Do be what bro is looking like. You That looks cool. I don't want the snowman bridge because he's not made out of snow. He's out of ice. Do the Ryoshikens give you a spark? I'm thinking if you connect all of them you get a star, yes. He looks so cool. Dude, so many of the old levels we have are fucked now. Oh yeah, guys, I need your opinion on something. I don't think I got an opinion this last time. So I talked to Dan Salvato and he said that the dive jump we have is kind of like against the design of Mario 64 and I can kind of see it. The thing is, this lets you change your angle in midair and nothing else in Mario 64 does. In Mario 64, you jump, you're kind of committed. That's it. You are set. Plus, there's also the thing of, it's kind of a difficult maneuver to pull off. So a bad player is not going to be able to like, oh shit, I missed my jump, let me just fix it like that, right? It's the same way we would do with kicks. A bad player is probably just going to be like, oh fuck, now I died. You know what I mean? And I think he kind of has a point. So what I was thinking of doing was to limit the use of the dive a little bit more. It would be like a thing that you can use for like a minor advantage, just like a really experienced player and not something that is as powerful as it is right now. So what I was thinking is, you just get a small velocity boost and no, no, no, you just get a small angle change. Like if I hold for left, Mario doesn't change the angle at all. If I hold like slightly to the side, Mario changes slightly. And the further you hold from the direction, like the less it changes. What's your most favorite cumshake? True. I just didn't get many answers, so I want to present it again. I need more thoughts on this, you know? You can change the angle of it, but you get more air drift. Well, I mean, that's kind of what the kick does, right? Well, yeah, that's kind of what you can do with it. Might make some areas more difficult without it. Well, you still have like this move here. That's like the I'm a noob and I need saving move. And this move is a lot easier to use as a noob because you get so much time to react. To everything. Dude, I never thought this level would work. All the culling is wrong and the red coins are not going to work. But dude, the level kind of works. It's crazy. I want to know if the puddle works because I made some changes to the puddle. And I realized I really needed to verify that this works. That's a long death. Nope, I don't know an ETA. It's going to be a bit. St. Mario six foot anymore? True. Mario has never been six foot. All right, well. I meant 64. What? I'm not on the DNA. And. I don't need an option to. I can't use the beeper MCR. Let me just put on with them. So. It's amazing the way to jump back works in 64. Yes. Wait, actually. I guess it is very similar. Yeah. Except you can kind of change the angle and you can kind of like just lose your velocity. Maybe two to three years more or so. That sounds about right. Hello, elite. Wait, elite. I know you. You've been gone for so long. Don't you know? I feel like you knew that I was working on. Yoshi's Island. There's no way you didn't know. The shape is too thin. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. What's that? The one zero made or the one that storm and he made. I don't remember. Old man brain fails again. If you've been here like every stream and I just painted you like you've been gone for years. Oh, yeah, this is a good theme. Is that that's the money one? Nice shots. Yeah, this is this kind of sounds like milk with no cereal. You know what I mean? A cereal with no milk. I mean, it's a great song. Just it's not fake. The comments on this case, Emmanuel is such a great game designer and music designer. I love this work. Well, actually, I guess I'm kind of music designer because I gave them directions. I'm a director. I'm music director. Yeah. Hello, mother father. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So this will be part. And then we have turned to as well. Be part of two. Hello, Arthur. Please do not call me. Thanks. This is very offensive to me. Very stable genius. Thank you. I think I prefer to compose my own. That makes a difference. Case right is willing. That's you. Ben and guys do it. That guy. Diamond is called me. I wrote earlier. I feel like that's either the cat guy or that's that's the man himself. Hello. She's just seconds. Thank you very much. Thank you. Seems well to me. The crazy thing is from. But that doesn't like 2008 using some weird messed up tool chain. If you want to see. This is called wrinkly 64 from Donkey Kong Country 3. I don't know.  I don't know.  It's in B3 3. 1 2. That's crazy. You actually like B3 3. 1 3. I never played B3 3. 1 3. But it seems to at least have like a concept to it, you know, which is something you can't see about a lot of X. It has like a vibe and a feeling to it. But I don't think it's necessarily done well. Yeah. Okay. I see what you mean by effect. I got to do it like this, which is fucked up. So we can spawn him in walls basically. There needs to be like a pitch to normal thing. You know what? That's what we're going to do. It's angles to vector. He talks exactly the same. And to go to make a game that has so many levels and areas, it takes people years to find them all. And even then, they're not sure that would be really cool. But the problem is for that to be interesting, you need to have the Mario 64 thing like going on already. Right. Otherwise, no one's going to care. Well, it'd be 3, 3, 1, 3 major scope wouldn't really take that long. You can probably make like two levels a day realistically. How many levels do you need? Is this like 450 stars? We have seven stars per level. You get to make two a day, 32 days of work. I'm going to get shit on for saying that. Oh, my God. I will get you got murdered. And that's the way to find angles to normal. You're right. Like how you do it. Yeah, I just work on it like once a week at most. Fix the back. Oops. Oh, my God. I have no idea. I don't really think about it very much. I think it's done when it's done. So we got to put them like 160 units in the grounds. Like, you know, it's 160. What the fuck? There we go. Is your video going out? It says that right in the announcement. You should check the announcement. When you're decombining. S-Castle and Sea Ranger is doing a stale chili beans move and make a whole fixed code. What? I'm not decompiling anything We need to move 160 coordinates it needs to not look stupid. Can we just do it linear? I don't think so I think we have to decelerate We have to do 160 over the course of like 10 frames or so Average velocity 16 How do I compute this the fuck my brain's frozen What time I multiply by 4 help me We want 160 and what if we do like 10 frames that's 55 units multiplied by 4 it's like 2 Is that 55 it is it's 220 we do it by 3 it's 165 Okay Did I do this right I think I did Today my brain's not draining. I'm just very very tired Hello beta, it is raining where you live. Oh no Now what As you thought I would have liked to know I Guess to declare it first I Didn't know that's how it works in the compiler. That's crazy All right, we got this and now we need to place it somewhere So instead of placing Ravens directly we'll place the Raven spawners Oh Yeah, it was so flooded last year I've not programmed that parents yet But they should be able to just walk forward and then disappear If you get close to them So be prime freeze how long they exist We got that and then can I Want him to be like sideways So and I need to do that with just the pitch and the jaw. How am I supposed to do that? Wait Wait, that's a completely different axis. Do I have to do a matrix thing? Fuck You're kidding me, right I Okay, everything needs angles to normal, why don't we just do this There's a kid when I have those are empties I Didn't actually think you'd care. Don't worry. I know I Didn't think that you thought I cared. Don't worry I Guess I don't know what to tell you at this point. I only know that you're part of my weeks with your streams That's cool. I Did not export Wait, I did export where are my Ravens? The buzzy buzzy I Did not use way that content in my head. Oh, I saw the Raven for a second Some weird stuff is going on I guess seeing that What is my mistake First of all, let me reduce this just so there's more spawning real quick and the room I'll make sure shit matrix shit should not be required Oh I Made him go further into the ground Not come out of the ground That's why I have to room with a Yoshi cannon I know I'm gonna grab it ten of these pop out of the ground and charge at you That does sound pretty cool Hey You How they just flat this is so weird I Have no idea why he was flat he really shouldn't be Doesn't this Yeah, and gets the current scale We're coming to be perms too so shouldn't be disappearing instantly That's the one thing that I thought might be happening here Let's remove this just to make sure he doesn't instantly disappear Are you talking what can you do? I am the number one Mario sunshine eater Yeah Yeah, that wasn't it let's just return here see if there's even anything in this code that's doing this You Some of these have a wrong rotation what the fuck That is so concerning You The flat problem is not solved once it is off now and the rotation problem hopefully to There we go Now they just appear which is also not good Because we cannot try to move them backwards It should be zero but one of the two Yeah, so this should be purely on the y-axis It This is the wrong way around isn't it You Okay, now they're spawning in the ground I think it's good You Hello Jerry, thank that has been really long we got married over two years ago You Now what is going on Oh Wait, this is this is a vector pointing up, but we want the vector pointing forward Wait, this is also a vector pointing. No, this is a vector pointing forward We know this is a vector pointing Yeah, that's not what we want. We want an up vector You Just Subtract 0x4 0 0 0 and then I think this was right You Dang working with angles and normals at the same time sucks Yeah, let's just thinking about it wrong because I wanted to the up vector and got the followed vector or something I Was my camera rotation influencing this the camera is like the last thing that should be changing this Oh God I Will exclude as many arrow sources as possible to begin with I Subtracting 4-0-0 the right move here. Let's put the movement like 50 And return instantly here You Now how is my camera rotation inflincing the same? Actually, it might be that the fact that there's no animation That might be on the camera rotation influences this Roll around one of your levels for a moment. No, I don't wanna I'm programming What if I set it to minus 15 today no spawn in the ground Well, actually the test we did just now is invalid because he didn't have an animation meaning his translation rotation and That's it values. We're gonna be set to random corrupted memory Okay, minus 50 does set them into the ground Why do I have to add these I'll probably because it's supposed to be this Okay, I think now they spawn in the ground again, which is exactly what we want Don't have time to sit down and watch your streams I think I was able to follow with your videos Something's really looking at early game get that another crazy. I'll probably answer gonna be sure right rule The n64 is so much stronger than people give it credit for I Guess rotation is right. That's good. Good. Good. Very very good Let's Enable this and see if he comes out of the wall of his own volition Yep, I'm using lighten The other ones are for the other levels stick figures That's how I visit all my levels for a quick oh they're doing it now There we go Doesn't work anymore. Hello Yoshi Party. Am I winning? Sure. Winning hard. Is it the move function at the end? That's the problem. Multiplying is intentional. Now they should appear again but not move.  Somehow moving them like this does not work. Oh, I forgot the plus. Why did no one tell me? I moved all of them to the level origin. That was the issue the whole time. I forgot the plus. God, I really am tired today. Do you know the proper working moon jump code to work for World's End Rising Circus? Oh yeah, moon jump is very easy. You just go into system, cheats. Okay, I don't know how to add a cheat but you need to add D033FA100208133B1BC4220. No problem. Enjoy it. Is he forgot the plus? You're telling me now? I am not autistic man who can add the moon jump cheat code from memory. I just have a good memory, okay? You want to know the cheat code to mute all the sounds?  This one is pretty useful. See, people are like oh, I can memorize 15 digits of Pi. Bro, that's useless. What if you want to mute the sound effects in Mario 64? That's useful. How? Just do it. It is that simple. Love the meme Pannenkoek made about this. Wait, what? Pannenkoek made a meme about this? It's honestly not as impressive as it looks. Because all you really need to do to memorize the cheat code is you need to know what the assembly function is and you need to know the hex representation for assembly code and then you can just assembly program. In hexadecimal. This does not make you sound more sane. Do you guys remember that stream clip from like 2017 where I was talking to Melon and Melon's like, look at that memory address. That looks like it's it. And I was like, no, if I set this to this I'm going to move my memory.     Mario 256 coordinates in the air. And he's like, I don't believe you. And then I change it. And Mario floats 256 units in the air. And he's like, what the fuck? That was so funny. I don't remember the address though. I think it was 803B220 or something like that. Okay, for some reason, he's moving way too slow. He really shouldn't be. Is this velocity so low or is it something else? Let's set this to a hundred and print the velocity. Okay. I've got most of my assembly knowledge. This is probably why I don't understand him. I've been playing around with assembly music for like 6 years now. Well, fortunately in assembly you don't need a lot of knowledge, right? It's just like 20 instructions you need to program most things. Zero! He has zero velocity. How? Ah! Okay. Visible confusion is correct. This doesn't make a difference, but I'm going for it like this anyway. Hmm. Oh! It's because he's turning instantly. It's because I already programmed the turns even though I didn't set the variables for it yet. I'm sorry, I still don't know, but I just can't write code anymore. Should I go back and do something? Yeah. See what I used to do when I was a child? I had all the assembly instructions or all the memory addresses printed out and have them pinned above my monitors so I could just take a look at them. This looks weird. Not a fan. They should be speeding up before that. Like so. And... The animation seems way too slow for how fast they work. So let's divide it by two. You can, person, but you also need to import the instruments then. 3-0-3-3-F-A-1-0. That's not a game share code. No game share code starts with a 3, I think. What's that? 8-1-3-3-B-1-C-4-2. No, you got something completely wrong. That's not what I said for MoonJump. MoonJump starts with D-0. You start with 3-0 here. Wait, I'll type it into Twitch chat. No, that's D-0-3-3-F-A-1-0-3-2-0 and then 8-1-3-3-B-1-C-4-2-2-0. 4-2-2-0 if you want, like, low velocity. If you want, like, a goofy amount of velocity, what you can do is you can do, like, D-1-D-C-4-3-4-8. Fuck it. Don't you get lost in all of these codes? There are so many classes. This is not classes. I'm using C. There are no classes. Okay, next issue. They sometimes just disappear. And I know why. It's because the action increments before the timer resets. Are you going to use Mario Party 1 to bring music from a ROM? Can I port the instruments to yours, too? Yeah, but porting it one-to-one is really difficult in Mario 64. I like the little hop they do. If they did, like, a hop and disappear, that would be nice. But, of course, I meant to make them disappear this way. Anyone else need the GameShark codes? I might just have it. B-3-B-1-3? It has D-Code and Burner? What? Yeah, a bunch of people wrote that up. The hat is just not finalized yet. I'm also not sure about this here. The numbers here are kind of ugly, I think. I feel like we should upgrade this somehow, but I don't know what to. This is the Mario Pinball hat, which is kind of already an upgrade to the Mario 64 hat. But I'm not 100% convinced on it. Infinite Money Hack IRL? Well, I guess you can just commit bank robbery, but do you want that? Let's disappear over 20 frames. Let's have this velocity approach 0 at the end. And we need this to be 160. So, again... Wait, can we just divide this by 4? That should work, right? 20 multiplied by 21... 110... That doesn't work. 110, maybe 1.5? How is it divided by 2 instead of 4? I don't understand. We need goofy numbers? Wait, what for? No, in C-Code it just says exactly what it does. C-Code is very simple. It's basically as close to just English as you can get. I mean, it says what it does, right? Convert angles to normals. And then there's two angles in a normal, so clearly it converts these two angles into a normal. And then it says add to the position, so clearly it's just adding to the position. No? This is pretty much as close to clean English as you can get. In fact, this is more understandable than clean English, because if you speak English, there's a lot of ambiguity in your language. I don't understand this, though. This should be 20 multiplied by 21, divided by 2, which is... Wait, that's 210! It was 0.75! I don't know. I'm thinking of making a bunch of demos of just Course 1, with slight tweaks to the physics, to find physics that people like the most. Hey, there we go. And then instead of that, I will use just the timer, because I want the lowest velocity to be at the peak. Hello, B-Turk. Interesting, I forgot to change that. But how should you know what OilRig does? OilRig is just a file that has all the code for the OilRig in it. It's like a folder. Yeah, I like this. Well, have you ever heard me speak English? When I speak English, I use a lot of numbers, too. So, honestly, for me, it's the same thing. Making this game is honestly like scaling 50 Everests. That pretty much encapsulates how I feel about making video games. Hello, MikeyC. What are we cooking here? We are making these little ice ravens. They're gonna come out of the ground, and they're gonna be part of the castle, and they're just walking forward and hitting you. Should they freeze you, or should they just damage you? I'm not sure on this one. Damage. Yeah, let's give him the right hitbox, first of all. What did I put for this? I don't know. 144, so 72 radius. Interact, damage. Graph parameters here. Make a sphere, figure out the max range we'll ever need. It's gonna be like 162. What's the second one again? I think the second is the shadow type. I want the round shadow. Let me just copy this from somewhere. These values seem good, honestly. Maybe the opacity of the shadow should be slightly lower than usual. I see it's so small and out of ice. Maybe you can't jump on them, like you have to punch them and they slide until they hit a wall where they shatter. Yes, that would be good, but I would have to program movement in the plane with some recasting. Actually, it's not that difficult. I know exactly what would need to be done. It should do like 2 damage. Thanks for watching! Even model you have to code for him, but how can you mention together? How can I multiply with the code? The engine kind of handles linking that I just tell it the behavior at the model I Guess I know how the engine does that but that's a bit more complicated So, okay now you can't bounce on them either though I think that's not good either. I think it should be interact bounce top And the text that is clear every frame Every game engine does this we just tell it the behavior in the code. I mean, that's kind of the point of a game engine You Now let's figure out this guy wait that guy works. Oh That's so cool we can make guys walk on the sides Okay Probably should have them walk be param free multiplied by four frames. It's too it's too small The ice material for actor seems a bit inconsistent it's almost the same but this one has slight different colors for the week to look good She really didn't really get it like Python, I don't know I never broken Python Thank you for the prime Davey Very appreciated I Want to the fact the legacy of the five gods I've been pondering this question the whole night till Rent area what's wrong? Then notification is three weeks late. Did you just now at the button? Bumping in them is kind of fun. I Think a Yoshi coin for bumping on them when they're on the wall would work pretty well. Yeah Didn't have a runner they do Wait, they don't have a shadow where's the shadow that I had the shadow to the Raven spawner No, wait, there's no shadow here. Despite me seven shadow. Oh No I Just have 3.0 of 1.6 1.6 The guy that shoots shots Oh God Still I want to figure out why there's no shadow I Really should be a shadow. Oh, I know why J-flag get fluoride Don't all got me Oh God, you know, you're right though He does indeed not have a render area, let's add that real quick You've forgotten the cube technique what kill technique All three nine They kept sure buddy Snowblock needs it, too Oh God what's a scale? His scale is 10. So we just divide this by 10 and then we're fine Oh 9-0 It's cuz he's not active I don't know hello Sile I I Haven't seen him in a long time either, but I imagine he's still alive even if he's not active I'm getting comboed Oh No shadow still It should do it I'm gonna tell you if you use those razors and segregation for the waltz. We do use them for decorations on waltz I Think it will do very well Yeah, I don't see a reason the shadow wouldn't show up that's not good I Mean just make sure other shadows still show up It's origin being below the ground shouldn't matter can because it Finds the or actually maybe it does matter Let's crank this up a little bit just to make sure he's gonna be floating above the floor The numbers only hired you to work for their companies Well, we assume you mean ready as fuck to work for Nintendo when you price that Nintendo's back by choosing your croissant. I Can't step the tenders back me and intend or not friends But I eat penguin meat under which conditions But I eat penguin meat under which conditions because like if you offered me a hundred million dollars to eat penguin meat I would probably say yes Like for sure Like sure, I don't like to eat penguin meat but like I'm willing to do it for a price Should have it so when you button mash for top than ice from the ice breath It causes the ice to shake and crack breaking faster. I like that idea Fine I'll do it I Know you should be getting free faster. What is else business? It's gorgeous, it's a temporary level we didn't even model it yet I Might try it out of curiosity. Yeah We want like some particle You This might be able to be leading to a very rare bug where nevermind it doesn't I'm wrong Now when I mash buttons Mario should be shaking a little bit It doesn't Let me just make sure this works I Was a cool enemy, by the way, I like him too Can I make a strategy for your egg channel because I really want to see you do some more acts I don't have a react channel But if there's something where I feel like people would like my input on I might do another reaction I just do it when it's like really specifically tailored to something that is related to me I Need to you and eight What is Z again, it's like one zero zero Okay, so in that case we can just right shift it It should work now Hello buzzer Chris What's the rare bug if you enter a warp while the guy attacks you and You press a button Mario would be offset for a bit But no, that's not a bug that would happen because the offset resets when you enter an area Yeah Oh We needed one more bracket I think because of operator precedence As we say title case reacts look it up. Yeah, but it's not the react channel I have I was just reacting To a video someone made about me, right? I Don't have a react channel  Okay, so now I can move around but this still doesn't work Hmm Yeah, I don't know why Moritz Oh This is why You You know what Let's do this that's gonna look a lot nicer Oh It says that's what he tricked me into agreeing to meet Ravens and sons club, they're not penguins to Ravens It works I Think there's a bit too much randomness to it It's talking music not Donkey Kong Country cool and calming music plus rainstorm What is that she's I really want to check that out You You can read me this homomorphic to eat in penguin me, okay fair you use the big word I agree with you now The ice is a station for the animation to look right either bow should move or only the eyes shut depending on how cartoon You want to be? Okay, fine, I'll move the ice to You That should do it Leave a statement or is your project already tomorrow 64. Yes. Hello Lars I Talking about me those ice guys here are called Ravens and Yoshi's Islands Oh God That looks stupid Don't worry about it Lawrence, it doesn't make much sense Sometimes I just get stuck in a weird state like that Like there I don't understand that That is weird Hell this must be what's going on I You're gonna be great that I don't know I won't you want to go that's a crazy message to just send to someone I Me out I got hit twice there I think I'm stuck forever because I'm always touching this guy I Don't know what to do Like if you want to vote right wing remember your elections are next Sunday, and there's a guy who generally believed and shared it Mr. G day rated with a viewer count of a 1489 that is more viewers than I have ever had in my life. Holy shit I Bonjour live from say Jenna Polly live from say oh shit. I heard I heard you cannot speak bad French to French people. They will kill you for that I am so sorry for speaking bad French Don't worry guys we have we have a Biobak here. He is our French moderator. He makes up for this And while if we have a 1,500 people watching I guess I can show you guys what I'm doing I'm working on a Mari 64 mod here called return to Yoshi's Island 64 It's gonna have like 180 stars and hopefully it's gonna be really good This is what it looks like and runs near 60 FPS on a real Nintendo 64 We're doing our best on it we did a lot for optimization We Don't judge I can't speak English. Oh, that's reassuring K star Barnock, I don't know what that means. I imagine that's just a slur for people that don't speak French. Well Yes, it can run on native hardware I would show you but I have a European plaque on my n64 and I'm in Canada right now so I can't boot it I Love hearing bad French actually we we And this is another level we're making we have 13 levels done so far well 12 levels and a bunch of side levels He has when I hear a bad joke about French people The worst timing for this you guys know what French people's favorite Nintendo console is it's the Nintendo Wii I Know our current mission is to make it so that these guys can turn I need to put them in a position where they ought to turn first So Let's put them here Rotated 180 degrees We want them to work for watch for a little bit and then do the first turn so we probably want this to be like to have and then 1-0 and 8-0 for You We did program all the mods and assembly until 2018-2019, but then the mars64 DECOM project came out and We no longer need to do this You Right, so this is why he turns we need to store the turn direction somewhere Correction I Difficult is is a Megan compared to the comp is and some The logical part of assembly is way harder like making working ASM code and figuring out how code works I Say writing codes like for four to eight times harder and figuring out how code works. It's like 20 to 30 times harder But and see it's like a lot more work to like set up your compiler and stuff You Wait We need to start the goal angle so we can compare to it So What we do in the stream is programming and making a romhack basically Let's see how this works out So You not only need to deal with hexadecimal there also another position in the bone of each part of it every time usually yeah So right now there should be one spawning here and then he turns eventually Ah, oh no That is not what we wanted to happen So So now he's about me need to turn the whole make famous into a proper seeming project Nice invisible wall. There isn't a wall Means it is doing what he's made to do I   The last city is a lot higher than I thought it would be Basically You probably need this Yeah, see here's everything you need and see is pretty easy anything possible is just bloat Actually, I don't know if that's true Why is he going so fast I Shouldn't be going this far. It's like the forward velocity is approaching B param for and B param for set to eat Maurice normal walk velocity is 32 There's no reason for him to be that fast Say hop knocker hop knocker I So the first turn happens way too late, and the second turn happens way too early. And the formula nothing goes wrong. How about we just print these? Figure out what's going on here. The man has redeemed. Ask a stupid question. A stupid question you may ask. 24! How's it 24? That's not the value I set it to. It's clearly set to 8. Am I going insane? How dense is air? Am I supposed to guess? Probably 50 grams per cubic meter. It was a guess, I don't know if that's true. How much is it? Getting deeper and wrong wrong. Heavy room 4. No, it looks right. 1.93 kilograms per square meter? What? Actually, that's not that heavy. I keep forgetting that the square meter is like really fucking big. I think I was looking at like a square decimeter in my mind. Your name is the perfect Mario 64 now. 1,225, wait, 1,225, okay, yeah, those are two very similar numbers. Well, of course, it depends on your altitude. I was just imagining we were talking about the floor. Well writing everything in assembler is impractical because so many things are not shiftable in assembler. Or I guess if you could write the code in a way that is shiftable, it wouldn't really anymore. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is a fast 64 bug. I need to do that and then it will work. This is an order of operations issue, I think. Yeah I think I got wrong values because when you export it like that, it just exports the value with like lines and left shifts. If it works now, then I'm blaming fast 64. Yeah, Lila, you need to add brackets to that. This is 100% exclusively Lila's fault. Please send her hate mail. She knows what she did. Okay. It works. Of course the values are slightly wrong, but it's very fixable. Oh, this is so cool. Definitely, you're getting roasted by the perfect Mario 64. Okay, well, we got them working now. We kind of need the level first before we can actually put them everywhere. And the level's not done yet. But now that they work like we're all good. Next on the agenda would be the next enemy, which is a snowman who can like roll his head up on you and then kind of like do the pokey thing where a new ball comes out of the floor. But then we'll have to wait until next week or maybe I'll work on this like during the weekend secret, but I will be seeing you guys next week or maybe early. I don't know. Maybe I'll do a bonus stream. Bye bye.
