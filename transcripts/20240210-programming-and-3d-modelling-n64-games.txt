Hello, Sully, hello, Chad, Chad's not even here. You are, Chad. You're saying hello to yourself Music finished the leaked N64 version of Dinosaur Planet Just play Star Fox Adventure. Star Fox Adventure fucking sucks. Who wants to finish the N64 version of it? Let's be real, man Star Fox Adventure is so ass. I tried to play it twice. It's it's just not good Hello NeoVim user still using NeoVim Hello CX links, we already got any OST wishes today It is for a it is, okay We're already in programming modes today, we are not messing around Case is the only stream I watch let's fucking go. Hello Xeraclom I am the only case you watch that is probably also true Honestly, these all look like for 50 point F to me Lilaa, I'm the only like I've never watched your stream Lilaa. I didn't even know you stream And I don't even know what you look like I've never watched you now that I think about it I Was making some progress off stream in the mall hideout here looks like this right now Yeah, it spawned the rock on the wrong side and it's not far enough out I'm gonna make them all right-handed We need an OST we need something to listen to Hmm Diddy Kong racing, let's do it So I'll show you what we have so far So at least the need animation and the rock obviously needs to be thrown at you I I'm only a little bit worried about the camera here and then this will be where the boss fight happens You are we're actually true then we are all works in progress Dude there's actually there's exactly one time in your entire life where you will look the best you ever have it's Downward on both sides. You will get ugly after this moment Especially you why are you hideous right now? You Will max out on your 20s, dude, I'm still improving I am I Think around 40 days into my cut right now. I lost around 15 pounds and Dude, I I'm starting to look fucking chiseled. I didn't know I look this good and now I do and I'm still have I founds to lose it's gonna go crazy And then once I eat carbs again and my muscles become full oh my god, it's gonna look crazy Hello captain mangoes Case maxing true I don't 6.5 kilograms. Yeah, that's about how much I lost 6.5 kilograms in 40 days is pretty standard. You're supposed to lose around 2 pounds every week At least it's my call So it's like what almost six weeks So 12 pounds, I guess I went a bit too fast But some of that is also water weights. I think we're fine You don't know freedom units, yeah pounds kind of suck but it is what everything's measured in here, so It is what it is. You just multiply by 2.2 Right So 6.8 and that's 13.6 plus 10 percent. So about 15 pounds. I have 15. Yeah 50 pounds I Landing time is this what he needs? Do you know what I hate about pictures every time you smile, I don't know I'll have to see it to book to know what You're doing wrong Do you smile like Maybe that's the issue When the picture says it's Lilaa I think I Have an issue called kinda needing braces. Oh, that's unlucky. Yeah, not much I can do about it. Just get braces That's true selfies are pretty inaccurate just because of angle and stuff because they're kind of projecting something three-dimensional into two dimensions It's not gonna look perfect I Also think I look a lot better in real life than in pictures it is what it is Mmm, you know what, I'm just gonna ask to GPT how to do this In C given a natural distance and the gravity of minus 4 compute the Y velocity needed to make it so that when an object travels at velocity V it Reaches Compute the one where at that point She didn't tend to be true I Am just not feeling like doing physics right now Look at this shit. Do you really want me to do this on stream? I Don't want to do this on stream You Trying trying to get braces To multiplied by the square root multiplied by the root of Delta y I Think this is a lie, but let's just try it I Mean obj doesn't exist. Oh Wait When I just get this one I Know to be less insecure. Oh that just comes with time. You just need to get older What is a plucking addict you're plucking like the hair You It's not frank far enough and it's not frank to what's Mario I Just actually the sound I think it is I Guess it would suck for you to just like shave every day Isn't there like a thing where you can just get a blaze out of the way? That seems pretty useful Wait, what the fuck? How can this be? How can we multiply by Delta y? when Delta y could be like Negative low likes me. Thank you for the donation. No I'm skipping this. Fuck this. We're not doing this If you have the money, oh I see Shit how do I skip this? Mmm Fuck fuck fuck. I need to skip this song. I Can't listen to this All that was a pop-up that was blocking it There we go, we're saved When you can get a game is another thing you could do from a legal standpoint fair I Would not listen again Syriac isn't that the guy that did like the weird to the animations? Where things would go crazy? That's so old, isn't it? Kitty city, okay. Let's just think about this Hmm We can't just compute the amount of frames actually we can compute the amount of frames It's Telling me to just take the absolute value here. This is just that there's no way this can work If Delta y is 0 we always do it no I Don't think just make up bullshit, I feel like that would work Mmm To pick another one So natural distance of a thousand and this is like 30 Okay, chachi PD is not being useful here, let's just make up bullshit until it works then I guess fuck it It's all blessed math, yeah, but it should be able to look up formulas, right? I'm sure there's a Google article on do how to do exactly what I'm trying to do here So I'm pretty sure that It should be able to find it Oh It's What's this so we have this many frames By this many frames we need to have moved Delta y coordinates There's two solutions for this obviously on the up and on the down We want the big one every single time Hmm Get ready go Yep, we're still on the cowboy level. I should be gotten worse in your opinion. No, I mean it's probably gotten worse. I'd like Asking things that The positions that be in power don't want you to ask but it's still good at math questions And we can compute the velocity as just initial well, okay, wait, let's do this Y equals initial Well Minus frames multiple before and we know Delta y equals some zero comma frames to Mario Well, why right Which is this The integral over this is I Guess the frames is our constant here. So that's Actually, we shouldn't do that we shouldn't do the integral we should actually just do the sum How do you how do you do the sum Maybe check if they can tell me that because I don't see it in something. What does this equal? Uh, definitely InitialVal by Mr. Mario minus, yeah, okay, it can't tell me that either. Well, I mean, obviously I asked the question very wrong. Um, this is module rehearsal plus one divided by two. That's the sum of all of these, and I guess I just multiply this by four. So this is what delta y equals, and we wanna get InitialVal out of this. So, delta y divided by InitialVal equals, shit, I can't just get InitialVal out of this. Because this is two terms. I can't move this into the bracket here, does that help? Wait, this is all an equation depending on InitialVal, if I do this right. Let me think about this. No, it's not, because we have the InitialVal here. How do you solve this? Solve this equation for InitialVal. Have you been to the General Secret Readable from the Original D-Comp? In some places arguably yes, but in most places I made it much worse. Apparently this is the solution to this, so let's see if that's true. Is it readable to the average person? The average person is like a 50-year-old woman living in... What's the most average location to live in? China? The average person is a 50-year-old woman living in China, so I would say that person is not able to read my code. Oh nice, this looks like a pretty decent solution. Oh, that was too short. He took it literally. Well, who the fuck... What is average person? Average programmer? If they try hard enough, then yes, they will be able to read it. It looks like it works fine until delta y is like... No, even there it looked mostly fine. Is there maybe a friction factor in this? Is the average person a woman? I think so. I think the world population is like 51% male. Honestly, I want to forget HHGreg in SM64. Sure, buddy. There has to be two solutions to this, right? So how did this come up with one solution? I think we found the wrong solution here. How is there only one solution? Did this fight the first or the second one? What's not working? It's not shooting the thing far enough if you are standing on something. See, we have to do it like this. We have to program these to always shoot at Mario. Hi, Harshi. Hi, Lilaa. Hi, everyone else. Yeah, it's like it's taking the wrong delta y. I feel like this is supposed to be a minus. Could this be a minus? No, it can't be. Oh, by the way, you guys want to see something cool? I made a completely new collision system. I said, fuck Mario 64's collision. It is unusable. We have our completely own collision system now. And it's so much more stable. We could even go into a shit thing like this and not get stuck. How fucking insane is that? Look at it. Hola, Fanda. Hola, Amanda. It does kind of sound like that. This is real shit. Like, look at this. It literally just works. Even fucked up spots like this. There's a BLJ spot in the tree level if you need it. There's a BLJ spot right here. BLJ is a bit different. It's a bit difficult to execute right now. It looks a little weird. Yeah, maybe ceilings still need a little bit of work. Did you finish the Minecraft mission? I did. I don't know when I finished it. Feels like Friday. No, like last week's Friday. As far as cardio needs, make the most accuracy what you want to roll. Oh, I know what the issue is. I had these flipped around. Hello, XBM. Hey. He's hitting me. Nice. We did the math. Yeah. That's not BS physics. It's real physics. We computed the proper sum of frame steps and then made it go towards Mario. Do you take Mario's velocity into account? No, it shoots exactly where Mario is at. It's not predictive. I don't want this to be predictive. I'm not trying to prevent the BLJ. It's more so that just by making more stable physics, it just so happened to remove BLJ. And I consider that a bad thing, actually. All right, now we should be taking damage from this thing. Ideally, BLJ would still be possible. And I'm sure there are spots where BLJ is possible. Why are they all shooting offset to the left? Okay. I guess. Will your life reverse when the egg is done? Yeah, I'll still make games. There actually was still a former fork that before, but now it's like all different. What happens when you walk on the bridge in the cowboy level? The bridge is still not finished, but we can try. Let's just see what happens. It is one of the more fucked geometries, so I can see where the question is coming from. Yeah, nothing special. I had to remove the collision here for RAM reasons for now. Oh yeah, you guys didn't even see this. There's molts here now. Just like crawling in the ground. They're underground, they're underground. They're in your vaults. What are they doing? Nice molts underground. That's a fucking sick case. Orange cowboy world, it's kind of orange. It's also kind of blue. It's like 50, actually, it's like 40% orange and like 35% blue. Lilaa is underground, Lilaa is under my house. Below my floor. Oh, I hope you're having a good time down there. Now, why won't they take any damage? And why are they still shooting offset? I feel like they should fix it. What's your opinion on bugs? Like it's cool that you're keeping in lots of bugs, but it doesn't also limit gravity. And the thing about BLJ is, you have to seek it out. It's not something that can happen on accident. So if there's a bug in Mario 64 that you only encounter if you do it on purpose, I'll leave it in the game. But if it can happen on accident, I'll remove it. Okay. I feel like this is being computed after the behavior runs. It is not. How can this be? Do the moles throw shit? No. They throw rocks. What's up? Thank you, Dalla Pizza. Do you guys know the pizza song? Okay, this is a funny question. If I say the pizza song, which song are you thinking about? Because I don't know what the song is called, but there is a pizza song. And we all know it. Even if you're not thinking about it right now, I guarantee you know the pizza song. Pizza Tower. Pizza Tower. It's a pizza song. I think it's this one. Wait. I want to find this. This one. That one. This one. No, that's the pizza song. You don't know the pizza song? Is it this one? Let's find this on YouTube and listen to it. No, that's not it. No, I can't find it. You don't know it? People who don't like Tears of the Kingdom? Damn, I'm in that group. What? That's so cool. But it needs to be for pizza. Okay, I think the rocks should do 2 damage. And then we can move on to the boss fight. Maybe it's because I used to watch German TV as a German kid. And that was always the song that was in the pizza restaurant music. Tarantella Napoletana. Is that it? No. No, no, no, no, no, not that. It's a pizza song for you. No, it's wrong. It's this one. How is it called? I don't know what it's called. Too bad. All right. Since this is a boss fight, we kind of want a door here that closes. Maybe it should just be like a wall of crystals. I don't know. For my money, I think the best Zelda game is Majora's Mask. I don't know.  Now that I'm at Majora's Mask. It's been a long time since. It's hard to think of a Zelda game that I think is a good Zelda game. That is not like a childhood game. Because with those childhood games, I kind of fear that I like them because of nostalgia reasons. So I don't want to be like, oh, this is a good game. Just because I played as a kid. I feel like that would be unfair towards other games. I feel like had I grown up on Twilight Princess instead of Ocarina of Time, I would like Twilight Princess a lot more than Ocarina of Time. But because I haven't, I didn't. Skyward Sword was one game I truly hated. It's good just not for the story. Maybe that makes sense, yeah. For me, Twilight Princess had the huge issue that, first of all, I didn't like the motion controls. They didn't really work for me. I think I was just in a room that was too cramped. So that kind of reduced my enjoyment of it. And then also, the boss fight, like the banished one or whatever the fuck his name was. Dude, that was just such a painful boss to fight over and over. I was talking about Skyward Sword, did I say Twilight Princess? Twilight Princess was fun. Nooooo, it's starting again. Man, I hate this game. Zayna isn't even home today. The fifth , reports fifth  5.5 five five five five 10 needs and asked because my floor is stinky wouldn't that mean your floor is stinky damn i called her floor stinky it's so jova for her might as well just pack him up how are you recovering from that one a 1.  545 five five five five five five five and and and and and action and i think about it this would be bad because it's missing the glow we need something else we need like metal parts i think that's what i'll do let's see hitler versus mega hitler i mean you should if you have the option between those two it is pretty clear that mega hitler is worse than just hitler right it's a pretty easy vote at that point like given those two options you should pick the lesser evil right well you don't have to vote right you can just not vote i don't know if this is true but that's giving a vote kind of legitimize the system like ever voting happened and only one percent of people weren't there would people accept the result i feel like they wouldn't matter I see I think this kind of works it just needs a different different texture Lilaa for president honestly I don't even doubt that I feel like if Lilaa was president she would be doing a better job than what we have right now although she still wouldn't finish quaternion animations which is fucked up Lilaa will only vote for you if you promise that you will force a few programmers to finish quaternion animations otherwise he will not get my vote putting taxpayer money into Mario 64 romeo king I'm fine with that she would send me to some labor camp maybe I shouldn't vote for her you make all the pranker youtube on unreal nice Lilaa will steal our penis okay maybe that's a bit too dark of a topic rachet codes maybe that's not a good topic to talk about on stream what do you think the game you're working on for my confidence got bootleg tart what does that mean I don't people like the game you're making I mean that's a good thing right I mean that's good news right what you need help with Lilaa is technically a teenager but like the 18 is like coming in hard how much longer do you have being a cat Lilaa like what nine months and then it's all over can decide if you want to be happy or cry you should cry you're getting old how much longer until you start balding like me I don't know people say high school is like the best period of a life but for me I feel like if you are in school you are simply not a free being like if you want freedom you need like a job and money and stuff and then you can be free and you just don't get that in school and I think that's why high school is not actually good in my opinion I didn't like it there I feel like only someone who doesn't value freedom could think that or who values maybe maybe you feel like yet more freedom in high school I guess that's also a thing that can happen we're like no I'm old and I have so many responsibilities and I feel like I have no more freedom I don't know maybe maybe some people's adult life just goes different opinion on skippity toilets I have looked at it and I don't get it that is my entire opinion on it's been a year less freedom than high school us so you just didn't value freedom much and that's why you liked high school because you valued the social aspects more than the freedom you have as an adult you see you guys are pretty free you can leave whenever you want that's true but the fun experience more I see I mean that works too I think the reason that high school is so good for most people is that it gives you a place where you frequently meet the same people over and over and you're forced to attend which gives you repeat exposure to people and it lets you build friendships whereas most of our adult life after that you don't really get that opportunity in a job you can't really be yourself as much because there's so much pressure to like act proper so maybe high school that's why people like high school because like the only time in life we can really make friends unless you join the club as an adult afterwards I could cause balding high testosterone values I think can cause balding shit did I did I do this right I did I need to export this and I need to add this to my level scripts yeah you probably are not gonna go bald very quickly you know I was just poking fun and you were getting older I however will go bald pretty soon hello exponent you hate high school them sorry I do not what you mean being bald is do you know how nice it feels to just have no hair on here dude it's the best if it wasn't for my wife banning me from going bald I would I've already shaved bald the heck it's invisible it's here but it's invisible cool 0x4 be Oh fast 64 buck I see if you added the levels good while exporting it will just wipe your changes I shaved bald for one summer because it was too warm and it feels so good that's actually something I don't understand how come like swimmers and runners don't go bald even but you're not a swimmer yeah but I'm talking about swimmers I know you're not an athlete and she's 14 you actually built like a roach no I don't like geometry dash I don't like rhythm games I value having freedom in games and the rhythm game is the opposite of that it's just an execution test so this one is where caps they wear caps to reduce the friction why not just go bald you'd have less weight to carry with you and maybe a little less friction imagine how water we will you have long pretty hair woman moment what the fuck is going on here does this say nothing special I'm just talking about being bald I had long hair as a guy and it was very cringe I'm glad I don't have anymore hello Ben doing pretty well making good progress on this okay we want a boss fight here with the Monty Moles here I'm a dude with long hair your name is paper kitty I thought you were a woman like this whole time hmm what's a good way to have this boss fight I was thinking that'd be five moles here and they'd come out and throw a rock at you and whenever you hit one there's like one less but the rest go faster I think that works I mean this is five years ago I'm so freaking mad guys I swear I like women I'm a man there's a song about this in German it's called I like women I swear and the whole song they talk about how much they like women and how they're not gay that's the vibe I'm getting right now I'm sorry I think this boss fight idea works. There's some things I'm not sure about here though, like, isn't it kind of lame that you fight five different ones? What if there's five all around you and there's going to be so many rocks that you can't see them? That's a bit boring. Yeah, I have a Discord server. You can join it through my description maybe? I think we may need a better idea for the boss fight. I kind of made this area before even thinking about it. Dramatrash is not a rhythm game, it's a platformer. Plays exactly like a rhythm game. It's even synced to music, right? The demographic for Plain Girl was like 60%... Dude, you know what that reminds me of? So my best friend and my uncle, one time they were talking and my uncle said to my best friend, what Kaze is doing, working out, I think that's really cool. But the pictures he posts, holy shit, that looks so gay. All right, we need creative ideas. They definitely look like a Wegermol type thing, but how do we make Wegermol fun and  Today is a brainstorming session, I think, starting here. Oh God, we're not going back to 2015 gay math memes. I do not like those. Unless you're actually being creative about it. Give Mario a huge ass hammer. I don't think about that one. It could be like a survival thing, we just have to survive waves of bullets, but that also feels a bit counterintuitive. This is the mole hideout where they have stolen all the money. We're still going to put a bit more money in here, like we're going to put money bags and barrels full of money and stuff. I mean, the creatures have two other ones after they pop out. That's a bit weird, because like collision wise, how does that work? How do you intuit what happens when you touch a Monty Mole while they're going into the next door? Also, how does that work as a fight? I definitely want them popping out and I feel like I want the player to be in the middle by default. I have already eaten over 17 bananas in my life. I never found out how many I have eaten. What's a realistic number? That's weird to think about. I probably ate less than a thousand bananas in my life. But also probably more than a hundred. Or maybe just around a hundred. Welcome back, Sonic the Hedgehog. What? Super Danny to the rescue on YouTube exposed you. Super Danny to the rescue on YouTube. Ten followers. This guy? I'm so exposed. That is Lina, I believe you. Maybe that's Lina from like five years ago. Why didn't I think about this before we made the whole mole area? We could obviously just end it with a star without a boss fight. Like that wouldn't be a big deal to just have the star here. Or to just have like a really simple boss fight. Mario does squish and stretch when he jumps. You see that? Woohoo! We can also just do nine moles here and you just bonk all of them and then you win. Like have this just be a simple fight without a real boss. Just put nine moles in here, bonk them all to win. I think that works just fine. The star could pop in. Oh, I see what you mean. I'm thinking of fake Monty mods. I feel like the star popping in and out idea is kind of something that might work. But I can't think of a good way to implement that. Like the idea is creative, which is why I'm considering it. But I just don't know if it's good. Like can we make the creative idea good somehow? One of them has a star. Still, that's like... Hmm, is that any different? What would that entail really? Yeah, the spin jump is not going to be repetitive if you play the game normally. See, when I receive a criticism, I try to figure out like what the person was feeling that's wrong, right? I don't really think about what they're saying as much as I think about what they were feeling and seeing if I can address their feeling instead of their actual critique. Because I usually think there's a little bit of a critic... How do you call it? The critic's dilemma is what I call it. Where the more someone criticizes something and looks at something, the more media you consume, the worse you get at criticizing it. Because you start identifying things that you think makes this piece of media good. And you're no longer just talking about the feelings the piece of media evokes. Now suddenly you are like evaluating a movie by, I don't know, some random parameters that you've set or a game with some random parameters that you've set that might not actually one-to-one match up with what actually makes a person feel a desirable emotion. And because of that, whenever I receive criticism, especially if it's from people that played a lot of games and maybe thought about how to criticize games, I just try to look at the underlying feeling. That being said, I think nine Monty Maltz is really the best thing we can do here. Or just five. But they switch holes. Let's do that. Far good. They need a beep harm, where if it's set to true, then they pick a random hole to come out of. Good answer, you can't stomp them, so you have to bomb the shit out of them. Oh, actually. Man. No, I don't like hard hats, because this is a cowboy level. But the idea of using a power-up is kind of fun. Case, why are you creepy or wet? Aren't all humans kind of wet? For Monty Maltz. I don't understand. Is there a boss here? Oh, no, we can't do that. No. This is a western level, we can't have a tank. I think we're just gonna go with the random hole idea. Nothing more western than a tank, true. Except false, actually. What is pneumonia? No boss is better. It will just be a few enemies you have to beat. I think it's actually good that you have to beat the enemies. Because getting past the enemies is very easy, because they just shoot at where you are. So they kind of serve as an introduction to the mechanic, before you actually play against the boss. Lungs issue? Oh, that sucks. No, they are tanks and giant mechanical spiders. Watch Dark and Wild Wild West. Okay, I will just choose to blindly believe you without watching the documentary. To get into the western mood, I was watching... What's it called? The Ballad of Buster Scruggly or whatever. And I was just half watching it while programming, and I don't understand it at all. What the fuck was going on in that movie? I couldn't even figure out who the characters are. I just stopped watching at some point, because I was like, okay, I don't get this. My mic is muted. Oh, that's unlucky, but I guess we have accidentally just been quiet for two hours. Do you know who Keizo is? Nope. They shattered your car to steal the 12 pack of Mountain Dew? America. Oh, it's a bunch of different shorts. That's probably why. That makes sense. I thought the point was like, oh, there's this big car. Cowboy, and then he gets shot, and then we follow the next person. Watching movies and programming? Yeah, I had like 50% attention. See, it's like an action movie or something, which I thought this was. I thought this was just like a movie you watch for the vibe. Kind of makes sense, but I guess that explains why I just couldn't do it. What's confusing to you, too? So I'm not the only one. What movie are you talking about? The Ballad of Buster Scruggly. Buster Scruggs. I don't know, Tom Waits-es. It's a very stylish movie, the beginning especially. Very, very cool and like JoJo-esque. Do I like Sonic? I like two Sonic games. Two and a half, and the rest is complete, utter, unplayable garbage. That sucks, Beta. You probably lost a lot of money from that. I don't know. You feel like Sonic games are boring? That's an interesting way to put it. I actually think the Xbox version of Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 is the easiest one to just have fun with. I have never played the PC version, though. But I like that one. It had many necessary bug fixes. Okay, now we need to make the molds come out of here. And then we're all good. Okay. Okay. Okay. A long and boring website has proof. Okay, I'm not reading that. I know that there are screenshots people don't like, but I mean, I don't really give a fuck about slight difference in lighting. Sure, maybe it looks a little worse, but eh. I don't really care. Why put void as parameter for the function if the function is already void? That's just a convention from what the Vanilla Decomp did. I don't know if there was a reason they did it like that, but I just kept doing it like that. I guess that's how they started. Do you think it's worth to learn assembly? Depends. What's your goal in life? Now we need to get a random object here. We can probably just do this. Okay. La la la la la. Uh oh. The la la la la stopped. Why is it so ominous? I almost wrote it. Do it fucking cringe I think using int is so cringe I also use go to so I don't sure buddy object node whatever you say not that this is the exact same thing if you want to learn assembly I think the easiest way to learn it is to play TIS 100 and I feel like that gives you most of the benefits of learning assembly too sign long longing you just write s64 right otherwise something's wrong with you this should work I feel like this will work I also feel like I missed something just not export the thing I might have just forgotten to export a level I hope not also the molds are not a solid size T why not just U or S typing like six characters that are not even describing whether that's signed or not that is cringe I got a shitty handheld device that can emulate like all the games and emulates them via retroarch it works surprisingly well it can do dreamcast games with like small leg to the people that gave me that wanted me to shit I don't know what that was the people that gave me that thing wanted me to make an advertisement about it afterwards and I I did and they were so mad at me I am very angry right this shouldn't do anything why were they mad wait let me see it was a great ad right people love that ad hello I'm very angry right now before doing this I made my needs very clear to you you're green your videos one minute I can see my product I don't think this is kind of a conversation I just ignored them it is what it is I think I gave them an awesome ad in before a lawsuit the company that's like bootleg devices with 2,000 Nintendo games burned on is gonna sue me yeah right you ever hear the word if you're sitting in the glass house don't throw with rocks yeah it's generally it like it's a really good product I actually like it I'm still playing with the plank every night right now I'm working on meeting forbidden memories and actually looks really good like the colors are nice it has like two sticks I like the thing but they were very upset at me let's just print text let's just see what this is finding and why this is going wrong we don't reset to home do we no we don't why they upset I don't know maybe it's because of how unconventional my ad was because in my video I said like yeah I thought this was a Chinese scam but this is actually good maybe they didn't like stuff like that because it is a Chinese scam like it's that's not full or so oh because I hit the Monty more I see beats this because it's more than four four digits they probably also thought I was gonna upload it to my main channel but I come on you're offering me $150 device to upload the thing to my main channel where usually for an ad you get like $3,000 yeah no way you thought you would get that three six okay so it is making numbers but not not actually acting on them I don't know who Steph Sterling is dude the funniest ad read ever was monkey Jones he he's a very edgy youtuber and he got us to do an ad thing and in the ad video he was just basically like talking about how he's racist and supports Hitler and then he did the ad and then he just got went back right to like the Hitler talk imagine that is like your ads like holy shit I don't like parallel launcher what's my name from main channel I did brilliant because I thought brilliant was like a decent sponsor and they let me do it at the end of the video for a thousand three hundred video and when rate offered they offered me around like three thousand five hundred dollars but that was a while ago so I think like for a post video ads like if I get something a thousand thousand five hundred I would do it and for pre video it needs to be like a lot like five thousand and it needs to be a sponsor that doesn't fucking suck big bucks well it would be big bucks if I ever actually got a deal like that and usually don't yes there's gold everywhere yeah I wish brilliant would sponsor me again there's a lot of videos I made only because I was sponsored by brilliant and they ended up getting way too many views how is this not actually editing the position like surely this would be editing the position it is generating this and we are setting the action to zero and then the action zero are only resetting the pulse by so what could be the issue let's stare at the Sun don't we know it's not working anyone see a stupid mistake I made somewhere maybe wait I know the stupid mistake I made okay the first five should be here and then the next one should be somewhere else nice it's working oh no there's two at the same time that was supposed to not be possible what the hell they all stuck us I know why they're stuck and then after this we just need to make it so that if you jump on them they die we'll just have them be dizzy and go in and then they will disappear they'll be like shaking the hats and like spinny eyes and stuff like that oh that looks nice now I think we've got it oh they also need to be intangible should add some kind of sparkling effects on the big diamond and that could look good yeah although I'm not sure how maybe some subtle effect I have a little bit of a glow effect on it with just a decal the band is messing up nope we don't want to listen to this any new OST ideas I don't want to listen to the band is messing up please what why is Marth in here what what is going hey is that your new OST that's a funny idea it's gonna be intense stream if single coin gets spawned and we need the multi-mode death sound as well when he's accusing of like wasting it being true I can't speak true you know what one coin I think one coin is fair not two you know what two coins fits but actually one coins one or two can't decide how's it going so far good good we are making the progress let's look at what sounds multi-mode normally uses we want to add more of those to the game Oh Monty Mole up here of course Monty Mole attack we have that one dying enemy one Let's see it, obj spawn loot coins doesn't exist it's a static function why would this be static? I need a decentralized server, nope I don't have any should use the monokai vs code theme why? I like this one what's the advantage? and then we gotta make it so that if no nearby monty moles are found we have to just... wait what the fuck was that? oh okay I see a few issues they are truly in pain and maybe not the triangles also this doesn't spawn any coins let's try that and this is too big a size what the hell okay that one just won't die the shrink sound is here that's maybe a few too many of these and maybe shrinking too fast the coins, why won't the coins spawn? that is the y-velocity so what's wrong with 30? everything else uses 20 so it shouldn't matter oh I see we need to set the amount of coins we can spawn first this is a safety precaution because of respawning actors that the sm64 devs put in there we go of course if the n64's memory bandwidth wasn't a factor we could easily have games run like maybe five times as fast well maybe not easily sm64 probably still would have sucked but it would have been a lot better performance-wise of course Mario 64 is a great game I know what the issue is it's because I walked into it the entire status needs to reset after every time or it can no longer interact game dev as a job or just as a hobby it's both I kind of have two jobs and one of them is like game dev through hacking the other is game dev in Unreal Engine 5 it's true I work for the company behind ahead of time and all my opinions are official opinions by the company no I'm kidding I'm kidding don't take it serious do you know when people have like their workplace linked in their bio and are like opinions on here are not in my company's they're mine it's just a disclaimer case Kansas shop Kansas it's actually crazy one bad tweet of me and the whole thing would be in scrutiny you know that it kind of happens every time a big company works with an influencer for some reason the influencers always do some dumb shit how difficult is it just not I mean memory bandwidth is still an issue in like modern computers out of Milo so I don't know I don't know how much of it was really just a mistake or how much of it was analyzing the cost and like you know because memory bandwidth is something you can't easily like a hundred times optimize just by having better algorithms but CPU code is so maybe that's why it feels like the CPU is so much better than it needs to be compared to the memory because if you look at a vanilla mar 64 the CPU there is used a lot the CPU there is often the bottleneck it's just that if you program well the CPU is no longer the bottleneck exactly as much you think about making your own platform again yeah I'm gonna I'm planning like alongside the release of return to your silent I'll probably launch like a Kickstarter for my own game and then transition to working on that and then hopefully I can hire some other rom hackers to work on it with me actually far good let's get the player coins for the last one what's that got to do with making your own game it's true for everything hey this is star number two okay I needed to know that what do you mean like a platform I console that you add your language to know a platformer as in like a 3d platformer a game where you do the bing bing wahoo that's what platformer means shit I gotta figure out the right position here let me just take this divide this by two divide this by two move it up 200 name this a bunch of sevenths export take the coordinate put them in yeah if I was making a PC platformer I would probably have like late n64 early Gamecube graphics and I would just write decent code and I would probably just run it like 400 frames a second what did they exactly improve on the game compared to the n64 I'm not sure honestly I wouldn't know I just know it's a lot faster in every aspect what oh because of the 777 and it's basically more powerful in every way dude what wait is our run do a GDC talk that would be so sick it GDC talk with our run C++ is just the same as C I really don't notice the difference I think these are a little bit too slow as a boss I think the boss ones need to become now I use the mod on GCC C++ does have a bit of jank that's true I mean the levels are left to make after this three more main courses and two side levels and one bowser level we're like 80% of the way there to effectively make this faster I think I need the animations so let me just write some to do add animations once animations are in there should also be like a random value here something like 10 plus 8 and then this should be like maybe from 20 rating plus our opacity I think that should be better maybe this is a bit too low considering you have to dodge the bullets this can be zero actually let's do like 25 at 25 is like a lot variation 20 and this is 35 25 and so the C++ if you have a compiler for it and it probably should also appear in a bigger distance so that you can't take them out one by one like that I think that's the biggest thing right now also the sliding there sucks isn't object-oriented programming more like a mindset than the language you use that's how I looked at it I can write pretty object-oriented C I feel and I can write C++ that is absolutely not object-oriented right this most of this would just be a valid C++ program and it wouldn't just magically become object-oriented because they switch the language right that makes me realize that we need a minimum velocity for the rock throw okay max and initial well should do it okay I think I'm done for today we've made good the boss fights basically done I just gotta add some more decorations to the area and then star one and two are done and we need to move on to star three then which is gonna be fun cuz that's the Goomba imposter tower so we gotta that will be funny yeah I guess I'll see you guys in the next stream bye bye
