It's just the noise, it's too loud. The ringing is too loud. Hello. Hi. I'm going to refresh this so it won't work. Hello, hello. Hey, you're streaming. Yes, I know. Hello, Cliff Longat, hello, Extolmite. MrLateByOneMinuteEmmanuel, oh no. Uh oh. I was shitting, I'm sorry. Hi, Extolmite. Hello, Pepe. Hello, Cereal. Hi, Cereal. Banana bread, sure, buddy. Whatever you say. Banana bread is tasty. Doing good, how about me? Good, good. I've been making improvements to the game this week. Just like going back, fixing all the random stuff. God, what even is turn specific I did? Oh, I completely remade the 3D section in N-Curse 2. That's actually the short for tomorrow. Dude, it feels like an eternity since I did this. What the fuck? This was a busy week. How long have I been coding and modeling for? 12 years, maybe? God, what were we doing last week? God damn. We were building a castle. While we were building a big tower. Yes. Let me just close a bunch of these tabs. Any idea to eat today? An idea to eat? Why do you need an idea to eat? You can eat without an idea. Make yourself a nice tasty sandwich. Hello, Limington. Shit. Okay, so this is what we were working on. We're working on Bozo's tower here. And... They need to be like an entry here. And what else? Hi, Kate. When I grow up, I want to do things as awesome as what you are doing right now. Nice. I'm running level or something. Couldn't find anything in the description that could have helped. Yes, we are making course 11 right now. Hello, Xeroclom. Hi, Viva. Dude, I worked on so many random things this week. I basically just went over my to-do list from course 1 all the way up until recent. The best place to learn C programming? Literally, just start doing it. You don't need a place for it. Literally, just open a compiler and start it. Have a project you want to do and do it. But also... And no one's gonna agree with this. I think you should not learn C until you've learned assembly. Learning C before you've learned assembly is like explaining color to a blind person. Right? You need to get vision first before you can learn what color is. So start with assembly if you actually want a proper understanding of programming. Yeah, so we were working on a Tower of Arboza here. And we were working on making this all work. So we have our course 1 area here. Our star 1 area here. Then we have... The minion striking will be over here. And this will be... Do we still go with... Dude, what was our final verdict on the boss fight here? C++ is literally the exact same thing as C. I started programming C++ on the first day of my new job and I instantly just managed to do it. 70 is 10 times more difficult and abstract to get into. It's a lot more difficult. Yes. No doubt. But you need that to be able to understand C, I think. Okay, so... Oh, right. So this is where you move on top of here. Because the one worker is going to be out here. And then you do that. And you knock Bowser's head off and you get another star. Star 3 is going to be here. Guy eats you and one of the cleaning crew and spits you out in a separate area. Oh, okay, okay. So the strike is going to be here. And then a cutscene starts and the guy just comes by and eats you. So this would probably have to be like a grate instead of this bucket here. Okay, now I know where we left off. Good, good. Let's get back to it. Back to Bowser's Tower here. Can you write ASM in VS Code? I don't know. You just need like text editor. So why not? I never tried it, but I don't see a reason why not. Okay. Okay. What music shall we listen to today? Any wishes or anything? How about the Tears of the Kingdom OST? I thought we were going to get spoiled for stuff we haven't heard yet. True. Okay, what else are we listening to? We're not listening to the Pokémon Go song. Absolutely not. Out of the question. Star Road OST? No. Yes, there was a giant owl block that eats you. I do remember that. Just had to get a quick recall on what we did and what we didn't do here last time. No, we're not listening to Tears of the Kingdom. Hello, ArkDustTWD. Star Road OST is very nostalgic. Dude, can you imagine how much people would love Star Road nowadays if Skalox wasn't like Skalox, if he was literally any other person? Damn. But the question is, is Star Road still a good hack? Yeah, it's still good. Majora's Mask OST? Alright, fine. Actually, how about Twilight Princess OST? I like Twilight Princess. Hello, Benjamin. We're doing pretty well. At least I think so. I'm doing well. I don't know how she's doing. I'm doing pretty well. We rescued a little baby bird today. We did. Well, we rescued it yesterday. Well, we finished rescuing it today. Yeah. Well, I went to take out the compost and there was just this little bird just sitting in the parking lot and he wouldn't move. And then I picked him up and then he tried to fly away but couldn't get very far. He just kind of flew to the car that was by mine and then just struggled to fly. So I scooped him up and went into the backyard and then Kaze found a box. We gave him a little towel with some food and water. And now he was all better this morning. He was a lot more chipper than when we found him yesterday. Yeah, now he's fine. And it was kind of nice to see him all happy and ready to go. Yeah. Like there was one point we were trying to put him in the box and he just wouldn't perch off of my hand. Hello, Mario Luigi. Hello, Mario Luigi. CurseMirror speak too. I didn't want to say anything to Robot himself because he worked really hard on it. But I didn't have fun with CurseMirror. I didn't beat it yet. I got like 12 stars, but I was just getting bored of it and then I just kind of stopped. Maybe I'm just a grumpy old man, you know, so don't read too much into that. Old man hates video games. Yeah. You never played Aromag in your life and you're just chilling. Are you still planning on releasing in the game a split screen multiplayer mod? I'm thinking about it. Yes, I think so. I get a two week break from work at the end of next month. So I was thinking of just doing a bunch of large stream stairway. I'm making multiplayer in here. You played a demo. The demo is so different from the final game. Actually, it's insane. I mean, just like Chris. Chris 2 back then. Chris 8 now. Shit. It's going to be impossible to find it. It's yeah, it's a bit exhausting to get there. Let me just get there real quick. I want to show you guys some changes I made. 10 hacks in your entire life. That's like less than one hack per year that you've actually been in the Mario 64 hacking community. Oh yeah, we got new camera controls. Let me tell you about the new camera controls. We have C left and right to rotate the camera. We're back now. Holding to rotate is gone. But instead on the D-pad, you can hold to rotate slowly like this. We got C up and C down doing this. We got D-pad up and D-pad down doing this. And we got R to center the camera behind Mario. Hopefully this will feel a bit better to control. We were complaining because of the slow control on the C button that there was too much input lag. So your Chris 1. Deep Dives Through the Dorms has been reworked. Turtle Street has been reworked. Deep Sea Dive has been reworked. Bomb Cat's Secret has been reworked. 8-Round Treasures is mostly the same. And this one has been reworked just this week. So basically everything in this level has been completely reworked from the demo. It looks completely different. The framerate is higher. The level is better. Can we still see upslide in a sec? Let me see. No, you can't. Unfortunate. So this is the new retro section. This is still like the Mario Bros. 3 Underground. But instead of what it was before, we got more slides in here. The walls are wider so the camera doesn't get squished. And I think the slides are really cool because that's actually how the level worked in Mario Bros. 3. Because what made you set the breath meter to so short compared to vanilla? Or is it just different how it fits in the new format? I guess the reason I wanted it shorter than vanilla is because in this level you'd be able to just get everywhere. And I don't want that to happen. I don't want the player to just feel free to roam around everywhere until they are on a Koopa shell. So there are some Koopa shells you can grab here. If you're quick enough. Well, not like that. Yeah, leaving that pipe is a bit dangerous. But I'm sure you can live. Okay, I guess I can't find the Koopa shell right now. That's unlucky. I wasn't the biggest fan of Mario 74 when it came out either. But I think if you play it with a non-stop code it's pretty cool. I don't know if it's just me, but I think it's pretty cool.   There's some just fun running around with Mario in there and that's all the hack is about. It's just that if you don't have non-stop there's too much backtracking. Or not backtracking, but retreading the same ground. You played it on release? How fucking old are you? What? I didn't play it on release. It was already an old tech by the time I started ROM making. Oh, okay. You were 11? Wait, you're 23 now? Roughly? Plus minus a bit? It's not even that old. Hello, 77. Is that a hex number? What is 77 in hex? 77. God, I don't want to confidently do that. I could calculate it, but I would not be able to talk from it. It's probably like 2000. Originally having played Missing Stars on release? Yeah, you'd have to be really old. Hello, are you working on something else? I miss your everyday streaming. I am also very busy with my actual real job that pays my bills now. I have one. ROM making is not that lucrative, so I had to get a job other than that. And that is keeping me very busy. Very busy. Oh, shit. Was that super sad for everyone? Wow, you have a real job other than video games? Well, my real job is also video games. I'm a programmer at a video game company. Yeah, that makes sense that it was ultra sad. Hello, sheer headache. This looks kind of cool. I like it. You were late. Oh, that's unlucky. Sarah Klum, do you do 3D animation or do you just do like modeling for the game that you're making? Didn't even know he was until I watched the Black Mellow video. Who he was? Black Mellow? How do you find time at all for ROM making? I couldn't think of more overtime demanding job if I tried. Well, I mean, I don't mind working 70-hour weeks. I'm kind of just a little different. Yeah, Frobo made Missing Stars. Oh, this needs to be color-fucked. Everything in this is color-fucked, I forgot. The fog looks so good, though. Where's Frobo now, you wonder? We will never know. He has left his dark past of modding Mario behind. Of course, I still work out. I do have a bit of an injury right now, though. So my workout has been reduced like the last two months or so. So I'll start working overtime. They're working when they're in space. I guess it's not very demanding. Handling work though is it position for the airwheel there is a functionality built into the n64 of alpha threshold if you can set the threshold for like an alpha value so basically it's just a texture for the wheel and then a texture that's like a circular gradient and when the alpha is more than the threshold we render it and when it's less than we don't render it and we kind of just like multiply the alpha from both textures I'm pretty sure he's joking when he says only 14 years you were to wait Mario 64 is so much older than you crazy did it's actually insane Mario 64 is so much of my life that I do categorize people into being born before and after Mario 64 when I meet like 32-year-olds is like holy shit you're an actual conscious human being when Mario 64 was around that's crazy people are either just born before the event or after the event it's possible make moon gravity in s6 era because I think space level would be fun concept it's a super baby easy to do that the question is what a level with that mechanic be fun here's a fun fact gravity and video games is a lot higher than gravity in real world because falling with real-world gravity in a video game is super slow and sluggish so moon gravity in a video game is actually just real-world gravity let's try this texture actually that explains a few things oh fuck what I do oh there's a bird Zayna I don't think it's our bird is it nope that's not our wait your dad was 21 when your mom was 13 your mom was born in 1983 and you were 16 years old so in 2007 is when you were born so your mom was 24 and your dad was 32 it's kind of weird it looks like some other birds ate all the seeds on the patio holy shit he did math what is he a fucking wizard unbelievable when your mom joke honestly I wish I had one but your mom joking a twitch viewer just out of nowhere it's so rude hello xpm hello Luigifan let's actually take a look at our level breathe in the atmosphere get a vibe for it should make a mini rum hank where he makes apparent and will repeat what you say by using the answer microphone so this is completely useless hunk of junk I would still be completely useless as we real what the fuck something really wrong with the fuck here I don't think this is what it looks like in game so let's just test it being able to use the n64 microphone for stuff would be very cool I agree making a romic based on that would be really funny I wonder what you can do for that even why does the guy with the dry bones fetish never watch the streams maybe yes maybe he just doesn't have any dry bone stuff to say seems good to me I can concern kitten I can concern kitten all right dude that reminds me I don't know how much you guys know about anime but so when I was in as cousins recommend that I watched the anime called re0 because he thought I might find it interesting and holy shit the characters in it are so obnoxious I like the setting don't get me wrong but like what the fuck is going on with the characters they all act like they were written by like a fat 35 year old just reddit moderator who's like never touched a woman in his life and will never touch a woman in his life like you know the typical reddit mod you know what I mean it's like an absolutely chunky gamer you got the target I don't know the guy I don't think the guy ever interacted with women just the way it was written yeah it's a redditor protagonist yeah well it's not really directed a protagonist it's more like all the characters are written the way that a redditor would like want them to act it's like this weird fantasy fulfillment thing free powers and women and money for no real effort yeah exactly like in the show four days pass and suddenly just one of the girls is just completely in love with the main character and it makes no sense I figured out how to do it but how it's pretty complicated but it's very cheap to render actually so it's all good yeah it's a nice okay I don't mind that as a genre though I know I know a lot of people just hate that as a genre but I think that's like an amazing genre because that's the best way you can set up like an interesting world I find just like everything that actually uses the genre is just insufferable it's so sad too because the settings interesting and I want to know more about the setting and I want to see a cool world I'm gonna be like man how would I act in this world you know it's just like an interesting fantasy world to pull you in but then at the same time it's just the Maori movie he is an isekai yes I agree yeah exactly I'm not very relatable as a human and I don't find characters very relatable to me so usually when there's like a work of fiction I derive my joy from like the world and the setting and stuff like that so that's really what I'm looking out for keg honka honka hello that's the best name do you think what I said before would look good what did you say before Tronimation were you the robot pipe guy I hope not I'm saying would be terrible if all you care about is world-building I imagine you have already seen the last avatar the last airbender right yeah I think so yeah honestly it's still fun to revisit from time to time yes keg we are making good progress well currently we're struggling to find the right textures but after that we're gonna be back to making good progress I'm sure of it I want to do something like this year what's like the outlines are there I think maybe I could do that by like making stuff darker let's try that it spells as a building so it shouldn't be the other colors right it should be like darker colors you could just have like the entrance shaped like Bowser's mouth give it a bit more Bowser flair mmm I don't want to do that again that already is like a thing so many times I mean I guess if this is gonna be just a corporate office it should be kind of plain yeah we could have like a Bowser flag up on the top of the top of it just as a little decoration you can hide a Yoshi coin up there too mmm I mean both of likes are fine but we already have like a thing up there all right let's try this so probably says that this is watching his workflow makes me envious wish I worked with more people like him performance tester my workflow what's my workflow do for performance testers I mean I imagine working with these somewhat pleasant because I just remember everything and because I am so skilled by Xerox one have bikes are plum make yourself something tasty see ya I guess the biggest problem with working with me is that I do have a strong vision myself and I do like to argue it's just a room full of poses plushies or what did you say it's just a room full of plushies it'd be funny yeah I upgrade to Windows 11 absolutely fucking not do I want even more Windows spyware no thank you Windows 10 gives me exactly what I need Windows 11 looks like a virus well it's kind of like a thing that's happening with every Windows update there's just more spyware and nothing you actually need I mean I find it really funny that Windows 8 was so poorly received that they went to Windows 10 and had most of the default settings back yeah and they made the look exactly pretty similar to Windows 7 I would like that if just society as a whole move to Linux instead of Windows do not give Microsoft that power they don't know how to wield it unfortunately not everything is Linux compatible at least not yet it not yet dude what the fuck is going on with the fuck on this thing this is insane oh well they said that Windows 10 was gonna be the last Windows I guess they lied the problem with using Linux is that nothing fucking works on it and also the fact that you have to install and compile everything yourself that's just annoying dude they lied and this looks so good I kind of like this as well as office I feel like something's missing though like there should just be a thing there are you like a little poster or a billboard no I think something poking out I don't want to put a Bowser face on there but you know something like that Bowser statue the Bowser statue is already right here oh yeah maybe like a Koopa shell or his spike shell hmm this is like a little office decoration Hmm maybe and I look something a chicken egg problem well yeah it's people have to move to the new OS like together but obviously if you make the first move you're gonna be in shitville for a bit I think that would be really cool if Mario could smooth in addition in between I mentioned such as being idle and going to run it's not too hard to implement mmm yeah we can do that actually with Lila's new quaternion system as soon as it's there but I think I won't make it Mario's movement less snappy so I don't really want that it will be possible though no problem I mean you could have just his flag hanging down on the office window on the office building hmm like the one we have I mean windows aren't that bad an idea yeah what why did this disappear what the fuck oh interesting I see why windows with flags hanging out and this is weird this should work hello Don after that how was your week mostly good I made a random improvements to the game was the building was like a Yakuza building maybe you like oh well let's look at that let's see what kind of decorations they put on there does he have a big tower somewhere I feel like I remember a that definitely looks like a big tower can you see it from the distance though oh yeah oh that he has that on here I like that yeah but should we really turn this into like a neon building I feel like that doesn't fit the aesthetic that definitely should be a huge puzzle over on there I think that would fix my issues with this I mean do need a good buzzer logo though if you want to try and make one yeah let me just fix this buzzy beetle first yeah exactly neon lights don't fit likely we're just adding the thing here and just think of the shape so there will be a round logo here I think just a round logo hmm we have custom buzzer fights everywhere we already have two custom buzzer fights get a steampunk sign steampunk sign how's that look like I don't know what even is steampunk I'm not sure I ever understood that I mean why is this connected try to get rid of that god damn it something something analog computers remain super popular forever some sort of wooden sign to make it look like an old factory of some sort and this is his office building and this is like boses oil rig here so it's not supposed to look that old I messed this up there we go I've also been told about a new microcode today that we might want to use the microcode allows you to disable near clipping so that would solve some of our camera issues and you don't like the banjo games but eventually there are all these state-of-the-art industries there's good material for inspiration too I am aware of those and I do kind of like know how they look like it's because a lot of the time when I make my hacks or when I used to make my hacks I worked with UED who really really loves banjo a lot of the time we even like put banjo stuff into the petroleum I think that's a good place for the logo to be and we just put it on here it should work Bowser's brush want to make some brush what did I miss Russian we're getting some more theories today what I could do with the odyssey source code I don't know don't even run them on odyssey the biggest thing stopping me from modding odyssey is not not having a source code it's the fact that I just want to mod it do not mod odyssey permanent brain damage how I don't know is Bowser a tortoise or a it's just shaped like that because there are dinosaurs like the stegosaurus hello zuke see ya Benjamin you too one thing to be high quality and it's pain yeah but it's also a lot easier to actually I imagine it does take longer to make high quality odyssey models just because there are so many more options you have available we don't have a name for this yet no people have been making suggestions for how it should be called for the past few streams but there was no name where I was just like yes this is it this was originally supposed to be like a factory and it's just kind of slowly turned into an oil rig overbound oil rig that name doesn't rhyme and it's not an alliteration so no also I don't know what the overbond means if you get more I know how to work with odyssey shaders you can make a good mod but none of those people exist yeah I mean making a good mod is very difficult there's also the fact that people that are capable of making good mods probably already do video game production as their job so why would they want to pick up a hobby like that you know what I mean that looks spacey but kind of good I kind of like this it's like a proper color and then it should work I could go with like the usual color theme here but I feel like that doesn't fit bowser I feel like maybe his thing should just stay being black and red I don't know about this it just looks kind of shitty if you ask me and green I don't think green is the color for this level I find it so this is actually the one thing I care a lot about I care a lot about making the colors work together in a way that is satisfying right so if you don't get these colors this kind of works right we get some nice yellow and pink contrast maybe a little bit of purple some orange in the background but that that just makes me sad to look at ocean oil rig that's doesn't mean anything you like how the act select looks that's a surprise I was thinking of completely changing our looks because I don't like it Bowser's Boiling Bay okay that's something that's closer to what I was buying cake honka-honka did I need like like one of those clown horns and then just need to just hit it whenever I say that name points cake honka-honka Bowser's Petroleum Pierce bacon bakery what no not bacon bakery I'm not sold on oh what about ferry all right because bowsers for and stuff bubbly boiling Bay hello Biobak a it's not very bubbly though is that good my oh my god I want to show you the rework I did after Mario Bros 3 retro section I don't know if you remember it but what the fuck was that I didn't realize that level actually worked I thought that would just be a crash okay interesting anyway I know you didn't touch the 2d sections so that's why all the retro sections so that's why I reworked it because I noticed this one was ass so let's get there oily boilie bae it's a fun name to say oily boilie bae look at this we now actually have the sliding going on just like in Mario Bros 3 yeah I like oily boilie bae it's just a funny name to say yeah it's like eating me at my I made it a bit easier and made it so that the one place where you can slide there you go Oily Boily Bay, you know what, I'm gonna just set that as a temporary name. I think it's a pretty stupid name, but I still kinda like it. Oily Boily Bay. What else can we use that rhymes with oily and boily, maybe non-bay. Oily Boily Coily, we're not going with toilet. Oily Boily Coily, what does that mean? This looks like garbage. Oily Roiling Bay, what, it means nothing, just saying, I see. Completely understandable. Bowser's Lubrification Factory, Bowser's Boiling Oil Rig. Nah, that doesn't rhyme or anything. What about health meter, Mr. Case? Oh, what about it, Mr. Biobak? How's it looking? Did you finish it? Should I just import it? I almost forgot that that's the thing we kind of did. Okay, so we multiply texture zero color by a lerp between the texture zero color and the shade color and the primitive color. And the primitive color will be black. And this has to be combined color multiplied by texture one color. Okay, that kind of works. What the fuck? Why is she not doing the thing? You want the sprites? Wait, then what do you want me to do, Biobak? What do you mean, what about the health? I got two, but you won't read it since there are too many suggestions. Oh, well then, well, I did read the fact that I'm not gonna read it.  Awesome. Infernal Oil Spill. Okay, but Oily Boily Bay is already way better than all of those. I'm not accepting any name that's not at least better than Oily Boily Bay. So you have to remember, it has to be like an alliteration or like a rhyme or something. And Oily Boily Bay is kind of both. It's very stupid, but I like it. And it's really fun to say. You know, Oily Boily Bay is so goofy, but it works. Kinda, yeah. Oh, the building in red looks nice. For some reason, no, it just works. Okay, sure. Whatever. I kind of like that red. Yeah, it's nice. It actually works as a Bowser building. Yeah, that was the goal here. Are you just having like a little emblem there for Bowser? Yeah, that's the idea. Okay, I got an idea. Because now my Buzzy Beetle is pretty much done. All right. I will send it over in just a second. I want to go to Oily Boily Bay for some snack. Let's get those Oily Boily Bay red coins. Send the health sprites. All right, all right. I fear that if you do this on Discord, Discord will have them fucked. Can you put them like in a zip? These are the health sprites, by the way. What do you guys say? You like them? That's clean. That's nice and clean. Me and Biobak, we went through a lot of back and forth to get these colors exactly right. Because I didn't want the brightness to increase from blue to green. If you know anything about colors, then you know that green is a lot brighter than blue. So this is very difficult. Show the GIF. Here's the GIF. Well, it still kind of increases in brightness here, but not as much. Oh, wait. This is it. Yes. There we go. That's better. This is it. That's the old one. Yeah, no wonder it still increased the brightness. I mean, the first version that you had... ...was increasing in color a lot more, right? What was it? Yeah, this was the first version. You can see it gets way brighter here. We're not adding a fucking Twitch emote here. Please. This is a game, not a meme. This is a game, not a meme. You might say I'm stuck up for actually making sure that my game is not just a meme, but... ...this is what I want in my life. I'm stuck up for making sure that my game is not just a meme, but...  I'm stuck up for making sure that my game is not just a meme, but... ...this is what I want in my life. I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term. I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term.  I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term. I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term. I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term. I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term. I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term. I want a game that keeps me occupied for the long term. By sending me the file. LOL, I use WinRAR. LMAO Power meter, that's what it is, not health meter. Did it say unused here? What the fuck? Okay, so we're completely changing the way the power meter renders. Let's open our github desktop, commit this and then we do the next step. Can you animate the power slash emitter? What do you want me to animate specifically? We're very limited in what we can do, but we can do a few things. Hello Xeroclone, welcome back. Hello, get yourself a tasty snack. Minus 16 to 16. It seems pretty obvious that that's 32 graded, that's right. Why was it 11? I don't understand. Surely there was a reason these were 11. Or not. 992, that is exactly 32 less than 1024. 1024 divided by 32 is exactly 32. So 992 divided by 32 has to be 31. So this is only 31 pixels wide. UV map wise. Okay, something about this is weird, oh well. Emitter should scale in when it appears and refilling it should be smooth instead of just instantly adding a chunk. Yeah, I like that health meter idea by the way. Emitter should scale in when it appears and refilling it should be smooth instead of just instantly adding a chunk. I can do that. Yeah, I see what you mean. I'll make that note. We'll do that. These are actually fairly easy to fix so don't worry about them. Oh yeah, I had the crazy dream two days ago. In my dream I had put four totes over my game and they won't all play an instrument very poorly. And if you collected all four totes they would show up for the final boss and they would play country totes instead of whatever there usually is. I don't know if you had country totes before. Uh oh, no. Sounds like this. And you know what? I'm kinda doing this. I decided we're kinda gonna do this. We're not gonna make them play this poorly. We're gonna put three totes around. And if you collect all three, there's one in each overworld, they're gonna play a song for you in the overworld. I think that's what I want. They're gonna be hidden somewhere. It's kinda like the totes in a normal castle but in mode Muffin I find. I don't know. Okay, we got the bass Palamita. Five, four, three, two, one. Undefined reference. Oh, cause they're static. Alright, now this should be adjusted for widescreen mode. Fucked up Yoshi of the- Oh my god. I fucked this up. Let's see what's our fucked up Yoshi for the week. Oh my god. Undefined reference. What song is this? Country Totes. Alright, we fixed it for widescreen. Let's import Biomech's new assets here. I don't need this right now.  Palamita full, right side, left side. Okay, we don't need these two. Let me make sure they're not referenced anymore. They are not. Vertex Palamita base defined but not used. Good, we don't need these anymore. They are gone. And this one needs one for empty. No segments. What the fuck? Oh, it's an actor. Why is it an actor? This is very clearly not an actor. Oh well. What's with all the errors? A plugin not liking something? Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I have no idea how computers work. I can just program very well. Fifth of  turner and small  as someone tells me how to fix the issue with vscode not actually recognizing all the files than i will fix it but if not then unlucky and we'll just live like that forever we'll just say if you don't remember all the variable names and function names scale ratio just do it but yeah you can't see the new colors actually look so much deeper does that make sense um what the f**k oh i guess this was missing um redefinition of texture power oh i forgot to change this name okay they're compiled next half blood shown how the matches wait what the f**k we have a return in here there's no way that's legal yeah i'm using go to so i don't care nothing even comes close to being as fun to say as oily boily bay i think i surrender true it's too fun do we really need another matrix here do we really not have a matrix just on the stack beforehand that's insane hold on don't get not yeah yeah that's a spelling mistake so what it's a variable name it doesn't matter all right we need to go somewhere where i can slowly die why is biomex texture not here it's only there for the last one what is this i need to make clean it's a stupid compiler bug there are no variable names didn't matter when you drop far away in us on look don't hate on far away in this it was not distance all right it was far away in this me releasing the current would be devastating for the programming landscape as whole all right well i mean we do have to change the death camera but other than that it looks great to me i like it so we do want to add an animation to the power meter where instead or this year where instead of just disappearing or disappearing it scales in that's gonna be a little tricky but we can do that do we just scale it away if you are like out of water i guess that works i'm just coming to throw on something but after interesting in the background so that i can get some work done but i'm actually just watching and showing it hey that's also good yeah the maury head shape on the power meter is gone it's because the power meter was a 64 by 64 thing right it was a giant and now it's just a 32 by 32 thing so the head doesn't fit on there anymore can't it use a similar system to the health bar yes no the health bar can't scale the health bar also just appears out of nowhere um we need to put this in a more instruct because if we do multiplayer we need this for both so so you can also have had a sick ass name like parallax factor and you chose far awayness yes i prefer far awayness parallax factor means you need to understand the concept of a parallax far awayness everyone knows what far awayness is hello geica i am live every saturday yes that is true dude i fucking hate this i wish it would just show me okay is there no scaling matrix okay the unscaling matrix okay it's here why didn't it show up oh because it's not defined why didn't i find this i didn't what is this it's only used here an in-game menu.h it's crazy so do i need to pop matrices twice i'm not sure so i actually don't know how the matrices have to work rendering-wise let's see what happens looks kind of outcompetitive bruh uh maybe but there really isn't much we can do this is the only thing that will look good at n64 how do you get a smooth circle progress action i can show you in the blender module in a second oh you like that you like that how it scaled in huh you like that oh you like that that was so easy oh my god i'm so good at this what happened to this guy okay we don't talk about that okay this is um this model is gonna be unused anyway looks cool let me do the other one real quick as well um hmm so there we go we have rendered breath and then instead of breath here we just render breath not a big fan of the puppy accusations puppy accusations what is that what did i do i might have popped off and said something stupid so is that alpha clinic right i wanted to show my maximum breath meter let me show you um where's my general folder here breath meter you like that you like breath meter popping in huh oh fair okay so we have this here that's rendering them behind it's just one texture and then we have this in front now the thing in front has two textures the first texture is this one here and the second texture is this one right this one's obvious everyone knows that one the other one uh g4 right so this one controls the alpha threshold required to render the thing right so because the alpha threshold keeps increasing this part of the texture keeps getting more and more invisible until it's fully gone go who's a good boy who's a good boy who likes to wrap it up up again looks good i like it first try oh this looks so good unfortunately it ruined the pause menu that's cool do i need to pop the matrix twice or something pause menu is here pause menu is here that's what i thought let's pop the matrix again see if that works something can give the texture some depth so it looks more like a half meter how would you give the texture depth though did i rework the fork in the underground quest yes i did okay i needed to pop two matrices got it so that's how it works so hello lila lila look look lila we gave it a poppin and we gave it a smooth fill and it looks so cool now and we have the new health meter let's train the health meter again just to look at it beautiful you see how it gets darker unlike the original r64 isn't that great some highlights and shadows like you did for health how would that be possible i okay i guess okay well there's one thing you can do and that is in the bar texture here the brightness of the pixels also determines how much of the primitive color and the vertex color there is right so if you look at the vertex colors it's all dark blue right so by making darker lines through here you would be able to add segments to it if you want that i can send it to you and then you can experiment with it the blender preview is surprisingly accurate for this one i hope this is the right file so i think the intention here is to separate them separate what you don't need to see both your armies and health meter at all times hmm could be cool if you could make it so when marie starts to dive the health meter only the pie chart flips like a coin and then becomes this breath redancer oh i see yes that is possible but like i think that would feel very weird to see your health bar flip it's an interesting idea though i made a little thing a little thing it's a simple one oh like the logo for bowser all right oh we can mirror this yeah you can make it bigger if you want and the problem if you send this over discord is that it's gonna make the background white and it's gonna look bad so like put it in a zip i can't send it over discord anymore you never could if there's transparency uh that's kind of lame why don't you have why don't you want to have float positions for the ui because of n64 what's the size i'm looking for for this for rescaling you should order them as zook okay when the emitter runs out you could move the health meter closer to mario so the player knows they're losing health i was thinking of adding a sound for it i remember that mario's sunshine had a sound for it which you know actually now that i think about it is an argument against it because mario's sunshine is one of the worst video games to ever exist but i still think that it might be a good idea uh 64 by 64 but since it's mirrored you can go 128 by 64 all right but also this is already on a round thing so you don't actually need the transparency right it will be on this thing so then you just make the background just gray then yeah make it so it fits with the metal that's a spicy case of vanillian yeah you can do of course you can do 128 by 64 wait you didn't know that Biobak okay you can do 128 by 64 but if you do that you only have 16 shades of gray only 16 dude that would be a sick movie yeah it's a really weird fucking sex novel 16 shades of gray it's just like i don't know what it would be like but i swear it would be a funny parody so the game has some design issues but it's far from the worst you know what it's maybe it's not the worst game But it's the game that hurt me the most All right, here you go All right. Let's see it Are you made of 64 by 128 you want this in 16 shades of gray? Wait, you said 128 by 64 if it's mirrored. Yeah Unmirrored has to be 64 by 64 like this And then we'd also have to set this to 16 colors it would look like this It's still not bad. No, this should work. Perfect. Although probably best if you sent me the unskilled version Okay Wrong air meter blend file fuck let me find the right one If the folder is one also mirrored nice So if I just make the 64 by 64 right away it should work best I wonder actually what's gonna be the difference between these two They look almost the same But I think this one is a bit more detailed yeah, yeah, it's cuz I scaled it down in one step instead of two Fifty shades said it is a Twilight fan fix the six inches are gonna be like, I don't know. It's nice. It's so mean yet. I Don't know. I know I played Castlevania So Okay, so you're still gonna do it the weak thing where you work on multiplayer I am NOT 100% certain but I just might The thing is I have many responsibilities outside of just being a complete degenerate sitting in front of my PC and hacking all day So we'll see The man likes to work pulling eight-hour shifts on stream while working out and we're kind of be hypers fuck Yeah, we're just gonna have to stuff you in the basement or something what basement I Don't know I'll just go visit my parents if you're gonna do the eight-hour stream He's just gonna go there be like, yeah, my husband's kind of just fucking insane right now. I have to get out. Yes I'll tell you what. I'll come for a visit to make you lunch Or maybe I'll just bring you some fried chicken I Guys I brought case a fried bird. Here you go, honey. That would be so funny Of course we like can't forget the rice Listen if we're streaming when you're on vacation and you're streaming every day. I gotta make sure I meal prep properly Yeah, I am NOT cooking every day That's gonna be the case. Yeah Yeah, it's always weird to hear when you find out that streamers actually exist in the real world and they're not just like entities that kind of come into existence the one to hit the stream, but Isn't it? Bowser's Boiling Bay Yes, I'll just bring a teapot that's filled with chicken and I'll just cook it on the teapot Just like my mama used to make it. Yes That's a lie. My mom didn't do that No, your mom can actually cook and she's very good at it. Wait, are you saying I can't cook? I've been saying you can't cook since I married you Wow Can you believe it guys? Chicken water my favorite Oh My god, when do you go on vacation? When do you start your vacation? Maybe I should take my vacation at the same time And love next month I hope your mom didn't do that because I think that legally qualifies as child abuse No, his mom's a really good cook although Well, you don't like your mom's cooking all that much do you? No, I don't dislike it. Huh? I don't dislike it. Oh What's kind of funny that your brother and your dad would eat my cooking and they would complain your mom makes weird stuff Well, I didn't they always complain about the food that doesn't mean anything Which is weird your mom's are great. I loved your mom's cooking when I visited You know how nice it is having a meal that you didn't cook I think I finally understand how my mom feels about that Parents house and I'm the one cooking my mom Have I learned any of mama cases dishes good food is a privilege true You make it very differently no, I say good food is a luxury you can not just a privilege It's a luxury. All right, you don't need it It will be in separate model I make them I Mean Germans are supposed to be really good bakers to like apparently German pastry is Possible for a ramekin to have a wife seems uncanny it's because I'm really good-looking I mean, you're also Okay, you're not normal. You're fucking insane. Well, yes, but Compared to most nerds out there. You are a normal person, but I was about to say is Germany isn't the country famous for awful food here. No, that's Britain I think I think yeah Britain's known for having awful food I will give them that Look I don't know what's going on. But for some reason my youtube recommendations because we're talking about this right now They have been this like all the time This British Your YouTube algorithms are weird Then again, he also ruined my Instagram algorithm So I'm looking glad that it's not it's good. I like it I Ever go to Australia, I'll be sure to try the fish and chips. How did I ruin you Instagram algorithm? I made it better Keep going to the hospital I Did fix that scram yes I Was just running I don't know I Never tested the performance You all want a quick performance test of this just to make sure it's still running fine I Looks kind of fucked up, doesn't it? I'm not sold on this So this on Twitter and I immediately thought it was case time arguments Think you're a smart you study for 10 hours and got 90% I said right ornaments and got 99. That's 96% hours True he's right though I Shall import it soon. I didn't need to do a shell spin animation. Did I? Yes, but he just needs to go into a shell The spin is animated in game. Okay Okay, nice. I did not fix the calibration only though Yeah, and it spins in game Oh You in 64 testing yes When you when you touch the cable to the cartridge no, it's shit Show the army tough you can oh, yeah, I've never looked at the air meter in game. Oh there it was I Looks really good on in 64 like I'm kind of surprised that the quality is really good cool What is this In 0 2 2 1 7 2 2 2 1 7 1 Process masses. Oh, no, it's this crash again There's nothing we can do about this right now. That's actually randomly just happens on compilation Project 64 does ignore some amounts of crashes. Yes Oh Yeah, the clip ratio thing is still there I should probably turn the clip ratio thing off in this level just so we can actually look at this properly on n64 Because this is looking very wobbly Yeah, it's very wobbly I mean it still runs pretty well All things considered This stage this part of the stage already where it's kind of poorly it's not good And it's all RDP, well, we didn't do any optimization yet this might just be the worst possible draw order Can the breath meter be run in 45 degrees in game No, no, no. No, there's nothing we can't do that my mic. I know what the idea is. They can't do that Let's see the health meter and breath meter in game on the n64. Oh They're not showing up because of that Oh, there's a weird clipping thing going on you see that oh, that's not pretty Also the breath meter needs to refill if you're in the air This level still runs so well. God, I love this level on n64. Look at this, dude What kind of n64 game looks like this? Not even Donkey Kong 64 looks like that Period I just read it for the moment when you thought so I can have more freedom with the texture Hey, wait, what I don't know what you mean But I can't rotate it. I mean I can rotate it, right? Like obviously I can rotate the texture on the UV map but I guess maybe it works fine, but then you have like more pixels on the texture than you render in game and that would just Be weird Okay enough of n64 Yeah, that's kind of like an n64 limitation that the amount of pixels then you draw on screen should be the same as like the resolution that you have Yes, otherwise, it's gonna look really ugly Like if you can I don't know why everyone hates Goatus, I love him I Mean I like way too high-res. No, I mean it's twice the resolution actually on n64 So in a way, yeah, but hey At two times it still works fine Wait, what that's still meme, right? How do I not see still memes comment? What am I blind? I need to buy six. No, cuz then how would they text just fit together? You need to have both textures in there to multiply them with each other biomech And they would ideally be like I a 16 both of them Or it's gonna be kind of course like the rotation of the wheels are gonna look smooth at that point I Write back to this so I can I don't like how this looks I Mean the logo is cool. But the way the logo maps under here is kind of cursed Because there's like this gray barrier here. Yeah I Doing it I think it tries very hard this might work better I Let's do this so we don't have to index the colors What have been so cool of Metroid and an n64 game called Metroid 64. Yeah, how come it didn't? That's actually crazy. If it did maybe I would be into Metroid today Maybe that's why I never played Metroid because I didn't have an n64 game And by the time GameCube came out, I didn't like it So slightly better. Yeah, I think so Maybe someone who isn't me should make a Metroid 64 mod I Should endorse the octagonal chip and put these screws accordingly. That's a good idea. Can you try that? What? Put the screws into like the octagonal shape here How many sides is this an octagon is eight sides yeah but like you have to put them into the corners here yes did i remove the geonote lighting no it's just that it's not on this one here but i just didn't set up the geonote on it i can do that real quick on second thought i don't wanna wait can i take this put this here put this here join and join it like this oh i can oh oh that's good to know that's a cool trick so okay now about this this is where the strike's gonna happen and we want mario to come here and then be eaten by bowser strike breaker which is a gigantic oil block it's blending in a bit well i didn't really give the color yet i think this is just like the whatever color wait this is completely uncolored oh how come there's like no shadows on this so i think the preview is inaccurate there definitely should be more cut more colors on those more shadows and stuff oh wait wait a second do i even where's the light happening so how do i just have a vertex colors in this these here it should just be white right then i are all the vertex colors applied twice here i think they are oh my god i modeled this entire level wrong so so so something's really wrong with the ambient colors so why doesn't do this oh because of the fog of course of course  you have to get really close to really see it oh okay that looks very interesting i like this that looks like it could work a lot better gamecube was there to showcase the gamecube's tech no way pikmin doesn't look like a high-tech game at all that'd be like the shittiest tech showcase of all time so so i feel like that's no way that the gamecube is gonna run my crowds if you look at something like it already struggles at like five or six piantas guys i can render more moving npcs on my n64 than mario sunshine could on the gamecube i don't think the hardware really does the difference here so they are still i can i don't think the difference is polygon count i think the difference is in how efficient the matrix math is i thought mario sunshine still used matrices instead of what they used they also would be able to do that okay now it looks very cool dude that's the thing that makes me so sad about modern video games in general the fact that no one even thinks to use matrix animations i swear they are just so much better why not make this a feature and make it so you can slide over to bowser like this the uv mapping on this is difficult dude what can i do that depends on how good i want the romic to be chill gamer this one's gonna take thousands of hours it's gonna take years but i can also just make a shitty one in a day anyway me and zayna we have to head out later because we have an appointment with someone for friends to play board games it's gonna be fun i think we've made good progress today we got the breath meter in we got uh the health meter in we did a bit of uv mapping here we got a tower we need next we really need to make the boss platform here and then we can make this path and then i don't think we can add much more to the overworld because after that it's just gonna start lagging so hopefully we'll do that next stream and i'll see you guys next week next saturday bye bye bye bye
