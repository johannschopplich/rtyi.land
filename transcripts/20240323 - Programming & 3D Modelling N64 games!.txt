Hello? Hello? Hello? Let's export this level and get to work. Hello Nintendo for life. Hello CX-Linx, meowdy2s2w. We are going to be working on Boshi, the dino with the gun. There's a lot of stuff I worked on off-stream that I can't really show you guys right now. Wait, why can I not hear anything? There we go. Hello, Aaron. Yep, I'll be here every Saturday. Hello, B-Dark. So there's two levels, or well, two areas I made off-stream that I can't show you yet, because I'm supposed to keep it secret. But they're very, very cool. You're just going to have to trust me. I also, because I'm going to make a release for a ROM-Mech soon, which is, you know, the secret project. It's a small ROM-Mech. I also polished up the entire engine for it. Just whenever I was testing the game. Mario & Luigi RPG mod? I mean, could be fun, but that's so much work that I don't want to do. I have enough work right now with the projects that were my own ideas. New project is using this engine? Yes! Well, basically everything I'm going to release is going to use my engine. Hello, Steven. I also found some cool random optimizations all over the place. Interesting bug here. Interesting, interesting. That fixes that. Cool. Will it open Source when I release that? Maybe, I don't know. Alice is going to Disney tomorrow. Nice! You like Disney? I feel like Disney World would be one of the most miserable experiences imaginable for me. You're watching on YouTube, but you're scared? Why are you scared on YouTube? Gotta get up at 830? Goddamn, this sounds worse and worse. Any OST wishes for today? I didn't realize you could pause during this. Interesting. Persona 3 Reload? Alright, let's do it. I know Persona 4 was TS3D yet, so surely 3 won't be too bad. Why did you use Blender instead of other programs? 3ds Max is slow as shit. I think you might need a license, I don't know. Also, Blender is fast 64 and Python capabilities. And it is open source, which means it's actually going to be good in 5 years. Dude, I got a random email today. And this email just said, please look at my sine and cos approximation. And he just sent me two screenshots. And it's actually a pretty cool idea that he has. But that's so wild to get emails like that. Who else gets emails like that? Right, we need to program the countdown. How do we make the countdown work? I played Persona 4, actually. I kind of liked it. I don't know if it's a good idea.   I don't know if I would like to play another one, though. See, okay, what I like to do is I like to take a look at all the games I already played. And then play the next game that is different from everything that I've already played as possible. Countdown to what? To the duel. The idea was that you would stand up with Boshi here. And we'll say 3, 2, 1, shoot. Maybe let's look at Mario Party minigames here. Mario Party shooting minigame. Yeah, this one here. Yeah, I like that, I like that. But I feel like this text is not very expressive. This feels very much just like we put the thing as we had to put the thing, you know. Gameplay-wise, it fucking sucks, though. Well, it's RPGs, right? RPGs gameplay-wise are always kind of sucky. That seems inevitable to me. There's two options for RPGs. Or three options, actually, for RPGs. One, they're easy. Two, they're grindy. Three, they're math optimization problems. All three of these sounds pretty good,  but they sound like shit. Peach Showtime is good. It's nice, right? It's flawed but charming. I saw a little bit. It looks like there isn't much depth to the game, but there's a lot of really cool ideas. Like... It felt like it maximizes out in one direction. And there's gonna be some people that will say this is the best game forever. For a long time. That's what it looked like. But I only watched like a minute. So what if we just have a number code from small to big and then fade out. So it's like 3, 2, 1... Go! You know what I mean? Hello, Biobak. It truly has been a while. We thought you went to the Leela farm, you know. Dude, I wish I could show you guys what I made upstream. It's so cool. Hello, Michi. Michi! Really cool news. Someone just emailed me a new sine and cosine approximation that might actually be worth it. It was just an email. It said please look at my sine and cosine approximation. And it actually looks kinda cool. Why can't you show us? Because it's a collab with another RobMaker and he asked me not to. So... You should try the optimization. Maybe. But I'm not doing it right now on stream. Stirring the peace. You should break someone's trust for something true. Wait, a HUD countdown is gonna suck to program. What if I just make it the Mario Party countdown? Oh wait, even that's gonna suck to program. I think I have to do this in HUD. Oh well. Also, very cool news. Let me just show you what I did recently. I made this whole game... I made sure it all works on N64 now. I think we should be able to just run around in the game now without crashes. Let's see how long this goes well. Oh well. Hey! How fucking cool is that? 40 FPS before we even optimized it. You know what I never looked at? I never looked at whether the ship runs fine now. Nooooo! Okay, you know what? The overworld is fucked. Let me try that again. Let me try to look at course 5 on N64. But I swear I played the level for the heck that... I was developing and it looked fine. I also had a cool optimization idea for this course here. What we can do here... You see these beams here? We can make it so that they cull. Like right here. The two beams right here. We can just make it not process the triangles at all. We weren't doing that. Yeah. Don't worry though about the overworld crash. We knew something was wrong with the overworld. Okay, well. The overworld is really wrong right now. Maybe one day it will work. Today is not today. Western level music pretty much has the exact same notes as the catchy part of it I will survive and I can't stop hearing it. As to which one. What is this content I'm talking about? Okay, I'll just show you what I'm doing right now. Or what we're gonna be doing next. So there is... Let me just get there real quick. God damn it! Takes forever to get anywhere. I should just change the area to start. Alright. You see this guy? He's Boshi. Boshi the Yoshi. And he wants to duel with you. So I'm thinking there will be a countdown here that says 3, 2, 1 and then there's a random delay and it says go. And you gotta press B to shoot him. You're gonna be shooting one of those corp guns from Mario Party 2. Like this. Kirby Samurai. Oh, it's like a line that fades down. How does this work? Oh, I see. That is one way of doing it. You can make an open world, yes. What's with this? This song is fucked. It keeps changing volumes. We could just spawn a thing in world space. That's like, go. But I kinda wanted the countdown of like 3, 2, 1 Go. Hello, Welser. No. The gates to hell have opened. Goddammit. I couldn't even record my video this morning. If you shoot early your gun will blow up in your face. That's funny. I like that. So like if Mario shoots early his gun explodes. But like how? I don't know. We really need to get off the oily dear. It literally ruins my streams, my videos, my everything. There's a fan. There's a small suspense period. And one of you is blasted away like Smash. That's funny. But he's gonna throw an egg. So the egg is gonna be slow. I think that doesn't quite work. Hello, IonStream. Are you sitting in an airplane or what's the noise? It's the gates of hell that have opened in my house. So how? I was like, it seems like he's gonna aim  and shoot me from like from behind.       And maybe I don't know. Something is doing a good job of   vigilant life up or something. Hello, Ashi. Yep, hopefully it's gonna turn off again any second now. Please download something and video broadcast. I have it, but it malfunctions so often that I don't want to use it. How do we best do this, actually? Let's have it. Just like zero, we do nothing. Oh, finally, peace and quiet. I'm safe. The keyboard is so loud as now yeah it fucks with all the noise normalization stuff i'm begging the sound is on what do you want me to do all right you know what i'm turning on nvidia broadcast and i'm switching my microphone to it and then you guys can tell me if it's any good all right was that a heat tank what was that yeah all right this is nvidia broadcast classic crash classic baby refresh page oh it's working again you you cannot hear me what do you mean you cannot hear me why why are people typing nvidia nopecasts and microphone i can see clearly in obs that my microphone is picking up noise trolls one question type something and check if the keyboard is still annoying i am typing the whole time this is so much better but now you guys are lacking the asmr is this really like a trade you guys wanna can't believe it  you got a vape ad damn they're actually trying to sell you a cancer in a stick on my stream that is messed up oh well let's remove the gong sound let's see did you guys see the gong are you guys not gonna miss the gong if it's gone you need the gong back it's gone no no more awkward breathing noises when you don't talk today we lost a lot guys  so time reliably increased by one every frame take whatever so they were possible to check and not increase um if you change o action it's gonna reset back to zero but other than that no it will always increase actually if it's at um like a value of some 1 billion something then it will no longer increase it has an upper limit but you would need to wait in game for nine months so it's not gonna happen realistically my heart is wondering if they can fail in rare conditions nah they will never fail what if i let the game run while waiting for my son to be born yes i wonder actually if there are bugs in the original mario 64 that only appear after you've waited for nine months i think actually there is one that appears after midway i have i have a note for this the star menu stops working for two years and three months if you wait on the menu for two years and three months fun fact the dia diadox painting stops rippling after a week or so fun facts hello neovim the diadox painting actually is um floating point coarseness if you remember pylon kong's video about floaty the fish that's basically what's going on will the gun minigame take into account modern display like yes who do you think i am you think i'm a fucking scrub you think i don't know that the top human reaction time still something they do is like 210 milliseconds and then the console itself also it's like 80 milliseconds of input lag so likely we have to go at least 300 milliseconds on this hey there nick here as always in every stream i won't be here for as long so i guess have a great day everyone looking forward to hello nicholas i can just loop the timer state back to zero no you can't imagine you have an object that accelerates for the first 10 frames and then decelerates for 10 frames imagine you loop it back around after nine months it would move again dude the animations are the funniest so this is when he throws the egg this one's good this one's good i like this but the funniest is when he gets hit um when you hit them he's just so over it which i'm going to say this whole time but you need to wait nine months in game true surely that's true um i think this animation needs to not loop uh yeah let's see if the countdown appears and if he froze i also need to change this too hmm there we go oh yeah by the way you haven't even seen these guys aren't they cool what kind of performance are you expecting when you implement every next property well right now it's a 20 performance loss but once everything's fixed i'm expecting five to ten percent performance gain collect 10 million coins in a bowser fight and that comes around for four weeks that's obviously fake everyone knows you unlocked luigi by kicking the mirror 120 times wow that sucked you could barely see that damn that was awful also i'm right shifting by 32 and not by five i just realized hello can i conquer honka what did you miss you missed um us making boshy let me ask some suggestion and the curvy one how one was it i think we can work with something like that i want to see how this works first and um it doesn't work what if he has a redemption arc after you beat them and he moves into your results you can do them anytime for fun and he keeps records of your reaction time oh that's a really cool idea i like that i'm gonna make that now i'm gonna note it down here and uh characters that should reappear i'm thinking make the penguins reappear in later levels again if you have freed them for east exor stars boon that appears in a different level after the main story talking and makes them appear in the new levels after he was everywhere and reveals the story about his wife okay interesting another yoyoshi the yoshi mama borrowing from zoom right uh was she i like this idea and i will make for bonus content yes yes boonite should reappear somewhere and have like a little story you can interact with oh my god my eye is twitching so much i think i'm going insane oh interesting he says reading his own notes that he wrote look it's been a while so what is my notepad logout i don't update software unless i have a bug with the software so i'm still on 1.6 there's just no better emulator right now dude is it time for the weekly emulator rants oh my god i'm so excited three two one oh he threw the egg at me and didn't say go wow what an asshole i'll see i think it's good to like your own work okay so reaction time i was thinking you can have multiple attempts i am going to make it so that the first attempt is really difficult i'm thinking like 280 millisecond reaction time and then every time you lose you get like three frames more reaction time how much frames in milliseconds 100 oh my god i can't i can't i can't no no the gates of hell have opened once again but you can probably not hear it so you can't hear it at all oh my god i can it's so loud well as long as you guys are happy i'm happy too um let's find a good state variable here oh we can't actually use opacity damage or coin value there we go and we need another one oh no blue coins there we go um maybe just that two frames reaction time do you have any plans for smoothing out the camera when you end the stage from cutscene to mario not saying it's bad but could be smoother i was supposed to instantly cut does it not i don't actually remember i have a note somewhere in my notes saying to investigate that and make sure it works fine with 60 fps so that would probably be done in the same step  okay i am not a fan of the 321 i'll tell it to you as it is it does not look good we need a better idea here maybe a more animated number like a shaking number but hey that's also named do i really actually i can't just make it a hot element what if we just render it with like a scaling matrix three two one one go there we go all right that's that's not too bad that was a little bit of a long wait it's a number it's three bullet graphics then two bullet graphics then one bullet graphics not sure i understand that correctly it'll tell you something to indicate that a go is coming and the game is frozen yeah i can kind of see that i'm just thinking about this this is probably just a shitty game to look at right second i think that just isn't a good game to look at make the weight shorter but more random i did that uh don't know if you're in the brown so i could just use this Then instead of having the number be static we can have it like come in from small and where is the hotlet to find? main hotlet? yeah main hotlet and then we just go 4-boshitaiwa perfect music goes mute and then you shoot as soon as you hear the clock ticking the music should go mute that's a good idea I agree and then you know my kicks the number of screen a quick drop in in game let's see that hmm it looks very cool the camera frame is also so much nicer it's maybe we should take something more camera framing like that let me look at my cutscene again maybe I don't like the camera framing here yeah we could move the camera in a lot more right have it be cut off at Yoshi and at Mario let's try that oh god how am I gonna how am I gonna just guess the number I can't letterboxd what does letterboxd mean but that's actually a very good point we have to make sure it also works on 423 shit let's not get it on 423 that's more important hello eggy yeah that's what I usually do machine yeah we can cut a good bit of this off here oh that would be so cool you're right that it would be very cool but it's so much work he does look like lady of skrttlskrtt that is all on purpose gotta reduce the x values norm and not just that we should also increase the z value wait increase the z value so 7060 and reduce the norm of this maybe reduce the camera height a little bit let's try this two pre-rendered images that scroll in opposite directions oh you just want this overlaid on the screen that could work yeah yeah yeah I think that's that's definitely doable and worth doing okay this is not good yet we need the camera further in we need it further to the left and we need the camera further down so further in we can do like this further to the left should be like this and further down should be like maybe this and then the render focus probably should be a bit up we'll make a whole like hot widget out of it kazini okay we need the camera to look further to the left and we need the camera to actually have these guys be in vision can we split it into smaller chunks yes we can should be more over mario's shoulder no I want the dual camera okay just that something's better and other things worse eventually we'll figure that it's a lot of trial and error on unfortunately because we can't just preview it all right we just want a little more mario and a little less yoshi and then we're there and then we can move it back to widescreen and look at it all right I think I like this now that's not widescreen is it widescreen resolutions no it's not there we go yeah it still looks fine on widescreen so that's some way you could preview in blender I think you're gonna miss benefits I'm not sure it's even possible maybe if you somehow figure out the correct viewport size and stuff wait what if we do it kind of like this that looks kind of nice oh the ost is over we could just have it be a cutscene let me just close this folder it's supposed to show like the 321 actually ran that right that's that's very very good actually and this is rendered as a rectangle and not triangles and of course it's a fire yeah that's true yeah so let's not count down actually let's just say fire let's just um maybe we'll have the camera on him and then the camera on mario and then the camera zooms out there's a random weight and it says fire how does that sound yeah I think that works so actually it should be something like we'll draw and shoot at noon or something and then maybe we can just animate the clock here in the background how would that be we just have the clock here and you shoot at noon I think that could work um we have no music so we listen to my favorite song can I take some randomness for now yeah all right let's just say we'll draw and shoot on fire all right we'll just make a cutscene fuck it this is painful to do without a cutscene so the first scene will just be looking at boshi do we zoom in or out from him maybe we don't zoom at all it goes to black and then it zooms out from the scene it goes to black it comes out of black it's looking at boshi and then it's gonna look at mario that's what we're doing let's try it we're gonna have a second it's not like noon minus 15 minutes and then that moves in three segments and it's a noon with the last second being random yeah that's what I would have thought but I also no longer think that's a very good idea what area is this? is it not area 2? it is oh but the boshi scene is not part of the area the gates to hell have once again opened guys I need an ost so I don't hear the gates to hell  it's the hellost now mario kart 8 deluxe all right let's do it beep beep so there's that amount of time then randomize wait until begin beep but the fire text comes up let's just draw minus broken clock strings no one to account for the randomness yeah that would work but I think we're doing this now I'm gonna mess up in a comp when a cool thing sit with the desert level I'm thinking temple but a bit iffy pyramids so my favorite hex I don't like hex maybe star road is one of my favorites this is return to israel in 64 yes it is madness true best text it's good starting resource for the n64 development probably the homebrew dev discord somebody mentioned The youtube side of chat is the more sane one. I guess the twitch side has been here for longer. That's the one that's gonna go crazy first. The more comfortable you get, the more if you're crazy you show twitch chat. Right, I forgot one thing. I don't think time accumulator really matters here, does it? Yeah I don't think I need to set this. Let's try that again. I think I already like the boshy one, just maybe I was talking a little too high. Let's try that again. Wait, nine months to the Rafale duo? That sounds like good game design. Can you believe Zeyna's on babysitting instead of making games with me right now? You can, damn. Such is life. Have any of you ever babysitted? I feel like my twitch chat is mostly male and men would almost never babysit. Oh, that's a perfect scene. Where's Mario? We got a few issues. On Kaz's wet dream, let's see what this is. Wait, why would this be for me? I'm not into Peach at all. This also lasted way too long in my opinion. Well, I'm not into Mario either. Yeah, Peach is very kid-friendly, like a Disney princess or something. It's good that there isn't much to be into. You do goombas? I like big goombas. You guys remember that song? Oh, where's the cutscene? You know what, I should make Mario's eyes half-closed while this is going on. It would look so cool. Can I just set this to 1? I think I can. I think the blank star looks more funny, like Boshy's putting his life on the line and Mario's just in for fun. Maybe, but it's such a cool detail. When we don't do anything, he's just kind of blinking all the time. We should look at it at least, just to make sure what we like better. Maybe it's going to be really funny all of a sudden. Can we kick Squinting Eyes just for this cutscene? He already has Squinting Eyes. That's the crazy part. I thought about adding a voice count on. Nah. Is that how I got Zayna? Is that what you think? It's kind of annoying for other languages to rule. I didn't even think about that. There's one really weird frame here. Oh god. What? Why? Why, why, why, why, why? It also didn't update his eyes, which sucks. Maybe I should just set the eye state to 2. I'm clicking true. I still need the table here. I don't need this, or this, or this, or this, or this, or this. Actually, I do need the hat. I hate having this many files open. Would it be hilarious if Mario farts during his close-up? I want you to think about what you just said. Think about if that's how you want to live your life. I don't know. This does not work for elimination. All that humor was so disgusting. I didn't even like it as a kid. I always thought it was nasty. Saying bro self-reported is very funny. I said that to someone not that long ago, but I forgot what it was about. To 60. To 60 is not enough, or is it? Maybe it is. But this really needs to start the frame earlier, because this doesn't work at all right now. What if we did this on frame 19? And then this on frame 20. It's for writing fart jokes. Okay, do kids actually think that farts are that funny? Or is that just something that movies psyop us into? Because there's no way kids thinks farts are that funny. I just don't believe it. Oh, there we go. Still does this. And it didn't even say fire. Why is my camera doing that? Right, but it's not about what you think. It's about what kids think. Unless you are a kid, in which case you probably shouldn't be allowed on Twitch. Actually on YouTube, never mind. Oh, as a kid that made me immersed to watch a movie and my parents would fart jokes. I guess I felt offended to even add that image. That is funny. Wait, did it render fire and I just didn't see it? Chat, is this real? Wait, no, it didn't. Had it written fire, then we would have seen that somewhere. Should make Boshi fucking explode. He'll get corked. Like in the current Mario Party minigame. This is what I want. This is my vision. Well, except he'll fall down and cry. I don't know.   Game. So the camera focus did feel like one of them was kind of not in there. So I'm thinking of just moving this one slightly to the side. This one. Slightly over there. Let's see it. And the cutscene hopefully doesn't do the jumpy stuff anymore now. I do not know why I had MS Paint open. If you can't believe that a fart debate started, you've never been to the stream. We debate about everything. Craig's a bit over the top, don't you think? What if he just acts like he got really, really hurt and sad? No, no, no, he's like... It's like the little toddler cry. Not like an actual cry cry. Still does that. It doesn't say... Now it says fire. Great. Awesome. Oh, it doesn't say fire. And because it can't during a cutscene. I also noticed one issue in Boshy's rig here. You guys see that? That's not good. There we go. Surely that's not going to ruin everything else. Clueless. Oh, it doesn't. Cool. Now the only mystery that remains is why the fuck does this cutscene fuck up like that? Does it have anything to do with the focus being weird? What if I set the velocities here? Let's try again. Have you guys played Chibi-Robo for the Nintendo Gamecube? We're playing it right now. It's pretty fun. Bowser can't kill Insta. Mario Boshy would have to be like the strongest character if he could insta-kill Yoshi. True. But he has a gun, you know. Bowser with a gun probably could also insta-kill Mario. Hello, G-Boy. It's okay, you get a tally. Don't get another two or you'll get permanently banned. Oh, that's nice. That's nice. I like that. Just needs to be a bit faster. True he is a mortal that is an advantage is dry bowser like the bowser version of dry bones like have you ever considered that bowser is just kind of like he is a koopa right just like a really big one so of course he would also become dry bones but like what about all the other koopa variants can he become those too is there like a red shell bowser that doesn't walk off ledges there's a blue bowser he has a brother i'm not up to date with the lore clearly all right this is great okay nicole if the whole ramen game came together made a super optimized version but all their okay i just think in real time patch all mods well i mean they're making heck of r64 and you can see how that's going that's basically what you want two bowsers and mario bros 1 oh but that's just a bowser in different lighting that's how i interpreted that is it really his brother the hell all right i think next up we should program the egg that he froze the two bosses in one of the levels what oh he's in the last levels he's not canon he's a japan exclusive he doesn't exist in our world is there gonna be a yoshi egg yes splash would be a good addition to my collection i've seen this it does the sound too and we get this here too much monster re yeah that's pretty accurate  decimate awesome this is just what i wanted the fact that holds open means that there's an issue had a yannick there should be no holds that open when i decimate so this is clearly having some issues meaning we just fix the back then we didn't even know existed honestly it's not too bad at decimate 0.5 we just need to fix some uv mapping i don't really want to though i want to just support it actually maybe we can do like 0.75 yeah i'll just fix these few uv mapping issues and then we should be fine because i don't want to import this many triangles because this level already has a huge ram issue the sack is also going to be really small so if there is an inaccuracy you wouldn't even see it so well a lot of people tell me that they're worried that this game is going to get taken down by nintendo but i never understood what they think that would look like like how would this go down would nintendo come to my house and like delete it off my pc i never understood that like it's technically not even online yet so but they just politely asked me to stop so they would kill me ninjas with nunchucks okay but the nunchuck sucks as a weapon i have plate weight plates here i can use them as a hammer i would absolutely beat anyone with a nunchuck so they will stealth attack me oh i see dmc takedowns on users will likely be their first step but they've already taken down 70 of my videos so like they already did that so i shall edit this texture a little bit because they didn't want them to be online i guess they took down like blender tutorials i made not just mario 64 stuff you guys want to see the funnest video in the world so this was back when i was developing net64 they decided to take down my video where i showcased wario in net64 just like a new character i had added and after they took it down i re-uploaded it but without any nintendo content so this is what it looked like so nintendo just took like 20 videos of mine down so i'll have to um remake them hopefully without infringing on their copyright um so uh let's start this yeah all right i'm a number one i'm a number one and um these goombas they die when you do that and then i just run around and i'm a number one i'm a number one okay so for the next scene we go to lethal lava land and just kind of go yahoo i don't know what i'm saying there you should do that for every video i think not so should i let a copyright free version of the akiba a trailer when it releases they will absolutely take it down and i will have to release a copyright free version that is gonna happen and you know it  hello why can i not scale the fuck so turn right from the start so you don't lose on views i can't turn right from the start that would like get me no views at all from the get-go give us a yoshi impression how's that  you can call me charles martinet so  now when you upload both versions so if one gets taken on the other one is still up and you don't lose on the time it takes to re-upload oh i see honestly yeah i i think we're gonna do something similar to that because i'm gonna bundle it together with the ad for my kickstarter for the game i'm gonna make after i'm done with return to yoshi's islands so it's it's all gonna work out i i have the advertising plan down return to copyright free dinosaur island released i guess ben and pierre told me to tell you you're doing a good job true i believe you my uncle also works at nintendo actually he told me not to listen to you he told me you're an imposter i was thinking some source code from mario kart 61 building a hybrid platform racing level i feel like if i wanted to take racing code mario kart 64 is the last place to look fazan has told me the horrors of that game's codes i want nothing to do with that so i made the egg way too big it's like needs to be um maybe like 20 coordinates it's two thousands so do you guys actually realize how crazy it is how close we're done to being done like only three levels are missing and i already finished one area of that that's like end game but it's still gonna take a long time but still it's like it's the last fifth of the game that feels like end stretch to me it's gonna take months but still i'm pretty happy about that so i think release before 2026 maybe oh probably actually i don't want to guarantee anything the one thing that i'm worried about releasing is that maybe nintendo releases a game around the same time as me and if you release your romhack around the same time as a big nintendo game comes out you are going to get taken down 100% like right away so that would really suck each level has seven stages and you have to complete them all and the total game is gonna have around 180 stars something like that so but only 120 of those are gonna actually maybe like 130 of those are gonna be real content a lot of them are gonna be like yoshi stars people are gonna speedrun this i'm pretty sure replacing everything with an osc is gonna take quite a bit so at this animation frame we want the egg to be right here so we're just gonna take the curler position here and have that being like computed left offset is 52.5 negative so up is 98.28 and then they usually don't go after hex though they've definitely gone after my x before that's the thing they went after the missing link they went after last impact they went after net 64 They went after the missing link after like three days. The game had like 300,000 views on YouTube. People fucking loved that shit. It was such a good game too, honestly. So it's really, really unfortunate that they took it down. I feel like without Nintendo's interference, I would have a million subs by now. No exaggeration. Maybe not a million. Maybe like 800,000. But a million is possible, honestly. Actually, yeah. Had Nintendo not interfered, I would have made a lot more videos. Maybe keep the release on your Patreon. I'm not making any Patreon exclusives. I don't want people to even think I'm trying to bait people into my Patreon. It's animation frame 14, actually, that we care about. What did Nintendo take down? Nothing, nothing. People are just scared that they might take something down. Yeah, that's basically how it's going to be this time. Situation where Nintendo actually hired that man? I don't think so. They're big corporations. Big corporations are really inefficient and they all just hire their nephews and stuff. Oh, perfect. Perfect. Operate inbreeding, kind of. Hmm. This feels not like what I'm supposed to do. Let me try something like this. Let's see what happens. That's 14 frames to go. 20 coordinates up. So maybe like 2.5. Actually, let's try 3.5 and then set it to 3.5. Something like that. Is this the last of the course? Yes. Maybe they brought on the Ineos guy for the Wii WC. I see. Could be. It's just, yeah, the thing is, had they actually brought on emulator deaths, that would be such a funny story that people would just chat it a lot. So even if it's not a real story, I imagine people want to share it a lot. Okay. The positioning of this is a lot better already. But the Z position of this is not good. It's way too far forward. Let's try this and also give it a random pitch. How come the egg can't just be part of the same model animation as the Yoshi and just starts super far away for nothing use? Animations do not have translation in Mario 64 except for the first one. All right. All right. This is better. 25 to 29 and then 0 to 14. So that's 18 frames. So. I think this will be good now. It's all just rotations then? Yep. All just rotations. We don't even have scale. That's likely going to change once Leela is finished with her Quaternions, because they give us free translation as long as we don't use it. It still feels too far forward. It's the crazy thing. How does it feel too far forward? He's seen this. It's set to minus 14 here. I'm just going to force it to minus 25, see what happens. The enemy is also a little slow. Well, he's relaxed. He's chilling. Stereotypes animations eventually are based on blend shapes, but it's all vertices. None of what you just said is vertices. That's all you get. Scale from breakfast is going pretty well. I would say. This is all just C. Okay, that works, that works. We have him juggling the egg. Make the MSMG start accelerating up before frame 14. So it looks more like he's catching it. Are you thinking... So I'm moving up. Then he throws it up here. So you want to decelerate here, starting frame 6. I'm guessing what you want. We can do that. Let's try it, fuck it. Sucks that we don't have an animation system to use. Would make this so much easier. I don't do all the models by myself. I mean, this one here is all by myself, but usually after I'm done, we got Biobak looking over it and he makes them a lot better. Check if it's less than 14 as well. Oh, fair point. You know what, I'll use 25 because I'm evil. Hehe. There's some assembly in here, yeah. But it's not a lot. Wolf. Set a shotgun, yes. I'm making a ROMACC, keep the original hardware in mind, I'll just optimize for emulator and downgrade afterwards. No, I don't optimize for emulator at all. I just do for hardware and then the emulator is hopefully good enough to play my ROMACC. Make numbers 0.5F and 1.2F. How did you determine these? But you are right on saying that these are not good. You know what, I'll try them. And if they look bad, we all get the license to love that patty death. Did you actually calculate those? Hehe. We all get to love that cocky death, let's go. Oh, that's a good one. Like we needed that to make fun of them, damn. Get roasted. I think 6 is just too early, it should be like 8. I'm stopping, it should be more instant, I think. Yeah, that's what I thought too. Yeah. Yeah, I think actually frame 10, because then we have 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. And that should look a little better, I think. Just like 4 frames to decelerate. Oh my god, we're gonna have pizza tonight, I just realized. I'm gonna have my wife make a pizza for me tonight. Aren't I living the best life? Looks too much like it's bouncing. You know what, fuck this, we're actually doing the math here. I want this to end at 5.5. I want the egg to move with this, minus 13, plus 25, minus 14, divided by 5.5. Multiplied by, actually. So now we get 5 at the end, and 4 here. Then we have 26, 27, 28, 29. And from 9 to, that's 4 frames, and then 13 more frames. So 13 frames of deceleration, 4 frames of acceleration. So this should be 20.5, divided by 4.5, multiplied by the cell. And then, it's multiplied by the cell. So, 1.5. Damn, we're doing that cocky. What about 5 divided by 25? Fair, you win this round. Making your body do the math for you, true. Yeah, the game detects save states. So if you save state in the game, a space-time Yoshi appears and tells you not to save state. And he will rap at you. That's better. That's better. What a clusterfuck. We stumbled upon the Yoshi raps again, and they're very cringe. We will need to have them remade. What? Wait. Let's fill this out. Don't disagree in the timeline. Such an attack is not fine. Your save states are rude. They ruin my mood. So listen up, dude. I have a feud. I come in peace, I mean no hate. But I've seen you using a save state. Next time think about not doing that, please. I have no other option than to break your knees. No? Is that wrong? What do you mean? Cringe desu? What? They're nice. Don't disagree in the timeline. Such an attack is not fine. Your save states are rude. They ruin my mood. So listen up, dude. I have a feud. Yo yo Yoshi, I come from space. I know you're a good guy, but just in case. Save states will soon ruin your fun. If you use them, I've got a gun. That's perfect, dude. I like this. How will the shoot-off work in multiplayer? Also, the drop version was kind of crap. Show a bad example. What? No, man. This goes hard. I think it's funnier when you just read it in-game. Wow, it's munchmustaroo. I just picked the first two. I like them. I think you're being haters. Funny, do-kill-bill music. Hey baby, shut me down. What? There's a missed word in the Shiger dialogue? Which one? This goes hard on me, right? You guys don't appreciate some good lyrical rapping skill? Because I'm playing hide instead of hide and seek. I'm playing hide. Oh yeah. Well, none of them is seeking, so they're just playing hide. It's kind of a joke. Zweigreime? What? You know what? True, there are Zweigreime in that. But I had to write 16 raps. Okay, 16 raps about a save state Yoshi from outer space trying to kill you. You tell me you wouldn't put any Zweigreime in there. It doesn't rap if you don't mention sex or drugs. Kinda, yeah. I think we need to give Mario the gun. Good thing UED has sent me a model of it. What does this funky word mean, German boy? It means forced rhyme. It means you're saying words just because they rhyme and not because you want to say the word. I'm doing a degree in literature, let's see what I can do with them. You wanna write new rhymes? I'm up for that. Send them my way. How do I send them to you? I have you on Discord. What's your Discord name again? I don't see you. I can't find you. What's your name? Sometimes Discord bugs. I will DM you. Alright, this is free. They're kind of all over the place. There's more. 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. Oh my god, we wrote so many. Upload this file. It won't let me send this. Oh wait, it does. Now it's so many, yep. There's one where he says he sends you to Brazil. That's the one I don't like because I don't like that it references Brazil. But on the other hand, it's kind of out of world anyway because you're safestating. You're not doing something legitimate so I think it's fine to mention Brazil. You and which AI? No, chat. This was before AI was even a thing, guys. Your safestates are rude. They ruin my mood. So listen up, dude. I have a feud. I'm Yoshi from the time patrol. I watch over space-time. That's my role. I've seen your safestate from inside a wormhole. If you keep doing it, I'll shut down the console. Oh, that goes hard. Oh my god. I do not want Brazil to exist in the game. I play games to relax and I don't want real world tragedies to be mentioned. Did I hit the tone of voice right? Why is gun word exchanged? True. I know exactly what you're referencing to, Biobak. This gun's fucked up. Well, it's just one material. No, omfg. Not that I complained about there being a lot of black characters in GTA 6 because video games exist to escape reality. Wait, what? I thought that was about anime. I thought that was a guy complaining about anime having black people in it. Not GTA. I feel like the GTA one is like a shitpost version of the anime guy. I think the anime guy was serious. I don't think it was a shitpost. Man. Okay, so attaching this gun to Mario's rig is gonna suck. Okay, racists just don't play video games. Well, it doesn't even make sense for GTA, right? I don't think there's a GTA without black people. Do you even want that? What? How does this guy, like, does he even want to play GTA? How did this guy even get to that point where he was complaining about that? What was he expecting? Does Mario support second amendment rights? I don't know. I think it's just cowboy. The guy never played San Andreas. Yeah, or any other game, right? Weird. Mario does not call 9-1-1. Mario, when someone breaks into his house. Fucking happy noises. And foot scaler. Can I just make this a health object? Oh, god. Oh, okay, so this doesn't actually attach to the hand anymore. This just moves it in front. I don't mean, well, yep, everything is all right. Someone make a GTA style Mario hack. I made one, kind of, although I never released that, but I kind of made one. Okay, we can't use this. Okay, we could maybe attach it to the actual mesh. And foot scaler.  interesting bug. I didn't know this. Can I release it? Yeah, only me will play it. I will charge people $10,000 to come visit my house and then I'll let them play it. Where is this? The gun? What are you talking about? Where is this? I haven't heard anything about it. Oh, did I never show this anywhere? Maybe Mario 64 with guns. I swear I made this somewhere. Wait, please Mario 64 with guns. Yeah, it's like this. I just showed this on my case clip channel, but I never released this. Anything new in the hack? There's new stuff constantly. Right now we're working on giving Mario a cork gun. It can shoot corks. Okay, I'd like to render this without actually making a part of Mario's cheerio temporarily, because we're gonna be using inlining and bleeding later, and this is gonna make it terrible to do. In case I made this with you, I meant this hack in limbo or cancelled or something. Yes, the guy that paid for this to be made hasn't paid for it in a while, unfortunately. And I don't want to just, you know, spend a lot more time on it. He said maybe he wants to continue at some point, but I don't know. We'll see. I'm surprised you made this with me. I believe you, but I didn't realize that. But I also never thought about who made this with me. It's been not something I was thinking about a lot. The new micro-optimization saves 200 microseconds, roughly. We could absolutely render the gun on here. That's not true. See, X-Links. But this is also not good. This would cost performance permanently. I don't want that. Let me go in the scene in-game, see if I can find some stuff to use here. Hmm, I don't want to make it just float in the middle of nowhere. It's not gonna look good, obviously. He is pissed. He's ready to shoot. I'm just gonna put the gun in a Mario rig and render that. I don't want to import a separate Mario rig. I want to make sure that we can use this in the future as well. Surely there's some kind of solution here. One micro-optimization before stealing the level, true. I have it in the rig. How does putting it in the rig help? Just copy Mario's animation info and everything and you are golden. You wanna have the gun be like Mario's entire rig, but only have the gun attached to the hand and then render the gun with the same animation frame as Mario. Yes, Leela, you will notice. You can't just save, you can't just lose 0.2 microseconds all over the place. That's just bad practice. In the end, you're gonna lose like a lot. We're not starting with that. I can see the vision now of copying Mario's rig and attaching the gun to just his hand and then rendering an invisible Mario with only the hand visible where the hand is the gun. You seeing my vision here? It would work. I'm doing that. I think that is the most performative solution here. And ironically, that is the solution. I was making that suggestion before you said you'd want to use it in other places. I feel like either you misunderstood me or I misunderstood you. Can you copy Mario's hand bone rotation and position? The problem is Mario's hand position never exists. All that exists is Mario's hand matrix. Same with the rotation. And it only exists for one blink of time in like a weird state where you can't really read it. So, I mean, we could capture the matrix, but it's gonna be expensive. So I'd rather just render an invisible Mario with nothing on it. I gotta copy the scale from the Mario model. Stupid-ass game. Well, it's just because my render is so efficient that it doesn't hold on to anything useless. Just the way it's programmed, it just so happens that that won't work. Technically, what Leela is saying is something you could do, but we don't want to do that because it's bad. Why can I not select these? Using invisible Mario to attach a gun so that it moves with Mario, right?  Does the rap Yoshi is so violent then? Rap has to be violent. I didn't make the rules. Actually I did make the rules. Dude, what is going on? How do I rig a model again? What the hell? Was I not parented correctly? It was not. You need to use vertex groups? Yes, it wasn't parented correctly. That's why no vertex groups were there. Gun paramedic.  Yeah. Switch challenge has no mash charlotte. Damn it. Start. Dementia setting in. Why? Where am I? Arrow right open hand armature has no mash charlotte. Okay, who cares? Who cares? Why do we care that it has no mash children? I don't understand. I don't understand. Yes, but only during this cutscene and not during the entire game. That's the thing I care about here. Leel has rapidly approaching oldness. I would ask you how long until you're 18, but that's a dangerous question to ask. Someone could clip that out of context. I don't wanna. I tend to open. What if we just delete Mario? Nope. But next thing I can ask how long until 19? Yeah. Wait, how old until you're 65? Oh, this was the issue. Left hand open hand armature. Hey, I think we did it. Me check garden armature. No such file. Me check such garden armature. Why are you trying to export it there? What? What kind of bug was that? It's very screwed, but it's not set to deformable. How is this not deformable? Oh. Less than 48. Well, that doesn't help. Is that export now? At least it does. Okay. So now that the next one's like this. We just need to. Someone move it back here. Yeah, that should work. Yeah, exactly. But I wanted to hear like 47 years and two months. You know, she wasn't the guy. Would you be the OT guy or perhaps a different game? Maybe Sonic Adventure guy. Maybe that's what I would be. I used to see a long time ago. I think you can use assembly. Yes, but. Just because you use assembly, you're constantly going to run faster. In fact, most human written assembly is going to be slower than compiler written assembly. So unless you know exactly what you're doing. And you're willing to put in the effort into every single line of codes. Do not bother. There's a lot of stuff we can remove from here, fortunately. Probably a lot more than this. All right. Let's try this. Weird code snake. True. 47 years and six months. Oh, you're still still very far away from not being a baby then. See a Catlin.  That's an interesting name, though. I have no idea how to pronounce it. Usually have a good idea, but. Actually, we might as well just make sure it's always renders. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Okay.  Pose and angle. To all from G Mario stage. Mario OBJ. And then.  Had a 38. And the nation. The hell. Wait. There's a better way to do this. Just copy the thing from Mario. Where the hell is mirror Mario? Oh, we can just do this. I think there's a currently a bug with the mirror Mario, actually. So that kind of sucks. I don't know. Your birth and gift will be kicked out or something. You actually think that. That would suck. Name Catafest and Miss Cat. All right. I'll go with Catafest. Let's see if it works. Where's the gun? Where's your gun, Mario? Not good. I don't have the gun scene out of nowhere. Must be something not getting reset. It doesn't seem like too bad of a bug. Wait, what? Where's the Yoshi gun code? Oh, it didn't even compile. Because I named that Mario gun in one context and Yoshi gun in the other. Cool, cool, cool, cool. So the test just now means nothing. Just the feeling thing. But Leela, look, okay, you can program. You're not going to be homeless. You can just become a programmer somewhere. Still doesn't render. Oh, my God, look at Mario's shadow. Oh, my God. And you're familiar. Why is all your text red, ZXLinks? Are you banned or something? I'm bad. I don't know, but every text you say is red. Look at this. Of course, you have to import it. Can you stop being red, please? Yes, you're bothering the people. Unbelievable. That's what text means. It means he's banned. He's a ghost. Wait, wait, look, I sent the children to the children. We just had two Mario's in the same spot. Whoops. I made the gun into Mario, is what I'm saying. No. Come on, be there. Gun, gun, gun, gun, gun. Yes. I got the gun to render for free. We did it. Oh, my God. Everything's like all this stuff here. One, two starts. Wait, open, open, close, close. Oh, my God. Why is it nested so deep? To make rendering free while it's not rendering. All right. I think we are finished here. Now we just got a program. I'm actually shooting next time, but we're not doing that today. I did what I set out to do. I'm very happy about this. I will see you guys in the next stream. Bye bye. Oh, my God.
