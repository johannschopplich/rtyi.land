Hello, sorry I had to run to the bathroom real quick, but now I'm here. Hello Paper Kitty, hello Stelton, hello Bobby Lizolol, hello Akio, I did take the vanish cap. Hello Bingus, because I'm making more games like Mario Land in the future, maybe? Where am I? Why is everyone saying share? I'm here, I'm right here, hello?  I was working on some new sound effect features, but it's been quite nasty to say the least, so I'm just gonna emergency exit that for now. Basically what I'm trying to do is make it so that two sound effects per bank can play at the same time. This would seriously improve the sound effect quality across the board. Hello Lila, hello Alster, you had that idea Lina? I'm making it so two sound effects can play at the same time, isn't that fucking cool? Right here, two bank sounds are selected per bank. Alright, let's listen to this, chill and nostalgic Nintendo summer music mix. Your projected release date?  If you died of a heart attack or something, does your wife know how to release all your work to the public? I'm sure she could figure it out. I'm sure someone like Lila would tell her, huh? Oh yeah, Fazerna could do it too. There's like 10 people that have access to Return to Yoshi's Island. I also have a private repo with all the assets, so nothing would be lost if I died. But it's not like I am dying, so please, calm down. If you die, can I be granted the rights to everything? I'm definitely trustworthy. I wouldn't be lost if I died. I mean, I myself as a human don't have much value, right? The values in what I make. Oh yeah, I did almost die yesterday, two days ago. I don't think there's an inherent value in life, but that's just me. So do you think a world with a million happy people is worse than a world with 2 million happy people? I did almost die. So we went to pick up something from Kijiji. And their neighbors had three big dogs that all came running and barking at me. And I thought they were gonna attack me. And I did almost fucking punch the dog and get into a fight with them. And I'm not sure I would have won the freebie one. I don't know. I always read your name and I'm like, I know this person. I know who this is. And then I can never tell who you were exactly. Okay, I don't think I should be working on this right now because this is too complicated. So we're gonna be working on this. Who is messaging me? Zayna. Oh, Zayna is sending me pictures. Yes. Look what a nice region we were in. Oh my God, dude. This is like the perfect place to live. And they have gigantic tadpoles in there. So many. See why you're waving? I did. I am not familiar with the use case for YUI. But I'm sure there's at least one. Also, also. Have you guys heard of the low-pitched booloth in BigBoo's hand? What the fuck? Have you heard of the booloth in BigBoo's hand? I think I know why it happens now. Oh, please, dude. Okay, I cannot reasonably fix the sound effects right now on stream. So I'm just gonna do this. Because of the door pitch? No, that's wrong. You may have heard that explanation, but it's wrong. And I see why people think that. Because it looks like going through the door triggers it, right? But the truth is actually so much more fucked up than that. Let me show you. I posted this on BlueSky. Hello, Askel. Hello, Askel. So you're seeing this. When you slide. You heard the wind noise just now. And you heard the boo noise right after. What's really going on is that the booloth is just a part of the wind sound effect. For some reason, I don't know why, the N64 and Mario 64 designers made the booloth part of the sound effect and placed it at the very end of the sound effect. And usually you don't hear it. But when you cancel the sound effect, you do hear it. So, for some reason, when you go through the door, the sound effect plays in full and the low-pitched booloth becomes part of the sound. Yeah, it's there. I can show you. Let me just show you in a clean Mario 64 repo. Here, air howling wind. Gen, set bank 6, set instrument 9. Let's go here. Sound, samples, 6. There's one missing here, so this is 9. That's the sound. And yeah, it's weird that this happens, because what they do is they delay it for one frame, and then they play it again, and then they play it again, and again, and again. So you never get to this. Well, there's another 199-frame delay, and then another 100-frame delay. So there's 299 frames of delay before it jumps back here. And the layers loop forever, I think. It's weird either way. And I'm guessing the channel gets interrupted or something. So they have the two sounds together and put a loop point right before the loft. They start in the layer, and then... Okay, when you start the layer, the instrument is set. That's going to be the instrument until the layer is finished. So they do that, and then afterwards, they set another instrument, which means that if the layer restarts, it gets the new instrument. And apparently, when you get near... This is another thing, actually, part of the bug. What plays the sound is the merry-go-round, and it plays it as long as you're in the outside room. But when you're near a door, Maury's room changes. So then it stops playing the sound every frame. So, yeah, it's... It's like a weird timing thing, I guess. You want to see Co-Pilot? I don't know if I can use Co-Pilot. People will get really mad at me if I do anything AI, or if anything AI touches this game. And I don't think AI really has much of a use case for me right now. Definitely not enough to justify people being upset at me. Okay. As long as I'm playing right now as AI ProfilePic on YouTube, it just stopped playing. Oh. Okay, having an AI YouTube... Having an AI ProfilePic, or just like ugly AI art, is definitely some sort of signifier that you do want to support, like that line of thinking, and not because you enjoy that art piece, I'm pretty sure. So that's just you being a dickhead most of the time. It's so good for autocomplete. People only get mad at AI visual art because it steals from others and looks ass. Nah, they get mad at anything AI. I saw a Blue Sky post yesterday, and that was like Kayce showed JGPT in his last video, and he said it's ass. But now he's dead to me because he used JGPT. I don't know, maybe I just shouldn't worry about stuff like that. But it does suck. I think someone's using JGPT anyway. Uh... I'm not sure. I don't know. I don't know. That would be pretty cool, keep them. I guess it wouldn't be stolen stuff then if I allowed it to do that, right? Hello LemonGuy, I don't remember what. That's true, is he gonna? No. Did I miss a message from LemonGuy? Oh, I see. Well, if you ever use Photoshop or GIMP, I'm pretty sure like even the brushes at this point have some AI features that they use. Like it's very difficult to avoid if you really wanted to avoid it. I don't know. Okay, what's the next shader to think about? Maybe this one here? Do we want a new one even here? Or does this look nice? I think it kinda looks nice. What if the map is done? 9%. Yeah, definitely my lag. I remembered that Leela. That was very silly. What if we multiply this by 2 to get like more contrast here?  There was another person that said something like Case is dead to me. And I'm like, why? And they just deleted their post. Some kind of interaction like that. That's so bizarre to me. At least tell me what I did wrong. So I can maybe avoid doing that. Unless, you know, you don't really stand behind that. How's the wife? She's pretty well. We need some new discussion material. True. Did we actually talk about it that much? I thought that was rather rare. What about politics? I have decided that my new excuse, and this is actually a really good excuse for not ever taking a political stance on anything, is going to be that I would say it's all culture war. And I believe that we shouldn't be talking or taking stances on this because it's just rather markets a divide. You don't want to take away from the message of pure schizophrenia. And I think that's a pretty good excuse. These leaves are kind of ugly. Does Mrs. King play N64? Yeah, we're playing with Jurassic Musk right now. Is it possible that sea foam or water foam are even better tactics? Yes. Dang, that's crazy dark ways. I did not realize that. Lila, isn't this supposed to work? Am I doing this wrong? I guess my text is in the wrong spot or something. Yeah, that's what it was.  Did you actually get them? That's crazy. But I guess that is a smart move because you either do that or you probably die. Yoshi redesigned to be long again? Is he long again? That's cool. It's not actually a problem, but I find the discussions here interesting. Oh, you mean when it's other discussions? Fair enough. I don't know if he are you. Will you do that? If he can, you put my optimizations to the vanilla engine. Could you do that for me? Okay. That's way better. Now, for the shader, I think I also want something that can be a little sun-kissed. Does that make sense? Again, my message is pure schizophrenia, I will not be discussing any culture war issues. The media is forcing you to have these discussions so that poor people invite and you don't actually start a class war. That is my message now, and I will say this forever, until I get killed by the CIA. Wait, that's Wolk? Oh goddammit, that's not Wolk. Which means schizophrenia, conspiratorial thinking, in which people are conspiring to keep poor people in control. We're building a file on case that's already 5000 pages long? That's not well optimized. Surely my file can be much shorter than that. You guys need to go back to the drawing board. I think this palm is a little nicer looking now, it's so glowy. I did know Awesome Mario, I was once paid money to do a Roblox stream, and I played Mario in Roblox. Well, Biobak is probably going to change it anyway, so don't worry if you don't like it right now. I'm not trying to put too much work into this, just like get this semi-decent looking, so Biobak doesn't puke when he sees this. You've seen worse, gee what a compliment. Any reworks you missed? No actually, it's been a while since the last rework. That's true, Miamek, because you told me that it's fine to do that, and because you told me you had good ideas for it. This is a big fucking level. I should have my repositioning. Why? Why would I want Ride All? Oh, Ride All is the good one. Goddammit dude, this is so contradictory, I hate this name Lila. I am, it's just the name is very counterintuitive to me. Well, to be fair, Biobak, in the meantime I've been upgrading the engine, so it's not like I've been making too much progress on the content either. I don't know if I could make a decent Super Mario World tag. The problem with me making a Mario World tag is that I don't like Mario World, so I would have to look at that and I would have to think what is the fun in playing Mario World, and I would have a really hard time coming up with an answer, because I don't find any joy in that game. And I wouldn't want to work on a game that brings me no joy, so I'd have to put my own spin on it that's completely different from the base game, where there's a different type of joy altogether. That would probably end up with a romhack that people that like Mario World would not like. Does that make sense? Don't like 2D platformers? I absolutely hate 2D platformers. CM and console right now, works pretty well. No complaints from my side. Ugh, it's missing contrast. Well, that's to be expected with this kind of combiner. Okay, yeah, this is a terrible idea. Hmm. Should we maybe work on the seafoam next? Go with cove? Me? Oh wait, I can't end that right now. I think the game doesn't like that level right now. It doesn't have proper trees. I think these trees look very nice. I don't think the trees are an issue. What do you think of the water? Do you guys think the water's fineness is? Well, actually I've heard a lot of people say that the water looks very good, so I'm assuming it's fineness is. Um, but I think we should add the foam to it next. It should be the next step in waterology. You know what? I'm not gonna optimize it for now. I think that's nonsense. I'm gonna do that optimization stuff at the end. Just make sure it renders fine. And then we do foam. Yeah, the water is kind of a banger. But what I really want is foam around here. Let me think about how to best do the foam. So the foam needs to be matching the water vertex size. The foam needs to be around the entire coast. And the foam needs to be UV mapped correctly. The foam needs to fade out when it's down and in when it's up, I think. Don't kinda mess with the browns of the boxes and trees still. Yeah, you're right. Why use 1.6 even after discovery of vulnerability? Well, I'm not gonna hack myself. And all the other emulators are completely unusable garbage. So as long as I can avoid using other emulators, which is every time I play my own hacks, I am going to avoid it. That does not mean that I recommend anyone else uses this, because, you know, I could be evil and try to hack you and anyone else could be evil and try to hack you. But there's no reason not to test my own with 1.6. Ares and Parallel are both unusable for me. Well, I mean, Ares is usable for debugging, but definitely not for playing. And Parallel is a fucking joke. I will never use Parallel. I think we've had the Parallel discussion like 15 times by now. So like gimbal lock discussion. Exactly. This feels like the gimbal lock discussion. I don't think my hack even works on Parallel right now. And the fact that they basically test the production in Parallel, like, come on, man. I don't want to deal with that. At least let me avoid interacting with Parallel for as long as possible, which is until the moment I release my hack. It actually pisses me off so much that on the last RTYI demo release, I worked with Falco to fix the bug that caused Parallel to crash on my ROM hack. And then a week later, I released my ROM hack and people didn't get the update. Because I don't know what happened. Some Parallel bug. And then also another Parallel bug that caused the emulator to not work for a bunch of people. Like, come on, man. Like, you know, don't press update. Well, this wouldn't have been a problem if they didn't test in production. Do you know what the bug was, Lila? The bug was that you couldn't use the last byte in memory because of an off by one error. Parallel is probably a mess. I don't know about that. You can use CTRL-L to select linked on the tree. How does that fix anything? Yes, the very last byte. You couldn't use the very last byte in memory. How did you actually use it? When you decompress data, I just put it at the end of the memory. And at the end of the decompression heap, it says the file size. That's how the J0 or whatever file format I use works. So the last byte would just randomly be read wrong. Yeah, gzip, right. How wasn't that tested? How do you write a thing that checks that you don't go out of memory and don't test that you actually still have a memory or like, at least, you know, don't make that bug. There's no game that does that. A bunch of games do. Mario 64 does that. Out of the box. Actually, no, not Mario 64. But if you use decomp and extended memory, it does that out of the box. You can go stats counter at the end of the game. I think that would be very fun. We are already capturing the playtime stats. So, total jump stamps, playtime deaths, damage taken, coins obtained, save states. That's quite a few stats. But I kind of like it, yeah. Are the waves done now? I think the waves are fine. Next, I'm thinking about foam. And how foam would look. So, we could just have a white layer that fades in and out as you go here. But I don't know about that. We could have a foamy texture that is clamped and UV maps around this whole area here. And also has a vertex alpha value maybe. Do we even... Yeah, we do need a vertex alpha value. We can just multiply with the height. We could have this be like a multi texture. What's... How does foam actually look like? So... Like this. So, when it's high up there is foam and when it's low there's no foam. Did I get that right? So, I'm thinking... No, nothing. High it fades in. Two layers going left and right. And then just vertex alpha. Did they? Transmask Bay. Great Bay. Yeah, I don't think they did shit. Yeah, they didn't do shit. They just faded it out. Yes, yes, we are 100% using foamy water, we're just thinking about the exact implementation details. You can change the amplitude of a wave based on the maximum amplitude of an edge. You can have the polygons near the shore be fully flat and decal and animation on top. I can, but I don't think that's a good idea because I don't think it helps. I was gonna have the foam just exactly match the vertices of the waves and then have them move up and down too and while they're up I'm gonna have them be more opaque. I looked at the Wind Waker graphics and I could tell what they were doing immediately and it looked terrible. I'm gonna do something much nicer looking, I hope, and it will look a lot more realistic. Is it flat though? Doesn't it go up and down on the shore by the way? Isn't the idea that when the waves are up that's when the foam comes and then when the waves are down the foam disappears again? I'm not sure, it's so low that it's basically flat, I see. I can definitely make the waves go flatter as they go further in this direction. I think it's kind of when the water crashes on the sand, what you're trying to do won't look like IRL I think. Okay well I think the idea is definitely that we cut out something along the shore, also cut out the water, have all the UV maps be exactly here and then we can still- wait what What if we just do that and then we can still make it flatter if we think? Because we're gonna have to match the vertices anyway. Hold right near by setting with the height of the wave. Yes that's what I was going to do. Fill in the actual water too please. That would be difficult to do but possible technically, but it's a lot of overdraw. You won't have to match the vertices. Huh. So you just cut something out along the shore that looked like foam. We can give it a try, let's add height control to the water first of all. Let's see, we want it to be basically zero around the shore. Let me do that. I'm gonna control the height via vertex scalars. Foam is greater than tropical waterfall. True. I know the foam texture thing made me see people in the main water and then the extra foam in the corners. Not sure how you imagine that. We already have a two cycle texture, we'd have to add like a second triangle above it. Can I see the waves? No. You wait your turn. Boy. Is this Despacito? Oh, we used the distance from origin for the water face already. That's what you had on your underworld. That did look decent, but I don't like that there were no directional waves in it. Yeah, I see what you mean. But let me think about this. The problem is, we don't have any more storage space and I need to pre-calculate the wave height somehow. We still have the red, blue and green channel on the vertex available to us as data. Problem is, we also added those at runtime. The vertex alpha is also already used. So that's not going to work, unless we did something weird like bits of vertex alpha mattering. We could use the lower bits of the red channel for the wave height. I think that might genuinely be our best option. Doesn't really look wrong, does it? Okay. I don't know, this is just a playlist in a sense. Yep, this is exactly what Biobak wanted. Let's go. Oh, that actually looks really cool. I like that.            I like this a lot. Yeah, this is perfect. The board was pretty at some point. Anyway, I think we want to be a little more selective with our wave height reduction. Awesome, one person. Big rate. Someone's rating with one person. Yo, don't blow up my channel, please. We're just a chill little gaming community. Do you think the deck should have support touching the floor? Yes. So, I think these are the zero height vertices. Now, it is going to have supports. Calm down, man. I'm working on it. So, I think this is exactly what Biobak wanted. We got big waves over there and then small waves here. Or, well, no waves at all over here. Looks pretty good to me. And we still got waves here, which I like. Next, let's make some foam here. I don't know if he's still, like, drawing something or if I did it wrong or whatever. So, he hasn't said anything. I'm assuming I did it wrong. Too bad, that's salt water. Why do you want to drink it? Being a little water drinking boy. Let's see. Fully flat, sentinel, maybe. Yep, that's exactly what I did. Awesome. So, I did understand your rights. Okay. That's my furnace in the background. That's my furnace. That's my furnace. The furnace is out. We're all saved. All right. Please do not buy KS Jania, she is not good protein. Yeah, she's like 10-15 grams tops. Yeah, that's messed up. What happened here? Okay. Okay. Okay.  I'm going to add realistic time calculation based on the moon orbit.  Take me for a jump. This is not a woke type game. We're actually going to be realistic. I shouldn't I should not have said the word work. We're going to have two hours of politics again. Should this be? No, it shouldn't be in there. I just do a question. So I should probably have one for me texture and one wavy texture that scrolls. I think that's the optimal setup for this. Like one could be something like this. Or this which isn't this the exact same texture? Or it could be this scrolling sideways. Hello, Don Coyote. How do I reconcile this issue here? There we go. Split into mirror, mirror right. What the fuck? What the hell? How is it so difficult? What the fuck? There we go. We're working on games in Canada, nope. None of the games that I've worked on have released yet. I've only been working on professional game development for like two years? Two and a half years? There we go. This corner here is a bit weird though. What if this texture went back and forth on a sine wave? You should start seeing blue like me. Oh, I should start saying blah. Do you say blah a lot? You see I'm old. Not with the times like that. How have I been streaming? Wait, how have I been streaming for an hour? And how have so many people been asking me for the release today? What is going on? Did someone like post somewhere, hey guys, let's all torch a case by asking for release dates? It would be hilarious, I think. This should just be a clamped texture. And then I can just do that. What the hell? UDIM? What does UDIM mean? Leela, what's going on? What have I finished the game and then asked people to donate $50,000 before I release it? Leela, what's UDIM? Help. UDIM is mega texture. How is my 64 by 64 a mega texture? What the hell? It says UDIM here, then it's just loading the wrong texture and I can't do shit. Huh? This is not good. This is some weird blender work. I can't load my texture. What the hell? If I can't attest to PNG, it works. What the hell? I don't think so. But how many reworks Biobak is still gonna do? No shot. And we're still missing the final Bowser. We're missing like five side levels. You're gonna have to wait. You just have to sit still and wait, man. Shouldn't be this hard to wait. You're gonna have to see more of the fun whether you play it now or in two years. What the hell? What the hell? That sounds more realistic. I do not live on Saskatchewan. And I don't think I have a Canadian accent. I think that's just you confirmation biasing yourself because you know I live in Canada. What the hell? All right, question. Are we ever getting material labels? Or should I just make a workaround right now? Because I do need material labels for this. I'm not doing the stupid fucking segment idea. So if we don't get material labels, I'm going to make an init function now. That finds the index of the thing I need. The phone needs to run after. So I need to find the two set tile size comments. If they're not getting labels, then I'm going to make a function that finds the first tile size function. After the texture pointer here. I guess I have to do the upstream though. She's gone. Canada Canada's pretty nice. One, two, three, four, five. That's the wrong one. One, two, three, four, five, six. Shit. There's only one tile size comment. So I need to hopefully bleed independent works. Please tell me it works. Lila bleed independent doesn't write the comment, which makes sense. But wait, it does. Nevermind, we're all good. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. So. One, 10. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Why is scroll bit flag defined so many times here? Twitch chat is that. That sucks. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.  Works first try or not. Okay, well. The potential isn't there, but this was horribly wrong. Okay, that's the wrong thing for one.  Definitely also the wrong bit flags. Okay. Kind of makes sense. Okay.  And that scrolls way too fast. And the phone doesn't scroll at all. Not cool.  Some sound stuff. Don't worry about it. Okay. Is it not clamping? It is not clamping. Why not? I turned off clamp for some reason. Definitely would do it. Okay. Okay.  Did you hear my plate? What? What about it? Material labels yay or nay. Is it possible? So nay and I agree that they are hacky. Okay then I need to write a workaround because I'm not working with the dogshit segment thing. So I'm probably just gonna write a function that takes an texture pointer and then it finds the first displayless comment after the texture pointer that matches some bits that I specify. Why? Because the other idea is dogshit. I do not like it at all. Something went really wrong here. Well it looks smooth but something's wrong. What if we disable the secondary scroll for a second just so we have a better idea of what this does. Oh wait I think everything moved. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, nope it's still here. It's not a normal human being by the way. It doesn't, there literally is no upside to it. I heard them out, there is no upside to it. Absolutely no reason to do it that way. Hansel and Gretel do you see this? The weird texture thing? You broke something. I'm on the def writing PR. It's not you? Well someone broke something. Yeah I'm pretty sure I'm not touching the wrong comments. Well I mean I'm counting 10. So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Right here and that's why we need material labels. You already have tags you just don't export them. Wow. Okay we have an issue here and that is it popping in and out like that. Why is that happening? I think that's how it works. Well it makes sense and you just won't export them? So you already know exactly what to do and you already have it and you just won't export it? Damn. Does this not work because, wait 12 bits, 12 bits is, 12 bits should be enough right? To do this animation? Why does it not work? What if I halved the resolution of this? It would probably look better anyway. Is there that Karel? Shut up. I don't even know what to do anymore man. Tell me if the actual DL is wrong or not. Well it has to be because I exported it and now there's a bug. I'm wrong after you edit the film? Yeah. But look I can disable the entire film animation and it's still gonna break because I'm not writing to the wrong BluSplitist comments. See? There's no film animation now. It's still broken. Now I may be writing to the wrong one. Let me check. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I'm not sure. Yeah there's some weird shit there and I don't know why. At first I thought it would work. Dude why is it so impossible to just do a sine wave scroll on this? It does have sine. It is supposed to have sine. But for some reason it's not working. Is there some limitation I'm not aware of? Like it's supposed to just look like this. And then come back. We can still rescale it afterwards. That's not the issue. Although I do want the film fully gone. But I'm okay with it only going to here and then disappearing again. So really the issue is that I should use a smaller animation range. And it should be 128 I think. No we are currently at 59 megabytes. What if I just say fuck it and rotate this 180 degrees? Does that fix the issue? Hello I'm Johnny Pac-Malien. I'm doing moderately well today. I'm having some very unpleasant issues. So does it scroll to the left? Is that what's going on? So I need to start at the leftmost part? Or the rightmost part? Like so? I have not and I'm not interested in it. It looks like garbage in Wind Waker. Okay there we go. That looks semi-decent. I think it's out for a little too long. But I like the going in phase. So maybe a smaller multiplicator is what we want. No I don't think so. Maybe? It's also missing the sideways scrolling. So it's gonna look a lot better now I hope. Yeah it's not going far enough out. 56 maybe? There's no additive blending on 64. I think I like this. Oh that's cool Haddock. Unfortunately Haddock is not on my top three favorite fish. That would be number one eel, number two salmon, number three Heidelbutt. Shrimp? Shrimp is not a fish. Okay Leela you're gonna fix the bug with the transparency? Who's gonna fix that? What's going on? I guess I can figure out what's going on. Let me just see. I will tell you what the bug is right now Leela. The bug is setting the render modes. And then wait we actually do reset it. I don't know what the bug is Leela. The water glows blue and the sand looks a bit weird. That is true. It's not really supposed to look like that. I think it's because we're missing some vertices here. Hello diddettes. Anyway we got nice water now. Right now we just want to set up the basic shaders so that we can make the level look pretty. Geneva is what I would be proud to rule. I don't know Mustafa. Not something I think about right now. I make the game. That's what I do. And then maybe I make another game. But for now I make the game. Let's see. Multiple edge loops of course. Modus N64 API. Do you think it would look better if the foam would stick to the surface of the sand so it's still fully visible even at the peak of it's cycle? No. Can I play some relics movement on the water as well as the shaders? Wait. Have you looked at the water? It's moving all around. It's just not moving near the shore. Because that's how water do be like I guess. Look at that. It looks bad. I can't do that Biobak. I can't play with people's feelings like that. I'm moving on the shore looks a little odd. I think it looks fine. But if you have any complaints about that you need to complain to Biobak. So I meant the API as in the SDK rendering API specifically. I don't know what these words mean. I've never received a software development kit. I'm not sure what a software development kit is. Is it like a physical device you get? Genuinely I am clueless what you're talking about. He's been given enough money to eat. We're in a bit of a weird situation because of tax laws. Well I know an API is like an application interface but it's the N64. There's no application right? It's the console. So what does this mean? It's rendering as an API SDK. Same with Laboltra. Let me try to make sense of that. So you're asking if I'm still using the same library to interface with the N64 hardware communication stuff? The answer is no. I am using the N64. The N64 is doing the rendering. So I guess I'm not using a library. Asking which libraries you're using to interface with the N64. Then the answer is heavily heavily modified Laboltra or straight up just my own functions. I don't know, there's questions that seem obvious to many people, where for me it's always like I have to first really ask what they mean, because a lot of words have dubious meanings and people don't really realize. So I don't want to say anything wrong. This is the come-let's-eat-grandpa situation, you know what I mean? Not artistic. Viopeg, you can't be saying that, you're gonna get me sent to the camps. Yeah, my stream always has a shit ton of delay and I never know why. How do you unselect something? What the fuck? Is there no way to unselect the vertex? Am I just now realizing for the first time you can't unselect vertices in the UV editor? Shift-click, no, it doesn't work. Okay, this is a fucked up situation to be in. This plugin is very useful, but the fact that it makes you plug holes like this first is annoying as shit. If whoever developed that plugin is watching, maybe me filling in the holes like this gives you an idea on how to solve this without me having to fill in the holes first, cause like why did I have to do that? You know what I mean? Very cool plugin by the way. You should do the PS1 port. You do it. You can make it for me. I will give you the permission. Oh my god, you talking about how the PS1 is poop reminded me of some good old gamer forums that I saw where people, there were two people arguing and one guy is like, I will never buy your shit Tendo 64 and then the response was like, yeah, yeah, whatever dude, go have fun with your gay station one. Bro, how do you recover? Good old 1998 gamer rage. Nintendo shit cube. Not familiar with that one. What the hell is this one doing here? Oh, I see. Is it the one that's like, if you buy a gay station, you're either a slur or a racial slur. I don't remember that, but that definitely sounds about right for the rest that I remember from the conversation. This is the shit cube. So this is my Xbox one. This is my Xbox 360 right here. All right, I can't watch that. I'm sure that was on par with what I saw though. That's true. This gen of consoles is kind of special because there's actually like hardware differences and they can actually like do different tasks, different competence levels. And in a way, that's kind of cool. Also, I realized yesterday how much everyone is hounded by the budget and time constraint trolls. That's how I'm going to refer to it, where it's like, oh, they couldn't have done better because they have budget and time constraints. Because I saw on Twitter, someone was saying, hey, why did software in 1998 and 2004, why was it so much faster than it is today? And people genuinely, the most upvoted or liked reply there was because we have budgets and time constraints, so we can't optimize it as much. And that's gotta be the most bullshit garbage excuse I have ever seen. Like, oh, in 2004, they didn't have budgets and time constraints? Back when teams were 95% smaller and like barely anyone was buying software? No? You didn't have a tighter budget? You don't think so? What the fuck, man? That is very stupid, but that's how people are, man. They just jump at the first thing that sounds good. Companies now are building games to take more effort because the graphics are more realistic, but at the same time, no, I'm not talking about games. I'm talking about fucking open office. Talking about Google Chrome. That's what they were talking about. I haven't seen the Half-Life W2 document. I don't even like Half-Life. Is there a reason to watch the documentary if I don't like Half-Life? Yeah, I wasn't talking about games. I was talking about software. Of course it makes sense that with games being so much bigger and consumers not really caring about that extra polish as much, it doesn't make any sense to spend all that time on performance. Parkinson's Law? Parkinson's Law? What? What's that supposed to mean? See the comments on the independent shot? I have not. What did he do? Can we even consider this game a 3D game? It's more like an HD 2D game. Poor guy. I know Panin is also someone who at least used to feel pretty tortured by his viewers. I really should have UV-mapped this. At least a little bit better. Firebax is not going to completely redo it. He's going to keep some of the UV-maps I think. I bet he knows more about the game than the original developers at this point. I bet the original developers had no idea there were billboards in their game. Hey, seamless. We did it boys. Seams are no more. I think we should make all devs use 4GB of RAM laptops to touch them and write them better codes. True. I succeeded. With what? Now this cannon here looks like a dark ship. Also I would kind of like to have the whole thing here as well. There was a pan and I didn't understand it. I will now die of cringe. You can't find memory architecture as a standard? What? No. Don't we have video RAM nowadays and stuff? Not on consoles? Really? I thought we were at the point where the Nintendo Switch literally just comes bundled with an Nvidia graphics card. That's pretty chill. I think I should UV map this one first before I do anything else here. All we did was add foam. And some UV maps, but I do like the foam, it's good foam. I like the foam, it's good foam, it's good foam, it's good foam, it's good foam, it's Is there significant performance to be saved by removing the Fish Jumpy Stance? Since that's one fuel model to load. No! it doesn't save any performance at all to do that. It does save a little bit of memory, but this is actually a crazy thing I do. If you look here... If you look here, I have one Z-Buffer Segment. That's like... This one's barely ever... Oh, this is only ever read by the RDP. And then next to the Z-Buffer Segment, I have all the Graph Nodes, which is where the fish would live. So by doing it this way, because we so rarely read these, it's basically free to just have these here. Because they're only ever read by level building or whatever. So the fish is basically entirely free, and it's mostly living in a memory region that goes unused. Okay, I want a different texture for the cannon. This one obviously looks pretty terrible. I think we should make it out of metal. I also found out another character that Charles Martini voiced in Mario 64. Might make another video about that tomorrow. At that time, I'm going to use my sound composer that I showcased today to make the sound live. And people can guess with me what it is. I won't reveal who he voiced though. You'll find out tomorrow in the video. Bowser? I don't know if he voiced Bowser. That would be news to me. Oh, I remember now. Yes, something something stuck sound effects, and it just happened to be Charlie Boy. That strictly speaking still doesn't mean I know it, because the bar for knowledge is pretty far away, you know. Yeah, that's a sleek cannon design if you ask me. Kind of like it. Very cheesy design. Yeah, I can kind of see it. It's probably not that great. It's just my signature style. I guess I do like to work with symmetry so long, just maybe because that's what feels easy to me. So So What the hell? How does this look so shit? What have I done here last time I was here? Huh? So That's wild. Oh, I guess this is fine. If you have enough patrons around us, would you do this full time? Um Yes, actually, yes, for sure, yes. So If you guys ever heard of Kindness Luigi, I was introduced to Kindness Luigi yesterday. I haven't watched a full video. Is this? I don't understand it. 64 He is kind to me. Call an evil Mario so he can be kind. Luigi is kind. He is so big and nice to everyone. He likes butterflies. He is so kind, he likes butterflies. How can one man be so kind? Luigi is kind. Luigi is kind. This feels like a song that would play on Simpleflips channel on loop for like 15 hours. I know I made in 2010 and would have done numbers, true. We need to send the OST now. We would have unbeaten Mario 64 encounters and so kind as Luigi. He just stared at me and didn't want me to have a great day and booted the game normally. So it's like a happy pasta. From what game the previous music was? It was from Mario 64. That song plays when kind as Luigi spawns. If you make a noise and people explain Mario icebergs of theories, you get 400 hours of insane shit. Like to this day there is still way to know if Luigi is still lurking Mario 64 waiting for someone to unlock him. True. If only there was a way to verify whether Luigi exists in the game's code or not. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  Actually, the people that work for DKump were paid off by Nintendo to hide Luigi. I'm in on it too. Nintendo just really doesn't want us to find Luigi. Here's what big DKump does not want you to know. That should be in my next April Fool's video. That should be in my next April Fool's video. That should be in my next April Fool's video. That should be in my next April Fool's video. That should be in my next April Fool's video. That should be in my next April Fool's video. That should be in my next April Fool's video. That should be in my next April Fool's video. So, it's never too early to get ready for an April Fool's joke. So, it's never too early to get ready for an April Fool's joke. So, it's never too early to get ready for an April Fool's joke. I bet that's gonna break everything with the film. Well, it did break the film, but it didn't fix the issue, of course. Anyway, I think this is good progress for now. I really wanna fix the sound effects issue. It sucks playing without any sound effects. And I wanna get that part done. So, I will be seeing you guys next stream. Which I might stream tomorrow. But no guarantee. Anyway, bye bye.
