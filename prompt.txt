## Common Questions

These documentaries implicitly or explicitly seek to answer questions such as:

- What was the original concept or spark for the game?
- Who were the key individuals involved, and what were their roles and contributions?
- What were the primary inspirations (games, art, personal experiences)?
- What were the most significant challenges encountered during development (technical, creative, financial, corporate, personal)?
- How did the team or creator(s) overcome these obstacles?
- What was the creative process like for art, music, sound, gameplay, and narrative?
- What tools, technologies, or unique methods were employed?
- How did team dynamics (or solo development realities) influence the project?
- What was the role of publishers, funding platforms (like Kickstarter), or external partners?
- How did playtesting and player feedback shape the final product?
- What was the atmosphere during critical periods like "crunch time" or pre-launch?
- How was the game marketed and launched?
- What was the immediate critical and commercial reception upon release?
- What is the game's lasting impact, legacy, and what did it mean to its creators and players?
- What makes this particular game unique or special in the landscape of video games?

## Information Flow

The information flow is predominantly **chronological**, guiding the audience through the game's lifecycle from its nascent idea to its release and subsequent impact. However, this linear progression is frequently punctuated by **thematic deep dives**. For example, while discussing a particular phase of development, the documentary might pause the chronological narrative to explore the art design philosophy, the composition of the soundtrack, or a specific technical hurdle in more detail.

Many documentaries employ a **"hook-first"** approach, starting with a segment that establishes the game's importance, its cultural impact, or a central intriguing aspect, before rewinding to the beginning of the story. The narrative typically builds towards the climax of the game's release and then moves into a reflective phase covering post-release events, community reception, and the game's legacy. The conclusion often offers final thoughts from the creators, summarizing their journey or the game's significance.

## Unique Elements

While sharing common structures, each documentary often has standout features:

- **LEGO Island:** Its deep dive into the parallel struggling histories of both LEGO and Mindscape provides extensive corporate context, and the narrative arc of creative triumph followed by corporate "betrayal" is particularly dramatic. The focus on Wes Jenkins's pivotal role and tragic end adds a strong emotional core.
- **Hollow Knight:** Emphasizes its game jam origins and the organic evolution of a simple concept into a vast world. The detailing of how specific mechanics, like the Shade, arose from problem-solving is insightful.
- **Untitled Goose Game:** Uniquely focuses on the accidental virality and meme-ification of a game born from a joke, including how its placeholder title became permanent.
- **Undertale:** Offers a profoundly personal perspective from its primary creator, Toby Fox, including his anxieties surrounding unexpected massive success and his distinct game design philosophies.
- **Stardew Valley:** Showcases an extreme example of solo development, detailing Eric Barone's immense dedication, prolonged development cycle, and personal sacrifices. The explicit mention of the game's anti-consumerist themes is also notable.
- **Celeste:** Stands out for its candid and sensitive exploration of mental health, demonstrating how personal struggles were directly woven into the game's narrative and mechanics.
- **The Binding of Isaac:** Is notable for its frank discussion of controversial religious themes, the creator's intent to design a game "to fail," and the long, complex saga of its technical limitations, remakes, and deep integration of community-created (mod) content into official releases.
- **Shovel Knight:** Highlights a team's departure from a larger studio to pursue a shared vision, their commitment to fulfilling extensive Kickstarter promises over many years, and their meticulous approach to emulating (and selectively breaking) NES-era design constraints.

## Content Balance

The documentaries generally strike a balance, but with varying emphasis:

- **Creative Process (High Focus):** The journey of idea generation, game design, level design, art direction, music composition, and narrative development is consistently a primary focus. This is where the "making-of" aspect shines.
- **Personal Stories of Developers (High Focus):** The human element is crucial. The passions, struggles, breakthroughs, and personalities of the creators are central to the narrative, making the stories relatable and engaging. This is particularly prominent in indie-focused documentaries.
- **Technical Details (Medium Focus):** Engine choices, programming challenges, and innovative technical solutions are discussed, typically in an accessible manner. The depth varies; for example, _LEGO Island_'s pioneering 3D work or _The Binding of Isaac_'s Flash limitations receive more attention than the specific coding of _Untitled Goose Game_.
- **Business & Logistical Aspects (Variable Focus):**
  - **Indie Games:** Often detail Kickstarter campaigns, the challenges of self-publishing, marketing on a shoestring budget, and the financial precarity (_Stardew Valley_, _Shovel Knight_).
  - **Larger/Licensed Projects:** May delve more into publisher dynamics, corporate politics, licensing agreements, sales targets, and the higher financial stakes involved (_LEGO Island_).
- **Timeline & Development Milestones (High Focus):** The chronological progression, including key phases, delays, crunch periods, and the road to release, forms the backbone of the narrative.
- **Reception, Legacy & Impact (Medium to High Focus):** The game's critical and player reception, sales figures, and its broader cultural or industry impact are usually covered, especially if significant.

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis, a compelling video game making-of documentary should:

1.  **Tell a Human Story:** Focus on the people behind the game – their passions, struggles, sacrifices, and triumphs. Audiences connect with personal journeys.
2.  **Establish a Strong Narrative Arc:** Even if chronological, identify a core conflict or journey (e.g., underdog success, overcoming impossible odds, creative vision vs. reality).
3.  **Highlight the "Spark":** Clearly explain the initial inspiration and the core concept that drove the game's creation.
4.  **Show, Don't Just Tell, the Creative Process:** Provide insights into how art, music, design, and narrative were developed. Visuals of prototypes, concept art, and early builds are invaluable.
5.  **Address Challenges Transparently:** Don't shy away from the difficulties – technical, financial, creative, or personal. Overcoming adversity makes for a more compelling story.
6.  **Explain Key Design Decisions:** Delve into why certain mechanics, features, or aesthetic choices were made, and how they evolved.
7.  **Incorporate Diverse Voices (if applicable):** If a team effort, try to get perspectives from different disciplines (art, code, design, music, production). For solo devs, their singular voice is key.
8.  **Illustrate Technical Aspects Accessibly:** Explain technical challenges and solutions in a way that a non-technical audience can understand and appreciate.
9.  **Showcase the Game's Uniqueness:** What makes this game special? What did it do differently?
10. **Include the Release and Reception:** Cover the launch, critical response, and player impact to provide closure and context for the game's success or lessons learned.
11. **Discuss the Legacy:** What is the game's lasting impact on players, the creators, or the industry?
12. **Balance Depth with Pacing:** Provide enough detail to be informative but maintain a good narrative pace to keep viewers engaged.
13. **Use Archival Material Effectively:** Early footage, design documents, photos, and developer interviews from the time can add authenticity and richness.
14. **Consider a Unique Angle or Theme:** As seen in the analyzed documentaries, focusing on a specific theme (like mental health in _Celeste_, or corporate conflict in _LEGO Island_) can make the documentary stand out.

By incorporating these elements, a new documentary can effectively capture the complex, challenging, and ultimately rewarding process of creating a video game.

Now, examine all information I have extracted from Kaze's live stream from April 2023 (game 3 years in development) to June 2025:

<dev_streams>
<extracted_information>
*Extracted on: 20230413*

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" has been in development for "almost three years."
- Current development focuses on refining existing areas (e.g., "Chris 1," the first overworld), implementing new features like tutorial systems, and ongoing engine upgrades.
- A significant portion of the stream was dedicated to designing and implementing "tutorial bunnies" to teach players new movement mechanics (dive jump, wall kick/slide, spin jump).
- Work includes visual updates (shading, textures for windmills, mushrooms), addressing bugs (softlocks, old "crusty" textures), and optimizing performance (sine/cosine functions, aiming for 60 FPS on N64).
- The engine upgrades are mostly complete, but the project is still considered a "journey" and not finished, estimated at "like 70 percent maybe."
- Kaze mentions progress on a separate Banjo-Kazooie ROM hack, specifically finishing a boss fight.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a pragmatic and somewhat cynical view of game development: "it always starts like really fun and eventually it turns into pure torture that's just the cycle of making games."
- He is acutely aware of the challenges of ROM hack development, particularly player patience and the lack of initial financial commitment from players: "But for a romhack, you can't really go over your patience budget... So there's no initial commitment from the player."
- Kaze is considering switching his streaming platform from Twitch to YouTube due to frustrations with Twitch's ad policies, stating, "Twitch ads are so terrible. I just quit using Twitch practically."
- He values clarity and accessibility in game design, especially for tutorials: "The tutorials need to be the most understandable way possible."
- Kaze reflects on the high failure rate of major ROM hack projects ("below four percent") and advises starting with smaller projects.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Actively contributes to the game's visual appeal. Kaze states, "Biobank did a lot of revamping to make this look prettier" for the "Chris 1" area.
    - Collaborates on UI and tutorial elements; Kaze delegates the task of creating tutorial billboards to Biobak ("Okay, you know what, Biobank? You get to make the billboards").
    - Provides significant design suggestions, such as using rings for tutorial objectives to ensure players perform the correct move, which Kaze adopts.
- **Zeina (animator):**
    - Responsible for character/object animations. During the stream, Kaze reviews a video of an animation Zeina sent.
    - Kaze provides feedback to Zeina on her animation work, for instance, regarding the rotation point of an animated character ("it looks a little like he's not rotating around his actual middle").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Yoshi Milkman (viewer/community member):** Offered a Mario model for Kaze to review.
    - **Community/Chat:** Provides active feedback and suggestions during the stream. For example, Biobak (likely the same person as the graphics artist) made the key suggestion for tutorial rings via chat.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Tutorial Design:** A major focus, with Kaze iterating on how to best teach new moves. This includes:
    - Deciding on "tutorial bunnies" as the delivery mechanism.
    - Debating the presentation: initially text, then signs due to N64 resolution limits ("The N64 does not have the resolution for pop-up text").
    - Designing visual cues (speech bubbles with button icons and arrows) and iterating on their clarity.
    - Implementing Biobak's suggestion of "rings for players to go through with the specified move to get the coin" to ensure players learn effectively.
    - Animating the bunnies to visually demonstrate the moves, followed by a particle ring objective.
- **N64 Technical Limitations:** Constantly influences design. Examples include texture resolution (64x64 for tutorial prompts, 16 colors for indexed textures), alpha channel limitations, and avoiding performance-heavy elements.
- **Camera Control:** Kaze emphasizes a player-centric camera philosophy: "if you make the camera rotate without the player being able to predict it, you're always gonna have to play a whole direction that they don't intend... That's why we never actually have the camera do anything without the player somehow forcing that." He struggles with forcing the camera perspective during tutorial cutscenes.
- **Movement System:** The game features an enhanced movement system, which Kaze claims is "even better than the one in Peach's Fury." Tutorials are crucial for teaching these advanced mechanics.
- **Level Design (Chris 1):** This area is being refined to be a "nice first course," with adjustments made to make jumps easier and to integrate the new tutorials.
- **Mario's Lighting:** Kaze acknowledges Mario's model appears "a bit too dark" and considers solutions like making the light brighter on him.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Plan:** Kaze states, "It [his work] will be open source once it releases."
- **Streaming Platform Choice:** Kaze is actively testing YouTube as an alternative to Twitch for his development streams, primarily due to Twitch's ad policies. This decision has implications for audience reach and streamer monetization.
- **Monetization:** While not directly funding the ROM hack, Kaze mentions, "Losing monetization on Twitch is going to be devastating," indicating streaming income is important to him. A viewer also donated during the YouTube stream.
- **Community Engagement:** The stream itself serves as a form of marketing and community building, allowing direct interaction with potential players and gathering feedback.

## Key Quotes
- "I've been programming this for almost three years now... although like all the engine upgrades are done now mostly we're still upgrading it it's a journey you can't just call it finished now." (Provides context on project length and iterative nature)
- "But for a romhack, you can't really go over your patience budget. That's why I really want to make sure that everything is as concise as possible. Because with the romhack you have the disadvantage that no one paid for your game. So there's no initial commitment from the player." (Highlights Kaze's understanding of ROM hack development challenges and player expectations)
- "Okay, maybe we do have to go with the suggestion that Biomech made. So, let's make rings for players to go through with the specified move to get the coin." (Demonstrates collaborative design and iteration in solving tutorial challenges)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The philosophy behind the enhanced movement system in "Return to Yoshi's Island" and how Kaze balanced innovation with the feel of a Mario 64 game.
- The decision-making process for tutorial design: challenges in teaching complex moves on the N64 and the evolution from simple text to interactive rings.
- Kaze's experience managing a long-term, complex ROM hack project largely as a solo developer with key collaborators: motivations, dealing with burnout ("starts like really fun and eventually it turns into pure torture"), and the role of the community.
- The impact of the Mario 64 decompilation project on the development of "Return to Yoshi's Island" and the technical freedoms or constraints it presented.
- Kaze's vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island" upon release and his reasons for choosing to make it open source.

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is in active development, with a current focus on a complex Bowser boss fight, including his AI, movement mechanics (walk cycle, step-up physics), and interaction with Mario (tail grab).
- The game has evolved significantly from its demo version, with Kaze stating, "the actual final game is so unrecognizable from the demo right now it's actually crazy."
- Continuous engine optimization is a major part of the process. Kaze is constantly finding and implementing new optimizations, such as improved sine/cosine functions and fixes for fundamental SM64 engine bugs like "floor clacking."
- Development involves integrating assets from collaborators, debugging interactions (e.g., Mario's grab, object interaction boxes), and refining existing elements (e.g., ResNor model, tutorial signs).
- RTYI is the primary focus, with potential plans to release its optimizations for base SM64 at a later date. The goal is for RTYI to run at 60 FPS.
- Bug fixing is an ongoing, iterative process, often involving live debugging during streams and checking code history (e.g., via GitHub desktop).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong confidence in his coding abilities, humorously stating, "I literally was just born with the ability to code." He distinguishes between coding skill (innate understanding) and coding knowledge (learned).
- He holds firm game design philosophies, notably a strong dislike for excessive player options: "I hate options. I think games should give you as few options as possible... More options, more confusion." He believes fewer options lead to a more consistent and curated player experience.
- Kaze believes his ROM hacking activities are "perfectly legal" and that Nintendo "literally cannot ban me from doing this."
- He is driven by a desire to create a highly polished and technically proficient game, evident in his deep dives into engine optimization.
- He is open about his personal background, mentioning he started programming at age 12 and currently works as a kitchen cook, though he is also a professional Unreal Engine developer.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Badub's specific contributions to RTYI.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Provides 3D models for the game.
    - Mentioned as having sent a model for "tutorial bunnies" that Kaze was integrating.
    - Contributed to the new Bowser model, providing updated geometry and textures. Kaze worked on tweaking/integrating this model.
- **Zeina (Animator / Kaze's wife):**
    - Responsible for animations and artwork for RTYI. She mentions, "Zaina's job here is animations and artwork."
    - Created an animation for "Bowser getting hit" and is working on a "Bowser's showcase."
    - Is developing a "new animation format" for Mario, which Kaze notes will require significant integration work.
    - Actively participates in the stream chat and sometimes speaks on mic.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **EasyAsPi** (Discord user): Credited with the idea of using imaginary numbers for a sine/cosine function optimization, making it "twice as fast."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boss Mechanics:** A significant challenge is programming Bowser's boss fight, including his movement AI (getting him beyond a "Roomba" state), step-up physics for navigating terrain, and the tail-grab mechanic. The fight is intended to have multiple phases.
- **Engine Limitations & Optimizations:** Overcoming SM64 engine limitations is a recurring theme. A major challenge was "floor clacking" (or "surface cocking"), a bug in SM64's collision detection, which Kaze addressed with a custom optimization that involves sorting surfaces and iterating minimal data.
- **Player Experience & Options:** A core design decision is to limit player options to create a focused and consistent experience. Kaze argues, "a bunch of options are just unnecessarily confusing and people aren't going to have all the same experience, which I don't like."
- **Movement System:** Emphasis on "sick movement" for Mario, including new abilities like long jumping out of a long jump landing and jumping out of a triple jump landing.
- **Visuals and Performance:** Addressing visual issues like pop-in for distant background elements (e.g., Yoshi ships) while maintaining performance is an ongoing task. Kaze experimented with scaling objects in to reduce jarring pop-in.
- **Asset Integration:** Integrating new models and animations (e.g., tutorial bunnies, updated ResNor, Bowser model) and ensuring they function correctly with existing physics and rendering systems presents regular challenges (e.g., lighting issues, object physics).

## Business Aspects
- **Release Strategy & IP Concerns:** Kaze plans to "delay open sourcing the game a little from the initial release, just so Nintendo doesn't instantly take it down." He suggests a delay of "maybe like two months," also to hide Easter eggs.
- **Monetization/Funding:** Kaze relies on community support for his work. He mentions, "My youtube learns like a slight bits my patron is like the biggest income."
- **Platform Choice (Streaming):** The decision to switch from Twitch to YouTube for streaming was partly financial. Kaze noted, "Twitch actually only gives you a 50-50 card, which sucks. I think YouTube is 70-30. It's another good reason to switch to YouTube."

## Key Quotes
- "the actual final game is so unrecognizable from the demo right now it's actually crazy" - Kaze, on the game's evolution.
- "So since we need to fix floor clacking like this... I had the idea, what if we just keep the sorting priority, and we kill all the floors that are too high, and then we can just only iterate 0x10 bytes of each floor?" - Kaze, detailing a significant technical optimization.
- "I hate options. I think games should give you as few options as possible... a bunch of options are just unnecessarily confusing and people aren't going to have all the same experience, which I don't like." - Kaze, on his game design philosophy.

## Potential Interview Topics
- The specific technical breakthroughs in RTYI (like the floor collision fix) and how they push the boundaries of what's possible in an SM64 ROM hack.
- Kaze's design philosophy regarding player choice and curated experiences, and how it manifests in RTYI's level and game design.
- The collaborative dynamic between Kaze, Zaina, and Biobak, exploring how their individual contributions shape the final game and the process of integrating diverse assets.
- Kaze's long-term vision for RTYI, its place within the SM64 modding community, and his thoughts on the future of large-scale fan projects.
- Navigating the creative and technical challenges of building a full-scale game on a heavily modified, existing engine, particularly the balance between preserving the SM64 feel and introducing new mechanics.

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is planned to have 15 courses in total.
- Development is currently focused on Overworld 3, starting with Course 11, "Bowser's Frantic Fleet Factory."
- The Bowser fight logic is "basically finished" and awaiting animations from Zeina, as well as SFX and VFX implementation.
- Once the Bowser fight assets are integrated, the first two overworlds will be considered complete.
- Kaze is actively brainstorming and finalizing ideas for the remaining 5 main courses and 2 side levels.
- There's a specific plan to include 15 "retro levels" (pipes leading to sections themed after older games) throughout the game.
- Kaze demonstrated the game running well on N64 hardware, highlighting good performance even in widescreen mode.
- The stream itself is part of the development process, used for brainstorming level themes and mechanics with community input.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar emphasizes the importance of strong decision-making in game development: "Making decisions is like the most important thing of making a game... if you don't make good decisions, your game's gonna be shit."
- He believes in generating a surplus of ideas to choose from: "You should come up with 15 ideas and use 5 of them... We need more ideas so we can pick the higher quality ones."
- Kaze is conscious of not repeating ideas from his previous ROM hacks like "Lost Impact" or concepts already well-executed in other notable hacks like "Star Road," aiming for originality or a fresh take.
- He has strong opinions on level themes, disliking water levels and "boring" concepts like museums, and preferring complex but understandable game mechanics.
- He expresses a desire to make games for the joy of creation and for people to play freely: "I don't want people do have to pay or watch ads for games. I just want to make good games."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (referred to as "Badoo"):** The composer for the game. Kaze mentions that organizing the planned "Music Level" with Badub will require effort but should work.
- **Biobak:** A graphics artist. Kaze mentions Biobak could potentially model a complex retro-futuristic level but is hesitant to ask for "200 hours of unpaid labor."
- **Zeina (referred to as "Zeno" and "Xena"):** The animator. Kaze is waiting for Zeina's animations for the Bowser fight before he can implement the final SFX and VFX for it. Her work is a key dependency for completing parts of Overworld 2.
- **Other Contributors:** No other specific, active contributors to "Return to Yoshi's Island" were explicitly named with defined roles in this transcript. Kaze mentions other modders ("Scallops") in the context of their past work.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Main Challenge:** Generating enough high-quality, original course ideas for the 5 remaining main level slots. Kaze wants more ideas than needed to ensure quality.
- **Iterative Design:** Kaze actively brainstorms, discusses, and refines level ideas during the stream, taking chat suggestions into account. He discarded several initial ideas and developed new ones.
- **Key Course Concepts Solidified:**
    - **Bowser's Frantic Fleet Factory (Course 11):** An airship factory where Mario sabotages operations. Detailed mission structure and environment ideas are laid out.
    - **Wild West Valley:** Yoshi Valley (from Mario Kart 64) themed as a Wild West level where Mario acts as a detective catching outlaws (Snuffits, Shy Guys).
    - **Superhero Comic Book World:** Mario as a superhero in a grim city, potentially with a "dark world" mechanic involving lower gravity in a Raven-controlled haunted version.
    - **Music Level:** Initially hesitant due to "Star Road," but reconsidered with new ideas, possibly involving Mario Paint aesthetics.
    - **Casino Level:** A theme Kaze enjoys and wants to do well, despite a previous iteration in "Lost Impact." Potentially oversized.
- **World-Switching Mechanic:** Kaze is keen on a level with a mechanic similar to Tiny-Huge Island, where players switch between two versions of the same world (e.g., normal/haunted, potentially using mirrors as a transition). This idea was explored for a medieval castle and then adapted for the superhero comic book level.
- **Retro Level Integration:** A significant design element involves creating 15 retro pipes leading to sections inspired by older games. The stream involved assigning specific games (e.g., Smash 64, Mario Land 1, Paper Mario, Yoshi's Story, Dr. Mario, Mario Paint) to the planned main courses.
- **Avoiding Repetition:** A recurring concern is to avoid themes or mechanics already heavily featured in his own past works or other popular ROM hacks unless he can offer a significantly fresh take.
- **Technical Considerations:** Brief discussion on frame pacing and NTSC-only development. Kaze is confident in the game's performance on N64.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization Stance:** Kaze explicitly states he does not want to make players pay or watch ads for his games. He rejected the idea of a "Paypal level."
- **Streaming Platform Choice:** Kaze has switched from Twitch to YouTube for streaming, citing Twitch's revenue split ("they kind of like taken over 50% cut") and ad policies as reasons.
- **Marketing/Distribution:** No specific plans for marketing or formal release were discussed, beyond Kaze's general aim to make good games that many people play, suggesting ROM hacking is a better avenue for reach than indie games without strong marketing.

## Key Quotes

## Game Development Process
- The stream focuses on the initial art style and visual theme definition for a new level, "Frantic Fleet Factory" (internally "Chris XI").
- Kaze starts with sketches and a basic layout idea, then iteratively experiments with textures, color schemes, and environmental elements (lava vs. oil).
- The process involves referencing other games (e.g., Mario Sunshine's Rico Harbor, Skyward Sword, Metal Harbor) for inspiration.
- Key development stages shown: conceptualization, visual prototyping in Blender, in-game testing, and refinement of effects and assets.
- There's a clear priority on establishing the level's aesthetic ("look and feel") before detailed construction begins.
- Kaze mentions the game will have 15 courses, and this level is Course 11.
- Discussion of a "zoo level" previously worked on, highlighting iterative learning about visual aspects like saturation.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze finds starting a level (defining its initial look and feel) to be the "most interesting but also the hardest part."
- He describes a common creative cycle: initial frustration where ideas seem like "dogshit," followed by a breakthrough moment where it feels like "the best thing ever."
- He expresses a strong opinion that finishing a major SM64 ROM hack requires immense dedication, jokingly stating one needs to be "mentally ill" to undertake such a project for free.
- Kaze values conciseness in communication.
- He openly admits to using "clickbait" titles for his YouTube videos for engagement.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: Not directly named in this transcript as the composer for "Return to Yoshi's Island." However, Kaze discusses desired musical themes for the level ("evil, bowser, construction") and mentions standards for music contributions, implying collaboration with a composer.
- Biobak: Actively contributes to visual design. Kaze takes Biobak's suggestions seriously, such as trying "black water with orange highlights" for the oil, and credits him with helping with "level layouts" or "level visuals."
- Zeina: Mentioned personally (writing wedding thank you cards, made pizza). Her role as an animator for the project is not detailed in this specific transcript, though implied by her known involvement in Kaze's projects.
- Other Contributors:
    - **Chat:** The livestream chat provides real-time feedback and suggestions, some of which Kaze considers or implements (e.g., ideas for the oil effect, color schemes).
    - **"Many, many people"**: Credited generally for "text just..." which likely refers to existing ripped assets or community tools used.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Theme Evolution:** The level concept shifts significantly from a construction zone on a volcano with lava to an offshore oil rig with a sea of oil. This change was driven by a desire for more color and a less "boring" or "monocolored" aesthetic.
- **Visual Effects for Oil:** A significant portion of the stream is dedicated to creating a dynamic, rainbow-reflective oil slick effect, involving complex shader work and iteration to get the look right (e.g., "clown vomit water" at one point).
- **Color Palette:** Extensive discussion and experimentation with color schemes to make the level visually appealing and distinct, moving from desaturated volcano colors to considerations of purple-orange-blue, and finally settling on a purple/yellow theme for platforms over dark oil.
- **Technical Limitations (N64):** Constant awareness of N64 hardware constraints, particularly polygon counts ("We might have to rethink the way that the elements are in this level... without making it so many polygons that's gonna lag on the n64"), draw distance, and texture memory. This impacts level structure and asset design.
- **Platform Design:** 고민 on how to design the main platforms, referencing Rico Harbor and Metal Harbor, and focusing on creating modular, visually interesting platform assets in Blender.
- **Level Layout and Structure:** Initial idea of a Rico Harbor-like layout. Later, with the oil rig theme, discussion of distinct areas, a "power generator building," and potentially using pipes to transition between sections to manage complexity and performance. The idea of an "extremely vertical area" is mentioned.
- **Enemy Integration:** Consideration of adding "looking bullies" as enemies that would fit the construction/industrial theme.
- **Yoshi Coin Placement:** Brief discussion on the planned locations for Yoshi Coins within the level, tied to mission objectives and specific areas like "Bowser's office" and "sewers."
- **Narrative Context:** The level is where Bowser builds his airships, and the player arrives after destroying his fleet in a previous Bowser level, adding a story connection.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization:** Kaze mentions a viewer's donation and his own failure to properly set up a donation system. He explicitly states he doesn't think he can sell the ROM hack ("I don't think I can [release it on a shop]").
- **Marketing/Promotion:** Kaze is creating YouTube content, such as a video titled "Mario64's movement is not perfect," which he calls "good clickbait." This serves as a form of community engagement and indirect promotion for his work.
- **No plans for commercial release:** The nature of it being a ROM hack using Nintendo's IP prevents commercialization.

## Key Quotes
- "So I always find this to be the most interesting but also the hardest part of making a level and that is getting the start." (Reflecting on the creative process)
- "See, that's always how it goes. You start making a level and you feel like, wow, this is dogshit, this is garbage, this is not working out at all. And then you get a few ideas and suddenly it's like, ah, shit, this is gonna be the best thing ever." (Describing the emotional arc of level design)
- "Today stream is dedicated to making sure that the level can look good. That's always our first priority before we start making the level. We decide something where platforming can be then we look how we can theme this in a way that looks good with nice colors." (Highlighting the design philosophy for level creation)
- "Basically, this is going to be where Bowser builds all his airships. And this is especially funny, because this is course 11. And in the second Bowser level, which is the level right before this, you destroy his entire fleet, right? So now you go back to where the ships were actually built." (Explaining the level's narrative context)

## Game Development Process
- Currently working on "Course 11" of "Return to Yoshi's Island 64," with a newly decided "oil rig" theme, replacing a previous "volcano" concept.
- The game is planned to have approximately 15 courses.
- Kaze is in the process of designing the layout and specific missions for Course 11, including a multi-stage narrative involving Bowser's minions, a strike, crane operation, and destroying a Bowser statue.
- Earlier levels, like "Course 1," are being revisited and tweaked for better design and verticality.
- The general workflow involves creating assets, experimenting with their combination, building out the level, and then refining. Course 11 is currently in the "shaping up" phase.
- End cutscene animations by Zeina are a dependency, and their completion is noted ("They took a while," implying they might be done or close).
- The next planned level after Course 11 is a "Wild West course."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prefers to focus intently when playing games, which is why he usually doesn't play them on stream.
- He believes game design is fundamentally about solving problems, not just generating random ideas: "Designing something is not just about coming up with ideas it's about solving whatever problem you have in design."
- Kaze expresses a desire for games to offer genuine freedom and laments experiences where gameplay feels like following a pre-determined script: "That's not the freedom I want games to give me, you know."
- He acknowledges the difficulty of early-stage level design: "This level feels like it's starting really rough yeah yeah that's always how it goes."
- He finds inspiration can come unexpectedly: "Sometimes you just wake up and there's like random thoughts in your brain during your sleep and you just have a great idea."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (Composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** No relevant information found in this transcript (Kaze appears to be doing much of the 3D modeling and texture work himself in this stream).
-   **Zeina (Animations):**
    -   Provided animations for the game's end cutscene. Kaze mentions, "I still also need to do the end cutscene, but I was waiting for the animations for Zena first. They took a while."
    -   Kaze also mentions a personal interaction: "Me and Zeyna, we went out and we made a cool... We made a terrarium in a closed jar."
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Rionu:** Will be handling the multi-language translation for the game. Kaze mentions, "Multi-language support is possible... because there's this really annoying guy called Rionu... he says he's going to translate that."
    -   **Nata:** Provided a texture Kaze uses: "nata sent me this texture a while ago."
    -   **Leela (Chat user/bot):** Provides real-time feedback and inspiration. Kaze notes, "Oh, right, Leela, you're coming to make me realize I want to change something about Curse 1." and later "Thank you lila" after Leela posts a mountain image that Kaze finds inspiring.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Theme Change for Course 11:** Switched from a volcano theme to an "oil rig" theme, requiring new platform ideas. The current working name for this level is "Frantic Fleet Factory."
-   **Platform Design:** Struggling to design large, wide platforms for the oil rig that are visually interesting and not just "big cement blocks." This includes designing a blimp landing pad.
-   **Level Naming Conventions:** Levels are named using alliterations, rhymes, or other memorable stylistic devices (e.g., "Bunny Brushwoods," "All Alone Bubble Dome," "Ghoul Guy Galleon," "Frantic Fleet Factory").
-   **Course 1 Redesign:** Adding more verticality to the first star of Course 1, potentially using a tree/mushroom and repositioning a windmill for a more engaging path.
-   **Mission Structure for Course 11:** Detailed planning for a 6-mission structure:
    1.  Mess with workers.
    2.  Workers strike; player operates a crane to break a Bowser statue.
    3.  Crane climb mission.
    4.  Power generator mission.
    5.  Blimp pad mission.
    6.  Underwater 8-bit pipe.
-   **Visual Design of Course 11:** Experimenting with "ocean spires" or large rock formations inspired by various Mario games (New Super Mario Bros., Mario World) to create verticality and define spaces, integrated with oil rig structures.
-   **Technical Limitations:** Constantly aware of N64 hardware constraints, such as polygon counts ("This level is going to absolutely murder the triangles") and texture memory, influencing design choices.
-   **Player Navigation:** Acknowledges the challenge of making surfaces clearly standable/non-standable, especially on complex geometry like the proposed spires.
-   **Platforming Mechanics for Course 11:** Brainstorming includes moving platforms, trains, platforms on hooks, seesaw platforms, shipping containers, zip lines, and cannons.

## Business Aspects
-   **Game Name Searchability:** Considers "Return to Yoshi's Island 64" might not be the most searchable name, indicating an awareness of discoverability.
-   **Marketing/Release Timing:** Comments on another ROM hack's release timing near a major Nintendo release ("Breath of the Wild") as "dangerous marketing wise."
-   **Legal Risks:** Acknowledges Nintendo's history of taking action against ROM hacks after their own game releases, referring to releasing a hack at such a time as a "ballsy move."
-   No direct mentions of funding or specific distribution plans beyond the typical ROM hack release model.

## Key Quotes
-   "My heck is okay the name is weird i'm planning to call it return to yoshi's island 64 that's the current name but like it might not be the most searchable name so..."
-   "So this is actually going to be a bit difficult because now that we switch to the oil rig theming we need some new platform ideas."
-   "Designing something is not just about coming up with ideas it's about solving whatever problem you have in design."
-   "This level feels like it's starting really rough yeah yeah that's always how it goes let's see how this looks with a good rock texture."
-   "I feel like there are so many video games where there is no solution right off the bat... That's not the freedom I want games to give me, you know."

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is a ROM hack based on the Mario 64 decompilation.
- Kaze is currently working on "Course 11," an oil rig themed level, focusing on creating assets (platforms, cranes, etc.) and implementing their mechanics.
- The project is described as being in the "end game now," with Course 11 being one of the later levels.
- Development involves a cycle of asset creation, mechanic implementation, level design, testing (often live on stream and on N64 hardware), and significant debugging.
- Kaze is also working on optimizing the game, including making his own "optimized libultra" and backporting optimizations.
- Progress can be incremental and sometimes slow, with dependencies like animations for a boss fight ("buzzer boss fight") causing delays.
- Future planned levels include a comic book world, a wild west valley, and a casino world.
- There's consideration for a retro pipe stage in Course 11, potentially based on "Smash 64 board to platforms."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar has a strong design philosophy, preferring to curate the player experience rather than offering many options for fundamental mechanics: "I'm kind of against giving players options. I think it's weird to give the player an option to like select how the fundamental thing like that works."
- He values player freedom and discovery: "I think games should be about experiencing freedom... I wanna make the decision myself. I don't want the dev telling me, hey, do this, please."
- Kaze admits to a development habit of not always thoroughly testing code immediately to save time, which sometimes leads to bugs appearing later: "See that's the thing with me. I never test my code. I just assume it works... And sometimes, months later, a bug just occurs."
- He draws inspiration from other games, notably *Super Mario Sunshine* (Rico Harbor for Course 11's visual style) and *Super Mario Odyssey* (for lighting improvements).
- He expresses frustration with ads on Twitch, which was a primary reason for moving his streams to YouTube.
- Kaze demonstrates a willingness to iterate on design elements, such as level colors and fog, until he is satisfied with the aesthetic and feel.

## Collaborator Information
- Badoop: The composer for the game's Original Sound Track (OST). Kaze states, "All of the OST is custom made by Badoop. So, it actually is not copyrighted. Well, actually, there are some remixes of Mario songs."
- Biobak: There is no direct mention of "Biobak" with this specific spelling in the transcript. A "Biomek" is mentioned once: "The red makes it look like running red ash. That was Biomek's idea." This was a color suggestion for a graphical element (barrels on the oil rig). This might be the graphics artist referred to, or another contributor.
- Zeina (also referred to as Zayna/Xena in transcript, likely Kaze's wife/partner present during the stream): Works on animations for the game. She is shown working on Bowser's walk cycle during the stream. Kaze discusses animation details with her, such as head movement related to Bowser looking at Mario. Her animation work is important for progressing elements like boss fights.
- Other Contributors:
    - Lila: Appears to be a collaborator working on animation tools or the exporter. Kaze asks her about "quaternion animations" and mentions "stuff in the exporter."
    - Nata: Credited with making the "HD Worms Fortress" textures, which Kaze then fixed up.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Lighting System:** A significant change involved adding light coming from the camera, inspired by *Mario Odyssey*, to make the game look brighter and improve readability of Mario, especially in dark areas.
- **UI Design:** The breath meter for swimming was intentionally placed in the middle of the screen, above Mario, to ensure players notice it, as opposed to a less central UI position.
- **Player Guidance vs. Freedom:** Kaze is hesitant to add features like trajectory lines for cannons if they remove skill or the "sense of freedom," preferring players to discover and master mechanics.
- **Aesthetics and Atmosphere:** Significant time is spent on visual elements like fog (color, density) and the color palette of levels (e.g., the oil rig level's colors were iterated upon to avoid looking like lava and to achieve a more "rich" feel).
- **Bug Fixing and Technical Issues:** Recurring challenges include debugging game mechanics (e.g., broken ziplines, cannon reticle issues), addressing collision problems, and fixing visual glitches on N64 hardware related to changes like "clip ratio" adjustments. Kaze often debugs these live.
- **N64 Hardware Limitations:** Development includes testing on actual N64 hardware, leading to discoveries of performance issues (FPS drops) and graphical anomalies that need to be addressed.
- **Asset and Mechanic Design:** The stream shows the process of designing and implementing various platforming mechanics for Course 11, such as moving platforms, rotating cranes, and seesaws, including deciding against some ideas like "piles of dirt" on an oil rig.

## Business Aspects
- **Streaming Platform Choice:** Kaze explicitly states he switched from Twitch to YouTube for streaming due to Twitch's ad policy: "The reason I don't want to stream on Twitch anymore is that I find it personally unwatchable with all the ads."
- **Audience Engagement:** Kaze demonstrates awareness of YouTube algorithms and engagement tactics, such as intentionally including "mistakes" in his videos to encourage comments. ("I just said 37, because I thought someone would notice and comment on that for the algorithm.")
- **Release Timeline:** Kaze indicates the game will not be released "this year" (referring to the stream's context), as he wants to release it "when it's actually completely finished" and acknowledges he doesn't have unlimited time to work on it.
- **Monetization:** While not a commercial product, Kaze has YouTube channel memberships (a viewer becomes a member during the stream). There is no mention of direct funding for the game's development itself.

## Key Quotes
- "See, I'm kind of against giving players options. I think it's weird to give the player an option to like select how the fundamental thing like that works." (Reflects Kaze's design philosophy)
- "Basically, I added the light coming from the camera back... which makes the whole game look a lot brighter. Because I noticed the game is looking pretty dark." (Highlights a significant technical and design change)
- "So man it feels crazy that we're already in quest 11. We're actually just in the end game now for the mod." (Indicates project progress and Kaze's perspective on it)
- "See that's the thing with me. I never test my code. I just assume it works. And it saves me a lot of time. And usually it does. And sometimes, months later, a bug just occurs and it's like, yeah, now I have to prove that I didn't mess up." (Reveals his development approach)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore Kaze's overarching vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island" and how it differentiates itself from other SM64 ROM hacks or his previous projects.

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is approximately two-thirds complete after nearly three years of development.
- The project is currently in a "polishing phase" for older areas while new content, like the "Oil Rig" level, is actively being designed and implemented.
- Major engine changes have largely been completed.
- Kaze anticipates at least another year and a half of development, partly due to his full-time job.
- Development includes creating new levels, designing boss fights (e.g., the Oil Blarg), implementing NPC behaviors (e.g., Buzzy Beetles), and refining existing mechanics like camera and fog.
- A secret "Magic Show" Easter egg level is planned but not yet started.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong opinions on game design, critiquing games like Pikmin 2 for lacking player freedom while praising Tears of the Kingdom for its emergent gameplay.
- He is committed to open-sourcing the game *after* its release, partly to avoid leaking the mod and partly due to concerns about Nintendo.
- Kaze shows a resilient and somewhat defiant attitude towards Nintendo's past takedown attempts, stating he's "not really that worried about Nintendo anymore."
- He emphasizes the importance of player experience, often discussing how to make levels feel substantial and mechanics intuitive.
- Kaze values sticking to core Mario gameplay mechanics while innovating, wishing to avoid custom coding that might detract from the Mario feel.
- He openly discusses the challenges of development, including self-doubt about level design ("the overworld feels so small to me now") and the long timeline.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Significantly contributes to the visual polish of the game. Kaze states Biobak "makes it a lot prettier" by looking over and refining models Kaze creates.
    - Contributes design ideas, such as putting horns on Bowser's office building.
    - Kaze jokingly blames Biobak for a minor issue ("I blame bio back there we go"), indicating a friendly working relationship.
- **Zeina (Animations):**
    - Handles character animations. In the transcript, she asks Kaze if more Bowser animations are needed before she moves on to NPCs.
    - Kaze praises her work: "The animation is done very nicely."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lila (Kaze's wife):** Present during the stream, offers opinions, and Kaze mentions she "usually she's a loudmouth" and "I'm usually just helping him doing stuff." Provides general support.
    - **Chat/Viewers:** Actively provide suggestions for level names, boss ideas, and design solutions, which Kaze engages with and sometimes incorporates.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Design (Oil Rig):**
    - Initial concern that the level might feel too small and linear.
    - Solution involved incorporating an "underwater area" (below sea level, viewed through windows) accessible from multiple points to act as a connector and quick travel system, making the overall level feel larger.
    - Designing Bowser's office: iterated from a full castle concept to a tall, secluded tower for performance and thematic reasons.
- **Boss Design (Oil Rig Boss - "Oil Blarg"):**
    - Goal: A "big, fat, burly guy" to act as a strike breaker, preferably from Yoshi's Island.
    - Concept: An oil-based version of a Blargg from Yoshi's Island.
    - Mechanics: The boss swallows platforms. The player fights it using "soap bars" (possibly delivered by a Paratroopa or found in the arena) to "clean" and shrink the boss. The fight involves chasing the boss with soap, and the boss runs away when the player has soap.
    - Arena: Initially considered an underground area with grates for the Blarg to move through, then shifted to the Blarg eating Mario and spitting him out into a separate boss arena.
- **Gameplay Mechanics & Philosophy:**
    - Decision to keep player control focused on Mario's moveset, avoiding over-reliance on custom mechanics like controlling a crane for a boss fight.
    - Cannon camera and reticle needed a remake due to being "atrocious" and broken by other updates.
    - Improving fog and lighting for better visual appeal.
- **Performance:**
    - Conscious of triangle counts and rendering load, leading to design choices like "secluded areas" for complex structures like Bowser's office.
- **Retro Areas:**
    - Decision to remake some older retro areas because they were smaller and less detailed than newer ones.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Timeline:** Estimated to be at least another year and a half away.
- **Distribution:** The game will be released as open source, but only after the full game is out to prevent leaks and potential issues with Nintendo.
- **Monetization:** Kaze makes money from YouTube ad revenue. He mentions having had a Patreon in the past.
- **Nintendo Relations:** Kaze has a history of Nintendo takedowns but seems to have found a way to continue his work, contesting YouTube claims successfully. He acknowledges the risk but is not overly deterred.

## Key Quotes
- "I've decided we're gonna do a little polishing face on return to Yoshi's Island where we're just gonna polish up a bunch of old things..." (Indicates development stage and iterative process)
- "I want the player to control Mario and not a crane? It's kind of one risk when you make a game like this because we have so many options it's very tempting to You know use our custom coding instead of the Mario moveset and I think that often leads to poor romex So I want to avoid that." (Highlights game design philosophy)
- "This is gonna be open source, of course. I Will open sources once it is released but not before because I would just be leaking my entire mod... Also for you know Nintendo Because if you release the source codes, I feel like you can have a lot more trouble with Nintendo..." (Explains release strategy and concerns)

- "My motto, my mantra is that if the compiler doesn't see a difference, I also don't see a difference. So code style is just not a thing for me." (Reveals Kaze's pragmatic development philosophy)
- "So most likely what's going to happen is that there's going to be coins you collect and you store them globally, right? And then in the store, you'll be able to buy different stuff... There will be the option to donate to characters in the overworld so that you can make the overworld progress. You can see the overworld change while you play, which I think would be really cool." (Details innovative overworld mechanics)

- **Iteration & Testing:** Playtesting has occurred (e.g., "I had a playtest happen on Course 2 in Return to Yoshi's Island. We've made some changes there."). Features are tested on N64 hardware to ensure compatibility and performance.
- **Side Projects:** Kaze is also working on a large level for a competition ("Only Up 64"), which showcases his continued engagement with pushing SM64 limits.
- **Engine Improvements:** Significant work has been done on improving the game's collision system ("You see how stable that is? Mario 64 would never be able to handle this.").

## Personal Insights
- **Motivation:** "My streams here and they are like all about the game if you get entertained that's a side effect I just care about making a good game." Kaze is primarily driven by the desire to create a high-quality game.
- **Self-Awareness:** "I am not a good enough animator to do that They would look worse if I did that" (regarding redoing Mario's base animations). He understands his skill limitations and focuses where he can make the most impact.
- **Creative Freedom:** "I mean the cool thing about my case clips channel here Is that I can just upload whatever the fuck I want and I don't really care if that fucks my algorithm or not I just do what I want and I like that." He values the freedom to work on and stream what he wants without algorithmic pressure.
- **Work Ethic:** Kaze is shown to be very busy, juggling game development with other commitments like a "presentation do it for like a tech conference."
- **Frustrations:** Expresses frustration with software (Blender removing features, YouTube stream delay) and technical challenges (compiler issues).

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):**
    - Intended to create a song for an enemy/character: "I thought Badoop was gonna make him song but Badoop's been missing in attendance for a bit so I'm not really sure what to expect there."
    - Kaze hopes Badoop will also do sound design: "Please let Badoob do sound design as well, please. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Sound design is gonna happen at the end."
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Mentioned in chat interaction: "Oh shit, that's Actually, is that sad or neat biobank? It's neat for me sad for you." (Specific contribution in this stream not detailed but implies ongoing collaboration).
    - Kaze refers to Biobank's understanding of development humor: "Yep, Biobank understands the assignment."
- **Zeina (Animations):**
    - Has provided animations for characters: "Zena made the animations for this guy already or most of them" (referring to the "cement pit guy").
    - Her work is needed for other characters as well: "The glass curry still need the animations."
    - Was unavailable during the stream: "Unfortunately, Zeyna is out with friends today, so you don't get to see her."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - No other direct, named contributors for "Return to Yoshi's Island" were explicitly detailed in this transcript as providing assets or code. "EZSpy" is mentioned as someone who might understand a compiler issue, suggesting a knowledgeable community contact.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Enemy Design:** Detailed planning for interactive enemy setups, such as the "seesaw guy" where breaking a box causes the seesaw to fall and affect a Goomba. Designing the Whomp as a construction worker.
- **Level Design Philosophy:** Prefers separate worlds with an interconnected overworld to avoid excessive backtracking, contrasting with *Banjo-Tooie*'s approach: "Having it the way Banjo-Tooie did it means you add a lot of backtracking and I don't like that."
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - **N64 Performance:** A major focus is ensuring levels run well on actual N64 hardware. This involves managing polygon counts ("13,000!"), draw distance, and exploring optimizations like backface culling. "Dude it's so unplayable with this input lag, I feel like a toddler" (when testing on N64 via stream setup).
    - **Collision:** Ongoing work to improve collision stability ("You guys probably can't really tell the difference but it's very noticeable when you're walking into ceilings like this it's a lot more stable now").
    - **Compiler Issues:** Encountered a significant compiler bug causing a division-by-zero on N64 due to instruction pipelining: "Basically, the compiler decided that right here, where I want to avoid the division by 0. It is going to pipeline the division into the delay slot of my branch."
- **Visuals & Assets:** Designing new assets like Tox Boxes and the "glass star," and considering how they look and function. "I Did I wish I was born like 10 years later so I could become one of those tick-tock livestream us I Okay, okay I am They are really stupid And I don't know why people watch them But the fact they are around like at all is amazing to me I Got them finding a texture is difficult."
- **Lore/World Building:** The game's setting was initially "Bozo's Fleet Factory" but has evolved: "it slowly became just like the place where they tank up, I guess."

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization & Funding:**
    - YouTube channel is "barely profitable, especially now that brilliant doesn't sponsor me anymore kind of back to square zero."
    - Mentions donations and song requests via donations are enabled.
- **Release Plans:**
    - No fixed release date: "Is the release date for your amazing games nope, just wait It's hard to predict when the release is gonna be."
- **Streaming Strategy:**
    - Streams on "Kaze Clips" channel (smaller sub count) rather than his main channel: "I don't want to stream on the main channel because this is not really the content that fits it I don't want to ruin my algorithm, you know." This is to target a dedicated audience interested in the game's development.
- **Marketing/Showcasing:** Mentions F3 (a game showcase event) but states his own mods are not shown there.

## Key Quotes
- "My streams here and they are like all about the game if you get entertained that's a side effect I just care about making a good game." (Reveals core motivation)
- "Basically, the compiler decided that right here, where I want to avoid the division by 0. It is going to pipeline the division into the delay slot of my branch. So that no matter what happens, I always divide by 0. That's not a bug in the code. That is not my fault." (Highlights deep technical challenges and frustrations)
- "Having an interconnected world is okay. I don't hate on it, but I think it's nicer if the worlds are like separate and the interconnectedness comes from the overworld alone." (Shows clear design philosophy)

## Game Development Process
- Currently focusing on specific level elements, particularly in one room, involving the implementation and refinement of "Whomp" enemy mechanics and interactions.
- A significant milestone being worked towards is the completion of the first star in the current level, which involves setting up five "troll" objectives for the player.
- The project has reached a stage where ROM size optimization is a critical ongoing task, involving removing unused assets (like SM64 backgrounds) and compressing sound samples.
- Regular testing on N64 hardware is part of the process, including live debugging of hardware-specific crashes (e.g., a floating point exception related to background color tables).
- Development involves iterative design of gameplay mechanics, level layout adjustments (e.g., shortening or removing sections for flow and performance), and integrating assets from collaborators.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses genuine enthusiasm for visual improvements, such as new shadow effects ("Did I really love how the shadows look it looks so cool").
- He holds a strong design philosophy emphasizing organic player discovery over explicit hand-holding ("It's like admitting oh, I can't make a good game. Let me just make sure the player knows how it works anyway...it's like the principle of show. Don't tell").
- Kaze displays confidence in his technical understanding of the N64 ("I definitely know a lot more about the n64 to Nintendo ever did").
- He reflects on how past professional game development experience has influenced his coding habits, sometimes in ways he finds amusingly overly cautious in the context of ROM hacking ("Working in professional game development fucked up my brain. Checking for a null pointer.").
- He values creating "cool platforming" and fun interactions over purely chasing difficulty.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub (Composer):
    - Is actively working on music for the game again after a hiatus.
    - Currently composing a song specifically for the level Kaze is working on.
    - Kaze notes Badub is "really putting in the effort," which is beneficial for the project.
    - Kaze: "Dude but dude [Badub] finally wrote me again today. He's back and he's making music again. He said he was looking into a song for this level...But he's really putting in the effort, which is really really good for us."
- Biobak (Graphics Artist):
    - No direct mention of "Biobak" by name in this transcript. Modeling and art contributions are attributed to "Albie" (see Other Contributors).
- Zeina (Animations):
    - Is working on animations for characters/enemies, including render range issues and potentially Whomp animations.
    - Kaze mentions: "render near at the extra pump Zena's working on it right now".
    - Kaze also discusses animation needs with someone who seems to be providing them, likely Zeina or Albie (e.g., requesting Whomp idle and tipping animations).
- Other Contributors:
    - **Albie:**
        - Provides models and animations. During the stream, Albie sent over Whomp idle and falling animations ("Alright, there you go one is idle two is falling over forwards Okay.").
        - Also modeled the "banana cat" meme object.
        - Kaze interacts directly with Albie via chat for asset delivery and feedback.
    - **KakitaDev:**
        - Mentioned in the context of Kaze optimizing some of KakitaDev's code for better N64 performance. This seems to be a friendly jab at another community developer.
        - Kaze: "KhakiDev is just salty that I changed his code to be a bit faster on the N64. His saltiest code wasn't optimized."
    - **Leela:**
        - Mentioned briefly at the start and later in a more interactive context ("Lila says to add the talking animation"). Seems to be someone present with Kaze during the stream, offering minor input.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Whomp Mechanics:** A significant portion of the stream is dedicated to deciding the Whomps' purpose and behavior. The idea evolves from them carrying beams to being building materials for a "Whomp tower" that players can knock over. This includes designing their animations, dialogue (being rude to Mario), and VFX for their collapse.
    - Challenge: Defining a fun and engaging role for the Whomps.
    - Solution: Iterative brainstorming leading to the Whomp tower concept, with community input.
- **Player Guidance for Multi-Part Objective:** A key challenge is guiding the player to interact with five specific "troll" NPCs/scenarios to earn a star, without resorting to obvious markers like exclamation points.
    - Challenge: Ensuring players discover all necessary interactions without explicit instructions.
    - Solution: Implementing multiple subtle layers of hints (e.g., NPC dialogue from a Wiggler, consistent Bowser helmets on target NPCs, NPCs being rude to invite interaction, environmental clues). Kaze: "I want as many hints as possible as many layers of you know safety as possible But I want not a single hint to be like overbearing."
- **Level Design and Pacing:** Kaze re-evaluates a platforming section, deeming it "meaningless" and a "prime candidate for just cutting it" to improve level flow and address performance concerns.
    - Challenge: Redundant or poorly performing level sections.
    - Solution: Willingness to cut or significantly alter existing level geometry.
- **N64 Hardware Limitations:** A recurring challenge is working within the N64's constraints, leading to N64-only crashes that need debugging and a constant focus on ROM size and performance optimization.
    - Challenge: Technical issues on target hardware.
    - Solution: Live debugging, code optimization, and careful asset management.
- **NPC Dialogue and Character:** Decisions are made about NPC dialogue to make them rude to Mario, thereby incentivizing the player to "mess with them." Text is refined to be concise yet characterful.
    - Challenge: Making NPC interactions meaningful and motivating.
    - Solution: Crafting dialogue that provides hints and personality, often with community input.

## Business Aspects
- **Potential Release Timing:** Kaze mentions a tentative release plan: "I'm planning to release it on the 30th. Which I think is like the deadline for someone's competition or something." This indicates a possible soft deadline or target tied to an external event.
- **Hardware Compatibility:** A strong emphasis is placed on ensuring the game runs correctly on actual N64 hardware, which is crucial for the ROM hack's target audience and distribution.
- No direct mentions of funding, specific marketing strategies beyond streaming, or sales plans were found in this transcript.

## Key Quotes
- "I actually Started optimizing the game for ROM size because we're at a point where we have to optimize the game for ROM size So I removed all the Mario 64 backgrounds." (Highlights a development phase and technical consideration)
- "The one thing I'm not sure about it's like what do the womps even do... So They're building something here they're like building a tower and there's just gonna be a tower made out of lumps I Like that... Now that's really cool that is such a funny idea." (Shows the iterative design process and joy in creative solutions)
- "The problem is how do you know to do all the five of them? ... I Mean, I want as many hints as possible as many layers of you know safety as possible But I want not a single hint to be like overbearing." (Articulates a core game design challenge regarding player guidance)

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is an N64 ROM hack. The stream shows work on the 11th course, an oil rig level.
- Kaze states there are "Four after this [levels until complete]" for the game.
- Current development focus is on the oil rig level, specifically:
    - Implementing Koopa Troopa NPC interactions and "trolls" (messing with them).
    - Designing and modeling a Wiggler character to act as an "overseer" who reacts to the player's actions.
    - Creating animations for characters like baby penguins (walking, waddle, dive) and the Wiggler.
    - Refining mechanics like glass shattering, ensuring they are visually convincing without complex physics simulations.
    - Working on NPC dialogue and reactions to player actions.
- A major milestone anticipated is finishing the first star/mission of the current oil rig level, involving the Wiggler and various Koopa interactions.
- The engine is described as "super optimized" to run on real N64 hardware.
- Skybox for the current level is a placeholder and will eventually be an "infinitely far background."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze reflects on his growth as a designer: "Back when I was making last impact I was just like whenever I had an idea i would just put it in almost like unfiltered and i would definitely like think more about what actually is worth putting in and less like just put stuff in you know... I should have been spending at least 20 of the time designing."
- He expresses a strong dislike for "cryptic" game design, preferring intuitive mechanics, leading to decisions like scrapping an oil barrel puzzle.
- Kaze values humor and expressiveness in character animations and interactions, as seen with the Koopas' reactions.
- He has strong opinions on control schemes, advocating for "controller plus mouse" as a superior setup.
- He believes that simply because "Mario 64 does it is a bad excuse overall" for design choices, indicating a willingness to deviate from the base game's conventions if he sees better alternatives.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Badoop):**
    - Is composing the soundtrack for the oil rig level in "Return to Yoshi's Island."
    - Kaze mentions Badoop "has some pretty good ideas" and is still working on the track, with Kaze finding some parts not "perfect yet" but liking the overall direction.
- **Biobak (Biobank):**
    - Mentioned humorously in the context of a song Kaze plays ("this would be like his theme song").
    - No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this transcript, though the prompt implies he is a graphics artist for the project.
- **Zeina:**
    - Is responsible for animations. Kaze states, "She's making all of them [penguin animations] right now."
    - Zeina confirms her role: "I'm just helping out with animations. And anything else that he needs."
    - She provides input on model details (e.g., closing a hole in the penguin model).
    - Kaze anticipates the Wiggler will be "probably the most difficult one to animate yet," a task likely falling to Zeina.
    - She is also working on penguin idle animations.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Zero World:** Mentioned as "making music right now for one of the 8-bit sections in this game." He is allowed to make changes to improve existing loops.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Oil Rig Level Theme:** The core concept is a mission where the player messes with various Koopa NPCs. "The idea is just that you mess with a bunch of NPCs and you just mess with everyone once. That's like the whole mission."
- **Glass Shattering Mechanic:**
    - Initial ideas involved many small pieces, which was deemed too much work for modeling and importing.
    - Iterated to a simpler two-piece split, with a focus on "faking" physics to look convincing.
    - Koopas carrying the glass react with sadness/anger when it's broken.
- **Scrapping the Oil Slick Puzzle:** An idea involving kicking an oil barrel to make a Koopa slip was removed because Kaze felt "kicking the oil barrel is not intuitive and also that's not very funny."
- **Wiggler Overseer:**
    - Introduced as a character who gets progressively more upset as the player completes "trolls" on Koopas.
    - Design challenge: Balancing the visual detail (e.g., multiple hard hats on segments) with the N64's polygon budget. "Yeah, but a thousand triangles is too much. Can't waste my polygon budget like that." This led to simplifying the model.
- **Wing Cap Inclusion:** Decided to add a Wing Cap as an optional "cool stupid bonus" in the oil rig level, not required for progression.
    - Challenge: Preventing players from accessing out-of-bounds areas. Solution: Using an "invisible wall."
- **Lighting Issues:** Kaze acknowledges some lighting problems ("Please try to fix the lighting issues please") but seems to believe they will be resolved eventually, possibly by chance or by fixing specific problematic assets (like a box).
- **NPC Dialogue:** Writing specific lines for Koopas reacting to their predicaments, e.g., "That was the only glass window they had bowser's gonna be pissed," or "There goes this year's salary."

## Business Aspects
- No direct mentions of marketing, funding, or specific release plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" itself within this transcript.
- Kaze mentions receiving free hardware (capture cards, monitors, speakers, projectors) from Chinese manufacturers for review, which relates to his broader presence as a developer and streamer rather than RTYI funding.

## Key Quotes
- "So right now we're making this oil rig level, where you just mess with Bowser's minions. You destroy their plans to like build Bowser's base here." (Kaze explaining the current level of RTYI)
- "Back when I was making last impact I was just like whenever I had an idea I would just put it in almost like unfiltered and I would definitely like think more about what actually is worth putting in and less like just put stuff in you know." (Kaze on his evolving design philosophy)
- "Dude, having the first mission done is gonna feel so huge." (Kaze on completing the main objective in the current oil rig level)
- "Yeah, but a thousand triangles is too much. Can't waste my polygon budget like that." (Kaze on balancing visual detail with N64 limitations for the Wiggler model)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore Kaze's overarching vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island": How does this oil rig level and its "mess with NPCs" theme fit into the larger narrative or game structure?
- Delve into the collaborative workflow: How do Kaze, Zeina (animations), and Badub (music) typically exchange ideas, provide feedback, and integrate their work for a cohesive level experience?
- Discuss the evolution of Kaze's game design principles from earlier projects like "Last Impact" to "Return to Yoshi's Island," particularly his approach to balancing player freedom, intuitive design, and comedic elements within the N64's constraints.
- Investigate the technical hurdles and innovative solutions involved in developing a large-scale ROM hack on original N64 hardware, touching upon engine optimization, polygon budgeting, and achieving desired visual/gameplay effects.
- Unpack the decision-making process for specific interactive elements in the oil rig level (e.g., Koopa reactions, Wiggler behavior, glass breaking): How are ideas brainstormed, prototyped, and refined or discarded based on fun factor, technical feasibility, and intuitiveness?

## Game Development Process
-   **RTYI Engine Development:** Kaze is actively refining an engine (referred to as "RTYI engine") based on the Mario 64 decompilation. He plans to release "one or two more hacks on the RTYI engine before RTYI is released just to like get everything a little bit improved."
-   **Iterative Improvement:** Kaze uses playtest data from other projects (e.g., "Only Up 64") to inform improvements for the RTYI engine.
-   **Current Focus:** Work during the stream includes improving physics, camera, ceiling interactions, redesigning warps, developing NPC behaviors (Wiggler overseer, Koopa with cement), and implementing visual effects (cement dirtiness).
-   **Code Quality:** Kaze is making efforts to improve code readability and maintainability by converting magic numbers to defines with comments, inspired by practices from other projects.
-   **Testing:** Kaze primarily tests on emulators and only tests on N64 hardware when making performance-specific changes.
-   **Tooling:** Kaze uses Blender with the "Fast64" plugin for modeling, animation, and exporting assets.

## Personal Insights
-   **On Game Feel:** Kaze is very focused on game feel, discussing input lag (60fps vs 30fps), physics interactions (slope jumps, ceiling bonks), and warp transitions, aiming for improvements over or different from vanilla SM64.
-   **On Vanilla SM64:** He acknowledges a "rose tinting with vanilla Mario 64 collision" and believes some oddities players attribute to his hacks are actually present in the original game.
-   **On Player Experience:** Kaze considers how his own expertise might make him overlook difficulties casual players could face: "Actually, by being bad at Mario 64, you have better chances of making a good attack. Because if you're good at Mario 64, there's going to be many random things in your game that you won't notice that casual players will have huge problems with."
-   **On SM64 Hacking Trends:** He comments on a past trend in SM64 hacking (around 2013-2015) where creators boasted about high polygon counts as a measure of detail, which he found inefficient.
-   **Self-Assessment:** "I think I'm very good at what I'm doing but there are definitely people out there that know more about how to fuck with the n64 than me I just happen to be very good like Mario 64 and that optimization I think I'm the best optimization guy but just general and 64 nope that ain't me."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:** No direct interaction in this transcript. His music ("OST") for "Only Up 64" (which uses the RTYI engine) is mentioned, and Kaze plays a new version of a track, implying Badub is likely involved with music for projects using this engine, possibly RTYI itself.
-   **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** Kaze mentions, "I can help you with some models since I'm a little more confident in my skills now," and Kaze later considers asking Biobak to "find a friend of mine model a jacket." Biobak also makes a suggestion for Wiggler's standing pose ("Is this what Biobank meant?").
-   **Zeina (Animations):** Actively collaborates with Kaze during the stream.
    -   Kaze assigns Zeina tasks like creating a penguin's idle animation ("that's your first task for the day then").
    -   Kaze requests a "sobbing animation" for a Koopa NPC from Zeina and sends her an updated Koopa model.
    -   Zeina sends Kaze an animation for the Koopa crying, which Kaze reviews and provides feedback on live.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Cozy:** Credited with writing a "fast 64 script" (Blender plugin functionality).
    -   **Marbler:** Kaze mentions taking notes from "how we work in years for breakfast," implying learning from collaborative experiences with Marbler on those projects.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Wiggler Overseer NPC:** A major design element discussed is a Wiggler character who acts as an "overseer" on an oil rig. The Wiggler will react with increasing anger (visual changes like turning red, puffing smoke, new animations) as the player "ruins the day" of various worker NPCs. Eventually, the Wiggler will give up and leave.
-   **Cement Ruining Easter Egg:** Kaze implements a feature where a Koopa NPC is building with cement, and the player can ruin it by walking on it. If the player makes "almost the entire area black," an Easter egg triggers where the Koopa starts crying and has new dialogue ("Do you want to make me cry?").
    -   **Challenge:** Optimizing the detection of "dirtiness" on the cement texture to avoid iterating through all 16,384 texels. Kaze devises an approximation method that checks a subset of pixels.
-   **Warp Redesign:** Kaze is unhappy with the current warp transition ("it just does that") and plans to change it so player inputs are held, and Mario's normal actions continue during the warp, aiming for a smoother 60fps experience.
-   **Physics and Collision:** Adjustments to ceiling interactions (bonking instead of getting stuck). Discussion about slope jumps and how they are a vanilla SM64 mechanic that players sometimes misunderstand in hacks.
-   **Model Complexity:** Kaze encounters a Wiggler model from R64DS with "way too many triangles" and discusses methods like the decimate modifier or simplifying parts (e.g., feet). He generally prefers efficient models.
-   **Input Lag:** Kaze discusses player perceptions of input lag, attributing some of it to lower framerates (30fps on N64) or the transition from 60fps to 30fps, rather than inherent issues in his game. He states 60fps "significantly reduces the input lag."

## Business Aspects
-   **Streaming Platform Change:** Kaze switched from Twitch to YouTube for streaming, citing "too many ads" on Twitch making it unenjoyable.
-   **Monetization:** Kaze notes receiving "real super chat donations on YouTube" for the first time. He briefly considers subscribing to Twitter Blue to potentially monetize his tweets but is hesitant due to the requirements and image.
-   **Pre-Release Strategy:** The plan to "make like one or two more hacks on the RTYI engine before RTYI is released" could be seen as a way to test the engine, gather feedback, and build anticipation for the main RTYI project.

## Key Quotes
-   "I have made some changes since last time only up 64 was really really useful playtest data and I'm gonna use the playtest data to prove RTYI we should make like one or two more hacks on the RTYI engine before RTYI is released just to like get everything a little bit improved." (Highlights iterative development and engine strategy)
-   "so we have this oil rig here and the wiggler is gonna be right here he's the overseer... and then you go and you like go to the Koopas and you fucking break their heart and there's a little bit of a cutscene of the wiggler doing like an angry animation and going slightly red..." (Describes a key NPC interaction and game design concept)
-   "I took notes from how we work in years for breakfast and I decided I will make all the magic numbers into defines in this file and I even added comic comments that follow some sort of code guidelines so now we have all the defines for like Mars physics and the camera even and they're super easy to modify."

## Game Development Process
- Actively developing new gameplay mechanics, such as a rideable "soap bar" (referred to as "soul bar" initially) that shrinks over time and can be used to clean "oil slicks."
- Working on UI elements, specifically a new star select screen featuring small 3D panoramas for each level to convey its "vibe."
- Iterative development on visual effects, including custom particle systems for soap bubbles (texture, color, fade, quantity) and exploring shaders/texture manipulation for oil slick appearance.
- The project is based on the Mario 64 decompilation.
- Mentions fixing bugs in a previous project (OnlyUp64), indicating a commitment to polish that likely extends to "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI).
- Progress is made on features within single streams (e.g., "programmed the whole soap bar just today").
- Discussions around ROM space optimization and performance considerations for N64 hardware/emulators are ongoing.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze values originality and is confident in his creative process ("See, I have never seen Anon's idea, so that doesn't matter, because that means I didn't steal it.").
- He places high importance on visual appeal and "flare" in game development ("Adding visual flare is important to the game... Your game would just look like a shadow of a game and not a real game.").
- Expresses a pragmatic approach to development, often creating custom solutions (e.g., particle engine) to meet specific needs.
- Openly shares opinions on tools (dislike for Parallel Launcher's frequent updates, preference for Project64, excitement for a potential new tool), game design, and even off-topic subjects.
- Shows a preference for moving forward with new development rather than extensively revisiting old projects ("I don't like going back and updating shit"), though he does fix bugs.
- Has a clear vision for how elements should "feel" and "look," iterating until satisfied.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (also referred to as "Biomech"):**
    - A significant contributor to visual design.
    - Provided "pretty cool ideas" and a mockup for the new star select screen that Kaze prefers.
    - Requested specific visual features for particles, such as bubbles fading to white ("This is what Biomech has asked for.").
    - Kaze discusses Biobak's ideas for oil puddle fading.
- **Zeina:**
    - Mentioned as being "at work" during the stream ("Zeyna is actually at work right now").
    - Her specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are not detailed in this transcript, but her mention implies involvement or association with Kaze's development circle.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Anonymous Moose:** Mentioned as having come up with an idea (related to the Wiggler or another mechanic) that Kaze also independently conceived.
    - **Unnamed tool developer:** Kaze mentions a "guy that made a really, really useful tool 20 years ago" who is now making a new one, which Kaze is excited about. This suggests potential use of new community tools.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Star Select Screen:** Debating between using images (texture-based panoramas) versus pre-rendered 3D scenes. The decision leans towards 3D scenes due to ROM space efficiency (0.3-0.5 MB per course for textures is too much) and better upscaling on emulators.
- **"Soap Bar" Mechanic:**
    - Designed as a rideable object that shrinks and disappears over time, preventing indefinite use.
    - Technical challenges included inverted normals, refining collision, Mario's animation when falling off, and controlling how it shrinks (from the bottom, requiring Mario's offset).
    - Visuals (sparkles, size) were iterated upon.
- **Particle Effects (Soap Bubbles):**
    - Decision to create custom bubble particles for better control over rendering and appearance (color, fade to white, transparency, quantity).
    - Addressed issues with finding suitable bubble textures and integrating them.
    - Kaze's custom particle engine avoids reloading textures for each particle, optimizing performance.
- **Oil Slick Mechanic:**
    - Designing a system where the soap bar cleans up oil slicks.
    - Challenge: How to make the cleanup visually effective and appealing (e.g., dynamically updating an alpha mask, making pixels black).
    - Explored adding a "shine" or rainbow effect using vertex color hue shifting based on camera angle, referencing Mario Kart oil slicks but ultimately questioning its realism for oil.
- **ROM Space & Performance:** Recurring considerations, influencing choices about textures, 3D models, and effects. Kaze removed original mk64 backgrounds to save ~0.3MB.
- **Bug Fixing:** Encountered and worked on various bugs, including inverted normals, object behavior issues (`numkeys` variable, `actWritingShell`), and crashes.
- **Water Level Manipulation:** Considered for the overworld (an island you rescue) to show water returning over time. An existing, different type of water level manipulation is in "All Alone Bubble Dome." Porting the "World Dry World" version is a long-term idea.

## Business Aspects
- **Funding:** A "new donation link in the description of the stream" is mentioned, indicating community donations as a source of support.
- **Release Plans:** Implied intention to release the game, with comments like, "That's definitely something we have to fix before release."

## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus:** Primarily on integrating and refining new 3D models and textures provided by collaborator Biobank. This includes models for game objects (switches, blocks), enemies (Goomba, fish), and environmental effects (fire, stars).
- **Level Development:** Actively working on specific levels, such as "Bozo's office."
- **Technical Refinement:** Ongoing work to fix N64-specific issues like floating point exceptions and addressing bugs related to the Fast64 toolchain.
- **Performance Optimization:** Conscious of performance implications of new assets, such as texture memory (e.g., fish model discussion) and render times, though sometimes prioritizes visual fidelity or development speed over micro-optimizations (e.g., "Two triangles don't matter," using separate models for cap switch states instead of bones).
- **Iterative Cycle:** The stream showcases a cycle of model import, in-game testing, identifying issues (visual glitches, incorrect behavior, crashes), debugging, and making iterative adjustments based on Kaze's judgment and collaborator feedback.
- **Tooling Challenges:** Kaze expresses frustration with limitations or bugs in the development tools (Fast64, lack of automatic render area calculation) and N64 hardware, often requiring workarounds.
- **Asset Overhaul:** A significant portion of development involves replacing or heavily modifying vanilla Mario 64 assets with custom, higher-quality versions.

## Personal Insights
- **Strong Aesthetic Opinions:** Kaze has clear preferences for visual style and quality, often criticizing original Mario 64 assets ("vanilla blue switch... looks like dog shit") and striving for specific looks (e.g., smoother edges on textures, better lighting).
- **Pragmatism in Development:** While aiming for high quality, Kaze sometimes makes pragmatic choices to save development time or avoid overly complex solutions, especially if the tools are cumbersome (e.g., his stance on "switch bones" vs. multiple models for cap switches: "You're wasting minutes of my life having me implement a switch bone when they basically don't really work at all").
- **Problem-Solving Approach:** Demonstrates a persistent, hands-on approach to debugging and finding solutions to technical and visual issues, often thinking aloud and trying different methods.
- **Humor and Persona:** Maintains a humorous and sometimes irreverent persona during the stream (e.g., the "Mario 64, what is that?" running gag).
- **Reflection on Tools/Process:** Openly discusses frustrations with development tools and limitations, wishing for better features (e.g., "I've asked for a feature to manually and to automatically compute it [render area] so many times now").

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - **Primary Contributor:** The stream is heavily centered around integrating a large number of 3D models and textures created by Biobank ("today is probably going to be the bio backstream," "we are going to import all of Biobank's remade models today").
    - **Scope of Work:** Provides models for various game elements including switches (blue coin switch, cap switches), enemies (fish, Goomba), effects (ground pound stars, fire), and interactive blocks ("Net peanut"/sludge blarg boss).
    - **Interaction:** Kaze provides direct feedback to Biobank during the stream, discusses design choices, and makes technical adjustments to Biobank's assets for in-game implementation. Biobank also seems responsive, offering to update textures based on feedback (e.g., coin texture, button contrast).
    - **Creative Input:** Biobank proposes designs (e.g., switch designs, "Net peanut" concept) which Kaze then refines or implements. Kaze praises Biobank's ideas ("Biobank deserves a medal for that" regarding the sludge blarg's design).
- **Zeina (Animator):**
    - **Implied Contributions:** Kaze mentions handling Thwomp animations ("I'm just sending you Thwomp's animations right quick"). While not explicitly stated Zeina made them *in this transcript*, the prompt identifies her as the animator. This suggests Zeina provides animations that Kaze then integrates.
    - **Technical Animation:** For a new boss ("Net peanut"), Biobank suggests Kaze might be better suited for its "very technical animation," indicating a collaborative decision-making process on animation tasks.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lila (Chat Contributor):** Actively provides real-time feedback on visuals, such as contrast on a button texture ("Lila is saying this needs more contrast") and design elements of an exclamation mark. Kaze acknowledges and sometimes acts on this feedback.
    - **XPM (Asset Contributor):** Mentioned as the creator of a cloud texture Kaze is still using ("Yes, I'm still using your cloud texture, I think, XPM. It has survived the test of time").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Visual Fidelity vs. Performance:** A recurring theme, e.g., choosing RGBA16 over CI4 for smoother texture edges despite larger size, or optimizing fish models to use fewer textures for batch rendering.
- **Lighting and Shading:** Extensive discussion on how to light models – baked lighting in textures vs. dynamic level lighting vs. vertex colors. Kaze generally prefers models to interact with world/level lighting ("it's usually better to have it work with world lights so that it actually looks like it's placed in the world"). This often involves complex combiner setups and texture adjustments.
- **Tool-Induced Challenges (Fast64):** Many problems are attributed to Fast64 bugs or limitations:
    - Armature import issues ("if you reimport the armature, Fuzz64 will fuck it up").
    - Texture loading order affecting performance if not handled correctly (Goomba feet texture).
    - Rendering inconsistencies between editor and game.
- **Floating Point Exceptions on N64:** Identified as an "annoying as fuck" issue to fix for several levels when running on actual N64 hardware.
- **Animation Design for Interactive Objects:**
    - **Cap Switches:** Kaze opts for using multiple distinct models for different states of cap switches rather than "switch bones" due to perceived unreliability and difficulty of the latter.
    - **Blue Coin Switch:** Decides against a complex animation due to its brief on-screen time (5 frames).
- **Gameplay Feel and Object Interaction:** Considers how objects behave and feel, e.g., the impact sound for a switch ("Okay, I want the stone sound"), how Mario interacts with new collision, and the visual feedback of a switch being pressed.
- **Reimagining Vanilla Elements:** Conscious decision to replace or significantly alter original SM64 models and behaviors Kaze deems subpar (e.g., "All the vanilla models are awful").

## Business Aspects
- **Content Creation Strategy:** Kaze mentions studying MrBeast's videos ("I actually study MrBeast's videos like a fucking nerd. I look at them and be like, Oh, why do people like this? How can I implement this?") This indicates a conscious effort to improve his streaming/YouTube content engagement, which is a form of marketing and audience building for his projects.
- **Monetization Stance:** Briefly touches on monetization when asked for a link to EverDrives: "I'm not going to advertise someone's products here for free... They need to pay me, I'm not posting it." This shows an awareness of his platform's value.
- **Donations:** Acknowledges a $5 donation, indicating community financial support via streaming.

## Key Quotes

- "For the new sign video, I needed to record a lot of N64 footage. And unfortunately, I found out that a lot of the levels have floating point exceptions when you enter them right now on N64. Which is not going to be difficult to fix, but it's going to be annoying as fuck." (Illustrates a common development challenge and Kaze's attitude towards it)
- "All the vanilla models are awful. Damn. Give me one vanilla Mario 64 model that is not awful." (Showcases Kaze's strong opinions and the motivation behind the visual overhaul)
- "It never works for me [switch bones]. I don't know what you're doing differently. This is going to be our render area. You weren't kidding. This is a biomextreme today." (Emphasizes tool frustrations and his preferred workarounds, and again, the focus on Biobank's contributions)
- "I think that we can say that this is just a bug on the emulator plugin. Because I see no reason this wouldn't work... No, it renders like this even on NEMU. Something is definitely wrong in the combiner." (Demonstrates the debugging process and cross-referencing issues on different emulators/hardware)

## Game Development Process
- The game is stated to be approximately 75% complete ("75 mean Quick 64. Yeah").
- Current focus includes integrating character assets (models, animations like Wiggler's) and programming their behavior.
- Development of specific levels and quests is ongoing, such as "Bowser's office," the "Union Mission" involving a strike and a "strike breaker" boss, and the "Wild West Valley" level.
- Work includes reworking existing levels for visual and performance improvements (e.g., the "biomech" level).
- Implementation of new game systems like an options menu and Yoshi Coins (replacing 100-coin stars) is in progress.
- A significant amount of dialogue is being written and implemented (169 dialogues mentioned, more than double SM64).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a long-standing enjoyment of core Mario mechanics ("Dude ever since I was little I loved stomping Koopas").
- He reflects on the potential negative impact of AI on human creativity and purpose ("It's like why even try if something better can be done without any effort?").
- He is pragmatic about the risks involved in ROM hacking, such as timing game releases to avoid Nintendo takedowns ("I like to release my games around September and Just because that's the time where it's like least likely Nintendo's gonna take them down").
- He shows a desire to create unique and atmospheric experiences, focusing on level design and narrative elements like the "Union Mission."
- Kaze is candid about the challenges of development, including debugging and working within technical limitations.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):**
    - Provided a new song for the second Bowser level.
    - The music is designed with dynamic layers ("disable two channels and you get an indoors version and you can enable another channel to get an outdoors version") for atmospheric effect.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist/Designer):**
    - Contributes 3D models and level design ideas.
    - Kaze consults with Biobak on concepts like the "conspiracy theory Yoshi room" and the aesthetics of the "child's room" level.
    - Described as "not a programmer. He does some 3D modeling on the air."
- **Zeina (Animator):**
    - Provides character animations, specifically mentioned for Wiggler (e.g., walk, jump, angry poses, stomping off).
    - Kaze was in the process of importing and integrating Zena's new Wiggler animations during the stream.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Pileback:** Provided an "assessment" or suggestion for the "child's room model" area.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Reworks:** The "biomech" level was significantly changed to feel more "vast" and "near infinite" with an improved cloud ocean and lighting.
- **Camera System:** Dealing with camera issues in tight spaces (like the elevator) is a challenge. Planned solutions include sphere collision for the camera and potentially fixed camera angles in specific locations.
- **Hitbox Design:** Approximating complex character shapes (like Wiggler) with N64's limited cylindrical hitboxes requires creative solutions ("What if he's just two cylinders like this?").
- **Quest/Narrative Design:** The "Union Mission" features a multi-stage narrative where minions strike, Bowser sends a "strike breaker," the plaza becomes ominous, and a boss (oil monster) attacks Mario.
- **Debugging:** A significant portion of the stream shows Kaze actively debugging various issues, such as elevator mechanics, object positioning (Toxboxes), and texture/animation glitches (Wiggler's face with Fast64).
- **Wiggler's Interactive Dialogue:** Wiggler's dialogue will change based on which parts of the construction site Mario has interfered with, serving as a hint system.
- **Technical Limitations:** Constant need to work within the N64's constraints regarding performance, rendering, and object complexity.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Strategy:** Kaze prefers releasing games around September, believing it's a time when Nintendo is less likely to issue takedowns.

-   Actively working on creating and refining game assets, like boss animations, and addressing technical bugs related to them.
-   Kaze mentions working on a "Banjo hack," indicating that "Return to Yoshi's Island" is one of several projects he juggles, potentially impacting its development timeline.
-   Technical aspects like managing ROM space for assets (e.g., a large song file) and optimizing game performance (FPS) are ongoing concerns.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses strong opinions on technical subjects, such as his critique of the Quake inverse square root algorithm's specific optimizations.
-   He reflects deeply on the challenges of game design within the ROM hacking scene, particularly concerning player expectations for 100% completion. He feels this expectation can stifle design freedom for truly hidden or difficult optional content.
    -   "I actually had a pretty big revelation today. And that is, that there's a problem with playing ROM-Mix. And that is that the player's expectation is that they can easily 100% the game... And I think that really takes away a lot of design space."
-   Kaze has a defined philosophy on handling community feedback: he believes player feelings are valid and must be acknowledged, but their proposed reasons or solutions can often be misguided.
    -   "See, my philosophy is, what people feel, in a way, is real. You can't change that fact. But their reasoning is most of the time stupid."
-   He shows passion for creating a rich game world, emphasizing the importance of secrets in the overworld.
    -   "The overworld needs to be full of secrets. That is so important. That's gonna make or break the game. Guaranteed."

    -   **Chat Participants (e.g., MarioBag, Clayman):** Provide real-time feedback, suggestions (like camera adjustments or ideas for game mechanics), and engage in discussions, influencing Kaze's thought process.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Player Expectations vs. Design Freedom:** A major philosophical challenge is managing the common ROM hack player expectation of being able to 100% a game easily, which Kaze feels limits the ability to include very hard or obscure secrets. He ran a poll to gauge community sentiment on this.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Dealing with FPS drops (e.g., Mario's animations running at 30 FPS instead of 60) is a recurring technical challenge, sometimes linked to integrating external code.
-   **ROM Space Management:** A cool song idea for a "grand trial" is hampered by its large file size (5MB), highlighting the constraint of limited ROM space.
-   **Boss Design & Balancing:**
    -   Detailed work on a boss's attack patterns, movement, and visual cues (e.g., "oil" properties, appearance).
    -   Consideration of camera behavior during the boss fight to ensure good visibility for the player.
    -   Debating the penalty for failing in the boss arena (e.g., falling into oil), aiming for a balance that isn't overly frustrating. "I think water with damage over time is perfect."
-   **Difficulty Customization / Perk System:** Brainstorming a system of findable "perks" in the overworld (e.g., "no void outs," "higher spin jump") that players could equip one at a time. This is an attempt to offer difficulty modulation and cater to different playstyles without implementing a full RPG-like badge system.
    -   "If we have these badges just be findable in the overworld, and then you can just select one of them as like a special perk... I'm kind of fine with that."
-   **Overworld Design:** Strong emphasis on creating a "massive and intricate" overworld filled with secrets, considered crucial for the game's success.

## Business Aspects
-   **Community Engagement/Audience Research:** Kaze uses YouTube polls (e.g., on 100% completion expectations) to gather direct feedback from his audience, which can inform design decisions.
-   **Potential Collaboration/Outreach:** Kaze mentioned a discussion about potentially co-hosting or being a guest on a software engineering podcast with James Lambert, which could serve as a promotional or networking opportunity.
    -   "...the suggestion we had was that me and James Lambert on the podcast would, like, interview each other."
-   No direct mentions of funding, specific release dates, or distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript segment.

## Key Quotes
-   "I actually had a pretty big revelation today. And that is, that there's a problem with playing ROM-Mix. And that is that the player's expectation is that they can easily 100% the game... We can't put hard challenges without people complaining. We can't put super secret hidden stuff without people complaining. And I think that really takes away a lot of design space."
-   "This is actually Silas' code He gave me a new version of this that is supposedly a lot faster But it does not seem to work... Okay, I'll let Celes [Silas] know."
-   "The overworld needs to be full of secrets. That is so important. That's gonna make or break the game. Guaranteed."

- **Engine Enhancements:** Kaze has made significant improvements to his custom engine based on the Mario 64 decompilation. This includes reducing render time (e.g., a 5% improvement, saving 600 microseconds), making it easier to add shadows and culling radiuses to objects, and optimizing RAM usage.
- **Current Focus Areas (during the stream):**
    - Implementing a new, visually enhanced Star Select screen, including integrating assets from Biobak, programming animations, and resolving layout/centering issues.
    - Developing the "oil block" functionality and visuals.
    - Creating a robust player respawn system for when Mario falls into hazards, involving logic to find safe respawn points on level geometry.
- **Optimization:** A continuous effort, particularly in culling (fixing original SM64 culling logic to be more effective) and ensuring features run efficiently on N64 hardware (e.g., aiming for 60 FPS on the Star Select screen).
- **Iterative Development:** The stream shows a clear iterative process of coding, testing, debugging, and refining features (e.g., Star Select alignment, respawn behavior, camera adjustments).

## Personal Insights
- **Excitement about Technical Achievements:** Kaze expresses significant enthusiasm for performance gains: "this week was insane I found so many improvements literally I reduced render time by like 5% almost... 5% is so much I went from like 44 FPS to 46."
- **Frustration with External Factors:** He mentions frustration with YouTube channel logistics affecting video views: "I'm really sad that I fucked up today and I accidentally scheduled two videos on the shorts channel for today... and that's why it's getting less views than it should but yeah devastating."
- **Pragmatism and Tool Usage:** Kaze is open to using modern tools like ChatGPT for assistance with complex coding tasks: "Dude, it fucking works. That is so insane. You guys have no idea how hard that would have been to program by myself. And this is why I like chatgpd."
- **Strong Opinions on Development Practices:** He has firm views on certain development approaches, notably his preference for C++ over visual scripting tools like Blueprints for core programming: "fuck him honestly fuck him they have problem you know what pigs they like to roll around on dirt I'm not gonna stop them let them have fun let them roll around on dirt."
- **Sense of Humor and Candor:** Kaze often uses humor and speaks candidly about development struggles and successes.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** Implied to be the composer. Kaze asks chat for "OST wishes for today," suggesting music selection is part of the stream or ongoing work. He also critiques a currently playing song ("this music fucking sucks dude").
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** A key collaborator providing visual assets.
    - Supplied new 3D models and designs for the Star Select screen (e.g., "bunny title.blend").
    - Kaze frequently refers to Biobak's intentions for the visuals and seeks clarification/feedback from him (or chat on his behalf) during the stream ("Is this screen the way we want the biobank?", "I think Biobank just wants it cut out, right?").
    - Communication seems to happen via Discord or similar platforms, with Kaze implementing Biobak's assets and vision.
- **Zeina (Animations):** Mentioned in a personal anecdote ("when Zeyna was over here I took her to see the seals"), but no specific contributions to the current development tasks in this stream are detailed.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Atlas:** Mentioned as the creator of star select screen assets, possibly using an array modifier in Blender ("Well atlas who's atlas it's an array modifier oh i see that works").
    - **Chat Members (e.g., Leela, Windows Empty, Platonically):** Actively provide feedback, suggestions, and engage in discussions, influencing Kaze's immediate troubleshooting and design thoughts.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Star Select Screen Redesign:**
    - **Goal:** Replace the "boring as shit" old star select with a more visually appealing and dynamic one, aiming for 60 FPS.
    - **Challenges:** Importing and scaling Blender models, aligning text and graphical elements, programming scrolling animations, ensuring correct rendering order, and fixing visual glitches (e.g., seams in scrolling background, pop-in).
    - **Solutions:** Decided to use one render function per selectable item for maximum flexibility instead of one geo layout. Extensive trial-and-error for positioning and animation.
- **Player Respawn System (Falling into Hazards):**
    - **Goal:** Create a fair and non-exploitable respawn mechanic where Mario fades out and reappears at a safe, recent location.
    - **Challenges:** Determining a "safe" respawn spot automatically, avoiding respawning inside geometry or on dangerous edges, handling camera transitions smoothly, and choosing appropriate death/respawn animations.
    - **Solutions:** Explored ideas like using the last non-object triangle Mario stood on. Used ChatGPT to generate code for calculating distance to triangle edges to validate respawn points. Iterated on camera behavior and Mario's animation state post-respawn.
- **Culling and Shadows:**
    - **Challenge:** Original SM64 culling was inefficient; adding shadows to enemies was difficult with Fast64.
    - **Solution:** Kaze fixed the culling logic for significant performance gains ("now everything that's off screen is actually getting culled"). His new engine simplifies adding shadows.
- **Camera Control Philosophy:**
    - **Decision:** Avoid explicit 8-direction camera snapping unless levels are designed for it (which they aren't in this game). Keep controls simple ("one button one output philosophy") to avoid making the game feel like a "tool."
- **Oil Block Visuals and Mechanics:** Mentioned as a task for the day, with initial thoughts on modeling a wave shape for the oil.
- **Decal System for Mario Effects:**
    - **Idea:** To add effects like oil stains, create a "decal Mario object" that renders over the normal Mario, allowing for transparency and fade effects.
    - **Consideration:** This is seen as a cool, performant way to add visual polish, but needs careful implementation if new Mario models are added later.

## Business Aspects
- **Patreon:** Mentioned as a way for supporters to identify themselves ("Let's say I'm a patron... you would have to tell me on patreon"). This implies Patreon is a source of community support/funding.
- **YouTube Channel Management:** Kaze discusses scheduling errors on his YouTube channels and the impact on video views, indicating an awareness of his online presence and audience engagement, which is relevant for marketing and visibility.
- **No explicit release/distribution plans discussed in detail**, other than the game being "in beta" and Kaze having access as a "beta tester" (referring to a tool or component, not necessarily the full game release status to public).

## Key Quotes
- "I made my engine a lot easier to use so now we can easily add shadows and culling radiuses to everything." (Highlights engine improvement and its impact)
- "we're missing like four and a half courses so we're like over 70% done at this point." (Provides a clear status update on game completion)
- "Basically, I fixed the culling so now everything that's off screen is actually getting culled and I put the culling into the object layout itself... and culling is correct and that saved like 600 microseconds... it's like a 3% improvement still that's insane." (Demonstrates technical problem-solving and impact)
- "Dude, it fucking works. That is so insane. You guys have no idea how hard that would have been to program by myself. And this is why I like chatgpd." (Shows candidness about challenges and embrace of modern tools)

## Game Development Process
-   Currently focused on developing the "Block Boss" fight for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
-   Significant progress on the boss fight mechanics was made off-stream, including performance improvements.
-   The stream covered work on the boss's fleeing animation, damage effects (color flashing, shaking, animation speed), and integrating a new song by Baduk.
-   Key tasks for the Block Boss include implementing its ability to disappear and reappear, defining player damage for failing certain mechanics, adding particles, and ensuring players take damage from an oil hazard.
-   The boss arena is undergoing a visual re-theme, moving from an oil barrel concept to a warehouse/cave hybrid.
-   ROM size is a critical concern, with music taking up a significant portion (approx. 35.6MB of a 64MB target). This necessitates exploring music compression or alternative audio formats.
-   The project is stated to have 11 out of 15 courses completed.
-   Kaze plans to finish the current Block Boss fight development off-stream.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze prefers to work on more complex development tasks off-stream to maintain focus.
-   He expresses strong opinions on various topics, including philosophy (criticism of Emanuel Kant), social norms ("swears being a bad thing is such an American concept"), and game design principles (dislike of button prompts, games becoming "chores").
-   He values performance and engine-level understanding, discussing topics like C++ vs C, object struct memory management, and optimal coordinate systems (Z-Up for cache coherency).
-   Kaze acknowledges the difficulty of making good games: "It's more so than just it's hard to make a good game, and most people just don't."
-   He balances his passion project with external responsibilities: "I have a full-time job. I can't work on this unlimitedly."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Baduk (Composer):**
    -   Contributed a "really good" new song for the Boombox Koopas.
    -   Kaze mentions Baduk's music contributions in the context of overall sound design.

    -   **Lila (Key Technical Collaborator):**
        -   Frequently addressed by Kaze regarding technical issues and bug fixes for "Fast64" (the SM64 modding toolset).
        -   Engaged in discussions about texture choices (e.g., tree stump texture) and low-level engine details (e.g., GeoASM node children).
        -   Her role appears crucial for maintaining/improving the development toolchain.
    -   **"the dupe" (Idea Contributor):**
        -   Suggested a music compression technique (streaming a repeating background beat separately).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Block Boss Mechanics:**
    -   Designed to flee when Mario is on a "soap" platform, with speed increasing as it takes damage.
    -   Visual feedback for damage includes color flashing (orange), shaking, and faster animations.
    -   The fight involves multiple phases, requiring the player to use soap to attack, dodge waves, and manage platforming elements.
    -   A key challenge is clearly communicating attack mechanics to the player (Kaze believes the soap's purpose is obvious).
    -   The boss will have action states like disappearing and reappearing, and a punishment phase for player failure.
-   **Boss Arena Design:**
    -   The arena theme is being iteratively designed, moving from an "oil barrel" to a "junkyard," "oil tankers," "warehouse," and finally a "cave/warehouse mix" with a tilted square layout.
    -   The arena will feature dynamic elements like "grills" that move up and down.
    -   A challenge lies in integrating the soap spawning mechanism thematically (e.g., strike workers in jail cells, a janitor Koopa throwing soap).
-   **Technical Obstacles:**
    -   **ROM Size Limit (64MB):** Music is the largest consumer of space, prompting considerations for sequenced music, mono audio, or reducing streamed tracks.
    -   **Fast64 Tool Bugs:** Issues with the modding toolset (e.g., animation data corruption, node hierarchy problems) require workarounds or fixes.
    -   **Memory Management:** Kaze opts to reuse existing object variables (like `all_health`) to conserve RAM, rather than expanding object structures or implementing dynamic memory systems, due to performance concerns on N64.
-   **Balancing Difficulty:** Kaze aims to "not want the gap between like a bad player and a good player to be too big."

## Business Aspects
-   Kaze discusses a recent increase in his personal YouTube revenue, which he speculates might be due to YouTube's changes regarding ad-blockers. This income supports him but is not presented as direct funding for the game project itself.
-   He mentions purchasing a house and moving soon, a personal life event.
-   There is no explicit mention of marketing strategies, dedicated funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island," or specific release/distribution plans, beyond the typical understanding that ROM hacks are community-distributed. The project's release is contingent on Kaze's available time due to his full-time job.

## Key Quotes
-   "I've made a lot of progress on this fight off stream as usual... this might be something that I have to do to offstream because this is a bit too complicated for stream." (Highlights development workflow and complexity management).
-   "The problem is that most of it is music and we can't really compress that because it has to be streamed directly from ROM... two-thirds of the ROM is just music that we cannot compress." (Pinpoints a major technical constraint).
-   "This area is just not turning out as I want it to be." (Illustrates the iterative and sometimes frustrating nature of creative design, specifically for the boss arena).
-   "Video games are not supposed to be chores! That's my rant for the day." (Reflects Kaze's core game design philosophy).

## Game Development Process
- The development is highly iterative, with Kaze primarily working on implementing and refining visual elements for Star Select screens (e.g., "Koopa Wave Cove," "Mouse Cave," "Bubble Dome") based on assets provided by collaborators.
- Significant progress is being made on these Star Select screens, involving animation, visual effects (fog, lighting, scrolling textures), and UI adjustments.
- A major milestone mentioned is the optimization of ROM space by 1.7 MB due to a tool from collaborator Arctic, allowing for more streamed music.
- Bug fixing is a continuous process, addressing issues like objects falling through floors, rendering errors, and animation glitches.
- Kaze often works through technical challenges live, such as N64 coordinate limitations forcing design changes (e.g., shortening a level element to prevent crashes).
- The order of asset creation and thus implementation can be driven by collaborator (Biobak's) preference: "it's basically just whatever biobank feels like making first gets made first."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong appreciation for high-quality art and music in games but believes game design is paramount (e.g., his opinion on Origami King: "the artists are so great the music is so great it's a shame that the game designers on this game are trash").
- He has a design philosophy of aiming for elegance and avoiding visual clutter, particularly in backgrounds: "We don't want the background to be too distracting... it kinda ruins the elegance of the background."
- Kaze is aware of his on-stream persona, acknowledging he can be "very easily irritated" but also quickly moves on.
- He shows a clear passion for N64 development, often diving into technical specifics and striving to push the console's capabilities.
- There's a recurring theme of wanting to create high-quality, polished experiences, evident in the detailed work on Star Select screens.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** While not directly interacting in this stream, the successful ROM space optimization by Arctic is noted to allow for "more streamed music," which is Badub's domain. Kaze also mentions a plan to "buy the music and like pay the musician off," indicating an intent to compensate the composer.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** Biobak is a key and active collaborator during the stream, providing 3D models, concepts, and feedback for various Star Select screens (Koopa Wave Cove, Mouse Cave, Koopa Carnival, Bubble Dome). Kaze spends much of the stream implementing and troubleshooting Biobak's assets (e.g., "Biobank modeled this at an insane scale," "Biobank feels like making first gets made first"). Biobak also suggests features and provides feedback live in chat (e.g., "move the text down," minecart animation).
- **Zeina (Animations):** Kaze mentions a future technical improvement: "as soon as we switch to Katerinian animations it's gonna be a lot less relevant." This suggests quaternion animations are planned, which would likely involve Zeina's expertise, though no direct contribution from Zeina is detailed in this specific stream.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Arctic:** A significant technical contributor. Arctic's tool "strm64" saved 1.7MB of ROM space, enabling more music. Kaze also consults Arctic's potential changes regarding music loop points ("did arctic remove the loop points").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **N64 Hardware Limitations:** A recurring challenge. For example, the N64's 30,000-33,000 coordinate range limit forces Kaze to redesign elements to prevent crashes ("If you render any object out of this range your n64 is just gonna crash"). Performance and ROM size are constant considerations.
- **Implementing Visuals & Animations:** Significant effort goes into creating dynamic and visually appealing Star Select screens. This involves challenges like getting text scrolling right, implementing fog effects effectively, animating objects along splines (minecart), and ensuring smooth performance.
- **Bug Fixing:** Kaze encounters and resolves various bugs, from Mario falling through platforms ("Mario just falls through these and just dies") to rendering glitches and animation issues.
- **Design Philosophy:** Decisions are made to maintain visual clarity and elegance, such as avoiding overly cluttered backgrounds ("We don't want the background to be too distracting").
- **Scope Management:** Kaze mentions an idea for a "small sequel minigame to the yoshi racing simulator" but decides against it as it "doesn't fit the scope of this game."

## Business Aspects
- **Funding and Compensation:** Kaze is transparent about the limited profitability of his YouTube channel and Patreon ("My YouTube as it is, is already barely even profitable... $6.90 last month"). This impacts his ability to pay collaborators, though he expresses a desire to do so, especially for music ("That would like buy the music and like pay the musician off"). Biobak's payment is humorously mentioned as "$5 per vertex, which I can't afford."
- **Marketing/Promotion:** Primarily informal, through Kaze's YouTube streams and videos. He mentions an upcoming "banger video" that he hopes will "make the bucks," possibly for increased visibility or income.
- **Release/Distribution:** No specific plans for release or formal distribution are discussed in this transcript. The focus is on ongoing development.

## Key Quotes
- "Arctic realized yesterday that his tool strm64 has some cool properties that allow us to save 1.7 megabytes of ROM space... which means we are allowed to have more streamed music than we thought." (Highlights a significant technical breakthrough and collaborator impact)
- "We don't want the background to be too distracting I think that there's a very tempting force to just add more and more shit Until it's just a clusterfuck of stuff, but it kinda ruins the elegance of the background." (Reveals Kaze's design philosophy)
- "If you render any object out of this range your n64 is just gonna crash I will have to bring the fog nearer But you're going beyond this it's just a crash." (Illustrates a concrete N64 limitation dictating design)

## Game Development Process
-   The stream shows active development on various aspects of "Return to Yoshi's Island," including boss fights (the "block boss," referred to sometimes as the "all-black boss"), cutscenes, star select screens, and specific level assets like a submarine and an animated bird for a level select backdrop.
-   Development involves iterative cycles of implementation, testing, and refinement, often in direct response to collaborator feedback (e.g., Biomech's requests for visuals).
-   Significant time is spent on debugging and troubleshooting technical issues related to N64 hardware limitations, custom tools (Fast64), rendering, and animation.
-   Kaze mentions working on significant portions of the game, like the "All-Black Boss," off-stream.
-   There's a clear process of planning and designing new game areas, such as level themes and "Retro Sections."
-   Kaze is moving to a new house, which will temporarily affect his streaming schedule but will result in a new dedicated workspace ("Kaze dungeon").

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses a strong desire to understand the root cause of technical problems rather than just finding a workaround: "You can't just be like, oh it works good enough. You have to be like why the fuck is it not doing what I expect? to do."
-   He values his community's engagement but maintains creative control, often injecting humor into his interactions and decisions regarding the stream itself (e.g., "I thought this was funnier" regarding stream title).
-   He has opinions on game design elements ("Music level sounds like shit. I don't actually like that idea.") and isn't afraid to voice them or change plans.
-   Kaze shows pride in his work, particularly when his YouTube content performs well: "This one's doing numbers... This video got more views in like not even two hours than most videos get like a day."
-   He reflects on the nature of game development: "Honestly, people say that everything in game development takes so long, but considering how big of a part this game is, and how much we just got done here, doesn't seem that much of a big deal to me."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (Biomech):** Appears to be a key collaborator, likely responsible for graphics, visual design, and specific asset requests. Kaze spends significant time implementing and troubleshooting Biobak's requests, such as animations for the star select screen, lighting effects, and the submarine. There's a direct back-and-forth: "This is not the fuck biomech wanted," "Okay, I think this is doing the thing that Biobank wants." Biobak also seems to work on star select screens independently ("Let's look at bio bags other star selects").
-   **Zeina:** Mentioned in the context of a previous project ("Donkey Donkey Mario 64," where she apparently contributed to dialogue: "No, seriously, who made the dialogue for that toad? I will not disclose. I will protect their identity. Haha.") and as someone Kaze plays games with. Her direct involvement in "Return to Yoshi's Island" is not detailed in this transcript beyond being a known associate Kaze interacts with.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Skellux:** Mentioned as the inspiration for the "pink bob-omb" character in Kaze's previous game, "Donkey Donkey Mario 64."
    -   **Master True:** Kaze mentions seeing "Runmic being made" by him, possibly referring to a tool or technique.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Boss Design:** The "block boss" fight is being worked on, with considerations for difficulty ("this boss is a bit too hard right now, especially once we add these things going down") and introductory cutscenes.
-   **Level Themes:** Active discussion and decision-making on level themes, including ideas like Wild West, casino, comic book superhero, Arctic/ice cream, and desert island. Some ideas are rejected (e.g., music level, Minus World).
-   **Retro Sections:** Plans for several "Retro Sections" based on classic Nintendo games: Paper Mario 64 (Goomba Town), Mario Paint, Dr. Mario, Mario Land 1, and Smash 64. Kaze is open to changing these if better ideas emerge.
-   **Technical Challenges:**
    -   Frequent rendering issues, including problems with vertex colors, combiners, and texture formats ("This is gonna look a little crunchy on the n64").
    -   A significant bug with a sine wave function due to a compiler issue where it linked "garbage data" without warning about a missing include (`math.h`).
    -   Debugging animation logic, such as the bird's take-off sequence on the level select screen ("Everything just freezes when I press A").
    -   Optimizing performance ("setting fuck on every single one of these it's kind of bad performance wise").
-   **Asset Creation & Animation:** Detailed work on animating a submarine with sine waves and a bird for a level select screen, including troubleshooting visual glitches and behavior.
-   **Star Placement:** A design guideline is mentioned: "in RTY I actually have the guideline that every star is exactly 300 rounds off the floor... Or no, every star is 200 floors, boxes are 300."
-   **Overworld Design:** The overworld is planned for a complete rework, with a "tropical island" theme inspired by Mario Party.

## Business Aspects
-   **YouTube Content:** Kaze monitors the performance of his YouTube videos ("This one's doing numbers") and mentions an upcoming video on the "fast inverse square root algorithm." This suggests YouTube is an important platform for outreach and community engagement.
-   **Streaming:** Decisions about stream titles and content are made with an eye for engagement and humor. He mentions an upcoming move and potential "bonus streams" or a week off, indicating streaming is a regular commitment.
-   **Monetization (Minor):** Briefly dismisses pinning a comment for money ("The views I lose from having unnecessary stuff like that pinned is far outweighing your five bucks."), but humorously adds "Actually do send me the money, but I'm still not doing it." This suggests direct fan funding isn't a primary driver for in-stream decisions.
-   **Release/Distribution:** No specific plans for release date or distribution methods are mentioned in this transcript, beyond the ongoing development of the ROM hack itself.

## Key Quotes
-   "You can't just be like, oh it works good enough. You have to be like why the fuck is it not doing what I expect? to do." (Reflects Kaze's dedication to understanding and solving technical issues thoroughly.)
-   "What the fuck how can it just link garbage data and not tell me... Because I would did not include the sine function needed for this and it still compiled the sine function somehow out of nothing." (Highlights a particularly frustrating and perplexing technical challenge.)
-   "I feel like I did 90% of the work on the Black Boss actually just off stream and not on stream, because every time I come on stream, there's a different thing that I have to do." (Provides insight into his work process and the nature of live development streams.)
-   "This is not the fuck biomech wanted... Okay, I think this is doing the thing that Biobank wants." (Illustrates the collaborative and iterative process with Biobak.)

## Game Development Process
- The game is actively being developed, with Kaze mentioning, "since the last stream I made so many updates to this game."
- A significant performance improvement (10-15%) was recently achieved, primarily by changing how coins are rendered (from billboards to screen-space sprites). Kaze states, "At this stage, that is crazy. I don't think we will ever see another performance improvement this big. Until we implement F3DX3."
- Development is progressing on new levels, with "Course 11" (the power plant) being the current focus for design and implementation of new platforming mechanics.
- Kaze has a clear plan for the structure of new levels, for example, for the power plant: "I have all five sections here planned out and I have two rooms sketched."
- The game uses custom music: "all music in this game is custom so we're not reusing some other games music."
- There's an ongoing effort to improve visuals, with some levels being reworked by collaborators.
- The codebase uses some unique approaches, like a "tick function instead of a behavior loop" and a new way to declare variables that Kaze believes is "way more transparent."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze's primary motivation is creative expression and fun: "I'm not trying to send a message at all, I just want to make the funny Mario."
- Development is a passion project done in his spare time: "I have a full time job, I can't spend that much time working on this right now. Unfortunately." This impacts the development timeline.
- He has strong opinions on game design, preferring intrinsic rewards and innovative concepts over simple collection mechanics: "I want the game that rewards me with finding cool shit. I want to see cool concepts, not extrinsic motivation like, oh, number go up."
- Kaze expresses frustration with frequent questions about release dates, emphasizing an "it's done when it's done" philosophy.
- He sometimes struggles with the technical aspects of streaming (OBS issues, mouse problems) and physical discomfort (neck pain).
- Kaze seems to value responsiveness in controls: "I feel like that would make this less responsive. You know what I mean? It's kinda nice how responsive this is."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific mention of "Badub" as the composer in this transcript. Kaze states all music is custom, and later mentions "Dumpy" (a composer for another project) and speculates about needing a new composer in the future, implying the current composer isn't named or he might be doing it himself.
- **Biobak (graphics artist, also referred to as Biomech/Biobank):**
    - Actively contributes design ideas: "I agree with Biobank's idea to make the soap go to the outside cages instead, though. I think that's a good change."
    - Kaze plans to delegate texture work to him for the power plant level: "I Will leave the textures to buy a bike [Biobak] but I will pick something for now that doesn't look completely awful at least."
    - Biobak also participates in community discussions, e.g., posting a "toaster speedrun."
- **Zeina (animations):**
    - Her role in animations is not detailed in this transcript.
    - She is mentioned in a personal context: "Zena has banished me here [to the basement]. She said I'm not allowed to come up unless it's to grab food."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Nata (also referred to as Mata):** Tasked with reworking the visuals for the "bomb cap factory" level. "Nata wants to rework it. He's gonna have it finished by the start of June." However, Kaze expresses some doubt about the progress: "he is four months overtime on something that he said would take him two weeks. So my confidence in this is not very high." Kaze also mentions paying Nata for this commission.
    - **Yoshi Milkman:** Contributing new custom sound effects. "Dude, we're going to have Yoshi Milkman's new sound soon, actually... Yoshi Milkman made so many new sounds for Mario 64 that are going to be pretty good. It's going to make the game feel a little more immersive."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Performance Optimization:** A major focus, exemplified by the coin rendering change (billboards to screen-space sprites) resulting in a 10-15% FPS boost in areas like "Bunny Brushworks."
- **Level Design (Power Plant - Course 11):**
    - Planned introduction of three new platform types: treadmills, dangling platforms, and collapsing grates, culminating in a final room that combines them.
    - A "weight platform" mechanic was developed during the stream, where one platform goes down as another goes up, based on Mario's position. This idea came from Biobak and was adopted: "I think we're going with that idea, yes. I like that."
    - Visual theme: Kaze is looking for an "abandoned power plant" vibe, referencing industrial imagery with pipe structures. He wants to avoid a "grainy" or "noisy" visual style.
- **Difficulty and Controls:** Aiming for a difficulty comparable to vanilla Mario 64, but acknowledging that the game's improved controls might make seemingly harder challenges more manageable. "Although, keep in mind, the controls in this work a lot better."
- **Black Boss (Course 11):** A boss fight where the boss is oil-slicked and rainbow-colored. Mechanics include running out of "soap" and dodging platforms. Kaze took Biobak's suggestion to change where the soap spawns.
- **New Star Model:** A new, non-transparent star model has been implemented, which Kaze believes is "a lot nicer than the transparent star in Vanilla Mar 64."
- **Implementing Platform Mechanics:** Kaze discusses the technical challenges of making dangling platforms move and interact realistically, considering animations vs. geo layouts. He also fine-tunes the physics of the weight platforms to make them feel responsive and useful for gameplay.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Date:** Kaze firmly states there are no release dates. "I'm not gonna guarantee any release dates... You're just gonna have to wait until it's done." He reiterates, "It's done when it's done."
- **Funding/Commissions:** Kaze mentions paying a collaborator: "See, the thing is, I paid him [Nata] to reorganize. He asked me for a commission because he needed some money." This is the only mention of financial transactions related to the game's development.
- **Marketing/Distribution:** No direct mentions of marketing plans or distribution strategies. The project appears to be a passion-driven endeavor shared via streams.

## Game Development Process
-   Kaze is actively working on a level for "Return to Yoshi's Island," specifically the "power plant area from the oil level."
-   Current development tasks include programming interactive level elements like platforms (elevators, treadmills), designing the level layout, and implementing enemy behaviors.
-   Significant time is spent on debugging and problem-solving, such as fixing non-functional platforms, addressing overlapping objects, and resolving texture scrolling issues.
-   Optimization is an ongoing concern, with mentions of efforts to improve frame rates (e.g., "We went from 43 to 45 fps to the range of 45 to 49 fps").
-   The process is iterative, involving trying out ideas, testing them, identifying issues, and refining the implementation.
-   Future work planned includes programming specific enemies like "amps" and "oil fuzzies" with unique mechanics.
-   Kaze mentions making "mini optimizations over the week" like inlining functions.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses a desire for streams to be free of constant release date inquiries: "I hope we can go a whole stream without people asking me for release dates every 15 minutes that would be pretty nice."
-   He reflects on his audience's shift towards more technical viewers: "I feel like a lot of programmers watch my channel now and not so much the casual audience ever since the source code revert."
-   He shows a pragmatic side regarding project selection, weighing passion against potential financial success for smaller projects: "I also don't want to work on hacks that are not gonna be a financial success So we do have to find something topical or something clickbaity like Mario 64 level but good."
-   Kaze has a structured approach to creating his YouTube video content, aiming for engaging narratives: "It's a five-step act first. We hook in the viewer...Then second We're gonna start building tension..."
-   He values the "vibe" of a level and finds it challenging to design without the final textures.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    -   Expected to provide textures and rework the visuals for the level Kaze is currently working on. Kaze states, "I'm gonna just pick random textures. I'll change them when I rework the level" and "I guess this whole area is gonna be ugly until biobank gets to it."
    -   Biobak seems to have input on visual elements, as Kaze mentions a discussion about some assets: "What will you replace them with biobank? Nothing they don't look good. Oh damn."
-   **Zeina (animations):**
    -   Mentioned in a personal context: "yeah Zena is finally out of my hair she is upstairs now and I'm downstairs isn't that nice."
    -   No direct mention of her contributing animations to "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this specific transcript.
-   **Other Contributors (from chat, actively involved in the stream):**
    -   **"Mario" (chat user):** Kaze consults with this user regarding texture choices: "Mario did you end up um picking any textures for this because otherwise I might have to try some more."
    -   **"Lila" (chat user):** Provides significant real-time technical suggestions, helps with debugging, and discusses technical implementation details with Kaze. Kaze frequently addresses Lila's input directly (e.g., "Okay, Lila, I believe you that this feature may work but I don't see how").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Level Design & Flow:**
    -   Designing the "power plant" area, focusing on platforming sequences involving elements like an elevator and a fast-moving treadmill. "This is the power plant area from the oil level so if you go inside the whole power generator gonna have to platform through it."
    -   Balancing difficulty and player experience, such as adjusting treadmill speed ("Mario's moving a little fast. I need to slow down a bit") and ensuring platforming sections are clearable but challenging.
    -   Addressing camera issues in tight spaces: "The problem here is that the camera also kind of sucks, right? I don't like that. You can't see Mario."
-   **Enemy Design & Mechanics:**
    -   Conceptualizing an "oil fuzzy" enemy inspired by "Touch fuzzy get dizzy" from Yoshi's Island.
    -   Planned effects for the oil fuzzy include making Mario slippery and uncontrollable, inducing visual distortions (wobbly screen, rainbow oil texture, FOV changes), slowing down audio, and potentially exaggerating Mario's squash and stretch animations.
    -   Planning to include "amp" enemies, possibly with dynamic lighting effects and movement along splines.
-   **Puzzle Elements:**
    -   Designing a Yoshi coin collectible that requires a specific interaction with a moving platform: "Imagine a Yoshi coin like somewhere up here... And the only way to get it would be to pull this platform down and then like hit it something like that."
-   **Technical Implementation Challenges:**
    -   Debugging platform behavior, such as an elevator not moving due to overlapping, identical platforms.
    -   Correcting texture scrolling bugs: "How is there a texture scroll here I literally removed it."
    -   Ensuring performance targets are met while adding new features.
-   **Aesthetics and "Vibe":**
    -   Struggling to define the level's atmosphere without final textures from Biobak: "So that's kind of really difficult for me because I can't really estimate the vibe of this, you know i'm kind of When I design a level I kind of have to go with the vibe."

## Business Aspects
-   **Financial Considerations for Projects:** Kaze mentions that some large projects (like an OOT remaster) would require "decent financial incentive." He also states a preference for smaller, pre-RTYI demo projects to be "a financial success" or at least "topical or something clickbaity."
-   **Pre-Release Demos for RTYI:** Plans to release "one or two more demos" before RTYI. The purpose is "so people can just Play test the physics and stuff." These demos might focus on popular Mario 64 levels, remade.
-   **YouTube Content Strategy:** Kaze consciously thinks about how to structure his videos for viewer engagement, aiming for content that might perform well algorithmically (e.g., "I'm working on a video on the Indra square root I think it might do okay on YouTube").
-   **Professional Work (GFB/Yogscast Games):** Kaze confirms he is "still actively working there" but is under NDA regarding specific projects: "I Am NOT allowed to tell what I am working on."

## Key Quotes
-   "I think we were programming all the platforms here right I just made this one here and now I need to program it this one should be pretty easy to program I think I'll program it as an object just so now she and everything works right off the bat." (Illustrates his object-oriented approach and iterative building).
-   "Honestly before our tyi's release. I do want to release one or two more demos where people can just Play test the physics and stuff... But I also don't want to work on hacks that are not gonna be a financial success So we do have to find something topical or something clickbaity." (Highlights the dual purpose of demos and his business-minded approach to smaller projects).
-   "Touch fuzzy get dizzy. Oh They should make Marsh super slippery so you can't stop yes, I like that... The weird Effect happens should you take damage to a Lot of squash and stretch... Mario's squash and stretch effects becomes 5x strong... Also increase the strength of the rainbow effect on the oil That will look wild." (Shows the creative brainstorming process for unique enemy mechanics in RTYI).

## Game Development Process
- The project "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is actively in development, with a significant portion of levels still needing completion (Kaze mentions "we need to finish like nine levels I think").
- Development involves a systematic bug-fixing process, tackling issues course by course. Kaze mentions having stopped at "course 4" in his bug-fixing pass.
- Asset integration from collaborators is a key activity, involving importing models, textures, and animations.
- A significant amount of time is spent on troubleshooting technical issues, including N64-specific bugs (e.g., "geo bone" system, sound computation), exporter problems (Blender plugins), and unexpected behaviors in custom code.
- Iteration is constant: new features or optimizations can break existing content, requiring ongoing maintenance ("we often break a lot of old stuff").
- Kaze mentions that RTYI might be "75% done" (a figure attributed to Lila, which Kaze contextualizes regarding her specific tasks) but focuses on the remaining work rather than a fixed percentage.
- Development includes creating new tools or plugins, like the "mini n64 object exporter" for Blender, to achieve specific animation goals.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes player "excitement" over raw "difficulty" in game design, aiming for engaging experiences rather than frustrating challenges.
- He reflects on past projects like "Lost Impact," acknowledging that his earlier, less compromising approach to implementing every idea sometimes led to suboptimal game design.
- Kaze believes in rapid prototyping and feedback for learning game design: "spam games... spending two weeks on each get a bunch of feedback."
- He expresses a desire for efficiency, both in personal habits (like disliking time-inefficient barbers) and in development (e.g., optimizing N64 matrix multiplications).
- Kaze has a clear vision for his future, seeing RTYI as a stepping stone and "advertisement" for an original IP he plans to develop and fund via Kickstarter.
- He shows a mix of confidence in his skills (e.g., Unreal Engine programming) and candidness about ongoing challenges and learning.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Feature Removal for User Experience:** The "instant pause exit" feature was removed "so that bad players don't accidentally exit levels," showing a consideration for broader player accessibility.
- **Balancing Difficulty and Engagement:** The airplane minigame is designed to be "difficult to control" but the mission itself "very easy to pass." The falling platform sequence is intended to "feel a lot more intense without actually making it more difficult."
- **N64 Technical Limitations:**
    - Constant struggle with optimizing for the N64, such as discussions around texture formats (IA4 vs. IA8, CI4, CI8) balancing detail, color depth, and memory/performance.
    - Fixing legacy N64 engine bugs like the "geo bone" issue to save on matrix multiplications.
    - A sound bug where distant actors' sounds play as if right on top of the camera due to issues in sound computation.
- **Tooling and Workflow Issues:**
    - Significant time spent troubleshooting Blender exporters (e.g., the "mini n64 object exporter" not working with a newer Blender version).
    - Losing texture data because it was "just bytes" and needing to recreate or find previous versions.
- **Iterative Design and Bug Fixing:**
    - "Random rock" spawner not working as intended, only spawning one type of rock.
    - Mario's shadow missing, warps being too small due to parameter overrides.
    - A "floor" collision bug discovered and fixed live.
    - Refining the airplane's dust trail effect involved tweaking combiners and textures.
- **Level Design Philosophy:** Kaze aims for "purpose" in level design, with some sections designed primarily as "a cool set piece that looks cool to look at." He's willing to adjust difficulty down if a section feels frustrating over solid ground.
- **Camera Considerations:** Aware of how camera placement can negatively impact platforming, Kaze makes adjustments to improve it.

## Business Aspects

## Game Development Process
- The game is in its later stages of development, with Kaze stating, "I think I'm almost done with the game, too."
- Specific progress mentioned: "only two areas are missing in this level and they're gonna be for the last star and the last few Yoshi coins."
- Overall remaining work: "we got four courses left after this and some side levels."
- The current focus is on an underground area for an oil rig level, involving platforming, collectibles (Yoshi coins, 8-bit pipe), and connecting different entrances.
- Kaze mentions an iterative approach: "We make a block out first and then we just put on a material and it will be something."
- Technical aspects like custom decompression are used to manage loading times on the N64 hardware: "we just load... And we decompress, which takes longer. And instead of waiting 16 frames, we just wait 8 frames. And the loading time is the same."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze reflects on his design intuition: "something about this feels weird anyone else feel like this feels weird right now maybe I'm being crazy."
- He has a pragmatic approach to coding behaviors: "I'd rather just have one parameter open like I do for 255 different behaviors I can hardcode because it is so rare that I want a special behavior like that."
- He is conscious of game difficulty based on past feedback: "usually when you make a romhack the criticism is always it's too difficult so i've gotten very wary of difficult i have been trying to make my games easier and easier."
- On his programming style (jokingly): "Mostly in English, but sometimes in C." This implies a high-level conceptual approach generally, with deep dives into C for optimization or specific needs.
- He acknowledges the impact of memory and context on his work: "so for me looking at this now this is this is talking about sports and finding a good sport but there is none that's what i think of when i see this and it will be forever like that i have way too good of a memory and it's cursing me."
- Kaze shows pride in the engine's capabilities: "I am thinking of porting just Delphino Plaza over to this engine and put it on the N64 and be like look the N64 could have played Mario Sunshine. Just to fuck with everyone. I think it'd be a very powerful showcase of the engine."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub**: The composer for the game.
    - "Badub is also making a song for the oil bus that's like this it's fit to the cutscene."
- **Biobak (referred to as "buy a bike" or "Biobank" in transcript errors)**: Handles graphics, textures, and props. Kaze defers to his artistic judgment.
    - "I guess that's gonna be up to buy a bike but I thought it looked good." (re: texture work/props)
    - "I'll leave the exact details to you [Biobak] but I'll definitely put this in for now." (re: glass material for a window)
    - "Biobank will justify it in post. Alright. I will try to somehow justify it with a few materials, but I will leave the majority to you." (re: materials for the underground area)
- **Zeina (Zena)**: Involved in animations and is an active participant in the stream chat. Kaze consults her on creative aspects.
    - "hello Zena do you mean to make some stuff just a monkey animations" (Kaze asking Zena about animation work).
- **Other Contributors**:
    - **Yoshi Milkman**: Created detailed surface sound effects. "surface sounds yeah I'm made by Yoshi Milkman he put a lot of work into making this perfect."
    - **Duke**: Composed a song. "Duke made a song for it [buzzer t2]."
    - **Unnamed freelance artist**: Kaze puts out a request for an artist to create an oil-based enemy ("Frizzlet" type). "Actually, yes, I do. There's a lot of assets I need. Do you want to make some? I have an enemy in mind for this."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Theming and Atmosphere**: Designing an underground oil rig area with "Big pipes and shit heavy metal leaking water boiling oil." Also, a concept for a transparent window to see platforms above.
- **Collectible Placement and Mechanics**:
    - "underground we need two Yoshi coins and the 8-bit pipe one Yoshi coin is going to be cleaning up another oil spot right here with a shell... and the other one is gonna be sliding down the slide and jumping into this crevice."
- **Platforming Design and Player Progression**:
    - "I need to make up a creative way to climb up here. I can't just do platforms." (Considering special platform types like dangling platforms or elevators).
    - Making certain platforms "slidey" to allow players to "practice the slidey skills beforehand."
- **Difficulty Balancing**: A significant consideration, especially for later levels.
    - "doesn't this jump feel a little too difficult? I mean, I know it's course 11... At some point, we have to draw a line."
    - He's trying to make the game easier based on past feedback for other ROM hacks.
- **Asset Creation and Selection**:
    - Kaze is looking for a freelancer to create a specific oil-based enemy.
    - He struggles with finding appropriate textures: "How is it so hard to find a good great texture?" and iterates on choices based on visual appeal and chat feedback ("Wow, this looks completely awful.").
- **Technical Limitations and Solutions**:
    - Designing within N64 texture limitations (e.g., 64x64 textures, specific formats). He advises a potential contributor: "just go with a full-res texture, whatever you think looks good, and then let me downscale it."
    - Rigging for characters/enemies has specific N64 requirements: "you should probably let me make the rig because N64 or Mario 64 has very specific requirements for the rig."

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube as a Promotional Platform**: Kaze actively uses his YouTube channel to showcase development and engage with the community.
    - "when you make a YouTube video you have to find the angle... I think I'm gonna frame it as like look with all this optimization artists have so much more freedom... it's gonna be the angle."
    - He monitors channel performance: "my youtube channel is on an upwards draft."
- **Audience Engagement**: Kaze is aware of viewer numbers and interaction on his streams.
    - "dude we have 64 viewers today that's nice we're making viewers on youtube again."
- **No Direct Monetization Mentioned**: The transcript does not contain information about funding, sales plans, or traditional release strategies for "Return to Yoshi's Island." The project appears to be passion-driven.

## Key Quotes
- "I think I'm almost done with the game, too." (Kaze on overall progress)
- "when you make a YouTube video you have to find the angle... I think I'm gonna frame it as like look with all this optimization artists have so much more freedom and we brought more artists on board which is you and now the game is epic and amazing because we all these optimizations it's gonna be the angle." (Kaze on his YouTube strategy and the benefits of optimization)

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is estimated to be 75-80% complete.
- Kaze is currently working on Course 11 of a planned 15 courses.
- Current development focus includes bug fixing across all levels to prepare for beta testing, and level design/implementation for new areas like the "OBB underground" (Oily Boily Bay underground).
- A significant portion of early development involved creating the custom game engine.
- Kaze follows self-imposed deadlines to maintain progress, having successfully met them for 14 consecutive days at the time of the stream.
- Key tasks include fixing bugs ("doors always so fucked up," culling issues, object update order), implementing new enemy behaviors (Chompy, oil puddle enemy), and level detailing (slides, hydraulic platforms, textures).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar expresses a strong work ethic, emphasizing his commitment to deadlines: "I started setting myself deadlines for stuff to work on right so I've done this for 14 days now and so far I fit every single deadline."
- He holds critical views on modern game design, stating: "I don't like modern game design. Modern game design is made for people that are depressed and just want to erase time. Not for people that want to go have an experience."
- Kaze is passionate about making RTYI a unique experience, even if it means it's niche: "I don't think a pc port of this game will ever exist... but I seriously doubt anyone is gonna have the skill to make a pc port of this or the patience because it's just gonna take so long."
- He values player experience and aims to make the game engaging without unnecessary time-wasting: "The game doesn't waste your time. That is important to me."
- He has a specific philosophy on game difficulty, prioritizing "cool" and engaging challenges over arbitrary difficulty.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Musician/Composer):** While not explicitly named in this transcript excerpt, Kaze mentions plans for the game's music: "I feel like when RTYI releases, I want to pay the musician to have the rights to the music and then release an album for RTYI." (The prompt implies Badub is the composer).
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** Kaze directly interacts with Biobak during the stream regarding a sail texture, discussing N64 texture limitations and optimization: "Can you send me like a blender file with just the sail then I can see what I can do... Does this work for you, Biobank? This is the most cursed texture resolution I've ever seen."
- **Lila (Animator):** Lila is working on "quaternion animations" which are critical for the game, particularly for fixing issues like door animations. Kaze states: "if Lila disappears before finishing the quaternion animations I will be so sad... until we have Lila's quaternion animation exporter... we cannot fix the doors." Lila was subject to a running gag about her "death" but appeared in chat during the stream. (The prompt mentioned Zeina for animations; this transcript refers to Lila for this role).
- **Other Contributors:**
    - No other direct RTYI development contributors are clearly identified with specific, ongoing roles in this transcript, though chat members provide feedback and ideas. SimpleFlips is mentioned in the context of a past commissioned mod, not RTYI.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **N64 Hardware Limitations:** A recurring major challenge is working within the N64's constraints, especially texture memory (4096 bytes for all combined textures) and resolution. Kaze frequently devises workarounds like "cursed texture resolutions" (e.g., 96x42).
- **Level Design (OBB Underground):** This area is designed as the "inner workings of the oil rig," featuring slides, numerous hydraulic press platforms, and an industrial aesthetic. The goal is to make it look like "a bunch of machines just working."
- **Enemy Design:** The "Chompy" has new actions and an HD model. An "oil puddle enemy" (similar to 3D World's "bits") is planned for the OBB underground.
- **Difficulty Balancing:** Kaze's approach is "I don't try to make the levels more difficult. I just put the threshold of how cool a jump has to be for it to be worth the difficulty lower." The game will also include mechanics to assist less skilled players.
- **Player Experience:** Decisions like making the file select a 3D level and avoiding going back to a hub on death (respawning at level start) are made to enhance player immersion and reduce frustration while maintaining impact.
- **Bug Fixing:** Significant time is spent on fixing bugs related to culling, object update order (especially for dynamic platforms like hydraulics), and animation-dependent objects like doors.

## Business Aspects
- **Future Game Development & Funding:** Kaze plans to develop a new, unrelated game in Unreal Engine and launch a Kickstarter campaign for it simultaneously with the release of RTYI: "simultaneously with the release of Return to Yoshi's Island we are going to start a Kickstarter for this game in Unreal Engine."
- **YouTube Monetization:** Kaze relies on YouTube ad revenue ("The ad revenue on YouTube is so high. I'm making bank around Christmas") and sponsorships (e.g., a Honkai Star Rail promotion: "I'm definitely taking that sponsorship").
- **RTYI Merchandising:** He expresses interest in releasing the RTYI soundtrack as an album, potentially on a physical N64-style cartridge, after securing rights from the musician.
- **Open Source:** RTYI's source code will be made public, though Kaze is skeptical about anyone successfully porting it to PC due to its complexity.

## Key Quotes
- "I'm going through all the levels from correspond to the last person fixing all the bugs that have appeared so that we can beta test every single level." (Shows current development stage and dedication to quality)

## Game Development Process
-   Currently focused on developing an "8-bit section" (oil-themed area) and has just finished work on a new enemy, "Fizz Oil," for this section.
-   Significant progress on "Course 4" (the Zoo level): It has been fixed up and is ready for beta testing once animations from Zeina are complete.
-   Ongoing process of fixing older levels that break due to new development work.
-   Kaze mentions working on a new doll remodel and significant improvements to the Chain Chomp model (new look, new eyes) for Course 4.
-   Volley (another character/enemy) is slated to receive new animations.
-   The team is using hashing tables for geo layouts, which provides significantly more space for models compared to traditional methods.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses a pragmatic approach to tool limitations, such as render bugs in Fast64, stating, "not much we can do about that we're just gonna have to live with it."
-   He shows humility about the game's reception: "it could be that the gameplay i'm designing is just bad you know i mean of course i'm hoping it's good but you never know."
-   He finds technical advancements freeing, such as the move to hashing tables for geo layouts: "Dude, that's actually so freeing that we have hashing tables now instead of normal geo layouts, because now we have so much more space for geos."
-   Reflects on past projects, e.g., clarifying that "Return to Yoshi's Island" was never a "Last Impact" sequel, and any such prior insinuation was "just to get clicks on a youtube video."
-   He acknowledges the challenge of N64-style low-poly modeling: "i'm not sure how i'm gonna model in drill n64 style low poly that seems like a challenge."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak:**
    -   Kaze mentions being mindful of Biobak's standards for polygon counts: "There are some polygons I can remove here, some sneaky triangles, before Biobank cusses me out."
    -   Kaze clarifies that he (Kaze) modeled the specific assets being worked on during the stream: "No, Biobank did not make any of this. I made this." This implies Biobak's role might be more related to quality control, art direction, or contributions to other assets.
-   **Zeina:**
    -   Zeina is responsible for animations. Her work is pending for "Course 4" (the Zoo level) to become fully functional and ready for beta testing: "all we're waiting now is for a few animations that zena's making and after that quiz 4 is once again functional."
    -   Mentioned as being "out with friends" during the stream.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Lila:** Appears to be a chat moderator. No direct creative contributions to the game mentioned in this transcript, but active in the community.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Enemy Design (Fizz Oil):**
    -   Conceptualized as an oil-based enemy inspired by "Fizz Lit" (an electric enemy, possibly from Nintendo).
    -   Behavior: Slimes around, then "whoops" into a puddle form that Mario can slide on.
    -   Visuals: Features three different eyes that change based on its state/actions.
    -   Interaction: Makes the ground slippery when in puddle form. Not intended to be super dangerous, more "vibe-giving" but can cause Mario to slide into hazards (e.g., boiling oil, off ledges).
    -   Defeat Mechanic: Can be killed with soap, which also serves as a hint for a potential boss mechanic. Drops coins upon defeat.
    -   Particle effects for death: Dark smoke particles to signify being "cleaned up."
-   **Level Design (Oil Area / 8-bit Section):**
    -   Features an oil drill Kaze models low-poly.
    -   Intends to add "oil clouds" and "dead fish" for environmental storytelling.
    -   Includes staircases that become dangerous with the Fizz Oil's slippery mechanic.
    -   Needs a "boiling oil environment effect" at the bottom of the area.
-   **Technical Challenges & Solutions:**
    -   Dealing with render bugs in Fast64 (a modeling tool).
    -   Implementing slippery surfaces dynamically by altering triangle properties on the fly when Mario is near a Fizz Oil, rather than modifying core engine code. Kaze prefers this as it's less invasive.
    -   Addressing clipping issues, for instance, with the Fizz Oil enemy on staircases.
    -   Debugging animation and texture issues for the Fizz Oil enemy.
-   **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    -   Considering nerfing the "Moonswim" mechanic due to it being "pretty OP."
    -   Star Select concept: "the idea with the star selects is that it shows mario traveling to the level."

## Business Aspects
-   **Marketing/Promotion:**
    -   Kaze acknowledges using social media (Twitter) for "clout": "I do wanna post that screenshot on Twitter, because it's gonna be insane clout."
    -   Admits to previously calling a project a "Last Impact sequel" specifically "to get clicks on a youtube video."
-   **Release/Distribution:**
    -   Explicitly states the game will be open-sourced: "I will definitely open sources like no worry This is guaranteed open source I want people to be ableable to maintain this code base after I leave the scene And I want other people to be able to make hex off of my engine."
-   **Financial Viability (of game dev):**

## Game Development Process
-   **Overall Progress**: The game is in an advanced stage of development. Kaze mentions "120 stars are finished now, but then we want 20 more stars." He also states, "Currently we have 12 levels done."
-   **Major Milestones**: Completion of entire areas off-stream ("Yeah, I guess I finished the whole area of stream and then also did the next area.") signifies substantial progress. The focus is shifting to remaining stars, overworld elements, and refining existing content.
-   **Development Stages**: The stream showcases work on a specific "cowboy" themed level, including NPC creation (Shy Guys, Monty Moles), asset refinement (textures, models, lighting), level layout, and narrative/mission brainstorming. Ripping and reworking assets from the original Mario 64 (e.g., Monty Mole) is also part of the process. Optimization for real N64 hardware is a continuous effort.

## Personal Insights
-   **Work Ethic**: Kaze describes himself as highly productive, humorously stating he avoids burnout because "I do not have a soul."
-   **Creative Motivation**: A strong desire "to tell stories in this game" is a key driver. He expresses satisfaction with his improved skills, noting, "I feel like recently I have a leveled up a lot of my skills and this level is like the first one that Has those applied and I'm pretty happy with it. It's very thematic everything is purposeful and I like that a lot."
-   **Game Design Philosophy**: Kaze values thematic consistency and purposeful design. He has strong opinions on technical aspects like FPS (preferring higher rates) and the importance of good controls. He also revises ideas if they feel "too dark" for a Mario game (e.g., the "Yoshi slave labor plot").

## Collaborator Information

-   **Biobak (graphics artist/modeler)**:
    -   Contributes 3D models, such as a "new mouse model" and a "head for the Yoshis."
    -   Kaze reviews and provides technical feedback on Biobak's assets, such as a pipe model ("Opinion on the pipe. Alright, let me look... No, no, no, we have to have lighting on...").
    -   Also referred to as "Biomech" and "Biobank" in the transcript.
-   **Zeina (animator/modeler)**:
    -   Creates 3D models, credited with making "the dragon" and manually creating rock assets ("Zena made those manually by hand").
    -   Also contributes character models, such as for Goombas ("Alright, Zeyna's also making a Goomba.").
    -   Also referred to as "Zeno" in the transcript.
-   **Other Contributors**:
    -   **Silas**: Mentioned for working on game mechanics: "Silas said he wanted to rework the squishiness function. He said he had a cool idea."
    -   **Leela (Kaze's wife)**: An active participant in the stream chat, providing commentary and engaging in banter with Kaze. While not a formal developer, her interactions are part of the stream's dynamic.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Level Theming and Narrative**: The cowboy level is designed with distinct areas (town, wilderness, train station) and specific narrative beats (treasure hunt, train robbery by Goombas, Monty Mole bank robbery). Kaze aims for levels where "everything is purposeful."
-   **NPC Design**: Creating themed NPCs (e.g., Cowboy Shy Guys, Toads, Monty Moles) with appropriate attire (cowboy hats, boots, vests) is a focus. This involves reusing and modifying existing models, as well as creating new assets.
-   **Technical Challenges**:
    -   Performance: "This level is running pretty well in 64. It's like almost 60 FPS." Optimization for real N64 hardware is a priority over emulators.
    -   Visuals/Geometry: Issues like "triangle overflow" are mentioned as sources of bugs. Lighting and material setup (e.g., for Shy Guys) require careful adjustment.
    -   Asset Integration: Deciding whether to use contributed assets (e.g., Zeyna's Goomba) and how to best fit them into the level.
-   **Iterative Design**: Level names are brainstormed and debated ("High Noon Hills," "Grandstand Badlands"). Asset designs, like the Shy Guy's vest, go through multiple iterations. Kaze mentions adjusting plot points: "the whole Yoshi slave labor plot is maybe a bit too dark... plot in Mario games is kind of very secondary."
-   **Gameplay Elements**: Designing specific boss fights (e.g., Goomba shootout, Monty Mole boss) and mission structures ("solve three secrets that will each give you a star").

## Business Aspects
-   **Streaming Strategy**: Kaze mentions streaming on both Twitch and YouTube simultaneously: "Because Twitch changed the rules recently, so now you're allowed to stream on both at the same time." This indicates an effort to maximize audience reach.
-   **IP Awareness**: He shows an awareness of Nintendo's stance on fan projects, joking about how quickly a "roaming Academy" (ROM hacking academy) would be shut down.
-   **Funding/Release**: No direct mentions of specific funding for this ROM hack or concrete release plans beyond continued development. ROM hacks are typically passion projects not sold commercially.

## Key Quotes
-   "I want to tell stories in this game." (Highlights a core creative drive for the project.)
-   "Yeah, of course this runs on real hardware. What do you think I do all the optimization for, for emulator?" (Emphasizes his commitment to N64 authenticity and performance.)
-   "I feel like recently I have a leveled up a lot of my skills and this level is like the first one that Has those applied and I'm pretty happy with it. It's very thematic everything is purposeful and I like that a lot." (Shows personal growth and pride in the quality of his current work.)

## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus:** Actively working on a "cowboy bar" / "milk bar" saloon level, including layout, NPC dialogue ("Howdy partner..."), and secret rooms ("chalky milk room").
- **Mechanics Development:** Refining Dry Bones enemy behavior, making them stronger (immune to jumps, requiring ground pounds) with a lore justification (milk consumption).
- **Level Design & Iteration:**
    - Planning future course themes (Courses 13, 14, 15), with a "space station" idea being favored.
    - Reworking existing content: Course 2 ("Divine Dino Domain") is being changed to include more platforming, replacing a "lame as fuck" water raft section.
    - Considering overall game structure: Discussing themes for side levels (mushroom forest, arctic toy train level).
- **Technical Exploration:** Considering a new N64 tech for decompressing songs at runtime, potentially for a full OST on cartridge.
- **Asset Integration:** Importing textures (e.g., from XPM), working on level geometry in Blender, and integrating them into the game.
- **Story Development:** Mentions a need to "overhaul the story of this game a little bit too," noting "The whole slavery plot is a little bit dark for a Mario game."

## Personal Insights
- **Creative Philosophy:** "What would be the point of an existence where you don't create? That's like the whole purpose of the human soul."
- **N64 Limitations as a Creative Constraint:** "I'm not interested in ever using more than 8MB just because the original N64 games didn't do it. And going beyond the original limitations is just kinda against the spirit of the challenge."
- **Inspiration Sources:** Level themes for "Lost Impact" came from dreams, and he suggests a similar approach for RTYI: "We should just go with crazy themes or just like random things that come to me in my dreams."
- **Views on Modding Ethics:** Believes if you hack a game without consent, you should accept others hacking your hack without your consent.
- **Utilitarian View of AI:** Sees AI (like ChatGPT) as a "very good tool" and "a better google" for tasks like code generation or information retrieval, while acknowledging its limitations.
- **Dismissal of Established Theories:** Expresses skepticism towards conventional color theory ("it's so arbitrary who decided that the color wheel was like the colors that go well together") and music theory ("Why the fuck is it 12 notes").

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Banduke):** Composer. Kaze praises his music ("Everything Banduke makes a banger, true"). Plans to pay him for the RTYI OST if the physical cartridge release happens.
- **Biobak:** Graphics artist. Kaze mentions using Biobak's "window technique" and considers his "combiner" for textures, though sometimes opts for different solutions based on specific needs.
- **Zeina:** Animator/General Contributor. Actively participates in chat. Kaze confirms Zeina is working on Dry Bones animations ("Skel sounds good").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **XPM:** Texture artist whose textures are being used extensively in the saloon level.
    - **Khaki Dev:** A fellow modder whose code Kaze has interacted with.
    - **Sylar:** Mentioned as working on a "new function."
    - **Cozys:** Creators of the "MiniOMG property exporter" plugin.
    - **Pixel Empire:** The platform used for Kaze's merchandise.
    - **Lachlan:** A friend or associate Kaze mentions in relation to the milk bar.
    - An unnamed individual offered to make cactus models but did not follow through.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Saloon Level Design:**
    - **Concept:** A cowboy-themed milk bar with a secret "chalky milk" room for "bad guys" (Snifits, Shy Guy).
    - **Gameplay:** Players overhear conversations for clues, find a hidden doorknob to the secret room.
    - **Layout:** Detailed planning of bar section, tables, stage, secret room placement, and an upper level with a staircase.
    - **Aesthetics:** Concern about camera claustrophobia, adding swinging saloon doors, choice of floor and wall textures, lighting effects (additive blending for windows).
- **Enemy Mechanics (Dry Bones):**
    - **Challenge:** How to make Dry Bones in this area distinct and tougher.
    - **Solution:** They are immune to standard jumps due to "strong bones" from lifelong milk consumption (lore). This will be conveyed through NPC dialogue.
- **Level Theme Generation:**
    - **Challenge:** Finding "inspired" themes for later courses (13, 14, 15) and side levels, feeling some initial ideas were "uninspired."
    - **Approach:** Drawing inspiration from dreams or "cool shit," similar to "Lost Impact." Ideas considered include a music level, an oversized casino, a comic book city, a dream level (childhood experiences), and a space station (current preference).
- **Technical Constraints:** Adherence to N64 limitations (e.g., 8MB ROM size, managing polygon counts).
- **Dialogue:** Using ChatGPT as a tool to help generate cowboy-style dialogue for NPCs.
- **Reworking Content:** Decision to overhaul Course 2 to improve its platforming elements and remove a less engaging section.
- **Platforming Focus:** Acknowledges a lack of "cool platforming sections" and aims to add more, including reworking Course 2 to introduce "fling vines."

## Business Aspects
- **Physical OST Release:** "I'm thinking maybe it would be cool if we made a cartridge with all the RTYI songs and sold that separately... we're gonna sell it for like a hundred dollars or something with a box and like a custom cartridge and like an instruction booklet and stuff like that."
    - This is positioned as a "cool souvenir," with the digital ROM and soundtrack remaining free.
- **Merchandise:** Selling stickers (e.g., "skill issue," "Peach's Fury," "HA sticker," "Just program well") through Pixel Empire.
- **Funding/Paying Collaborators:** "I would like to pay a lot of artists that help with this game. I'm definitely gonna pay Barduke for the OST if we do end up making that cartridge."
- **Legal Considerations (Merch):** Briefly questions the legal responsibility for merch designs, relying on Pixel Empire's assurances.

## Key Quotes
- "I'm not interested in ever using more than 8MB just because the original N64 games didn't do it. And going beyond the original limitations is just kinda against the spirit of the challenge. At that point, why not just make a game for emulator?" - On development philosophy and N64 authenticity.
- "There's going to be a secret room where a bunch of bad guys sit around the table drinking chalky milk... We got caught chalky handed. Let's get out of boys or something like that." - On a specific, quirky design idea for the saloon.
- "Usually all the themes in Lost Impact were just things that literally came to me in a dream. That's probably why they feel so inspired to me. And I think we should use that approach for the level themes [in RTYI]." - On his source of inspiration for level design.

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The "Spirit of the Challenge":** Explore Kaze's decision to strictly adhere to N64 hardware limitations (like the 8MB ROM size) and how this constraint fuels or hinders creativity in "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- **Dream-Inspired Design:** Delve into the process of translating dream concepts and "cool shit" into tangible level designs and game mechanics, and how this compares to more conventional design approaches.
- **Collaboration Dynamics in ROM Hacking:** Discuss how Kaze works with contributors like Badub (music), Biobak (graphics), and Zeina (animation) in a distributed, often informal, ROM hacking environment. How are creative differences resolved, and how does their input shape the final game?
- **The "Chalky Milk" Philosophy:** Unpack the thought process behind unique and humorous game elements like the "chalky milk" secret room. How much of RTYI's design is driven by Kaze's personal sense of humor and desire to subvert player expectations?
- **From Hobby to Physical Product:** Investigate the motivations behind creating and selling physical merchandise (OST cartridge, stickers) for a free ROM hack. What does this signify about the project's evolution and Kaze's relationship with his audience?
- **Evolving Narrative:** Discuss the decision to overhaul the game's story, moving away from "the whole slavery plot," and explore the new narrative direction planned for RTYI and its intended tone.

## Game Development Process
-   Active development on multiple significant levels, including a new Western-themed saloon area and a substantial rework of the pirate ship level (Course 5/"Chris5").
-   The development follows an iterative cycle: assets and level designs (often from collaborators like Biomech) are reviewed, tested, and technically adapted by Kaze for N64 compatibility.
-   A strong emphasis is placed on optimizing for N64 hardware, involving constant adjustments to texture formats, polygon counts, rendering techniques, and overall performance.
-   Kaze is developing a custom, optimized engine for the game, which he plans to release publicly alongside the hack.
-   Debugging and troubleshooting, particularly when integrating new or revised assets, form a significant part of the daily development work. For example, Kaze spends a considerable amount of time diagnosing and fixing a crash after importing Biomech's updated pirate ship model.
-   Levels are being revisited and overhauled; the pirate ship, originally made "three years ago," is undergoing a complete visual and structural rework.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze highly values creating a specific "vibe" and atmosphere in levels, often discussing lighting, textures, and music to achieve the desired mood (e.g., a "dark" saloon, a "ghost ship").
-   He expresses clear opinions on game design principles, such as the appropriate density of NPCs, the importance of intuitive puzzle design ("This is good because we are showing a cool idea to the player... Difficulty here is unnecessary"), and maintaining visual consistency.
-   Frustration is evident with N64 technical limitations and the repetitive nature of some tasks (e.g., fixing texture formats, dealing with captchas), but he also shows dedication to overcoming these hurdles.
-   He appears to enjoy the creative problem-solving aspects of development, particularly in making ambitious visual ideas work on the N64.
-   Kaze maintains an open development process by live-streaming his work and interacting with his audience, incorporating their feedback or reactions into his commentary.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Biomech (referred to as "Biobak" or "Biomech"):** The primary 3D artist and level designer for significant parts of the game. Biomech is responsible for the extensive rework of the pirate ship level (Course 5), providing new models, textures, lighting, and level layouts. Kaze meticulously reviews Biomech's detailed changelogs and assets, making necessary technical adjustments (e.g., texture formats, polygon optimization, layer assignments) to ensure N64 compatibility and performance. The stream heavily features Kaze going through Biomech's Blender file and list of changes.
-   **Badoob (Badoob):** The composer for the game. Kaze mentions waiting for a saloon theme from Badoob and later reviews a submitted track, providing feedback that it's "too much like the zoo song" and not quite the vibe he's looking for, but notes Badoob is already working on changes.
-   **Zeina (Zayn):** Mentioned briefly in the context of animations ("zayn i just scrubbed last week the hell how are you doing this"), suggesting ongoing work on animations for the game.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    *   "Someone on Twitter": Sent Kaze a cactus model used in the Western-themed level.
    *   Kaze also mentions sharing his custom engine with "some of the other hackers" in the community.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **NPC Density and Dialogue:** A recurring challenge is balancing the desire for lively, populated environments with the practical difficulty of writing meaningful dialogue for numerous NPCs and potential performance impacts on the N64. Kaze states, "it's very difficult to come up with good text for like a million npcs."
-   **Lighting and Atmosphere:** Significant effort is invested in creating specific moods using lighting (e.g., dark saloons, shiny lamps on the pirate ship, glowing goo). This often requires custom solutions and careful management of N64 rendering capabilities, such as avoiding expensive clear colors.
-   **N64 Technical Limitations:** A core challenge is making modern game design ambitions fit N64 constraints. This includes:
    *   Texture management (formats like CI4, RGBA16, IA8, resolution limits, and memory).
    *   Polygon budgets ("A thousand seven hundred triangles only. That's good.").
    *   Rendering performance (dealing with overdraw, Z-sorting issues for transparent or layered objects, and the performance cost of certain effects).
    *   Kaze frequently has to modify collaborator Biomech's detailed models and textures to work efficiently.
-   **Level Reworks and Iteration:** Older levels are being significantly overhauled. The pirate ship (Course 5) is a prime example, with Biomech providing a near-total redesign that Kaze then integrates and refines.
-   **Gameplay Mechanics & Puzzles:** New interactive elements are discussed, such as a jail cell that visually fills up as players capture outlaws, a bouncy plank on the pirate ship potentially leading to a collectible, and environmental puzzles like a pushable shelf revealing a secret. Kaze emphasizes making puzzles intuitive rather than overly difficult.
-   **Visual Cohesion:** Kaze is attentive to maintaining a consistent art style, critiquing textures or models that "look very out of style" or don't fit the established aesthetic.

## Business Aspects
-   **Open Source Release:** Kaze explicitly states his intention to release the game and its custom engine as open source: "yeah yeah when i release this hack my engine will be public i'll make the hack open source like all of it at the same time."
-   **Community Engagement:** While not direct funding, Kaze engages with his audience through streaming (Twitch and YouTube simultaneously), sharing progress, and has a "Kaze Clips YouTube channel." This serves as a form of community building and informal marketing.
-   No relevant information found regarding traditional funding, sales plans, or formal marketing campaigns (as expected for a ROM hack).

## Key Quotes
-   "this game on purpose doesn't have a clear color because applying the clear color takes around three milliseconds which is like 10 percent of the render time of a frame so doing a clear color is gonna be very very expensive for you at 64." (Highlights the deep technical considerations and N64-specific optimizations).
-   "Biobank has been hyping this one up for a while... Oh god, this is so different. Holy shit, everything is different. How did he do it?... first of all, dude, this is fucking sick looking. Look at this. Oh my god." (Showcases Kaze's reaction to Biomech's significant contributions and the iterative nature of their collaboration on level design).
-   "yeah yeah when i release this hack my engine will be public i'll make the hack open source like all of it at the same time." (Clearly states the plan for the project's release and its contribution back to the modding community).

## Potential Interview Topics

I changed the Shy Guys a little bit..."). A chatter named "Biobank" (highly likely to be Biobak) also actively contributes ideas during the stream, such as a pun-based dialogue line ("We do things the murky way" -> "milky way").
- **Zeina (animator):** Mentioned as being responsible for animations (e.g., "pirate ship is mostly done. I'm just missing a few jelly block animation frames" likely by Zeina) and was expected to provide 3D models, specifically "milk bottles" for the saloon level, though Kaze notes, "I guess she forgot."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **LibDragon dev(s):** Kaze mentions occasionally talking to a developer from the LibDragon project about N64 optimizations and sharing ideas.
    - **James Lambert:** Mentioned for creating a "very cool technical thing" on N64 (Megatech), though not directly a contributor to RTYI.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Saloon Secret Room & Minecart Chase:** A significant portion of the stream focuses on designing a secret "choccy milk" speakeasy in the saloon, leading to a minecart chase sequence through an adjoining cave. This involves brainstorming:
    - The narrative hook (illegal choccy milk).
    - The trigger for the chase (Shy Guys getting caught and fleeing).
    - Mechanics of the chase (Mario jumping between 3 separate minecarts, dodging projectiles from Snuffits).
    - The level layout for the cave and minecart track.
    - How to end the sequence (discussion around a fall vs. reaching an end platform, with a decision leaning towards a fall and then a fight).
- **Player Experience & Control:** Kaze is concerned with ensuring intuitive gameplay and preventing exploits. For example, deciding that landing on minecart tracks (off the carts) should result in "death" to keep the chase focused. He also debates camera controls (current third-person vs. full first-person).

    - **Rendering issues:** Problems with vertex shading (carpet), lighting flags on textures (barrels), and general rendering bugs with Glideon (e.g., on the minecart rails).
    - **Asset integration:** Adjusting combiners on Shy Guy models due to environment color issues, finding suitable textures for the cave.
    - **Physics:** Implementing generic net physics.
- **Maintaining Mario Feel:** Kaze emphasizes keeping the gameplay platforming-based, stating, "I like it to still be platforming based is the thing. I don't really want to give Mario a gun."
- **Discoverability:** Designing hidden elements, like the secret saloon door, to be discoverable through NPC dialogue and environmental clues.

## Business Aspects
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" will be released for **free** and will be **open source**.
- Kaze has considered a potential monetization strategy: selling a physical version of the game's Original Soundtrack (OST) on a cartridge, complete with a box and instruction manual, marketed as a "souvenir."
- He explicitly states, "I actually think video games should not be monetized off of video game sales. I think that's a stupid concept."
- Kaze mentions that Nintendo has taken down over 70 of his videos, impacting his channel's visibility and perceived as "sabotage."

## Key Quotes
- "The background's gonna make this level go from like 9 out of 10 to 10 out of 10." (Illustrates dedication to polish)

    - Appears to be in the same physical location or working environment as Kaze during the stream, as Kaze comments on noise she's making: "Oh, what is that ungodly noise? What the fuck is Xena doing up there?" and later "no dude zana you were so loud earlier you were at the furnace earlier."
- **Other Contributors:** No other specific game development contributors are clearly identified or their roles detailed in this transcript.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Red Coin Stars:** Changed so they no longer eject the player from the stage, considered a "necessary change" for player experience.
- **100 Coin Stars:** Kaze states, "I don't think 100 coin stars should be in this game." Red coins, if they existed, would also not boot the player out.
- **Minecart Sequence (Cowboy Level):**
    - **Initial Concept:** Shy Guys/Snifits in minecarts, Mario jumps between them.
    - **Challenge:** Swapping between minecarts proved "really, really difficult" for the player.
    - **Iteration 1:** Mario on one large minecart platform, with Shy Guys in smaller carts.
    - **Challenge:** Player potentially getting squished on tracks or falling off unfairly.
    - **Iteration 2 (Solution):** Implemented a cutscene for the Shy Guys jumping into their carts to control the setup and prevent the player from jumping in too early or getting unfairly hit. The player's minecart movement is then managed relative to the Shy Guy carts.
    - **Ongoing Challenge:** Fine-tuning the speed, spacing, and behavior of the minecarts to make the chase engaging and fair. Debugging issues like carts crashing or Mario falling off.
- **Camera Control:**
    - Issue with doors letting the camera through: "I feel like doors should never let the camera through."
    - Debugging camera clipping during cutscenes, requiring adjustments to room geometry and camera flags.
- **Character Movement & Physics:**
    - Addressed "jittery motions" of characters by decoupling face angle from move angle.
    - Implemented and debugged an "align to surface" function for Mario.
    - Strong emphasis on proper analog stick control for movement.
- **Sound Design:** Implemented new sound effects for actions like ground pound jump (from Mario Kart 64), spin jump (Melee-inspired), and a new falling sound, actively seeking feedback from chat.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization & Finances:**
    - Kaze is exploring Twitter monetization: "Dude I actually looked into Twitter monetization today It looks like if I could monetize my Twitter account, that'd be like $200 a month."
    - Considering hiring a social media manager, possibly on a revenue-sharing basis.
    - Experiencing issues with PayPal: "I'm I'm getting PayPal cocked they refused to let me use my PayPal money."
- **Content Strategy (YouTube):**
    - Believes "Making level previews on YouTube is just not a good business model."
    - Prefers making "technical videos" for better engagement/viability.
- **Distribution:** No specific plans for release or distribution of "Return to Yoshi's Island" are mentioned in this transcript, beyond the general context of ROM hacking.

## Key Quotes
- "The crazy part is the game doesn't look like it can run on an N64 but it does." (Highlights technical ambition and achievement)
- "Okay, but swapping between Minecarts is really, really difficult. Holy shit. I can't expect players to do that. How do we make this better?" (Illustrates the iterative design process and focus on playability)
- "I want to make sure no one gets stuck ever. Luigi mode. We call it little brother mode, but you know, you are the little brother." (Humorous take on accessibility, though later ideas are more serious)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Philosophy of Player Experience:** Explore Kaze's reasoning behind design choices like the red coin star change and his strong opinions on analog controls. How does he define "good" player experience in a challenging ROM hack?
- **Iterative Design in Action - The Minecart Saga:** A deeper dive into the multi-stage redesign of the minecart sequence. What were the core problems at each stage, and how did he arrive at the solutions? What does this reveal about his problem-solving approach?
- **Collaborative Dynamics:** How does Kaze manage and integrate contributions from artists like Biobak and Zeina? What is the workflow like, and how are creative differences or technical challenges resolved in a team setting for a ROM hack?
- **Pushing the Limits of N64 Decompilation:** Beyond the general statement, what specific technical innovations or workarounds is Kaze most proud of in "Return to Yoshi's Island" that allow it to achieve visuals or mechanics not typically seen on the N64?
- **The Independent Creator's Journey:** Discuss the balance between passionate game development and the practicalities of monetization (Twitter, PayPal issues) and content strategy (YouTube). How does he sustain his work?

## Game Development Process
-   The game is in a significant development phase, focusing on overhauling core mechanics, notably a complete rewrite of Mario's collision system and implementation of a new "step function" for movement.
-   Kaze mentions being in "course 12" and having "like three and a half levels left, basically," indicating substantial progress in level creation.
-   Specific missions, like the "minecart mission," are being finalized and showcased, though new systems are still introducing bugs (e.g., a crash during the minecart mission demo due to the new collision functions).
-   Development is iterative, with new systems being actively worked on, tested, and refined live on stream (e.g., the collision system was started "yesterday").
-   Work includes asset integration and refinement, such as setting up a bulletin board with textures made by Zeyna and designing NPC appearances.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze believes Mario 64's movement design is "awesome," but the level design often lacks "placeness" (a distinct theme or vibe), which he aims to improve in "Return to Yoshi's Island."
-   He reflects on past projects, like "SM64 Madness," noting community perception about its "soul" despite its rapid development (two weeks).
-   Kaze values creating levels with a strong identity and theme, stating, "I think for places it's very important that the level has like a theme. A vibe. Something that you can identify the level with."
-   He expresses a desire for the new collision system to be "much better than any other Mario 64 thing."
-   He has a pragmatic approach to using existing assets if suitable: "we might as well just take assets from Google who cares... it'd hypocritical for us to like hack roms and then pretend like it's completely wrong to take assets."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:**
    -   Mentioned as "making a lot of music" for the project.
    -   Kaze defers questions about music releases to Baduk ("you have to ask the dupe whenever he feels like it").
-   **Biobak:**
    -   Credited with "making a lot of stuff" for the hack, implying significant graphical or asset contributions.
-   **Zeina:**
    -   A key collaborator, physically present (upstairs in the same house during the stream).
    -   Contributes animations (e.g., the new spin jump animation, which Kaze then "polished").
    -   Creates textures and art assets (e.g., drawings for the bulletin board, textures for it, potentially designs for Koopa accessories like glasses and a cane).
    -   Engages in direct, often humorous, back-and-forth with Kaze during the stream regarding assets and game elements.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **CDI and Zelda:** Mentioned as having provided help for Kaze's previous project, "Zelda Missing Link" ("I did have help from CDI and Zelda, which really helped the project."). It's not explicitly stated they are contributing to "Return to Yoshi's Island," but they are past collaborators.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Collision System Overhaul:** A major undertaking to "rewrite Mario's collision entirely" for a more robust and improved feel. The new system uses binary searches, raycasts, and move verifications. Current challenges include bugs like incorrect animations on rollout and non-functional ceiling bonks.
-   **Spin Jump Animation:** The decision to use Mario's Down-B animation from Smash Melee for the spin jump, as the original "twirl looked bad" and the Melee version felt like the "closest you have to an official version... from 1996."
-   **Level Entrance Design (Monty Mole Boss):** Iterative design process for accessing a new area. Initial idea of a simple hole was dismissed. Explored options like a fake cardboard cutout boulder before settling on a breakable rock, potentially requiring a "bomb cap." The challenge is to make it discoverable but not overly obvious.
-   **NPC Design (Koopa Bankier):** Detailed discussion on creating a "Wild West bank employee" Koopa, including considerations for its appearance (baldness as a "vibe," beard style, glasses, clothing).
-   **Rendering and Technical Art:** Challenges with default material settings causing rendering issues ("Dude, I hate that this defaults to environment... it actually will render wrong"). Implementing "fog-shaded decals" and dealing with "coordinate quantization" for poster rendering.
-   **Dynamic Text Boxes:** A new feature where text boxes automatically resize to fit the dialogue content, showcased as a quality-of-life improvement.
-   **Yoshi Coins:** Replacing 100-coin stars, indicating a change in collectible philosophy.

## Business Aspects
-   Kaze acknowledges a "free dollar donation" from a viewer, suggesting informal monetary support via streaming.
-   He mentions that a video about the new complex collision system wouldn't be "marketable," indicating some awareness of content appeal, but this doesn't seem to drive core development decisions for the game itself.
-   No formal marketing, structured funding, or specific release/distribution plans were discussed.

## Key Quotes
-   "So, I had an idea yesterday to just rewrite Mario's collision entirely. What you're seeing right now is the rewritten collision... Once my new collision system is done, dude, this game will be so nice collision-wise, I think. Much better than any other Mario 64 thing."
-   "Yeah, I don't think Mario 64 is that great either, except for the movement design. Like the level design itself is not great, but the movement is like awesome. So that's the part I want to change."
-   "I think for places it's very important that the level has like a theme. A vibe. Something that you can identify the level with."
-   "We have like three and a half levels left, basically. We're in course 12 here."

## Potential Interview Topics
-   **The Philosophy Behind Rewriting Core SM64 Systems:** Explore Kaze's motivations for overhauling fundamental elements like collision, the specific shortcomings he aimed to address, and the technical innovations in his new system.
-   **Achieving "Placeness" in Level Design:** Delve deeper into his concept of "placeness." How does this philosophy guide level creation in "Return to Yoshi's Island," and how does he differentiate his approach from the original Mario 64 levels?
-   **The Collaborative Dynamic with Key Contributors (Zeyna, Baduk, Biobak):** Discuss how the creative process works with his team. How are tasks distributed, feedback exchanged, and a cohesive vision maintained, especially with Zeyna being in close proximity?
-   **Balancing Homage and Innovation:** How does Kaze decide which elements of Mario 64 to preserve, enhance, or completely reinvent for "Return to Yoshi's Island"? What's his approach to player expectations for a "Mario 64" experience?
-   **The Journey of a Prolific ROM Hacker:** Kaze's reflections on his evolution as a game creator, from earlier projects like "SM64 Madness" to the ambitions of "Return to Yoshi's Island," and how his design principles have developed.

## Game Development Process
- Currently focused on the "cowboy level" (also referred to as "mole hideout"), specifically implementing Monty Mole enemy behavior and a boss fight.
- Significant off-stream progress is made; the stream often shows debugging and refinement.
- The game is stated to be approximately 80% complete, with "three more main courses and two side levels and one bowser level" remaining.
- Key development tasks include physics calculations for projectiles, AI behavior scripting, level scripting, and boss encounter design.
- A major milestone achieved is a completely new, more stable collision system, replacing the original Mario 64 one.
- Iterative development is evident, with Kaze working through bugs (e.g., rock spawning, moles shooting offset) and refining mechanics live.
- Star 1 and 2 for the current level are considered done, with work progressing on Star 3 ("Goomba imposter tower").

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong opinions on game mechanics, such as his disdain for the original SM64 collision system ("It is unusable") and his pride in his custom solution ("it's so much more stable").
- He has a nuanced philosophy on bugs: "if there's a bug in Mario 64 that you only encounter if you do it on purpose, I'll leave it in the game. But if it can happen on accident, I'll remove it." He specifically wants to keep BLJ possible if he can.
- Kaze values player experience and feeling over literal interpretations of critique: "I try to figure out like what the person was feeling that's wrong... seeing if I can address their feeling instead of their actual critique."
- He is ambitious, not only in overhauling core game systems but also in his future plans to develop an original commercial game.
- He is candid about the development process, including frustrations (e.g., with physics math) and moments of discovery.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific mention of Badub or their contributions in this transcript segment.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No specific mention of Biobak or their contributions in this transcript segment.
- **Zeina (animator):**
    - Her animation work is implied as crucial for game polish. Kaze notes a "to do: add animations" for the Monty Moles, stating, "to effectively make this faster I think I need the animations."
    - A playful comment suggests "quaternion animations" are a known, perhaps complex, task ("Lila will only vote for you if you promise that you will force a few programmers to finish quaternion animations").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **CX links:** Kaze asks, "Hello CX links, we already got any OST wishes today," which might imply CX links is involved with music selection or contribution, but their role is not clearly defined.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **New Collision System:** A major decision to replace SM64's collision entirely due to its perceived instability. This new system is a point of pride but also led to unintended consequences like removing BLJ initially.
- **Projectile Physics:** Kaze struggled with calculating the Y-velocity for projectiles (rocks thrown by Moles), initially trying ChatGPT for help before solving it with manual physics equations. This involved understanding motion under gravity.
- **Boss Fight Design (Monty Moles):**
    - Initial ideas involved a set number of moles that get faster, or a survival wave. These were iterated upon due to concerns about being "boring" or visually cluttered.
    - The chosen design involves moles popping out of random holes, requiring the player to react. Kaze specifically scripted this behavior: "they pick a random hole to come out of."
    - Thematic consistency is considered (e.g., "No, I don't like hard hats, because this is a cowboy level").
- **Bug Fixing & Iteration:** Constant process of identifying and fixing bugs, such as moles shooting with an offset, interaction issues, and incorrect coin spawning.
- **Balancing Intentional vs. Accidental Bugs:** Kaze aims to remove bugs that hinder player experience accidentally but is open to keeping bugs that players seek out intentionally (like BLJ).
- **RAM Management:** Mentioned removing collision on a bridge in the cowboy level "for RAM reasons for now," indicating technical constraints of the N64 platform.

## Business Aspects
- **Future Original Game & Kickstarter:** Kaze explicitly states, "I'm planning like alongside the release of return to your silent I'll probably launch like a Kickstarter for my own game and then transition to working on that and then hopefully I can hire some other rom hackers to work on it with me actually."
- **Experience with Sponsorships:** Kaze recounts a negative experience with a company that sponsored an ad for a handheld device, indicating his awareness of his channel's value ("usually for an ad you get like $3,000"). This provides context for his potential approach to funding future projects.
- No direct marketing or distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" itself were mentioned in this transcript, which is typical for a ROM hack.

## Key Quotes
- "I made a completely new collision system. I said, fuck Mario 64's collision. It is unusable. We have our completely own collision system now. And it's so much more stable." (Highlights technical ambition and improvement over the original)
- "I'm not trying to prevent the BLJ. It's more so that just by making more stable physics, it just so happened to remove BLJ. And I consider that a bad thing, actually. Ideally, BLJ would still be possible." (Shows his design philosophy regarding iconic game mechanics and emergent play)
- "I mean the levels are left to make after this three more main courses and two side levels and one bowser level we're like 80% of the way there" (Provides a clear status update on the project's overall completion)
- "I'm planning like alongside the release of return to your silent I'll probably launch like a Kickstarter for my own game and then transition to working on that..." (Indicates future aspirations beyond ROM hacking)

## Game Development Process
- Currently focused on developing "Course 12," a mine-themed area, which involves significant restructuring and iterative design based on playtesting and Kaze's evaluation of level quality.
- The project is substantially progressed, with Course 12 being "12 out of 15" planned courses.
- Kaze's workflow generally involves establishing level design and geometry first, followed by detailed visual work and polish.
- Key activities include 3D modeling, level layout, implementing gameplay mechanics (e.g., wobbly platforms, planned minecarts), enemy placement, and collectible (Red Coin) distribution.
- Technical aspects include fixing compiler warnings, working with emulators, UV unwrapping, and performance optimization (e.g., Z-sorting geometry, considering array-based collision).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly self-critical of his work, willing to make "big restructures" if he feels a course is "not very good."
- He has a clear vision for his target audience, aiming for "a weird nerd that's been playing Nintendo games in his basement for 25 years," contrasting it with games designed for broader, more casual audiences.
- Kaze holds strong opinions on game design, particularly disliking mechanics that involve waiting (common in some boss fights) and valuing player skill and freedom. He prefers games that offer "new concepts, new ideas."
- He expresses frustration with technical limitations or persistent issues (e.g., a specific compiler warning, emulator quirks) but is determined to fix them.
- He appreciates directness and utility in game mechanics, critiquing games like Portal 2 for being "too meta with the jokes" and a "cannibalization of Portal 1."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No direct mention of Badub or specific composer collaboration in this transcript. Kaze does ask for "OST wishes," indicating music is a consideration.
- **Biobak:** Mentioned as a graphics artist who will likely do a "reworking" of visual elements, potentially replacing Kaze's placeholder assets (like a fireplace model) with his own, more polished work. This suggests Biobak handles later-stage visual refinement.
    - Quote: "There's also a good chance that during the reworking, Biobank is just gonna remove this and put his own thing."
- **Zeina:** No direct mention of Zeina or specific animation contributions in this transcript. Kaze sarcastically remarks about characters T-posing, but this doesn't detail Zeina's role.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Lila (Chat):** Actively provides feedback, suggestions, and code/scripts that Kaze tests. Engages in technical discussions and playful banter. Kaze mentions a bug caused by something Lila wrote.
        - Quote: "The thing you wrote made the bug happen, where if you walk into a ceiling, you just clip into the ground. So I can't use that."
    - **KakiDev (Chat):** Offers technical suggestions, for instance, regarding compiler pragmas and optimizing collision data structures (from linked lists to arrays). Kaze values these ideas.
        - Quote: "yeah your idea sounds sensible khaki honestly maybe there should just be arrays formed when the level boots you know what I'll note that changed on that's a good idea"
    - **Frameperfection:** His patch is used for rounded wall collisions.
        - Quote: "Yes, wall collisions are rounded through frame perfection's patch."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Major Level Restructure (Course 12):** An area was removed, and a train station element was repositioned to improve flow and introduce new gameplay.
- **New Gameplay Encounters:** A "Boshi" shootout cutscene is planned, involving a Wild West-style duel where the player must press B before Boshi.
- **Level Flow and Navigation:** A key concern is ensuring multiple paths and avoiding dead ends. Kaze actively seeks to improve how players navigate from one part of an area to another (e.g., "I feel like there needs to be a way to go from here to here").
- **Collectibles (Red Coins):** Finding creative and meaningful placements for all eight Red Coins in an area is a recurring design challenge. Red coins in this hack have special B-parameters allowing them to function across different sub-areas. Red coin stars are "bootless" (don't kick Mario out of the level).
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - A persistent compiler warning related to the `fp` register being "bound to multiple values" across different threads is a source of frustration.
    - Emulator compatibility and performance (e.g., Project 64 1.6 crashing, moving to an in-development "Project 64 Legacy").
    - Optimizing performance, such as Z-sorting geometry by naming meshes alphabetically for render order.
- **Visual Design:** Implementing lighting (e.g., using fireplaces as light sources in the mine), UV unwrapping complex geometry, and ensuring assets fit the N64 aesthetic.

## Business Aspects
- No explicit discussion of marketing, funding, or release/distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" itself.
- Kaze briefly considers the implications of making a public video about an "Ace Bug," weighing the educational benefit against the risk of misuse, which touches on public relations and community management.

## Key Quotes
- "Because I thought about it and I realized the course is not very good. And I think now it is good." (Reflecting his iterative design and commitment to quality)
- "But for like, a weird nerd that's been playing Nintendo games in his basement for 25 years, my game is definitely going to be way better." (Defining his target audience and ambition)
- "We first make the level design and then we make the visuals." (Insight into his development workflow)
- "I fixed all the compiler errors or all the warnings but this one I cannot fix... The issue is that the fp register is bound to multiple values... I don't think I can turn it off." (Highlighting a persistent technical challenge)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Iterative Design of Course 12:** Explore the decision-making process behind the "big restructures" in Course 12, including the removal of an area and the introduction of the Boshi shootout. What prompted these changes?

## Game Development Process
-   **Current Focus: Microcode Optimization:** A significant portion of development is currently dedicated to integrating and optimizing the F3DEX3 microcode, a custom N64 graphics microcode developed by Soren. The goal is to leverage its advanced features and improve performance for "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI).
-   **Iterative Testing and Debugging:** The stream showcases an active debugging session involving Kaze and Soren, comparing performance metrics between F3DEX2, an older version of F3DEX3, and the latest F3DEX3 to diagnose why the new microcode is slower in RTYI. This involves commenting out code sections, analyzing performance counters (RSP/RDP time, FIFO waits), and live troubleshooting.
-   **Level Design Progress:** Level design is well underway. Kaze mentions working on a Mario Kart 64 themed "retro pipe" area, stating it's "course 12 out of 15," indicating substantial progress in level creation.
-   **Technical Integration Challenges:** Integrating F3DEX3 has introduced specific tasks, such as needing to update the game's lighting GBI (graphics binary interface) because "Mario has no colors right now is that we changed the GBI in FBDX3."

## Personal Insights
-   **Pragmatism in Tooling:** Kaze expresses a preference for familiar and reliable tools, even if older, stating about Project64 1.6, "It's just so convenient to use. Parallel still doesn't work for me. I just can't use it."
-   **Focus on Core Game Creation:** Kaze's primary desire is to develop the game itself, rather than get bogged down in emulator or peripheral tool development: "I don't want to lose everything. No, I do not want to make my own emulator. I just want to make my N64 game. Ideally, I wouldn't have to deal with emulators at all."
-   **Awareness of Community and Online Presence:** Kaze is aware of his audience and the demands of streaming, mentioning at the end, "I got to check all the fires of people complaining about the video."
-   **Openness to Experimentation:** Kaze is willing to engage in deep technical dives and experimentation live on stream to solve problems, as seen with the F3DEX3 debugging.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Soren (F3DEX3 Developer):**
    -   The primary collaborator featured in this transcript. Soren is the creator of the F3DEX3 microcode that Kaze is implementing in RTYI.
    -   He joined the stream to help Kaze diagnose performance issues with F3DEX3, explaining its architecture and guiding Kaze through debugging steps.
    -   Soren also created "Sec64," a tool Kaze uses for N64 music sequence formatting.
    -   He was previously director of "Triforce%," an Ocarina of Time arbitrary code execution project.
-   **Zeina (Animations):**
    -   Mentioned indirectly in the context of a past collaboration challenge: "Someone offered to do the animations in 2021 and they kept saying I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it and then they didn't do it. And that's why you don't do call-ups." This highlights a past difficulty in securing animation assets. No current positive contribution from Zeina is detailed in this transcript.
-   **Badub (Composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   "Ruski": Mentioned briefly by Soren in the context of a "new boot code" potentially preventing unauthorized reproduction of ROM hacks, not as a direct RTYI contributor.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Performance-Oriented Lighting:** Kaze prioritizes performance and emulator compatibility. For RTYI, this means "everything here is vertex colored" for static environments. Dynamic lighting is used for actors ("I use world lighting But it's only for moving actors"), sometimes with multiple directional lights ("some levels have up to like Seven light sources active at the same time"). He explicitly avoids N64 point lights for broader compatibility: "No, absolutely not [using point lights] because I want to make sure and runs fine on emulators."
-   **F3DEX3 Performance Bottleneck:** The central challenge discussed is that the new F3DEX3 microcode, despite its intended benefits, is currently running significantly slower in RTYI than older microcodes. The stream is dedicated to identifying the cause of this discrepancy (e.g., "it is a 20% higher time. So that's a little crazy").
-   **Optimizing for High Vertex Counts:** The game features scenes with high vertex counts (e.g., "a scene that has 6600 vertices"). Optimizing the RSP (Reality Signal Processor) and RDP (Reality Display Processor) pipeline for such scenes is crucial.
-   **Retro-Themed Content:** RTYI includes "retro pipes," such as a level themed after Mario Kart 64's Calamari Desert, which involves recreating assets and a specific feel.
-   **Feature vs. Performance Trade-offs:** Discussion around F3DEX3's features like "occlusion plane" involves weighing their benefits against the potential performance cost per vertex.

## Business Aspects
-   **No Direct RTYI Business Plans:** The transcript does not contain explicit information about marketing strategies, funding models, or release/distribution plans specifically for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
-   **Community Donations:** Kaze acknowledges a donation during the stream ("Thank you for the donation, one of ShyGuy"), indicating some level of community financial support through streaming.
-   **Awareness of ROM Hack Commercialization:** Soren discusses the issue of unauthorized commercialization of ROM hacks, citing his experience with "The Missing Link" being sold as reproduction cartridges: "...somebody is just taking our stuff and selling it... I also saw online stores that had like a hundred thousand sales of like people's romhacks they literally made millions of of that." This reflects an awareness of the broader ecosystem and its challenges.
-   **Media Presence:** Kaze notes Soren's feature on "Gamers Nexus," showing an awareness of media attention within the N64/modding community.

## Key Quotes
-   Kaze Emanuar: "The problem is, f3d-ex3 on my game runs significantly slower. So we need to fix that." (Highlights the central technical challenge being addressed).
-   Soren: "My name is Soren. I am a person making F3DEX3 custom microcode for N64, which Kaza is trying to use in Return to Yoshi's Island." (Introduces a key collaborator and the technology at the heart of the discussion).
-   Kaze Emanuar: "No, absolutely not [using point lights in RTYI] because I want to make sure and runs fine on emulators. So I stick to just my f3dx... everything here is vertex colored." (Explains a core design philosophy driven by performance and compatibility).

## Potential Interview Topics
-   **The Vision for F3DEX3 in RTYI:** Explore Kaze's initial reasons for adopting F3DEX3, the features he hopes to leverage, and how the current performance challenges are impacting his development roadmap and expectations.

## Game Development Process
-   Current focus is on animating and programming Non-Player Characters (NPCs), specifically Dry Bones, a "Piano Guy," and "Cow Boshy." This includes implementing walk/run cycles, interaction animations (like Dry Bones crumbling when jumped on), and unique behaviors (like a shootout minigame with Cow Boshy).
-   Kaze is working on a "secret" collaboration level with a creator named Aza, which is intended for both "Return to Yoshi's Island" and a separate competition (likely the SM64DS Hacking Competition - SEC).
-   There's an ongoing effort to address performance issues, attributed to "program pooling," which seems to be a known limitation Kaze is working within.
-   Sound design is being implemented for NPCs, including footstep sounds and reaction sounds, with consideration for sound priority and fall-off.
-   Texture optimization is actively being done (e.g., for the Piano Guy model) to save memory.
-   The development process is iterative, with Kaze implementing features, testing them in-game, and making adjustments based on how they feel and look (e.g., Dry Bones walk animation choice, animation speeds).

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze strongly values "intrinsic motivation" in game design, preferring gameplay that is inherently fun and engaging over systems that rely on external rewards. He contrasts games like Tears of the Kingdom (high intrinsic motivation) with Pokémon (feeling more like a "job" due to extrinsic motivation).
-   He believes Super Mario 64 is "special" due to its unique physics and movement, which no subsequent game has replicated, making it a prime candidate for ROM hacking.
-   Kaze has a direct and often critical communication style, expressing strong opinions on various topics, including streaming culture (dislike for "farming parasocials") and what he perceives as narcissistic behavior.
-   He shows a pragmatic approach to development, acknowledging limitations (like performance) and working within them or finding practical solutions.
-   He often thinks aloud, explaining his design choices and technical reasoning to his audience during the stream.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Badub's involvement.
-   **Biobak:**
    -   Kaze shares previews of unreleased content with Biobank via DMs (e.g., the secret collab level).
    -   Kaze asks Biobank for a technical shortcut/hotkey related to his development tools, suggesting Biobank has technical knowledge Kaze respects.
    -   It's implied Biobank is a trusted member of Kaze's inner circle for feedback, though specific contributions to RTYI assets are not detailed in this transcript.
-   **Zeina (Zayna):**
    -   Zayna is a key collaborator providing animations for multiple NPCs, including the Dry Bones, the "Piano Guy," and "Cow Boshy."
    -   Kaze directly praises Zayna's animation work ("Zayna, the Dry Bones look really, really good in-game. You will love them.").
    -   Kaze processes models and textures provided by Zayna, sometimes making adjustments for optimization or engine compatibility (e.g., simplifying Piano Guy's textures, fixing UVs).
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Aza:** Collaborating with Kaze on a level. Both are making a level for a "call up" (collaboration) that will also feature in the "SEC" (likely SM64DS Hacking Competition).
    -   **Sauron:** Mentioned as someone Kaze might collaborate with to debug an issue with "fpdx" in the future.
    -   **Cargo:** Creator of the "Summer Cart" (an N64 flashcart for development), which Kaze discusses and intends to purchase. Not a direct RTYI contributor, but relevant to Kaze's development toolkit.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **NPC Behavior and Animation:**
    -   Choosing between different walk animations for Dry Bones (settling on a "zombie walk" that fits the character).
    -   Scaling animation speeds with NPC walking speeds for a more natural look.
    -   Designing the Dry Bones to crumble when jumped on, similar to its behavior in official Mario games.
    -   Developing a shootout minigame with Cow Boshy, including a countdown, reaction-based shooting, and dialogue.
    -   Making the Cow Boshy duel progressively easier if the player loses, to ensure accessibility.
-   **Level Design and Aesthetics:**
    -   Discussion of a "retro stage" (Amara Desert 64 from Mario Kart 64) and justifying its "ugly" aesthetic as fitting for a retro-themed area.
    -   Optimizing textures for NPCs like the Piano Guy to save memory and fit N64 limitations.
-   **Technical Challenges:**
    -   Persistent performance issues ("program pooling") that affect frame rate. Kaze acknowledges this as a general problem.
    -   Fixing issues with new fast Piranha DirectX (fpdx) being too slow, requiring future debugging.
    -   Ensuring correct sound implementation, including managing sound priorities to prevent sounds from cutting each other out (e.g., barrel sounds muting other noises).
    -   Debugging NPC interaction logic, such as characters not initiating dialogue correctly.
-   **Dialogue and Story:**
    -   Writing "cowboy-themed" dialogue for Cow Boshy, aiming for an "arrogant, angsty, edgy" persona.
    -   Considering player dialogue choices (e.g., "Yeah partner" vs. "Nary a bit") for interactions.

## Business Aspects
-   **Exposure over Monetization:** Kaze mentions a "double cash in" strategy for the collab level with Aza, referring to gaining exposure by featuring the level in both "Return to Yoshi's Island" and the SEC competition, rather than direct financial gain.
-   **Consideration for Future Projects:** When discussing a hypothetical Wind Waker modding project, Kaze notes it would "not [be] financially worth it unless someone pays me to work on that," indicating an awareness of effort vs. financial return for large, new undertakings, though this doesn't directly apply to RTYI.
-   **No direct discussion of marketing, funding, or specific release/distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" was found in this transcript.**

## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus:** The stream heavily focuses on the visual refinement and technical implementation of a desert-themed level, specifically addressing quicksand appearance, skybox design, background elements (cliffs), and fog effects. This indicates a stage of detailed level construction and aesthetic polishing.
- **Iterative Approach:** Kaze demonstrates a highly iterative development style, constantly trying different textures, shaders (combiners), and geometric arrangements, then immediately testing and evaluating the results. He states, "Yeah, these are the kind of things where you just have to try, see what happens, see how it turns out, I find."
- **Performance Optimization:** A significant portion is dedicated to N64 performance, discussing render distance, overdraw, polygon counts, and potential benefits from F3DX3 (a custom microcode) and culling. He mentions aiming for solid frame rates even with complex visuals: "30. And we didn't even optimize or put FADX3 in yet. Oh, that's crazy." He later discovers culling wasn't even enabled, implying significant performance gains are still possible.
- **Tooling:** Kaze mentions using tools like Fast64 (a Mario 64 level editor) and Blender, and encountering/working around their limitations or bugs (e.g., "Fast64 rendering bug," "fast64 resetting my hex edits").
- **Hardware Testing:** He performs tests on actual N64 hardware ("Let's check this out on N64 and see how it performs") to get accurate performance metrics beyond emulation.

## Personal Insights
- **Artistic Vision & Frustration:** Kaze has a strong vision for the game's aesthetics and "vibe," particularly concerning the fog color ("The fog color right now is very essential for the art style here. Making it all yellow would change the vibe a lot."). He expresses frustration when technical hurdles or tool limitations impede this vision (e.g., "Dude, I gotta get rid of this cliff in the skybox, it is pissing me off," "This combiner is unworkable").
- **Problem-Solving Attitude:** Despite frustrations, he displays a persistent problem-solving approach, exploring various technical solutions for visual challenges, often thinking aloud and engaging with chat for ideas.
- **Humor and Candor:** Kaze is candid about his process, mistakes, and opinions, often using humor (e.g., "What an animation, I call the animation comedy death," "Surely sand 6 will be better than sand 21, clueless"). He also briefly rants about YouTube recommendations, showing a more personal side.
- **Pride in Optimization:** He shows pride in pushing the N64's capabilities, especially regarding his project's optimization compared to others ("How the fuck did LRT not even reach solid 30 FPS? Because they ain't me."). He also brags about Sauron's assessment of RTYI's optimization.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (presumed "my dupe"):**
    - Contribution: Composer for the game. Kaze states, "...my dupe wants to make all of it," referring to the music.
    - Interaction: Kaze hopes to release an OST cartridge alongside the game, implying a significant and valued contribution from the composer.
- **Biobak:**
    - Contribution: Graphics artist. Kaze mentions, "He wanted to help me rework a bunch of levels."
    - Interaction/Status: Kaze expresses concern: "Dude, has anyone seen Biobank recently? He's been gone for a while... I hope he's not gone. That'd be really unfortunate for the case empire." This suggests Biobak is a valued contributor whose absence is felt.
- **Zeina:**
    - No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Zeina or animations. The "comedy death" animation mentioned at the start seems to be Kaze's own experiment or a placeholder.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Sauron:** Working on F3DX3 (a custom N64 microcode) optimization. Kaze states Sauron "thinks that in Return to Yoshi's Island the memory and RDP is so optimized that with F3dx3 the RSP becomes the bottleneck. And because F3dx3 has more RSP costs, that is likely it. So he's making a version of F3dx3 that has some optimized RDSP." This collaboration is key for performance.
    - **Eric:** Kaze asks, "Does Eric hack quicksand right now?" This sounds like another ROM hacker whose work Kaze might be following or referencing, rather than a direct collaborator on RTYI from this specific transcript.
    - **Chat (Clayman, Cack Honka Honka, g-boy, Rainy, Liliana, Jan, Agirov, Seymour Sam, etc.):** While not formal collaborators, the chat actively provides suggestions and feedback that Kaze sometimes considers or responds to (e.g., "Can't you render the distance cliffs in another layer like OOT renders in Skybox? Yes, that's what I would do.").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Skybox and Background Aesthetics:** A major challenge is creating a convincing and aesthetically pleasing skybox/background that integrates with the level, manages render distance, and avoids looking "floaty." Kaze experiments with distant cliffs, fog, color matching, and parallax effects.
    - *Challenge:* "One thing I worry about is that players might think they have to go to the bottom here. I'd like to prevent that a lot."
    - *Solution Attempt:* Fading distant elements into fog or a background color, using multiple layers for cliffs.
- **Quicksand Visuals:** Finding a good visual representation for quicksand that looks appealing and functional.
    - *Challenge:* Initial attempts look "terrible." "Quicksand is not it, definitely not."
    - *Solution Attempt:* Experimenting with textures, shaders (combiners), fading edges, and ensuring it's visually distinct from walkable ground.
- **Performance vs. Visual Fidelity:** Constantly balancing the desire for complex, appealing visuals with the N64's hardware limitations.
    - *Challenge:* "The problem is, this texture is so big that it is not possible to make it slowly move, at least not cheaply."
    - *Decision:* Opting for solutions that are "cheap to render," simplifying geometry, and relying on upcoming F3DX3 optimizations.
- **Art Style Consistency:** Maintaining a cohesive art style, especially regarding colors (e.g., the importance of the blue fog, reluctance to change it).
    - *Challenge:* "The fog color right now is very essential for the art style here... Making it all yellow would change the vibe a lot."
- **Level Element: Train:** Integrating a moving train element, including fixing its rotation and pitch to match the surface.

## Business Aspects
- **Potential for an N64 Game in 2024:** Kaze mentions, "So, yeah, so fun fact, there was a company that approached me recently and they said they want to make an N64 game in 2024. Looks like they might be doing it, but we'll find out in June." He discusses the marketing potential: "...if you have the marketing of, hey, this is an N64 game, but there's also a PC port available, it's kind of insane. That would make the news and you would get so much marketing for free."
- **OST Release:** "I'm hoping that I can release RTYI alongside an OST cartridge." This indicates a plan for a physical or distributable product related to the game.
- **Marketing Awareness (General):** While RTYI is a ROM hack, Kaze shows an understanding of game marketing principles when discussing the potential N64 company project.

## Key Quotes
- "Yeah, these are the kind of things where you just have to try, see what happens, see how it turns out, I find." (Illustrates his iterative development philosophy).
- "The fog color right now is very essential for the art style here. Making it all yellow would change the vibe a lot." (Highlights the importance of artistic vision and consistency).
- "He said he thinks that in Return to Yoshi's Island the memory and RDP is so optimized that with F3dx3 the RSP becomes the bottleneck... So he's making a version of F3dx3 that has some optimized RDSP." (Shows collaborative effort in pushing technical boundaries and pride in optimization).
- "Dude, this actually looks incredible for N64." (Kaze's own assessment of the visual progress on actual hardware).

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is in its later stages, with Kaze stating, "only three levels are missing and i already finished one area of that that's like end game."
- Significant off-stream work has been done on secret areas and engine polishing.
- A major focus is ensuring the game runs on actual N64 hardware, with recent success in getting parts of the game to run at "40 FPS before we even optimized it," though some areas like the "overworld is fucked" and crashes occur.
- Kaze is also working on a smaller, "secret project" referred to as a "ROM-Mech" using the same engine.
- Current stream focus is on programming "Boshi, the dino with the gun," including a duel minigame.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly passionate about his work, expressing excitement: "Dude, I wish I could show you guys what I made upstream. It's so cool."
- He takes pride in his custom engine: "Well, basically everything I'm going to release is going to use my engine."
- He has a pragmatic approach to development, willing to simplify features if they become too complex to implement effectively (e.g., the duel countdown).
- Kaze is aware of and somewhat resigned to the possibility of Nintendo takedowns, based on past experiences: "A lot of people tell me that they're worried that this game is going to get taken down by nintendo but i never understood what they think that would look like..."
- He values open source principles for software like Blender: "And it is open source, which means it's actually going to be good in 5 years."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: [No specific new information about Badub's contributions during this stream segment, though listed as a known composer for the project.]
- Biobak: A graphics artist who reviews and improves Kaze's models: "usually after I'm done, we got Biobank looking over it and he makes them a lot better."
- Zeina: Implied to work on animations. Kaze mentions, "Can you believe Zeyna's on babysitting instead of making games with me right now?"
- Other Contributors:
    - **Leela:** Collaborating on the "secret project" (ROM-Mech). Working on implementing Quaternions into the engine, which will allow for "free translation" in animations. Described as "another RobMaker" Kaze is collaborating with.
    - **UED:** Provided the 3D model for the cork gun used in the Boshi duel: "Good thing UED has sent me a model of it."
    - **CX-Linx:** A community member Kaze interacts with during technical discussions.
    - **Unnamed individual:** Emailed Kaze a "new sine and cosine approximation that might actually be worth it."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boshi Duel Minigame:**
    - Designing a quick-draw duel mechanic: "3, 2, 1 and then there's a random delay and it says go. And you gotta press B to shoot him."
    - Penalty for shooting early: "If you shoot early your gun will blow up in your face."
    - Iterating on the countdown presentation: Initially considered a HUD countdown, but shifted to a full cutscene due to programming complexity: "Wait, a HUD countdown is gonna suck to program... we'll just make a cutscene fuck it this is painful to do without a cutscene."
    - Balancing reaction time: "first attempt is really difficult i'm thinking like 280 millisecond reaction time and then every time you lose you get like three frames more reaction time." This also needs to account for modern display lag.
    - Camera work for the cutscene: Involves significant trial and error to get framing right for both widescreen and 4:3 aspect ratios.
- **Performance and N64 Hardware:**
    - Constant effort to optimize for N64 hardware, including fixing crashes (e.g., "the overworld is fucked").
    - Implementing culling techniques: "You see these beams here? We can make it so that they cull... We can just make it not process the triangles at all."
    - Addressing RAM limitations, e.g., by decimating models like the egg.
- **Animation System Limitations:** Mario 64's animation system doesn't inherently support translation for animated objects beyond the first frame, requiring workarounds.
- **"Save State Yoshi" Raps:** A unique, if controversial, feature where a Yoshi character raps at the player for using save states. Kaze defends the creative choice despite some chat members finding them "cringe."

## Business Aspects
- **Future Projects & Funding:** Kaze plans to launch a Kickstarter for an original game after "Return to Yoshi's Island": "i'm gonna bundle it together with the ad for my kickstarter for the game i'm gonna make after i'm done with return to yoshi's islands."
- **Monetization Stance:** He is against making Patreon-exclusive content for this ROM hack: "I'm not making any Patreon exclusives. I don't want people to even think I'm trying to bait people into my Patreon."
- **Release Strategy Concerns:** Worried about timing the ROM hack's release to avoid coinciding with major Nintendo game releases, which he believes increases the likelihood of a takedown: "if you release your romhack around the same time as a big nintendo game comes out you are going to get taken down 100% like right away."
- **Copyright & Takedowns:** Has experienced numerous video takedowns by Nintendo previously (affecting "70 of my videos," including Blender tutorials and Net64 showcases) and anticipates potential takedown of the game's trailer, planning a "copyright free version."

## Key Quotes
- "Do you guys actually realize how crazy it is how close we're done to being done like only three levels are missing and i already finished one area of that that's like end game but it's still gonna take a long time but still it's like it's the last fifth of the game that feels like end stretch to me." (Reflecting on project progress)
- "Well, basically everything I'm going to release is going to use my engine." (On the versatility and importance of his custom engine)
- "A lot of people tell me that they're worried that this game is going to get taken down by nintendo but i never understood what they think that would look like... they already did that [takedowns on videos]." (On the ever-present Nintendo concern)

-   He has a strong opinion against self-inserts in games: "I don't put myself in my games I Think self inserts is a little cringe."
-   Kaze reflects on the ROM hacking community and its perception of other hacks (e.g., Star Revenge), preferring to let others enjoy what they like while maintaining his own standards and perspective.
-   He emphasizes making features efficient: "Every time you program something, you want it to be free of cost. If you're not using that part of codes."
-   He expresses a desire for his game to be polished and for mechanics to "feel good" (e.g., "speed kicks in this game feel so good").

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (composer):** No specific information about Badub's contributions or interactions was found in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    -   Significantly reworking graphics for levels, such as Course 11, making them look "insane" and adding depth using "combiners" (likely a Fast64 feature). Kaze: "It's crazy. Looks so much better already."
    -   Communicates with Kaze about technical issues (e.g., "Biobank had an issue with the combiner, so he sent me an image").
-   **Zeina (animations):** No specific information about Zeina's contributions or interactions was found in this transcript. (The transcript mentions Zeno for textures, which might be a different person or a typo for Zeina, but context points to textures.)
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Zeno:** Making textures for the "Rent Center Badland" level. ("Zeno's making the textures.")
    -   **Sauron:** Working on optimizing F3DX (N64 graphics microcode) to be less RSP-intensive, aiming to improve performance for "Return to Yoshi's Island." ("He's currently working on making F3DX less RSP intensive in the hopes that it'll work on RTYI.")
    -   **Lila (community member/tester):** Provides significant feedback on gameplay elements like duel timing and visual design (saloon doors). Kaze actively discusses and sometimes implements her suggestions.
    -   **B-Turk (community member):** Actively contributed to writing and refining the rap lyrics for the "Space Yoshi" anti-save-state feature during the stream.
    -   **Aza (Eiza):** Kaze mentions wanting permission to show a "compact" they made and refers to a "short hack" he created with Eiza.
    -   **Dan (community member):** Hosts a voice channel where Kaze and others discuss technical aspects of N64 development like shadows and graph nodes.
    -   **Red (audio):** Mentioned as working on audio, though Kaze jests about the pace of their work. ("Have you ever seen Red finish anything ever? Come on.")

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Saloon Doors:** Significant time spent designing and debugging the physics and interaction of swinging saloon doors, including rotation logic, player collision, and visual appearance (size, texture). A key challenge was getting the doors to rotate correctly based on Mario's approach and interaction, eventually solved by using "angle to Mario" instead of "face angle."
-   **Boshy Duel Mechanic:** Iterative refinement of a dueling character ("Boshy"), including the timing of shots, adding a visual countdown (3-2-1), adjusting sound effects, and implementing pitch changes for Boshy's voice. Feedback from Lila influenced the duel's timing.
-   **Bartender Koopa's Hat:** Designing a visual gag where the bartender's hat grows larger with each star collected in the level. This involved adjusting the 3D model vertices.
-   **Sound Design:** Implementing a system to pitch individual sound effects and character voices, particularly for Boshy and dialogue boxes, to enhance characterization and game events. Kaze aimed for an efficient implementation.
-   **Memory and Performance:** Ongoing consideration for N64 limitations, such as moving certain objects to specific memory banks to free up resources and relying on collaborators (Sauron) to optimize graphics performance.
-   **Fast64 Tool Issues:** Encountering and working around bugs or quirks in the Fast64 development tool, such as "render mode bleeding."
-   **Anti-Save-State Feature ("Space Yoshi"):** Designing a humorous in-game consequence for using save states, involving a "Space Yoshi" character delivering rap lyrics. The lyrics themselves were a collaborative effort with the community (B-Turk).
-   **Yoshi Coins:** Acknowledged as an incomplete element for the current stage that needs finishing.
-   **Minigames:** Hesitancy to add a full new minigame (like horseshoe throwing) due to memory constraints in the current level: "We kind of have an issue with this level in that we're kind of out of memory."

## Business Aspects
-   **Content Creation for Audience Engagement:** Kaze mentions paying a "shorts guy" approximately $270 per year to create YouTube Shorts from his stream content. He also considers clipping stream highlights for Shorts himself ("Can I just clip all this shit and make it into YouTube shorts?").
-   **No Direct Monetization or Formal Release Plans Mentioned:** As a ROM hack, there's no discussion of selling the game. While eventual release is implied, no specific timelines or distribution strategies are detailed in this transcript. Kaze mentions one "ROM egg" is finished but "we didn't even release it yet."

## Key Quotes
-   "Leaving a comment, critiquing whatever I made is always good... But there's also a good chance that I'll seriously look at it and reconsider my decisions. I feel like that's kind of like an integrity thing you should do." (Kaze on handling criticism)
-   "It was all because I used fucking face angle instead of angle to Mario. I think it was. Whoops." (Kaze on solving a frustrating bug with the saloon doors, highlighting the trial-and-error nature of development)
-   "Biobank had an issue with the combiner, so he sent me an image and he made it look like this. It's crazy. Looks so much better already. It looks like it has so much depth." (Kaze expressing excitement about a collaborator's graphical improvements)

## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively working on a specific level, implementing elements like bandits, NPC interactions, and environment details (e.g., Tumbleweed store, Koopa bank).
- Significant progress has been made on interactive elements like trains, which now have VFX, SFX, and camera shake.
- A major ongoing challenge is N64 RAM limitations, which has led to decisions like cutting a planned area ("Yoshi Ranch") and using clever design to avoid excessive 3D modeling (e.g., bandits stealing items from stores).
- Debugging and fixing behaviors, particularly vanilla Mario 64 elements like the Pokey enemy, is a time-consuming part of the process due to interactions with Kaze's custom engine modifications.
- The to-do list includes finishing signs, placing NPCs, and implementing enemy behaviors. The current level is described as "40,000 triangles," indicating its complexity.
- Kaze is also focusing on polishing aspects like lighting and collision.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze aims for a game that evokes the Mario 64 feel but isn't a direct imitation: "we don't want the exact Mario 64 look. It still looks very Mario 64."
- He has a clear vision for the soundtrack, desiring something that uses the Mario 64 sound font creatively to sound new yet familiar: "it sounds like a completely new soundtrack with like a similar vibe to me. That's what I want anyway."
- He expresses strong opinions on game design, such as disliking "music themes" for levels as they've "already been done," and has a general aversion to 2D platformers and most boss fights.
- Kaze is pragmatic when facing technical limitations, accepting the necessity of cutting content like the "Yoshi Ranch" for the overall health of the project.
- He reflects on the nature of his custom engine modifications, acknowledging that it can sometimes break vanilla game behaviors, requiring significant debugging.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Badem Soundcloud):**
    - Composer for the game.
    - Kaze praises his music as "freaking amazing" and notes its creative use of the default Mario 64 sound font to achieve a new yet fitting vibe.
- **Biobak (referred to as Biomech/Biobak):**
    - Appears to be a graphics artist, possibly working on lighting systems.
    - Kaze mentions a "node-based lightning" system that Biobak might be implementing, and humorously questions a texture/lighting issue possibly related to Biobak's work.
- **Zeina (Zeno):**
    - Animator and asset creator.
    - Kaze mentions needing to ask Zeina to create animations for characters (e.g., Pokey) and 3D models for level elements (e.g., "tumbleweed store").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - While not direct asset contributors in the same vein, chat members like **Leila** and **Minty** provide real-time feedback, ask clarifying questions, and act as a sounding board for Kaze during the development stream. Leila, in particular, seems to have ongoing conversations with Kaze about visual elements.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **RAM Limitation:** This is the most significant recurring challenge. It dictates:
    - Scope of levels (e.g., cutting the "Yoshi Ranch" area).
    - Asset creation strategies (e.g., having bandits "steal" items from stores to avoid modeling the items themselves: "this is a trick we do so we don't actually have to 3D model the stuff here because we are getting pretty close to running out of RAM").
    - The need to meticulously manage triangle counts and data per area. Kaze expresses a wish for "data per area" to be easier in the decompilation project.
- **Enemy Behavior Implementation:**
    - Integrating and debugging vanilla Mario 64 enemy behaviors (like Pokey) into Kaze's modified engine is a major task. The Pokey required extensive debugging to fix its spawning, movement, scaling, collision, and visual rendering.
    - Kaze discovered the Pokey's original code performed an unexpectedly high number of raycasts (37 per tick), which conflicted with his engine's optimization that stops raycasting for non-moving objects.
- **NPC and Level Interactivity:**
    - Designing NPCs with specific dialogue and roles to make the world feel more alive (e.g., characters complaining about sold-out items, a shifty character, interactions at the train station).
    - Implementing interactive elements like trains that act as obstacles with VFX and SFX.
- **Lighting and Visuals:**
    - Fixing issues where objects or parts of models don't receive lighting correctly (e.g., Yoshi coins, parts of character models).
    - Adjusting textures and shaders to achieve the desired look while working within engine constraints.
- **Level Design & Pacing:**
    - Adding coins to guide players and encourage exploration (e.g., "coins on the track here to encourage the player to explore this").
    - Realizing late in the process that elements like "train tracks" will consume more memory, leading to further concerns.

## Business Aspects
- **Donations/Funding:**
    - Kaze experiences significant issues with his PayPal account and donation setup, indicating that donations are a form of support for his work. He mentions his old PayPal email being linked and needing to resolve issues with identity verification.
- **Marketing/Visibility (Informal):**
    - Kaze briefly muses about "theory baiting" popular YouTubers (Swanky Box, Nathaniel Bandy, etc.) by including intriguing elements in the game, suggesting an awareness of how community content creators can generate visibility.
- No formal release plans, distribution methods, or other direct business strategies were discussed in this transcript segment.

## Key Quotes
- "And this is a trick we do so we don't actually have to 3D model the stuff here because we are getting pretty close to running out of RAM." (Illustrates creative problem-solving due to technical constraints).
- "It still looks very Mario 64. I don't think the ones in Mario 64 go for the metallic look actually... We don't want the exact Mario 64 look." (Highlights the balance between nostalgia and new artistic direction).
- "Remember when I said that I wouldn't be surprised? If the pokey just worked This is what we got this is pokey peak performance... Actually, no. A Pokey was doing 36 Raycasts every tick... And my engine made it so that if an object doesn't move it doesn't Raycast the floor every tick. But they needed the floor to be Raycasted every tick." (Summarizes the challenges of integrating vanilla features into a modified engine and the deep technical debugging required).

## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The stream shows Kaze actively working on a specific level, focusing on a new enemy ("coin-stealing guy") and implementing its mechanics related to Yoshi Coins. He mentions this is the "last Yoshi coin in this level."
- **Major Milestones:**
    - Nearing completion of a level: "after this by the way we're done with the level all that will be missing is some animations then Zayna's currently working on and the sign."
    - By the end of the stream, Kaze states: "All right, all that's missing on the level here now It's a few animations that I'm not making the science that's in us making and then the condition of that I have to make Like the wood needs to make what sounds and stuff like that and some things need to be climbable But I think other than that we're all done."
- **Development Stages:** The stream captures a mix of feature implementation (enemy AI, dialogue, interactions), bug fixing (coin rendering, cutscene logic, enemy pathing, particle despawning), and integration of collaborator assets (animations, music).
- **Future Work:** After the current tasks, "it is time to make the collision work." The next stream will likely not be on "Chris 12" (current level name?) anymore, implying moving to new content or bug-fixing.

## Personal Insights
- **Design Philosophy:** Kaze aims to create engaging mechanics. For example, Yoshi Coins are designed to be "obtained by interacting with the environment in like creative ways," inspired by Mario Sunshine, and to "fuel that like sense of exploration."
- **Frustrations:** He expresses significant frustration with unhelpful external resources like Stack Overflow ("biggest mistake of my life," "they just want to waste my time") and technical annoyances like a persistent GCC compiler "note."
- **Problem-Solving Approach:** Kaze demonstrates a hands-on, iterative approach to debugging and feature development, often working through issues live on stream.
- **Opinions on Game Elements:** He has strong opinions on game design, such as disliking how 100-coin stars are often implemented and wanting to improve upon that with Yoshi Coins.
- **Future Aspirations:** While passionate about ROM hacking, he acknowledges its financial limitations: "most likely it will be my own game made in Unreal Engine just cuz I have to think about the financial aspects as well."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (also referred to as "Doop"):**
    - Role: Composer.
    - Contribution: "Doop is also currently making a song for the Western dual scene I believe so that's gonna be very fun." He is also likely responsible for other music, as Kaze mentions wanting to "show you the hideout music."
- **Biobak:**
    - Role: Graphics artist/Level work.
    - Contribution: "Biobak still has some work to do after." Kaze also mentions potential graphical issues Biobak might address or that Kaze will fix himself, e.g., "the vertex colors on this are really dirty and bad oh we gotta fix that." Kaze notes for Biobak: "biomech if you look at this level you will see a few issues like this around don't worry about it I'll fix those at the end."
- **Zeina:**
    - Role: Animator.
    - Contribution: "all that will be missing is some animations then Zayna's currently working on." Animations are needed for the coin-stealing enemy's "trip" and other elements to finalize the level.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Saschka Pity (Chat Member):** Suggested or was asked to help with translating dialogue into "cowboy" style for the coin-stealing enemy, though Kaze ultimately uses ChatGPT for this. "I'm gonna ask Saschka Pity to translate this to cowboy."
    - **Chat Community (General):** Viewers provide real-time feedback, suggestions (e.g., Leela suggesting names), and engage in Q&A, influencing small aspects or providing moral support.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Coin-Stealing Enemy:**
    - Mechanic: Steals coins from the player. If caught, says "no" and runs off, spawning a Yoshi Coin.
    - Easter Egg: Can be "killed" in a secret way.
    - Pity Mechanic: If the player has zero coins, the enemy says, "wow, you're broke. I take pity on you. Here's a Yoshi coin for you."
    - Dialogue: Kaze works on its dialogue, using ChatGPT to get a "cowboy" feel.
    - Challenges: Implementing its running-off behavior, coin-stealing animation/visuals, tripping animation, and debugging its cutscene.
- **Yoshi Coins:**
    - Purpose: Replacement for traditional 100-coin stars. "Yes the Yoshi coins are our replacement for the 100 coin stars."
    - Design Goal: To be obtained through creative interaction with the environment, not just collection. "Tying reward to that hopefully fuels that like sense of exploration."
    - Reward Structure: Collecting all Yoshi Coins in a level awards a star. "if you find all of them in a level you get a star basically."
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - GCC Compiler "Note": A persistent, non-critical but annoying message related to multi-threading and FP register usage on the N64 that Kaze struggles to resolve. "every time i compile the game i get this issue it's not a real bug it's just a note."
    - Bug Fixing: Numerous bugs addressed during the stream, including coins not rendering, cutscenes not ending correctly, enemy AI pathing ("Why is he so goddamn fast? Oh, because he moves twice."), particle despawning, and train mechanics.
    - Optimization: Reduced Pokey enemy raycasts from ~31 to 1. "seems kind of excessive, yeah, I reduced it to one."
- **Level Design:**
    - Train System: Implementing trains that follow paths, have sound render radiuses, and ensuring they work correctly across area transitions.
    - Ambient Audio: Plans to "go over the entire game at the end and make sure that the ambient everywhere is perfect."
    - Player Guidance: Using environmental cues and enemy behavior to pique player curiosity.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization Issues:**
    - Patreon: Experienced 1.5 years of being unable to receive payments, which was recently resolved. "Guys can you believe that after one and a half years of being unable to get payments from Patreon, they finally made it so that my account works again?"
    - PayPal: Still experiences issues with PayPal, with funds being frozen. "And Paypal still doesn't work. Fun fact, any money you send me on Paypal, I can't use it."
    - Alternative Platforms: Recommends Ko-fi over Patreon. "do not use Patreon, use Ko-fi or something. They take a smaller cut and they're not as dogshit to work with."
- **Sponsorships:** Actively looking for YouTube sponsors for video content. "I'm looking for a YouTube sponsor and then as soon as I have to sponsor I'll upload this [clip]."
- **Future Financial Planning:** Considers financial viability for future projects, leaning towards original game development in Unreal Engine as ROM hacking is "not a very lucrative project."
- **Copy Protection:** Briefly mentions the idea of implementing copy protection against bootleg cartridges. "I do wanna put some copy protection on against would like hearts on this."

## Key Quotes
- "So this guy basically he steals your coins and if you catch him stealing your coins, he basically says no and then he will run off. This is gonna be the last Yoshi coin in this level and after that it is time to make the collision work." (Highlights specific enemy dev, Yoshi Coin importance, and next steps)
- "yes the Yoshi coins are our replacement for the 100 coin stars... the thing about the Mario Sunshine 100 coin stars is that you get them by interacting with the environment in like creative ways and that's how I want the Yoshi coins to work as well." (Explains design philosophy for a core collectible)
- "Guys if you ever wanna make a Patreon, do not use Patreon, use Ko-fi or something. They take a smaller cut and they're not as dogshit to work with." (Candid advice based on personal negative experiences with funding platforms)
- "most likely it will be my own game made in Unreal Engine just cuz I have to think about the financial aspects as well." (Shows long-term thinking and the financial realities of indie/ROM hack development)

    -   Also involved in personal interactions, such as the haircut incident.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **AkiDev:** Contributed Chain Chomp code, which Kaze later modified significantly to support a second Chain Chomp in a different level.
    -   **Eiza:** Kaze mentions an area in Course 14 he can't show because "Eiza doesn't want me to show it. Because it's part of the compact." This implies Eiza has a role in deciding what content is revealed, possibly another developer or collaborator on a specific feature/project.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Reworking Divine Dino Domain (Course 2):** The original auto-scrolling section with "leaf bolts" was deemed to "suck" and has been replaced with a "platforming playground." The focus is on improving player experience in a sub-area that "sucks to play."
-   **Level Themes:** Specific themes are decided for upcoming courses (Ice Castle, Space Arcade), though Course 15 is still open.
-   **Platforming Focus:** Emphasis on creating fun platforming sections before detailed visual work. This is evident in the blockout phase for Divine Dino Domain.
-   **Technical Bugs:**
    -   A significant bug where being in water can crash the game because "Water hasn't been updated to the new step function yet."
    -   Long loading times experienced during the stream, possibly related to other issues.
    -   The game crashes multiple times during the stream, particularly when working on Divine Dino Domain or using the Parallel emulator.
-   **Collision/Hitbox Issues:** Kaze notes a "scatter box" might be too big and needs reduction. He also adjusts object placement to avoid clipping.
-   **Aesthetics vs. Gameplay:** A recurring decision is to finalize gameplay mechanics and platforming flow first, then address the visual aspects and UV mapping.
-   **Emulator Issues:** Kaze expresses frustration with the Parallel emulator due to frequent updates, slower speed, ROM hack-specific issues, and controller incompatibility, preferring other emulators for testing.

## Business Aspects

- **Badub:** Not directly mentioned by name as a composer for RTYI in this transcript. Kaze discusses listening to "Fungi Mines OST" and liking its vibe, indicating he seeks music that aligns with his vision.
- **Biobak:** "I think Biobank also sometimes makes textures for the levels the team works on." Biobak contributes textures for the game.
- **Zeina:** "Oh yeah, Zena also makes textures." and "Zayn just did a sign for a tumbleweed store... She also made two other ones... Koopa bank here... milk bar the milk bar sign is really good." Zeina contributes textures and specific art assets like signs for levels.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Sauron:** Mentioned in relation to "F3DX3 and RQIA," where Kaze is "still waiting for Sauron to make the final decisions on that." This implies Sauron has a role in technical decisions or feature development, possibly related to the underlying tools or engine components.
    - **Leela (Stream Chatter):** While not a formal collaborator in the same sense, Leela is a frequent interactor in the stream chat, engaging in discussions, debates (e.g., Wild West lighting), and providing a sounding board for Kaze.
    - **Simpleflips (Mentioned):** Kaze jokingly mentions an NDA with Simpleflips, suggesting Simpleflips might have early access for testing or promotion.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - Debugging a significant crash caused by an "S8 register" being overwritten due to a custom optimization. Kaze identified the specific function causing the issue and worked on a fix.
    - Ensuring visual consistency and proper rendering, such as adding fog to moving platforms to make them look less out of place.
- **Level Design & Iteration:**
    - Removing and completely redesigning a "Boring Red Coin Mission" after playtesting revealed it wasn't fun, despite being "cute." The new design will still feature 8 red coins.
    - Adjusting difficulty: "I want this coin to be easier. I don't like how difficult it is to slide on here."
    - Designing new levels with specific themes and atmospheres, like "Quest 13" (ice castle, "gloomy but bright," "suspenseful").
    - Making aesthetic choices for level elements, like deciding that moving platforms should be brick and scuffed, rather than wooden.
- **Asset Creation/Sourcing:**
    - Textures are sourced from "random games," and Kaze "rarely make[s] textures" himself, relying on collaborators like Zeina and Biobak, or existing assets.
    - Integrating custom signs made by Zeina for a "Wild West" themed area.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Implementing moving platforms and considering player interaction with them (e.g., "jump up there, which doesn't work because of the collision").

## Business Aspects
- **Content Distribution:** Kaze streams his development on his main channel, and VODs are uploaded to "CaseClips."
- **Engine Release:** Kaze states, "Then will the engine be open source yes it will be," indicating plans to release the modified game engine publicly.
- **Promotion/Marketing:** Kaze mentions a YouTube video he made about "invisible walls" is performing well, indicating an awareness of content creation for audience engagement.
- **Release Considerations (General):** For a separate "competition" project, Kaze mentions having to wait for it to be played on stream by "ASA" (or a similar name) before releasing it, showing external factors can influence release timing.

## Key Quotes
- "This is just a remake of an old level, or well, this is just, we're just remaking one area of an old level because I have watched playtesters play it and I realized this area fucking sucks. It was cute, yeah, but it wasn't very fun." (Illustrates iterative design based on playtesting and prioritizing fun.)
- "Quest 13 is going to be an ice castle. On top of a mountain. And it's going to be very gloomy and scary and dark. Or maybe more suspenseful... It was gonna be white and desaturated blues... So it would be pretty bright, but it would be scary and gloomy." (Highlights the conceptualization of new levels and specific atmospheric goals.)
- "Okay, so basically the bug here, the crash that we just ran into, is that it's using the S8 register... This function here decides to overwrite the S8 register with some random local variable. So my current object pointer gets overwritten..." (Shows the technical depth of development and bug-fixing involved.)
- "I don't know if RTYL will be beatable. I'm not really considering that." (Suggests Kaze's focus might be more on the creative vision and challenge than ensuring universal completion.)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Iterative Design Philosophy:** Explore Kaze's process for evaluating player feedback and his willingness to make drastic changes to levels (like the "Boring Red Coin Mission") to improve "fun." How does he balance his vision with external input?
- **Quest 13's Unique Aesthetic:** Delve deeper into the inspiration and intended player experience for the "gloomy but bright" ice castle. What specific feelings or challenges does he aim to evoke with this design?
- **Collaboration and Asset Integration:** Discuss how he works with contributors like Zeina and Biobak. How are art styles aligned, and how are assets integrated into the game to fit his overall vision?
- **Technical Innovation and Risk:** Elaborate on the "fucked up optimization" and other deep engine modifications. What are the benefits and challenges of pushing the SM64 engine this far, and how does it enable his creative goals for RTYI?
- **Open-Sourcing the Engine:** What are Kaze's motivations for planning to make the engine open source? What impact does he hope it will have on the Mario 64 modding community?

## Game Development Process
- The stream focuses on active development, particularly brainstorming and initial design for Courses 13, 14, and 15.
- Course 13 ("gloomy ice castle") is in the art style testing and layout planning phase.
- Course 14 (decided during the stream to be "craft materials" themed) and Course 15 ("space arcade," which already has an area finished) are being planned to ensure thematic coherence and a good difficulty curve.
- Kaze mentions using a "design document" and creating a level overview to manage difficulty and player experience ("to make sure the players learn all the important controls everywhere and that the difficulty has a good curve").
- The game is stated to have "three courses missing" at one point, indicating significant progress but still key areas to complete.
- The development process is highly iterative, especially for level themes and art styles, with Kaze experimenting and seeking chat feedback.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong opinions on emulation: "Project 64 inaccuracies, unfortunately. Right now the game has a lot of issues on a lot of emulators... You can use Parallel Launcher but I hate it."
- He has a clear design philosophy, avoiding puzzles: "Puzzles is very much against the design of this game." and focusing on boss fights as "set pieces."
- Kaze reflects on the N64's original development: "Would SM64 run faster if I recorded in Assembly instead of C? Yes. But it probably still wouldn't have come out because the Nintendo programmers are not good enough to program Mario 64 in Assembly."
- He values the "vibe" and "feeling" of levels, spending considerable time trying to achieve the desired aesthetic, as seen with Course 13.
- He differentiates his on-stream persona from his off-stream personality: "The main reason I try to talk a lot on stream is that I'm trying to be a good streamer. In real life I do not talk very much."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** Not explicitly mentioned by name for specific contributions in this transcript. Kaze does listen to various music tracks for inspiration (e.g., "Ice Castle songs," "Nintendo winter music," "Sonic Adventure") which is relevant to a composer's work.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** Actively contributes ideas in chat. Kaze references Biobak's input: "What Biobank said makes sense to me. It's gonna be the Caterpillar for the Space Casino. It's gonna be dark with lots of glowing lights." This suggests Biobak is involved in conceptual and visual design.
- **Zeina (animations/art):** Kaze confirms his wife (presumably Zeina) "still makes art for this." She is also mentioned in personal anecdotes, and Kaze notes she now works in her own office.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Community/Chat (various users like "Lena," "Fasana"):** Plays a significant role in brainstorming, with Kaze actively soliciting and incorporating their ideas for level themes (e.g., the craft materials theme for Course 14 was heavily shaped by chat suggestions).
    - **Brodude (another SM64 ROM hacker):** Frequently mentioned, often humorously, as a point of reference for design decisions ("Because that is what we base our decisions on. On what Brody already did. Yeah.").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Emulator Incompatibility:** A major recurring challenge is ensuring the game runs correctly on various N64 emulators. "So we currently have some issues in the game on Project 64 where some levels crash... Right now the game has a lot of issues on a lot of emulators."
- **Level Theme and Concept Development:** Significant time is dedicated to brainstorming and finalizing themes for new courses, particularly Course 14 (Craft Materials) and Course 15 (Space Arcade), ensuring they are unique, fit the late-game difficulty, and are engaging.
- **Art Style Realization:** Kaze struggles to achieve the specific "gloomy," "surreal" art style envisioned for Course 13 (Ice Castle), iterating through textures, shaders, fog, and lighting. "The feeling of this place is not right for me. I don't like this. This is not what I envisioned this to be like."
- **Difficulty Pacing and Level Order:** Kaze is consciously planning the level order and difficulty curve to ensure a smooth player experience and proper introduction of mechanics.
- **Boss Design:** For Course 13, the boss (potentially Raphael the Raven) is considered integral to the level's theme and cinematic feel.
- **Technical Limitations:** While pushing visual boundaries, Kaze is mindful of N64 performance, e.g., analyzing the millisecond cost of rendering layers.
- **Avoiding Conventions (selectively):** For the final course (Course 15), Kaze wants to "alter some convention that all the other 30 levels follow," while being cautious about breaking established player expectations like "a retro-pipe in every level."

## Business Aspects
- **Minor Streamer Sponsorships:** Kaze briefly mentions receiving products from "Gamersub" (Gamer Soup) and a pre-workout brand for testing, with the possibility of sponsorship. This appears related to his streaming activities rather than direct funding for the "Return to Yoshi's Island" project. No other specific funding, marketing, or release/distribution plans for the game itself are discussed in this transcript.

## Key Quotes
- "Project 64 inaccuracies, unfortunately. Right now the game has a lot of issues on a lot of emulators. There isn't much I can do about it. Hopefully it just fixes itself magically like usual." (Highlighting a core development frustration)
- "Course 15 needs to be a banger... We want this to be kinda special. We want it to be something that allows for difficulty as well. It should alter some convention that all the other 30 levels follow." (Stating the ambition for the final levels)
- "The feeling of this place is not right for me. I don't like this. This is not what I envisioned this to be like." (Kaze on the art style struggles for Course 13, showcasing the iterative process)
- "I think I can only appreciate boss fights as a set piece. So for me, the number one priority when we make a boss is to make sure it's a cool set piece." (Revealing his philosophy on boss design)

    -   Example: "Oh, Zena's making the raven. That looks pretty nice. I like this."
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Lina:** Mentioned as someone who might be able to create a Blender plugin to emulate N64 texture quantization, per Kaze's suggestion to the chat.
    -   **CrapStorageK5:** Thanked by Kaze for assistance with a material/shader setup in Blender during the stream.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Key Design Decisions:**
    -   The level is an "ice castle" with an "eerie" and "lonely" vibe, intended as a late-game, more hardcore platforming experience.
    -   Stars planned include red coins outside/in a courtyard, a platforming challenge to a star seen early but reached later (inspired by Big Boo's Haunt), and a boss fight with a Raven.
    -   Specific room concepts include "cold haze rooms" (damaging cold with fire safe spots), a U-shaped or H-shaped castle layout with a bridge, rooms with ice wave generators, spinning ice platforms, appearing paths (Mario Galaxy style), and cracking ice blocks.
    -   Exploration of advanced N64 graphical techniques, such as CPU-generated normal maps for ice reflections and dynamic texture scrolling based on camera angle for shine effects.
    -   Color palette: dark blue, light blue, and white.
    -   Enemies: Ice block enemies (Nappy Net inspired), "ice demons" (made up by Kaze), big snowman enemy (rolls head), ravens (from Yoshi's Island).
-   **Challenges & Solutions:**
    -   **Texture Quantization:** A major hurdle is the N64's limited color depth (5-bits per RGB channel) and 1-bit alpha for RGBA16 textures, which can make detailed textures look "like ass." Kaze experiments with different texture formats (e.g., IA8 for 4-bit alpha) and considers a Blender plugin to preview quantization.
    -   **Achieving Realistic Ice Effects:** Experimenting with CPU-generated normal maps and reflection maps to make ice surfaces look genuinely reflective and deep, despite N64 limitations. This is an expensive technique, limiting the number of surfaces it can be applied to.
    -   **Level Layout:** Designing a "confusing, but not frustrating" labyrinthine castle structure.
    -   **Performance:** Balancing visual fidelity and complex mechanics with N64 performance. The new OS is partly aimed at addressing this.

## Business Aspects
-   Kaze explicitly states his intention to release the source code for his projects, including this one: "Yes the source code will release. Despite what people seem to think I will release the source code."
-   While discussing a potential future kart racing engine, Kaze mentions that a simultaneous release on PC and N64 would be "insane advertising," showing some consideration for marketing strategy on other projects.
-   No direct discussion of funding or commercial release plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" itself.

## Key Quotes
-   "So, I was working with Biobank off-stream to try and find an art style for this. We were working very actively. But he had some neat ideas and I had some neat ideas. And I think... I think this is a decent art style for this level here." (On collaboration and art style development)
-   "The idea here is, it's kind of like an eerie ice castle... Kind of a lonely world for Mario, with a lot of enemies. Some more hardcore platforming. So, this is more like, you know, this is the late end of the game." (On the level's theme and difficulty)
-   "Quantization really fucked us over. Holy shit... Mario 64 only has five bits [for R,G,B]... especially for alpha, we only have one bit for alpha, meaning the shine can only be on or off on every pixel." (Highlighting a key technical challenge)
-   "Did I tell you guys that I wrote a new OS for my N64? It's all done now, it's all good... And it gives me a lot more control. We're gonna find a lot of optimizations with the new OS." (On a major technical development)

## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The ROM hack ("the hex") is stated to be "just slightly over 80% done."
- **Current Focus (as per stream):** Development of "Course 13," an ice castle level. This involves greyboxing, creating 3D models for platforming elements, programming their behavior, and refining visual effects.
- **Development Stage:** The stream shows a micro-level iterative design process for specific mechanics within a level that already has a "general outline." This suggests late-stage development where individual components are being polished.
- **Key Milestones Mentioned:**
    - Planning level themes: "We already have the level themes planned."
    - Completing 3 out of 5 areas (mentioned by a chatter, Kaze acknowledges: "The factories and say no, only the office and boss area to go... And those are the smallest areas. So, that sounds pretty promising.") *Self-correction: This quote "3 out of 5 areas done" refers to a chatter's own project, not RTYI directly, though Kaze engages with it. The "80% done" is Kaze's direct statement about his hack.*
    - Kaze is systematically working on platforming elements for the ice level: "make all the platforming pieces, all the 3D models for it. And then to make fun platforming with it."

## Personal Insights
- **Identity as a Creator:** Kaze reflects on being seen as a "YouTuber" versus a "game developer": "Is this actually what my life has been this whole time? I've just been a YouTuber, not a game developer."
- **Design Philosophy:** Expresses strong opinions on official Nintendo games (e.g., Mario 64 DS: "a terrible game"; Yoshi's Island remake: disliking forced character switching), which likely informs his own design choices for "Return to Yoshi's Island" to address perceived flaws.
- **Development Challenges & Self-Doubt:** Articulates the frustration and uncertainty inherent in the creative process, especially with visual effects: "I feel like I've looked at this [ice platform effect] for so long that anything that doesn't look completely jarring at this point looks fine to me... would I hate it? I don't know."
- **Bug Fixing Philosophy:** Believes some bugs might resolve themselves over time or be fixed accidentally during other development work: "sometimes bugs just randomly get fixed like that."
- **Personal Life Impact:** Mentions his impending fatherhood ("going to have a kid in like two months") as a factor influencing other commitments like F3.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No direct mention of Badub or specific music contributions for "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript. Kaze does discuss stream music choices (Super Paper Mario OST, avoiding B3313) and mentions uploading his game's OST in the future.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Actively contributes ideas and assets: "Biobank's appearing path thing, yes. I definitely want that in here."
    - Kaze directly interacts with and iterates on Biobak's work during the stream, specifically a `.blend` file for an ice effect: "Okay, I'll check the blend you sent me... Biobank, is this what you were thinking?"
    - Provides visual solutions and inspiration for elements like the cracking ice platform.
- **Zeina (Animations) / Eiza:** (Kaze uses "Zana" when discussing his child's name, and "Zeina" is a known collaborator. "Eiza" seems to be the same person).
    - Involved in a "special plan" for a release video for "the slide" (a feature in the game), which Eiza wants to be "like a little bit of a documentary thing almost."
    - Has animation plans for game features: "grind rails and we still kind of have an animation plan for those."
    - Kaze comments on her potential as a video editor but notes she might not know the deep technical details of his work.
- **Other Contributors:** No other distinct, named contributors for "Return to Yoshi's Island" are explicitly mentioned as actively developing parts of the game in this transcript. Chat members provide suggestions and feedback.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Design (Ice Castle - Course 13):**
    - Brainstorming specific platforming mechanics: "Ice waves that move forward," "An ice platform that cracks," "Wind gusts," "A spinning ice shard," "Ice path that appears as you get closer."
    - Prioritizing core mechanics: "The ice platform that cracks. The spinning ice shards. And the wind gusts, I think those are the most important ones."
- **Cracking Ice Platform Mechanic:**
    - **Challenge:** Significant time and effort spent on designing, modeling, texturing, and animating a cracking/disappearing ice platform to look and feel right within N64 limitations.
    - **Iteration:** Multiple attempts at textures, shader effects (alpha blending, primitive colors, dithering), and particle effects (triangles, mist).
    - **Solution (in progress):** A multi-stage effect involving texture changes for cracks, a dissolve animation using shader manipulation, and particle effects for shattering. The goal is a 3-step process: initial state, cracked state, and broken/dissolving state.
- **Exploit/Mechanic Removal:** Kaze mentions accidentally fixing/removing a triple jump exploit and is "50-50 on whether I want it in the game."
- **N64 Technical Constraints:** Constant awareness and working within the N64's graphical and processing limitations, evident in discussions about shaders, texture sizes, and animation performance.
- **Atmosphere/Aesthetics:** Focus on making elements visually appealing and fitting the ice theme (e.g., discussion on crack colors, particle effects, reflection maps).

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing & Promotion:**
    - Planning release videos for game features: "Eiza wanted it to make like a little bit of a documentary thing almost... And then I'm making the release video for the slide."
    - Consideration of community showcases: "Actually, I don't know if I can do an F3 this year." (F3 is a major ROM hacking showcase).
    - Creating supplementary content: Developing a "satisfying Mario 64 clips" video, with discussion on effective thumbnails and titles to engage viewers.
- **Funding:** No direct mention of funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island." ROM hacking is typically a non-commercial hobby.

## Game Development Process
- The stream focuses on level design for a castle/mansion area, specifically planning platforming paths and integrating existing mechanics.
- Kaze is working on making the game fun by strategically placing platforming elements.
- Progress includes implementing platforming mechanics like bridges, doors, a "paper kitty" seamless snowflake pattern effect, and an improved "growing path" visual effect.
- A major task is designing the acquisition of the level's first star, ensuring it's visible early to create a sense of mystery.
- The overall structure of the level, including multiple paths, sub-areas (like a frozen lake, prison chambers), and a boss fight area (Raven from Yoshi's Island), is being mapped out.
- Kaze is using the Mario 64 decompilation and tools like Fast64 (for Blender models) and GCC (compiler).
- The process is iterative, with Kaze brainstorming, implementing, and refining ideas live, often in response to chat feedback or self-critique.
- Specific goals for the stream included planning the platforming layout and solving the design challenge for accessing the first star.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong enthusiasm for creative elements he designs, such as the "paper kitty" pattern: "how fucking cool is that? You can't tell me that this is not the coolest thing ever."
- He has opinions on software and operating systems, preferring stability over new features: "I literally never want to update my software ever unless there is something wrong with it cause everytime software updates it introduces new bugs." He is considering switching to Linux due to issues with Windows.
- His game design philosophy prioritizes gameplay over pure aesthetics, though "cool factor" is important: "the theming should be secondary to the gameplay."
- He aims to create a sense of mystery and discovery for the player: "I want that when you enter this area here the first thing you see... is you see a star but you have no idea how to get there and it's it's supposed to like stick in your minds."
- Kaze shows a willingness to discuss personal topics candidly with his audience, such as his knee pain or thoughts on software.
- He values player experience, opting for solutions that are easier for players even if technically simpler to program (e.g., single-axis chandelier).

## Collaborator Information

- Biobak: Mentioned in the context of 3D models. Kaze suspected Biobak might have "snuck a triangle" into a model, indicating Biobak provides graphical assets.
- Zeina: Greets Zeina at the start. Later, Kaze discusses a penguin model with Zeina ("wait zayna i have a sick idea... anime do we want this to look low poly or to be smooth zayna which one do you prefer"), suggesting Zeina contributes 3D models or animations. The "paper kitty" effect was previously shown on Kled's channel or Kaze's Twitter, but Kaze states he invented the pattern.
- Other Contributors:
    - **Samah:** Provided graphical feedback. Kaze: "oh oh samah thank you for the hint samah while you're here do you also want to give me graphical tips..."
    - **Lila (chat member):** Contributed a "banger idea" during the stream. Kaze: "Leela actually had the banger idea today and you missed it."
    - **Kled (Kled's channel):** The "paper kitty" pattern was shown on Kled's channel or Kaze's Twitter; Kled is not explicitly stated as a direct contributor to "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript.
    - **Revo:** Recommended a Linux distribution for setting up the decompilation environment, not a direct game contributor.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Star 1 Acquisition (Central Challenge):**
    - Goal: Player sees Star 1 early but can't reach it immediately, creating a mystery.
    - Discarded ideas for access: Mirror reflecting the star, complex chandelier puzzle to break an ice wall.
    - Considered ideas: Power-up (Bomb Cap, but rejected making it mandatory for Star 1), cannon.
    - Chosen solution: A large snowball, found on an upper platform, which the player rolls down to smash an ice wall concealing the star. This was deemed thematically appropriate and understandable.
- **Chandelier Mechanic:**
    - Concept: A swingable chandelier for platforming, player rocks it to build momentum.
    - Technical challenge: Programming the swing (quaternions vs. simpler single-axis). Kaze opted for single-axis for easier programming and better player experience.
    - Application: Initially considered for breaking the ice wall for Star 1, but later decided to use it for platforming sections elsewhere and for introducing the mechanic in a dedicated room.
- **Level Flow and Layout:**
    - Designing interconnected paths and sub-areas (e.g., "snowman cave path," "cold haze room").
    - Using visual cues like spiral staircases to guide the player's view and create interesting level geometry.
    - Balancing open-ended exploration with clear objectives.
- **Visuals and Effects:**
    - Inventing a "seamless snowflake pattern" for textures.
    - Improving a "growing path" effect to be less abrupt and more visually appealing.
    - Planning distinct theming for different rooms (e.g., lobby, diner, library) post-platforming design.
- **Player Experience:**
    - Avoiding mandatory power-ups for early stars (e.g., Bomb Cap for Star 1).
    - Ensuring new mechanics are introduced clearly to the player.
    - Striving for "cool" and memorable moments.
- **Enemies/NPCs:** Decision made for "only enemies" and "no NPCs."
- **Yoshi Coin Ideas:** Brainstorming collectible challenges, such as smashing an ice statue with a snowball or finding a non-solid wall.

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing for Future Projects:** Kaze views the visibility from his streaming and ROM hacking work as potential "insane advertisement" for his future original game development endeavors. He notes, "marketing seems to be basically like 90 of the equations as making a game course."
- No direct mentions of funding, specific release plans, or distribution for "Return to Yoshi's Island" itself were found in this transcript.

## Key Quotes
- "The guide today, we are trying to design the level today Meaning we use all the platforming mechanics we need And we place them over the level to hopefully have the game be fun."
- "I want that when you enter this area here the first thing you see like within the first five seconds of playing the level is you see a star but you have no idea how to get there and it's it's supposed to like stick in your minds and then like you go through the mansion and you find a way to get to the star eventually."
- "yeah exactly sunbury this will be pretty insane advertisement for whenever i do my own game so and marketing seems to be basically like 90 of the equations as making a game course."
- "Okay you know what we don't have yet? Sure now we have a layout that kind of works, but what we don't have is, how the fuck did you break the ice block? We did all that just to dodge the question." (Illustrating the iterative problem-solving for the Star 1 puzzle).

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Evolution of the "Mystery Star":** Explore the detailed thought process behind designing the first star's accessibility, from the initial concept of early visibility to the final snowball solution, including why other ideas like the mirror or chandelier puzzle were discarded.

## Game Development Process
- The stream focuses on the level design of an "Ice Castle" for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Current stage involves "grey-boxing" or "blocking out" the level, prioritizing platforming mechanics, level flow, and connections between areas before detailed visual work. Kaze states: "Our task for the day is to make the platforming good. And then after we made the platforming good. We can make the visuals good."
- Iterative development is evident: Kaze builds sections, tests them, identifies issues (e.g., camera, jump difficulty, layout dead-ends), and refines them live.
- Progress includes defining objectives (star locations) and ensuring the overall structure of the castle level functions as intended (e.g., "recap all the stars real quick and see if we have a decent layout now").
- Specific mechanics being implemented and tested include slide jumps, momentum jumps, snowball puzzles, and a "mirror Mario" wall-kick concept inspired by chat.
- Consideration of N64 hardware limitations is constant, particularly regarding rendering complexity (e.g., "I don't want to render that many Mario's") and memory ("stay within the 64 megabytes limit").
- Plans to import "Sauron's Trace," a performance analysis tool, to help optimize the game.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze emphasizes designing for a specific "feeling": "I think making a game is all about designing a feeling that you want the player to have." This guides his acceptance or rejection of design ideas.
- He aims for a difficulty level comparable to vanilla Mario 64 but with more consistent controls: "Difficulty probably around vanilla Mario 64... But the controls in this game are a lot more consistent."
- His philosophy on difficulty includes player agency: "the game is as difficult as you make it... the game is as difficult as you are brave."
- Kaze expresses a preference for simple and effective programming: "Programming is something you do to build something. The act of it itself should be as simple as possible."
- He has a clear stance on source code release: "I released the source code whenever my mods done because if I release it before then I dig my whole mod so I don't want that." This is to ensure the mod is experienced as a complete product.
- He discusses his work process, including how streaming can help with focus, despite the dual task of working and engaging chat.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** Referred to as "Biobank" in chat and "Biomech" when Kaze considers his graphical idea. Biobak/Biomech suggested a texture/effect for bottomless pits: "Let's give biomech's idea and try here..."

- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Dan:** Mentioned as someone Kaze talked to about materials/shaders: "I was playing with materials a little bit more after talking to Dan."
    - **Eiza:** Collaborated with Kaze on past projects ("Royal Skyrim game," "Scuttlebug hack"), where Eiza handled much of his own art/models, and Kaze did programming, shaders, and slides. Eiza's models were used in the "Scuttlebug" hack.
    - **Sauron:** Developed a performance tracing tool ("Sauron's Trace") that Kaze plans to integrate.
    - **Easy As Pie:** Created the N64 GCC (compiler) fork that Kaze uses.
    - **Lila (chat mod):** Shared a video about a neural network running on N64, sparking a discussion.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Camera Issues:** A recurring challenge is camera behavior, especially in tight indoor spaces or during complex platforming. "Which the camera here still sucks. But I'm going to fix that."
- **Level Layout and Flow:** Significant time is spent ensuring areas connect logically, players can navigate intuitively, and dead-ends or overly frustrating sections are addressed. This includes adding ways back to main areas and adjusting geometry when "running out of level... physical space."
- **Visuals vs. Performance:** Balancing desired visual effects (e.g., ice materials, mirror reflections, special pit textures) with N64 capabilities. Kaze experiments with effects but is mindful of performance ("I don't want to render that many Mario's").
- **Thematic Consistency:** Decisions are made to align with the "Ice Castle" theme, such as changing proposed jail cells to "frozen walls and there's people behind the frozen walls" based on chat feedback.
- **Mechanic Integration:** Exploring how different mechanics (slides, momentum jumps, wind effects, potential "mirror Mario") can be combined and used effectively within the level.
- **Player Guidance and Difficulty:** Adjusting "leap of faith" jumps to be less punishing, and ensuring difficulty stems from skill rather than obscure design. The goal is "vanilla Mario 64" difficulty but with more reliable controls.
- **Iterative Problem Solving:** When a section is not working ("Okay, that jump is entirely impossible. That jump is just never going to happen. I guess you can do that. Yeah, this section sucks."), Kaze immediately works on redesigning or tweaking it.

## Business Aspects
- **Source Code Release Strategy:** Kaze plans to release the source code for "Return to Yoshi's Island" only after the mod is completed to maintain the integrity of the project and how it's first experienced.
- **Monetization of Past Projects/Channel:** Kaze mentions selling a physical cartridge of a previous fan project ("Valuigi's Tango Stand cartridge, which netted me $600") and views tools like the RetroBlaster as an "investment" for his YouTube channel, which is his primary platform for showcasing work.
- **Professional Work:** Kaze mentions he is "actually already working in Unreal Engine 5 for a different company," indicating separate professional game development activities.
- No direct marketing, specific funding, or distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island" itself are discussed in this transcript beyond the eventual source code release.

## Game Development Process
- Currently working on "Course 11 at 13 the ice castle" and an enemy called "the freezy."
- Recently completed work on an "oil level" and a new video.
- The game is planned to have 15 main courses. Kaze mentions being "in quest 13 out of 15," indicating significant progress on core level creation, but also states the project will likely take "two years or so" more to complete.
- Development involves level design, enemy mechanics (e.g., Freezy's ice breath), visual effects (spline lights, particles), UI optimization, and significant bug fixing.
- A new feature, "spline light," was recently implemented and showcased.
- Kaze is actively uploading ROMs to an N64 for testing, though sometimes encounters crashes.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze values player experience and "feel" highly, as seen in his deliberation over the dive mechanic: "I agree it feels really good... I think that might still feel good and be like more in line with with the rest of the game."
- He aims for a game where players can "pick your own difficulty where you can go for risky jumps and like do the difficult thing or you can do the easy thing whenever you want."
- He expresses frustration with aspects of development ("This really really sucks" regarding a bug) but also excitement for new creations ("Isn't that fucking sick?" about spline lights).
- He is preparing for fatherhood, with his daughter Reyna due in four weeks, which will involve parental leave and potentially more streaming.
- Kaze reflects on his creative process for videos: "My engine is mostly I'm gonna be moving to one level design one of these. I know is what you give for making a collect-a-thon Stunning adventure is all about freedom..."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Contributed ideas for visual elements, such as "how the dots move depending on how the platform moves that was biobank's idea."
    - Kaze values Biobak's art style: "I just kind of tried to do it in the style that biobank was making the stuff but I Think you could probably make it look better."
    - Collaborates on aesthetic ideas, e.g., Biobak suggested putting Z and R on caps for Zena and Reyna.
- **Zeina (Animations, close associate):**
    - Joined the stream call. The name of Kaze's upcoming daughter, Reyna, is in homage to a friend of Zena's who passed away.
    - Kaze mentions, "We always name ourselves Kazena in video games," indicating a close bond. Specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are not detailed in this segment.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Dan:** "Dan even helped me look into this a little bit to get a proper effect going" (referring to a wall effect).
    - **"Salvato" (Game Designer):** Kaze mentions discussing game design with him previously regarding Mario 64's dive mechanic, indicating Kaze seeks external design perspectives.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Dive Mechanic Re-evaluation:** Kaze is considering nerfing Mario's dive by limiting angle changes to make it less of a "trivializing" mechanic for level design, while still feeling good. He states, "the logic goes through the dive you are kinda making a lot of level design trivial."
- **Star Count and Variety:** The game is planned to have around 180 stars. This includes ~130 main stars, Overworld stars, "Yoshi missions" (e.g., timed challenges, limited jumps, find a teddy bear, beat a level as Minamaru), and a potential "Emerald Hunt" style mission inspired by Sonic Adventure. Kaze is actively brainstorming and refining these: "See that's my issue. Trying to get Wonder Guns without dying in a level."
- **Enemy Design (Freezy):** Developing the Freezy's ice breath attack, including visual effects for inhaling (sucking in snow) and exhaling (shooting ice). Iterating on particle effects to achieve the desired look (cone vs. cylinder, type of particles).
- **Camera Issues:** Actively working to fix camera problems, e.g., "I should put like a hole in here so that when you do this the camera doesn't get fucky."
- **Bug Fixing:** Encountered and worked on several bugs during the stream, including a missing visual effect in the "factory" area and a ROM crash on boot.
- **Accessibility/Difficulty Modes:** Briefly discussed a "sightseeing mode" with no HP, or altering Mario's physics (slower, less gravity) for an easier experience, but leans towards players choosing their difficulty through gameplay choices rather than explicit modes: "I would want the difficulty selection to be like choose your own adventure where you just play the game and then you can make more difficult jumps."

## Business Aspects
- **Funding:** Acknowledges Patreon support ("Sub man I joined your patreon nice being gamer. That's cool").
- **Marketing/Community Engagement (YouTube):** Considers hiring a video editor ($16/minute) to increase his YouTube video output, which he sees as "hard bottlenecked by my unwillingness to make videos."
- **Release/Distribution Risks:** Jokes about Nintendo potentially trying to "arrest" him if offered a job, highlighting an awareness of the legal status of ROM hacks.

## Key Quotes
- "I want the game to not be difficult I want it to be like pick your own difficulty where you can go for risky jumps and like do the difficult thing or you can do the easy thing whenever you want it's kind of my thought process here." (Kaze on his game design philosophy for difficulty)
- "We're in quest 13 out of 15, so we're almost done already. Well, almost done. It's probably still going to be like two years or so, I don't know." (On project progress and timeline)
- "so recently I was talking to a different game designer than salvato you might know him and he was saying that he thinks that the dive is kind of antithetical to the rest of Mario 64 the ground pop dive here he really doesn't like it and I think I kind of see his point." (Showing reflection on core mechanics and external influences)

## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress & Stability:** Kaze has been refactoring the "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTUI) codebase, resulting in improved stability and getting the game to work on N64 hardware again. Many crashes have been fixed.
- **Current Stage:** Kaze is working on the 13th level. Significant work remains, including boss levels, two side levels, a "huge part of the overworld," followed by bug testing and beta testing.
- **New Systems/Optimizations:**
    - A new system for rendering HUD elements has been implemented, saving "a few precious microseconds in every level" and providing a global performance gain.
    - Kaze has an idea for another optimization: putting frame buffers into separate memory segments, potentially yielding a 2-3% performance boost (equating to a full FPS).
- **Content Creation:** This stream focused on developing the "Raven" enemy for an ice-themed level, including its model import, behavior programming (spawning, movement, turning, attacking), and visual appearance (ice material).
- **Development Tools/Environment:** The game is based on the Mario 64 decompilation project. Kaze uses tools like Blender for animations/models and Fast64. He codes in C.

## Personal Insights
- **Game Design Philosophy:** Kaze states, "To me, games is about experiencing new ideas and concepts." He expresses a preference for games that offer novelty over those that feel "very samey" (referring to some types of ROM hacks).
- **Perception of Game Development:** He describes the effort involved poetically: "Making this game is honestly like scaling 50 Everests. That pretty much encapsulates how I feel about making video games."
- **Openness and Honesty:** Kaze is frank about challenges ("This is gonna be a complicated enemy to program"), bugs, and his own state (e.g., being tired). He also openly discusses design decisions and seeks community feedback.
- **Pride in Technical Skill:** He confidently discusses low-level N64 details, assembly, and memory addresses, reflecting deep technical knowledge.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** While Badub is not directly named as contributing in this transcript, Kaze refers to himself as a "music director" who gives "directions" for the music. He also discusses OST choices, indicating ongoing music development for the game.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** The prompt identifies Biobak as a graphics artist. In this transcript, a viewer named "Biobank" (who may or may not be the same person) made a significant design suggestion for the Raven enemy: having them pop out of the ground/ice, which Kaze adopted for being "cooler and easier to program." No specific graphical asset contributions from "Biobak" are detailed in this particular segment.
- **Zeina (Animations/Models):**
    - Provided the 3D model for the Raven enemy: "Zena you sent me the model, right?"
    - Created animations, such as a "dilly dally" animation mentioned for the Raven.
    - Kaze discusses texture issues ("What did Lena do?") and model orientation with reference to Zeyna's work. Zeyna also provides input on the Raven's material and color (e.g., "The beak and the feet should be more green").

    - **Michi Michi:** "Michi Michi I looked at your functions yesterday. I integrated some of them. It's pretty good." (Contribution: Code functions).
    - **Dan Salvato:** "So I talked to Dan Salvato and he said that the dive jump we have is kind of like against the design of Mario 64 and I can kind of see it." (Contribution: Design feedback on a core mechanic).
    - **Viewers (general):** Kaze frequently interacts with viewers, taking suggestions for enemy ideas and discussing design choices.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Raven Enemy Design:**
    - **Initial Concept & Iteration:** Planned to walk on geometry and turn. This was deemed "a complicated enemy to program."
    - **Revised Concept (influenced by Biobank):** Ravens will now pop out of the ground/ice, walk a path, and then disappear. This is "cooler and easier to program."
    - **Appearance:** Decided they should be made of ice (using a material similar to "freezies") with distinct colors for parts, rather than snow. The boss version ("Raffle the Raven") will be an actual raven, likely black, and incorporate moon/cosmic elements.
    - **Behavior:** Programmed to spawn from surfaces, move forward, turn at set points or when hitting walls/no ground, and eventually despawn. Their attack will damage Mario.
- **Dive Jump Mechanic:**
    - **Challenge:** Received feedback from Dan Salvato that the existing dive jump (allowing mid-air angle changes) is unlike other SM64 moves and potentially too powerful or abusable by skilled players, while not helping bad players.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Kaze is considering limiting the dive jump to provide only a small angle change, making it a minor advantage for experienced players rather than a powerful corrective tool. He solicited viewer opinions on this.
- **Level Design (Ice Level):** Described as a "surreal ice palace" with "some mindfuck stuff going on." It's intended to be "kind of like a mace-like level [maze-like]" with different paths and obstacles.
- **Optimization & Performance:** A constant consideration, with new HUD rendering systems and plans for frame buffer optimization to maintain N64 performance.
- **Bug Fixing:** Addressed issues like Ravens falling through the floor, incorrect spawning, shadow rendering problems, and animation glitches live on stream. Kaze also identified an issue with Fast64 regarding order of operations affecting exported values.
- **Player Experience:** Kaze discusses making enemies feel right, ensuring interactions are fun (e.g., bouncing on wall-walking Ravens for a Yoshi coin), and considering player feedback for mechanics like shaking ice when frozen.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Timeline:** Kaze estimates the game might be "maybe two to three years more or so" from release, acknowledging it's a long-term project.
- **Streaming as Engagement:** The stream itself is a form of engagement, with Kaze having a regular weekly schedule. Viewer interactions like "cum shake" redemptions (a channel point feature) are part of this, though not direct funding for game development.
- **No Explicit Commercial Plans:** As a ROM hack, there's no discussion of commercial sale or traditional marketing campaigns. The focus is on creation and community sharing.

## Game Development Process
- The game is in an advanced development stage, with Kaze working on "Course 13."
- A significant focus is on performance optimization, utilizing a new profiler/trace tool created by "Sauron." The profiler revealed that ~76% of game time was idle, and identified RSP bottlenecks.
- A major technical milestone was overcoming a memory limitation issue when creating a large slide, which resulted in gaining 400 microseconds of computing time through a new memory allocation method.
- Asset integration from collaborators (like Biobak) is ongoing, followed by refinement and debugging by Kaze.
- Kaze is actively working on enemy AI and pathing (e.g., Wiggler).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses excitement and appreciation for new development tools like the profiler: "You guys have no idea how useful this is."
- He acknowledges the difficulty of certain development tasks: "You guys have no idea how much trouble making this slide gave me."
- Kaze shows a mix of frustration with technical issues ("The crazy thing is the RDP runs just a little bit longer than the GFX right now, which shouldn't be the case... that's not good. It means we're RSP bottlenecked.") and satisfaction when solving problems or seeing improvements.
- He reflects on his design choices, such as drawing inspiration from "Jolly Roger Bay" for a section in Course 13.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Biobak:
    - Provides significant graphical assets, including models and textures for "Oily Boily Bay" and various characters/enemies (Womps, Tox Boxes, Koopas).
    - Contributes to optimization by, for example, reducing materials ("Goal new design and one fewer material") and bone count in models ("Made both legs use the same bone, saves one bone. Baked helmet strap into the texture saves one material").
    - Kaze reviews and integrates Biobak's assets, sometimes requiring further tweaks or bug fixing.
- Zeina: Greeted as a viewer ("Yo, hello Zena"). No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this transcript.

- "Funny thing about RTYI, 25 out of 33 milliseconds are spent on a while 1 loop. It's all idle. It's around 76% of the entire game, it's just the game doing nothing at all." (Highlighting a major performance insight from the new profiler.)
- "When I first made this slide I ran out of memory. And because of that I did the whole memory allocation thing that I talked about earlier... And because of that we gained 400 microseconds of computing time." (Describing a significant technical challenge and solution.)
- "In Mario 64 you have 4096 angles. In this game you have 65336 angles. The controls are about 8 times more precise... If you use the exact same setup it likely won't work the exact same way." (Detailing a core gameplay change with wide-ranging implications.)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The development and impact of Sauron's profiler on optimizing "Return to Yoshi's Island."

## Game Development Process
- The game, "Return to Yoshi's Island," is in a late stage of development, with Kaze working on "course 13" and stating "then it's just two levels missing."
- Significant time is spent on bug fixing and performance optimization, with Kaze mentioning he "almost finished my to-do list regarding bugs and performance issues."
- Development includes creating new features like anti-aliasing and achieving "infinite drawing distance even on 64" for certain levels.
- Kaze regularly tests the game on actual N64 hardware to assess performance and identify hardware-specific bugs (e.g., a pipe that "never worked on N64" now functions).
- The current focus for "course 13" (an icy castle/snowman path level) is on finalizing platforming, with aesthetic work and bug fixing to follow off-stream. Kaze hopes to "finish this level in the next month or so."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses significant pride and satisfaction in his work, stating, "I'm especially so happy with oilyboilybay" and, somewhat hyperbolically about the game's quality, "Yes, somehow I'm more proud of this than of the child. What can I say? I'm an artist."
- He has a strong artistic philosophy: "I think a better way is you think about what feeling do I want to create and then you look at your tools and you look at how you can use your tools to create that feeling. You don't want to operate on principles because if you operate on principles, you make art for critics, you don't make art for the sake of it being experienced."
- Kaze values creative freedom, suggesting ROM hacks can be "a little more creative" than mainstream games because "RomEx don't have to sell well."
- He is confident in his technical abilities, often stating he can fix issues or "invent a solution" for technical challenges.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific mention of Badub's contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript. Kaze discusses music implementation generally (MIDI, MP3/WAV imports, ADPCM).
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** Biobak is credited with ideas and models, such as the Fuzzies in protective gear: "This was Biobank's idea and Biobank made the model." Kaze also acknowledges Biobak's artistic contributions when discussing level aesthetics ("Maybe you like Biobank's part more than mine").
- **Zeina (animations):** Known for animations (as per prompt). In this transcript, Zeina (Kaze's partner) is mentioned in a personal context (e.g., "She is currently upstairs with Xena's mom," "Do you think our daughter will be able to play Super Mario Star World? I'm sorry Zena."). Her specific animation contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are not detailed in this segment.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - An unnamed "guy editing my last video" (a technical video about render matrices).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Camera Issues:** Large levels can cause camera problems ("I think this level is a little too big and that's why the camera does this... I might have to invent a solution to that problem"). This was addressed by "bring[ing] everything in a little bit. So that the camera issue doesn't pop up."
- **Level Design and Flow:** Kaze actively refines platforming sections to improve gameplay feel, e.g., adjusting snowman obstacles ("These ones should probably be a little more parallel to each other. Because the wall kicks are otherwise a bit awkward") and re-evaluating jumps ("I'm not sure if I like this jump either. It's not a difficult jump, but it's a little awkward").
- **Technical Limitations:** Encountering issues with existing tools, such as a "snow combiner" for textures in the ice level ("this snow combiner is way too messed up to work with I'm gonna have to make up something new").
- **Performance on N64:** Constantly monitoring and optimizing framerate, and adding features like anti-aliasing while aiming for good performance on original hardware.
- **Balancing Difficulty:** Adjusting level elements to ensure they are challenging but fair (e.g., "Considering that this is too difficult. Let's make it easier").

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing/Promotion:** Kaze uses his technical streams and videos as a way to preview game progress: "So whenever I make a preview, it's like Look how I used this new feature on the N64 to make this level... I have to let people know that I'm still making progress on the hack."
- **Release Plans:** He intends to release the game directly and states, "No, my game never will show up in F3."
- **Monetization/Distribution:** Kaze clarifies he is "not allowed to sell real cartridges." However, he plans to "make a box and a book inlet without any Nintendo references to it and put that out so you can at least get the box as a souvenir." He anticipates "illegally manufactured cartridges by other people" might become available.
- **Addressing C&D Concerns:** Kaze dismisses the idea that showing fan games leads to C&D notices from Nintendo, arguing against self-censorship: "If you make a fan game and you shut up about it and you don't show anyone, you CND'd yourself. Why are you doing Nintendo's job for them?"

## Key Quotes
- "This is what the N64 games could have looked like. You were robbed. With all these options, too." - Kaze, on the enhanced visual capabilities of his hack running on N64.
- "I think a better way is you think about what feeling do I want to create and then you look at your tools and you look at how you can use your tools to create that feeling." - Kaze, on his game design and art philosophy.
- "I hope I can finish this level in the next month or so and then it's just two levels missing. Guys, can you imagine?" - Kaze, on the progress of "Return to Yoshi's Island."

## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The game is significantly into development. Kaze mentions being on "course 13 right now" and states, "We are currently like 120 stars done and we're working on the overworld and the enemies. So it's getting pretty close. We have probably around 30% of the enemies in now."
- **Content Creation:** A substantial amount of content is complete or in progress, including "98 songs in the game."
- **Current Focus (during stream):** Designing the boss fight for Raphael the Raven, including the arena, mechanics, and visual set-piece. Importing and looping music for Course 13 (Ice Castle/Dungeon).
- **Development Stages:** Kaze describes a typical workflow: "Surely you know that the levels always look like shit at the beginning and then look better at the end." This indicates an iterative process from rough concept to polished level.
- **Tooling:** Uses Blender with a Python script called Fast64 for modeling and level geometry. Sac64 is used for the M64 MIDI-like music format.

## Personal Insights
- **Design Philosophy (Mario 64):** "Mario 64 is about freedom and exploration. Being directed to that heavily would, I think, ruin a lot of it."
- **Design Philosophy (Bosses):** "But it being a cool set-piece is my number one priority for bosses, always."
- **Iterative Process:** "Surely you know that the levels always look like shit at the beginning and then look better at the end." He embraces that initial versions might not be perfect.
- **On Community Perception:** "A lot of people seem surprised that the level actually looks good now. Apparently, everyone thought that level is going to be complete ass. And I don't know. I don't know why you don't have confidence in me by now."
- **On Releasing Games:** "I can't release it before it's finished, unfortunately. Because then I would release an unfinished product. The thing that everybody hates EA for."
- **On Objectives:** "The fun is to control Mario itself. Whereas in this, it's like the objective itself, like exploring what the objective is, is part of the fun."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):**
    - Highly praised by Kaze: "Badoub's music is great. The creativity he brings to the table is very, very sick."
    - Contributes significantly to the game's OST.
- **Biobak (Graphics/Concept Artist):**
    - Provided a video concept for the Raphael the Raven boss fight: "Let me just see if I can find the video that bio back had sent me here a while ago... This is what he was thinking. That's so cool."
- **Zeina (Animations):**
    - Mentioned in the context of animation work, with Kaze stating, "Of course, Zeyna has a lot more work with it than I do," implying a significant animation workload, possibly related to a "baby" character mentioned by chat.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Arthur:** Kaze mentions, "I'm going to ask Arthur for his planetary gravity code because he already knows what to do, I think," suggesting Arthur is a programmer with expertise in specific mechanics.
    - **Orion:** Mentioned in relation to past help with importing stream sounds: "This is from that time. I became friends with Orion."
    - **Dot Star Mony (also referred to as "star money"):** Composed music for Kaze's past mods (e.g., "Colossal Circuits") and apparently developed tools for music conversion. "Well, eventually Dot Star Money wrote his own tool to convert the songs and those songs turned out insane."
    - **Yellow or Jesse:** Mentioned as the creator of a "beach demo."
    - **Pablo:** Kaze speculates, "Did Pablo make this import?" regarding a texture, suggesting Pablo might be involved in asset porting.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Raphael the Raven Boss Fight Design:**
    - Extensive brainstorming during the stream, considering multiple phases, mechanics (falling into the sky, dodging stars, landing on a moon, enemy attacks, damaging the boss with "frozen cheese ninja stars").
    - Technical constraint: "That we need to make sure that the things we add can be done entirely on an actor level. And to do the hollow moon properly, we would need to make a change to how gravity works like universally, which I don't want." This led to focusing on an "outside the moon" fight.
    - Visuals: "So him blocking the moon in the intro cutscene, that's a given. We 100% want that."
- **Camera System:**
    - Acknowledged issues: "I think we have a few issues with poopy camera in here." "Well, okay, the camera definitely can't clip through the wall there. That's going to ruin the whole thing."
    - Challenges with implementing analog camera: "Okay, well, how am I supposed to add analog camera to this? Considering we only have one analog stick. There's a little bit of an issue here. On the feasibility side."
- **Music Implementation:**
    - Uses a MIDI-like format (M64 via Sac64) for 80-90% of the OST and streamed music for the rest.
    - Detailed process of finding loop points for a streamed track ("Ice Tunnel song") and calculating sample numbers for looping in-game.
- **Fog System Bugs:** "Yeah, there's a Fast64 bug that makes Geomode's fog always on. Even though it shouldn't be. It happens when you use material bleeding, unfortunately."
- **Star/Collectible Pacing:** Discussion about how to handle collectibles like Yoshi coins and 100-coin stars, preferring systems that don't force players to recollect everything if they exit a level, potentially drawing inspiration from Banjo-Kazooie notes.
- **Scope and Content Comparison:** "There's going to be like, I think, 180 stars on top of that [75 Yoshi coins]. So I guess content-wise, it's probably going to be pretty comparable to, or maybe more [than Odyssey], I don't know, hard to say."

## Business Aspects
- **Release Strategy:** "I can't release it before it's finished, unfortunately." "Nope, I don't have an S-word [release date] for the game coming out. I'll just finish the game at my pace and then it's going to come out."
- **Funding/Marketing:** No explicit mention of funding sources or dedicated marketing plans, which is typical for ROM hacking projects. The stream itself serves as a form of community engagement and progress showcase.
- **Demo Plans:** "I'm still thinking of doing a demo is just Chris one [Course 1]."

## Key Quotes

*Extracted on: 20240810*

## Game Development Process
- The stream focuses heavily on the development and debugging of a specific boss fight: Raphael the Raven on a moon-like planet.
- Key tasks include fixing hurtboxes, implementing boss scaling (visual and hitbox), coding attack patterns (shockwaves, meteors), and adjusting difficulty.
- Kaze is working on a cutscene for Mario and Raphael the Raven's transition to the moon, involving camera work and object movement.
- A significant portion of the stream involves trying to solve how the player returns from the moon level, initially attempting a pipe, then opting to spawn a star directly on the moon.
- He mentions the game being "just over 80 percent" complete.
- Regular activities include compiling code, testing in-game, and identifying/fixing bugs live.
- Kaze is creating complex interactions on a planetary surface, which involves 3D mathematics (matrices, quaternions) for object placement and orientation.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses frustration with "bureaucracy" (seemingly unrelated to the game itself but affecting his mental state).
- He comments on the dichotomy of player feedback regarding difficulty: "Dude, that's fucked up, the comments I get on my YouTube is either like, oh wow, this level looks way too easy, or oh wow, this level looks way too hard. No one ever says Kaze, the difficulty of this looks perfect to me."
- He shows a pragmatic approach to problem-solving, sometimes abandoning complex solutions for simpler ones: "I think the pipe sucks. It sucks programming wise. And it's also not really very visually clear... you know what i'm just gonna spawn the star on top of the moon. i think that's the easiest way to do it."
- Kaze is passionate about the Yoshi's Island theme: "This is Yoshi's Island." and praises its OST.
- He finds questions about the release date annoying: "When people harass me about the release date..."
- He reflects on the difficulty of certain programming tasks: "You guys have no idea how fucked programming this was."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No direct mention of Badub in this transcript. Kaze plays and praises the "Yoshi's Island OST," indicating its influence or use.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Kaze expresses excitement for Biobak's potential contributions to the boss fight's visual appeal: "Dude, Biobank, you can make this fight look so fucking cool with the background. Imagine the whole background here just rotating around."
    - He also mentions a specific visual effect for an intro sequence that Biobak is presumably involved with: "I'm still planning to put that in biobank [cool effect from intro]".
- **Zeina/Zayna (animations):**
    - Credited with some initial logic for an "explosive meteor": "I think Zeyna made it. I just made some small changes..."
    - Kaze states Zayna is actively working on animations: "yeah zena is currently working on all the animations we need..." and later confirms "you sent the animations okay um unfortunately that's gonna be a next time thing".
    - Animations are a known pending task: "it doesn't have any damage. I don't know how to do animations yet. We're working on it."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Okayo (video editor):** Kaze mentions paying Okayo to edit his YouTube videos: "It's someone I paid to edit the video. And hopefully he can edit the next few videos for me."
    - **Chat users (e.g., "serveredited"):** Occasionally offer suggestions or engage in discussions that Kaze responds to.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boss Fight Mechanics (Raphael Raven):**
    - The boss scales up visually and in hitbox size upon taking damage.
    - The boss's attack patterns (speed, frequency of shockwaves) intensify as it takes damage.
    - **Challenge/Solution:** Difficulty balancing is a major concern. Kaze implements a dynamic difficulty where the boss slows down more over time or after certain attacks, making it progressively easier if the player struggles: "we make it slower the longer the fight goes. That way, everyone is guaranteed to beat eventually."
- **Level Progression/Exit (Post-Boss):**
    - **Challenge:** Implementing a pipe for Mario to exit the moon level proved difficult due to rotation and programming complexity.
    - **Decision:** Kaze opts for a simpler solution: spawning the star directly on the moon after the boss is defeated. "you know what i'm just gonna spawn the star on top of the moon. i think that's the easiest way to do it."
- **Hub World Design:**
    - The hub world will be themed after "Yoshi's Tropical Island" from Mario Party.
    - Progression in the overworld will be unlocked using collected coins, e.g., paying to build a bridge or grow a tree.
- **Planetary Mechanics:**
    - **Challenge:** Ensuring objects like the Raven egg, coins, and the exit star correctly orient and stay fixed to the surface of the (presumably spherical and moving) moon. This involves complex 3D math: "how to move the coins into the coordinate system of the planet..."
- **Cutscene Design:**
    - **Challenge:** Creating a compelling and clear cutscene for Mario and Raphael Raven traveling to the moon, involving iterative adjustments to camera angles, focus, and movement paths.
- **Hitbox/Hurtbox Issues:** A recurring technical challenge is ensuring hitboxes and hurtboxes work correctly and scale appropriately with character models.

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube Content Strategy:** Kaze is considering producing more YouTube videos on topics like specific glitches or mechanics in Mario 64 (e.g., "how does the BLG in R64 work," "how do the paintings work").
- **Motivation for Content:** He states, "I'm gonna make more money for my family," suggesting a financial motivation for increasing video output.
- **Leveraging Paid Help:** The hiring of Okayo as a video editor is intended to facilitate easier and higher quality video production: "Especially now that I have a video editor. Wouldn't make it very easy to do."
- **Monetization:** The stream includes mentions of donations from viewers.
- **Release Date Management:** Kaze actively avoids discussing or committing to a release date due to harassment.

## Key Quotes
- "Dude, Biobank, you can make this fight look so fucking cool with the background. Imagine the whole background here just rotating around. How cool is that gonna be?" (Highlighting collaboration and vision for visual spectacle)
- "It's very hard to find the correct velocity there, because if you set it to 0, the fight is laughably easy, and if you set it like what I have right now, it's a little too hard." (On the challenge of game balance)
- "I've been thinking I should make a lot more videos... Stuff that is not super insane tech stuff but that might have a massive view... Especially now that I have a video editor." (Regarding content strategy and leveraging help)
- "The hub world is gonna be Yoshi's Island, of course. You know the Maori Party Board? Yoshi's Tropical Island, where there's fruits everywhere? I want it like that. And the idea is that with the coins that you buy... you can unlock progression in the overworld." (Describing the vision for the hub world)

## Game Development Process
-   Ongoing iterative work on specific game areas, focusing on visual improvements (colors, skybox, thematic elements like the "birdhouse" concept) and level design.
-   A major upcoming milestone is the planned release of a public demo featuring "Course 1." This demo is intended to gather player feedback specifically on new physics and camera systems.
-   The demo release is tentatively scheduled within 3-8 weeks from the stream date, with an accompanying questionnaire (Google Doc) for players.
-   Existing content (like Course 1) is being polished and refined in preparation for the demo.
-   Kaze maintains a YouTube video production schedule, with an editor assisting, to share progress and build anticipation, aligning video releases with development milestones like the demo.
-   Debugging of N64 code is done using NEMU, which allows viewing assembly code.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze is highly self-critical of his work, constantly evaluating and seeking to improve visual aesthetics and gameplay feel (e.g., "something about the colours here just look really good, I think this is really colourful, but the colours don't really pop").
-   He values thematic consistency, ensuring elements fit the "Yoshi's Island" motif.
-   Kaze expresses a strong desire for player feedback to validate and refine game mechanics, particularly core elements like physics and camera controls ("I want more data on gameplay... So that when I release the full game, we know for sure people like the camera and the physics.").
-   He openly shares personal reflections, including moments of self-doubt, concerns about cognitive function ("I've started to feel like my brain is really stupid"), and the impact of personal life (e.g., having a small child makes planning difficult).
-   He has a clear vision for how certain mechanics should feel, leading to detailed adjustments (e.g., the sliding speed soft cap).

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (composer):** While not explicitly named as the composer for the music played during *this* stream, Kaze praises the music ("I love this music too, the music's so good"), and Badub is his known long-term collaborator for music.
-   **Biobak (graphics artist, referred to as "Biomech" or "biobank" in transcript):** Actively engaged in discussion with Kaze during the stream, providing feedback on visuals. Kaze seeks Biobak's opinion on graphical elements ("oh are you sure you don't want this biobank, I think this looks really good now"). This indicates Biobak's involvement in the game's art and visual design.
-   **Zeina (animations):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Violet:** Credited with an idea regarding level aesthetics ("this was Violet's idea, maybe the colours are ok but can be better" - referring to "Minecraft blocks").
    -   **Lila3TV (Lila/Leela):** A very active chat participant who Kaze frequently interacts with. Provides real-time reactions, suggestions (e.g., "Use RS" for emulators), and engages in banter. Kaze playfully asks her to "fix" Blender issues.
    -   **Editor (unnamed):** Kaze mentions having an editor who helps produce his YouTube videos, allowing for more frequent uploads.
    -   **"Redacted" (chat member):** Suggested a "cannon that goes to the sky" idea for level traversal.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Visual Design Iteration:** Significant time spent discussing and attempting to improve the visual appeal of a specific area, including colors, skybox (making it "Yoshi's Island related"), and overall theme (transforming an area into a "birdhouse"). Challenges include color matching, avoiding "clone vomit," and ensuring elements look cohesive.
-   **Mechanics Refinement:**
    -   **Sliding:** Updated sliding mechanics from vanilla Mario 64, implementing a soft cap at 95 speed instead of a hard cap at 100, to allow players to maintain momentum better.
    -   **Level Traversal/Progression:** Extensive discussion and live experimentation on replacing a simple pipe/hard-to-find slide with a new, more thematic mechanic for reaching a high area. This evolved into a "growing flower/vine" concept from Yoshi's Island. Challenges included:
        -   Making the interaction intuitive for players (how to signal it can be pulled/activated).
        -   Ensuring the climbing process isn't tedious, leading to the idea of an automatically spinning/upwards moving plant.
        -   Technical implementation of the growth animation and visual fading.
-   **Collectible System:** Replacing the traditional 100-coin star with a system of collecting six Yoshi Coins, which can be gathered at any time during other missions without losing progress.
-   **Tooling Challenges:** Encountering and troubleshooting issues with Blender (snapping behavior, edge splitting, vertex manipulation) and emulators (RS emulator flickering and crashing).
-   **Technical Graphics Issues:** Dealing with drawing order for transparent objects and attempting different methods to achieve desired visual effects like "dimmer layers" or fading objects into fog.

## Business Aspects
-   The game is explicitly a non-commercial ROM hack ("I will send you 0.01% of the money the game makes off of sales, which is zero").
-   The planned demo release serves as a method for gathering crucial player feedback and building community engagement, rather than for sales.
-   Kaze's YouTube channel and video releases are the primary means of "marketing" (i.e., raising awareness and sharing progress) and are strategically timed with development milestones like the demo.

## Key Quotes
-   "the skybox is so much better than before, and it's now Yoshi's Island related, which is very very good." (On achieving thematic consistency and visual improvement)
-   "I want more data on gameplay. I want more feedback for how people think the physics work and how the camera works and stuff like that. So that when I release the full game, we know for sure people like the camera and the physics." (On the purpose of the upcoming demo)
-   "We should have this guy [flower bud enemy] in the game anyway. Because he's from Yoshi's Island. And we're returning to Yoshi's Island. We'll have him here. And then you just jump on the leaves." (On incorporating thematic elements and brainstorming new mechanics)

- **Major Milestones:**
    - Completion of platforming logic within the game's castle.
    - Ongoing integration and optimization of the F3DX3 microcode, showing substantial performance improvements.
    - A demo for "Return to Yoshi's Island" is planned for release after an upcoming video edit is finished.
- **Development Stages:** The game appears to be past the core mechanics implementation for some areas and is now in a phase of level detailing, visual enhancement, asset creation/improvement, and deep technical optimization. Kaze mentions skipping a week of streams but has made "a lot of progress" since.

## Personal Insights
- **Kaze's Standards and Iteration:** Kaze is self-critical and iterative. "This room now looks decent. It's still not good, but it no longer looks like complete ass." He shows satisfaction in specific details: "I kind of like this ice carpet here. I think it's a nice touch."
- **Design Philosophy:** He considers player experience and difficulty, aiming for fairness even in challenging sections: "I think the difficulty here is appropriate for CoS 13." and when explaining safety nets for falls, "So I think it's fair."
- **Pride in Work:** He expresses satisfaction with successful creative and technical implementations: "Doing this combined I took a bit, but you see how it just disappears into the clouds here? I like that a lot."
- **Opinions on Game Development:** Kaze has strong opinions on game design and technical practices, as seen in his critiques of Rare's N64 optimization ("I'm about to fail a fucking QuickTime event and go on a full rant about how terrible Banjo-Kazooie optimizes") and Conker's Bad Fur Day.
- **Modding History:** He mentions his early modding experiences: "Did I make my first Mario 64 remake with Blender? Nope, I used Google Sketchup. It was not a good time."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Design & Mechanics:**
    - Use of "pure white doors" to act as portals for room culling, optimizing rendering performance: "So by having a door like this, I can make it so that the room behind here doesn't render right now."
    - Implementing a "mirror... wallkick section. On the mirror. So it will look like you're punching wallkick mirror Mario."
    - Designing levels with intentional difficulty but also safety nets for players: "First of all, if you fall down here, you can still save yourself like this... There's a line of coins guiding you to safety."
    - Identifying need for asset improvement: "I also want a new grind animation here for Mario. The one we have right now is not it."
- **Technical Challenges & Solutions (Rendering, Performance):**
    - Managing render layers for transparency: "Layer 6 is transparent decals. Layer 5 was just transparent to invert the order. Because you have to render transparent stuff in Z order."
    - Extensive work on performance optimization through F3DX3 microcode with Soren, covering RSP/RDP bottlenecks, vertex buffer improvements, auto-batched rendering, and display list hints.
    - Debugging visual glitches like a stretched HP circle or corrupted text rendering with the new microcode.
    - Discussion on texture choices and their visual impact: "This texture here looks pretty poopy."

## Game Development Process
- Currently UV mapping and texturing Course 13, a large castle level. Platforming for this level is mostly complete.
- Successfully integrated FBDX3, a new microcode by Sauron, leading to significant performance improvements (around 50 FPS, aiming for stable 60 FPS).
- Identified that the RSP (Reality Signal Processor) is now the primary performance bottleneck, not memory traffic, especially with optimized games using FBDX3.
- Planning a demo for "Course 1" to showcase new camera and Mario controls.
- Actively working on optimizing draw distances and considering per-area draw distance.
- A separate Banjo-Kazooie project (porting levels into his engine) has 120 stars finished, demonstrating engine capabilities.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is often self-critical of his work-in-progress visuals, calling early textures "dog shit" or "hideous," but is focused on achieving a specific vision.
- His design philosophy for visuals is primarily about evoking emotions in the player (e.g., "cold and mysterious" for the current ice/castle level).
- He acknowledges when the art direction feels "boring" or is "missing the secret sauce" and iterates on it.
- Kaze expresses a desire to create more YouTube content to increase his income, especially with new family responsibilities, even if it means he might have to "sell out a little bit."
- He believes in learning programming fundamentals deeply, suggesting MIPS Assembly as a starting point before C.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mention of "Badub" by name in this transcript. Music selection was discussed with a choice of "Marker the SOST," which could potentially be Badub or another composer.
- Biobak: A graphics artist who Kaze relies on to significantly improve and finalize the visual aspects of levels. Kaze states, "Really at this point I have resigned myself to like knowing that whatever I do is just kind of like a suggestion for Biobank and he's gonna make it look a lot better."
- Zeina: Working on assets for the outside area of the current level. Kaze also mentions Zeyna will be cutting his hair.
- Other Contributors:
    - Sauron: Creator of the FBDX3 microcode, which has been crucial for performance improvements.
    - Marker: Mentioned as the composer for "Marker the SOST" (Super Ominous Synth Track, presumably) chosen for the stream.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Visuals & Atmosphere:** Striving for a "cold and mysterious" feel for the current ice-themed castle level (Course 13). Experimenting with textures and colors (e.g., blue, teal) to achieve this.
- **Performance Optimization:** Constant challenge. Migrating to FBDX3 improved FPS but revealed RSP as the new bottleneck. Techniques like "room doors" are used for culling to manage rendering loads.
- **Technical Bugs:** Encountered an issue with ambient light disappearing near additional light sources ("I couldn't figure it out at all"). Also, a temporary issue with running out of memory for collision triangles, to be solved with a collision map.
- **Level Structure:** Course 13 is designed as a large, labyrinthine castle with multiple paths and secret areas (e.g., a secret pipe leading to a Yoshi coin).
- **Player Experience:** Considering how to make level transitions (e.g., castle to cave) more visually obvious. Aware of diverse player feedback regarding difficulty.
- **Asset Creation:** Dealing with issues like stretched textures which will be automated later. Working on textures for walls, floors, and environmental elements.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze plans to increase his YouTube video output to generate more income due to personal financial needs (having a child).
- He is considering releasing a demo of "Course 1" to allow players to experience new mechanics.
- He humorously discusses YouTube trends and the idea of creating drama for views, indicating an awareness of platform dynamics for visibility, though he states he doesn't want to be a "drama YouTuber."

## Game Development Process
- The game is actively in development, with Kaze working on 3D modeling, level design, programming, and bug fixing.
- A significant technical upgrade involves the use of "FBDX3" (presumably Fast3D EXtension v3), which has improved RSP (Reality Signal Processor) performance, addressing previous bottlenecks.
- Kaze is creating custom systems, such as a per-level memory allocator for collision data and a refactored mirror system.
- Current focus includes fixing a persistent lighting bug where ambient light resets with multiple light sources, and resolving collision surface ("surf") limitations.
- Performance is a key concern, with a target of 60 FPS on N64 hardware, achieved through techniques like room culling.
- A phased release plan is in place: Version 1 for emulators and N64, Version 1.1 with bug fixes for both, and a subsequent version potentially dropping emulator-specific support to maximize N64 performance.
- A demo is planned, focusing on "Chris 1" (likely Course 1), but the lighting bug needs to be fixed before its release.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is driven by a passion for N64 development and a desire to push the hardware's capabilities.
- He expresses strong, pragmatic opinions on software development, e.g., "I think that if you care at all, like even just a little bit about which programming language you use, that is a very strong indicator that you're a terrible programmer."
- He acknowledges the challenges of balancing this extensive project with a full-time job and family responsibilities, stating, "Because I have a child now and I need more money. So hopefully there will be more streams, but I don't know how I'm going to manage the time wise since I do have a full-time job on top of being all of this."
- He is skeptical of emulator accuracy for N64 development: "I'm not gonna trust any emulator ever to actually be accurate to what N64 acts like... the N64 is fucked up."
- He shows resilience and humor in the face of challenges, including technical bugs and even an attempted spear-phishing scam.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No specific contributions mentioned in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Kaze prepares levels and models with Biobak's review in mind: "Really, it's just kind of getting these rooms to look a little nicer. So it's not insulting to Biobank when I pass this over."
    - Biobak appears to have high standards for visual quality and precision, with Kaze humorously mentioning "the wrath of Biobank" if things aren't visually correct.
- **Zeina (Animator):** Greeted as "Zena" at the beginning of the stream, but no specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Soren (Sauron):** A key collaborator working on FBDX3 and RSP microcode improvements. Kaze mentions waiting for Soren to finish his work on microcode and credits their joint effort in identifying the RSP as a performance bottleneck, which FBDX3 helped alleviate.
    - **WiseGuy:** Mentioned positively for his work on a static recompilation PC port of SM64, Kaze notes "WiseGuy knows what he's doing."
    - **Dario:** Mentioned in relation to the RT64 (N64 Ray Tracing) project; Kaze trusts Dario's word on when that project is considered "done."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Room-based Level Design for Performance:** Levels are structured in rooms with doors that occlude visibility, ensuring better performance and aiming for "guaranteed 60 FPS."
- **Lighting System Issues:** A major challenge is a bug where additional light sources cause ambient lighting to reset to zero. This is a priority fix, especially for the demo.
- **Collision Management:** The game faces issues with the N64's collision surface limits ("surf"). Kaze has implemented a custom memory allocator per level to address this, but it's an ongoing concern.
- **Mirror Implementation:** Kaze refactored the mirror system to be flag-based and more efficient/easier to use, describing it as "the easiest system to add new murals ever."
- **Visual Effects vs. Performance:** Kaze notes some visual effects, like a "focus" effect, are "completely free" performance-wise, indicating an effort to maximize visual appeal within N64 constraints.
- **Balancing Aesthetics and N64 Authenticity:** Decisions on ceiling design (e.g., fading to black) and texture work are made with the N64's rendering capabilities in mind.
- **Blender UV Mapping:** Kaze expresses frustration with UV mapping issues in newer Blender versions.

## Business Aspects
- **Distribution Method:** Due to legal constraints with Nintendo copyright, the game will be released as a patch. Kaze states, "I will release a patch that will contain only my own changes. And then you will be ableable to patch this patch onto an N64 ROM."
- **No Official Physical Release:** Kaze explicitly states, "No, I can't physically release this game, Christian. Because if I do, I will get giga sued by Nintendo." He is aware of unofficial sellers illegally distributing his games.
- **Monetization/Funding:** While not a direct business model for the game, Kaze mentions his personal need for more money (due to having a child) as a motivation for streaming more. Donations are a part of his streaming, though he notes an issue with donation alerts not working.
- **Advertising Scam Attempt:** Kaze recounts a sophisticated spear-phishing attempt from a fake advertiser, highlighting a non-developmental challenge faced by content creators.

## Key Quotes
- "Ever since x3 we have one little bug in the game... if a second light source appears like the star over there Morris colors just go dark the ambient just resets to zero." (Highlights a key technical challenge)
- "Basically, my plan is version 1 of Return to Yoshi's Island is going to work on emulator and N64... And then I will ditch emulator support entirely." (Outlines the release strategy and commitment to N64 hardware)

## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively working on his "major hack," "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Off-stream work included "basic uv-mapping" for various elements.
- A current project on stream is "getting the UVs for the walls to look half decent," followed by work on a "retro section."
- The game is structured with courses; Kaze mentions being "in course 13" and that "the Space Arcade and the Papercraft level are the last two" (though he then immediately starts planning a Super Mario Land 1 retro level, suggesting its placement might be flexible or for a different purpose like an "8-bit pipe").
- A significant technical task involved "swapping layer 5 and layer 6... permanently swapped the draw layers" across all levels, which required careful implementation.
- Debugging crashes is a frequent and time-consuming part of the process, with causes traced to collision triangles, specific actors, and coin formations.
- Development involves creating 3D models from 2D sprites, as seen with the Mario plane for the Super Mario Land 1 level.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze approaches his work with dedication, humorously stating, "I have officially lost my mind. I am actually working. On my major hack."
- He finds streaming to be an efficient way to work: "I'm gonna just stream like basically every day now. Because I'm very efficient working on stream."
- Personal nostalgia influences design choices, such as the inclusion of a Super Mario Land 1 level: "I haven't played Land 2 as a child. So for me, Land 1 is like the only one that I will have some nostalgia for."
- Kaze has a pragmatic approach to development tools, particularly emulators: "The thing is, every emulator is broken as fuck... I just have to pick one emulator and run with it." He chooses Project64 for its usability and his familiarity with its bugs.
- He expresses strong opinions on development practices and tools, for example, his decided preference against using the Parallel emulator.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.

    - **Strygon:** Kaze mentions, "I'm going to run Strygon to update the Upgrader UI to get it to update correctly," indicating Strygon developed or provided a tool Kaze uses for his development pipeline.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Key Design Choices:**
    - Inclusion of "retro sections" based on pre-Mario 64 games. Super Mario Land 1 is chosen for an "8-bit pipe."
    - The Super Mario Land 1 level will be black and white ("essential to the aesthetic") and feature forced-perspective, rail-shooter gameplay where Mario is in a plane.
    - Only games released before Mario 64 are eligible for these retro levels to maintain temporal consistency.
    - Decision to use fog in the SML1 level to manage draw distance and aesthetics.
    - Deliberate choice to fix the N64 graph render code to improve performance ("Make it all fit into one block of cache. And now the entire game runs at 30 FPS").
- **Obstacles Faced & Solutions:**
    - Frequent game crashes are a major challenge, requiring systematic debugging (e.g., isolating issues to coin formations, specific actors, or collision data).
    - Lost work due to unforeseen consequences of actions: "I just undid a lot of work" after realizing projecting UVs undid previous work on certain models.
    - Technical challenge of creating suitable assets for retro levels, such as making 2D front sprites for 3D enemies in the SML1 level, or creating a 3D model of Mario's plane from its original 2D sprite.
    - Deciding on the best way to implement vehicle sections from retro games to be engaging in 3D.
    - Managing N64 limitations, such as draw layers and optimizing for the RSP.
    - Ensuring compatibility with the chosen emulator (Project64 with Gliden) and deliberately not supporting others to save effort.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze mentions a potential promotional opportunity: "So it looks like there's a chance that I'm going to get a mystery box gifted from some weeb gift shop thing. And they want me to just give away some stuff."
- Streaming is linked to income, influencing his work schedule: "But also, I need to work more because I want to make more money. So that's why I'm gonna just stream like basically every day now."
- A joking comment about potentially "mining Bitcoin in the idle thread while you're playing the game" as a way for players to "give back."

## Key Quotes
- "I am actually working. On my major hack. What is going on?" (Captures his dedication and the intensity of the project).
- "So, we're thinking Mario Land 1 for the 8-bit pipe... Now we're definitely doing the whole thing in black and white. That's essential to the aesthetic." (Highlights a specific design decision and its rationale).
- "The thing is, every emulator is broken as fuck. It's just that I've been using this emulator because this one is the easiest one to use... If I wanted to support a second emulator, I would have to also work around all the bugs in that emulator. So for me, I just have to pick one emulator and run with it." (Explains his pragmatic approach to technical challenges).

## Potential Interview Topics

*Extracted on: 20240907*

## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively working on a specific level/section inspired by Mario Land, focusing on creating 3D assets for enemies (a bird-like creature, "chicken" from Mario Land 1) and implementing their behavior (shooting, death animations).
- He mentions, "After this I have two more stages, but course 14 is already like half way done," indicating progress tracking and a larger game structure.
- The process involves modeling, texturing, considering animations (wing movement, death sequence using animated textures), and integrating sound effects.
- He outlines next steps: "what we need next is just the enemy airplanes and their bullet bill and then we have all the assets done and we can make the level."
- Optimization is a concern, evidenced by comments on triangle counts ("This already has 19,000 triangles and it's like barely finished").
- Debugging graphics plugin issues (Gliden) and considering future plugins like RT64 is part of the workflow.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses feeling exhausted but continues to work: "I feel so exhausted today... I don't know why I'm so exhausted."
- He has strong opinions on game accessibility within the ROM hacking community: "This is something that rom hackers severely underrate and it's the barrier to entry... every step along the way... you lose some percentage of your player base... it is something i'm very worried of."
- He reflects on the nature of his project: "Well, would you want to just play a copy of Mario Land on Mario 64? What's the point in that? Right, it has to be different and I chose to make it different by having it be 3D."
- He voices concerns about potential Nintendo takedowns but accepts it as a risk: "of course there is a worry that nintendo is just going to say now fuck you your game is over but you just have to live with that."
- Kaze shares his personal stance on pirating games (dislikes it due to virus risks) and his preference for C++ over C ("C++ is basically the same as C just for some extra features. So it's really just a better C").

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific contributions or interactions detailed in this transcript segment.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No specific contributions or interactions detailed in this transcript segment.
- **Zeina (animations):** No specific contributions or interactions detailed in this transcript segment.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Leela (Viewer/Community Contributor):** Actively engages with Kaze in the chat, provides a 2D sprite of the bird enemy ("Alright, let's see this in your image... Alright, let's see if we can make changes to our bird based on this"), offers suggestions on game design, and discusses various topics with Kaze.
    - **Onionkit (Viewer/Community Contributor):** Kaze requests a Bullet Bill front view sprite from them: "onionkit if you want you can send them to me on discord like in my discord that would be perfect".
    - **Wiseguy (Developer):** Kaze mentions consulting him about RT64: "You know what, I'll ask Wiseguy himself right now. Is RT64 out already?"
    - **Falco Buster:** Mentioned for a "PNG fixer" tool Kaze uses.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Translating 2D to 3D:** A core challenge is adapting 2D gameplay concepts (from Mario Land) into a 3D space. This includes camera perspective ("How are you going to aim like that? And how are you going to know where the play area ends... Those are two big issues with that idea.") and enemy design.
- **Camera System:** Kaze is hesitant about significantly changing the camera angle for the on-rails shooter section due to aiming and play area visibility concerns. He notes, "I have tried having the camera follow Mario at the beginning and it did not look good at all. It was way too much movement."
- **Enemy Design and Behavior:** Kaze works on the bird enemy's model, aiming for a "somewhat low poly" look that translates the original sprite. He implements its shooting ability and a death animation using animated textures ("what if we just have it be an animated texture... it just switches between those 8 frames").
- **Technical Limitations:** N64 hardware constraints (e.g., polygon count: "This already has 19,000 triangles") and graphics plugin issues (Gliden's point filtering, potential asymmetry) influence design and visual output.
- **Player Experience:** Kaze prioritizes a unique experience over a direct port: "it has to be different and I chose to make it different by having it be 3D." He also considers how players will perceive depth and interact with elements.
- **Sound Design:** Kaze experiments with different sound effects for actions like enemy shots, settling on a "Hounding cannon" sound.
- **Asset Re-use/Modification:** When Leela provides a sprite, Kaze considers how to incorporate its elements (like the head and eyes) into his existing 3D model rather than completely redoing it.

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube Strategy:** Kaze emphasizes the importance of consistent thumbnail design for his YouTube videos to increase viewer engagement: "It's important on YouTube that your thumbnails have a somewhat consistent style, because it makes people more likely to flick them." He specifies his desired style using "the random Mario from back then."
- **Demo Release:** He plans to release a demo of the game: "I'm gonna release a new demo at some point in the near future... it's just going to be the first course."
- **Asset Sharing:** Kaze intends to make the game's assets publicly available: "I'll definitely publish everything including assets... yeah I would release the blend files as well."

    - **Michi:** Kaze mentions wanting to ask ChatGPT why "Michi's code didn't work," implying a past technical contribution or issue.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Course 14 (Craft Level) Theme:** The level is designed with a "craft materials" aesthetic, featuring elements like crayons, paper cutouts, cardboard, plastic cups, and doodles. This theme is distinct from "Yoshi's Crafted World" but shares a similar vibe.
    - **Star Ideas for Course 14:**
        1.  Helping a Yoshi doodle protect apples from "squirrels" (squid-like craft creatures).
        2.  Reaching a Toad doodle on a mountain.
        3.  Bringing a yellow crayon to a Luigi doodle to draw a star on a piece of paper.
        4.  A platforming section inside a large cardboard box.
        5.  A weasel ball toy guarding a red coin area, leading to an 8-bit pipe to Mario Paint.
- **Asset Creation & Aesthetics:** Significant time is spent conceptualizing and creating assets like plastic cups (with reflective properties), cardboard trees, painted cardboard mountains, and push-pins for platforming. There's a focus on making these assets fit the craft theme and look good within N64 limitations.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Interactive drawing for a star (Luigi crayon star).
    - Potential for platforming on push-pins.
    - Idea for a paper airplane Mario can ride.
    - Tilting platforms made of cardboard and toothpicks.
    - Googly eyes with physics for fortress enemies like Thwomps.
- **Challenges & Solutions:**
    - **Clarity of Mechanics:** For the crayon-drawing star, Kaze plans to add a "trace outline" to make the objective clearer.
    - **Performance vs. Visuals:** Balancing the density of elements (e.g., clouds) to maintain FPS on N64.
    - **Asset Design:** Finding the right textures and modeling techniques to achieve the desired "craft" look (e.g., for plastic cups, paper lanterns).
    - **Theme Consistency:** Deciding against including books in the craft level as they "don't really feel like craft material," unless purely for "funny titles."
    - **NPCs in Craft Level:** NPCs in Course 14 will be "very robotic" and "not real people," making a complex story for the course difficult.
- **Level Structure:** Kaze mentions making a basic version of a level first, then adding details. He also discusses ideas for an overworld based on "Yoshi's fruit islands."

## Business Aspects
- **Sponsorships:** Kaze is actively negotiating a sponsorship with Raid Shadow Legends. He has a specific, humorous, and somewhat subversive idea for the sponsored video content, aiming to provide minimal actual promotion for Raid while delivering extensive unrelated content (four hours of "every visible wall in Super Mario 64").
- **Monetization & PR:** He views his YouTube channel and content creation as a key source of income and a public relations tool for his game development work, including future original commercial games.
- **Future Commercial Game:** Kaze states he wouldn't make an N64 game from scratch for financial success, suggesting a Steam release would be more viable, with a potential N64 version serving as an "advertisement."
- **Approach to Ads:** He generally dislikes ads and sponsorships, only taking them if he can control the narrative, subvert expectations, or if he genuinely believes in the product's merit.

## Key Quotes
- "This is the craft level. It's made out of craft materials, the whole thing. I still need a funny crayon brand name. I was thinking Craytendo would be good." (Describing Course 14's theme and early design thoughts)
- "One star I have planned is that there will be a piece of paper on the floor and there will be ice drawn on it. And there will be a doodle of Luigi standing next to the piece of paper. And he will be like, man, if only I had a yellow crayon, I could draw a star... So you bring him a yellow crayon... you draw a star on the paper and you get a star for it." (Detailing an innovative star concept)
- "Generally, I never take sponsorships unless I can think of a way to like fuck them over... So typically I do not take any sponsorships unless it's like, you know, something I actually think has some merit to it." (On his philosophy regarding sponsorships)
- "when i made last impact really my thought was never can i make this fun it was always just i have an idea i'll put it in... my mindset was so much like i don't want to be some lazy dude who doesn't put the things he wanted this game in" (Reflecting on his past development approach)

This might be a 1 million view banger.") and plans future video content with audience engagement and algorithm appeal in mind ("I think the algorithm on YouTube likes a lot if you have like 30 minute videos").
- **Outsourcing:** Hired a video editor to help with YouTube production, indicating a business decision to scale or manage workload.
- **Marketing/Release (Indirect):** The demo featuring Biobank's Course 1 remake suggests a step towards showcasing the game. Discussion of re-releasing "Missing Link" also touches on distribution.

## Key Quotes
- "For me, YouTube at this point. This the job part and like making the game is the fun part." (Reveals motivation and passion)
- "The one reason I want to maybe not make this course be on a giant table is that if I do that, it looks like you can go to the bottom. And I want there to be a death floor. So maybe we need to innovate a different way to make a death floor look." (Highlights a specific design challenge and iterative thinking)
- "Oh yes, we're only at quest 14 out of 15. But of course there's some side levels missing, the overworld and the bowser level. But quest 15 is also already halfway done because I already programmed all the assets for it, for the slide deck I made with Eiza." (Provides a clear status update on game progress)

- **Level Layout & Pathing:** A major focus is on designing non-linear levels with multiple paths. Kaze actively draws and re-evaluates paths to ensure varied gameplay options. For example, "This is very similar to the layout in peaches fury and that one was really not linear."
- **Filling Empty Space:** A recurring challenge is making large, flat cardboard areas engaging and visually interesting without breaking the theme or exceeding technical limits. "We're gonna have a problem that a lot of this is really big and empty and I'm not really sure how to make this less Flat and boring."
- **Asset Design & Detail:** Decisions are made about the specific construction of craft items, like whether a stapler needle is "too rough" for a paper mushroom or how to represent a flower cut-out simply.
- **N64 Performance Constraints:** Polygon counts, overdraw (RDP budget), and RSP performance are constant considerations that influence how detailed objects can be and how densely areas can be populated. "So we used around half of our polygon budget for the level. And we use more than half, more than our entire RDP budget, but the RDP budget is easy to fix."
- **Player Experience:** Consideration is given to jump difficulty and overall player challenge, aiming for fun but sometimes "evil" platforming sections.

## Business Aspects

## Game Development Process
- The game, "Return to Yoshi's Island," is actively in development, with a planned scope of 15 courses.
- Development involves creating specific assets and materials for levels, such as the styrofoam texture for a mountain in one of the courses.
- Optimization is a key consideration, with Kaze mentioning a previous code change that saved "like 30 instructions." He also notes that creating the styrofoam material with fewer polygons would be beneficial.
- The process is highly iterative, especially when tackling complex visual effects. Kaze experiments with numerous techniques and tools (including Blender, manual drawing, and analyzing existing textures) to achieve the desired outcome for the styrofoam material.
- There's a forward-looking aspect, as creating new materials like styrofoam is seen as adding "another interesting material to after this course."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong preference for focusing solely on game development during his streams: "I really don't want to talk about things. I want to just talk about making my game. That's all I want."
- He finds engaging in unrelated social interactions or answering off-topic questions "exhausting" when he wants to work.
- He voices frustration with the steep learning curve of new technologies or software: "Learning new tech is always so goddamn annoying."
- Despite challenges, he is driven by his vision and imagination for how game elements should look and feel: "By my imagination, it would be good. But maybe something appears that I can't think about yet."
- He shows perseverance through difficult tasks, even when feeling overwhelmed: "We're gonna spend the entire stream working on Styrofoam, aren't we?" followed by continued efforts.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub (composer): No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Biobak (graphics artist): No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Zeina (animations): No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Other Contributors (primarily from the streaming chat community):
    - **Lila:** Actively provides suggestions, textures (e.g., a displacement map), and technical guidance, particularly with Blender. Kaze mentions, "By the way Leela Your idea worked I applied your idea in the entire game it saved like 30 instructions or so."
    - **x-links:** Is "cooking" or working on creating a styrofoam texture for Kaze. Kaze later receives and evaluates a texture from him.
    - **Danik:** Provides a Blender file/setup for creating textures using Voronoi noise, which Kaze explores. Later sends an "improved styrofoam" texture and a normal map.
    - **Perch:** Suggested using a "sea sponge texture."
    - **Extanic:** Offers suggestions and attempts to help with Blender materials/shaders.
    - **Daryl:** Referenced as having previously implemented a similar N64 normal mapping technique that Kaze plans to adapt: "So this is something Daryl made first. I can't take credit for this."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Challenge: Creating a convincing styrofoam material with dynamic lighting on N64.** This is the central focus of the transcript. Kaze wants it to "look as close to real styrofoam as I can," with highlights that appear as the object/camera moves.
    - Initial attempts included looking for existing textures, trying to modify them, considering sea sponge or pebble textures, and even AI generation, none of which were satisfactory.
    - Kaze explored 3D modeling the texture in Blender, using displacement maps, and environment maps, encountering difficulties with tools and achieving the desired effect.
- **Challenge: N64 hardware limitations.**
    - Standard bump mapping is not feasible: "There was this article about bump mapping on n64, but it relies on being a specific way if I remember correctly." and "The N64 also can't do normal maps [natively]."
    - Overdraw is a concern: "Why skate that bump mapping but it has four times over draw and it only works on one normal song."
- **Solution/Decision: Implementing a fake bump mapping/dynamic lighting effect using normal maps and CPU pre-computation.**
    - The plan involves using a base texture and a separate highlight texture (or deriving highlights from a normal map).
    - The highlights' visibility will be controlled by vertex alpha, calculated based on the angle between the surface, the light source, and the camera.
    - To make this feasible for various surface orientations, Kaze decides: "What if the styrofoam was only allowed to be at like four or five different rotations... I'm thinking we're going to limit ourselves to six rotations. Or maybe eight." This involves pre-calculating or having multiple versions of the normal map for different orientations.
    - "We have to compute the output of the normal map before we pass this to the renderer on the CPU, which fortunately is cheap, which is why we used 16 directions [in the palette for grayscale values]."
- **Challenge: Texture tiling and appearance.** Kaze notes issues like "how obviously this texture repeats" and textures having "lighting baked in" when he needs a neutral base.

## Business Aspects
- Brief mentions suggest a budget-conscious approach to development, preferring to create assets or use free resources over paid ones.
    - When looking at a texture website: "All these cost money."
    - When a texture is "premium only": "Yeah, I'm not buying a plan."
- No other information on marketing, funding, or release plans was found.

## Key Quotes
- "I Want a styrofoam texture here... I need to find a way to make this look good." (Illustrates the core creative challenge of the stream).
- "The N64 also can't do normal maps. We have to compute the output of the normal map before we pass this to the renderer on the CPU..." (Highlights the technical ingenuity required for N64 development).
- "I find it very exhausting to have to engage in social stuff when I just want to work." (Reveals Kaze's intense focus and work style).
- "We just need to get the texture. The worst part is, even once we have that, I'm still not 100% sure it will work. So all this work might be for nothing." (Shows the uncertainty and risk in experimental development).

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Philosophy of N64 "Demake" Development:** Explore Kaze's motivations for developing for a retro platform like the N64 via decompilation, the specific appeal of its limitations, and how he approaches translating modern game design ideas (or "Return to Yoshi's Island" concepts) to this hardware.

    -   A sandy dune area with pyramids, a tent, cactuses, a felt palm tree, and googly-eyed swamps is partially complete.
    -   The red coin section has been relocated to inside a pyramid.
    -   A paper plane star sequence is planned, involving a Yoshi doodle and a dynamic flight path.
    -   Kaze estimates that these developments "basically finishes like two halves of two stars."
-   **Future Work:**
    -   Two more stars are planned: one in a cave area with a hidden entrance, and another involving an 8-bit pipe.
    -   The "icy section" originally planned is being reconsidered and might become a "castle biome" or "volcano section." Kaze is actively brainstorming this area's theme and mechanics.
    -   Work on enemy implementation is pending ("enemies are planned, we just have to program them").
    -   The overworld is a critical future component: "the overall is the most important part It will tie everything together and the later we do it the more information we have about the rest of the game."
-   **Development Speed:** The craft material aesthetic allows for relatively fast course creation, with the main work shifting to shaders and detailing: "this course was really fast to do because it's made out of simple craft materials."

## Personal Insights
-   **Creative Vision:** Kaze has a strong vision for the game's craft aesthetic, wanting elements to look authentically like styrofoam, paper, felt, etc. ("I Wanted to look like a mountain made out of styrofoam"). He aims for a balance where materials are recognizable yet form cohesive game environments.
-   **Self-Reflection on Process:** Kaze humorously notes his tendency to focus on specific details like textures ("How come almost every stream I do just devolves into looking for textures? Is this just how I'm built?").
-   **Engagement and Passion:** He expresses genuine excitement when design elements come together well ("Oh my God, I love it. So cool," referring to the new mushroom design).
-   **Design Philosophy:** Kaze values dynamic elements and lighting that enhance the 3D feel and material properties, rather than static textures ("The whole point of this is to be able to have the lighting bounce of it dynamically so it fits what the camera would see"). He also prefers direct learning over structured tutorials ("I do not like the donut tutorial").
-   **Openness to Feedback:** He actively engages with chat suggestions, sometimes implementing them live (e.g., mushroom redesign discussions).

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:** (Likely "but it was" in a typo) Is "making most of the music" for the game.
-   **Biobak:** (Likely "biobank") Is "helping me rework some of my levels." He also seems to be the "Daryl" mentioned as having a previous idea Kaze implemented for the styrofoam texture ("Daryl had this idea a while back and this is just me using that trick").
-   **Zeina:** While Zeina is a known collaborator for animations (as per the prompt), her specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" animations are not detailed in this transcript. Kaze discusses his own process of animating a contributed Yoshi doodle.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Yuan:** Donated $50 during the stream. A community member (possibly Yuan, though not explicitly confirmed) also submitted a Yoshi doodle asset which Kaze plans to use and animate.
    -   **Chat Community (various users like Leela, Skyloft, etc.):** Actively provide feedback, suggestions for textures, enemy ideas, and design critiques which Kaze acknowledges and sometimes incorporates. For example, feedback on the mushrooms led to a redesign discussion.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Aesthetic Cohesion:** Maintaining a consistent and believable "craft world" look across diverse materials (styrofoam, paper, felt, crayons, cardboard) is a primary goal and ongoing challenge.
-   **Technical Limitations of N64:**
    -   **Normal Maps:** The N64 lacks native normal map support. Kaze implemented a custom solution where textures are computed on the CPU for each orientation to simulate dynamic lighting/reflections on surfaces like styrofoam. This is performance-intensive.
    -   **Rendering Costs:** Many detailed craft ideas (e.g., pipe cleaners, frills on umbrellas) are "very Expensive to render realistically" on the N64, forcing design compromises or simpler approaches.
    -   **Emulator Compatibility:** Using newer F3DX features could break emulator compatibility, which is a concern ("Emulators are holding us back like that").
-   **Level and Biome Design:**
    -   The "icy section" is proving difficult to conceptualize with craft materials ("Maybe ice just doesn't work"). Kaze is considering changing it to a castle biome or a paper mache volcano.
    -   Designing engaging platforming sequences (e.g., the rolling crayon, paper plane flight, falling cardboard bridges).
-   **Enemy Design:**
    -   Brainstorming enemies that fit the craft aesthetic (e.g., scissors, cardboard Thwomps/Bombs/Whomps, whiteboard eraser, cardboard saw blades).
    -   Avoiding designs that might be too similar to other games like "Paper Mario the Origami King."
-   **Lighting and Textures:**
    -   Significant effort is put into making lighting and textures convey the properties of materials (e.g., styrofoam's reflectivity, felt's dullness).
    -   Kaze frequently searches for and edits textures to fit the aesthetic and technical constraints.
-   **Player Experience:** Ensuring quests are clear (e.g., Luigi's crayon) and platforming challenges are fair but engaging.

## Business Aspects
-   **Funding:** The project appears to be supported by community funding through:
    -   Direct donations during streams (e.g., Yuan's $50 donation via Streamlabs).
    -   Patreon ("Or you can tip me on Patreon if you want as well but that's like a monthly thing").
-   **Marketing/Distribution:** No specific marketing strategies or release/distribution plans are discussed in this transcript, though the stream itself serves as a form of community engagement and progress showcase.

## Key Quotes
-   "The N64 does not have normal map support. I added the support. The texture is computed on the CPU. And then the GPU just has surrendered. But that means I need to generate one texture for each orientation." (Highlights technical innovation and challenges)
-   "This course was really fast to do because it's made out of simple craft materials So really all I need to do is really just to shade us and stuff At least that's how I feel about it." (Explains a core design choice and its development impact)
-   "I think I'm changing this to a castle biome. And then snow area is gone. Lava area is also not really a thing anymore." (Illustrates the iterative nature of design and willingness to make major changes)
-   "Daryl had this idea a while back and this is just me using that trick... So we could absolutely like Do something like this? Yes And it would make this look a lot rounder. But oh my god, that's gonna be so much work to do." (Shows collaboration and the trade-offs between visual improvement and workload)

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is actively in development, utilizing the Mario 64 decompilation.
- A significant portion of the stream focuses on a new "paper" or "craft" themed level, which Kaze states is in a "very early version," having been started about "a week or two ago."
- Current work involves level design (adjusting areas like the starting zone and castle, placing props), mechanic refinement (specifically the spin jump), asset creation (e.g., the Thimble Shy Guy), and planning for collectibles (Yoshi Coins).
- Kaze is shown iterating on level geometry, platforming elements, and NPC interactions within this craft-themed level.
- Performance on N64 hardware is a consideration, with Kaze noting polygon counts and testing builds on actual hardware.
- The development includes bug fixing (e.g., breakdance animation bug, pause/unpause bug).
- There's a plan for "15 main courses" for the overall game.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a desire for "less random and more purposeful" design in level layouts.
- He is self-critical of game mechanics, noting the spin jump was initially "way too strong" and "broken."
- Kaze values a specific "craft" aesthetic for the current level, pondering how to represent elements like water and enemies using paper or cardboard.
- He acknowledges community feedback, sometimes with surprise, as when noting positive reactions to the paper level after previous negative comments.
- Kaze has a clear rule against incorporating elements from Mario games released significantly after the N64 era, unless they are original creations for the hack. ("Um, no, we're not referencing anything Nintendo made up for like 1996 or after 2001, whenever the last N64 game released.")
- He shows dedication to solving design problems, spending considerable time on stream working through issues like the Thimble Shy Guy's appearance or the spin jump mechanics.
- Kaze mentions, "I have also taken notes that I think we have our first real hater... There's one person disliking every video I upload like two minutes after I upload it. So this is exciting."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** Composer for the game. Kaze mentions, "Ideally I'm gonna have a music that changes depending on which biome of the level you're in... I'm gonna see what music Badoob is gonna come up."
- **Biobak:** Graphics artist. Kaze mentions Biobak swapped out some newer enemy pictures ("I'm pretty sure Biobank swapped those out") to align with the game's intended N64-era style. Also mentioned, "Biobank is almost done, I think," suggesting ongoing work.
- **Zeina:** Animator/Artist. Mentioned in relation to cloud assets: "Zeyna wants to draw in clouds anyway, so I'm attaching them right now." Also, when discussing the Shy Guy model: "Is it because 13? Zena is working on it right now. It's not finished." (It's unclear if "13" refers to a version or something else, or if "Zena" is the same as "Zeyna").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Layra:** A community member who provided a 3D model/suggestion for the Thimble Shy Guy and a cloud model that Kaze considered and decided to use. ("Let's see what this is, Layra... That cloud does look really nice... I think I'm going to switch over to these then.")
    - **Michi:** Kaze briefly mentions checking "Michi's art on here."
    - **Chat Members (general):** Kaze actively interacts with chat, taking suggestions and feedback. One user provided a cloud ".plant" file which Kaze adopted.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Spin Jump Mechanics:** A major focus was to make the spin jump "less oppressive" and not "way too broken." Kaze iterated on its height, control, and feel, aiming for something like Smash Bros. Down B, ultimately reducing its height gain but improving its air stall capabilities.
- **Yoshi Coin Placement:** Kaze wants to make Yoshi Coins engaging and "not boring," exploring ideas like trampolines, secret entrances (cardboard flaps), and interactions with NPCs/environments. He is keen to avoid placing them too obviously or in ways that don't feel rewarding.
- **Craft Aesthetic Implementation:** A recurring challenge is translating game elements into a convincing "craft" style. This includes:
    - **"Paper Water":** Discussed various ideas like tinsel or cellophane, acknowledging the difficulty of making it interactive.
    - **Enemy Design:** Rejected a "scissor enemy" as it's a tool, not a craft. Brainstormed ideas like "dust bunnies" and spent significant time designing a "Thimble Shy Guy," focusing on its material (metal, felt, cardboard, cup), shape, and texture to make it recognizable and thematic.
    - **Props:** Styrofoam, waxed cardboard, "penis hills," and cardboard cutout clouds are part of this aesthetic.
- **NPC Interactions:** Planning for NPCs made of paper/craft materials, such as a "Paper Peach" rescue mission involving Shy Guys, and interactions with existing "doodles" of Toad and Luigi.
- **Level Layout & Flow:** Kaze adjusted the starting area to be "more purposeful" and considered adding elements like a slide through a mountain. He also addressed performance concerns related to object density in central areas.
- **Technical Visuals:** Extensive discussion on achieving specific lighting effects (specular highlights, normal maps vs. bump maps) on N64 to enhance the craft material look. Kaze mentions developing a custom solution for reflections.
- **Movement System:** Beyond the spin jump, Kaze mentions that "Return to Yoshi's Island" features an enhanced M64 moveset with bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements (e.g., jumping after a long jump, consistent wall kick speed).

## Business Aspects
- **Release Model:** "Yes, it will release for free. I never charge for my games. I wouldn't be allowed to."
- **Source Code:** "Yes, the source will be public."
- **Hypothetical Monetization:** If allowed, Kaze mused, "Probably release the base game for free and then you could buy a skin or something."
- **Community Engagement:** The stream itself, interaction with chat, and calls to action ("Don't forget to like and subscribe!") serve as community building and informal marketing. Donations from viewers (e.g., "Saburo buy 1,500 bits") are acknowledged.

## Key Quotes
- "Another thing I really wanna work on today is figuring out a way to make the spin jump less oppressive on the whole game's design as a whole. I think the spin jump is cool, but it's way too strong." (Highlights a key design challenge and iterative process)
- "What I am thinking about, though, is more ways to put Yoshi coins in here that are not boring." (Shows concern for player experience and engaging collectibles)
- "Basically, the Yoshi coins are special interactions that we have in each level... this level doesn't have many NPCs that we can program interactions with. So we need to be creative and come up with things." (Defines the role of Yoshi Coins and the creative challenge)
- "Um, no, we're not referencing anything Nintendo made up for like 1996 or after 2001, whenever the last N64 game released." (States a core design philosophy regarding source material)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Exploring Kaze's overarching goals for the hack, how the "paper level" fits into it, and the desired player experience.
- **Crafting the Aesthetic:** Delving into the inspiration and challenges of realizing the unique paper/cardboard art style on N64 hardware, including the technical solutions developed.
- **Collaborative Dynamics:** Understanding how Kaze works with his team (Badub, Biobak, Zeina, and community contributors like Layra), how creative ideas are exchanged, and tasks are managed.
- **Iterative Design in Practice:** Discussing the process of refining core mechanics like the spin jump, and how community feedback influences development decisions.
- **Philosophy of ROM Hacking:** Kaze's perspective on pushing the N64's limits, his approach to originality within a pre-existing framework, and his decision to keep his work free and open source.

## Game Development Process
- The game, "Return to Yoshi's Island," is in a late stage of development, with Kaze working on the 14th of 15 planned main courses (out of approximately 30 total levels).
- Recent focus includes developing new enemy types (Thimble Guys, Bert the Bashful) for these later courses, including their AI, animations, and unique mechanics.
- A significant graphical rework of Course 1 (an earlier level) by collaborator Biomech is being reviewed and integrated.
- An upcoming major milestone is the release of a game demo, for which Kaze is preparing promotional material (Patreon post).
- The game will feature approximately 135 main stars and 45 "Yoshi Stars," which are special missions with unique restrictions (e.g., A-press limits).
- Kaze is also planning future YouTube content, including a re-release of "The Missing Link" with updates.

## Personal Insights
- **Kaze's vision for the overworld:** He emphasizes the importance of the overworld encompassing the entirety of Yoshi's Island, offering a 360° view and encouraging exploration of every "nook or cranny."
    - *"I was thinking for the overworld. It is super important that the overworld is the entirety of Yoshi's Island. It is important that you get like a 360° round view of the beach next to Yoshi's Island. So it feels like you can actually explore the entire island."*
- **Critique of Badoob's music for a level:** While appreciative of the effort, Kaze feels a submitted track doesn't quite fit the "adventure" vibe of the level and lacks a hummable melody.
    - *"For me It doesn't fit the vibe. Feels more like A beach at sunset. Not like a complete adventure, you know. And I'm also kinda missing the The melody that you can hum along to."*
- **Pragmatism on naming:** Kaze admits he doesn't personally care much about names for things but acknowledges their importance for public communication and avoiding confusion.
    - *"Truth be told, i'm not someone who cares about names for things i know what it does and it's good enough for me but i will need a name to tell people on what it is..."*
- **On Large Language Models (LLMs):** Kaze expresses skepticism about the current utility of LLMs beyond being a "better Google."
    - *"I have talked to a company that makes a thing to gather data for AI... And since I talked to them, I have just gotten 100% sure that all large language models are just garbage."*

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):**
    - Created a song for the current level Kaze is working on. Kaze solicits feedback from the stream chat and offers his own critique regarding its thematic fit.
    - *"This is the song that Badoob made for this level..."*
- **Biomech/Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Responsible for a significant graphical rework of Course 1, including visual enhancements and optimizations (reducing tris and materials).
    - Kaze reviews Biomech's work in detail, discusses integrating it, and notes the need to sometimes fix texture formats from Biomech's files.
    - *"Let's check out Biobank's rework... Quick facts, 220 fewer tries, 7 fewer materials, that is insane."*
    - *"Oh yeah, Biomech, can you send me a cool screenshot of the level? I wanna make a Patreon post about the demo releasing soon."*
- **Xena (Mentioned as Zeina in prompt):**
    - The transcript only mentions Kaze playing Minecraft with "Xena." No direct contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this specific transcript.
    - *"I have started playing Minecraft for the first time recently with Xena."*
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Retro:** Mentioned as a collaborator whose work or task completion is awaited before Kaze can import certain things related to Biomech's rework.
        - *"Thoughts on checking out the rework today and importing it later when retro is done."*

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Thimble Guy Mechanics & Aesthetics:**
    - **Challenge:** Designing their defeat. Squishing them would contradict their hard, thimble-like nature.
        - *"The thing is, if we make them squish, it wouldn't look like a thimble anymore. Because a thimble is hard material."*
    - **Solution:** Making them behave like "Bullies" from Mario 64, where Mario must knock them off platforms.
        - *"I was thinking they should work more like bully fights where you kick them off the thing."*
    - **Challenge:** Implementing a dynamic light reflection (shine) on their thimble hats, which involved significant debugging due to a compiler-related variable shadowing issue.
        - *"And I need to make it so that the light reflection on the hat properly moves when you turn the camera."* (Followed by extensive debugging)
- **Bert the Bashful (Painted Egg Enemy) Design:**
    - **Goal:** Create an enemy that looks "handcrafted" and like a "painted egg." Initial designs felt a bit "cheap."
        - *"I like him, but he doesn't look very handcrafted. Yeah, I like him to look like a painted egg. But the sharp cutout here is kind of ruining that."*
    - **Behavior:** Designed to jump aggressively and bounce Mario back upon contact, making them dangerous near pits or death floors, aligning with their behavior in Yoshi's Island.
        - *"And when he touches you, he doesn't deal damage. He bounces you back... And because there's so much depth floor here, that makes them really, really dangerous."*
- **Level Naming:**
    - **Challenge:** Finding a suitable name for the current crafty-themed level.
    - **Suggestions/Considerations:** "Handmade Heights" and "Paper Craft Peaks" were liked by Kaze. He considers alliteration and rhyme.
        - *"Handmade heights and paper craft peaks. Those were the two I liked."*
- **Overworld Concept:**
    - **Design Choice:** The overworld should be the entirety of Yoshi's Island, explorable in 360 degrees, with progression unlocking deeper areas of the island.

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing and Promotion:**
    - Kaze plans to create a Patreon post to announce the upcoming demo release.
        - *"I wanna make a Patreon post about the demo releasing soon."*
    - He considers making more "Mario 64 facts" videos for his YouTube channel to gain broader viewership.
        - *"I was thinking of making more like Mario 64 facts videos if the BLJ one does well... I think that's the kind of slop that YouTube viewers love and I think we can get famous that way."*
- **Release and Distribution:**
    - A demo of "Return to Yoshi's Island" is planned to be released soon.
    - Kaze entertains the idea of releasing the game's Original Soundtrack (OST) on a physical cartridge, potentially as merchandise.
        - *"I was actually thinking of just releasing R.T.Y.I. Together with an OST cartridge... Because then we could sell it too As merch."*
- **Legal Considerations:**
    - Kaze is aware of Nintendo's stance on fan projects (mentioning his "Missing Link" video being taken down) and plans to consult a lawyer before releasing "Return to Yoshi's Island."
        - *"But I will probably talk to a lawyer Before I release R.T.Y.I."*

## Key Quotes
- *"It's going to be like 30 levels in total, but 15 main courses and we're on the 14th."* (Provides a clear indication of project scope and progress).
- *"I was thinking for the overworld. It is super important that the overworld is the entirety of Yoshi's Island... So it feels like you can actually explore the entire island."* (Highlights a key design ambition for the game).
- *"And this is why you don't trust your fucking compiler. You look at the assembly and then you find it out. Fuck you, GCC."* (Illustrates a moment of intense debugging and a developer's frustration/triumph).
- *"But I will probably talk to a lawyer Before I release R.T.Y.I."* (Shows awareness of the potential legal landscape for fan projects).

## Potential Interview Topics
1.  **The Grand Vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Explore Kaze's overarching goals for the project, what he hopes players will experience, and how the "Yoshi's Island" theme is being translated into a Mario 64 framework, particularly concerning the ambitious overworld design.
2.  **Creative Collaboration and Direction:** Discuss the dynamics of working with collaborators like Biomech and Badub. How does Kaze provide direction, integrate their work, and handle creative differences (e.g., the feedback on Badoob's music)?
3.  **Navigating Technical and Design Hurdles:** Delve into some of the most significant challenges faced during development (like the Thimble Guy shine bug or enemy AI) and the problem-solving process involved in overcoming them within the constraints of the N64 and the decompilation project.
4.  **The Future of the Project and Fan Games:** Ask about the plans for the demo, the potential full release, ideas like the OST cartridge, and Kaze's perspective on creating ambitious fan works in the current climate, including his approach to Nintendo's IP.

## Game Development Process
-   The stream focuses on the development of a Thwomp enemy, including modeling, texturing (papercraft/cardboard aesthetic), and behavior (googly eyes).
-   Significant progress is being made on "Course 1," with Kaze integrating a major rework provided by collaborator Biobak. This includes debugging rendering issues, lighting, and material properties.
-   Kaze mentions that "every level will get a Biobank rework."
-   A "Course 1 demo" is planned, which is a reason for the focused effort on this particular course.
-   The game is planned to have 15 courses. Course 14 is in progress, and Course 15 ("Halloween of Ardor") is about halfway complete.
-   Off-stream work includes the creation of a "soul enemy" and a "Z button hit" feature (likely a combat mechanic).
-   "Thimble guys" (another enemy type) are considered complete.
-   The game is being built using the Mario 64 decompilation and is intended to run on actual N64 hardware.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze has a clear artistic vision, particularly for the Thwomp's papercraft aesthetic: "I want this to look like a swamp. It's very important to me."
-   He is open to iteration and remaking assets if they don't meet his standards: "yeah actually fuck this let's remake this" (referring to the Thwomp model).
-   Kaze engages with his audience for suggestions (e.g., level names, Thwomp design) but ultimately makes the final creative decisions: "the names are good enough but i don't exclude the possibility that there's an even better one... i would never just be like yep we found the perfect thing."
-   He reflects on the game's narrative, mentioning an earlier, darker plot idea that was revised: "First, the plot was Bowser goes to Yoshi's Island and captures all the Yoshis and makes them work for him. But a whole slavery plot is maybe a bit too much for a Mario game. We definitely still have to do something like that, something Bowser threatens the Yoshis."
-   He expresses opinions on technical aspects, such as being skeptical of Level of Detail (LODs): "I'm not really a believer in lots. I think lots are very overrated."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (Composer):** The game's soundtrack is referred to as "Paper Gem OST." Kaze asks for "any ost wishes today," and a viewer suggests "paper gem ost," indicating Badub's musical contributions are integral and recognized.
-   **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** Biobak is a key collaborator responsible for significant graphical reworks of levels, most notably "Course 1" during this stream. He provides Kaze with updated level files, and Kaze spends considerable time integrating these changes, troubleshooting technical issues (lighting, Z-Buffer, shaders, render order), and discussing Biobak's design choices. Biobak also created the base model for the Thwomp Kaze is working on.
-   **Xena (Animator/Asset Creator):** Mentioned as a potential contributor for a specific asset: "Xena says the farm will offer her to make a red banner. I can let her know." This suggests Xena contributes art assets for the game.
-   **Other Contributors:** Viewers in the live chat actively provide suggestions for level names ("paper craft peaks or handmade heights"), Thwomp design ideas (e.g., "duct tape eyebrows," "visible glue"), and general feedback, which Kaze acknowledges and sometimes considers.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Thwomp Enemy Design:**
    -   **Aesthetic:** A major focus is on making the Thwomp fit a "papercraft" or "handmade" theme, experimenting with looks like construction paper, paper box, origami, and cardboard. Decisions involve texture, shininess, visible folds, and materials like duct tape for eyebrows.
    -   **Features:** Implementing dynamic "googly eyes" that can move independently and react to attacks. Designing an "angry" facial expression.
    -   **Sound Design:** Considering a "rattling sound when he hits the floor" and potentially snow-like impact sounds.
-   **Level Design & Reworks (especially Course 1):**
    -   **Iterative Process:** Course 1 is undergoing extensive reworks by Biobak, requiring Kaze to integrate, debug, and refine. The stated goal is to create another "Course 1 demo."
    -   **Technical Challenges:** Frequent issues with rendering (sky, clouds, transparency, Z-Buffer, render order), lighting adjustments, material properties ("This is the most fucked material ever"), and ensuring compatibility and performance.
    -   **Specific Changes to Course 1 (based on Biobak's rework):** Repositioning lens flare, adding more room around a treehouse, carrot-filled caves, relocating graffiti, changing castle color to red, adding new railings and roofs, improving lighting, and introducing new tree textures. A "retro area" within Course 1 is being designed with flat shading and camera-based lighting.
-   **Narrative Revision:** The initial plot involving Bowser enslaving Yoshis was deemed "a bit too much for a Mario game." The story is being revised to be less severe but will still involve Bowser threatening the Yoshis.
-   **Overall Game Structure:** Levels are designed to be large, open Mario 64-style worlds. However, collecting "stars" (or their equivalent) will lead to "entrances to either like linear challenges or like puzzles or stuff like that," aiming for "more meat to the stars."
-   **Enemy Behavior:** The "soul enemy" is described as a "very strong enemy." Thwomps will have the ability to look around.
-   **Technical Foundation:** The game must run on N64 hardware. Kaze discusses polygon limits (e.g., Thwomp around 164 polygons, other enemies 60-300), Z-buffering, shader usage, and texture filtering.

## Business Aspects
-   **Return to Yoshi's Island:** No direct mentions of funding, marketing strategies, or a fixed release date for this specific project. When pressed by chat for a Christmas release, Kaze humorously deflects.
-   **Potential Commissioned Project:** Kaze mentions a separate game idea, "Daisy's Fury with Luigi" (inspired by Bowser's Fury), which someone on Twitter offered to pay him to make. Kaze states, "if he does. I will do it." This is distinct from "Return to Yoshi's Island."

## Key Quotes
-   "I want this to look like a swamp. It's very important to me." (Kaze, on the Thwomp's design, emphasizing his commitment to a specific aesthetic.)
-   "First, the plot was Bowser goes to Yoshi's Island and captures all the Yoshis and makes them work for him. But a whole slavery plot is maybe a bit too much for a Mario game." (Kaze, reflecting on the narrative development and tonal considerations.)
-   "Basically the way most levels work is that it's like open like a Mario 64 world. It's a lot bigger and then instead of finding stars you find entrances to either like linear challenges or like puzzles or stuff like that. So there's a lot more meat to the stars." (Kaze, explaining the core structural design of the game's levels.)
-   "We spent the most of your development time on course one. The most. How do you define what the most is here? Because it's not more than 50%. I can tell you that much. It's also not more than 10%. The development time spent on course one is probably like 7%." (Kaze, responding to a viewer about Course 1 development time, highlighting the iterative nature and detailed work involved, even if it's not the bulk of total time.)

## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus:** Reworking "Chris 1" (Course 1) in preparation for a demo release. This involves integrating graphical updates, fixing rendering issues, optimizing performance, and importing updated actors.
- **Development Stages Mentioned:**
    - Fixing level geometry and rendering for Area 1.
    - Importing actors (models, animations).
    - Creating/implementing actor behaviors.
    - Performance benchmarking and optimization.
    - Bug fixing related to new asset integration.
- **Overall Progress:** The game has progressed significantly, with Kaze mentioning "we are in course 14," though the stream focuses on Course 1. The ROM size is nearing 64MB, a soft limit Kaze considers for N64 authenticity.
- **Milestones:**
    - Completion of Biobank's rework for Chris 1.
    - Upcoming demo release (planned to be just one stage).
    - Implementation of new physics features (e.g., Mario's nose).

## Personal Insights
- **On N64 Authenticity:** "But if you go over 64 MB, are you really still making an N64 game? I mean, you could argue you're making an N64 game because it runs on N64. But at the same time, it's kind of lame, right? It's like you're going beyond what they were able to do at the time. It just feels like cheating to me."
- **Pride in Visual Quality:** "I think I'm pretty sure this already is the prettiest N64 game there is. I don't think you can really make an argument against that."
- **Motivation for Streaming & Development:** "You need to realize my streams is like minimum effort. Really I just stream because I want to stream and because I like having people be able to give me feedback on this." He also mentions modding makes some money via YouTube/Patreon but it's not his main job.
- **Sharing Knowledge:** Kaze considers making a YouTube series analyzing the courses in "Return to Yoshi's Island" to share his thought processes and potentially gain insights.
- **Perfectionism & Problem Solving:** Spends considerable time fine-tuning details, optimizing, and debugging, often thinking aloud through complex technical issues.

-   **Development Stages:** The project appears to be in a stage of implementing core gameplay mechanics for specific levels/bosses, integrating assets from collaborators, and extensive bug fixing and polishing. There's also consideration for upcoming promotional content (YouTube videos).

## Personal Insights
-   **On Game Development:** Kaze views game development as an arduous process requiring extreme perseverance: "I keep saying this but if you want to be successful making video games you need to be mentally unwell... you're just gonna have to keep doing it." He emphasizes that fun is not the primary driver when facing difficult tasks.
-   **On Public Perception:** He is conscious of how his audience perceives his work, wanting to be recognized as a game developer rather than just a content creator making videos about Mario 64. "It's also like that people don't understand that I'm making a game. They think I'm just making videos."
-   **On His Project's Nature:** Kaze is clear that he is "making my own game," not just an optimized version of vanilla Mario 64. This is a key message he wants to convey to his audience.
-   **On Feedback:** He claims to "purposefully attract negative comments just to get feedback. And then I will use that feedback to improve my work," suggesting a pragmatic approach to criticism.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (Composer):** No specific information found in this transcript regarding Badub's direct musical contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island." An OST request was made for "Missing Link OST" during the stream, but this wasn't explicitly linked to Badub or RTYI.
-   **Biobank (Graphics Artist/Designer):**
    -   Contributes significantly to design and assets. Provided the "Goomba King model."
    -   Influences gameplay mechanics: "Biobank wanted to make a few changes to it [Goomba fight]. And I'm up for it."
    -   Provides ideas for video titles and marketing: "Biobank had great ideas [for video titles]."
    -   Expected to provide assets like "boss doors."
-   **Zayna (Animator):**
    -   Responsible for character animations. Kaze refers to Zayna's intentions for animations: "I feel like this is not what Zayna wanted [Goomba King animation]."
    -   Kaze compiles lists of needed animations for Zayna: "I'm going to write Zayna the animations we need."
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Zell:** Working on "Missing Link version updates." Kaze states, "I'm just gonna pay him to do it," indicating Zell is a paid contractor for that related project.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Goomba Boss Fight Mechanics:**
    -   **Decision:** The fight involves the player luring the Goomba King to a specific spot and then aiming a boulder (pushed by other Goombas) at him. "You want the Goomba to pick a place. He just walks there. And then the boulder follows Mario. Not the other way around. So you have to aim the boulder at him."
    -   **Challenge:** Implementing the Goomba AI for positioning and boulder interaction, fixing bugs where Goombas get stuck or don't push the boulder correctly.
-   **Visual Enhancements vs. Performance:**
    -   **Decision/Experimentation:** Implemented mipmaps. Attempted a bloom effect.
    -   **Challenge:** The bloom effect is "really expensive," costing "7 milliseconds of RDP time," making it potentially unusable in main game areas but perhaps feasible in smaller, optimized sub-areas.
-   **Animation Implementation:**
    -   **Challenge:** Numerous issues with the Goomba King's animations, including incorrect leg poses ("Why does he have only one leg up?"), sideways orientation, eyes not closing, and bubble effects not syncing. "I don't like how this doesn't sync to the animation. Looks very poopy."
-   **Bug Fixing (General):**
    -   **Challenge:** Persistent visual bugs (Spikey Goomba "just kind of disappears for a bit," Goomba King "teleports up"), game crashes (traced to "animation seven"), and collision issues.
-   **N64 Compatibility:**
    -   **Challenge:** Ensuring features work correctly on N64 hardware, including fixing N64-specific light bugs. "I fixed a lot of N64 bugs this past 2 days."

## Business Aspects
-   **YouTube Strategy & Marketing:**
    -   Kaze plans specific YouTube videos to reveal "Return to Yoshi's Island" and clarify its nature as a new game: "...a video just gonna be titled like so about that N64 game I've been working on... Where I tell people, hey, my channel I'm not actually trying to make the optimized vanilla Mario 64. I'm making my own game."
    -   Considers video titling crucial for viewership, taking suggestions from Biobank for more clickbaity/engaging titles like "The secret reason I've been rewriting Mario 64."
    -   Aims to avoid being categorized as "YouTube slop" while still attracting a large audience.
-   **Resource Management:**
    -   Kaze mentions paying Zell for work on "Missing Link version updates," showing a willingness to invest financially in development aspects, though this isn't directly stated for RTYI itself.

## Game Development Process
- Currently focused on bug fixing for an upcoming demo release.
- Course 1 is mostly complete and is planned to be the content for a second demo.
- The overall project involves multiple courses (e.g., Course 1, 13, 14, 15) which are in various stages of planning and completion.
- Kaze is actively working on integrating assets and features, such as a line of mushrooms from a collaborator and the Yoshi Coin radar.
- Milestones include testing the demo on N64 hardware.
- The game will feature seven stars per act, with the seventh being "find the egg coins."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes player experience, aiming to avoid frustrating mechanics and ensure features feel valuable and "cool." He states, "That's gonna be a miserable experience people are gonna hate that and I want to avoid that experience happening to anyone."
- He has a strong vision for the game's features, believing the coin system will "feel more valuable than Mario Odyssey."
- Kaze expresses frustration with software like Parallel Launcher due to frequent updates, but uses it for testing compatibility: "I only use parallel launcher to test if my game works on power launcher because I will never personally myself use power launcher."
- He is not interested in adding Rumble Pak support due to development overhead and not owning one himself.
- He shows a pragmatic approach to problem-solving, such as when identifying the B-Param issue causing objects not to spawn.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Biobak: No direct mention of Biobak by name in this transcript. (See "my bike" under Other Contributors).
- Zeina:
    - Present during the stream ("You You Zena in the house. She is in the house. Just chillin").
    - Kaze mentions wanting Zeina ("zainab") to pick up a second N64 console, suggesting she assists with tasks beyond a specific defined role. No specific animation contributions are discussed in this transcript.
- Other Contributors:
    - "my bike": Mentioned as working on assets. "There is a line of mushrooms that my bike is working on that I need to put in." This contributor is likely a graphics artist.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Yoshi Coin Radar:**
    - Initially considered as a buyable item, but changed to be automatically available during "Act 7: Find the Egg Coins" to prevent player frustration.
    - The radar functions similarly to Sonic Adventure 1's, blinking faster and changing color (e.g., to red) as the player gets closer to an egg coin.
    - Ongoing design considerations include the blinking effect being potentially distracting, the color of the radar icons vs. the in-level coin colors, and using transparency to indicate proximity or collection status.
- **Yoshi Coins & Economy:**
    - Coins are global and will be used for "overworld upgrades," such as donating to an NPC to build a bridge, allowing players to "affect the world by giving people money."
    - The goal is to make coins feel "very cool" and more valuable than in games like Mario Odyssey.
- **Level Design & Structure:**
    - Acts will have seven stars instead of the traditional six.
    - Course 13 is an "ice castle" (basically done).
    - Course 14 is a "craft world" (mostly done).
    - Course 15 is a "space arcade" (described as a "pathway," implying early stages).
- **Technical Challenges & Solutions:**
    - Fixing a bug where dynamic lights were not spawning in an area. Kaze discovered this was due to a Mario 64 engine feature where setting B-Param 3 to 255 prevents an object from spawning.
    - Addressing issues with texture resolution ("one pixel of texture is exactly one pixel of output on a nintendo 64 so if we grew or shrunk it that would look really bad").
    - Issues with lighting on Mario in a previous showcase video have since been fixed.

## Business Aspects
- **Demo Releases:**
    - Actively working on fixing bugs for a demo release.
    - A second demo is planned which will feature "only course one."
- **Community Interaction:**
    - Kaze interacts with his stream chat, acknowledging resubscriptions (e.g., "Thank you for the resub Davey").
- **Platform Awareness (Indirect):**
    - Briefly discusses a Nintendo strike issue concerning another creator (SM64 GOSSIP), indicating an awareness of potential platform-related risks for ROM hacking projects. Kaze believes the strike was from an "imposter."
- No direct mentions of funding or specific marketing strategies beyond demo releases were found in this transcript.

## Key Quotes
- "Imagine this situation imagine you have not bought the radar and you're doing a mission 7 and the game doesn't give you any hint at All that's gonna suck That's gonna be a miserable experience people are gonna hate that and I want to avoid that experience happening to anyone." (Explaining the decision to make the radar automatically available for Act 7)
- "The coins are gonna be there to buy over what upgrades so like maybe there will be a guy that wants to build a bridge But he needs a donation of 500 coins to buy the materials. So you give them the money and then the overall changes You're actually gonna affect the world by giving people money That's gonna be so cool." (Describing the purpose of Yoshi Coins)
- "There's a functionality in the Mario 64 engine where if you set the beep harm free to 255 the object does not spawn This is so fucking wild." (On discovering an obscure engine feature causing a bug)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The philosophy behind making Yoshi Coins a currency for tangible world changes and how this impacts the player's sense of agency.
- The iterative design process of the Yoshi Coin radar, balancing utility with avoiding player distraction or making treasure hunts too simplistic.

## Game Development Process
- Course 1 is considered complete after recent reworks.
- Actively working on Course 14, including designing new missions, assets, and music integration.
- Hub world development is planned for the very end of the project.
- Course 15 is already partially developed with existing assets.
- The development process is iterative, with Kaze frequently revisiting and reworking levels and features (e.g., Course 1, bridge texture in "bunny brush woods," paper airplane mission in Course 14).
- Performance optimization is an ongoing concern, especially for visually complex levels like Course 14, involving techniques like culling and addressing overdraw.
- Kaze often works on features off-stream (e.g., googly eyes on enemies) and then showcases or discusses them.
- Real hardware testing (N64) is part of the process to check frame rates and visual fidelity.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze describes himself as a "7 out of 10" designer and acknowledges that his initial ideas aren't always the best, emphasizing an iterative approach.
- He strongly prefers reworking levels to achieve higher quality, even if it means more effort, rather than leaving "the worst level" in the game.
- Kaze values player freedom and immersion, aiming to create experiences that allow players to "experience freedom and immersion."
- He expresses strong opinions on game design, art style, and even critiques other game developers (e.g., Game Freak).
- He shows a self-aware sense of humor regarding his own process and potential external perceptions (e.g., Nintendo takedowns).
- He believes contrast in gameplay (e.g., restricted movement followed by Wing Cap freedom) amplifies positive feelings for the player.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** Composer for the game. Created "so many new songs" for Course 14, with dynamic music where instruments fade in and out depending on the player's location within different "biomes" of the level. Kaze communicates with him via messages.
- **Biobak:** Graphics artist and level designer. Contributed the idea for paper fortune teller enemies ("Chubby Chai guys" as thimbles). Known for reworking levels and improving performance despite adding more content. Kaze also mentions Biobak's font.
- **Zeina(b):** Animator. Tasked with creating a new icon for Mario (presumably the player icon or a HUD element), as the current one is temporary. Also made changes to Mario's crouch animation.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **"a big":** Created textures for the new font implemented in the game.
    - **Lera:** 3D modeler. Contributed models for the game, including a target holder (designed to look plant-like). Offered to make a paper airplane model and received feedback on its design from Kaze.
    - **Stream Chat:** Kaze actively engages with his chat, sometimes incorporating their suggestions (e.g., "ball push pins" from Yoshi's Island for marking spots, confetti for cannons).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Art Style & Asset Design:** Significant time spent discussing and iterating on the bridge texture in "bunny brush woods" to make it fit the level's aesthetic. Similar detailed attention was given to creating an accurate 3D model of a folded paper airplane, including UV mapping.
- **Mission Design (Course 14):**
    - Original "Paper Airplane" star mission (collect 5 silver stars mid-flight) was critiqued by Kaze as feeling "pointless" and "stiff."
    - Proposed solution: Introduce a Wing Cap or Cloud Cap in Act 6, allowing free flight over the entire level, transforming the play experience. The paper airplane might be repurposed for a simpler task.
    - Designing challenges for the Wing Cap: Considering a "sign hunt" leading to different spots, using "X" marks on the ground, or timed challenges.
    - A key challenge is ensuring Wing Cap-exclusive areas don't become overly frustrating if the player falls and has to restart a long sequence. Cannons are considered as a way to regain height/momentum.
    - New idea: Using shootable targets (potentially held by "bubble blower" like structures that rip when flown through) instead of silver stars for a Wing Cap mission.
- **Enemy Design:** Adding googly eyes to enemies that look at the player. Biobak's idea for "Chubby Chai guys" (thimbles) as paper fortune teller enemies that spawn and attack.
- **Camera System:** Kaze encountered and debugged issues with the flying camera, particularly its auto-rotation and tilt behavior.
- **N64 Limitations:** Working within the constraints of N64 hardware, such as rules for animated skeletons (bones must point up, no roll, hierarchical attachment). Texture size and color depth limitations (e.g., 16x16 intensity alpha 8).

## Business Aspects
- No relevant information found. The stream focuses entirely on the creative and technical aspects of development.

## Key Quotes
- "I know people sometimes give me shit for putting reworks of my level in, but would you rather just have the worst level? I think I much prefer this, to be honest." (Reflects Kaze's commitment to quality and iterative design).
- "I also love the contrast this gives you between normal gameplay and gameplay with the wing cap, because contrast is really what amplifies your feeling and by having a strong contrast between non-free and free parts, the freedom is going to feel more freedom, you know what I mean?" (Explains his design philosophy for the Wing Cap feature in Course 14).
- "It's not just my game, you are helping a lot on it. It's just the the other texture just doesn't fit in the architecture, if you ask me." (Acknowledges community/collaborator contributions while asserting his design vision).

## Potential Interview Topics
1.  **The Iterative Design Philosophy:** Explore Kaze's approach to reworking levels (like Course 1 and the bridge in Course 14). Why is this iterative process crucial for "Return to Yoshi's Island," and how does he decide when a rework is necessary versus "good enough"?
2.  **Collaborative Dynamics:** Discuss how Kaze manages and integrates contributions from various artists (Badoop, Biobak, Zeina, Lera, "a big"). How are creative differences handled, and how does collaboration shape the game's direction?
3.  **Designing for "Freedom" within Constraints:** The Wing Cap concept for Course 14 aims to provide a feeling of freedom. Delve into how Kaze balances this design goal with the technical limitations of the N64 platform and the need for structured gameplay challenges.
4.  **Evolution of a Level (Course 14):** Using Course 14 as an example, trace the evolution of its design, from initial concepts for stars/missions, through critiques (like the paper airplane), to the development of new mechanics (Wing Cap, target shooting).
5.  **Community Influence on Development:** Kaze often interacts with his stream chat. How has this live feedback loop and the incorporation of community ideas (like Biobak's fortune teller enemies or chat suggestions) impacted the development of "Return to Yoshi's Island"?

    - Use of decompilation: The game is a ROM hack based on the Mario 64 decompilation.
    - Tooling: Uses Fast64 for level exporting, Blender for animations.
    - Performance Optimization for N64: Actively working on ensuring good FPS, fixing rendering issues (e.g., anti-aliasing, Z-ordering) on actual hardware.

## Personal Insights
- **On the Development Process:**
    - Finds programming complex physics (like the paper plane) challenging and time-consuming: "I didn't think that programming a paper plane was going to be this much of a problem."
    - Prefers creating physics-based systems over pre-scripted animations for a more dynamic feel, even if it's harder: "doing these computations, I prefer that. That's why there's some kind of physical basis for it."
    - Values time efficiency in development: "we care about time efficiency here."
- **On Streaming Development:**
    - Experiences frustration with Twitch chat: "You know, I thought what made you insane when you rommake is like the rommaking itself. But no, it's Twitch chat like watching you rommake." and "I often get very, very annoyed at chat when they just ask really stupid questions."
    - Acknowledges enjoyment despite frustrations: "I do kind of really like streaming. It's just that sometimes I just can't deal with it, I think."
- **On Game Design & Industry:**
    - Confident in his project: "if you just make a hack or make a game that doesn't suck, I think it's going to be popular."
    - Critical of some existing games/trends (e.g., Battle for Bikini Bottom's simplicity, Conker's Bad Fur Day as a "clip show").
- **Future Plans:**
    - Intends to make his own original game after "Return to Yoshi's Island," likely a 3D platformer in Unreal Engine 5, or potentially his own engine.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific mention of Badub or their contributions in this transcript. Kaze does ask "What is the OST that we would like to listen to today?" but it's unclear if this refers to game-specific music by Badub.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No specific mention of Biobak or their contributions. Kaze praises some visual aspects like lighting ("The lighting on it looks so good too, though. Holy shit.") but this is not directly attributed.
- **Zeina (animations):** Kaze states, "I'm not the animator for this game anyway," indicating someone else handles primary animation work. While working on a rubber band animation in Blender, he says, "Really, I just need a decent base so that we can make this work," suggesting he might create placeholders or foundational animations.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - "GBA Mario 64 guy": Mentioned as a potential collaborator for a YouTube video, not directly for RTYI development.
    - General team implied for art/animation roles.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Paper Airplane Mechanic:**
    - **Goal:** Create a dynamic, "swoop, swoop" movement akin to a real paper plane, used as a way to ascend a pyramid in a level tentatively named "Handmade Heights."
    - **Challenge:** Achieving stable yet dynamic flight through complex physics calculations; the system is described as "volatile, chaotic." Many iterations of tweaking variables for pitch, velocity, gravity, and tipping forces.
    - **Solution:** Iterative "fudging" of physics values, experimenting with different forces and dependencies (e.g., making pitch acceleration depend on `face_angle_pitch`).
- **Level Design ("Handmade Heights" / Course 14/15):**
    - Features multiple biomes: "desert, the permits here, and then there's the mountains here with the Styrofoam... and then there is the castle here and the grasslands."
    - Incorporates unique traversal mechanics like the paper plane to reach specific areas (e.g., top of a pyramid).
- **NPC Interaction (Toad/Mr. Totodile):**
    - Designing the logic for an NPC to give Mario a star after a specific action sequence.
    - Tweaking dialogue and presentation to fit a "mechanical" theme for the cardboard cutout NPCs.
- **Slingshot/Rubber Band Animation:**
    - Challenge: Creating a realistic and satisfying elastic snap-back animation in Blender.
    - Kaze works on this himself, aiming for a "decent base" even if he's not the primary animator.
- **Technical Choices:**
    - Preference for physics-based systems over splines for certain animations to provide a "physical basis."
    - Utilizing F3DX3 for performance benefits as the game is "RSP bottlenecked."
- **Bug Fixing:**
    - Addressed a bug where pressing 'A' on the first frame out of a cannon caused issues.
    - Working on Z-ordering issues and anti-aliasing on N64.

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing & Promotion:**
    - Primarily uses his existing YouTube channel ("Kaze Emanuar") for marketing: "I feel like I do all my marketing over my main account, right?"
    - Planned YouTube content to promote the game: a video explaining VLJ, a video about his channel's direction, and then "the demo thing."
    - Considers creating separate social media for a "real game" in the future but prefers using his established presence for RTYI.
- **Audience Engagement:**
    - Views his YouTube channel (300,000 subscribers mentioned) as a significant platform for "free advertisement."
    - Plans content like a review of the Analogue 3D, seeing it as a way to reach his audience, hoping for an early copy for timely release.
- **Release/Distribution:**
    - A demo of "Return to Yoshi's Island" is "all done" and its release is part of his YouTube content plan.
- **Funding:** No direct mention of funding for the project.

## Key Quotes
- "I didn't think that programming a paper plane was going to be this much of a problem. ... This is just such a volatile, chaotic system." (Reflecting the difficulty and iterative nature of developing a core mechanic)
- "The demo is all done, by the way. I fixed all the N64 bugs." (Announcing a major project milestone)
- "You know, I thought what made you insane when you rommake is like the rommaking itself. But no, it's Twitch chat like watching you rommake." (Insight into the personal challenges of public game development)
- "Of course, I can just put it on a spline, but then I just have to add a spline and doing these computations, I prefer that. That's why there's some kind of physical basis for it." (Explaining his design philosophy for dynamic game elements)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Iterative Journey of the Paper Plane:** Explore the initial concept for the paper plane mechanic versus its final implementation. What were the biggest breakthroughs and frustrations in tuning its physics?
- **Philosophy of "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Discuss Kaze's vision for the game as a ROM hack. How does he balance homage to SM64 with introducing novel mechanics and a distinct identity? What does "making a game that doesn't suck" mean to him in this context?
- **Impact of Decompilation & N64 Limitations:** How has the SM64 decompilation project enabled RTYI? How does Kaze approach designing complex features while respecting/pushing N64 hardware limitations (e.g., RSP bottlenecks, F3DX3 usage)?

## Game Development Process
-   Currently working on "Force 14," a specific level or area in the game.
-   Focus on implementing and refining core gameplay mechanics, such as a new crayon drawing feature and "paper springs" for platforming.
-   Significant effort is being put into level design and iteration, including completely redoing sections like the "Styrofoam mountains" (planned snow biome) and the "Star of the Mountains" area to improve their quality and gameplay flow.
-   Experimentation with visual elements, such as texture filtering and HUD design, to achieve the desired aesthetic.
-   Development involves creating general-purpose functions for game objects to streamline programming (e.g., for sliding mechanics).
-   The process is highly iterative, with Kaze frequently expressing dissatisfaction with current states and a desire to rework elements until they meet his vision (e.g., "I want to redo them," "This is still not great because there's like zero creativity involved").

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze values improving upon existing concepts rather than making arbitrary changes: "We don't want to make arbitrary changes like that to something that's global across the game. When we make a change like that, we want it to be like the same thing, but improved."
-   He has a distinct vision for level design, aiming for unconventional and surprising experiences: "You kind of just need to be schizophrenic and make connections that don't actually exist in your levels to maximize on that concept." This is inspired by his re-evaluation of levels like Hazy Maze Cave from SM64.
-   Player accessibility and enjoyment are key concerns: "Someone once told me that games being difficult is like an accessibility issue. And I can kind of see that. Dude, I don't think difficulty is essential to having fun in this game."
-   He expresses strong enthusiasm for the game's unique crafty aesthetic: "And it looks like a crayon drawing. I love this."
-   Kaze openly discusses frustrations with specific development tasks, such as modeling complex geometry for the paper springs: "I still can't figure out the geometry of this thing. This is complicated."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub (composer)**: No specific contributions or mentions in this transcript.
-   **Biobak (graphics artist)**: The transcript mentions "Biobank" being thanked, potentially for a donation and providing feedback on the HUD's blurriness. It's unclear if "Biobank" is the same individual as "Biobak." "Also someone said the HUD looks bad, but they wouldn't tell me why. They said something about it being blurry, but I don't agree that it's blurry."
-   **Zeina (animations)**: Mentioned in a personal context (arranging a birthday cake, making chocolate milk for Kaze). No specific game development contributions from her are detailed in this transcript segment.
-   **Other Contributors**:
    *   **Vizzy, Finity**: Provided feedback or agreement on texture filtering attempts.
    *   **IL (chat user)**: Suggested Kaze try making a paper spring himself to understand its geometry.
    *   **Shadwick, Mario Mike (chat users)**: Offered suggestions for the star select screen design.
    *   Various chat members (Mario, Luigi, SM64, Alex Bubu, Lila, Xaraclom, Fierce Deity Layra, Loud Strife, Tea Time, Poaching30, Joseph, Gray Rose, Dashboard, Ice Place) interacted, offered feedback, subscribed, or donated, contributing to the stream environment and sometimes influencing small decisions (e.g., song choice, crayon color idea).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Crayon Drawing Mechanic**: A new feature allowing players to draw with a crayon/marker. Drawing on a star object grants the player a star. An idea to change the crayon's color (e.g., to blue) after specific interactions was noted.
-   **Paper Springs**: Introducing a new platforming element. Challenges included accurately modeling the 3D geometry of a folded paper spring ("This is deceptively a lot more complicated than it looks") and tuning its physics to be predictable and fun for the player, rather than strictly realistic.
-   **Level Redesign and Thematic Cohesion**: Redoing the "Styrofoam mountains" into a snow biome. A key challenge is designing the quest to retrieve Luigi's lost crayon to feel like a "journey" with meaningful obstacles and progression, rather than a simple fetch quest. This involves brainstorming mechanics like breakable blocks, buttons opening paths, or using the crayon to reveal elements.
-   **"Schizophrenic" Level Design Philosophy**: A deliberate choice to incorporate "random shit" and "make connections that don't exist" in level design to create surprising and memorable player experiences, inspired by elements like Dory in Hazy Maze Cave.
-   **Difficulty and Player Experience**: Actively working to avoid overly difficult or "jank" platforming sections. For instance, adjusting a challenging jump in the "Force 14" red coin area to be more manageable ("We gotta make it easier somehow"). The goal is an accessible game where difficulty can be self-imposed by players.
-   **HUD and Visuals**: Experimenting with texture filtering for the HUD and game world, ultimately deciding against filtering for the HUD to maintain clarity and improve upon the original SM64 HUD.
-   **Discoverability of Secrets/Entrances**: Rethinking the placement of the "bit pipe" entrance to make it more noticeable and considering new mechanics for accessing it, such as drawing invisible platforms with the crayon.

## Business Aspects
-   Kaze humorously discusses unconventional marketing ideas: "What if I start marketing myself like either a rapper or one of those comedians that keep talking about how they're going to get canceled?" and "I could like go to prison for like two years for copyright infringement and then like come out and be like my game is so good."
-   He dismisses the idea of "selling out" to specific demographics, suggesting the potential audience isn't large enough to justify it.
-   He views interactions like tweeting at Nintendo for rights as jokes, not serious legal or business strategies, understanding that large companies make calculated decisions.

## Key Quotes
-   "Look, I added a cool pastel crayon... You can draw with a marker. Isn't this amazing? ... And if you color the star, you get a star. How cool is that? And it looks like a crayon drawing. I love this." (Describing a core new mechanic and aesthetic element.)
-   "So the Styrofoam mountains, I have decided they're terrible. And I want to redo them... Because we want this to be kind of like the snow biome. Where Luigi loses his crayon. And then we want it to be kind of like a challenge to bring it back." (Illustrating iterative design and linking level theme to a gameplay objective.)
-   "You kind of just need to be schizophrenic and make connections that don't actually exist in your levels to maximize on that concept... Just do the most random shit imaginable. Make connections that don't exist." (Articulating a core, unconventional level design philosophy.)

## Potential Interview Topics
-   Explore the origins and evolution of the "pastel crayon" / craft aesthetic for "Return to Yoshi's Island" and how it influences gameplay mechanics beyond visuals.
-   Discuss Kaze's philosophy of "schizophrenic level design" in more depth: how does he balance randomness with cohesive gameplay, and what are his inspirations for these unexpected connections?
-   Delve into the challenges and decision-making process behind making the game accessible while still offering depth, particularly his views on difficulty as an "accessibility issue" versus self-imposed challenges.
-   Ask about the process of taking abstract ideas from the community (like the crayon turning blue or HUD feedback) and integrating them technically and creatively into the game.
-   Inquire about the narrative concept of Luigi losing his crayon and the design goals for making its retrieval a "journey." How does he plan to implement mechanics (like drawing to reveal paths) to support this?

## Game Development Process
- Overall Progress: Actively developing specific levels (e.g., "Course 14" with snow/craft theme) and implementing mechanics (bridge, snowballs, confetti). Work includes refining existing systems like coin collection and star mechanics.
- Major Milestones: A public demo is planned for release "in a few weeks" to showcase improvements and manage community expectations. Kaze mentions a to-do list and being in the "last three areas" for a certain scope of work, suggesting progress towards completion of specific sections.
- Development Stages: The stream shows live development, including modeling, texturing (placeholders), programming new behaviors (matchbox bridge, paper snowballs, confetti), and level design. Iteration is a key part of the process.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze prioritizes getting work done on stream over direct entertainment, stating "my priority today is not on entertaining but rather on getting work done... entertainment today will be coincidental."
- He expresses satisfaction with certain aesthetic choices, such as the "crayon drawing" look of a level element: "you know what i love the most about this it actually ends up looking like a crayon drawing once you're done here... this does look like someone's shitty crayon drawing..."
- He reflects on development tools for future projects, expressing a preference for Godot over Unreal Engine 5 for indie development due to iteration speed: "So the cool thing about Godot over Unreal Engine is that iteration is a lot faster... I think it's gonna be a lot more viable for development than Unreal Engine, because Unreal Engine is so goddamn slow."
- He has a direct and sometimes provocative communication style, e.g., his response to a Nintendo DMCA: "I responded to the email with just suck my cock... And nothing happened."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Biobak:
    - Kaze consults Biobak for opinions on visual elements: "Biobank what do you think of the new styrofoam? your opinion here matters."
    - Potentially tasked with creating assets like a new exclamation box: "Oh yeah, I also want to make a new exclamation box... Do you want to give it a try, if you're still here? [Biobak implied]"
- Zeina:
    - Kaze might ask Zeina to create final textures for assets he makes placeholders for: "I might ask Zeyna to make a good version of it [the matchbox texture]." (The prompt mentioned animations for Zeina, but this transcript refers to texture work).
- Other Contributors:
    - Lila (chat user): Suggested matchbox brand names "Game & Match" and "Lethal Lava Logs," which Kaze liked and decided to use.
    - Mushi (chat user): Kaze solicits their opinion on new assets (e.g., the hut) and discusses design changes with them.
    - Unnamed "guy in my showcase channel": Created a model for an exclamation box that Kaze considered using.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Coin System Overhaul:**
    - Red coins are now localized to specific areas to be less frustrating: "red coins in this game are always contained to one area because otherwise red coins suck."
    - Yoshi coins are awarded for "really rare special interactions" and exploring unconventional areas. They are "stored globally" like "mini objectives."
    - 100-coin stars have been completely removed: "no level has a 100 coin star not a single one."
- **Star Collection & Level Progression:**
    - There are seven "acts" (stars) per level. The 7th star is "find the egg coins" and features a radar mechanic.
    - Deliberate decisions on whether collecting a star kicks the player out of the level: "a lot of surf stars have to kick you out because otherwise you would just be stuck in the dead end... red coins just don't kick you out and yoshi coins does kick you out [mistake, later clarifies collect-a-thon stars don't kick you out]." Later corrected: "any collect text y star doesn't kick you out".
- **Level-Specific Mechanics & Aesthetics (Course 14 - Snow/Craft Theme):**
    - Crayon drawing aesthetic: "it actually ends up looking like a crayon drawing." The crayon is a pickup item used to draw a star.
    - Temporary bridge: Iterated from simple cardboard to a matchbox design suggested by chat. Involves a timed mechanism.
    - Snowball enemies: Design iterated from cotton to crumpled paper. They target Mario.
    - Particle effects: Paper snowflakes as environmental confetti.
- **Challenges:**
    - Designing and implementing level-specific interactive elements (bridge, snowball spawner).
    - Achieving desired visual effects and aesthetics (e.g., making convincing "craft" snowballs, matchbox textures).
    - Resolving technical issues like lighting inconsistencies: "it's a bit weird how the light on this looks... i don't understand why this one is so dark compared to the top one."
    - Reusing mechanics: The crayon will be used to color a map to reveal a path elsewhere.

## Business Aspects
- **Distribution:** The game will be a free download: "Of course it will be free download. I can't charge money for this, Nintendo would actually murder me."
- **Marketing/Release:**
    - A demo is planned "in a few weeks" to show improvements and "some people leave me alone and stop asking me for release dates."
    - Kaze plans other YouTube videos (BLJ video, "what am I doing on this channel" video) before the demo release, indicating a content schedule around his development.
- **Funding:** No direct funding for the game itself is mentioned, though Kaze acknowledges Twitch Prime money from viewers during the stream.

## Key Quotes
- "red coins in this game are always contained to one area because otherwise red coins suck... and the yoshi coins you get them for really rare special interactions so you have to do things that others would not really think of or go places that you usually wouldn't go to." (Explaining core design changes)
- "my priority today is not on entertaining but rather on getting work done... entertainment today will be coincidental which i think is how my streams should be anyway" (On his streaming and development philosophy)
- "Okay, I know I can't draw textures, which is why I'm going to make a temporary texture with the name of it on it... I might ask Zeyna to make a good version of it." (Highlighting the iterative and collaborative nature of asset creation)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore the core design philosophy behind "Return to Yoshi's Island," particularly the motivations for overhauling SM64's collectible systems (Red Coins, Yoshi Coins, 100-coin star removal).
- Discuss the iterative design process for level-specific mechanics, using the matchbox bridge in Course 14 as an example, including how community feedback is incorporated.
- Detail the collaboration process with artists like Biobak and Zeyna: How are creative visions aligned? How is work distributed and feedback managed for assets like textures and models?
- Delve into the inspiration and technical/artistic challenges of achieving the "craft" or "crayon drawing" aesthetic for certain levels, and how this theme influences gameplay mechanics.
- Kaze's perspective on the N64 ROM hacking scene, the impact of the SM64 decompilation, and his thoughts on navigating legal concerns (like DMCAs) as a prominent figure in the community.

- Significant time is spent on bug fixing, particularly for a "snow bug" and various crashes, many of which are emulator-specific.
- Kaze is actively working on optimizations. He mentions a "cool optimization" for the snow effect and notes that since a previous "Source Code video," he has made the game "like twice as fast again."
- The development process involves iterative design, such as deciding on the placement of features ("I think we said we want the zipper to be around here") and addressing visual elements like the styrofoam texture.
- Kaze is working on implementing tilting platforms and ensuring their difficulty is balanced.
- The project leverages the Mario 64 decompilation ("My new physics are on Decomp").

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong passion for game development ("I just want to make games, man.") despite frustrations.
- He frequently voices frustration with emulator inaccuracies and bugs ("This garbage emulator man I swear. I hate emulators," "The worst problem is that on real n64 it legit just works").
- Kaze takes pride in the project, stating, "There is a lot of work behind this game. I'm going to say this is the first quadruple A N64 game ever."
- He finds certain development tasks tedious, such as fixing emulator-specific crashes ("Man this is not a good day for modding," "This is just a mess").
- He reflects on the challenges of content creation for YouTube, stating, "It was up to me, I just wouldn't make videos at all, but then I can't do my thing as a hobby. That makes money."
- Kaze acknowledges the difficulty and sometimes tedious nature of deep debugging ("Well, this is what programming is like. If you want to be a real big-boy programmer.").

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No *direct* mention of Badub's specific contributions in this transcript, though Kaze praises the game's LST (soundtrack) ("This LST is a banger.").
- **Biobak (graphics artist; referred to as "Biomech" or "Biobank" in transcript):**
    - Described as someone who is there "to make them [maps] prettier" rather than primarily optimizing, though "he sometimes finds some optimizations."
    - Kaze actively incorporates Biobak's suggestions, for example, regarding the visual treatment of level edges ("we're going to go with Biomech's idea to... put smooth edges around the rim").
    - Kaze expresses approval of Biobak's ideas ("Yeah, I think it will be fine. I think that was a good idea by Biomech.").
- **Zeina (animations):** No *direct* mention of Zeina's specific animation contributions to RTYI in this transcript. It is mentioned that "One of Xena's friends installed" Kaze's N64 Digital mod.

    - **Chat users (e.g., Cosmog, those providing suggestions):** Kaze interacts with his stream chat, sometimes discussing ideas or showing specific progress to users like Cosmog ("I just ported this to my current engine, just because I wanted to see how well it runs. Look at that. Easy 30 fps on N64... Then, I think showing you this made your mode go even harder."). Ideas from chat (attributed to "Biobank," likely Biobak) are considered and implemented.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Aesthetic Choices:**
    - The craft-based theme is prominent (cardboard, paper, staples, "mushrooms here that are just an inverted plate with a toilet roll").
    - Kaze debates the "normal map styrofoam" effect, questioning its appearance and performance, ultimately deciding to "replace styrofoam with cardboard and paper staple."
    - Discussion on how to represent the "death void" below levels, considering options like a table, white void, or a gradient blue void suggested by Biobak.
- **Level Design (Course 15):**
    - Planning a "zipper to hell" (a lava area).
    - Designing platforming sections, including tilting platforms, and tuning their difficulty ("Okay, now I made it too easy").
    - Considering player guidance and preventing them from jumping to their death ("I also really want to prevent the player thinking that they can jump down and see something down there").
- **Technical Challenges & Solutions:**
    - **Emulator Issues:** A major recurring challenge is dealing with emulator-specific crashes and behaviors that don't occur on real N64 hardware or other emulators. This consumes significant debugging time ("The worst problem is that on real n64 it legit just works"). Kaze mentions specific issues with Project64 and Parallel Launcher.
    - **Performance Optimization:** Constant effort to maintain good frame rates (aiming for 30 FPS) on N64 hardware. This involves optimizing code, effects (e.g., snow), and level geometry. He discusses the performance cost of anti-aliasing and mipmapping.
    - **Memory Management/Corruption:** Investigating crashes potentially caused by memory allocation issues ("Surely this isn't too big an allocation," "What if this caused some kind of memory corruption somehow?").
    - **Visual Effects:** Implementing and debugging complex visual effects like snow particles and normal mapping for grass/styrofoam, ensuring they work correctly and perform well.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Discussion of "vanilla behavior" from Mario 64 and whether to retain or change it (e.g., camera behavior when hitting 'C' while running).
    - Adjusting the sensitivity of tilting platforms.

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing:** Kaze jokingly suggests a marketing angle: "I'm going to say this is the first quadruple A N64 game ever. That's going to be the marketing."
- **Potential Commercial Release (PC/Steam):**
    - Kaze considers the possibility of porting the game to PC and releasing it on Steam.
    - This would necessitate removing all Mario assets to avoid legal issues with Nintendo ("If I were to release this game on Steam, obviously I would have to remove all the Mario assets though... Nintendo would sue").
    - He mentions considering pricing ("$20? $10? I'm not sure. I'll have to think about it. Do some market research").
- **Monetization of Content:** Kaze mentions experimenting with Twitter for "cloud" (clout/engagement) which could lead to monetization, and that making YouTube videos helps fund his hobby.

## Game Development Process
- Significant progress reported over the "last few weeks," with enough content for multiple video clips.
- Current focus involves working on implementing and debugging "little actors" and specific game mechanics, such as a box-opening mechanism.
- A core aspect of the development is Kaze "rewriting Mario 64," which is a substantial undertaking he is considering making a video about.
- Performance optimization is an ongoing concern, with adjustments made to elements like drawing distance to improve frame rates.
- The game includes unique level concepts, like a "swamp" area and a "cardboard box to hell."
- Kaze is implementing a "Yoshi Stars" system, similar to Mario Galaxy's comets, offering special missions for stars (e.g., "get the red coins with two or less A presses"). 45 are planned.
- The development involves detailed animation work, such as for the box opening tab and enhancing the Mario model.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze aims for a specific game feel: "it feels very risky to play, I think. So it's fine if it's not super difficult, like that actually is desirable, it's not difficult."
- He prioritizes thematic consistency in design: "Don't want to make a Romic exhibiting random technology. That's not what I'm interested in."
- Kaze is deeply immersed in the development process: "I just make games. I don't have space in my brain to think about those things" (re: tracking time spent on levels).
- He acknowledges the rarity of completed mods: "Most mods never get finished. It's very rare that a mod gets finished, you guys are just spoiled because you are watching me."
- He expresses clear opinions on various topics, including public figures and industry practices, and shares personal background details (German living in Canada, studied mathematics).

    - **Arthur Tilly:** Appears to be a viewer/commenter Kaze interacts with.
    - **Tito:** A viewer who thanked Kaze.
    - **DeathWizard:** Mentioned as the creator of a "Mario 64 Wordle," not a direct collaborator on "Return to Yoshi's Island."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Box Opening Mechanic:** Iterative design process for opening a "cardboard box to hell." Ideas explored included a zipper, a piece of tape, staples, and finally a "cardboard box opener" tab that Mario pulls. Challenges included animating this tab smoothly and making it look convincing without being too performance-intensive.
- **Mario Model Enhancement:** The Mario model is an "HD-ified version" with more details, including a nose that jiggles, 3D buttons on his overalls, glove textures, and a color line on his shoes.
- **Performance Optimization:** Addressed poor performance by adjusting the drawing distance for objects, which was previously set to infinite. Also, optimizing materials in levels (e.g., mountain textures).
- **Debugging:** Significant time spent debugging issues, such as:
    - A bug causing Mario to let go of Bowser unexpectedly, which seemed to be emulator-specific (Project 64 vs. Nemu) and was eventually traced to code related to resetting the intro scene and an incorrect use of "action arc" vs. "action state."
    - Visual glitches with animations (e.g., the box opening tab "curling").
    - Collision problems.
- **Level Aesthetics:** Trying to achieve a specific "crafty" look, like "paper on paper," for level elements like the floor, and finding it "hard to reach."
- **Yoshi Stars Implementation:** Designing missions for the "Yoshi Stars" that add optional challenges.

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube Content Strategy:** Kaze actively thinks about video titles for engagement, such as "why I've been rewriting Mario 64." He plans videos to showcase his work.
- **Monetization:** Mentions that "Twitter monetization grind is going way better than I thought."
- **YouTube Shorts Evaluation:** Experimented with YouTube Shorts but found them to be a poor return on investment: "The problem is with shots, you're never going to make the money back... investment wise, has not been a wise decision." He also set his shorts to not be pushed to subscribers, treating it as an experiment.
- No direct mentions of funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island" or specific release/distribution plans for the game itself were found in this transcript.

## Key Quotes
- "This is kind of how I envisioned this. This is like, it feels very risky to play, I think. So it's fine if it's not super difficult, like that actually is desirable, it's not difficult." (On game feel)
- "Don't want to make a Romic exhibiting random technology. That's not what I'm interested in." (On design philosophy)
- "Most mods never get finished. It's very rare that a mod gets finished, you guys are just spoiled because you are watching me." (On the nature of game modding)
- "The reason it ran poorly is because back from my other RoMac, I still had the drawing distance for everything set at infinite." (On a specific technical challenge and solution)

## Game Development Process
- Currently focused on designing and implementing a sub-area for a level (referred to as "Arts and Crafts stage" or "cardboard level"), which involves platforming over a void/lava on falling platforms.
- Key mechanics being implemented/refined in this area:
    - Two main platform designs that can be scaled and colored.
    - Saws between platforms that activate when the player gets close, forcing fast movement.
    - The platforms themselves fall after a certain trigger or proximity.
- Iterating on level layout, platform placement, scaling (using "B Berms"), and visual elements (textures, random colors for platforms).
- A "Chorus 1 demo" is still planned and will include a hidden N64 version of Delfino Plaza as an unlockable.
- Working on fixing bugs like "underflow" and "overflow" errors, and addressing asset scaling issues between Blender and the game engine.
- Considering environmental aesthetics, such as a "black and white" or "painted" look for certain areas, while being mindful of issues like texture repetition.
- Experimenting with new movement mechanics, such as a "long jump to force a front flip."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze's primary passion is game development itself; creating YouTube videos is seen as a way to make money to support this passion, rather than a passion in itself.
- He has strong opinions on game design, preferring fewer explicit options for players and valuing speedruns that remain recognizable to casual gameplay.
- He is candid about the frustrations and tedious aspects of development (e.g., "Doing this right now kind of sucks and I don't like it," referring to a specific task).
- He enjoys discussing the technical aspects of his work, like optimizations he has found.
- He is critical of design choices in other popular games (e.g., his critique of *Tears of the Kingdom*'s puzzle design and overpowered solutions).
- He expresses confidence in his own Mario 64 gameplay skills.

- Biobak: No specific mention of current contributions in this transcript.
- Zeina: Mentioned in a personal context ("Xena takes so long out of bed"), implying a close daily life connection. The prompt implies she works on animations, but this transcript doesn't detail her current game contributions.
- Other Contributors:
    - **Sauron:** Mentioned as a potential source of technical errors Kaze encounters ("If it's Sauron's fault then I won't even mention them..."). This suggests Sauron is involved in a technical capacity, perhaps developing tools or engine components Kaze uses.
    - **Lila (also referred to as Lina):** A prominent viewer in the chat who Kaze interacts with frequently, often in a teasing manner regarding bug reports or comments. Seems to be an active community member providing feedback.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Decisions:**
    - Implementing a specific level concept: a race-like experience across falling cardboard platforms with saws, over lava or an abyss.
    - Using two primary platform types with variable scaling and color for visual variety and design flexibility.
    - Introducing a new jump mechanic (long jump into a front flip).
    - Making the environment for the current sub-area "arbitrary," possibly with a black and white or painted aesthetic.
    - Hiding a significant piece of content (Delfino Plaza N64) in the upcoming demo.
- **Challenges:**
    - **Technical Bugs:** Encountering and fixing "underflow" and "overflow" errors.
    - **Asset Pipeline:** Significant discrepancies in how objects (especially scaled ones) appear in Blender versus the Mario 64 engine ("Dude how is this so fucked there's clearly a large difference...").
    - **Visuals:** Finding a good solution for floor textures to avoid excessive repetition, especially with a "painted" style.
    - **Mechanics Implementation:** Ensuring complex interactions work as intended (e.g., bombs correctly navigating turns on a conveyor).
    - **Emulator Issues:** Dealing with quirks and bugs in emulators used for development and testing (e.g., Parallel Launcher not rendering coins correctly for him).
    - **Difficulty Balancing:** Adjusting platform spacing and timing to be challenging but not unfairly punishing.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization/Funding:** Kaze explicitly states that making YouTube videos is "a way to make money" to support his primary goal of making the game.
- **Marketing/Promotion:** He uses YouTube streaming and video uploads to engage with an audience and test content ideas (e.g., the BLJ video was an experiment). He monitors video performance (views).
- **Release/Distribution:** A "Chorus 1 demo" is a planned release. He also speculates on potential speedrun times for the final game, indicating thought towards its post-release life.

## Key Quotes
- "My passion is not making YouTube videos it is making the video [game]... Making YouTube videos, for me, that's just a way to make money." (Clarifies his motivations and priorities).
- "So the idea is I have these two platform designs and I can place these platforms as I want around the level. And there's going to be saws between the platforms. And when you get close enough to a saw, the saw starts going. So you do have to constantly move pretty fast to not die in this level." (Explains a core design philosophy for a current level).
- "Dude how is this so fucked there's clearly a large difference Between how all of this is applied in blender versus in Mario 64 That is so weird." (Highlights a significant technical challenge in the development pipeline).

## Game Development Process
- Active development is focused on Course 14 (papercraft level, pyramid interior sub-area) and Course 15 ("war level," difficult sub-area completed off-stream).
- Course 14 is nearing completion, with "only two areas missing in the papercraft level."
- A demo for Course 1 is considered "fully finished" and just needs to be "made ready."
- Kaze mentions significant work ("a lot of stuff done") happens off-stream.
- The project involves iterative design, with ideas being brainstormed, implemented, tested, and sometimes discarded.
- Bug fixing is an ongoing part of the process (e.g., the newly discovered BLJ bug).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze believes "a little bit of difficulty is fun" and intentionally designs challenging sections, while also being wary of making them *too* difficult.
- He values world-building and the "in-between" moments in games, drawing inspiration from "Majora's Mask."
- He expresses a desire for players to experience initial confusion that resolves into understanding, rather than straightforward guidance.
- Kaze is open about his development process, including frustrations and changes in direction (e.g., "This layout sucks").
- He has specific preferences for game mechanics, such as not wanting the 100-coin star to be part of 100% completion.
- He reflects on past projects and collaborations, and shares opinions on other games (e.g., disliking Mario 64 DS).

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** Not explicitly mentioned for "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript, but Kaze references his music for "Zero Worlds," indicating a past working relationship as a composer.
- **Biobak:** A graphics artist who provides suggestions on visual elements. For instance, "Biobank was saying maybe cardboard where paper is stapled onto it" as an alternative to a Styrofoam look. Kaze also mentions discussing Twitter analytics with him.
- **Zeina (Zaina):** Heavily involved in playtesting, particularly for difficult sections. Kaze notes, "when Zaina played and she had trouble beating it [Course 15 sub-area], But I think the difficulty is fine considering its course 15." She serves as a benchmark for difficulty. Kaze also mentions general discussions, "me and now do two minutes of story."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Kinokyo:** Mentioned as having made a level "so pretty" in another of Kaze's ROM hacks.
    - **Chat members (Chris, James, Parker, Links, Sarah, etc.):** Contribute suggestions and engage in discussions during the stream, influencing Kaze's thought process.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Pyramid Interior (Course 14 Sub-area):**
    - Goal: Create a "contrived cave system," initially confusing but ultimately understandable, not a true labyrinth. "The confusion needs to resolve."
    - Ideas explored: Landmarks, visible maze structures, three stories, one-way paths, color-coding, a large central cliff revealing paths, and finally settling on "one main path with a bunch of small paths along it that connect back to the main path" for the 8 red coins.
    - Challenge: Avoiding strategies like "follow the left wall" by using one-way paths to force engagement.
- **Difficulty Balancing:** A recurring concern, especially for later courses like Course 15. Kaze aims for challenging but fair gameplay, using Zeina's feedback.
- **Course 15 Sub-area:** Designed to be "by far the most difficult area in the game," featuring timed saws with rubber-banding speed and color-coded elements.
- **Global Coin System:** Discussing how to make players aware that coins are global and not per-level for a 100-coin star. Ideas include starting the player with coins or using a four-digit coin counter.
- **Bug Fixing:** The accidental discovery of a BLJ (Backwards Long Jump) bug is noted as "a very important bug to fix."
- **Aesthetics:** The papercraft theme of Course 14 presents unique visual challenges, like making Styrofoam look good.

## Business Aspects
- **Social Media Marketing:** Kaze discusses Twitter posting times for better visibility ("if you don't post at a certain time of the day, then no one sees it") and schedules posts. He also notes Twitter impression numbers and speculates on potential ad revenue, though not as a primary income.
- **Monetization (Indirect):** Kaze shares his YouTube analytics, stating he made "$900 this month" or "$10,000 in a year" from YouTube, which supports his work but is "not that much."
- **Release Plans:** A "release will be tomorrow" comment is likely a stream joke. However, a demo for Course 1 is genuinely being prepared. The original RTYI demo timeline (3-4 months for 4 levels) and a full polish timeline (end of 2024) are mentioned.

## Key Quotes
- "I do want this to feel like a contrived Have system almost but not like a labyrinth So that's hard to do I The confusion needs to resolve that's a difficult part here." (On the pyramid level design philosophy)
- "This is definitely the hardest star in the game so far... I Think it's really really cool to just worry that it's too difficult." (On balancing challenge and playability)
- "But the idea of one main path with a bunch of small paths along it that connect back to the main path, I think that works." (On settling on a design for the pyramid interior after much brainstorming)

## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus (Pyramid Level):** Kaze has finished the layout for a "pyramid thing" (a desert pyramid level, part of a larger cardboard-themed stage) and is moving on to texturing. This level is undergoing significant iteration, with an initial design being scrapped in favor of a new concept involving a central room with multiple exits and instant warps.
- **Overall Progress:** The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is reportedly in its later stages, with Kaze mentioning, "can you believe we're like on the last two courses it's crazy."
- **Projected Timeline:** Main content completion is anticipated for 2025, to be followed by beta testing and bug fixing. Kaze states, "2025, we're probably going to finish all the main content in 2025, but there's still beta left. Testing and bug fixing to be done keep in mind this is like quest 14 so like the main I mean I do have had people test individual levels but the official playlist has not started yet."
- **Engine and Tools:** Kaze is using his own engine, "Kanki," and Blender with a script called "Fast64" to export assets to N64 formats.
- **Development Philosophy:** The process is highly iterative, involving testing, player feedback (from stream chat), and willingness to discard and rework significant portions of levels.

## Personal Insights
- **On Design Complexity:** Kaze acknowledges some designs are "dangerous" or potentially confusing for players initially: "I Don't think this is a bad design. I think it's like confusing at first And it might be something that the players won't understand at first But it's like you go through it once and I think then you will understand it." He later revises the pyramid design to be more manageable.
- **Desire for Innovation:** He expresses a desire to create novel experiences: "I wanted to try something new," when discussing moving away from a more common central room design.
- **Self-Awareness of Development Risks:** Kaze is aware of the potential for Nintendo to take down the game, referring to it as a "calculated risk."
- **Player Experience as a Priority:** He frequently considers how players will perceive and navigate levels, particularly concerning difficulty, confusion, and camera angles. "The one thing I'm actually most worried about in this area is the camera."
- **On Free vs. Paid Games:** "the fact that this game doesn't cost money in a way that's really bad news for us if you have a paid video game you have an investment... if the first level is not good you're not invested right."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Involved in refining visual elements. Kaze mentions a model: "I know it looks poofy right now but biobank said it's gonna move it so I'm not worrying about it for now."
    - Biobak also seems to interact in chat, with Kaze acknowledging one of his ideas: "you had the same idea by a mic nice nice nice." (Kaze often refers to Biobak as "biomic" or "biobank" seemingly interchangeably).
- **Zeina (Animations):** Zeina is mentioned multiple times in personal anecdotes by Kaze (e.g., regarding a broken pitcher, Halloween, living situation). However, her specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" as an animator are not detailed in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **UD:** Mentioned for ripping models from "Glava" that were then used in Mario 64: "I ripped some models or UD ripped some models from Glava and we put them into Mario 64 though."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Pyramid Level Redesign:**
    - **Initial Concept:** A maze-like structure where "everything connects back to the main path." This was playtested but Kaze was unsure about it ("not sure if I like it or hate it"). Concerns included players getting lost and needing to repeat the entire maze if they missed collectibles.
    - **Challenge:** "you might go through the entire maze without collecting all eight coins, right that's actually the most likely outcome and Then you need to do it again, basically." Also, difficulty in easily returning to the top.
    - **Revised Concept (influenced by chat):** A central room with two stories and multiple exits (initially four, possibly more), with some paths being one-way and others in-and-out, incorporating "instant warps" to navigate. "One central room with two stories and for four exits And then every exit is a red coin or maybe more than four."
- **Camera Issues:** A significant and recurring challenge, especially in enclosed or complex geometric spaces. "The one thing I'm actually most worried about in this area is the camera... The only issue I have with here is that the camera a lot of the time is poopy So that's something I really need to look out for."
- **Player Navigation and Accessibility:** Designing intuitive paths and clear objectives within complex levels. For example, ensuring players can easily get back to key areas or understand the flow of interconnected tunnels.
- **Staircase Design:** Fine-tuning whether stairs can be walked up or require jumping to balance challenge and player frustration.
- **Collectible Placement:** Strategic placement of items like Yoshi coins and red coins to guide players and ensure exploration.

## Business Aspects
- **Nintendo Takedown Risk:** Kaze is highly aware of the possibility of Nintendo issuing a takedown notice for the ROM hack. He discusses it openly: "how long do you think this game will be up before nintendo takes it down... I don't know if Nintendo really would want to kill me though that for me honestly that that's like a toss-up still."
- **Release Strategy Considerations:** To potentially mitigate immediate takedown, he considers releasing a "copyright free trailer" alongside or shortly after the game's upload, a tactic used previously.
- **Monetization (or lack thereof):** The game will be free. Kaze notes this impacts player investment: "the fact that this game doesn't cost money in a way that's really bad news for us... if the first level is not good you're not invested right."
- **No Direct Funding Mentioned:** The transcript does not contain information about funding sources for the project.

## Key Quotes
- "So I finished a layout for the whole pyramid thing and now we're moving on to texturing... I Did run through this before to test the gameplay and I'm not sure if I like it or hate it It's kind of interesting It does feel maze like but because everything connects back to the main path it's like not that bad." (Illustrates iterative design and initial uncertainty)
- "Sucks I did all this but most of this is reusable. So it's fine. It's fine. It's fine." (On discarding a significant amount of work for the pyramid level, showing resilience and pragmatism)
- "I want the player to easily be able to get back up here and not have to go the entire way up the pyramid again So if there was a place here that caught you and put you back up that would be perfect." (Highlights focus on player experience and addressing design flaws)
- "it still sucks it was a calculated risk I still wanted to do it" (Regarding the potential Nintendo takedown and his determination to create the game)

## Potential Interview Topics
1.  **The Iterative Design of the Pyramid Level:** Explore the initial vision for the pyramid, the specific problems encountered during playtesting, and the collaborative process (including stream chat input) that led to its significant redesign.

## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** Kaze is working on "Course 14," with specific areas like a pyramid and an 8-bit retro section being designed. Course 14 is stated to be "almost done," and "Course 15 is also already halfway done."
- **Major Milestones:** The goal is to "finish all the main content in 2025," after which there will be "a lot of time to polish the game." This suggests a phased approach: content creation followed by polishing.
- **Development Stages:**
    - Level Design: UV mapping an area, designing platforming, adjusting area size for camera, fixing bugs related to level objects (e.g., "bump" enemies).
    - Reworks: Several courses have been reworked (Course 1, 3, 4, 5, 11). Others like "Koopa Karnal" have not yet.
    - Asset Integration: Waiting for models like "cardboard Donkey Kong and cardboard peach from Yuki."
    - Retro Section Design: A significant portion of the stream involves brainstorming and designing a "Mario Paint" themed retro section for Course 14, including mechanics for drawing and color interaction.
- **Technical Infrastructure:** Discussion on instant warps requiring a collision map, which in turn needs the "first full level" to avoid wasted time. Mention of optimizer tools ("But rama is about to make such use of your optimizer").

## Personal Insights
- **On Game Design Philosophy:** Kaze expresses strong opinions on game design, e.g., criticizing GoldenEye's controls ("aiming with a stick fucking sucks"), and preferring meaningful platforming challenges over purely aesthetic ones for retro sections. He also values using underutilized game mechanics like "exclamation boxes."
- **On Project Scope/Ambition:** He acknowledges the difficulty of certain tasks (e.g., "minty level" for the ice castle is "fucking difficult") but is committed to a long-term vision for the game.
- **On Problem Solving:** The stream showcases his iterative thought process, openly discussing challenges, brainstorming solutions with the chat, and weighing different design options (e.g., for the retro section and pipe placement).
- **On N64 Development:** He has a practical understanding of N64 limitations, such as audio quality ("we are already using the maximum that the n6 was capable of quality wise") and memory management (explaining why ROM hacks often used the expansion pack).
- **Humor and Personality:** Kaze's personality comes through with jokes (e.g., "I just made me involuntarily learn French I Will not forgive you Biobak"), personal anecdotes, and direct interaction with his audience.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):**
    - While Badub isn't explicitly named in this transcript, Kaze asks, "Do we have any OST pics for the day?" indicating music selection is an ongoing process.
    - He mentions, "We do use some stream music which sounds a lot higher quality But it eats up a lot of room space," highlighting a technical consideration related to music in the game.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Kaze mentions sending a UV-mapped area to "Biobank" (likely Biobak) who "was gonna make the colors pretty and everything." This shows Biobak's role in the visual polish and texturing of levels.
    - A humorous interaction: "I See biomech You just made me involuntarily learn French I Will not forgive you".
- **Zeina (animations):**
    - The transcript mentions Zeina in the context of level design for the ice castle: "ice castle's not done either though there's still the outside area that zena wanted to work on."
    - No specific mention of animation work by Zeina for "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this particular transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Yuki:** Kaze is "Still waiting for the cardboard Donkey Kong and cardboard peach from Yuki," indicating Yuki provides 3D models for the game.
    - **"Mario 64 GBA guy":** Kaze "scripted a banger video with the Mario 64 GBA guy," a collaboration on content separate from, but related to, the M64 modding scene.
    - **But_rama:** Mentioned in the context of an optimizer tool: "But rama is about to make such use of your optimizer." This suggests But_rama developed a tool Kaze finds useful for the project.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Design & Mechanics:**
    - **Area Adjustments:** An area was made "a little bit bigger... for the sake of the camera."
    - **Skip Removal:** Removed a "triple jump thing" and a "ground pound jump skip" to ensure intended level flow or difficulty.
    - **Enemy Behavior:** Fixing issues with "bump" enemies snapping back.
    - **Retro Section - Mario Paint:** Extensive discussion on designing this section. Initial ideas involved a 3D music scene, then a canvas where the player draws. The final concept involves:
        - Walking into a canvas to get colors (red, black, white, blue, beige, green, yellow, purple).
        - An outline of Mario's face will be provided.
        - Player walks to leave paint trails.
        - Ground pound to fill larger spots.
        - A detection algorithm to check if Mario is drawn "close enough" to award a star.
        - Specific canvas size considered: 124x124 RGBA32.
    - **Retro Section - Alternatives Considered:** Dr. Mario (falling blocks), Paper Mario (visuals fit but release date concern), Mario's Missing (rejected), Hotel Mario (rejected).
    - **Pipe Placement:** Deliberating the best location for a pipe leading to the 8-bit section in the pyramid level, considering visibility, difficulty, and player experience.
    - **Exclamation Boxes:** Kaze feels they are "very much underutilized... in this game" and wants to use them more.
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - **N64 Expansion Pack:** Kaze clarifies that most ROM hacks requiring it was due to "older tools" and "lazy" memory management, not an inherent need for the pack itself.
    - **Audio Quality vs. ROM Space:** Higher quality streamed music "eats up a lot of room space."
    - **Collision Maps & Warps:** Needing a "first full level" to efficiently create collision maps for instant warps.
    - **Polygon Count:** Considering if pencil spikes would be "too many polygons" (concludes they are fine).
- **Naming Conventions:** Brainstorming names for the ice castle level, settling on "Forgotten Fortress" after considering various options like "Polar Peak," "Mysterious Minty Manor," and "Desolate Fortress."

## Business Aspects
- **Sponsored Content (Kaze's Streaming):** Kaze mentions a sponsored stream opportunity: "I got an email today and that said that I'd play roblox for two hours they will pay me $135... So expected to our roblox stream sometime this week." He also mentions a bonus for in-game spending. This is related to Kaze's income as a streamer, not directly funding "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- **No other direct mentions of marketing, specific funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island," or detailed release/distribution plans beyond the 2025 content completion goal.**

## Key Quotes
- "So I'm mostly finished UV mapping this area here And I have some decent platforming everywhere I'm pretty happy with how this looks I mean, obviously this isn't gonna be the final look But this is what we're gonna send off to Biobank And he was gonna make the colors pretty and everything." (Shows collaboration and development stage)
- "I feel like we're definitely gonna finish all the main content in 2025 and then we have a lot of time to polish the game." (Indicates project timeline and scope)
- "Okay but imagine we have this layout here, with these colors, and then we have like dotted lines for the instruments, and you have to jump between notes, and whenever you land on a note, it makes a sound... Maybe Mario Paint just sucks as a retro section... Okay, I think our plot is solid [for the Mario Paint drawing minigame]. We just need to make Mario's face now."

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is progressing, with "Course 15" stated to be the last course, indicating the main level structure is nearing completion.
- Current development focus on stream was a "Mario Paint retro section," involving creating a minigame where the player paints Mario and an NPC evaluates it.
- This involved implementing dynamic virtual textures, a custom fill algorithm (due to N64 stack limitations), a scoring system, and modeling/integrating an NPC (the Mario Paint Robot).
- Some remaining tasks for the current course include adding "two characters for the Yoshikons."
- Ongoing bug fixing is part of the process, such as addressing score reset issues and a crash related to the Parallel RDP emulator.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a clear design philosophy, for example, regarding player consequences: "You fuck up, you lose your points... You don't get undo, but you get reset."
- He shows enthusiasm for technically innovative or "hacky" solutions, such as his exploration of the N64's "hidden" 9th bit memory and his custom fill algorithm.
- Kaze reflects on the changing internet culture and its impact on content creation, referencing his past "Trump 64" hack and why a similar project would be problematic today.
- He has a strong awareness of N64 development constraints and often tailors solutions specifically for the hardware: "I have to keep in mind we're in N64 land here."
- He often interacts with his audience, seeking opinions on design choices (like the NPC) and sharing his development journey candidly.

- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" or interactions regarding the game were mentioned in this transcript. Kaze was shown doing 3D modeling for the NPC himself.
- **Zeina (animations):** Mentioned in a personal context (playing Zelda with Kaze), but no specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" animations were discussed in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Falco:** Mentioned as someone Kaze "talked to" regarding a technical crash issue with the RTYI ROM on the Parallel RDP emulator, suggesting a role in technical consultation or community troubleshooting.
    - **Nixon:** Mentioned as someone who played a demo of Kaze's work ("Nixon's gonna play your demo and was actually really solid despite being outdated"), indicating a role as a tester or providing feedback.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Key Decisions:**
    - Creation of an in-game Mario painting minigame where player drawings are evaluated for a star.
    - Selection of the "Mario Paint Robot" as the NPC to judge the artwork, based partly on community suggestion.
    - Deliberate exclusion of an "undo" feature for the painting mechanic, opting for a "reset" button instead to maintain a sense of consequence.
    - Use of dynamically added virtual textures for the painting surface.
    - Implementing point-filtering for Mario's texture in the painting minigame for a "crisper" look.
- **Challenges Faced & Solutions:**
    - **Fill Algorithm Performance:** Standard recursive fill algorithms would overflow the N64's limited stack. Kaze "had to invent something" – a non-recursive, stack-based pixel fill method.
    - **Bug Fixing:** Addressed bugs like an infinite score exploit by ensuring the score resets correctly, requiring code refactoring.
    - **Asset Creation:** Difficulty in finding a suitable rip of the Mario Paint Robot sprite led to Kaze deciding to remake the character in 3D.
    - **Emulator Compatibility:** Encountered a persistent crash with "Return to Yoshi's Island" on the Parallel RDP plugin for emulators, which remained unresolved despite consultation.
    - **Score Logic:** Fine-tuning the scoring mechanism for the painting minigame to allow some margin of error while still requiring a recognizable Mario.

## Business Aspects
- **Marketing/Promotion:** Kaze actively uses social media (Twitter) to share progress and interesting creations from the game, such as the "MS Paint Mario 64" drawing.
- **Monetization/Funding (Indirect):** Kaze mentioned an upcoming sponsored Roblox stream ("they're paying me to play roblox"), indicating revenue generation through his streaming activities, which supports his development work.
- **Future Release Plans/IP Considerations:** Kaze discussed a long-term idea of "asset swapping Return to Yoshi's Island when it's done and releasing it under my own IP" as a potential first indie game. He acknowledged this would require legal consultation: "it's definitely something I would have to talk to a lawyer about."

## Key Quotes
- "The idea here is that you paint Mario We still need a guy somehow that looks at your Mario picture and evaluates it It tells you hey, this is a bad Mario or this is a good Mario or whatever." (Explaining the core mechanic of the Mario Paint section)
- "Remember there's a recursive function. Yeah, but the stack is not big enough for that. So I can't do that It requires a function like that will just underflow the stack So I had to invent something." (On overcoming N64 limitations for the fill algorithm)
- "Yeah, I'm planning to make indie games eventually, there is this idea of maybe asset swapping Return to Yoshi's Island when it's done and releasing it under my own IP..." (Regarding future aspirations beyond ROM hacking)

## Game Development Process
- The game is planned to have 15 courses in total. The stream focuses heavily on "Course 15," described as a "Space Arcade" and one of the final levels.
- Kaze states, "Game is nearly finished. We are getting there."
- Significant progress includes overhauling Mario's animation system for better consistency.
- The hub world is planned but will be developed "at the end."
- After Course 15, Kaze mentions needing to complete the Overworld, the Bowser level, and "three side levels missing if you include the Bowser one."
- A "bomb cap level" (likely an existing course or area) is undergoing a significant rework, with Kaze integrating changes from a collaborator (Biobak).
- Debugging technical issues, particularly collision map problems and game crashes in the reworked bomb cap level, is a current focus.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze values "crazy ideas" in game design but also emphasizes consistency: "It's not necessarily about what's fun, but rather what's consistent with the rest of the game."
- He expresses frustration with technical limitations and bugs but is persistent in solving them: "Man, this is such a difficult level to map out... I think my main problem is that I don't like the color palette we have." Later, "I'm just going to finish the collision map. We have to do that anyway. And if it still doesn't work, then we can figure it out."
- He has strong opinions on other games, e.g., "Fuck Yoshi's Island DS," and believes Twilight Princess feels "unfinished," indicating a critical and analytical approach to game design.
- Kaze reflects on his own creative process and vision: "I had an idea that is so good. You will love it. I have to do this. You will see this and shit your pants."
- He acknowledges the iterative nature of development: "A lot of it was collision mapping. I haven't spent much time figuring out the crash at all. I've just been doing other useful things that might be solving the thing."
- On working in a large company vs. independently: "In a big company, the way you work is very different from what I do here. What I do here is basically I call all the shots... I wouldn't be able to just make a full game if I was working at like a company like that."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No direct mention of Badub or specific contributions to RTYI's music in this transcript. Kaze does say, "Oh, we already have the music in," for one level, and later asks chat for "OST wishes," implying he handles some music selection/integration.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** Heavily involved in the visual rework of the "bomb cap level." Kaze reviews Biobak's updated models, textures, and lighting, providing feedback and making adjustments. Examples: "Oh, this is already a sick texture I'm seeing. Let's see what we've got. All right. General. Fine. Update the lighting. Textures and some geo." and "This is a really nice idea though, holy shit" (referring to a texture). Biobak also had the idea for "Biobank's window idea, a hit the lights type game" for Course 15.
- **Zeina (animations):** Mentioned once in a personal, non-work-related anecdote: "Zaina sometimes makes the bed..." No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this transcript, though Kaze mentions earlier overhauling Mario's animation system himself.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Spiralback:** Credited with the idea for Course 15's central feature: "This is Spiralbacks idea. A giant rocket that's the casino."
    - **Arthur Tilley:** Credited with an idea for a star in Course 15: "this last bit pipe, this was Arthur Tilley's idea, it takes you to Mario 64."
    - **Chat members (Lila, Davy, etc.):** Provide real-time feedback and suggestions, some of which Kaze acknowledges or incorporates (e.g., noting down a to-do item based on Davy's suggestion for a seven-segment counter).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Course 15 (Space Arcade) Design:**
    - Theme: An arcade in space, not a casino, with a "big rocket in the middle" (Spiralback's idea).
    - Star Concepts: Ideas include a whack-a-mole game, a rhythm game, a Skee-Ball game (shooting a cannon), a pinball-themed platforming section (inspired by Casino Night Zone), and a "bit pipe" leading to a Mario 64 retro section (Arthur Tilley's idea).
    - Additional Arcade Game Ideas: A "dumbed down version of Star Fox 64," a "hit the lights type game," "walk over pixel art to turn on all the pixels," and a memory-based path.
    - Aesthetic Challenges: Kaze struggles with the color palette ("Something about the color palette here just doesn't feel right to me") and visual elements like "ugly arcade carpet."
- **Mario 64 Retro Section (Star 6 of Course 15):**
    - Concept: Short sections or "chunks referencing parts of Mario 64 levels," not full remakes, presented as a "combined diorama."
    - Art Style: Aims to make them "prettier" than original SM64 visuals with "proper lighting" and better texture use, while still evoking the original art style.
    - Purpose: To create a contrast with RTYI levels and appeal to players who grew up with SM64.
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - Rendering: Experimenting with effects like "additive color" and dealing with rendering order for visual elements.
    - Collision and Performance: Significant time spent debugging collision map issues in the reworked "bomb cap level," leading to crashes due to data overflow or actor limits. Kaze works on optimizing triangle counts.
    - Tooling Bugs: A suspected bug in "Fast64" (an exporting tool) affecting texture display, requiring workarounds.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Low gravity zones planned for the bomb cap level.
    - Discussion on how to make a "bomb cap tutorial" immediately obvious to players.
    - General philosophy: "You want to add mechanics to present interesting concepts to the player, not just for the sake of adding more mechanics."
    - Three "Yoshi stars" (like green stars) per main level.

## Business Aspects
- No direct mentions of marketing, funding, or specific release/distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Kaze mentions he will "make the board public" (likely referring to the game's assets or source for others to use/learn from), which could be seen as a form of community engagement or distribution of resources.

## Key Quotes
- "Game is nearly finished. We are getting there. It is not a casino. It is an arcade." (Progress and theme clarification)
- "This is the best idea. I think I told you guys. There was a guy that wanted to give us better internet... Now, they have dropped their router into our basement. I haven't signed the contract. I'm not paying for that." (Illustrative of Kaze's personality and problem-solving, albeit unrelated to game dev directly).
- "Star six, of course, is a bit pipe. And I'm thinking this last bit pipe, this was Arthur Tilley's idea, it takes you to Mario 64. And we're going to make very short sections of a bunch of Mario 64 levels. And I think the contrast between Mario 64 levels and RTYI levels is going to be beautiful at display here." (Key design decision for a major level feature).
- "It's not necessarily about what's fun, but rather what's consistent with the rest of the game. If something is so different from the rest of the game, then like, you're going to limit the amount of players that enjoy your game, I guess." (Kaze's design philosophy).
- "The problem is the collision map. The engine by default can only handle like, I think like 5,000 collisions in the collision map. And because I haven't made a collision map yet, it's like 8,000 almost?" (Highlighting a major technical challenge).

## Potential Interview Topics
- The collaborative process with artists like Biobak: How are ideas exchanged, feedback given, and assets integrated, especially when working remotely or asynchronously?

- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No direct mention by name, but Kaze states, "We already got a lot of assets for it done that you can see floating through space here in the backgrounds... Using assets these assets weren't a scuttlebug hack, but they were made for this ROM hack." This implies significant graphical asset work has been completed, presumably by artists like Biobak.
- **Zeina (animations):** No direct mention or information about Zeina's contributions in this specific transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Chris15:** Credited with the theme for Course 15: "Chris15's theme is Space Arcade." This suggests a conceptual contribution for the level.
    - **DanGPTV:** Mentioned as another creator whose work Kaze is aware of. Kaze checked if an idea was "stolen from Dan" and decided against it as DanGPTV had already implemented something similar. Not a direct collaborator, but an influence/community figure.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Course 15 ("Asteroid Arcade") Design:**
    - **Core Goals:** "Fun, freedom," evoke "awe," create an "adventure into space."
    - **Main Challenge:** Achieving a sense of openness and player freedom while ensuring clear goals and avoiding excessive linearity. Kaze states, "How do we make it feel open despite being linear? That's a challenge."
    - **Structural Ideas:** Explored a central hub (rocket ship), multiple paths, teleporters (black holes), and potentially changing level layouts per star (inspired by Mario Galaxy). A key idea adopted is having "the flipper star and all the flipper platforms are below the main course and shoot you up."
    - **Star Mechanics (Arcade Games):** Brainstormed several arcade game concepts to be adapted into 3D Mario platforming challenges.
        - **Selected:** "Tetris" (survive falling pieces to reach a star) and "Pac-Mario" (Mario navigates a maze with Chain Chomps, jumping on walls to dodge).
        - **Considered/Discarded/Reassigned:** Whack-a-Mole (too similar to existing boss), rhythm game (unsure how it would work), Skee-Ball (good, possibly for a different area/mechanic), Shell Game, Hot Rope Jump (noted for a Yoshi coin).
    - **Enemies:** Planned "Space Shy Guys" (possibly lanky, with a spin attack) and "Space Skeeters" (jumping large distances).
- **Power-ups:** The Wing Cap is considered a "great power-up for this level." Low gravity zones are also planned.
- **Player Guidance:** A recurring concern is how to guide the player without explicit cutscenes or overly linear paths. Ideas include landmarks, star descriptions, and designing paths that allow visibility of other areas.

## Business Aspects
- **Demo Release Strategy:**
    - The demo is planned for release "shortly after Christmas" (e.g., "first of next year," "By February 2025").
    - This timing is partly to avoid potential issues with Nintendo, as Kaze mentions, "if you release stuff around Christmas, Nintendo gets very angry."
    - The demo will be released on Kaze's "Case Clips channel, not on the main channel."
- **Open Sourcing:** Kaze plans to "open source it [the game/engine] once it's finished" to avoid leaking the entire game prematurely.
- **Monetization/Funding:** No direct funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island" is mentioned. Kaze does state, "I'm not playing Roblox again unless they pay me again," indicating he has done sponsored content in the past, but this is not explicitly linked to RTYI's development.

## Key Quotes
- "So, design goals We definitely want Fun, freedom This is the through line And we need a way That you're going to feel like you're an adventure into space." (Defining the core experience for Course 15).
- "How do we make it feel open despite being linear? That's a challenge. I don't have an answer for that." (Highlighting a central design obstacle).
- "Progress on the demo, the demo basically done. I'm thinking I will release it shortly after Christmas, because if you release stuff around Christmas, Nintendo gets very angry." (Detailing demo release plans and considerations).
- "The flipper star and all the flipper platforms are below the main course and shoot you up if you move around it... I think this is a great idea. It's going to add so much to the feeling free thing." (A moment of design breakthrough for level structure and player movement).

## Potential Interview Topics

- **Zeina (Animator):** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Zeina.
- **Other Contributors:** No other *new* contributors specifically for "Return to Yoshi's Island" are explicitly named and detailed in this transcript.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Concept (Astral Arcade):**
    - The level is an "arcade in space."
    - Design philosophy: "This level is gonna have a mario galaxy type design philosophy basically Feel open but be linear which we do by like having a bunch of random linear paths that somewhat intersect."
    - Layout: "We have the main area and below the main area is all the flipper pieces... all the pieces are going to be like floating around here. And they are going to be more like disconnected pieces than a whole flipper machine."
- **Gameplay Elements (Flipper Pieces):**
    - Brainstorming various types: rotating flipper, spherical bumper, triangular bumper, wormhole, speed stripes (though unsure how to implement in 3D), trampoline button.
    - 3D Constraints: "We have to keep in mind that the ones we make have to work in 3D space, so we can't do all of this [referring to some 2D pinball mechanics]."
- **Design Challenges:**
    - **Spherical Bumper Visuals/Functionality:** Kaze struggles significantly with making the spherical bumper look like it would "bump" the player and appear visually appealing: "how do we make a sphere that looks like it pushes you away when you jump into it is it even possible." He iterates through many ideas (textures, shapes, effects).
    - **Texture Issues:** "I think this looks just so jpeg artifacted how did it happen why is this so jpeg artifact it did I'm garbage with textures holy shit this just looks so bad."
    - **Adapting 2D Concepts:** Finding ways to make pinball elements work effectively and intuitively in a 3D environment.
- **Solutions/Ideas:**
    - For the spherical bumper, he eventually moves towards an idea involving a core with springs, or a half-sphere.
    - For the trampoline piece, he designs a glowing, button-like object.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization/Distribution of the Game:**
    - Kaze is aware of legal issues with selling ROM hacks: "I can't give people access because like if I did it via patreon or something I would basically be selling access to the game which would be really bad legally speaking."
- **Streaming Sponsorships:**
    - Kaze discusses and interacts with sponsor offers live on stream. Examples include:
        - "Smacking Sunflower Seeds": "They gave me free sunflower seeds... 20% commission on every sale you refer exclusive 10% discount..."
        - "Intimately" (custom sex toy company): He shares a humorous and bizarre sponsorship request email from them.
    - He jokes about doing a video with an excessive number of sponsors: "Like a whole video that's just like 15 ads in a row."

## Key Quotes
- "We're gonna be working on the Astral Arcade We now finally have a plan for the level and we can start 3D modeling." (Shows clear project progression and focus)
- "We have to keep in mind that the ones we make have to work in 3D space, so we can't do all of this." (Highlights a core design constraint and challenge)

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is in a late stage of development for its main courses.
- The current focus is on "Astro Arcade" (Course 15), which is the final main course.
- After Astro Arcade, Kaze plans to work on "three side-levels and the overworlds."
- A demo release featuring Course 1 and an updated Delfino Plaza-style overworld is planned.
- Kaze recently finished a 14-minute YouTube video, described as a "banger," related to his work.
- All necessary MPs (music/sound players?) have been imported, indicating sufficient ROM space. The ROM is stated to be "91%" complete in terms of content.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has strong opinions about his work, readily identifying elements he finds "ugly" or "cool."
- He values aesthetic appeal and player experience, often reflecting on how design choices will be perceived (e.g., "I really like how the texture here has a bunch of small stars drawn. That was even intentional. Very cool looking.").
- He shows passion for pushing technical boundaries of the N64 and sharing his discoveries (e.g., "We found a way to use an extra one megabyte in the N64. And it doesn't work on emulators.").
- He is self-critical and iterates on design based on his own judgment and playtester feedback.
- Kaze expresses a desire for his work to be high quality and impactful (e.g., "I think this is the best video on my channel yet... It goes hard.").

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):**
    - Handles sound effects and music.
    - Is the point of contact for accessing unused sound effect files ("You'd have to ask Badoop, but I'm sure he's up for it.").
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Provides concepts and graphical assets.
    - Kaze consults with Biobak on visual design elements, such as the blinking effect for a star ("You have an idea for this buyback? Something better than what I just outlined? Because then I'll just let you decide on how this should blink, and I will implement that.").
    - Kaze was waiting for Biobak's concept for platform designs for Astro Arcade.
- **Zeina (animations):**
    - (Note: While the prompt identifies Zeina for animations, this specific transcript primarily shows Zayna/Zainab as an active stream viewer and someone Kaze interacts with personally. Her specific animation contributions are not detailed in this segment, though Kaze thanks someone for "knife models" which could be animation-related, but the recipient is unclear.)

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Player Guidance:** A major focus. Beta testing for "Course 3" revealed significant issues with players getting lost or missing entire sections. Kaze plans to make initial objectives (like Star 1) much more obvious, drawing inspiration from Mario 64's level design.
    - Example: "The person just didn't notice that there was a whole level here. So that's going to be interesting to figure out how to make it more likely that people realize there's a level."
- **Level Theming and Mechanics:** Astro Arcade is a "space arcade" with pinball mechanics. Kaze is developing various interactive elements like flippers, bumpers, and trampolines.
- **Aesthetic Design:** Significant effort is put into textures, lighting, and overall visual appeal. Kaze struggles with certain elements (e.g., "metal pieces" for Astro Arcade initially looking "bad") and seeks fitting textures (e.g., arcade carpet).
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - A "Fast64 bug" related to `ss geotranslate rotate nodes` was preventing correct level export.
    - Managing N64 hardware limitations, including memory and emulator compatibility (e.g., "This game does use the expansion pack... Technically you could make this game without the expansion pack... Although you might lose emulator compatibility.").
- **Difficulty Balancing:** Ensuring levels are challenging but fair. Feedback from testers on difficult jumps in Course 3 and the accessibility of the "bit pipe."
- **Avoiding "Sonic" Comparisons:** Kaze is actively trying to prevent the "Astro Arcade" level from feeling too much like Sonic, rejecting a "ball tube" idea for this reason.
- **Iterative Design:** Kaze is willing to scrap or significantly alter ideas that don't work (e.g., the initial metal piece design). He adds elements like a "cool ring" without a definite function yet, planning to "figure out the use for it later."

## Business Aspects

So that's going to be interesting to figure out how to make it more likely that people realize there's a level." (Highlights the importance of playtesting and player guidance challenges)
- "I think the overall conclusion is the player really needs to be guided to Star 1 a lot more. I think this is something they do in Mario 64 a lot, where they make it very obvious how to get to the first star..." (Shows his design philosophy and inspiration)
- "This is going to be a space arcade. It's called Astro Arcade." (Defines the theme of the final main course)
- "With the release trailer, I want to be very careful, because I feel like Nintendo is going to try to take that down. So I really, really need to make sure it's fair use..." (Illustrates the practical concerns of releasing a high-profile ROM hack)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Evolution of Astro Arcade:** "Could you walk us through the conceptual journey of 'Astro Arcade,' from its initial ideas to the current 'space arcade' theme with pinball mechanics? What were some key inspirations or abandoned concepts?"
- **Player Onboarding and Guidance Philosophy:** "You've emphasized the challenge of player guidance, particularly after Course 3's beta test. What are your core principles for guiding players in 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' and how do you balance discovery with clarity?"

## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively working on preparing a demo for "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI), though a release date is not set. He mentions getting it "mostly released ready off stream."
- Current development focus includes programming objects and designing a specific "space area" or "arcade" level, which involves implementing features like teleportation platforms, low gravity zones, and dynamic visual effects.
- Performance optimization is a key concern, with efforts to ensure the game runs well on original N64 hardware (aiming for 20-25 FPS in demanding scenes) and targeting 60 FPS on Steam Deck for a potential PC version.
- Kaze follows an iterative development approach: outlining level concepts, programming necessary elements, experimenting with placement and mechanics to find what is "fun," and then polishing.
- A significant part of the process involves replacing original Super Mario 64 code, which Kaze deems inefficient ("dog ass"), with his own optimized versions.
- The game is built upon the Mario 64 decompilation, allowing for deep engine modifications.
- Kaze mentions having "the overworld and 2 or 5 side levels" left for the demo, with most side levels being small.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong opinion on the inefficiency of Nintendo's original SM64 code, motivating him to rewrite parts of it for better performance.
- He reflects on game difficulty, stating, "I like putting super hard things in my games... The problem with that is that a lot of the time players do encounter it... So I wanna prevent that," indicating a desire to balance challenge with player accessibility.
- Kaze is contemplating the future of his work beyond ROM hacking, including the possibility of releasing an original IP version of RTYI: "What if, along with RTYI, I also release a game that is 90% the same content, but we replace all the Nintendo IP with our own?"
- He shows pride in achieving complex technical feats on the N64, such as running demanding levels on actual hardware: "Did you think this could run on the N64?"
- Kaze discusses his preference for low-level programming when necessary but also the desire to avoid it if higher-level solutions are viable and efficient.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No direct mention or information about Badub's contributions in this transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Kaze mentions, "Considering Biobank is reworking all my stuff anyway. I should just leave it to him," specifically in the context of textures. This suggests Biobak is responsible for overhauling or finalizing the game's textures.
- **Zeina (animations/models/art):**
    - Zena created a "carpenter" model: "What do you think of this carpenter that Zena made?"
    - Zena also designed a carpet texture: "By the way, what do you think of the carpet? I made this earlier today... Your cool carpet is right here, Zeyna." (Kaze later says "I made this earlier today" referring to the carpet, but then attributes it to Zena. It seems Zena made the visual and Kaze implemented it, or there's slight confusion in the live commentary).
    - Zena is also credited with "texts" in the game: "Also loving the text. The text are good, aren't they?"
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Wiseguy:** Mentioned as someone Kaze trusts for work related to "N64 Recomp."
    - **UAD:** A past collaborator Kaze has worked with "a lot," mentioning using levels from Tonic Trouble in joint modding projects.
    - **Malon & Brodude:** Developers in the N64 community whose successful Kickstarter Kaze comments on, noting their high backer contribution average. Not direct RTYI collaborators but influences/peers.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Visual Style & Aesthetics:** Kaze is actively working on the visual style of levels, experimenting with textures (e.g., carpets, platform surfaces), lighting, and color palettes to achieve a specific "arcade-y" or "space" theme. He sometimes struggles with making elements fit, "I hate the yellow. Yellow is so fucking ugly, oh my god."
- **Level Mechanics:** Development of unique gameplay elements such as:
    - Teleportation platforms with custom animations (Mario scaling into the ground instead of using transparency).
    - Low gravity zones with distinct visual cues.
    - Dynamic lighting effects tied to platforms.
- **Technical Challenges & Bug Fixing:**
    - Dealing with rendering issues, such as a bridge not being visible or textures not displaying correctly ("Something doesn't make sense. It shouldn't be solid right now, but it is.").
    - Optimizing performance on N64 hardware, leading to decisions like disabling Mario's transparency to avoid graphical conflicts ("if I don't do this, then we have to use transparency, and I don't want to re-enable transparency on Mario's model, because it would mess with all my components").
    - Working around engine limitations and unexpected behaviors ("This is confusing because when I set the tile scroll here it worked fine.").
- **Original IP Adaptation:** A significant design consideration is how to adapt RTYI into a game with original IP, which would involve changing the main character, movement, and other Nintendo-specific elements. "Of course, I would change the movement and stuff like that too, so it would functionally be a different game."

## Business Aspects
- **Potential Commercial Release:** Kaze is seriously considering releasing a version of the game on Steam using "Recomp" (N64 Recompilation). This version would have all Nintendo IP replaced with original assets to be legally sellable. "That way we would legally own it. And I would maybe be able to use Recom to sell it on Steam or something."
- **IP and Rights:** Kaze is aware of the legal limitations of using Nintendo IP for profit. "To make a physical card, I would need the rights to Super Mario 64 first. I don't have them currently."
- **Demo Strategy:** Releasing a demo is seen as a valuable way to gather player feedback and improve the game. "Doing demos is a good way to get a lot of latest data, which is very important for making the game better."
- **Market Observation:** Kaze observes trends like Kickstarter successes in the N64 homebrew community (e.g., Malon & Brodude's project) and notes strategies like high-value backer tiers for personalized NPCs.
- **Demo Release Timing:** Kaze plans to delay the RTYI demo release to avoid clashing with another developer's (Robot's) Christmas release.

## Key Quotes
- "What if, along with RTYI, I also release a game that is 90% the same content, but we replace all the Nintendo IP with our own? That is the idea. And that way we would legally own it." (Highlights the dual-nature of the project and commercial ambitions).
- "There is some original Nintendo code left, but I am planning to replace it. Not even because I want to replace all the Nintendo code, just because the code is complete dog ass." (Shows his technical drive and rationale for deep engine changes).
- "First, I make an outline of the things I want in the level. Then I think about how I can make the level fun in the way that I envision. And then I program all the stuff that I want for that. And then I just start moving it around and see what's fun." (Explains his iterative game design philosophy).

## Game Development Process
- The "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) demo is complete but faces a booting issue on Parallel Launcher, which Kaze is working to resolve with the launcher's maintainer.
- Kaze follows a development methodology of establishing basic structures ("broadest thing") before adding details ("finest detail").
- Development is highly iterative; Kaze is willing to completely overhaul level concepts if they don't meet his vision for fun or "placeness" (e.g., scrapping the "Space Arcade" theme for a level).
- A level named "Astrologate" underwent a significant thematic redesign during the stream, evolving into "Shy Sky Station," a Shy Guy space colony.
- Performance target for console is 30 FPS.
- The game will feature a custom camera system.
- The overworld is considered a very important part of the game, aiming for an elaborate design allowing exploration of the entirety of Yoshi's Island.
- The game will include "retro areas" in each level; the one discussed will be Mario 64 themed.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly self-critical of his work, openly stating when he feels a design is "terrible" or "sucks."
- He prioritizes the "Mario 64 spirit," emphasizing core platforming fun over mini-games or mechanics that feel like a "chore" (referencing "Donkey Kong 64" negatively).
- The concept of "placeness" – making levels feel like coherent, real environments – is a crucial design goal for Kaze.
- He expresses frustration with providing one-on-one personalized help, preferring users to seek assistance in help channels.
- Kaze is not interested in Mario 64 beta recreations, finding them overdone and uninteresting.
- He actively tries to avoid directly copying elements from other games (like Mario Galaxy) while brainstorming.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (also referred to as Adobe):** Composer for the game. His music is available on SoundCloud. Kaze mentions needing to potentially pay Badub for music rights if the game is monetized.
- **Biobak (also referred to as Biomax):** Graphics artist. Credited with the idea for an animated sun effect. Kaze mentions needing to pay Biobak for his work.
- **Zeina:** (Animations) No specific contributions or interactions mentioned in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Person maintaining Parallel Launcher:** Actively working with Kaze to fix a bug preventing the RTYI demo from booting on the platform. (Name not specified).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Theme Overhaul (Astrologate/Shy Sky Station):**
    - Initial "Space Arcade" theme for a level was heavily criticized by Kaze for its aesthetics (e.g., "ugly arcade carpet," "glowing stuff") and lack of "placeness."
    - Integrating arcade machine gameplay (Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Tetris) was considered but ultimately rejected as not fun and not fitting the Mario 64 spirit.
    - The theme was changed to a "Shy Guy Space Station" (or "Shy Sky Station"), focusing on a Shy Guy civilization with retro-futuristic (1950s/60s) technology, space houses, crop plantations, and water storage.
- **Level Structure and Player Guidance:**
    - The new "Shy Sky Station" level is planned to have Star 1 involve defeating a "bioluminescent space squid" boss, which then unlocks other areas of the level.
    - The idea of using "space taxis" (looking like 1950s imagined flying cars) to guide players to different objective areas (crop plantation, water plantation) is being implemented.
    - The goal is for the player to perceive multiple objectives early on but have access gated until the initial squid boss is defeated, fostering a sense of an open yet structured world.
- **Visuals and Atmosphere:**
    - Kaze wants to avoid Mario's walking surfaces being too bright to maintain contrast and player visibility.
    - Floating TVs will feature Shy Guy "propaganda" or newscasts, potentially showing Mario attacking Shy Guys, to add to the theme.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Low gravity zones are considered good but their implementation needs refinement to feel connected to something.
    - Kaze is against implementing mini-games that feel like playing a different game (e.g., Pac-Man, Tetris as stars). Stars should primarily be about platforming.
- **Technical Considerations:**
    - Making the level feel bigger without actual large-scale expansion is a challenge. Ideas like making Mario half-size were considered and rejected due to collision and movement complications.
    - Instant warps are a possibility for transitions.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze plans to "quietly drop the demo" without a dedicated announcement video.
- He expresses a desire to potentially monetize "Return to Yoshi's Island" and use funds to pay collaborators like musicians (Badub) and artists (Biobak).
- Legal considerations for monetization, such as music rights for potential cartridge releases and consulting a copyright lawyer, are acknowledged.
- A significant financial donation (500 Euros) was received during the stream, which Kaze noted could help fund the game or pay collaborators.

## Key Quotes
- "By the way, the RTYI demo is finished now. But there is a bug in Parallel Launcher that makes my ROM not boot. I'm currently trying to fix it together with the person maintaining Parallel Launcher." (Shows progress, immediate challenge, and collaboration).
- "I think the problem is we're pushing the arcade theme too much and like no matter how we implement the arcade theme it's not gonna be fun... We made the important realization. That the idea we had for this level is terrible. And we're going to do something better." (Highlights the iterative design process and willingness to scrap ideas).
- "So I'm thinking Star 1. The big bioluminescent space squid is around and everyone's scared... And you have to climb through the level to the space squid. Kill it. And then everything else in the level unlocks." (Illustrates the new creative direction and structural thinking for a level).

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Iterative Design of "Shy Sky Station":** Explore the journey from the "Space Arcade" concept to the "Shy Guy Space Station," detailing the specific creative and gameplay concerns that prompted such a significant overhaul and the key inspirations for the new direction.
- **Achieving "Placeness" and the "Mario 64 Spirit":** Discuss Kaze's philosophy on these core design principles. How does he define them, and what specific techniques or design choices in RTYI exemplify this, particularly in unique level themes?
- **Collaboration and Monetization in ROM Hacking:** Delve into the dynamics of working with collaborators like Badub and Biobak on a passion project. Explore Kaze's thoughts on the potential for monetizing a ROM hack, the associated challenges (e.g., legal, community perception), and his vision for supporting the project and its contributors financially.
- **The Role of the Overworld in RTYI:** Kaze mentioned the overworld is "the most important part of the game." Expand on his vision for the RTYI overworld, how it aims to innovate or improve upon other Mario 64 experiences, and the challenges in creating such an ambitious explorable space.
- **Technical Challenges and Solutions:** Discuss some of the key technical hurdles faced during RTYI's development (e.g., performance optimization for console, Parallel Launcher compatibility, level size limitations) and the problem-solving approaches taken.

## Game Development Process
- A second demo for "Return to Yoshi's Island" was released on the day of the stream. This demo features only "course one" (the first level).
- Kaze plans to upload a full playthrough of the demo the following day.
- The specific level being worked on during the stream has undergone significant changes since previously shown and currently has no name.
- The level's theme is "retrofuturism," envisioned as a space colony from a 1960s perspective.
- Development includes iterating on level layout (e.g., making a gap smaller, designing a climbable rocket, incorporating monorails) and boss mechanics.
- Technical troubleshooting is ongoing, such as an issue where the game doesn't boot on an EverDrive X7, leading to experiments like invalidating RAM before boot.
- An experiment was conducted to run code directly from the cartridge instead of RAM to potentially reduce RDP time, but it was unsuccessful.
- Performance optimization is a concern, with efforts to manage polygon counts and detail while ensuring smooth gameplay.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong skepticism about traditional color theory, stating, "Dude, fuck color theory. I hate, I don't like color theory. I don't think color theory is real. I think it's all bullshit." He clarifies he "learned about colors," not color theory.
- He reflects on the player experience of new mechanics, such as the "Mars Movement Camera Control," noting that some players take time to adjust but then enjoy it.
- Kaze prefers "implicit storytelling" over explicit lore dumps.
- He discusses the design philosophy behind certain moves, like making a spin attack a "safety move" that players should feel "ashamed for" using, discouraging overuse.
- He is conscious of over-referencing other games like Sonic Adventure 2, fearing it might make his work seem unoriginal.
- He has a pragmatic approach to development timelines: "It is done when it is done."
- Kaze mentions his surprise at the amount of interest in the demo: "I'm surprised how many people wanted to play the demo. I didn't think people were really interested in the demo that much."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript regarding contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Biobak: While "Biobak" isn't directly named, Kaze mentions a "Biomec" in chat, stating, "I'm sure Biomec can find a better texture for what I'm trying to convey in here. Send it to me." This suggests a collaborator he relies on for texture work, potentially Biobak.
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript regarding contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Other Contributors:
    - **Esa:** Collaborated on a previous version of a level, referred to as "the slide basically," which has since been completely changed.
    - **Fasana:** Is working on an "octopus alien monster" boss, which Kaze plans to include eventually.
    - **Aza:** Kaze asks Aza about progress on a "SimpleFlips entry thing" and mentions a "stupid shitpost" collaboration with Aza and Doriel.
    - **Doriel:** Mentioned as a collaborator with Aza on a "stupid shitpost."
    - **Anonymous Twitter User:** Sent Kaze concept art for rounded edges on an asset, which Kaze intends to use.
    - **SimpleFlips:** Kaze mentions a "SimpleFlips hack" and concerns about music copyright affecting SimpleFlips' bot if certain OSTs are used.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Theme & Aesthetics:** The current level is themed around "retrofuturism," specifically a 1960s vision of a space colony, with elements like monorails and a distinct visual style. There's a desire to avoid overly rusty appearances as "things shouldn't rust" in space, despite Kaze initially liking a rusty look.
- **Boss Design (Iterative Process):**
    - Initial idea: "The Blob," a gelatinous mass with a brain, fitting the retro sci-fi theme.
    - Second idea (from viewer suggestion): "Sluggy the Unshaven" from Yoshi's Island.
    - Third idea (developed during stream): A squid-like boss attacked via rifts/black holes, with tentacles. The player would damage it by hitting its eyes when it pokes its head out after shooting lasers. Dynamic lighting from rifts would signal attack origins.
- **Movement Mechanics:**
    - The "Z plus A move" was removed because it was "so strong that like that basically wasn't a game anymore."
    - Spin and ground pound dive attacks were restricted ("you can only spin or ground pound dive at any time") because unrestricted movement was "too broken." Momentum is removed from a spin move to make it a "safety move."
- **Platforming Elements:**
    - Designing a climbable rocket involves figuring out platforming paths and potentially incorporating monorails around it.
    - An idea for a "trampoline" evolved from a jarring bouncy platform to a "shockwave that shoots you upwards whenever you land on it," possibly themed as a speaker.
- **Technical Challenges & Solutions:**
    - The game not booting on EverDrive X7 is a significant issue Kaze is actively trying to solve.
    - Balancing visual detail with N64 performance limitations is a constant consideration ("Speed gains are mostly spent on like more polygons and details... we need the performance gains here").
    - An attempt to improve performance by running code from the cartridge failed.
- **Player Guidance:** For the squid boss, Kaze considers how to make the weak point obvious, suggesting red pulsating eyes after a laser attack. Using dynamic lights from rifts to indicate attack direction is also a way to guide the player.

## Business Aspects
- **Demo Release Strategy:** A second demo (course one only) was released to gather feedback and generate interest. A full playthrough video of the demo is planned for release the next day as a promotional tool.
- **Patching/Distribution:** Kaze states the game "will be very easy to patch."
- **Copyright Considerations:** Kaze expresses awareness of music copyright issues, particularly in the context of a separate "SimpleFlips hack" project, where copyrighted music could lead to demonetization and affect SimpleFlips' bot. This indicates a general awareness of such issues.
- No direct mentions of funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island."

## Key Quotes
- "This level has changed a lot since stream last saw it. It's extremely different now. ... It is done when it is done."
- "Dude, fuck color theory. I hate, I don't like color theory. I don't think color theory is real. I think it's all bullshit."
- "Alright, fuck it. Instead of the blob, it's Sluggy the Unshaven. Good call. ... Oh shit, you're right. Like black holes opening and tentacles coming out... I think that works. Now there's one figured out."

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore Kaze's overall vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island" and how the "retrofuturism" theme ties into the Yoshi's Island inspiration.
- Discuss his philosophy on game design, particularly his approach to difficulty, player agency, and iterating on mechanics based on feel versus predefined rules (like color theory).
- Delve deeper into the collaborative process, especially with contributors like Fasana on future content and how community suggestions (like the Sluggy boss idea) influence development.
- Ask about the biggest technical hurdles in pushing the Mario 64 engine for this hack and how he approaches problem-solving for issues like performance or hardware compatibility (e.g., EverDrive).
- Inquire about his decision-making process when balancing artistic vision with player feedback and N64 limitations, especially regarding level design and boss encounters.

*Extracted on: 20250112*

## Game Development Process
- Current focus is on Course 15, specifically the factory level and its boss fight.
- The boss fight conceptualization and mechanics are actively being designed and iterated upon.
- A previous demo was released primarily to gather feedback on Mario's physics and camera controls.
- Development involves iterative design, where ideas are discussed, implemented, and refined (e.g., boss mechanics changing from destructive to healing).
- Kaze is actively working on level geometry, texturing, lighting, and enemy design for this course.
- There's an ongoing effort to balance visual detail with the N64's technical limitations and performance targets (e.g., 30 FPS).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly self-critical of his own work and often seeks inspiration from other developers (e.g., "Dario").
- He expresses a strong passion for N64 development and its unique constraints, preferring it over modern platforms like the PC port for his own projects.
- He voices frustration with community pressure regarding the PC port of Mario 64, stating he avoids it partly out of "pure stubbornness" due to how insistent people have been.
- Kaze shows vulnerability regarding the growing audience on his "second channel," feeling it's becoming too public for its intended informal nature.
- He values creative freedom and making a "cool N64 game" above potential monetary gain.
- He reflects on the difficulty of achieving certain visual effects (like good reflections) on the N64.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific mention of Badub's contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):**
    - Actively collaborates with Kaze on the boss fight concept for Course 15 ("me and biobank we have been talking about a little bit the boss fight").
    - Provides visual ideas and drawings for the boss ("biobank did draw something here but he sent me this idea here").
- **Zeina (animations):** No specific mention of Zeina's contributions in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Dario:** A fellow developer whose visual work Kaze admires and uses as a benchmark or inspiration ("Dario made such a nice version of this").
    - **"asa" (chat member):** Provided a texture that Kaze implemented and liked for a building ("asa's texture actually made it look good").
    - **Alox:** Mentioned in relation to a potential co-op project ("X-Corp") and the PC port; Kaze directs inquiries about X-Corp to Alox.
    - **Rome_leader / Romeo King:** Mentioned as a potential source for 3D assets ("you can get them from romeo king and conglomerate that should be pretty safe").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boss Design (Mutated Yoshi):**
    - Initial ideas included a tentacle monster, then a mutated Yoshi with multiple tongues.
    - The concept evolved into a "heal the boss" mechanic: the Yoshi is mutated (cancerous growths/tumors), and the player destroys these tumors to cure it. This aligns with Yoshis being friendly and Sky Guys (local inhabitants) being the antagonists.
    - The boss will have attacks like ground pounds creating shockwaves, a tongue attack (licking/eating Mario), rolling into a ball, teleporting via black holes, and spitting acid puddles.
    - Baby Yoshis in the level will also have growths that the player can destroy, teaching the mechanic and having them react positively.
- **Visuals & Technical Limitations:**
    - Struggling to create convincing reflective surfaces without using N-Gons or mipmaps, due to N64 texture and combiner limitations.
    - Balancing detailed textures with performance and avoiding repetitiveness (e.g., i4 vs. i8 texture formats, color banding).
    - Ensuring platforming elements remain clear and playable despite visual details (e.g., judging slope angles).
- **Level & Arena Design (Course 15 Factory):**
    - Designing the boss arena with a hexagon-like pattern for movement and engagement.
    - Implementing lighting and atmospheric effects to enhance the factory setting.
    - The lore involves "Sky Guys" (not Shy Guys) who are scared of the mutated Yoshi boss.
- **Demo Strategy:** The demo was intentionally limited to Course 1-1 to focus feedback on core mechanics (physics, camera) and avoid revealing too much content.
- **Power-ups:** The game will feature power-ups like the Ice Cap, Wing Cap, Cloud Cap, and Bomb Cap. The Metal Cap is excluded due to Kaze's dislike of its "key-like" function.

## Business Aspects
- No direct mention of funding.
- The release of a demo served to gather feedback, which can indirectly act as community engagement/marketing.
- Kaze acknowledges that using the PC port might be financially beneficial ("I would probably make a good amount of money if I used the PC part for my stuff") but states his primary motivation is creative, not monetary ("I just want to make a cool N64 game").
- He is aware of his audience size and expresses some concern about his "second channel" becoming too popular for its informal nature.

## Key Quotes
- "The boss fight is basically the thing we have to like do next or plan out next so that's why the factory is there." (Shows current development focus)
- "But instead of killing the Yoshi you heal it oh, it's an interesting idea... yeah, actually that makes a lot more sense cuz like the sky guys are like the enemies, right So obviously you wouldn't want to help them and the Yoshi's are your friends... I think we'll do that." (Highlights a key design shift and rationale)
- "People have been so insistent and annoying about the PC port. That at this point, out of pure stubbornness, I want nothing to do with it... I just want to make a cool N64 game." (Explains his stance on the PC port and his primary motivation)
- "I'm trying to make this look somewhat reflective without actually using an nth map because if i use an nth map i can't use a texture and if i can't use a texture then there's no detail and looks like shit that's what i'm trying to do." (Illustrates the technical problem-solving process)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore the collaborative process with Biobak in designing the mutated Yoshi boss, from initial concepts to the "healing" mechanic. How are creative differences navigated?
- Discuss Kaze's philosophy on working within the N64's limitations. How do these constraints fuel creativity versus creating frustration, particularly in achieving desired visual styles?
- Delve into the decision to create a pacifistic boss resolution (healing Yoshi). How does this tie into the broader themes and narrative of "Return to Yoshi's Island"?
- Kaze's relationship with the ROM hacking community: How does he balance leveraging its positive aspects (feedback, shared resources, inspiration) with managing pressure and maintaining his artistic vision?
- What are Kaze's ultimate aspirations for "Return to Yoshi's Island"? What experience does he hope to deliver to players, and what does this project personally mean to him as a creator?

*Extracted on: 20250115*

## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** Earlier levels are "most of everything is done," though some pending tasks remain. Active development is focused on specific levels, such as a "space city" area and a snow level.
- **Development Stages & Workflow:**
    - Platforming mechanics are implemented first for new areas (e.g., "platforming for the first star done" in one section).
    - Visual polish follows the core mechanics.
    - Iterative design is common, with experimentation on visual elements (lighting, model shapes, effects).
    - Specific features like a "space taxi" and a "gramophone-shaped concert hall" are being designed and implemented for the space city.
    - Story elements are integrated into level progression (e.g., Shy Guy behavior changing after a boss, unlocking new areas).
- **Current Focus (during stream):**
    - Designing and modeling elements for a space-themed level (concert hall, walkway, space taxi).
    - Working on lighting solutions and effects (e.g., floor-mounted lights, pulsating floor lights, fake reflections).
    - Discussing character models (Peach, Toad, Luigi, Yoshi boss) and their implementation.
    - Fixing bugs and refining existing level geometry (e.g., making a platforming section easier).
    - A crash occurred during the stream, leading to some loss of progress.

## Personal Insights
- **On Perception of His Work:** Kaze expresses frustration when his work's impressiveness is qualified by "he has no budget and he works alone," feeling it might diminish the achievement.
- **Creative Control & Project Integrity:** He has very strong opinions about how his projects are handled, exemplified by his staunch opposition to an unauthorized PC port of "Return to Yoshi's Island." He states, "If I had the ability to just like slip my fingers and the PC port would be out of existence, I would do it."
- **Pride in Technical Skill:** Kaze is confident in his technical abilities, particularly regarding the N64's rendering engine which he wrote/modified extensively ("It's pretty easy for me to do it because I wrote the rendering engine basically.").
- **Development Philosophy:** He values an iterative approach, trying out ideas and refining them. He also mentions working as efficiently as possible.
- **Relationship with Hating/Criticism:** "I like hating on things, but I don't like if other people join me and hating on those things. Because then I feel like a bully."
- **On his YouTube Content:** He notes his videos have become more like "computer science lectures in disguise" and wishes they were more approachable, hoping the upcoming shader video will be.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:**
    - Role: Composer.
    - Contribution: Responsible for the game's music. Kaze states, "Yeah Badoob is doing the music. I can't do music at all."
- **Biobak:**
    - Role: Graphics artist/Model polisher.
    - Contribution: "Biobank goes over my models. After I'm done. And polishes them up. Brings a lot of ideas. And new concepts to the table." Helps refine the visual quality of Kaze's 3D models. Mentioned as someone who will "bail me out" if Kaze's initial model work is rough.
- **Zeina (referred to as "Say not" or "you" in chat during relevant segments):**
    - Role: Art and Animations.
    - Contribution: Provided the idea/drawing for a "mutant Yoshi" boss. Created the Peach and Toad models for a snow level. Kaze mentions, "I think you also wanted to do the animation so I left that for you" regarding the Peach model.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Dory:** Kaze discusses a collaborative project (referred to as "our compact" or "our computer") where Dory handles the majority of the work (~70%), including graphics updates, new combiners, UV mapping, and programming. This appears to be a separate project from "Return to Yoshi's Island."
    - **Kaze's Video Editor:** Mentioned in the context of YouTube finances ("I had to pay my editor like $500"). Not a direct RTYI game contributor but supports Kaze's content creation.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Level Themes & Features:**
    - Space City Level: Designing a concert hall (potentially gramophone-shaped), a space taxi system for traversal, and unique walkways (e.g., glowing floor tiles).
    - Story-driven Progression: Shy Guys' behavior changes post-boss, unlocking new areas and transportation (flying cars).
- **Visual & Technical Challenges:**
    - Lighting: Experimenting with lamp placement to avoid clipping and achieve desired effects (e.g., floor-mounted lights shining upwards). Creating pulsating light effects on floors that also illuminate Mario.
    - Reflections: Implementing a "fake reflection" effect for stars on a wall due to N64 limitations ("We obviously do not have the computing power. To actually reflect the stars.").
    - Model Detail vs. Performance: Designing assets like the gramophone to be "fairly low poly" and fit the "spacey aesthetic."
- **Gameplay & Difficulty:**
    - Adjusting platforming sections to make them less difficult or more intuitive ("I need to make this easier.").
    - Managing camera controls: Kaze notes conflicting requests from players and believes the current system is "as good as it could possibly be" without a complete redesign.
- **Specific Asset Design:**
    - Flying cars for Shy Guys: Iterating on the design to make it look futuristic and car-like, while managing polycount.
    - Gramophone concert hall: Brainstorming and modeling a low-poly, space-themed gramophone structure.

## Business Aspects
- **Funding:**
    - Primary income for SM64 hacking comes from Patreon: "Patreon. That's the majority of my income. From bar 64 hacking."
    - Supplemental income from YouTube: His channel made $940 in a recent period, with $500 going to his video editor. He considers this "kinda like a side job."
- **Release/Distribution:**
    - No explicit release plans for RTYI mentioned, but strong opposition to a community-led PC port suggests he intends to control its release, likely as a traditional ROM hack.
    - He mentions if he had *his own* game to release on Steam, he probably would, distinguishing this from a fan-made port of his ROM hack.
- **Marketing:**
    - No direct marketing plans discussed for RTYI. His YouTube streams and videos serve as ongoing public showcases of development.
    - A joking remark about marketing a "moon game" ("we will turn this into Not Mario 64 and market the moon game I guess") seems unrelated to RTYI.

## Key Quotes
- "I'm trying to like get all the platforming done and then afterwards maybe polish up the visuals a little bit." (Illustrates development workflow)
- "Biobank goes over my models. After I'm done. And polishes them up. Brings a lot of ideas. And new concepts to the table." (Highlights collaborative visual refinement)
- "Personally, I am not doing shit. I have nothing to do with the PC port. I want nothing to do with the PC port. If I had the ability to just like slip my fingers and the PC port would be out of existence, I would do it." (Emphasizes strong stance on project integrity and distribution)

## Game Development Process
- Currently working on a specific level section ("Space Taxi," potentially Course 15), focusing on platforming, level flow, and connecting areas to a "black hole."
- Actively creating and importing new 3D assets (flying car, antenna concepts, gramophone, piano key staircase, retro-futuristic CRTs, flying parking lot).
- Continuous optimization is a major focus, particularly reducing triangle counts for N64 hardware performance.
- Significant time spent on bug fixing, including crashes on actual N64 hardware and collision issues.
- The hub world ("all of Yoshi's Island") is a critical component planned for later in development, considered "by far the most important part of the game."
- Iterative design process: Kaze frequently tests, evaluates, and modifies level elements and models based on feel and playability.
- Kaze mentions working on "his longest video yet" and another video about "every shader in Mario 64," indicating ongoing content creation alongside game development.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze finds some aspects of his work, like extensive video editing, "so much work and so exhausting."
- He holds strong opinions on game design, e.g., believing the hub world was "the only reason Mario 64 was famous, popular."
- He is candid about his public persona and acknowledges reasons why people might not like him personally, separating that from appreciation of his work.
- Kaze values deep work and focus, mentioning he intentionally had a "loneliest possible college experience" to dedicate time to working.
- He expresses skepticism towards some new technologies (e.g., Switch 2, Windows 11) and often prefers proven or simpler solutions.
- He reflects on the difficulty of onboarding collaborators unfamiliar with N64 development constraints, noting it can cost more time than it saves.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No specific mention of Badub's direct involvement in "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist/Level Design):**
    - Kaze discussed a "Yoshi boss idea" with Biobak, agreeing with Biobak's feedback about it being "a little cryptic" and considering Biobak's alternative ideas. The boss concept involves attacking tumors inside its mouth.
    - Biobak is currently "working on course 2," and Kaze plans to do an analysis of courses before Biobak reworks them.
- **Zeina (Animations/Art):**
    - Referred to as "Zayna my wife."
    - Kaze mentions, "Zayna already drew something for them [shy guys NPCs]," indicating her contribution of art assets.
    - Implied she handles other assets: "Zayn. I'm so long bio backups with that I already have a lot of with it" (potentially meaning backups of her work).
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Bruno Gadsen:** Sent Kaze a 3D model design for a retro-futuristic CRT which Kaze liked and decided to implement.
    - **"GBA port guy":** Collaborating with Kaze on a separate video project; this person has recorded voice lines and footage.
    - **Sauron:** Mentioned in the context of the Fast64 Discord server, providing accurate estimates on cycle savings for optimizations.
    - **Dodongo:** Mentioned as working on Lib Dragon, whose work Kaze says he "can't really use" for this project.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Platforming Design:** Kaze frequently iterates on platforming sections to ensure they are not "too awkward" or unfairly difficult, aiming for a good player experience.
- **N64 Technical Constraints:** A recurring challenge is balancing visual complexity and desired features with N64 hardware limitations (e.g., "this area is already very complex. And it's going to lag if we keep adding too much stuff to it"). This forces simplification and careful optimization (e.g., reducing triangle counts for models).
- **Asset Creation:** Designing assets that are both aesthetically pleasing (e.g., "retrofuturism") and low-poly enough for the N64 (e.g., modeling the CRT).
- **Collision and Bugs:** Dealing with collision system limits ("too many collision triangles") and debugging crashes that occur on real hardware but not always in emulators.
- **Onboarding Collaborators:** Difficulty in finding artists who understand N64-specific development, particularly shaders, which can lead to Kaze spending excessive time teaching them.
- **Hub World Significance:** The decision to make the hub world extensive and full of secrets, and to develop it last because of its perceived importance in tying the game together.
- **Player Movement:** Kaze mentions player feedback led to changes in the dive mechanic (allowing direction change but with speed loss), showing responsiveness to player experience.
- **Communicating Game Mechanics:** Thinking about how to communicate things like an impending "barrel roll" to the player.

## Business Aspects
- **Potential Steam Release:** Kaze is considering releasing the game on Steam, which would involve "replac[ing] all Nintendo assets and would kick out the last bit of Nintendo code." This indicates a plan for a version of the game independent of Nintendo IP.
- **Kickstarter Aversion:** He is "scared of using Kickstarter" due to not understanding sales tax laws and fearing financial complications.
- **Collaboration Model:** Kaze is generally not looking to pay for creative contributions for this project ("Pay me money and I'll make characters for you, then it's probably a no") but is open to free help ("if it's like oh I want to help you make the game so I'm offering my work for free then it's probably yes").
- **Content Creation for Algorithm:** He mentions creating a long video and hoping "the algorithm will bless this video," showing awareness of YouTube's platform dynamics for visibility.
- **Monetization of Past Work:** He mentions making an N64 game last year "because I was paid to do it," but doubts he'll be paid to do another, distinct from RTYI.

## Key Quotes
- "I was thinking maybe using the static recompilation to release this game both like as an n64 game with Mario and Officially as like a game on Steam... Obviously, I would replace all Nintendo assets and would kick out the last bit of Nintendo code as well." (Highlights future commercial ambitions and IP considerations).
- "The hub world is by far the most important part of the game. And you need to make sure it's perfect... The hub world is I think the only reason Mario 64 was famous, popular." (Emphasizes his design philosophy and the importance of a key game feature).
- "One problem I see with your friend helping is that he probably doesn't understand how n64 shaders work... I'm a little worried. I'm gonna have to spend so much time teaching him that he ends up costing more time than he saves, you know." (Illustrates a key challenge in collaborating on N64 projects).

## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively developing a "space level" or "Cosmic Colony" (also referred to as a "plantation" or "space greenhouse"), focusing on platforming mechanics, visual polish (textures, glow effects, signs), and level layout.
- The development process is iterative: core platforming is established first, and then aesthetic elements and narrative justifications are built around it ("Really what we're doing now is we already made the platforming, and now we're just trying to justify the platforms we've made.")
- There's an expectation of a later "debug" phase where much of the current work will be reworked or refined.
- Story development is secondary to gameplay in the initial stages: "We haven't really planned the story yet. I think it's better to just put together some gameplay first, and then plan the story around the gameplay you have."
- Performance on actual N64 hardware is a consideration, with Kaze testing builds on console and noting FPS ("43 FPS. Ooh, it doesn't like all these plants here.")
- Work involves using tools like Fast64 (a Blender add-on).
- Specific features being implemented/refined include:
    - Bumpers for movement.
    - Low-poly crops.
    - Signs for guidance.
    - Glowing outlines for platform visibility.
    - Skybox implementation.
    - Star collection animations (blinking).
    - Textures for various surfaces (platforms, water tanks).

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong desire for ROM hacks, including "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI), to be recognized as legitimate games capable of standing on their own, independent of the original Mario 64 context. ("I feel like right now, people don't respect RomEx as like real games... I definitely want to change that.")
- He believes gameplay should precede story development in Mario games.
- Kaze values player freedom in game design ("For me, gaming is all about freedom.").
- He is candid about his motivations, including financial ones for intensive work periods.
- He shares personal anecdotes (e.g., his dislike for Mario Tennis) and opinions on various topics like anime, operating systems, and AI, offering a glimpse into his personality beyond game development.

- **Level "Feel" / "Sauce":** Kaze strives to make levels feel good to play, referring to a "sauce" that a level might initially lack but gains through iteration.
- **Technical Bugs:** Encountering and addressing game crashes, such as one related to Backward Long Jumps (BLJs): "My fucking game crashed. ... It's clearly something in the PLJ code itself causing an infinite loop somewhere." He later seems to fix it or understand it better.
- **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring the game runs well on N64 hardware, especially with many objects on screen ("Ooh, it doesn't like all these plants here. 43 FPS.").
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Designing jump sequences and platforming challenges that are fun and not "jank."
    - Considering speedrun strategies and how they impact level design. ("I want to see what the speedrun strat would be like.")
    - Deciding whether to support or fix unintended mechanics like BLJs.
- **Aesthetics and Theming:** Making choices about textures, color palettes, and object design to fit the "space plantation" theme (e.g., designing "low-poly crops," water tanks).
- **Player Guidance:** Using elements like signs ("We also have these signs now that just point to the factory") to improve navigation.
- **Iterative Design:** Constantly tweaking elements based on testing and feedback (e.g., platform placement, texture choices, effect intensity).

## Business Aspects
- **Open Source Release:** Kaze states, "I'm planning to open source this game anyway, so there's little point in leaking it." This is a significant decision regarding the game's distribution and future.
- **Monetization (Hypothetical):** Kaze discusses a hypothetical stream idea where donations would extend development time for a new hack ("for every $1,000 of every $500 donated, we add an extra day of stream... I think that could be the money idea."). He clarifies this would be for his "bank account," not charity. This is not explicitly for RTYI but shows his thinking on funding development.
- **Views on ROM Hacking and Commercial Viability:** Discussion about whether a game heavily inspired by Mario 64 could be sold legally, prompted by looking at "Kero Quest." Kaze notes he's "not even planning to do that" (sell RTYI).

## Key Quotes
- "I feel like right now, people don't respect RomEx as like real games. Even RomEx don't seem to do that. So I definitely want to change that. I want to make sure that this RomEx is also like playable as like a normal game without the context of Mario 64." (Reflects his ambition for the project and ROM hacks in general).
- "Really what we're doing now is we already made the platforming, and now we're just trying to justify the platforms we've made." (Illustrates his iterative, gameplay-first design philosophy).
- "We haven't really planned the story yet. I think it's better to just put together some gameplay first, and then plan the story around the gameplay you have. Because it's a Mario game." (Explains his approach to narrative design within the context of a Mario game).

## Game Development Process
- The game, "Return to Yoshi's Island," is actively being developed, with a focus on creating complex boss fights and refining level details.
- There are 15 main courses planned, with approximately 9 of them featuring boss fights.
- Kaze is currently working on the boss for Course 15, a "Yoshi Pentapus." This involves designing its appearance (initially a "floating hat with some tumors," evolving into a tentacled creature), programming its attack patterns (tentacles from black holes, destroying "wards" or tumors), and implementing hitboxes and visual effects.
- Specific courses like Course 13 and Course 14 are described as "95% done," with Course 13 needing outside area work by Zeno and Course 14 awaiting more visuals from Violet.
- The development process is iterative, involving frequent testing, debugging, and refinement of mechanics and visuals (e.g., adjusting tentacle size, speed, lighting effects, collision).
- Kaze mentions a plan for "six side levels which would include the four cab levels but nowadays there's a good chance that it's actually going to be like nine side levels."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar is highly opinionated about game design, valuing precision and polish, and expressing frustration with "jank" or bugs in games.
- He consciously maintains a politically neutral public persona to appeal to a broader audience, citing the "halo effect."
- He has a playful side, referencing past pranks like hiding large "cock" models in his old ROM hacks, visible only through hacking tools.
- Kaze values clear communication and expresses a desire for precision in language, which may reflect in his coding and design philosophy.
- He is candid about his development process, including mistakes and ongoing problem-solving, and interacts extensively with his chat, though he humorously dislikes repetitive questions like "how are you doing?"

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Badoop):** Implied to be the game's composer. Kaze refers to him as "royalty" and "famous" when a chatter mentions knowing about something potentially related to Badub's work (possibly music).
- **Biobak (Biowake):** A graphics artist responsible for remaking/refining 3D models. Kaze states, "The textures on the boss are not final, though. They're more like a symbolic representation of what I want this to look like, so that when Biowake remakes my model, he knows what I was going for."
- **Zeina:** No specific contribution to "Return to Yoshi's Island" animations is mentioned in this transcript. Kaze discusses his own past work implementing a rideable Yoshi in 2013.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Akumoid:** Collaborated with Kaze on creating advanced N64 shaders, specifically a reflection shader for buildings that Kaze is very pleased with. Akumoid was also working on shaders for a rocket model.
    - **Zeno:** Mentioned as working on the "outside area" for Course 13 for a long time.
    - **Violet:** Tasked with completing visuals for Course 14 to make it look "as pretty as it should be."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boss Design (Yoshi Pentapus):**
    - Concept: Evolved from a "Yoshi Kraken" to a "Yoshi Pentapus" (a five-tentacled creature) for uniqueness. The boss is a corrupted Yoshi that the player helps by destroying "tumors" or "wards."
    - Mechanics: Attacks with tentacles emerging from black/blue holes. Players must destroy "wards" on the tentacles, then attack exposed wards on Yoshi's nose to deal damage. The fight loop involves repeating this process.
    - Visuals: Placeholder model ("floating hat with tumors") used during development, with the final model to be done by Biobak/Biowake. Kaze is iterating on tentacle animations, black hole effects, and lighting cues for attacks.
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - Implementing tentacle hitboxes using "spline hitboxes."
    - Debugging rendering issues (e.g., texture problems, objects rotating incorrectly, material batching).
    - Creating effective visual cues for players (e.g., lights from portals to indicate attack origins).
    - Ensuring dynamic collision for tentacles works correctly and doesn't trap the player.
- **Easter Eggs:** Kaze plans to include "cryptographic messages" and other easter eggs that may require looking at the game's code to discover, adding a layer of mystery.
- **Level Structure:** 15 main courses, with 9 boss fights. Plans for 6-9 side levels.
- **Player Experience:** Kaze considers player fairness, such as making tentacles retract instantly upon hitting Mario to prevent getting stuck, even if it seems punishing. He also works on visual clarity for attack warnings.

## Business Aspects
- **Distribution/Accessibility:** Kaze mentions the possibility of using "YSK static recompilation to properly import the game to like everything at once. So you wouldn't even need an emulator." This suggests an interest in broader accessibility beyond traditional ROM hack emulation.
- **Community Ports:** Kaze expresses frustration with the quality of unofficial ports of his hacks to platforms like Co-op Deluxe, stating his general policy is to allow such ports if they don't require his help, but he gets annoyed if asked for assistance, especially if the porting effort is poor.
- No direct mentions of marketing budgets, sales, or traditional funding were found. The focus is on creation and potential accessibility.

## Key Quotes
- "So the boss is gonna be a Yoshi Kraken, but he doesn't look like a Kraken right now. He just looks like a floating hat with some tumors grown on it. And you destroy the tumors to beat him... Yes, this is the Yoshi. That's not a Kraken. It's a pentapose." (Illustrates creative evolution and core boss concept)
- "The loop is basically, Yoshi is like floating around here at the start... he starts attacking you... tentacles come and attack and the tentacles have these wards on them... you jump on his tentacle, you destroy the ward and then Yoshi gets weak... on his nose, there's more wards... you punch the ward and that's dealing damage to him. He shakes you off and then you repeat that three times." (Details a complex boss fight structure)
- "So the last few days, a person called Akumoid has been DMing with me. They wanted to learn about N64 shaders and they wanted to help me make a good shader for this. And together we came up with this one here... I'm very happy with this." (Highlights successful collaboration and technical innovation)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore the origin and core vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island." How does it connect to or depart from the original Yoshi's Island and SM64?

## Game Development Process
- **Current Stage:** Nearing completion of all main courses, with Course 15 being the final one actively under development during the stream. Kaze mentions, "all the main courses will be finished. That will feel so good."
- **Next Phases:** Post-main course completion, the project will move into "polishing content," followed by extensive beta testing, fixing old levels, and then developing the overworld and side levels.
- **Specific Progress:**
    - Course 15 boss fight mechanics and visuals are being finalized and debugged.
    - The "inside of the rocket" sub-area in Course 15 is being detailed, including a multi-room spaceship layout (computer room, specimen room, engine room, observatory).
    - A "retro section" for Course 15, themed after Super Mario 64, is being planned, involving combining iconic elements from multiple SM64 levels.
- **Iterative Nature:** Development involves significant iteration, bug fixing (e.g., smoke effects, enemy spawning, BLJ crashes), and refinement of existing content. Kaze notes, "This is what happens when you keep changing the engine, all the levels just break," highlighting ongoing technical adjustments.
- **ROM Size:** The game is currently 58.8 MB, with Kaze aiming to keep it within a 64MB N64 cartridge limit, stating, "It does fit on a 64 megabyte cartridge. I'm making up my limits."

## Personal Insights
- **Design Philosophy:** Kaze has a clear vision for player experience, emphasizing "edging the player" by teasing rewards and creating anticipation. He strongly opposes adding excessive options, believing it clutters the game: "There's one thing where I will consistently disagree with the people asking for stuff and that is options... if I added everyone's request for options, I would have an option menu with 260 items and it would be shit."
- **Reflection on Work:** He acknowledges the demanding nature of the project and sometimes marvels at his own productivity: "Dude, it feels like I did so much stuff since the last time I streamed. How how was I so productive?"
- **Community Interaction:** Kaze actively engages with his chat for feedback and ideas ("What do you think?") but ultimately maintains creative control. He's candid about the limitations of feedback, especially in later stages: "a lot of the feedback I'm getting now is like either super nitpicky or contradicting another feedback I got."
- **Openness and Boundaries:** He has a clear policy on sharing his work: "If you are able to use my stuff without my help, then you're free to use it."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No specific current contributions to RTYI mentioned in this transcript. Kaze mentions "The first track there is always really fun custom music" generally, and discusses composers for a different game (Last Impact).
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - Responsible for 3D models and graphics, including the main boss model ("I purposefully did not fully import it yet because I figured Biobank had changes to it").
    - Provides feedback on visual elements, such as UV mapping issues in the spaceship level ("There's cogs here, but you cannot see the cogs because the UV mapping is sucky as Biobank said").
- **Zeina (Animator):**
    - Works on animations for game elements, such as the "baby Yoshis" in the Course 15 boss fight ("Zayna's currently animating them. So hopefully they will be better once they are animated.").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Hazer:** Guest author working on a "little side level," described as "sliding on wind and there's flowers everywhere. It's very pastel colored."
    - **Martiste:** Guest author for "a few of the levels."
    - **Azawaza:** Designed a level shown on stream, noted for its "very pastel color, very Yoshi's Island" aesthetic. Kaze mentions, "This is what he's planned for this game."
    - **Unnamed individual:** Contracted to create YouTube shorts for Kaze's channel for $5 per short.
    - **HooliKaleb (Community Member):** Offered to convert .skp files (SketchUp models of SM64 levels) to .obj for Kaze to use in the retro section.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Boss Design Iteration (Course 15):**
    - Initial concept for the mutated Yoshi boss involved "tumors," which was changed to "mushrooms" after feedback that tumors were "way too disgusting."
    - The boss arena concept evolved significantly from a "stupid factory" to a destructible planet, an idea suggested by a viewer which Kaze embraced: "Planet is cooler." This involves complex visual effects like the planet breaking apart.
- **Level Mechanics:**
    - Implementation of platforms that "get hot periodically" requiring timed movement.
    - Designing the spaceship interior with a sense of discovery and progression through distinct themed rooms (computer, specimen, engine, observatory).
- **Retro Section (Mario 64 Themed):**
    - Initial idea was to include all main SM64 areas, but this was deemed "too big." The scope was narrowed down to "snippets" or "highlights" from selected courses (e.g., Bob-omb Battlefield bridge, Whomp's Fortress tower, Jolly Roger Bay boat elements, Cool Cool Mountain cabin/slide, etc.).
    - Challenge of converting old SM64 level rips (.skp files) for use.
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - Ongoing bug fixing: visual glitches (e.g., sparks, smoke effects not rendering correctly), animation issues (portal animation broken), gameplay bugs (BLJ crashes).
    - Engine modifications leading to older content breaking: "This is what happens when you keep changing the engine, all the levels just break."
    - Performance optimization: Ensuring effects like smoke are not too resource-intensive ("make it only render if it's actually in view"), and being mindful of rendering costs for elements like "small splashes on the floor."
- **Swimming Mechanics:** Kaze feels standard Mario 64 swimming isn't ideal for RTYI's smaller water areas and aims for more direct control.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization/Funding:**
    - Kaze accepts donations, expressing a preference for PayPal over YouTube due to YouTube taking a "large cut."
    - He outsourced the creation of YouTube shorts for his main channel at a rate of "$5 per short."
- **Marketing/Distribution:**
    - While not explicitly commercial, Kaze is mindful of the ROM size ("58.8 megabytes"), keeping it within a self-imposed 64MB limit, relevant for potential N64 hardware play.
    - Demo feedback is considered, though Kaze feels he has received most of the useful feedback for the current demo.

## Key Quotes
- "Oh my God, dude, all the main courses will be finished. That will feel so good." (Reflecting on a major development milestone).
- "I've come to realize that it's very important to constantly edge the player. So that's what we're doing." (Explaining a core game design philosophy).
- "That would also be lower poly than my whole stupid factory here. And I hate that I have this whole factory here actually... Planet is cooler." (On making a significant design change based on a better idea).
- "This is what happens when you keep changing the engine, all the levels just break." (On the challenges of iterative development and engine modification).

- The overworld of Yoshi's Island is a major component that still requires substantial work and will consist of multiple sections.
- Development involves iterative design, with Kaze working through level layouts (e.g., volcano section, slide section, town section), addressing memory constraints, and fixing graphical issues like UV mapping.
- Kaze mentions working on various level concepts including a water level, areas with merry-go-rounds, a Toxic Maze, Volcano Climb, Leaf Pyramid, and a section involving flying from pillow to pillow with a Wing Cap.
- Memory management is a recurring concern, with Kaze needing to optimize and be mindful of RAM limitations for the N64.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a complex attitude towards Nintendo: he's aware of and somewhat expects a takedown for RTYI but also sees it as a potential PR opportunity or a catalyst to develop an original commercial game. He states, "Yeah this game is definitely going to be taken down by Nintendo at some point That's why we do need a better plan with it."
- He is passionate about improving upon the original Mario 64's technical aspects, aiming to fix issues like "fucked up UV coordinates" while largely maintaining the "vanilla shitty aesthetic."
- Kaze acknowledges his streaming style, stating, "Please keep note that when I'm streaming I am yapping, and when I'm yapping I do not remember anything I say."
- He shows a willingness to address community concerns, such as modifying a potentially offensive level ("Chess" level) based on feedback.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" mentioned in this transcript.
- **Biobak (graphics artist):** No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" mentioned in this transcript. (A "Biotech" is mentioned for level design on a separate commissioned project, "Drug Mario.")
- **Zeina (animations):** No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" mentioned in this transcript. (Kaze mentions watching anime with "Zainab," which might be a personal acquaintance or a typo).
- **Other Contributors (for RTYI or providing general support):**
    - **Decoy (stream viewer):** Provided significant real-time feedback on RTYI level design, particularly suggesting splitting levels more, which Kaze found valuable and agreed to implement. Kaze offered Decoy the opportunity to design a section.
    - **Mayamek (community member):** Mentioned in relation to the "Chess" level, indicating Mayamek was likely aware of or involved in the original design or discussion about its intent.
    - **Wameg (community creator):** Creator of "Only Up 64," a game that inspired the concept for RTYI's final retro pipe section.
    - **Yoshi Party (stream viewer, likely):** Thanked for providing an expanded ROM, which aids development.
    - **The second unabandoned (commissioner):** Commissioned Kaze for the separate "Drug Mario" project.
    - **Biotech (collaborator on "Drug Mario"):** Credited with making most of the levels for the "Drug Mario" commissioned project.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Censorship/Redesign of "Chess" Level:** A level with political themes ("all koopas are bastards") and flags perceived as offensive by some in the LGBT community is being redesigned to feature Bowser flags and "anti-Bowser protest" elements to mitigate offense.
- **Ambitious "Retro Pipe" Final Level:** Designing a section to include elements from all Mario 64 levels simultaneously, inspired by "Only Up 64."
- **Memory Management:** A consistent challenge is working within the N64's RAM limits, requiring low-detail models and careful optimization. Kaze notes, "Our main issue here is that we are running out of memory." (Though later checks suggest more space, indicating it's a fluctuating or section-specific concern).
- **Level Splitting and Flow:** Kaze is actively working on splitting levels into smaller, more fragmented sections based on feedback (from "Decoy") to improve difficulty and player experience.
- **Maintaining "Vanilla" Aesthetic While Improving Flaws:** A core design goal is to keep the N64 look and feel but fix technical shortcomings like UV mapping.
- **Player Accessibility and Skips:** Kaze aims for the game to be beatable without extended movesets or the Wing Cap, but still wants to allow for creative player skips. He states, "I want player to at least be creative when they skip something, otherwise it's not fun."
- **Technical Limitations:** Dealing with issues like "fucked up UV coordinates," ensuring proper texture application (including vertex colors), and managing render distances within engine capabilities.

## Business Aspects
- **Contingency Plan for Nintendo Takedown:** Kaze frequently discusses the likelihood of Nintendo taking down the ROM hack. His plan is to use this as a "PR move" and redevelop the project into an original game ("Return to Dinosaur Island") to be sold on platforms like Steam. He views this as a "win-win" situation.
- **Monetization of Original Game:** "In fact, I kind of almost want them to take a bow, because then I have an excuse to just turn this into my own game and sell it on Steam or something."
- **Paid Commission Work:** Kaze mentions a separate "paid commission" project, "Drug Mario," indicating he undertakes monetized game development work outside of his personal ROM hacking projects.

## Key Quotes
- "I'm not scared of the Nintendo Ninjas. I am fully aware that I might get taken down, but if that happens, we can use that to spin some PR moves, and just rewrite the game into my own custom game." - Kaze Emanuar on potential Nintendo action.
- "The retro section is not just level lava then, it's going to be every Mario 64 level at the same time. We're going to be retroing out so much." - Kaze Emanuar on the ambition for the final level of RTYI.
- "Our main issue here is that we are running out of memory. So we have to keep this somewhat low detail." - Kaze Emanuar on a recurring development challenge.

## Game Development Process
- The Overworld design is a primary focus and considered the "last major thing" before shifting to smaller tasks.
- The development process for the Overworld involves 2D sketching (in Photoshop), creating 3D sketches, and plans for beta testing these sketches to gather player feedback for iterative adjustments.
- Specific levels are being completed, with "Course 15 is finished, yeah" mentioned as a milestone. This course is retro-themed, incorporating elements from Mario 64.
- The game is planned to be substantial, with Kaze envisioning the Overworld to be "around four times the size of Super Mario 64 Biobank."
- Side levels are planned and spaces are being considered for them within the Overworld structure.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has a strong design philosophy: "For the overworld it's very important to me that if you can see it as a player then you can go there so I want the player to experience like every single inch of yoshi's island in the end."
- He values unique and creative solutions, often referring to good ideas as "banger ideas."
- Kaze admits to a personal challenge with collaboration: "I also have this weird thing where I do not want to reach out to people and ask for help Because a lot of the time I feel like I'm gonna say all this actually isn't up to the quality standards I expect... That always feels like super bad for everyone involved."
- He is working on the stream despite being "really sick," indicating dedication but also a potential impact on his work.
- He expresses a desire for level entrances to be unique and memorable: "One thing I definitely want in this is unique ways to discover level entrances."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Madu):**
    - Kaze is considering asking Madu to "make a remix of all the more 64 songs."
    - Kaze states, "I think but who [Madu] wants to make the whole OST But I'm not a hundred percent."
    - Role: Composer, potentially for the entire Original Soundtrack (OST), with a focus on remixes.
- **Biobak (Biobank):**
    - Kaze actively seeks Biobak's opinion on design ideas during the stream (e.g., "Biobank, what do you think about the idea of, like, make this a true river...").
    - Engages in discussions about game design conventions with him.
    - Role: Acts as a sounding board for design ideas and provides feedback.
- **Zeina (Zayn/Zayna):**
    - "Yeah, Zayn already has a lot of sketches about how Mario goes through the levels."
    - "Zena's drawing them right now to kind of look like a rainbow board from Mario Kart" for Course 15.
    - Involved in creating visual assets and level edits.
    - Role: Artist/Animator, providing sketches, art assets, and contributing to level visuals.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Esa:** "The side level Esa's making is also very gimmicky... It's very slidey."
    - Role: Level designer, creating a side level with specific mechanics.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Structure:** The Overworld is envisioned as the entirety of Yoshi's Island, divided into multiple (around 14) interconnected "small areas" to allow for varied vibes. There's a desire for a 360-degree view of the island from certain points.
- **Level Unlocking & Progression:** A significant challenge is how to gate progression and level entrances. Kaze wants to avoid "cheap" mechanics like simple star doors if possible, preferring puzzles or thematic unlocks. He brainstorms ideas like:
    - Kamek creating magic barriers requiring stars.
    - Mice needing "power of five stars" to clear an obstacle.
    - A boat sliding further towards a river (Course 2 entrance) with each star.
    - Using a lighthouse beam to reveal the Ghost Ship.
    - Potentially having Wario guard the Zoo entrance, requiring stars or a puzzle.
- **Unique Level Entrances:** A core design goal is to have unique and memorable ways to access levels (e.g., the lighthouse idea for the Ghost Ship, a burrow entrance for Bunny Brushwoods, a boat that slides towards a river).
- **Player Guidance & Pacing:** Kaze considers how players will navigate and unlock the world, including "quick warp" pipes to connect distant Overworld parts after initial exploration, describing some sections as "edging" the player's curiosity.
- **Inspiration and Originality:** Kaze draws inspiration from "Yoshi's Island" (SNES), "Super Mario 64," and other Mario titles (Mario Party, Paper Mario) but aims to create original mechanics and layouts, e.g., debating whether the island should be shaped like a Yoshi.
- **Specific Area Concepts:** Detailed brainstorming for various Overworld areas like beaches, cliffs, jungles, Bowser Mines (initially inaccessible), a ghost ship, a zoo, an ice cap level, broken castles, a super happy tree, a waterfall area, a volcano area, and underwater caves.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Timing:** "I don't know about 2025 release." Indicates a tentative and uncertain release window.
- **Marketing (Implicit):** The initial tutorial section is described as "just marketing to a ship," suggesting it's designed to hook the player and showcase the game's appeal.
- No other explicit mentions of funding, formal distribution plans, or other business aspects were found, which is typical for a ROM hack project.

## Key Quotes
- "The idea for the Overworld is that the Overworld is the entirety of Yoshi's Island." (Core concept for the game's hub world)
- "What if the ship is here, but it's like a shadowy fix, and you have to go into the lighthouse that is down here. And in the lighthouse, you point the light at the ship. And that makes the ship visible and breaks through the fog. And now you can actually enter it. I think that's a banger idea." (Example of creative problem-solving for a level entrance)
- "For the overworld it's very important to me that if you can see it as a player then you can go there so I want the player to experience like every single inch of yoshi's island in the end." (Kaze's core design philosophy for exploration)

## Game Development Process
- The primary focus of the current development stage is the design and structuring of the game's overworld, which is described as "massive."
- Kaze is working on the "general shape of the overworld" and then plans to "start honing in on the individual areas."
- The hub world is being "completely remaking it basically."
- A significant ongoing task is finalizing the game's story, particularly the motivations for Bowser and the details of the final (third) Bowser level and boss fight.
- The overworld is planned to have 13 main land/underwater parts, plus 2 additional cloud parts, making 15 distinct areas.
- The game will feature 15 main course entrances, 4 cap statues, and at least 5 side levels (with potential for more).
- 21 stars are planned for the overworld itself, comprising secret levels, special events, and secret stars.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong preference for an interconnected overworld where player actions in one area can have effects or unlock content in earlier areas: "What I like about this is how it's connected... I think that's how it should be."
- He values creating a sense of anticipation for the player by allowing them to see landmarks of future, yet inaccessible, areas: "I think the main part about this is that we have landmarks in future parts that you look forward to exploring that's like the most important principle."
- Kaze is enthusiastic about the potential for dynamic events in the overworld, such as a "pirate invasion."
- He is concerned with story coherence, wanting later plot points to build logically on earlier ones, and debates extensively on making the final boss thematically appropriate (e.g., "it doesn't build on what happened before I want to symbol on what happened before").
- Kaze expresses enthusiasm for the current overworld plan: "I'm really enthusiastic about the overworld."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** While not explicitly named, the game's Original Soundtrack (OST) is mentioned as being very fitting for the overworld design: "we are going to listen to the OST today because it's so fitting with how this overworld works."
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist/Designer):** Biobak (referred to as "Biobank" at times in transcript, likely a typo or chat name) is an active collaborator. Kaze discusses detailed overworld plans and final boss concepts with him during the stream, seeking his input: "I can send you the full overworld plan if you want... But you might have some really good ideas for it." and "No, the final boss would be Giga Bowser Biobank." Biobak also seems to be working on specific graphical elements, as Kaze mentions "there's still the biobank rework still."
- **Zeina (Animations):** No relevant information found.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - The development involves collaborative modeling efforts: "This is the ship we modeled for the Bowser 2 level." (The "we" implies a team effort).
    - Numerous chat participants (Tea Time, Dark Waze, GTM, etc.) offer suggestions and feedback during the stream, influencing the brainstorming process, though not formal contributors in the same vein as Biobak.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Shape & Structure:** The overworld will be "YoshiShaped," but not perfectly, and so large that its shape might not be apparent during gameplay. It's divided into 15 distinct loading zones/parts.
- **Progression and Unlocks:** Progression is gated by star counts and specific events/actions. For example, beating Bowser 1 unlocks a new section of the overworld. Some areas require specific cap abilities or solving puzzles (e.g., rotating a lighthouse).
- **Story Integration:** A major challenge is crafting a coherent story, particularly Bowser's motivations and the nature of the third Bowser level. The team is exploring themes like Bowser as a "ruthless capitalist."
    - "I feel like to make the third Bowser level we need to make the story first and we haven't really done that."
    - "Our number one concern is what is the third bowser level and number two is what other events we want to add."
- **Final Boss Conceptualization:** Extensive discussion focuses on the final boss encounter, with ideas including a Mecha Bowser level, a Giga Bowser fight (Mario also becoming Giga), and using the Super Happy Tree (or a "Super Sad Tree" variant) as a mechanic. The challenge lies in making this feel like a natural culmination of the story and gameplay.
- **Course Design Gimmicks:** Examples include Course 5 (Wario Zoo) where the ticket price is always one more coin than the player has, requiring an alternative entry method.
- **Interconnectivity:** A core design goal is to have different parts of the overworld influence each other, with later game actions potentially opening up things in earlier areas.

## Business Aspects
- No relevant information found.

## Key Quotes
- "What I like about this is how it's connected to this how oftentimes you like make progress in the overworld and do a thing and that makes something happen in an earlier part of the overworld I think that's how it should be." (Kaze on overworld design philosophy)
- "I think the main part about this is that we have landmarks in future parts that you look forward to exploring that's like the most important principle." (Kaze on player anticipation)
- "I think our number one concern is what is the third bowser level and number two is what other events we want to add... I feel like to make the third Bowser level we need to make the story first and we haven't really done that." (Kaze on key development challenges)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Iterative Design of the Overworld:** Explore the process of "remaking" the hub world, the decisions behind its 15-part structure, and the philosophy of interconnectedness and foreshadowing.
- **Crafting Bowser's Narrative Arc:** Delve into the development of Bowser's "ruthless capitalist" persona and the challenges and breakthroughs in designing a thematically consistent and engaging final encounter.
- **Collaborative Dynamics:** Discuss how Kaze works with collaborators like Biobak and the composer, and how their input shapes the game's design, visuals, and atmosphere.
- **The Role of the Super Happy Tree:** Unpack the significance of the Super Happy Tree, its connection to Yoshi's Island lore, and the creative process leading to its proposed role in the game's finale (e.g., the "Super Sad Tree" concept).
- **Balancing Player Freedom and Guided Progression:** Investigate the design choices behind the star system, event triggers, and secret unlocks in a large, multi-part overworld, and how these elements aim to guide yet empower the player.

## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is in a late stage of development. All 15 main courses are complete.
- **Current Focus:** Development is currently centered on the overworld (which will have 14-15 distinct parts), remaining side levels, and incorporating reworks from collaborator Biobank.
- **Overworld Development Strategy:** Kaze plans to design all overworld parts simultaneously as a basic blockout, then adjust them. The process involves:
    1. Rough draft/blockout of all areas.
    2. Implementation of gameplay elements.
    3. Beta testing.
    4. Visual polishing and making them "look nice."
- **Beta Testing:**
    - Beta testing for RTYI is planned to start "pretty soon," possibly before the overworld is entirely finished.
    - The initial RTYI beta will involve sending demos with single levels to testers for iterative feedback and improvement.
    - Kaze is also starting beta testing for another, unrelated game called "Direct Mario."
- **Milestones:**
    - Completion of all 15 main courses is a major milestone.
    - The next significant milestone appears to be a functional, draft version of the entire overworld.

## Personal Insights
- **Importance of Overworld:** Kaze considers the overworld to be "the most important part of the game" and is dedicating significant effort and care to its design to ensure it's intriguing and engaging.
- **Personal Enjoyment as a Motivator:** Kaze states, "generally I do not like developing games that I personally wouldn't enjoy," indicating his passion for the project and his creative choices are driven by his own interest.
- **Design Philosophies:**
    - Believes "contrast is what makes the art," referring to level design that can feel oppressive initially before opening up.
    - Values creating emotional bonds between players and game elements, citing Pokémon Red/Blue's battle system as an example of fostering value for a player's companions.
    - Expresses a dislike for SM64 randomizers that lack inherent design, preferring procedurally generated content with more structure.
- **Development Approach:** He is transparent about the development process, including challenges and unfinished aspects, but also expresses frustration with repetitive questions about obvious bugs in work-in-progress elements.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No direct mention of Badub or specific musical contributions in this transcript. Kaze generally mentions, "I was thinking I would buy the rights for the music at the end and then make an OST cartridge," indicating music is a planned component.
- **Biobank (Graphics Artist/Level Reworker):**
    - Biobank is "reworking all the levels."
    - Kaze is paying Biobank "a lot for that," highlighting a significant financial aspect of the collaboration. This work is one of the remaining major tasks for the game.
- **Zeina (Animations):** While not explicitly detailed as working on RTYI in this stream, Kaze discusses "new idle animations" and chat mentions fixing "the head animation." This suggests ongoing animation work for Kaze's projects, which typically involves Zeina. Mario's model is also being reworked, which is tied to animation.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **"My editor"**: Kaze mentions having a video editor whom he needs to pay, funded by YouTube sponsorships. This supports his content creation which, in turn, can fund game development.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Design & Scale:**
    - A recurring challenge is getting the scale and layout of overworld sections right so they are engaging and not "too fucking big" or "unfun to walk around."
    - The goal for the initial overworld area is "to build intrigue in the player" and "Ignite the desire... to want to explore the next part."
    - Iterative design is evident, with Kaze frequently adjusting layouts, sizes, and element placements based on "how it feels."
    - The overworld will feature 14-15 interconnected parts, compared in complexity more to Banjo-Kazooie than SM64.
- **Non-Deterministic RNG:**
    - Kaze created a new, faster random number generation function.
    - An unintended consequence is that it "kind of uses like true noise on accident so it may be impossible to test this game" (specifically for Tool-Assisted Speedruns due to lack of determinism, even across save states on emulators and real hardware).
- **Tutorialization and Player Guidance:**
    - Emphasis on subtle tutorialization: the first swimming experience is in shallow water; a Cheep Cheep holding a sign is planned to teach swimming controls.
    - Initial overworld design aims to make the player feel "stuck" briefly to encourage exploration before finding the first course (Bunny Brushwoods). Course 1's entrance (a barrel) might be blocked by a Pachyderm, requiring coins or knowledge of ground-pounding to pass.
- **Mario's Model & Animations:**
    - Mario's model is still being reworked. This is a reason for not immediately fixing certain visual bugs (like the hat texture when Mario takes it off), as the fix would need to be redone.
- **Progression and Unlocks:**
    - The overworld will change as the player progresses (e.g., a Bowser door requiring 4 stars, a Course 2 door requiring 1 star).
    - A "message in a bottle" event is planned after 2-3 stars, leading to a secret star.
- **Performance:** Kaze emphasizes caring about performance, aiming for the game to run well on N64 hardware, contrasting with some modern unoptimized games.

## Business Aspects
- **Funding Model:**
    - The game's development is costly, with Kaze stating, "The game as a whole is going to cost me in the tens of thousands."
    - Funding comes from his Patreon, YouTube channel (ad revenue, sponsorships), and donations.
    - He mentions the possibility of starting a "donation drive" to cover costs, particularly for paying collaborators like Biobank.
- **Monetization of Content:**
    - Kaze waits for sponsors to release some of his planned YouTube videos, as he needs to pay his video editor.
    - He humorously mentions product placement as potentially "the only way to monetize romhacking."
- **Release/Distribution:**
    - Primarily a ROM hack for N64 emulators/hardware.
    - There's a passing thought about a potential PC port: "There's a consideration to strip this off copyright stuff and, like, put it out as a PC game as well. So, like, everyone can just play it without needing an emulator."
    - Kaze mentions potentially making an OST cartridge if he buys music rights.

## Key Quotes
- "We basically just finished course 15, which means all the main courses are done. Now, all that's remaining is some side levels, Biobank's reworks, and the overworld." (Provides a clear status update on game completion.)
- "I think the overworld is the most important part of the game. So we're putting a lot of care into this." (Highlights Kaze's focus and the significance of the overworld in RTYI.)
- "The game as a whole is going to cost me in the tens of thousands... Yes, Biobank is reworking all the levels and I have to pay him a lot for that." (Emphasizes the financial commitment and collaborative nature of the project.)
- "I made a new random function... it kind of uses like true noise on accident so it may be impossible to test this game." (Reveals a unique technical aspect and an associated challenge.)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Vision for the Overworld:** Explore Kaze's initial vision for such an expansive and interconnected overworld in RTYI and how that vision has evolved through the development process shown in the stream.
- **Collaboration and Team Dynamics:** Discuss the process of working with and managing paid collaborators like Biobank on a large-scale fan project, including challenges and rewards.
- **Financial Realities of Ambitious ROM Hacking:** Delve deeper into the costs involved, the effectiveness of his current funding strategies (Patreon, YouTube, donations), and his thoughts on the sustainability of developing such projects.
- **The "True Noise" RNG System:** Ask for more details on the technical discovery of the non-deterministic RNG, his decision to keep it, and his perspective on its impact on the speedrunning community and the game's testability.
- **Player Experience and Design Philosophy:** Inquire about the core design principles guiding the development of RTYI's overworld, particularly how he aims to balance player freedom, guidance, intrigue, and the tutorialization of new mechanics.

## Game Development Process
- Kaze is currently working on the first overworld of "Return to Yoshi's Island," specifically the second part, out of a planned 15 parts for the entire overworld.
- A major focus is on extensive custom engine development. Kaze states, "almost all of this engine here is my engine at this point," with only Mario's core physics and some actions remaining from vanilla SM64. This includes custom rendering, animations (quaternions), camera, collision, and even reworking the N64 operating system (Libultra).
- The development strategy is iterative and non-linear; areas are not fully completed before moving on, to allow for adjustments as other parts of the game take shape ("because when we work on the other areas we will likely have to adjust this one again").
- Specific current tasks include designing coin collection for the overworld, implementing environmental features like a volcano, and developing complex mechanics like the dynamic fog for the ghost ship area.
- Skyboxes are custom-made 3D models, not using the standard Mario 64 system.
- Work involves significant problem-solving for N64-era technical limitations, such as creating convincing volumetric-looking fog.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar is driven by passion for "Return to Yoshi's Island," stating, "this one here is not any paid work at all this is just me working because of passion." This is contrasted with other commissioned projects he undertakes.
- He has strong opinions on game design, believing that "sometimes the part that people least like about the game are also the parts that are most necessary to make the game's design work."
- Kaze expresses frustration with inefficiencies in existing software and code, such as "lip ultra is dog shit unoptimized piece of shit code" and issues with NVIDIA Broadcast.
- He reflects on personal challenges like aging and maintaining cognitive sharpness ("Sometimes I feel like I'm getting older and my brain doesn't work like it used to anymore").
- Kaze is open about the development process, including moments of feeling "burned out," and is willing to admit when initial ideas aren't perfect ("I think their design is a little not great...they're still not perfect").
- He believes that "only really bad programmers care about which programming language they use for most applications" unless performance is critical.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No direct mention of Badub's work or contributions in this specific transcript.
- Biobak:
    - Biobak is responsible for significant graphical reworks of the overworld and levels. Kaze mentions, "I'd like to see the biobank rework of the overworld" and "Biobak is going to rework all levels here."
    - Biobak's work is considered a distinct phase; some features are planned "after biobank's final rework."
    - The level "ZooZooZoo" has already received a rework from Biobak, making it look better.
- Zeina: No direct mention of Zeina's animation work in this transcript, though Kaze mentions the animation system itself is custom (using quaternions).
- Other Contributors:
    - **Rovard and Voicel:** Mentioned as beta testers for Kaze's other project, "Drug Boss Mario."
    - **Mushi:** A fellow modder in the community, not directly involved with RTYI in this transcript.
    - **Chat Participants (e.g., Dainy Delphox/Leena):** Actively engage with Kaze during the stream, offering suggestions and feedback on design problems (like the fog effect), which Kaze considers and sometimes incorporates.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Design & Navigation:**
    - A key goal is to make the overworld (specifically "part 1") more engaging with collectible coins that are "easy to collect" without "making it suck."
    - Designing intuitive ways for players to navigate complex terrain, considering players who might not know advanced techniques like wallkicks ("I fear that some people that are here will not even understand what a wallkick is").
    - Creating varied and natural-looking barriers instead of just cliffs, e.g., "giant fruit," "tree line," "bananas."
    - Managing the scale and connectivity of 15 overworld parts, ensuring they feel cohesive. Kaze mentions being "a little worried that you can't really see the yoshi shape of the old in the end."
- **Ghost Ship Fog Mechanic:**
    - A major challenge discussed is implementing a dynamic fog effect for the ghost ship area (Course 4 entrance). The fog needs to obscure the ship initially, clear up after the player activates a lighthouse, and be technically feasible.
    - The solution involves fog intensity changing based on camera angle relative to the ship and player proximity. Getting too close before unlocking results in a fade-to-white and respawn. "How it's going to work is, here's the full idea. You enter this area, and when you look at the ship, there's going to be very strong fog..."
- **"Course for submissions" (User-made courses):** These required at least one rework to improve their quality ("their design is a little not great...we have already reworked all of them once to make them less bad").
- **Engine and Technical Features:**
    - Implementing custom rendering for coins (not 2D sprites or simple 3D models), Mario, and skyboxes (custom 3D models).
    - Reworking Mario's walking and swimming mechanics for better control and interaction with terrain.
- **Tutorialization:** Kaze reflects on how Mario 64 teaches movement and is mindful of teaching players in RTYI.

## Business Aspects
- "Return to Yoshi's Island" is explicitly stated to be a passion project, not a commissioned work: "this one here is not any paid work at all this is just me working because of passion."
- Kaze mentions the technical changes needed if he "wanted this to be like legally sellable," including replacing Mario's assets and the sound engine, and further customizing the OS. This indicates an awareness of commercialization requirements, though not an explicit plan for RTYI.
- He notes that his other project, "Drug Boss Mario," *is* a commissioned game, highlighting that he does undertake paid ROM hacking work.
- For "Drug Boss Mario," he discusses a phased beta testing approach, initially limiting access to long-time community members to "minimize the chance of leaks."

## Key Quotes
- "Well, what you probably don't realize is that like almost all of this engine here is my engine at this point. The only really thing that's still left from the vanilla 64 is Mario's physics." (Highlights the technical ambition and scope of custom work)
- "Sometimes the part that people least like about the game are also the parts that are most necessary to make the game's design work." (Kaze's game design philosophy)
- "This one here [Return to Yoshi's Island] is not any paid work at all this is just me working because of passion." (Clarifies the motivation behind the project)
- "Why don't we finish one area before moving on to the next um because when we work on the other areas we will likely have to adjust this one again so if we do that we waste a shit ton of that's why we don't do that." (Explains his iterative development methodology)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The motivation and process behind developing such a heavily customized engine for a ROM hack, and how it enables his vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- The collaborative workflow with Biobak: how are tasks divided, how is creative vision shared and aligned for level aesthetics and rework?
- Kaze's perspective on the balance between honoring the original Mario 64 feel and introducing new mechanics/themes from Yoshi's Island.
- Discussion on specific design challenges, like the ghost ship fog, and the iterative process of arriving at a solution, including community input.
- The long-term vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island": what does "completion" look like, and are there any aspirations beyond a fan project, given his thoughts on making it "legally sellable"?

## Game Development Process
- The stream focuses heavily on "overworld planning day," indicating a stage of defining the game's main hub world structure, layout, and progression flow for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
- Kaze emphasizes that current visuals are "temporary" and "crappy," highlighting an iterative process where gameplay and layout are prioritized before final art polish. ("So everything in the oil looks very crappy right now because it's all temporary.")
- Key activities include designing the zoo entrance, planning how the ice cap will be used for progression, connecting different overworld parts, and managing the overall size and feel of the island.
- There's a clear process of prototyping ideas, testing them in-engine, and discussing them live with the chat, leading to on-the-fly adjustments.
- Debugging is a visible part of the process, such as fixing the ice cap model and behavior ("Where's my ice cap? Either way, it looks like kicking up here will be an easy time. I am worried though, where the fuck is my ice cap?").
- Kaze is also working on another project, "Drug Mario," for which he plans to open beta tester applications.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a pragmatic approach to his online persona and content: "My political opinion is whatever will make me the most money in the long run and get me the most subscribers. I'm a company now."
- He is highly aware of how feedback is perceived and given, stating, "So if you like me and you're telling me that something I make is good, I will put less weight on that than if you hate me and you tell me something I made is good. It is because I'm a rational actor like that."
- Kaze acknowledges his own working style and personality: "Because of my personality type I'm very much immune towards like feeling bullied by criticism or anything like that. So when people criticize my stuff I don't mind." He also mentions, "I just don't have a very large emotional range."
- He values a critical environment for feedback: "Like I'm actively trying to foster an environment where people are critical of the stuff I make."
- He reflects on the nature of game development: "I never practiced programming, I was just working on my hacks and practicing programming was just an accident."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No direct mention of "Badub" by name in this transcript. Kaze mentions needing "some OST" and loads a file named "MarioFailURL.ost" and "To Amicia," suggesting music is being incorporated, but the composer's name isn't specified here.
- **Biobak:**
    - Kaze mentions needing to import an "ice thing" from Biobak: "Dude, I have a note in my to-do list that says import Biobank's ice thing and I forgot what it was."
    - Biobak seems to be involved in discussions about visual design and level transitions, with Kaze acknowledging and agreeing with Biobak's feedback on overworld area separation: "No, I get you. I get you Biobank. Don't worry. I understand 100% what you mean. And I think I'm agreeing with you."
- **Zeina:**
    - Provided a drawing for the zoo entrance concept: "They are a lot thicker in Zaina's drawing, so maybe I should make them thicker too."
    - Kaze also interacts with her personally during the stream regarding her phone.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Kaze's Wife:** Contributed an idea for the zoo entrance: "My wife sent me something here for the zoo entrance. Not this. Not this. This was the idea."
    - **Johan:** Made a significant financial contribution: "Johan, thank you for the 100 euro donation. Holy shit. That is very appreciated."
    - **Leela:** An active chat member providing feedback and suggestions, Kaze responds to her directly multiple times (e.g., "What do you not agree with, Lila?", "Thank you Leela.").
    - **Scott:** Mentioned in chat, prompting Kaze to discuss the book "Thinking Fast and Slow."
    - **Chat Community:** Plays a significant role in providing real-time feedback, suggestions, and questions that Kaze actively engages with, although he notes, "I would say around 80% of suggestions make things worse. But that's fine. My job as the lead designer on this game is to figure out what the 20% are."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Structure & Navigation:**
    - The overworld is a "gigantic" island in the "shape of a Yoshi hat." A major challenge is its current size ("the overload is way too big") and making it feel engaging rather than empty.
    - Progression between overworld sections is a key focus, with discussions on using the ice cap to reach new areas, and designing transitions (e.g., caves, fog) to make sense of distinct zones. ("First of all, you need the ice cap to get to the next part...").
    - Preventing players from sequence-breaking or getting lost: "How do we prevent the player from just forever walking around the beach?"
- **Course Entry Mechanics:**
    - **Zoo (Course 4):** Extensive discussion on how the player will enter. Ideas include Wario charging coins, a ticket system (monkey trading a ticket for a watermelon, or a penguin providing a ticket after being "caught"). The goal is to make it an engaging puzzle/quest. ("The way you enter this is that you actually buy a ticket... A monkey somewhere else tells you that he will trade you a zoo ticket for a watermelon.")
    - **Initial Course (Bunny Brushwoods):** Player needs 10 coins to get Pachyderm to move, or can ground pound him temporarily. This forces initial exploration.
- **Ice Cap Mechanics:**
    - The ice cap is a crucial item for progression ("you need the ice cap to get to the next part").
    - Challenges include implementing its functionality correctly (debugging missing models/behaviors) and designing puzzles around its use (e.g., reaching higher areas, walking on water/waterfalls).
- **Player Experience and Guidance:**
    - Balancing difficulty and intuition for puzzles and progression.
    - Tutorializing new mechanics like swimming: "there's going to be a cheep cheep coming up to you with a sign that has just a quick overview of the water controls."
    - Avoiding "false positive feedback" and ensuring design choices are genuinely good, not just liked by fans.
- **Technical Limitations:**
    - Polygon count concerns for rendering distant areas like the zoo from the main overworld.
    - Dealing with engine quirks or bugs ("Why, why the f**k is he swimming? Oh I know why. I hate this.").

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization/Funding:**
    - Receives donations during the stream (e.g., "Johan, thank you for the 100 euro donation.").
    - Mentions revenue from Twitter Blue: "Do you guys want to know how much money Twitter Blue made after five months? ... 23.76."
    - Has a sponsorship: "if you can't tell, I'm sponsored by Manscaped now."
- **Brand and Audience Management:**
    - Conscious of his public image and financial incentives: "My political opinion is whatever will make me the most money in the long run and get me the most subscribers. I'm a company now."
    - Discusses the "halo effect" and how taking stances can alienate parts of the audience.
- **Potential Partnerships:**
    - Mentions a potential integration with "brand red magic that do high-end gaming phones and tablets."
- **Marketing/Community Engagement:**
    - Plans to upload a video announcing beta tester applications for another project, "Drug Mario."
    - Actively uses his stream and YouTube channel (Case Clips) to share progress and engage with his audience.

## Key Quotes
- "Today is more of an overworld planning day... Look, this is my plan. We figure out how you enter course 4, which is this level here. We add the necessary geometry for that and then we shrink this to the minimum size that keeps all the elements that we like." (Outlining the development focus and iterative approach to the overworld)
- "My job as the lead designer on this game is to figure out what the 20% [of good suggestions] are. And because of my personality type I'm very much immune towards like feeling bullied by criticism or anything like that." (On his role and approach to community feedback)
- "So everything in the oil looks very crappy right now because it's all temporary... reminder that the way we're doing this is we're making a rough sketch of what each overworlds geometry will look like and roughly what the texture will be and then we're somewhat cleaning it up right now we're just making like the roughest of rough drafts we don't really care about visuals we only care about designing the gameplay right now." (Explaining the current state of development and priorities)

## Game Development Process
- The game is described as being in the "final stretch," with 15 courses already completed. Current work focuses on the overworld and then a couple more side levels.
- The overworld is being developed in distinct parts. Kaze is currently working on the "sketch" for "Part 2" (also referred to as Area 3 in one instance, possibly a typo or interchangeable term), which aims to connect "Part 1" and "Part 3." Outlines for Part 1 and Part 3 are already done.
- After Part 2's sketch is complete, "Part 4" is next. The total number of overworld parts seems to be around 5, based on discussions of accessing "Part 5." (A line "next is Part 4. Out of 50" appears in the transcript, but "50" seems anomalous or refers to something other than the main sequence of overworld parts, given the context of other statements.)
- Kaze uses reference images for level design (e.g., for cliffs in Part 2).
- Placeholder textures are used during the modeling and layout phase ("All of these are placeholder. It's not supposed to look pretty.").
- Kaze tests on real hardware at some point, though usually relies on intuition for performance.
- The project uses a custom engine with reworked collision handling, eliminating most invisible walls.
- Even after content completion, Kaze anticipates more work and a strategic release timing.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a cynical hope that Nintendo might issue a takedown so he'd be forced to swap assets and sell the game, highlighting a frustration with IP limitations on monetization.
- He is critical of formal game design education, believing the field is too new for established research to be highly valuable. He emphasizes the importance of psychology in game design, referencing "Thinking, Fast and Slow."
- Kaze acknowledges the role of fame in getting his work played and notes the increasing presence of "hacking for clout" and financial motivations within the modding community.
- He is working despite being "incredibly sick," which slows down his pace but doesn't stop him.
- He has a strong aversion to certain game mechanics if they don't feel thematically right or intuitive (e.g., Yoshis repairing bridges, paying Yoshis you just saved).
- He mentions not being a fan of 2D games generally and considers an analog stick a "dealbreaker."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** No specific mention of Badub or their contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** A viewer named "Biobank" (highly likely Biobak, as per prompt) is active in chat, and Kaze acknowledges their suggestions ("What Biobank says is a valid strategy."). The prompt identifies Biobak as the graphics artist, but this transcript doesn't detail specific graphical contributions being discussed during this stream segment.
- **Zeina (Animations):** Zayna is mentioned frequently in a personal context (Kaze being sick from her, her caring for him). She also participates in the design discussion ("No, that doesn't work Zena, it has to be from saving the Yoshis that you can make progress."). The prompt identifies her role as animations, but this specific transcript segment doesn't cover animation work.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Aesir:** A 3D modeler to whom Kaze forwards commission requests. Kaze considered opening a store for commission models primarily to channel work to Aesir.
    - **Wiseguy:** Creator of an early portable Mario 64. His static recompilation method is mentioned as a potential way to port "Return to Yoshi's Island" to PC.
    - **Pannenkoek (pannenkoek2012):** Not a direct collaborator, but his M64 analysis videos (specifically on invisible walls) inspired a YouTube video idea for Kaze.
    - **Keaton (chat viewer):** Frequently offers suggestions that Kaze acknowledges positively (e.g., "Yeah, that's a good idea, Keaton.").

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Progression Gating:** A significant challenge is designing how the player accesses later parts of the overworld (specifically "Part 5," the second main overworld area).
    - Initial idea: A Yoshi repairs a bridge for 100 coins after being freed. Kaze dislikes this because Yoshis aren't known for repairing bridges, and it feels wrong to charge the player after a rescue.
    - Evolved idea: A Dory is found chained in a lake. After the first Bowser is defeated and Yoshis are freed, a Yoshi is found on Dory's back, having freed her. The player can then ride Dory to the new area. This makes Yoshis active helpers.
- **Course 3 Entrance:** Designing the entrance to Course 3. An initial idea involving smashing rocks if Mario has 5 stars was dismissed as the area already requires 5 stars. The current idea is a mouse/mole NPC in a mineshaft who will continue mining (revealing the entrance) for 100 coins. This sets a precedent for coins having utility in the overworld.
- **Player Experience and Difficulty:** Kaze wants to avoid player frustration. For instance, in an area called "New World," he doesn't want the player to easily fall to their doom, as it's not meant to feel overly dangerous. He struggles with finding solutions (e.g., water might not fit the "dry land" theme of an island's middle).
- **Camera Control:** Kaze aims to give players full camera freedom but also wants scenes to look "cool," requiring level design that naturally facilitates good views.
- **Island Shape:** An initial idea to make the main island Yoshi-shaped was deemed not critical and ultimately not closely followed ("This island isn't Yoshi-shaped at all. It's not even close to Yoshi-shaped... The island doesn't need to be shaped like a Yoshi.").
- **Preventing Sequence Breaking ("Cheese"):** While Kaze is aware players will try to find unintended skips, he's generally lenient ("If you find a way around it, be my guest. I don't want to put fake barriers there.").
- **Invisible Walls:** Kaze's engine has reworked collision, so he generally doesn't use invisible walls unless there's "legitimately no level boundary."

## Business Aspects
- **Sponsorship:** Kaze has a sponsorship deal with Squarespace, requiring him to make 6 videos in 3 months. He plans to create videos about "actor reworks" to fulfill this, as it's "way too much money to not take it."
- **Monetization Strategy (or lack thereof for the hack):** The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" will be free because it uses Nintendo's IP.
- **Potential Future Monetization:** Kaze half-jokingly hopes Nintendo issues a C&D, as this would necessitate replacing Nintendo assets, potentially allowing him to sell the game with original assets.
- **Patreon:** Kaze mentions having a Patreon account for support.
- **Commission Store Idea:** He considered setting up a store for 3D model commissions, primarily to direct work and income towards another artist, Aesir.
- **YouTube Monetization:** Kaze notes that when he's "not properly monetizing" his YouTube channel, he feels he gets less legal attention from Nintendo.

## Key Quotes
- "I'm half hoping Nintendo shuts me down. So I have to exchange all the assets for non-Nintendo assets. So I can actually sell it." (Provides insight into his view on IP and monetization challenges for fan projects.)
- "Alright I think we can start working on part 2 then, since part 1 and part 3's outline is done... Complete this game so far, we have 15 courses done. And now we're doing the overworld, and then a couple more side levels. So I think it would be fair to say that this is like a final stretch, I guess." (Highlights the project's progress and structured development.)
- "Okay, how about this? So Dory chained to a wall in the lake. After beating the first Bowser, the Yoshi is on Dory's back... That makes the Yoshis be actors around the world too. So now they aren't just the helpless little guys, they're actually helping you." (Illustrates the iterative design process and focus on thematic depth for game mechanics.)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Grand Vision for RTYI:** "You've mentioned the game is in its 'final stretch.' Could you elaborate on your overarching vision for 'Return to Yoshi's Island'—what kind of experience are you aiming to deliver, and what do you hope players take away from it?"
- **Iterative Design and Thematic Storytelling:** "We saw you work through several ideas for gating progress, like the bridge evolving into the Dory concept. Can you discuss this iterative design process and how you ensure mechanics like these also serve the game's narrative and themes, such as making Yoshis active helpers?"
- **Navigating the Creator Economy as a Modder:** "You're balancing passion projects with sponsorships (like Squarespace) and Patreon, while also dealing with Nintendo's IP. How do you navigate these complexities, and what's your perspective on the future of large-scale fan games and their creators?"
- **Collaboration Dynamics:** (Assuming more info can be gathered on Badub, Biobak, Zeina) "Could you describe how the collaboration works with your team members like [mention collaborators by name and role, e.g., Badub for music]? How do their contributions shape the final game?"
- **Game Design Philosophy in Practice:** "You've expressed strong opinions on game design principles and the importance of psychology. How do these philosophies directly influence specific design choices in 'Return to Yoshi's Island,' beyond the examples discussed, such as level layout, enemy placement, or puzzle design?"

## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The game is in a phase where all 12 main courses are structurally complete, but significant work is ongoing for level reworks (primarily by Biobank) and overworld development. Kaze is currently focused on "part four of the overworld."
- **Development Stages/Philosophy:**
    -   Iterative design: Visuals and polish are secondary to gameplay functionality in early stages ("it looks like dark shit because we don't do the visuals until it's done because we still make a lot of changes").
    -   Hub world development is considered best done "in post" when all other game information is available.
    -   The overworld is planned to be extensive, with the current focus being on 4 out of an anticipated 15 parts.
- **Milestones:**
    -   Fixing critical bugs (end screen transition, render bug).
    -   Conceptualizing and implementing the overworld structure, aiming for a seamless experience connecting different parts.
    -   Redesigning the game's hub.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is open about his personal state affecting his work (e.g., being sick).
- He expresses a desire to create specific emotional impacts on the player, such as the "cool experience" of reaching the lighthouse after a long journey.
- He is not feeling "hard-pressed to release this as soon as possible," indicating a focus on quality over speed.
- He has a self-deprecating sense of humor regarding the early, unpolished visuals of the game ("it's supposed to look like dog shit").
- He reflects on his creative process, such as the "suspense treadmill" concept to maintain player engagement.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):**
    -   While Badub is not mentioned by name in this transcript, Kaze discusses the game's OST, including selecting music for the stream ("we need an OST for today") and a desire for a "physical cartridge release of the game's OST."
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist / Level Designer):**
    -   Plays a significant role in "level reworks" ("it's mostly Biobank doing them I think he's almost done with course 2 now").
    -   Actively participates in design discussions, as seen when Kaze addresses him directly about fast travel ideas ("Okay, Biobank, if you don't want pipes as fast travel, what would you like?").
    -   Is working on reworks for many of the "12 main courses" that are already done.
- **Zeina (Animations):**
    -   Mentioned in a humorous, non-work-related context regarding a heater issue ("it was Zena all along").
    -   Her specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" animations are not detailed in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Sauron (Soren):** Kaze discusses "important stuff" with him, specifically "his animation compression idea right now, that might save a little bit of performance."
    -   **Rionu:** Another modder whose work Kaze respects and sometimes emulates ("I'm copying whatever Rionu does. Since Rionu made the Vauri operation, I have to copy the Vauri operation").
    -   **Doriel:** Mentioned in an anecdote about ladder programming, suggesting she is part of the broader development/modding community.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Design:**
    -   **Seamlessness:** A major goal is to make the overworld transition seamlessly between areas without explicit warps ("Alright fine we'll make it seamless"). This presents significant technical challenges related to memory, loading times ("we don't have enough memory to just keep the old area loaded while loading a new one"), and engine limitations ("we can't render at all while loading in this engine").
    -   **Structure:** The overworld is designed to create a sense of discovery and return, e.g., seeing the lighthouse early on but only being able to reach it much later via a cave connection ("after you come out of the cave section you're gonna be here up top at the lighthouse... And I think that's gonna be a really cool experience").
    -   **Shortcut Mechanics:** Extensive discussion on how to create a permanent shortcut back up to the lighthouse (ideas include ropes, vines, breakable rocks, pipes, kickable platforms). The goal is a one-way unlockable path.
- **Hub World:** The old hub was unsatisfactory, leading to a "completely new one." Kaze believes hubs are best designed with full game context.
- **Fast Travel:** Various ideas are explored, from in-world elements like pipes and cannons to a UI-based system ("Imagine the pause menu here instead was a world map with a cursor... Man, that's tempting too. Should we do that? Yeah, that sounds so cool."). The world map idea seems to gain traction.
- **Loading Transitions:** If perfect seamlessness isn't achievable, Kaze considers alternatives like a "freeze frame, load the level, and unfreeze the frame" to mask loading.
- **Technical Limitations:** Constant struggle with SM64 engine limitations, memory ("I'm out of memory on my computer"), and performance, influencing design choices.

## Business Aspects
- **OST Release:** Kaze expresses a strong interest in a "physical cartridge release of the game's OST," believing it "would be the coolest shit ever."
- **Game Distribution:** He explicitly states he "can't release the game physically and I will actually get murdered," acknowledging the legal issues with selling a ROM hack.
- **Future Commercial Plans:** Kaze mentions, "Plus, hopefully I can make like a legally distinct version of this as well," hinting at potential future original projects inspired by or building upon this work.
- **Funding:** A viewer asks about donations, and Kaze's response ("it's legal to ask for donations for the game you couldn't") implies he is not soliciting donations for the game itself, though the phrasing is slightly ambiguous.

## Key Quotes
- "our mission today is to do part four of the overworld... And then after you come out of the cave section you're gonna be here up top at the lighthouse... And I think that's gonna be a really cool experience." (Explaining the player journey and design intent for the overworld)
- "Yes, the old hub sucked, I'm making a completely new one It's much better to decide on a hub in post than to do it while you're making the game The hub is the most important part, you need to make it with all the information available to you." (On hub design philosophy)
- "making this perfectly seamless actually doesn't work because of compression shit... we don't have enough memory to just keep the old area loaded while loading a new one... I'd have to make big changes that I'm not sure I'm willing to make." (Highlighting the technical challenges of the seamless overworld goal)

## Potential Interview Topics
- The detailed collaborative process with Biobank on level reworks and design: how are tasks divided, and how is creative vision shared and integrated?
- Exploration of the "legally distinct version": what aspects of "Return to Yoshi's Island" might carry over, and what are the broader ambitions for such a project?

## Game Development Process
- The game, "Return to Yoshi's Island," features a new, "huge overworld" designed as a single, interconnected level, replacing a previous iteration that didn't meet quality standards.
- Kaze estimates the project is roughly "10% done," indicating it's still in a relatively early but substantial phase of development.
- Active work is being done on various "parts" (sections/levels) of the overworld, including designing entrances and connections between them (e.g., Part 5, Part 7, Part 8, Course 6).
- The ROM size is currently just under 60MB.
- Playtesting is considered very valuable, with plans to get more individual playtests done to gather data.
- Kaze is using his custom game engine, which offers different functionalities compared to the vanilla Mario 64 engine (e.g., improved handling of invisible walls).
- Development involves iterative design, with Kaze frequently reassessing and looking to improve areas, such as making a cave "interesting" or redesigning a "depressing and sad" beach.
- There was a significant loss of "old hack code" and "a lot of documentation" due to a previous SSD failure, which has not been recovered.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses a strong preference for creating new systems rather than dealing with the frustrations of existing ones, stating, "It's not like you're making new systems, you know. That's what I do."
- A core design philosophy for the game is to have "secrets around every corner," aiming for a sense of discovery and depth.
- Kaze is critical of "safe" AAA game development and champions "risky" games that are creatively driven, citing the original Yoshi's Island as an example of the kind of innovative spirit he admires.
- He finds computers and their underlying systems "very frustrating to deal with."
- Kaze candidly shares his physical state, mentioning feeling "so sick today" and "very feverish," which impacts his streaming and potentially his work.
- He reflects on the limitations of the original Mario 64 engine, calling it "just the worst" and stating that programmers of that era (with some exceptions like Guile) "made everyone's job a lot harder."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No direct mention of Badub or specific musical contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript. Kaze does mention listening to an OST (Pokemon XY) and ensuring his Mario's sounds are audible.
- **Biobak:** Interacts with "Biobank" in chat, which is likely Biobak. No specific graphical contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are detailed in this transcript beyond Kaze mentioning some textures are "random texture from the N64."
- **Zeina:** Contributes visual concepts and drawings. Kaze refers to "Zena's drawings" for a cave design, though he decided to go in a different direction for that specific instance. He also mentions an "wasabi song" he invented that Zena doesn't believe is good.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **ESA:** "ESA is actually working on a slight level right now." (Assumed to be a level designer).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Redesign:** The original overworld was "completely erased" because it wasn't up to quality standards. The current approach is a "huge overworld" that is "all going to be one level."
- **Secrets and Exploration:** A primary goal is for "the whole island to feel like there's secrets around every corner."
- **Multiplayer:** Considered a desirable feature ("something I would like to do"), and Kaze doesn't think it would be "too difficult to do" in general, but specific elements like boss fights (e.g., "the raven boss fight") would be "jank with it."
- **Custom Engine Benefits:** Kaze's custom engine uses a "whole different step function" than vanilla Mario 64, which helps avoid issues like hitting "thin invisible walls."
- **Level Design Challenges:**
    - Making large areas like caves and beaches interesting and not "flat and boring."
    - Integrating numerous level entrances (e.g., "Part 7, part 8, part 9, part 6, and part 12 entrances") coherently.
    - Deciding how to handle transitions and player flow, e.g., what happens if a player falls down a river ("Do we make it so that if you fall down the river, you come back out in part one here? Or how do we stop the player from going through the river? I guess we can also just make a grate.").
- **Technical Issues:**
    - A major recurring challenge is disk space on his C: drive, which at one point prevented him from opening Photoshop. Much of the stream is dedicated to troubleshooting this.
    - Frustration with hard-coded file paths making SSD changes difficult.
    - Dealing with Windows updates potentially consuming disk space.
- **Specific Level Ideas/Features:**
    - A "cave offensive" or secret side level within a cave.
    - A river running through the whole island, connecting to a volcano area.
    - A secret loop back from a forest area to an earlier part of the overworld.
    - Course 6 ("Jurassic Jungle") featuring prehistoric Yoshis.
    - Considering adding Yoshi houses, rocks in the water, wooden bridges, trees, and sand dunes to make areas less flat.
    - Idea for a sandcastle obstacle course for a blue coin.

## Business Aspects
- **Sponsorships:** Kaze has "a lot of sponsors" that he needs to make videos for, indicating this is a source of income.
- **Donations:** He acknowledges a viewer donation ("Johan, thank you for the 100 for a new SSD...").
- **No Cartridge Sales:** Kaze explicitly states he will not be "releasing cartridges" or selling them due to "legal issues." The game will be released online via his YouTube channel.
- **Content Creation for Revenue:** Making videos for sponsors is linked to generating content for his audience.
- **Twitter Monetization Attempt:** Mentioned trying to make money from Twitter posts, but "that just did not happen."

## Game Development Process
- The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) is in a late stage of development, with the overworld design being a primary focus.
- Main courses (15 of them) are largely complete, though some are awaiting visual reworks by collaborator Biobak.
- Side levels are among the remaining tasks.
- The overworld is designed as one huge, seamless map.
- Kaze employs an iterative design process, especially for the overworld, where major layout changes occur before visual finalization ("And this is why we don't finish any visuals yet. It's because I make changes like this and that would ruin everything.").
- The game runs at 60 FPS on actual N64 hardware, with options like widescreen support.
- A key milestone is completing the "first draft of the overworld," with a goal to finish it within the next week or two from the stream's date.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze aims to create a game world that feels "alive" and "always-changing" through features like overworld events.
- He enjoys designing elements that "tease" the player, like a visible but initially inaccessible star ("I like the idea of there being a star visible the whole time you play the game, and you have no idea how to get to it.").
- He has strong opinions on game design, such as the utility of in-game currency ("we definitely need to add things that you can buy, otherwise you're gonna go your whole life collecting coins not knowing what they're for") and the nature of "chaos" hacks.
- He reflects on the expense of video editing for his YouTube channel, which supports his work indirectly.
- He expresses a desire for permanence in game changes resulting from player actions ("events need to be something you beat and then they give you a star. And then that permanently changes the overworld in some way.").

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** The composer for the game. He is currently "working with music a little bit trying to figure out what would work for the overworld."
- **Biobak:** A graphics artist responsible for significant visual reworks of levels. Kaze mentions levels looking "a lot better now" after Biobak's rework and that some levels are "still awaiting Biomech's rework." Biobak's work influences Kaze's timing for creating collision maps. Kaze also notes that Biobak "can change the collision while reworking but i don't think he does and it's not recommended he does."
- **Zeina:** Mentioned for cutting Kaze's hair. Kaze also looks for concept art possibly made by "Xena" (likely Zeina) for a gondola component, suggesting she contributes to art/design.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Aza:** Working on a side level dedicated to "crazy daisies."
    - **Lincoln:** Drew a thumbnail for one of Kaze's videos.
    - **Alok:** Mentioned as someone who might port a feature ("Minx") related to development.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Wing Cap Level Entrance:** A major design challenge is how players will access the Wing Cap level.
    - The initial idea of using a Cloud Cap was rejected because "the cloud cap is break all the visuals it's gonna make it so you can see all the magic happening and i i hate that." It would require too many restrictions on level modeling.
    - Alternative solutions brainstormed include: an overworld event (e.g., pirates attacking, then a sunken ship appears), a purchasable entrance, climbing a tree and bouncing, a chukster, or a "baby Yoshi crypt" in the Yoshi room shrinking the player.
    - The chosen solution involves the Yoshi room having a "baby Yoshi crypt" that warps the player, with the associated Yoshi Coin being obtainable via balloons blown by a Toad or held by Seals during different game "Acts."
- **Overworld Connectivity & Immersion:**
    - Strong emphasis on making the overworld seamless ("the entire overworld is going to be one huge map that's going to be seamless").
    - Ensuring thematic and physical connections between levels (e.g., Wing Cap level being above Koopa Wave Cove).
    - Avoiding designs that allow players to see "behind the curtain" or break immersion.
- **Coin Utility:** A conscious effort to make coins valuable by adding shops and purchasable items/access (e.g., paying 200 coins to a Bob-omb to use a cannon).
- **Overworld Events:** Designed to make Yoshi's Island feel dynamic and alive. These events are one-time occurrences that permanently change the overworld and reward a star.
- **Bowser Fight Arena:** Designing an area in the overworld that serves as a late-game Bowser fight arena without looking obviously like one early on. The solution involves an "apple tree garden" (or "melon garden") that becomes wilted and whose trees are destroyed during the fight, with thorn bushes appearing to block exits.
- **Player Overwhelm:** Concern about unlocking too many areas at once after a major story point, potentially causing "choice paralysis." This leads to considering ways to gate access to some later parts.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze finances his YouTube video editing through "sponsor deals."
- He plans to make a "video essay" about RTYI upon its release, suggesting a marketing/promotional strategy.
- There's an underlying awareness and concern about potential legal repercussions from Nintendo for creating a fan game ("Nintendo might just murder me.").
- No direct funding for RTYI itself is mentioned, but the YouTube channel which promotes it is supported by sponsorships.

## Key Quotes
- "The idea is that these [overworld events] really make Yoshi's Island feel alive, and like it's an always-changing island with things always going on."
- "having the cloudcap in the overworld is going to be awkward because what if you just go to a previous part and then you know break the world geometry and look over the walls and see nothing so i don't like that."
- "It's almost finished. What even left to do other than the overworld? Just some side levels. But yeah, the overworld is pretty much the last part."
- "I like the idea of there being a star visible the whole time you play the game, and you have no idea how to get to it. And then later you unlock it somehow. Yep, that looks great. That's such a tease."

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Grand Vision for the Overworld:** Explore Kaze's core design philosophies behind creating such a large, seamless, and interconnected overworld for RTYI and the challenges in realizing it on N64 hardware.
- **Collaborative Dynamics:** Delve deeper into the workflow and creative interplay between Kaze, Biobak (graphics), Badub (music), and other key contributors. How are creative visions aligned and potential conflicts resolved?
- **Balancing Mechanics and Immersion:** Discuss the decision-making process when powerful game mechanics (like the Cloud Cap) conflict with the desire to maintain player immersion and avoid "breaking the magic," using the Wing Cap level entrance as a prime example.
- **Player Progression and a "Living World":** Unpack the philosophy behind RTYI's progression system, particularly the role of overworld events, purchasable unlocks, and the goal of making the game world feel dynamic and permanently impacted by the player's actions.
- **Navigating the Fan Game Landscape:** Discuss Kaze's thoughts on the risks and rewards of developing ambitious fan projects like RTYI, his plans for release, and his perspective on the broader ROM hacking community.

## Game Development Process
- All 15 core courses for "Return to Yoshi's Island" are complete.
- Current development is heavily focused on designing and structuring the overworld, particularly how players progress through and unlock later sections (Parts 10-15).
- Kaze is working on implementing specific unlock mechanisms and gating content to prevent players from being overwhelmed.
- The game is intended to be a seamless, interconnected open world with no loading zones between areas.
- A new pause menu with an animated "unrolling map" feature is planned.
- Beta testing for player behavior and design feedback is a recognized need.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly focused on the player experience, aiming for "cool" moments and intuitive design.
- He has a strong design philosophy that favors player freedom, especially for main progression, preferring overworld events or broader achievements over specific, arbitrary tasks to unlock main paths.
- He values immersive design where barriers feel genuine rather than artificial game restrictions.
- Kaze expresses excitement for innovative features like the animated world map and unique NPC interactions.
- He uses self-deprecating humor (e.g., about his map's appearance) but shows clear passion for the project.

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No specific contributions or interactions mentioned in this transcript.
- Biobak: No specific contributions or interactions mentioned in this transcript. (Biobank is mentioned in chat, Kaze responds to them, but no specific RTYI contribution is detailed here).
- Zeina: No specific contributions or interactions mentioned in this transcript.
- Other Contributors:
    - **Martisti:** Working on a "Greek garden level" which is planned for the third overworld area (near Course 10). Kaze mentions Martisti's level looks "super cool" and is considering how its geometry might inspire solutions for overworld connections.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Major Challenge:** Structuring player progression for Parts 10-15. The initial setup allows access to too many areas at once, which Kaze wants to restrict to avoid overwhelming the player.
- **Solution Brainstorming for Progression:**
    - Initial ideas included star barriers or requiring completion of specific levels.
    - Kaze leans towards "Overworld Events" triggered by broader player progress (e.g., X stars collected) to unlock new areas.
    - Specific event ideas:
        - **Bone Dragon:** An initially hostile dragon in the lava area that can be befriended by fixing a problem (e.g., a cavity), then helps the player access a new area and potentially offers a star for a "gold tooth" quest. This is designed to subvert boss battle expectations.
        - **Yap Blocks & Kamek:** Using "Yap Blocks" (talking blocks from Yoshi's Island) to bar access to Part 13. A Kamek boss fight event would occur later in the game (e.g., in Part 5's area), and defeating Kamek would turn the (previously insulting/evil) Yap Blocks friendly, causing them to move and open the paths.
- **Seamless World Design:** A core goal is to have a fully interconnected overworld without loading screens, making the entire island feel like one large, explorable space.
- **Secret Back Entrance:** An idea for a secret back entrance to Course 1, potentially leading into a windmill with a small reward, designed to be a cool, purposeless discovery.
- **Pause Menu:** Decided to implement an unrolling map animation for the pause menu.
- **Target Audience:** Casual players looking for adventure and freedom.

## Business Aspects
- **Beta Testing:** Kaze is actively seeking beta testers to provide feedback on player behavior and design, rather than just bug testing. He's considering a Discord server for this.
- **Commissioned Work:** Kaze mentions "Drag Wars," a game he was commissioned to make, indicating he does paid game development work.
- **Release Version:** Currently, only an NTSC version is being worked on, though a PAL version might be possible later.
- **"Slop Video" Content:** Kaze notes the high engagement on his "slop videos" and considers making more due to YouTube analytics, a form of content strategy.

## Key Quotes
- "Okay, today we have a bit of an issue we need to solve. And that is the issue that once you unlock part 10, you can go to part 11, part 12, part 13, 14, and 15. And this is a bit much. For that reason, I want to lock part 13 and 15 away."
- "Yes, you look at him [Bone Dragon], you expect a boss battle, but do we really need a full boss battle? Isn't it way funnier and way more impactful if you don't get the boss battle you expect?"
- "The whole world is going to feel so alive. There's going to be events. Everything's connected. There's no loading zones. You just go from thing to thing. It's just going to feel like a gigantic open world. It's going to be insane, man."
- "I want people to feel like any barrier that they encounter is a genuine barrier and not just the game telling them. No."

## Game Development Process
- **Current Focus: Overworld Development:** Kaze is heavily focused on creating and refining the overworld for "Return to Yoshi's Island." He describes it as a "very difficult overworld to make" because it "is going to bring everything together."
- **Major Milestone Achieved: 360-Degree Island:** "The island is now complete. 360 degrees. You can go everywhere on this island." This foundational structure is in place, and the current work involves populating and refining it.
- **Modular Development:** He refers to working on specific parts of the overworld, such as "part 13," and mentions "part 14 and 15 left, which is above in the sky." This indicates a structured approach to building the game world.
- **Iterative Refinement:** After establishing the basic structure ("The concept works"), the next step is to "make it good now," suggesting a phase of iteration and polish.
- **Technical Aspects:** Mentions that the game has no memory leaks ("Memory leak is impossible because I don't use allocs") but "Buffer overflows definitely exist," though potentially hard to trigger. The game runs at "240p" on real hardware.

## Personal Insights
- **Motivation for Creation:** "Fun is not really something I think about when I make stuff." This suggests his drive comes from the act of creation, problem-solving, or achieving a vision, rather than continuous enjoyment of the process itself.
- **Self-Perception as a Developer:** "Contrary to popular belief, I am not educated on programming. I am just a crazy man with a hacks editor." He downplays formal programming knowledge, emphasizing an intuitive or tool-assisted approach.
- **Evolving Public Image:** "Back then I was just like a dude making Mario hacks and now people know me as the optimization guy. But I'm still just a dude making Mario hacks to be honest." He acknowledges a shift in how the community views him but remains grounded in his core identity.
- **Opinion on PC Ports:** He is critical of the widely known SM64 PC port ("I think it's garbage... It was made to be garbage"), strongly preferring and advocating for "static recompilation" (e.g., by Wiseguy) as a technically superior and mod-friendly alternative.
- **Future Aspirations:** "I definitely want to make commercial video games at some point. I think I have to move to that eventually. So hopefully then I'll move to PC development."

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Daryl and Isa:** Mentioned as collaborators on Kaze's past popular project, "R64 Chaos Edition." ("Daryl and Isa, they worked together to put me in my R64, and they called this chaos edition").
    - **PixelPallava:** Suggested a game mechanic idea for "Return to Yoshi's Island." ("So one idea that PixelPallava had earlier today was that maybe there should be a shop to buy a magnet that will suck in coins..."). Kaze seemed to dismiss this particular idea.
    - **Wiseguy:** Developer of a "static recompilation" tool for N64 games. Kaze speaks highly of him and his work ("This is made by a very competent person, Wiseguy... Wiseguy said that maybe he can port my mod to it once it's done. Which would be really, really cool.")
    - **Unnamed individual:** "The guy that did the measurements for whether the N64 runs faster at certain temperatures."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Centrality and Complexity:** The overworld is a critical, complex component. "This overworld is going to bring everything together. So this is going to be a very difficult overworld to make."
- **Scope Management:** "Now, there's actually a lot of ideas we have for this overworld, and it's actually so many that we cannot possibly fit all of them in."
- **Transformative Secret Stars:** A core design principle for overworld secrets is that they should impact the game world. "I want every star in the overworld to kind of transform the overworld in a way."
    - **Example - Rain Flower Star:** A detailed concept was workshopped: A sad blue sunflower causes rain. Helping nearby Yoshis (by paying Bowser's Builders to rebuild their houses) makes the flower happy, it turns yellow, the rain stops, and a star appears.
- **Player Guidance and Discovery:** The overworld is designed to naturally guide players and pique their curiosity about distant, initially inaccessible areas. "There's always like one thing, then you're like, oh my god, I wonder what that is, I need to go there."
- **NPC Backstory/Lore:** Bowser's Builders are characterized as having "decided to desert" Bowser after "OSHA violations in Koopa Carnival" and even attempted to unionize.
- **Overworld Map Feature:** "There's going to be a map in the overworld that has like the entire thing. And it's gonna look kinda like this, and it's gonna unroll when you open the pause menu."
- **Tools:** Kaze mentions using "ROM Manager since 2018" and notes that "Toadstool is from the 2017 era. It's been outdated since then... There's also Quad64, which replaces Toadstool."

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube Sponsorship:** "I'm going to spend so much time in the next few weeks making videos because I have a Squarespace sponsorship, and they need me to make six videos in three months, but they pay really well, and I need money." This directly funds his work/living.
- **Future Commercial Ambitions:** "I definitely want to make commercial video games at some point. I think I have to move to that eventually."
- **Distribution Considerations (Indirect):** His strong preference for the "static recompilation" PC port method and willingness to have his mod ported ("if people ask me to put my mod on the static recompilation, I would be much more open to that") suggests consideration for broader accessibility for his work, though not direct sales of the ROM hack.

## Key Quotes
- "The island is now complete. 360 degrees. You can go everywhere on this island... We just need to make it good now. But the concept works." (Milestone and development philosophy)
- "Contrary to popular belief, I am not educated on programming. I am just a crazy man with a hacks editor." (Self-perception and approach)
- "In part 13 there is a blue sun flower. She's sad and that's causing rain to happen all around her... You can cure their sadness by paying Bowser's Builders to rebuild the houses... she turns yellow, spawns a star, and the rain stops." (Example of integrated game design)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Beyond being "Yoshi's Island" in 3D, what are the core experiential goals? What specific elements or feelings from the original is he trying to capture or evolve?
- **Overworld Design Philosophy:** Explore the journey of designing the 360-degree interconnected overworld. What were the biggest challenges and "aha!" moments in making it feel cohesive and encourage exploration? How does he decide which of the "so many ideas" make the cut?
- **The "Rain Flower" Star as a Case Study:** Delve deeper into the design process for this specific star. How does this exemplify his approach to making secrets meaningful and transformative for the game world?
- **Collaboration and Community:** Since specific key collaborators for RTMI weren't mentioned here, ask about their roles if they are involved (Badub, Biobak, Zeina). How does he generally approach collaboration and incorporate community feedback or ideas into his projects?
- **The Future of Kaze Emanuar's Mods and Game Development:** Discuss his strong opinions on PC porting (static recompilation). What would an ideal PC version of "Return to Yoshi's Island" look like, and how does this project fit into his longer-term ambitions for commercial game development?

## Game Development Process
- **Audio Optimization:** Significant progress in refactoring audio code, achieving at least a 12.5% speed-up, with further improvements ongoing.
- **Overworld Development:** Actively planning overworld events and stars. The current goal is 180 total stars, with 21 in the overworld (11 planned, 10 more needed during this stream). The overworld is considered a critical and large level requiring perfection.
- **Content Creation:** Brainstorming and designing numerous secret stars and NPC interactions for the overworld, aiming to make it feel "alive." This includes ideas like NPCs from levels visiting the overworld, Yoshi-specific stars (house rebuilding, harvesting, egg hatching), and unique character appearances (Goomba King, Mole Blacksmith).
- **Beta Testing:** Regularly conducting beta tests for individual levels (e.g., Course 3, Course 11) by sending ROMs to testers. This process is yielding many minor improvements and validating design choices.
- **Level Integration:** Integrating contributor levels (e.g., AzaEasy's Course 11) into the overworld structure.
- **Technical Exploration:** Investigating new animation formats (referred to as "Cauterinian animations") to support features like squash and stretch, which are not natively supported by the Mario 64 engine.
- **Iterative Design:** Employing a drafting process for the hub world to manage layout, compactness, and player pathing, allowing for easy adjustments.

## Personal Insights
- **Perfectionism and Ambition:** Kaze expresses a strong desire to make the overworld "perfect" and "as alive as possible," willing to expand scope (e.g., considering up to 200 stars) to achieve this vision.
- **Design Philosophy:** Believes new game elements (like visiting NPCs) must have a clear "purpose," often tied to rewards like stars. He also shared his "critics' dilemma" theory, reflecting his analytical approach to game design and player enjoyment.
- **Engine Engagement:** Shows a deep understanding of the SM64 engine's capabilities and limitations, actively working to push its boundaries or find workarounds.
- **Openness to Ideas:** Willing to consider and integrate ideas from the community and collaborators if they align with the game's goals.

    - **"rhtc or from her discord":** Source of an idea for NPCs from worlds visiting the overworld.
    - **Beta Testers:** Unnamed individuals providing feedback on individual levels.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Interactivity:** A major focus is making the overworld dynamic, with NPCs from various courses appearing and offering star opportunities.
- **Star Design:** Extensive brainstorming for unique and engaging star concepts, such as the Yoshi egg hatching over real game time, a harvesting minigame, or the Goomba King fishing.
- **NPC Purpose:** Insistence that any NPC appearing in the overworld must have a functional role, preferably tied to a star.
- **Hub World Layout:** Addressing the challenge of making the hub world compact and minimizing "unnecessary walking" through iterative drafting.
- **Engine Limitations (Animation):** The SM64 engine's lack of native support for squash and stretch is a recognized challenge, with potential new animation formats being considered as a solution.
- **Visual Cohesion and "Juiciness":** Striving for a vibrant and appealing visual style, discussing how to improve less "juicy" areas, and considering new graphics combiners.
- **Connectivity:** Designing elements to create a sense of a connected world, e.g., a cave near Rainbow Grotto offering a view into the level or containing thematic elements like crystals.
- **Player Guidance/Secrets:** Designing secret stars in the overworld cave that might involve carrying a light source or navigating in the dark, balancing challenge with discoverability.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization (Indirect):** Mentions YouTube sponsorships (Squarespace) and a merchandise store ("rambus mug") as sources of income that support his work.
- **Potential PC Port Considerations:** Aware of legal/technical issues with proprietary N64 microcode (F3DEX3) if a PC port were ever considered, noting that microcode emulation would bypass this for a PC version.
- **Marketing (Humorous):** Satirically discusses the idea of using chatbot farms to generate online discourse and promote the game.

## Game Development Process
-   Currently in the "overworld drafting" phase, focusing on designing events and secret stars.
-   Significant effort recently dedicated to "fixing up Mario 64's audio engine," which Kaze describes as a major refactoring task.
-   The "first draft of all levels is done."
-   Remaining major tasks before release include: finishing the overworld, completing the sound engine refactor, refactoring the operating system, conducting beta tests for every level, incorporating beta testing feedback, waiting for Biobak to finish level reworks, creating side levels, and a "big round of bug fixes."
-   The game is planned to have around 180 stars, with potential to increase to 200. Currently, 177 stars are planned.
-   Kaze is tracking down a bug that only appears after the N64 has been running for six and a half days.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses strong negative opinions about the original Mario 64 audio engine, calling it "fucked" and "dogshit," believing it was poorly written and overly redundant.
-   He believes that simply adding many cool mechanics does not necessarily result in a good game: "I Know it is tempting to look at the game you're making and to be like Let's throw in every cool mechanic that I know of But I don't think that gets you a good game."
-   He acknowledges the challenges and frustrations of development, describing the audio code refactoring as something that's "gonna drive me insane."
-   Kaze is aware of potential backlash from the Nintendo community for criticizing Mario 64: "If I make a video called the Mario 64 audio system is fucked, people will fucking kill me."
-   He finds some YouTube comments annoying: "Dude the comments under my newest video have been so annoying God I need to strangle someone."

    -   The composer for the "Return to Yoshi's Island" OST.
    -   Has created "almost 20 songs for the overworld" ("RTYI overworld pack") designed to transition seamlessly into each other.
    -   Has also created "a shit ton of sound effects" for the overworld (e.g., rain, seagulls, jungle, creature, ocean waves).
    -   Kaze listens to Badoob's compositions during the stream to see if they fit the overworld.
-   **Biobak (Biobank):**
    -   A graphics artist involved in "level reworks." The team is waiting for Biobak to finish these.
    -   Kaze discusses ideas with Biobak, for example, for a "conspiracy Yoshi house level" which Biobak had apparently made.
    -   Mentioned in the context of a potential "bonus level" (Bowser's yacht).
-   **Zeina (Zayna):**
    -   Works on animations and detailed level work.
    -   "One area in Course 13 missing because Zeyna wanted to work on it. And she has been putting a lot of detail on there."
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Death Wizard:** Mentioned for creating a bug sheet detailing issues with the Mario 64 audio engine across different game versions (JP, US, PAL, Shindou).
    -   **Okayo:** Kaze's video editor. Mentioned in the context of making YouTube content creation easier.
    -   **Squarespace:** A sponsor for Kaze's YouTube videos, indirectly supporting the project's funding.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Overworld Design:**
    -   Focus on creating numerous events and secret stars to make the overworld feel alive.
    -   Aiming for approximately 50,000 polygons for the overworld.
    -   Music will fade into each other seamlessly when moving between areas.
    -   Overworld events are intended to have permanent effects (e.g., Yoshi farmer planting a Piranha Plant after Shy Guys attack).
-   **Star Count:** Debating between 180 (current plan) and 200 stars for the final game, with Kaze noting it's easy to add more lower-quality secret stars.
-   **Audio System:**
    -   Using a mix of streamed music (sounds better, performs better, but large file size) and sequenced music for the game's ~120 songs.
    -   Major undertaking to refactor the original Mario 64 audio engine due to its perceived flaws and inefficiencies (e.g., "float multiplication with a value close to one on every single node... every single audio tick").
-   **Day/Night Cycle:** Considered for the overworld but rejected due to the difficulty of implementing it well (dynamically changing vertex colors) and lack of clear purpose, despite acknowledging its coolness in games like Majora's Mask.
-   **Character Reappearance & Development:** Characters from levels may reappear in the overworld with new dialogues or roles after level completion (e.g., Boshi having a character arc).
-   **Feature Creep:** Kaze is wary of adding features just because they are cool, preferring a focused design.
-   **Technical Limitations:** Working within N64 constraints, dealing with bugs like one that takes 6.5 days to manifest.
-   **Player Guidance:** Designing intuitive ways for players to find secrets or progress (e.g., the Elder Yoshi in the dojo providing hints).
-   **Item-Carrying Missions:** Generally avoided as Kaze believes "carrying items just isn't fun."

## Business Aspects
-   **Funding:** The project is supported through Kaze's YouTube content, which includes sponsorships (e.g., Squarespace) and allows him to "pay the people that help me."
-   **Marketing/Distribution:** The game will be distributed as a patch. Kaze's YouTube videos about the development also serve as a form of marketing.
-   **Nintendo Takedown Contingency:**
    -   Kaze is aware of the risk of Nintendo issuing a cease and desist.
    -   His stated plan if this happens: "I will remove Mario from the game. And the Goombas. And the Yoshis. And I will make them my own characters. And then instead of a romhack, I will release a video game."
    -   He jokingly (and perhaps half-seriously) considers the PR and financial potential of a legal battle with Nintendo, referencing Epic Games vs. Apple.
    -   He notes that out of over a hundred projects, only one game (The Missing Link, not a Mario hack) and some videos were taken down, and videos he fought for were reinstated.

## Key Quotes
-   "The more I read it [Mario 64's audio engine] the more I realize this whole thing is fucked And I need to improve it, and I'm working on improving it, and it's slowly getting better." (Shows dedication to improving core aspects)
-   "our mission is to come up with more events and secret stars for the overworld... I'm thinking maybe we just say fuck it and put 40 secret stars in your world." (Illustrates the brainstorming and scope definition for the overworld)
-   "I Know it is tempting to look at the game you're making and to be like Let's throw in every cool mechanic that I know of But I don't think that gets you a good game." (Kaze's game design philosophy)
-   "In a Season Assist [Cease and Desist], what will you do? I will remove Mario from the game. And the Goombas. And the Yoshis. And I will make them my own characters. And then instead of a romhack, I will release a video game." (Contingency plan for Nintendo action)

## Game Development Process
- Kaze is currently working on the overworld for "Return to Yoshi's Island," focusing on layout, adding key locations (Yoshi village, Bowser's drill site), and brainstorming ways to fill empty spaces.
- A major ongoing task has been a complete overhaul of the Mario 64 sound engine, which Kaze has been working on for 4-5 days non-stop, resulting in significant performance improvements, reduced code size, and bug fixes.
- The overworld layout is mostly complete, with current efforts focused on detailing and adding interactive elements.
- Kaze is actively brainstorming and planning numerous "single mechanic levels" – shorter side levels designed to reuse existing gameplay mechanics to efficiently increase the game's total star count (aiming for around 200 stars).
- Specific levels are being debugged and iterated upon, such as "Grins and Badland," which Kaze identifies as needing significant changes to improve player guidance.
- Progress is also tracked for levels being worked on by collaborators, like Marty's "Green Japanese Garden" and Zeno's work on "Forgotten Fortress."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is highly self-critical of his work in progress, often stating that unfinished areas look like "absolute garbage" and managing expectations.
- He expresses a pragmatic and resilient attitude towards the possibility of a cease and desist, stating, "If it happens, it happens. It's not the end of the world. I can still just turn it into my own branded game, hopefully."
- He shares strong opinions on various topics, such as his dislike for the original Mario 64 sound engine ("It sucks") and websites like Reddit ("a website for losers").
- Kaze appears very busy and somewhat stressed by his workload, frequently mentioning having "so much stuff to do."
- He values efficiency in development, preferring to reuse existing mechanics for new content rather than creating entirely new complex systems for small side levels.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** While Badub isn't mentioned by name in a work context, Kaze confirms the need for an original soundtrack: "OST? Yes, we need an OST." This suggests music is a planned component.
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** Kaze mentions, "We're limited on bio back time though," indicating Biobak is a graphics artist whose available time is a constraint on development.
- **Zeina (Animations):** No relevant information found in this transcript regarding Zeina's contributions.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Marty:** "Marty is still working on it [Green Japanese Garden side level]."
    - **Zeno:** "Forgotten Fortress doesn't even have star names yet because we're still waiting for Zeno to finish the last area."
    - **Zell:** "I paid zell to make some changes to missing link" (referring to a separate project/tool, but shows collaboration).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Sound Engine Overhaul:** A major decision was to rip out and remake the Mario 64 sound engine due to its perceived flaws, aiming for better performance, smaller size, and easier game development.
- **Overworld Design & Cohesion:** Challenges include logically placing key elements (e.g., "Boshi's platform is here, but then Bill's drill is here. And Boshi being right next to the drill is all awkward"), visually representing concepts like a magical barrier around Bowser's drill, and filling large empty areas with meaningful content like a Yoshi playground or hospital.
- **Scope Management for Side Levels:** Kaze actively decides against overly complex new side levels: "The issue I have with it is it's too much work... I want the side levels that we now add to the project to be side levels that are based on a mechanic we already have." This led to the concept of "single mechanic levels."
- **Level Flow and Player Guidance:** Identified issues with the "Grins and Badland" level, where players struggle to find objectives, requiring a redesign. "You enter the level and you kind of have no fucking idea what to do."
- **Implementing New Ideas:** Brainstorming and problem-solving for new level concepts, such as how to make a hide-and-seek level engaging or how an egg-rolling/pinball mechanic would work and fit thematically.
- **Technical Implementation Details:** Briefly touches on issues like getting a temporary skybox to render correctly ("Why is RenderInfo.bg missing now?").

## Business Aspects
- **YouTube Monetization & Sponsorships:** Kaze is working with an agency called LFI to secure sponsorships for his YouTube videos. This is a primary reason for his increased video production: "That's the reason I'm making videos now, because I have sponsors and I need to make videos."
- **Agency Issues:** He is experiencing problems with the agency regarding payments and sales tax: "Something's fucked up, and now I don't know whether I'm actually going to get paid or not, which would be devastating." And, "They're not properly paying sales tax. Apparently."
- **Open Source Release:** Kaze plans to release "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI) as open source: "Will rtyi be open source on release yes definitely i do want people to use my engine to make more romhacks and to improve on my performance optimizations."
- **Small Scale Monetization:** Kaze mentions doing a product review on his second channel in exchange for a free smartphone.

## Key Quotes
- "Basically, I'm trying to fix Mario 64 sound engine. It sucks. I'm kind of just ripping it out, making my own. And it's been a serious effort."
- "The world is done layout-wise, yes... So here's where the detailing work comes in. We need to think of things we want on the island."
- "If anything I want the side levels that we now add to the project to be side levels that are based on a mechanic we already have. That is fun to re-experience and that are pretty short."
- "Are you scared that they will take down the game? No. I mean, they might, but like... If it happens, it happens. It's not the end of the world. I can still just turn it into my own branded game, hopefully."

## Potential Interview Topics
- The motivations and technical deep-dive behind the Mario 64 sound engine overhaul and its impact on "Return to Yoshi's Island."

## Game Development Process
- **Sound Engine Remake:** A major focus of recent work has been a complete remake of the Mario 64 sound engine. This new engine is stated to be around 80% faster, use a quarter of the code size, require less memory, and support 32 notes instead of 16, allowing for more complex music. It's intended to make bug fixing and adding new sound effects easier.
- **Overworld Development:** Significant effort is being put into designing and refining the game's overworld, described as "the biggest level ever" with potentially "like 30 stars." The process is iterative, with Kaze using placeholder assets and making adjustments to layout, scale, and points of interest (e.g., Yoshi Village, Bowser's area, wool warehouse, flower garden, treehouses) on stream. He mentions sketching levels first.
- **Full Game Release:** Kaze states, "I don't think there will be another demo. The next release will be the full game." This indicates the project is progressing towards completion.
- **Optimization:** While the sound engine remake yields significant optimization, Kaze notes that optimization became a public focal point somewhat incidentally. He continues to work on performance, including addressing issues like unnecessary triangles in meshes, though some are kept for future editability.
- **Texture and Visuals:** Work is ongoing on custom textures and visual refinement. Placeholder visuals are common during the layout phase. Kaze is experimenting with texture combiners and UV mapping to achieve the desired look, particularly for natural elements like mountains and sand.
- **Mechanics:** The overworld will feature "tons of new mechanics." No specific mechanic-based minigames are left to decide, but ideas are welcome.

## Personal Insights
- **On Optimization Perception:** "I don't know, it's kind of weird to me that this whole project became so much about optimization in the public eye. But I guess it was bound to happen. That's just what did well on YouTube, and that's why I kept engaging with that."
- **Game Design Philosophy (Post-Game):** "You know what I kind of don't like in video games? The fact that you spend the whole video game saving the world. But then once you save the world, you're not allowed to explore the saved world... I think I want to change that... I want the player to save the world and then be like, yep, this is the world now. You saved it."
- **Work Ethic & Time Management:** "Honestly, it's not that hard to find time for this stuff. If you think about your day-to-day, I'm sure you'll find that you waste most of your free time."
- **Critique of Other Projects:** Kaze expresses criticism of the Hackamari64 project, citing "weird decisions," difficulty integrating his code, and not keeping vanilla parity despite that being a stated goal.
- **Confidence in Completion:** "But so far I've always finished my hacks. So I'm very confident this one is going to get done soon."

## Collaborator Information
- **OVALT (Composer - likely Badub):**
    - "And this is the current version that 0VALT is working on right now."
    - OVALT is working on numerous songs for the game ("This is just one of like 15 songs," "I do made around 12 OVALT songs").
    - The overworld music will be dynamic: "The song is going to fade whenever you walk to a different area. So the OVALT is going to be insanely full and sprawling with music."
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):**
    - "Biobank is making a lot of custom textures but not literally every texture is custom."
    - "There's still so many levels for Biobank to rework."
    - Biobak provided a UV mapping plugin for Blender that Kaze uses: "I need the UV mapping plugin that Biobank sent me a couple days ago."
- **Zeina (Animator - Kaze's wife, also known as Zaynab):**
    - No specific information about Zeina's animation contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" is present in this transcript. Her name (Zena/Zaynab) is mentioned in a personal context regarding Kaze's move to Canada.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **DeathWizard:** Mentioned for creating a MIDI sequence that functions as the game Tetris within Mario 64's music format.
    - **Draco:** Kaze mentions "Draco's Mario" as a commission he finished and is waiting for commissioner approval to release. (Not directly RTYI).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Custom Sound Engine:** Decision to create a new sound engine for improved performance, flexibility in adding sounds/music, and easier bug fixing.
    - *Challenge:* Ongoing sound bugs ("During this stream, you might hear some sound bugs. I am still working on fixing those.").
- **Persistent Post-Game World:** A design goal is for the world to remain "saved" after the player completes the game, allowing continued exploration without resetting progress.
- **Overworld Layout & Density:**
    - *Decision:* Create a very large overworld with many stars and distinct areas.
    - *Challenge:* Filling large spaces effectively to avoid them feeling empty or uninteresting. "But also, we don't want a lot of empty space. So we need to do something." "This is still large and empty. And it sucks."
    - *Solution:* Iterative placement of elements like villages, geographical features (mountains), themed areas (Boshi's target practice, flower farm, treehouses, wool warehouse), and connecting paths.
- **Visuals and N64 Limitations:**
    - *Challenge:* Achieving desired visual detail and aesthetics (e.g., sand texture, mountain appearance) within the N64's technical constraints, particularly with texture formats like I4 leading to color quantization. "The problem is not the color curve, the problem is that I4 has very coarse colors... all this detail is going to be lost to quantization."
    - *Solution:* Experimenting with texture combiners, UV mapping techniques, and custom texture creation to overcome these limitations and improve visual fidelity.
- **RNG Improvement:** Kaze is working on a video about improving RNG in Mario 64, aiming for a "perfect random function" potentially using "real-world entropy" (like temperature). This will likely be implemented in the game.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Strategy:**
    - "The next release will be the full game." No more demos.
    - Release timing is critical: "The thing is I can't release this around the same time as Nintendo releases anything. And I also can't announce a release date around the same time Nintendo releases anything. Because if I do they will literally kill me."
- **Monetization/Funding (Indirectly for Project):**
    - Kaze creates YouTube videos, some of which are sponsored. "It is because I find sponsors and sponsors make videos for us and will pay you a lot of money. So I'm like, okay, I'll make the video. I want the money." This likely supports his ability to dedicate time to projects like RTYI.
- **Legality/Distribution:**
    - Awareness of legal issues regarding assets: "if I want this to all be legal, I would technically need custom textures for everything. But that's something for later if I actually do want to make this a legal game or something." This suggests a potential long-term goal of a fully original asset release.
- **Marketing:**
    - YouTube videos serve as a form of marketing and progress update. Kaze discusses thumbnail and title ideas for upcoming videos.
    - Content for videos is sometimes guided by what performs well on YouTube (e.g., optimization videos).

## Key Quotes
- "But having our own custom sound engine means it will be a lot easier to fix bugs and address issues and add new things and stuff." (Explaining the rationale for a major technical overhaul)
- "I think it would be extremely cool if in this game, for a change, after you save the world, it doesn't reset your save file. It's just you are in the world and the world is saved. And now you're free to do whatever you want." (Highlighting a core, innovative design goal)
- "The thing is I can't release this around the same time as Nintendo releases anything... Because if I do they will literally kill me." (On the practical constraints of releasing a fan project)
- "Yes, everything you see right now is placeholder. As we try to figure out the best way to do this overworld." (Emphasizing the iterative nature of the development process)

## Game Development Process
- **Audio Engine Rewrite:** Kaze recently spent a week rewriting Mario 64's audio engine, making it more memory-efficient, adding new capabilities, and ensuring he understands the entire codebase for easier debugging. It's now "mostly all my own code," except for the RSP interfacing.
- **Overworld Development:** Current work is focused on the overworld for "Return to Yoshi's Island." Sand and wall textures have been selected. The stream focuses on creating water effects and selecting wood textures.
- **Iterative Feature Implementation:** The development of water effects is shown as a highly iterative process, involving conceptualization, coding, testing in-game, debugging, and visual/parameter refinement.
- **Asset Creation/Selection:** Kaze is actively choosing and implementing textures and materials for the game environment.
- **Performance and Limitations:** Constant awareness of N64 limitations (e.g., triangle counts for water), but also a willingness to push them. The game is targeted for 64MB.

## Personal Insights
- **Motivation:** Kaze's primary motivation for "Return to Yoshi's Island" is simple: "I like Yoshi."
- **Ownership and Understanding:** He values having rewritten the audio engine himself as it makes debugging easier and gives him a sense of ownership, especially if the project were to be an "own game."
- **Reflection on Modding Community:** Kaze offers candid thoughts on the N64 modding community's history, particularly regarding console compatibility and its perception within the broader homebrew scene.
- **Development Enjoyment:** He expresses satisfaction when visual elements come together well ("This looks very nice, holy shit," "This looks cool as fuck").
- **Openness to Experimentation:** Kaze shows a willingness to try unconventional ideas, even if they might seem complex ("What if this wasn't floating on wooden posts, but rather on rubber duckies?").

## Collaborator Information
- Badub: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Biobak: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Zeina: No relevant information found in this transcript.
- Other Contributors:
    - **Robart:** Mentioned as the creator of a different ROM hack ("Yoshi's tropical paradise") whose textures Kaze references for inspiration. Not explicitly a collaborator on "Return to Yoshi's Island."
    - **Community (General):** Kaze acknowledges a viewer's offer to contribute textures ("Dude, I definitely could use some textures"), but expresses uncertainty about how to manage individual contributions for specific assets.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Water Effects:** A significant portion of the stream is dedicated to designing and implementing dynamic water waves for a "tropical beach" feel. This involves:
    - **Challenge:** Making waves look good, directional (coming into the island), and interact well with swimming mechanics without looking "weird."
    - **Solutions Explored/Implemented:** Sine waves, considering Wind Waker/Mario Sunshine/Wave Race 64 styles (mostly dismissed for various reasons), hex tessellation, texture scrolling, vertex manipulation for wave motion and height, dynamic vertex coloring for depth, and creating a curvature to the wave front.
    - **Challenge:** Performance cost of complex waves (e.g., Gerstner waves deemed too expensive).
- **Console Compatibility:** "Return to Yoshi's Island" (referred to as "Yoshi Garden version" by a chatter) is "very unlikely" to have full N64 console compatibility. This is due to historical tool limitations and a past lack of focus on console compatibility in the N64 modding scene.
- **Overworld Design:** The game aims for an "open zone" feel for the overworld, without loading zones.
- **Aesthetics vs. Gameplay:** Kaze grapples with balancing visually impressive effects (like high waves) with practical gameplay implications (Mario clipping or swimming awkwardly).
- **Texture Tiling:** Uses noise textures to mitigate obvious tiling patterns on surfaces like wood.
- **Future Water Features:** Plans to add foam near the shore, with opacity linked to wave dynamics.

## Business Aspects
- **Legal Considerations for Originality:** Kaze mentions that his rewritten audio engine is "mostly all my own code." He notes that the Nintendo RSP interface code would need to be remade "in our own words" if "we made this like our own game," indicating an awareness of intellectual property for potential independent release.
- **No Confirmed Commercial Plans:** A chatter asks about the game "becom[ing] a selling game compound," but Kaze does not confirm any such plans in his response, focusing instead on his personal motivation.

## Key Quotes
- "So, over the past week I spent a lot of time completely rewriting Mario 64's audio engine... It's also all my own code now. Or well, mostly all my own code... So I think we're fine legally to just use this in our own game now."
- "What brought you to the return of the island idea, like when it becomes a selling game compound? I like Yoshi. That's kind of where the thought process ended."
- "The main problem with the water is that if we add waves to it, swimming in it is going to be weird... But yeah the problem I have with it is Mario in the water is looking very rough so we do have to disable the waves around Mario."
- "Yep, I like this a lot now. I think something like this is what we were looking for... Now the waves actually look properly going into the island. It looks very tropical."

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Vision for "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Beyond "I like Yoshi," explore the core design philosophy, intended player experience, and what Kaze hopes to achieve with this specific project, especially regarding its "open zone" nature.
- **Audio Engine Rewrite Deep Dive:** Discuss the technical and creative motivations behind rewriting the audio engine, the challenges involved, and its specific benefits for "Return to Yoshi's Island" and potential future original projects.
- **Balancing Ambition and Constraints:** Explore Kaze's process for navigating N64 limitations while striving for advanced visual effects like the detailed water, and how he makes trade-offs between visual fidelity, performance, and gameplay.
- **Console Compatibility and the Modding Scene:** Delve into his decision regarding console compatibility, his perspective on the evolution of the N64 modding community, and the role of the Mario 64 decompilation in current projects.
- **Collaboration and Future Originality:** Clarify the roles of named collaborators (Badub, Biobak, Zeina) if they are involved, and further discuss his thoughts on the path from ROM hacking to potentially creating and distributing "our own game" legally and commercially.

    -   **Miamek:** Gave Kaze advice regarding reworks, influencing Kaze's decision to proceed with certain changes: "That's true, Miamek, because you told me that it's fine to do that, and because you told me you had good ideas for it."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Sound System Enhancement:** Kaze is working on a major feature to allow "two sound effects per bank can play at the same time," aiming to "seriously improve the sound effect quality." This has been "quite nasty to say the least."
-   **Water Foam Implementation:** A significant portion of the stream is dedicated to designing and implementing water foam effects. This involves decisions on UV mapping, vertex alpha, texture scrolling, matching foam to wave vertices, and making waves flatter near the shore. Challenges include pre-calculating wave height with limited vertex data storage.
-   **"Booloth" Sound Mystery:** Kaze explains his theory that the low-pitched "booloth" sound in BigBoo's Haunt (Mario 64) is part of the wind sound effect, revealed when the sound effect is cancelled or plays in full under specific conditions (like going through a door).
-   **Emulator Compatibility:** Kaze expresses significant frustration with the Parallel emulator, citing bugs that affected past RTYI releases and general usability issues. He prefers PJ64 1.6 for his own testing despite known vulnerabilities.
-   **Tooling and Engine Features:**
    -   Blender issues: Encountered a problem with a "UDIM" error preventing texture loading, and difficulties with UV mapping.
    -   Material Labels: Kaze discusses the need for material labels in the engine/tooling for shader work, expressing frustration with alternative "dogshit segment idea[s]."
-   **Graphics and Shaders:** Kaze works on improving shaders for objects like palm trees to achieve a "sun-kissed" look and better contrast.
-   **Memory Management:** Discusses a bug with the Parallel emulator where "you couldn't use the last byte in memory because of an off by one error," which affected his decompression routine.

## Business Aspects
-   **Release Date:** No projected release date is given; Kaze tells viewers, "You're gonna have to wait." and "Shouldn't be this hard to wait."
-   **Project Contingency:** Kaze has measures in place in case something happens to him: "There's like 10 people that have access to Return to Yoshi's Island. I also have a private repo with all the assets, so nothing would be lost if I died."
-   **Potential for Full-Time Development:** Kaze states he would "for sure, yes" work on game development full-time if he had enough patrons to support him.
-   **Monetization/Distribution:** No specific plans for selling the game are mentioned, but a hypothetical "What if I finished the game and then asked people to donate $50,000 before I release it?" is posed humorously. The project is a ROM hack, which typically has limitations on commercial distribution.
-   **Community Engagement:** The stream itself and Kaze's interactions with chat serve as a form of community engagement and progress update.

## Key Quotes
-   "Basically what I'm trying to do is make it so that two sound effects per bank can play at the same time. This would seriously improve the sound effect quality across the board." (Highlights a significant technical goal for RTYI)
-   "Well, Biobank is probably going to change it anyway, so don't worry if you don't like it right now. I'm not trying to put too much work into this, just like get this semi-decent looking, so Biobank doesn't puke when he sees this." (Illustrates the collaborative workflow and Kaze's iterative approach to graphics)
-   "There's like 10 people that have access to Return to Yoshi's Island. I also have a private repo with all the assets, so nothing would be lost if I died. But it's not like I am dying, so please, calm down." (Shows foresight for project preservation and a glimpse into his personal life concerns)
-   "The problem with me making a Mario World tag is that I don't like Mario World... And I wouldn't want to work on a game that brings me no joy." (Reveals Kaze's personal motivation and criteria for project selection)

## Potential Interview Topics
1.  **The Genesis of RTYI and Technical Ambitions:** Explore the initial inspiration for "Return to Yoshi's Island" and the decision to undertake significant engine enhancements (like the sound system) rather than working within the original SM64 limitations.
2.  **Collaborative Dynamics:** Delve deeper into the working relationships with Biobak (graphics), Zeina (visuals/animations), and the informal but crucial technical support from community members like Lila. How does this collaborative model shape the game?

## Game Development Process
- The game is actively in development, with a significant focus on creating and refining the overworld environment.
- Current tasks involve texture work (sand, grass, paths, rocks), implementing water effects (waves, foam), creating decal layers, and integrating interactive elements.
- Kaze mentions working on a "decal layer of sand" and making the overworld "feel alive" by having it change throughout the game.
- The process is iterative, with Kaze building foundational elements that collaborators like Biobank will later refine. He states, "What I'm doing is not the final version. I'm just getting something like semi decent going. So then when Biobank starts working on this, he has a good starting point."
- Future scope includes "side levels" to be developed after the overworld.
- Debugging technical issues (e.g., infinite loops, rendering bugs with Fast64, audio problems) is a significant part of the daily development work.
- Kaze is working on specific mechanics, such as interactive coconuts on palm trees that can drop coins or be used to interact with NPCs.
- There's an ongoing effort to optimize code and manage N64 hardware limitations, as seen in discussions about `const` usage and linked list implementations.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze expresses strong opinions on programming methodologies, such as his statement: "Lying to the compiler to make the compiler produce more optimized code is something I very commonly do."
- He reflects on the nature of game art and fidelity, questioning if increased realism detracts from what makes games "special": "Do you guys think that the increase in fidelity that games in general have received has inevitably taken away something that makes games special...?"
- Kaze views himself as open to correction if proven wrong but is confident in his knowledge: "I'm someone who doesn't really take any issue with being corrected. I just care about becoming as good as possible."
- He shows a passion for technical challenges and finding optimal solutions, evident in the lengthy `const` debate.
- He appreciates community interaction and feedback but ultimately makes decisions based on his own judgment and technical understanding.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Composer):** While not explicitly named in this transcript, Kaze discusses "OST wishes," an "updated song for course," and issues with his "audio engine." Chat members react to new music. This implies a composer (identified as Badub by the prompt) is involved or Kaze is managing musical aspects. He mentions, "we updated the song for course so it is a new song slightly new."
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** Kaze is preparing the overworld for Biobak to work on its graphical fidelity. "What I'm doing is not the final version. I'm just getting something like semi decent going. So then when Biobank starts working on this, he has a good starting point." Biobak also seems to provide input on visual elements like foam.
- **Zeina (Animations/Assets):** Zeina provides assets like bunny footprints, and Kaze gives iterative feedback: "Oh, I see. I need multiple of them in a path, Zayna. Can you put like maybe four or five of them on one texture?" Zayna is also humorously mentioned in connection with a "funky palette."
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Laila:** Associated with a "random mode bug." Kaze mentions, "I hope Laila joins so we can yell at her for the random mode bug."
    - **Marty:** Has worked on a palette system that Kaze has yet to import: "Marty is working on this either is basically done, but I haven't been able to import it yet."
    - **Sauron:** Is working on a technical component for the rendering pipeline: "Sauron is working on a version of the legacy vertex pipeline that enables Fresno like a flag a set."

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Visuals & Aesthetics:**
    - Significant effort is put into getting textures (sand, grass, rocks) and their transitions right. Kaze experiments with colors and shaders.
    - Implementing realistic or stylized water effects (waves, foam) is a challenge: "Why is the water making foam on those rocks from the other sides of the waves?"
    - Lighting and N64 limitations for effects like light mapping are considered: "You can only have one UV mapper, I think. So if you did have a light map, it would have to have the same UVs, and that's so limiting that in practice you can say it can't do it."
- **Technical Challenges & Bugs:**
    - Frequent encounters with bugs, including infinite loops, rendering issues ("Fast64 bug"), and audio engine problems.
    - Understanding and working around engine limitations (e.g., "Yep, you're not allowed to increase the flags").
    - The extensive debate about the `const` keyword highlights the focus on optimization and compiler behavior.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
    - Designing interactive elements like coconuts: "All the coconut trees have coconuts. You can kick them to make them drop the coconuts that may have 0 to 5 coins in them. Some sleeping character you can conk with a coconut."
    - Creating a dynamic overworld: "The overworld changes throughout the game. It's supposed to feel alive."
    - Implementing visual cues for players, like bunny footprints leading to an area.
- **Level Design (Overworld):**
    - Iterative design of paths, terrain features (hills, cave entrances), and transitions between different surface types (sand to grass).
    - Balancing visual appeal with N64 performance capabilities (e.g., texture memory).

## Business Aspects
- **Release Date:** No specific release date is planned. Kaze states, "Well, there is no release date yet. So, like, what do you want me to do? I don't know when it releases. It gets done when it's done."
- **Funding/Marketing:** No explicit mention of funding, marketing strategies, or commercial distribution plans for "Return to Yoshi's Island." The project appears to be a passion-driven ROM hack.

## Key Quotes
- "The overworld changes throughout the game. It's supposed to feel alive." (Vision for the game's overworld)
- "Lying to the compiler to make the compiler produce more optimized code is something I very commonly do." (Kaze's programming philosophy)
- "What I'm doing is not the final version. I'm just getting something like semi decent going. So then when Biobank starts working on this, he has a good starting point." (Iterative development and collaboration)
- "It gets done when it's done." (Approach to project timeline and release)

## Potential Interview Topics
- Explore the collaborative workflow with Zayna, Biobank, Badub, and other contributors in a distributed ROM hacking environment. How are tasks assigned and integrated?
- Discuss Kaze's core game design philosophies for "Return to Yoshi's Island," particularly how he balances innovation with the foundational Mario 64 experience.
- Delve into the most significant technical or creative challenges faced during development (e.g., Fast64 bugs, audio engine, specific visual effects) and the process of overcoming them.
- Ask about Kaze's vision for the player experience, especially concerning the dynamic overworld and the unique mechanics being introduced.
- Investigate the impact of the Mario 64 decompilation project on Kaze's ability to create "Return to Yoshi's Island" and his personal motivations for undertaking such a large-scale ROM hack.

## Game Development Process
- Currently focusing on finishing shaders and base visuals for overworld sections, including corals, rocks, volcano, and cave areas.
- A level is being prepared for beta testing; Course 4 is being polished for this purpose (beta test described as sending ROM to one person).
- Core game design (level layout, "mapped out the board") was established earlier; current phase involves fleshing out these areas with visual details and specific ideas.
- Iterative work on textures and "combiners" (N64 shaders) to achieve desired N64 aesthetics.
- Addressing and fixing visual bugs as they arise (e.g., issues with decals, missing footprints).
- The project is limited to a 64-megabyte ROM size.
- Development involves reusing existing level elements and creating new assets like plants and flowers for specific areas like "Bunny Burrow."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze Emanuar expresses a desire for the overworld to feel "placey" (immersive and like a real location) rather than "gamey."
- He is candid about his own skills, feeling he has "no talent for art" but has improved, and considers himself a skilled programmer ("top 2% or 3%") though perhaps lacking in formal, broad knowledge.
- He holds strong opinions on the quality of the original Mario 64 C code (believing it to be "below average," with some exceptions like Goddard's work).
- Kaze enjoys the challenge of optimization and laments when it's overlooked, though he understands the modern game development trade-offs.
- He reflects on the commercialization of his YouTube channel as a necessity to fund his time and resources (like video editing) for projects.
- He mentions being significantly more productive on the game before having a full-time job and other responsibilities.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (composer):** Not explicitly mentioned as the composer for "Return to Yoshi's Island" in this transcript, though Kaze discusses the RTYI OST and the idea of potentially selling it, implying its existence.
- **Biobak (graphics artist, referred to as Biobank/Bioware in transcript):** Tasked with reworking and refining Kaze's initial visual work, particularly shaders and art assets, to achieve a higher level of polish. Kaze mentions Biobak will "rework some of this anyway" and "make this look really good in the end."
- **Zeina (animations):** Kaze asks Zeina about progress on a "skip button" for cutscenes, indicating Zeina's involvement in implementing specific gameplay-related animation or UI features.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Akumoid:** Collaborated with Kaze on a reflective metallic shader used in another level, which Kaze considers using for the lighthouse in RTYI.
    - **Community (Fast64 Plugin):** The Blender plugin (Fast64) Kaze uses is primarily community-written.
    - **Fnatic:** Provided Kaze with a specific (private) version of an emulator.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Philosophy:** Prioritizing an immersive, "placey" feel over a "gamey" one, influencing decisions like not having Banjo-Kazooie style level nameplates.
- **NPC Interaction:** Designing interactive NPCs like Pachyderm (from Yoshi's Story) who blocks an entrance and can be bypassed either by paying coins or by ground-pounding, offering player choice.
- **Visuals and Aesthetics:** Significant time spent on selecting/creating textures, designing shaders (combiners) for N64, and iterating on visuals for various environmental elements (corals, volcano, caves, plants). Challenges include making textures look good despite N64 limitations ("This texture kind of looks like shit," "The edges, man").
- **Cutscene Experience:** Implementing a cutscene skip functionality (holding 'A' button to fill a circle) for player convenience.
- **Technical Constraints:** Constantly working within N64 hardware limitations (combiner complexity, texture memory, ROM size) is a major recurring challenge that shapes design and implementation.
- **Bug Fixing:** Dealing with engine bugs (e.g., clipping into slanted walls, a Mario 64 engine bug) and tool-related issues (e.g., Fast64 plugin exporting textures incorrectly).
- **Atmosphere:** Making areas like the "Bunny Burrow" entrance feel "friendly and inviting" to contrast with obstacles like Pachyderm.

## Business Aspects
- Kaze's YouTube channel is monetized through sponsors found via an agency, which helps pay for video editing and supports his ability to work on projects like RTYI. He acknowledges this has "commercialized" his channel.
- He briefly mentions the idea of buying samples for the Mario 64 OST if he were to "sell the RTYI OST," indicating a consideration, however speculative, of monetizing game assets.
- He openly discusses the ethics and reception of taking a gambling sponsorship on YouTube, weighing the financial benefits.
- No direct funding model for RTYI itself (like crowdfunding for the game directly) is detailed in this transcript, beyond the YouTube income supporting his time.

## Key Quotes
- "That makes the overworld feel very gamey and I want this to feel placey." - Kaze on his design philosophy for the overworld.
- "Our goal here is to throw together some shaders that work well, and put some ideas into here. So if it's not perfect for now, that is fine... So that Biobank can actually make this look really good in the end." - Kaze on the iterative development process and collaboration with Biobak.
- "skill-wise, I'm at least a top 2% or 3% programmer. Knowledge-wise, probably not. And I would say that, maybe I'm being an asshole here, but I would say that the code I've seen in Mario 64 is below average, unfortunately." - Kaze's reflection on his skills and the original game's code.

## Potential Interview Topics
- Exploration of the initial "mapping out the board" phase of RTYI's design and how that blueprint guides current development.
- Deeper dive into the collaborative workflow with Biobak, Zeina, and other contributors: communication, creative freedom, and how their input shapes the final game.
- Specific examples of overcoming N64 technical limitations to achieve a desired visual or gameplay effect in RTYI.
- Kaze's philosophy on what makes a good ROM hack, and how he balances innovation with faithfulness to the source material (Yoshi's Island and Mario 64).
- Discussion of the "annual carrot festival" and other lore elements designed to make the world of RTYI feel alive and inviting.
