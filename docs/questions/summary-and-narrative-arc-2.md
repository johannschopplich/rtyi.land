## Things I Missed / Further Considerations:

1.  **Playtesters (other than Zeina, if applicable):**

    - If there was a dedicated testing team or key community testers beyond Zeina, their perspective on the game's evolution, difficulty, and finding obscure bugs could be insightful.
    - _Question Example for a Tester:_ "You've seen RTYI evolve through many iterations. What was one of the most surprising changes or bug discoveries you encountered during testing?"

2.  **Tool Creators/Key Technical Collaborators (e.g., Soren, Lila):**

    - The generated questions for Kaze mention Soren (F3DEX3, Sec64, Soren's Trace) and Lila (Fast64 contributions, quaternion system) as providing pivotal tools or code. A short interview or statement from them could add a fascinating layer to the "Technical Feats & Nightmares" section.
    - _Question Example for Soren/Lila:_ "Your tool [F3DEX3/Fast64 contribution/Quaternion system] played a significant role in RTYI's development. Can you describe what it enables and the collaborative process of integrating it with Kaze's custom engine?"

3.  **The Broader SM64 Modding Community:**

    - While not direct interviews, perhaps intersperse the documentary with brief insights or reactions from notable figures in the SM64 modding scene about the impact/anticipation for RTYI. This could be gathered from existing online commentary or short, targeted questions.
    - _Topic to Explore:_ How does RTYI fit into the history and future of SM64 modding?

4.  **The "Why" of Retro Development:**

    - A deeper philosophical dive with all interviewees: In an age of hyper-realistic modern games, what is the enduring appeal of developing for and pushing the limits of 28-year-old hardware like the N64? What unique satisfaction does it bring?

5.  **The "Business" of Passion:**

    - Kaze touches on sponsorships and potential future monetization (of an original IP). Exploring the practical realities of funding such long-term, high-effort fan projects, even if they are ultimately free, could be a compelling narrative thread. How do creators sustain themselves?

6.  **Visual Storytelling through Gameplay:**
    - Encourage all interviewees to "show, don't just tell." When they describe a challenge or a feature, prompt them to relate it to what the player sees or experiences directly in the game. Since it's narrator-less, their descriptions will build the visual narrative for the audience. You can use gameplay footage to illustrate their points.

This comprehensive plan should provide a strong foundation for your interviews and the documentary's narrative. Remember to let the interviewees' passion and stories drive the film! Good luck!
