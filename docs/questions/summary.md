## Questions for Kaze Emanuar (Lead Developer, Programmer, Designer)

**Genesis & Vision:**

1.  You've worked on many SM64 projects. What was the specific catalyst or unique inspiration that made you decide "Return to Yoshi's Island" was the next major undertaking? Why Yoshi's Island, and what did you initially envision that was different from your past work?
2.  You've mentioned the game is "so unrecognizable from the demo." Can you walk us through some of the most pivotal transformations RTYI has undergone and the key decisions or breakthroughs that led to this evolution?
3.  Your design philosophy is quite distinct – "less is more" regarding player options, "excitement over difficulty," "positive frustration," making games that don't "waste your time." How have these principles directly shaped the core gameplay, level design, and overall player journey in RTYI?
4.  The overworld is clearly a passion project within the project, aiming for a massive, explorable, "YoshiShaped" island. What’s the grand vision behind this, and how are you balancing its ambitious scale with intuitive navigation and meaningful secrets?

**Technical & Creative Challenges:**

5.  Rewriting core SM64 systems (collision, audio, even a new OS) is a monumental task. What was the breaking point with the original systems that made you say, "I need to build this myself"? Could you share an example of how one of these custom systems fundamentally enabled a feature in RTYI that would have otherwise been impossible?
6.  You're famous for pushing the N64 to its limits. Can you describe one of RTYI's most audacious technical achievements (e.g., advanced lighting, F3DEX3 integration, performance on original hardware) and the sheer willpower and ingenuity required to make it work?
7.  Level design for you seems like an emotional rollercoaster, from ideas feeling like "dogshit" to "the best thing ever." Can you walk us through the lifecycle of a level like "Frantic Fleet Factory" or the "Cowboy Level," highlighting a moment of intense struggle and the subsequent breakthrough?
8.  The "64MB ROM limit" and "N64 authenticity" are constraints you embrace. How do these self-imposed limitations fuel your creativity versus becoming a frustration, especially when designing feature-rich levels or visually ambitious sequences?

**Collaboration & Community:**

9.  You work with a core team of artists and a composer. How do you foster a collaborative environment where their creative inputs can flourish while still guiding the project towards your singular vision? Can you give an example of how a collaborator's idea significantly enhanced RTYI?
10. You stream your development extensively, warts and all. How has this "thinking aloud" in front of an audience influenced your problem-solving, design choices, and even your motivation through the nearly three-plus years of development?
11. You have a unique perspective on community feedback: "what people feel... is real... But their reasoning is most of the time stupid." How does this philosophy guide how you filter and apply feedback to a community-centric project like a ROM hack?

**Legacy & Future:**

12. You plan to release RTYI and its engine as open source. What are your primary motivations for this, and what specific impact do you hope it will have on the SM64 modding community and future fan projects?
13. You've openly discussed the "Nintendo risk" and contingency plans like "Return to Dinosaur Island." How do you mentally and strategically navigate the development of such a high-profile fan game under this potential shadow?
14. Looking beyond RTYI, you've mentioned ambitions for original commercial titles. How has the intense, multifaceted experience of developing RTYI—from deep engine work to managing a team and community—prepared you for that next step?

## Questions for Biobak (Graphic Artist, Level Reworks, Design Input)
