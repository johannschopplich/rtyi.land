## 2. Specific Questions for Each Team Member

### Kaze Emanuar (Lead Developer, Programmer, Visionary)

_(Many of the stream-generated questions are excellent starting points, rephrased for a documentary context. I'll synthesize and expand.)_

**Genesis & Vision:**

1.  You've worked on many SM64 projects. What was the unique spark for "Return to Yoshi's Island"? Why this theme, and what was your initial grand vision?
2.  The game has been in development for nearly three years. What fuels your dedication through the "pure torture" phases you've described?
3.  You've said the final game is "unrecognizable from the demo." Can you walk us through some of the most pivotal transformations and the breakthroughs that led to them?
4.  Open Source: You plan to make RTYI fully open source. What are your primary motivations, and what legacy do you hope it leaves for the SM64 modding community?

**Design Philosophy & Process:**

5.  You have strong design philosophies: "less is more" regarding player options, "excitement over difficulty," "positive frustration," "placeness." Could you elaborate on one or two of these and show how they've concretely shaped a level or mechanic in RTYI?
6.  Tutorials were a big focus (e.g., "tutorial bunnies"). What's your philosophy on teaching players new, complex movements within N64 limitations, especially given ROM hack players have "no initial commitment"?
7.  Level Design:
    - Walk us through the conceptual journey of a specific level (e.g., "Frantic Fleet Factory," "Cowboy Level," "Craft Level," "Astral Arcade," or the Overworld). From initial idea, community brainstorming, to concrete mechanics and atmosphere.
    - You've mentioned the "shit phase" of level design. Can you describe that emotional and creative rollercoaster for a particular level? What was a moment it wasn't working, and what was the breakthrough?
    - The Overworld is a massive undertaking, described as "the most important part." What's your vision for making it a seamless, secret-filled, and evolving hub that ties the game together?
8.  "Making decisions is like the most important thing." Can you share a particularly tough design decision you faced for RTYI, how you navigated it, and its impact?
9.  You often brainstorm numerous ideas and use only a few. Describe your brainstorming process, especially for achieving originality and avoiding repetition.

5.  Describe your typical workflow: When Kaze provides a blockout or an early version of a level, how do you interpret his ideas and then transform them visually?
6.  Kaze praises your use of N64 combiners and your ability to create depth. Can you explain (in an accessible way) some techniques you use to push the N64's graphical boundaries for RTYI?
7.  The "craft aesthetic" is prominent. How did this visual style come about, and what are the challenges and joys of creating assets that fit this theme (e.g., paper, cardboard, styrofoam effects Kaze worked on based on your idea)?
8.  You provided the influential mockup for the 3D panorama star select screen. What was your thought process for that UI element, and how do you approach UI/UX design for an N64 game?

## 3. Things You Might Have Missed (Or to Probe Deeper On)

- **The "Decompilation Difference" in Detail:** While asked generally, for Kaze specifically: What _couldn't_ you have done in RTYI without the decomp? For the artists/composer: Does it grant them more freedom in practice (e.g., more animation frames, complex models, better sound quality) that Kaze can then implement?
- **Tooling:**
  - Kaze mentions Fast64, Blender, his own custom OS. What's the toolchain like for each member?
  - Biobak: What 3D modeling/texturing software? How does he prepare assets for Kaze's N64 pipeline?
  - Badub: What sequencers, sound libraries, or N64-specific music tools (like Sac64 Kaze mentioned)?
  - Zeina: What animation software? How are animations exported/converted for the N64?
- **Specific "Aha!" Moments or "Happy Accidents":** Any unexpected discoveries or bugs that turned into features? The documentary overview mentions this as a common theme.
- **Influence of Other Games/Media:** Beyond Yoshi's Island and SM64, what other games, art, or media inspired RTYI's design, art, or music? (Kaze mentioned _Majora's Mask_ for world-building, _Mario Party_ for an overworld theme, _Frozen/Adventure Time_ for ice castle inspiration).
- **The "Feel" of RTYI:** Kaze talks a lot about "game feel," "vibe," "placeness." Ask each contributor how _they_ interpret this and how their work contributes to it. For Kaze, how does he _achieve_ that feel through code and design?
- **Burnout and Motivation (Deeper Dive):** Kaze mentions it, but how does the _whole team_ manage motivation over such a long period, especially with volunteer contributions? What keeps them coming back?
- **Scope Creep vs. Refinement:** RTYI has evolved significantly. How does Kaze decide when a change is a necessary refinement versus scope creep? How does the team adapt to major reworks?
- **The "Why Yoshi's Island?" Question:** Probe deeper. What specific elements of Yoshi's Island (aesthetically, mechanically, tonally) did Kaze want to translate into a 3D SM64 experience? How did the team interpret this?
- **Individual Aspirations & RTYI's Role:** How do they see RTYI fitting into their personal creative journey or portfolio?
- **Favorite Unseen Thing:** Is there a small detail, a piece of code, an animation, a musical flourish, or an art asset that they're particularly proud of that players might not immediately notice, but that was challenging or rewarding to create?
- **The "Pressure" of Kaze's Reputation:** Does working with a well-known figure in the modding scene add any pressure or unique dynamics for the contributors?
- **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Encourage them to walk you through their work environment (if possible/remote setup) or show examples of their assets/code/music if relevant during the interview. This can be visual gold for a documentary. For Kaze, showing him debugging on actual N64 hardware or navigating his complex codebase. For Biobak, showing his 3D models. For Badub, his music software. For Zeina, her animation rigs.
