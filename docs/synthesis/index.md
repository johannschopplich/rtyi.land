# Documentary Prep

This section contains **curated, cross-stream synthesis** – focused briefings distilled from all stream analyses for documentary work.

::: tip How this works
Run `pnpm stream-synthesis` to generate synthesis files from the per-stream extraction data. The results are written to `.data/synthesis/` and loaded by these pages.

## Raw Data (Stream Archive)

The synthesis above is built from the per-stream extractions. You can always drill into the raw data:

- [Stream Dashboard](/streams/) – all streams overview
- [Stream Highlights](/streams/highlights) – pivotal & milestone streams
- [Raw Findings by Topic](/topics/) – every finding, every stream
- [Team Profiles](/team/) – per-person raw data across streams
