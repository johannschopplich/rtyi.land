# Biobak (Graphics Artist & Designer)

::: tip Introduction

You're the visual artist behind many RTYI levels – when people see those modern-looking environments running on N64 hardware, that's your work. Tell me about your role and what drives you to create such detailed worlds for 30-year-old hardware.

## On Visuals & World-Building

1.  We often see Kaze build a functional "blockout" version of a level to get the platforming right. Then later, we see your rework that completely transforms it. Can you walk me through your process? How do you take that basic layout and breathe life into it? Course 1, the Ghost Ship or Oily Boily Bay reworks are my favorite examples.

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Kaze's Reaction**: His "Holy shit, everything is different" (Ghost Ship) or "it looked poopy before" (Oily Boily Bay) reactions to your reworks.
    - **The Starting Point**: Receiving a level as a blockout or MS Paint map.
    - **Thematic Storytelling**: Finding the "bomb manufacturing process" narrative for the Bomb-Cap Factory.
    - **Creative Problem-Solving**: The ceiling becoming the light source in the factory.
    - **Iterative Process**: The back-and-forth on Oily Boily Bay, from volcano to oil rig, and finding the right color palette. The main office change from a full castle to a single tower.
    - **Performance Gains**: How your reworks often reduce triangle counts and materials while improving visuals.
    - **The Changelog**: The importance of your comprehensive changelogs for Kaze to integrate your work.

2.  You create these detailed, modern-looking levels, but they have to run on 30-year-old hardware. What's your process for modeling and texturing something beautiful while constantly battling N64 polycounts, texture limits, and memory constraints?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **High-Poly to Low-Poly**: Your process for creating detailed models optimized for the N64.
    - **The N64 Palette**: Creating visual richness within the limited color palette and texture memory.
    - **Optimization vs. Vision**: Balancing optimization with your artistic vision – a time you had to compromise.
    - **Creative Workarounds**: The story of the "Cursed Texture" and the 96x42 resolution fix for the ship sail.
    - **Hardware Defeats**: An idea that was too ambitious for the hardware.
    - **Surprising Successes**: An idea that worked despite the limitations, like the transparent water in Dino Dino Domain.

## On Collaboration & Creative Vision

1.  How does Kaze communicate what he's looking for in a level's art style? Does he give you reference images or describe a "vibe?" How do you translate that direction into a cohesive visual identity?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Translating the "Vibe"**: Turning Kaze's abstract "vibe" descriptions into a concrete visual identity.
    - **Blueprint to Beauty**: Your process for transforming Kaze's MS Paint maps into 3D environments.
    - **Live Feedback**: Your role in providing real-time feedback on colors and textures during Kaze's streams.
    - **Beyond Visuals**: Your role in suggesting gameplay improvements and new mechanics.
    - **Boss Battle Innovation**: Suggesting the destructible planet for the Course 15 boss fight.
    - **Naming Influence**: Pitching level names like "Oozing Oil Operation."
    - **Artistic Influence**: An artistic choice of yours that fundamentally changed a level's gameplay.

2.  Kaze often talks about creating "placeness", a sense that a level is a real, coherent environment. From your perspective as the artist, what does "placeness" mean? How do your level reworks, like for Oily Boily Bay or the Zoo, contribute to this goal beyond just making them "prettier"?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Environmental Storytelling**: Using environmental details like the "sexy brutalist architecture" to tell stories.
    - **N64 Atmosphere**: Creating compelling lighting and atmosphere on the N64.
    - **The "Biobak Rework"**: The secret ingredient to your successful level reworks.
    - **Invisible Details**: A small detail you've added that enhances believability, like the garlic plate in Wario's office.
    - **A Proud Moment**: The visual element or "placemaking" detail you're most proud of.
    - **The HUD**: Your work on the new health meter and other UI elements.
