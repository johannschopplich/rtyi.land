# Biobak (Graphics Artist & Designer)

::: tip Introduction

You're the visual wizard behind RTYI – when people see those stunning, modern-looking environments running on N64 hardware, that's your work. Tell me about your role and what drives you to create such detailed worlds for 30-year-old hardware.

**On Visuals & World-Building**

1.  We often see Kaze build a functional "blockout" version of a level to get the platforming right. Then later, we see your rework that completely transforms it. Can you walk me through your process? How do you take that basic layout and breathe life into it? Course 1, the Ghost Ship or Oily Boily Bay reworks are my favorite examples.

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Kaze's Reactions**: "Holy shit, everything is different" (Ghost Ship) and "Holy shit. This actually looks insane" (Oily Boily Bay) – how does it feel to surprise him?
    - **Starting Point**: What does a level look like when you receive it? MS Paint maps, basic geometry blocks?
    - **Detailed Communication**: Your comprehensive changelogs explaining every decision - how important is that documentation?
    - **Thematic Cohesion**: The Bomb Cap redesign as a "bomb manufacturing process" – how do you find the narrative thread?
    - **Lighting Solutions**: "The year's lighting now matching with the light from the windows was pissing me off, so I thought, what if the ceiling was the light source?" Your problem-solving process
    - **Practical Constraints**: "Fuck cranes. I hate modeling them" – how modeling limitations influence design decisions
    - **Quality Evolution**: How your standards and capabilities have evolved over the project's timeline
    - **Technical Challenges**: Sending high-poly models to Kaze for N64 optimization

2.  You create these detailed, modern-looking levels, but they have to run on 30-year-old hardware. What's your process for modeling and texturing something beautiful while constantly battling N64 polycounts, texture limits, and memory constraints?

    - The process of sending high-poly models to Kaze for optimization
    - Creative solutions for N64's limited color palette
    - Optimizing geometry and textures without losing the artistic vision
    - The story of the "Cursed Texture" and the 96x42 resolution workaround
    - An example of an idea that was just too ambitious for the hardware
    - An example of an idea that surprisingly _did_ work after some optimization

**On Collaboration & Creative Vision**

1.  How does Kaze communicate what he's looking for in a level's art style? Does he give you reference images or describe a "vibe?" How do you translate that direction into a cohesive visual identity?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Receiving MS Paint maps or blockout models
    - Translating a feeling or "vibe" into a concrete visual identity
    - Your role as an idea contributor beyond just visuals
    - Suggesting level flow or gameplay improvements
    - The story of suggesting the destructible planet for the Course 15 boss fight
    - A time Kaze's initial idea was vague and you had to define the look
    - A time your artistic choice fundamentally changed Kaze's initial gameplay idea

2.  Kaze often talks about creating "placeness", a sense that a level is a real, coherent environment. From your perspective as the artist, what does "placeness" mean? How do your level reworks, like for Oily Boily Bay or the Zoo, contribute to this goal beyond just making them "prettier"?

    - Using environmental details to tell a story
    - The importance of lighting in creating atmosphere on the N64
    - Small details that players might not notice but that add to the world's believability
    - How a level's visual identity influences asset creation (enemies, objects, etc.)
    - A favorite "placemaking" detail you've added that you're particularly proud of
