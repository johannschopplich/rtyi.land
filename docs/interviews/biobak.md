# Biobak (Graphics Artist & Designer)

::: tip Introduction

You're the visual artist behind many RTYI levels – when people see those modern-looking environments running on N64 hardware, that's your work. Tell me about your role and what drives you to create such detailed worlds for 30-year-old hardware.

**On Visuals & World-Building**

1.  We often see Kaze build a functional "blockout" version of a level to get the platforming right. Then later, we see your rework that completely transforms it. Can you walk me through your process? How do you take that basic layout and breathe life into it? Course 1, the Ghost Ship or Oily Boily Bay reworks are my favorite examples.

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Kaze's Reactions**: "Holy shit, everything is different" (Ghost Ship) and "Holy shit. This actually looks insane" (Oily Boily Bay) – how does it feel to surprise him?
    - **Starting Point**: What does a level look like when you receive it? MS Paint maps, basic geometry blocks?
    - **Detailed Communication**: Your comprehensive changelogs explaining every decision - how important is that documentation?
    - **Thematic Cohesion**: The Bomb Cap redesign as a "bomb manufacturing process" – how do you find the narrative thread?
    - **Lighting Solutions**: "The year's lighting now matching with the light from the windows was pissing me off, so I thought, what if the ceiling was the light source?" Your problem-solving process
    - **Practical Constraints**: "Fuck cranes. I hate modeling them" – how modeling limitations influence design decisions
    - **Quality Evolution**: How your standards and capabilities have evolved over the project's timeline
    - **Technical Challenges**: Sending high-poly models to Kaze for N64 optimization

2.  You create these detailed, modern-looking levels, but they have to run on 30-year-old hardware. What's your process for modeling and texturing something beautiful while constantly battling N64 polycounts, texture limits, and memory constraints?

    - **High-Poly to N64**: What's your process for creating detailed models knowing they'll be optimized for N64 hardware?
    - **Color Palette**: How do you create visual richness within N64's limited color palette?
    - **Optimization**: How do you optimize geometry and textures without losing your artistic vision?
    - **The Cursed Texture**: Tell me about the "Cursed Texture" and the 96x42 resolution workaround
    - **Hardware Defeat**: What's an example of an idea that was just too ambitious for the hardware?
    - **Surprising Success**: What's an idea that surprisingly _did_ work after some optimization?

**On Collaboration & Creative Vision**

1.  How does Kaze communicate what he's looking for in a level's art style? Does he give you reference images or describe a "vibe?" How do you translate that direction into a cohesive visual identity?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **From Blueprint to Beauty**: How do you transform Kaze's MS Paint maps or blockout models into stunning environments?
    - **Vibe Translation**: What's your process for translating a feeling or "vibe" into a concrete visual identity?
    - **Beyond Visuals**: How do you contribute ideas beyond just artistic direction?
    - **Level Flow Input**: What's your role in suggesting level flow or gameplay improvements?
    - **Boss Battle Innovation**: The story of suggesting the destructible planet for the Course 15 boss fight
    - **Creative Leadership**: Tell me about a time when Kaze's initial idea was vague and you had to define the look
    - **Artistic Influence**: When has your artistic choice fundamentally changed Kaze's initial gameplay idea?

    :::

2.  Kaze often talks about creating "placeness", a sense that a level is a real, coherent environment. From your perspective as the artist, what does "placeness" mean? How do your level reworks, like for Oily Boily Bay or the Zoo, contribute to this goal beyond just making them "prettier"?

    - **Environmental Storytelling**: How do you use environmental details to tell stories without words?
    - **N64 Atmosphere**: How do you create compelling lighting and atmosphere on the N64?
    - **Invisible Details**: What small details do you add that players might not notice but that enhance the world's believability?
    - **Visual Cohesion**: How does a level's visual identity influence your asset creation (enemies, objects, etc.)?
    - **Proudest Detail**: What's your favorite "placemaking" detail you've added that you're particularly proud of?
