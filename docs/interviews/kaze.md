# Kaze Emanuar (Lead Developer)

::: tip Introduction

Tell me about your role in creating RTYI – you're not just modding Mario 64, you're essentially rebuilding it from the ground up. How did you become the person crazy enough to take on that challenge?

## On Vision & Design Philosophy

1.  You have very clear design principles: creating "placeness," prioritizing excitement over difficulty, and respecting the player's time. Can you tell me about a time you had to make a tough call to stick to these principles? Maybe something you really liked but had to cut because it didn't fit?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **The Zoo Catalyst**: The Zoo's lag spiraling into a full engine rewrite: "The zoo is actually the reason I even started optimizing Mario 64. The zoo ran so poorly that I just could not take that."
    - **Placeness vs. Gameplay**: Balancing world-building with "excitement over difficulty."
    - **Killing Darlings**: Scrapping the "terrible" Space Arcade for the Shy Guy Space Station.
    - **Design Maturity**: Evolving from 5% design time (_Last Impact_) to 20% (RTYI).
    - **AAA Game Critique**: Designing to avoid modern AAA "chore" gameplay.
    - **Show, Don't Tell**: The philosophy behind removing exclamation marks and using "tutorial bunnies."

2.  You've said the Overworld is "the most important part of the game." What's your vision for it? How are you making it more than just a hub world by embracing the "if you can see it, you can go there" philosophy?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Secret Identity**: The overworld shaped like a Yoshi head.
    - **A Living World**: Permanent world changes after events (volcano eruption, rain stopping).
    - **Interconnected Design**: The river flowing from Course 2 through the whole overworld.
    - **The Lighthouse Puzzle**: Using the lighthouse to reveal the Ghost Ship.
    - **Dynamic Music**: Badub's 20 transitioning tracks for the overworld.
    - **Coin Economy**: Making coins "more valuable than Mario Odyssey" with shops.

## On Technical Mastery

1.  You didn't just mod SM64, you've rewritten huge chunks of its foundation: the sound engine, collision system, even the operating system. What drove you to take on these massive technical challenges? What can you do in RTYI that would be impossible without them?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Engine from Scratch**: The point of no return in rewriting the engine.
    - **The Sound Engine**: What was so "fucked" about the vanilla audio engine?
    - **Collision Overhaul**: Fixing the "unusable" vanilla collision and floor clocking.
    - **Microcode Collaboration**: Working with Sauraen on F3DEX3 to beat RSP bottlenecks.
    - **Performance Pride**: Achieving 60 FPS and the "Mario's behavior loop" i-cache optimization. Kaze: "This is an N64 game. How crazy is that?"
    - **Real-World Physics**: The paper airplane experiment and translating it to code.

2.  You often have to debug on real N64 hardware because emulators are often inaccurate. What's the most frustrating "emulator hell" bug you've dealt with? How do you even track down something that only breaks on a real console?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Emulator Hell**: Most frustrating hardware-only bug.
    - **The Compiler's Fault**: Debugging a crash caused by the compiler, not your code.
    - **Hardware vs. Emulator**: Why emulators can't be trusted for final performance.
    - **Essential Tools**: The importance of Sauraen's profiler and NEMU64.
    - **The EverDrive Failure**: The story behind the EverDrive X7 boot failure.
    - **The Phantom Bowser**: The bug that only happened on Project64.

## On Collaboration & The Public Eye

1.  You have a strong vision for RTYI, but you're also working with a talented team. How do you balance staying true to your vision while being open to their input? Can you recall a moment when a collaborator's suggestion fundamentally changed or improved your original idea?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Biobak's Reworks**: The "Holy shit, everything is different" moment.
    - **Badub's Music**: The "Cowboy Crisis" and music inspiring level design.
    - **Zeina's Concepts**: The "mutant Yoshi" boss and other artistic influences.
    - **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Solving the "unteachable tutorial" as a team.
    - **Managing Standards**: Hesitation to ask for help due to quality concerns.
    - **Creative Arguments**: Resolving disagreements with collaborators like Biobak.
    - **Quality Concerns**: Managing collaborative standards: "I do not want to reach out to people and ask for help. Because... I feel like I'm gonna say 'oh this actually isn't up to the quality standards I expect'."

    :::

2.  You develop RTYI live on stream with hundreds of people watching and commenting. How do you filter all that input? You've said you value the "feeling" behind feedback but not always the "reasoning." What does that mean in practice?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Feelings vs. Reasoning**: Your philosophy on processing viewer feedback.
    - **Community-Sourced Features**: The Whomp Tower, mirror wall, and growing vine ideas.
    - **Live Feedback Loop**: Biobak offering real-time color feedback during streams.
    - **The Pressure of Public Dev**: Balancing the YouTube algorithm vs. tedious development work.
    - **Community Testing**: Using questionnaires from the Course 1 demo.

## On The "Nintendo Risk" & The Future

1.  Nintendo has taken down over 70 of your videos. Every fan project lives under that shadow. How does this reality affect your development and release strategy? And what's your plan if the worst happens?

    - **"Calculated Risk" Mindset**: Why you continue despite the constant threat.
    - **"Win-Win" Scenario**: About a takedown being a PR opportunity.
    - **Contingency Plans**: The "legally distinct" asset-swap and open-sourcing the engine.
    - **The Profane Reply**: The story behind your colorful reply to a 2019 DMCA notice.
    - **Commercial Aspirations**: The long-term goal of a Kickstarter for an original game.
