# Zeina (Animator & Artist)

::: tip Introduction

You bring RTYI's characters to life through animation and art, but you're also Kaze's creative partner in life. Tell me about wearing both hats – being both an artist on the team and the person who sees this project's impact on your family every day.

**On Animation & Character**

1.  You bring the game's characters to life through animation. What's your approach to giving personality and emotion to characters within the N64's technical limits? The Piano Guy is a favorite character with so much charisma.

    - **The Wiggler Challenge**: "The most difficult one to animate yet" – what made this character so technically demanding?
    - **System Evolution**: Benefits of Kaze's new quaternion-based animation system vs. the old "geo bone" limitations
    - **Personality Through Movement**: Conveying character with limited polygons – the Piano Guy's charisma, Dry Bones personality
    - **Real-Time Creation**: Creating eye textures "in under 10 minutes" during live streams
    - **Critical Self-Evaluation**: Your professional assessment of your own Bowser animation shows high standards
    - **Animation Pipeline**: The workflow with Kaze – "All we're waiting for now is animations"
    - **Technical Constraints**: Working within N64's animation limitations while maintaining character appeal
    - **Rapid Iteration**: Creating sobbing animations for Koopa characters live during streams

**On Art, Design & Influence**

1.  Beyond animation, you contribute so much: 2D art, 3D models, concept art. Could you tell me about the story behind your concept for the mutant Yoshi boss, or your drawings for the zoo entrance? How did those initial ideas shape what the team built?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Concept to Reality**: How did your "mutant Yoshi" boss concept and zoo entrance drawings become key game elements?
    - **Character Modeling**: What's the challenge of creating characters like Peach and Toad within N64 constraints?
    - **Environmental Charm**: How do your texture contributions (bunny footprints, signs) add personality to the world?
    - **Style Coordination**: How do you coordinate with Biobak to maintain visual consistency?
    - **Planning Through Art**: "Zeina already has a lot of sketches about how Mario goes through the levels" – how does your art inform level design?
    - **Entrance Concepts**: Tell me about your concept art for Bunny Brushwoods, Koopa Wave Cove, and other areas
    - **Visual Influence**: How do your ideas shape the project's overall visual identity?
    - **Multi-Role Mastery**: "Helping out with anything else that he needs" – what's the scope of your contributions?

2.  Kaze often says your feedback as the "first playtester" is invaluable. I'd love to hear your side of the story where a section was so "painful to watch" you play that he made it easier. What kind of issues do you tend to notice that a programmer might miss?
