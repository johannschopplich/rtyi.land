# Zeina (Animator & Artist)

::: tip Introduction

You bring RTYI's characters to life through animation and art, but you're also Kaze's creative partner in life. Tell me about wearing both hats – being both an artist on the team and the person who sees this project's impact on your family every day.

## On Animation & Character

1.  You bring the game's characters to life through animation. What's your approach to giving personality and emotion to characters within the N64's technical limits? The Piano Guy is my favorite character. He has so much charisma.

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **The Wiggler Challenge**: "The most difficult one to animate yet."
    - **Personality in Polygons**: Giving characters like the Piano Guy or the "pouty" Bowser charisma with N64 limits.
    - **Animation Pipeline**: The workflow when Kaze is "waiting for animations" for a boss fight or NPC.
    - **Evolving Tools**: Kaze's new quaternion animation system vs. the old "geo bone" limits that required re-animating the penguins and Dory.
    - **Live Creation**: Creating eye textures "in under 10 minutes" on stream.
    - **Self-Critique**: Your high standards for your own work, like the Bowser animation.
    - **New Animation Format**: The new per-frame streaming system that allows for infinitely long animations, like the Mario shuffle dance.

## On Art, Design & Influence

1.  Beyond animation, you contribute so much: 2D art, 3D models, concept art. Could you tell me about the story behind your concept for the mutant Yoshi boss, or your drawings for the zoo entrance? How did those initial ideas shape what the team built?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Mutant Yoshi Boss**: The story behind your "mutant Yoshi" and "tentacle Yoshi" concept art.
    - **From 2D to 3D**: Your process for translating drawings (like the zoo entrance or level flow sketches) into game assets, including Wild West props that Kaze praised.
    - **Environmental Charm**: How small textures like bunny footprints or the "butt-print" texture add to the world.
    - **Artistic Coordination**: Coordinating with Biobak to maintain a consistent visual style.
    - **Planning Through Art**: How your sketches of level flow inform the final design. Kaze: "Zeina already has a lot of sketches about how Mario goes through the levels."
    - **The Scope of Your Role**: The wide range of your contributions, from animation to playtesting to modeling the Dry Bones.

2.  Kaze often says your feedback as the "first playtester" is invaluable. I'd love to hear your side of the story where a section was so "painful to watch" you play that he made it easier. What kind of issues do you tend to notice that a programmer might miss?

    - **The Quality Filter**: Your role as the bridge between developer and player.
    - **A Concrete Example**: A specific level or mechanic that changed because of your feedback.
