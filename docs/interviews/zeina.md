# Zeina (Animator & Artist)

::: tip Introduction

You bring RTYI's characters to life through animation and art, but you're also Kaze's creative partner in life. Tell me about wearing both hats – being both an artist on the team and the person who sees this project's impact on your family every day.

**On Animation & Character**

1.  You bring the game's characters to life through animation. What's your approach to giving personality and emotion to characters within the N64's technical limits? The Piano Guy is a favorite character with so much charisma.

**On Art, Design & Influence**

1.  Beyond animation, you contribute so much: 2D art, 3D models, concept art. Could you tell me about the story behind your concept for the mutant Yoshi boss, or your drawings for the zoo entrance? How did those initial ideas shape what the team built?

2.  Kaze often says your feedback as the "first playtester" is invaluable. I'd love to hear your side of the story where a section was so "painful to watch" you play that he made it easier. What kind of issues do you tend to notice that a programmer might miss?
