# Kaze & Zeina Joint Interview

These questions are for Kaze and Zeina together, focusing on their unique dynamic as both creative and personal partners.

1.  **A Shared Creation:** You're building RTYI together as collaborators and partners. How does that creative partnership work day-to-day? Where do you draw the line between work and home when you're both so deep in this project?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Design decisions made casually over dinner or at home
    - Switching off from "developer mode"
    - The dynamic of working in the same physical space, and how that changed when you moved and got separate rooms
    - How the project weaves into daily life
    - Balancing the creative work with personal life

2.  **The Feedback Loop:** You have this unique direct feedback loop. Kaze, you see your first player's raw reactions, and Zeina, you can give feedback directly to the lead developer. How does being partners affect that professional feedback? Does it make things easier or harder to be honest with each other?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - The "painful to watch" playtest from both perspectives
    - Resolving creative disagreements
    - Being each other's harshest critics
    - The benefits of being able to give instant, honest feedback
    - How personal dynamics affect professional choices on the game

3.  **The Animation Pipeline:** Let's walk through bringing a character to life together. Kaze, you program the behavior; Zeina, you provide the animation. Can you take me through the process for a specific character, like the Wiggler or Dry Bones? From "we need an enemy that does X" to the final, animated character in the game.

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - The back-and-forth on the Wiggler's notoriously difficult rigging
    - Kaze, what's it like seeing a finished animation for the first time?
    - How do technical constraints from Kaze meet Zeina's artistic vision?
    - The waiting game: "All we're waiting for now is animations"
    - How do animation changes affect programming, and vice versa?

4.  **Life, Art, and Parenthood:** This project has been part of your lives for years, and you became parents as it nears completion. How has this project shaped your life together, and how has your life, and parenthood, shaped the project and your perspective on it?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Life Integration**: Balancing development with life events (moving homes, making terrariums together, the infamous haircut streams)
    - **Financial Partnership**: Kaze's transparency about opportunity costs ("tens of thousands") and saving for a house together
    - **Work-Life Boundaries**: Zeina "banishing" Kaze to the basement vs. working in the same space
    - **Anniversary Moments**: Forgetting your third wedding anniversary until Kaze's father called during a stream
    - **Parenthood Perspective**: How becoming parents during the final phase changed the project's meaning
    - **Legacy Creation**: What does RTYI represent as something you've built together?
    - **Personal Moments**: The playful banter about cooking skills, hot dog definitions, and daily life bleeding into streams
    - **Support System**: Zeina meal prepping for Kaze's streaming schedule, managing life logistics around development
    - **For Global Audience**: Help viewers understand what it means to build something this ambitious as a family, and why someone would choose to work on "old games" instead of creating something new
