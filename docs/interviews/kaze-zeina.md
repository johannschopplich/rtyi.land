1.  **A Shared Creation:** You're building RTYI together as collaborators and partners. How does that creative partnership work day-to-day? Where do you draw the line between work and home when you're both so deep in this project?

    - **Creative Intimacy**: The unique advantage of having a partner who deeply understands your creative and technical struggles.

2.  **The Feedback Loop:** You have this unique direct feedback loop. Kaze, you see your first player's raw reactions, and Zeina, you can give feedback directly to the lead developer. How does being partners affect that professional feedback? Does it make things easier or harder to be honest with each other?

3.  **The Animation Pipeline:** Let's walk through bringing a character to life together. Kaze, you program the behavior; Zeina, you provide the animation. Can you take me through the process for a specific character, like the Wiggler or Dry Bones? From "we need an enemy that does X" to the final, animated character in the game.

    - **First Look**: Kaze's reaction to seeing a finished animation for the first time.
    - **Vision vs. Reality**: The negotiation between artistic vision and technical constraints.
