3.  **The Animation Pipeline:** Let's walk through bringing a character to life together. Kaze, you program the behavior; Zeina, you provide the animation. Can you take me through the process for a specific character, like the Wiggler or Dry Bones? From "we need an enemy that does X" to the final, animated character in the game.
