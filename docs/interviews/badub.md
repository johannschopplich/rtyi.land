# Badub (Composer)

::: tip Introduction

Music is the soul of any game, and your rich compositions for RTYI have this ability to transport players into each world. Tell me about your role as the composer and how you create that perfect musical identity for the project.

## On Musical Identity

1.  What's the musical identity you're creating for "Return to Yoshi's Island"? How do you blend the nostalgic sounds of Mario 64 and Yoshi's Island while creating something that feels both fresh and familiar?

    - **The Soundfont**: Creative use of the limited N64 soundfont.
    - **Familiar Yet Fresh**: Achieving a "new yet familiar" sound.
    - **Yoshi vs. Mario**: The influence of the "Yoshi's Island" vs. "Mario 64" themes.
    - **Thematic Diversity**: Creating a cohesive soundtrack across diverse level themes.

2.  Kaze has said your music directly inspires his level design. There's a moment when you sent the Cowboy Level track mid-stream and it completely transformed Kaze's creative block. He immediately started adding atmospheric elements and said "this is so perfect." Tell me about that moment and how it feels to have your music directly shape the level's atmosphere.

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **The Cowboy Music Moment**: Kaze's creative block on the Western level until your music arrived: "Oh, this is so good... that's so perfect."
    - **Vibe Translation**: Translating Kaze's brief ("evil, bowser, construction, goofy") into music.
    - **Music-Driven Design**: Your music often being the foundational step for a level's vibe.
    - **Creative Struggle**: The ten drafts for the Oily Boily Bay track.

## On The Craft of N64 Music

1.  Composing for the N64 has unique challenges – the small sound font, the limited ROM space. How do these limitations shape your compositions? Do you see them more as a restriction or a creative opportunity?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **ROM Space**: Composing within the strict 64MB ROM limit.
    - **Kaze's Custom Engine**: How the new, "80% faster" audio engine changed your process.
    - **Creative Workarounds**: Any clever workarounds for instrument or channel limitations.
    - **Streamed vs. Sequenced**: Deciding between streamed audio and sequenced M64 tracks.

2.  The overworld has nearly 20 tracks that seamlessly transition as the player explores. From a composer's perspective, what were the biggest challenges in creating such an ambitious and adaptive score for N64 hardware?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Seamless Transitions**: The challenge of making the overworld tracks transition seamlessly.
    - **Technical Collaboration**: The back-and-forth with Kaze to implement dynamic music triggers.
    - **Musical Storytelling**: Using music to reflect the "capitalist Bowser" theme or other story beats.
    - **Maintaining Identity**: Keeping a cohesive musical identity across the entire island.
