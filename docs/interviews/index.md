# Interview Questions for the RTYI Team

The questions are open-ended to establish core themes and encourage storytelling. I will actively listen for interesting stories to follow up on and dive into specific, role-oriented topics.

::: tip Global Audience Focus
This documentary targets an audience who may never have heard of ROM hacking, N64 development, or the Mario 64 modding scene. I want to encourage interviewees to naturally explain technical concepts, define jargon, and provide context that makes their work accessible to everyone.

## For All Team Members

These central questions are for Kaze, Biobak, Badub, and Zeina individually. This will hopefully allow me to weave together their different perspectives on the same key topics, creating a multi-faceted narrative for the documentary.

1.  **The Project:** Tell me about "Return to Yoshi's Island" – what is this project you've spent years of your life creating? What does it mean to take a beloved classic like Super Mario 64 and transform it into something entirely new?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Help viewers understand: What is ROM hacking? What makes this different from typical game mods?
    - The SM64 decompilation project – how did this change what was possible?
    - Why Yoshi's Island specifically? What about that game captured your imagination?
    - For people who've never heard of this scene – what drives someone to rebuild a 30-year-old game from the ground up?

    :::

2.  **The Genesis:** I'd love to hear how you first got involved with this project. What aspects of this specific idea resonated with you? What made you decide to commit to such a huge undertaking?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Initial excitement or skepticism when you first heard about the project
    - What was Kaze's pitch like to get you involved?
    - Personal nostalgia for Super Mario 64 or Yoshi's Island
    - **Kaze – The Real Origin Story**: "The zoo is actually the reason I even started optimizing Mario 64. The zoo ran so poorly that I just could not take that." Can you take me back to that specific moment when you decided enough was enough? For people unfamiliar with game development, help us understand what "lag" means and why fixing it required such extreme measures.
    - **Kaze – The Yoshi Connection**: "I like Yoshi. That's kind of where the thought process ended." What does that mean to you on a deeper level? What is it about Yoshi specifically that made this project worth years of your life?
    - **Kaze – Scope Realization**: Did you understand from the start that fixing one laggy level would lead to rewriting collision systems, sound engines, and graphics pipelines? How did fixing one problem reveal that the entire engine needed rebuilding?
    - **Team Members**: How did you realize this wasn't going to be a typical ROM hack but something much more ambitious?

    :::

3.  **The Drive:** This is years of work, all released for free. Kaze has described it as requiring an obsessive level of dedication, costing him "tens of thousands" personally. What keeps you going? What's the personal drive that makes you pour so much time and talent into this?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **The Creative Cycle**: "It always starts like really fun and eventually it turns into pure torture. That's just the cycle of making games." How do you navigate this emotional rollercoaster?
    - How do you push through burnout or creative blocks?
    - The desire to push the N64 to its limits and prove what's possible on 30-year-old hardware
    - **Financial Reality**: The "tens of thousands" in opportunity cost and reliance on community donations. How do you balance passion with practical concerns?
    - **Mental State**: "If you want to finish a Mario 64 major hack you need to be mentally ill" vs. "I'm not motivated at all... I just do it. It's really that easy." How do you reconcile the obsession required with the disciplined, workmanlike approach?
    - **Quality Standards**: "If they weren't even good enough for Mario 64, why would they be good enough for my game?" How does using Nintendo's classic as your quality benchmark drive you forward?

    :::

4.  **The Soul of RTYI:** From your role on the team, what do you think is the heart and soul of this game? What feeling or experience are you trying to create that makes it different from any other Mario 64 hack or even official Nintendo games?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - The game's specific "vibe" and "placeness"
    - How the Yoshi theme influences everything
    - Blending nostalgia with innovation
    - "Excitement over difficulty" philosophy
    - Creating intrinsic motivation vs. extrinsic rewards like coin collecting
    - Kaze's critique of AAA games that can feel like a "chore"

    :::

5.  **The Creative Process:** Could you walk me through the typical creative process? How does an idea become a finished piece, whether that's a level, a song, a model, or an animation? What is the collaboration like day-to-day?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **The "Shit Phase" Philosophy**: "It always looks like shit at the beginning." How do you push through the ugly early stages to reach the polished result?
    - **Design Evolution**: From 5% design time (Last Impact) to 20% (RTYI): "Back when I was making Last Impact, whenever I had an idea, I would just put it in almost unfiltered." How has your creative process matured?
    - **Real-Time Collaboration**: Team members contributing live during streams (Zeina creating textures "in under 10 minutes," Biobak offering color palette suggestions)
    - **Discord vs. Streams**: Creative "arguments in Discord DMs" then reaching agreements vs. live public feedback
    - **MS Paint to 3D**: The journey from rough sketches to final implementations
    - **Iteration Examples**: Course 11 being "improvised" and "making stuff up on the fly" - how do you balance planning vs. spontaneous creativity?
    - **Mathematical Precision**: The paper airplane development where you folded a real paper airplane to understand the physics, then applied trigonometry to create realistic flight mechanics. How do you balance mathematical accuracy with playable game feel?
    - **Community Collaboration**: Your development streams show viewers directly shaping major gameplay features. Can you walk me through how a viewer's suggestion like the Whomp Tower ("You could be waiting to be used as a building material, oh, okay. Yeah. That's a funny idea.") becomes a core puzzle element?
    - **Live Creative Process**: How does developing live on stream change the creative process compared to traditional game development? What's the difference between useful creative input and unhelpful technical advice from viewers?

    :::

6.  **A Story of a Challenge:** I'd love to hear about a time when things got really tough. Maybe a technical nightmare, a creative block, or even a disagreement. What happened, and how did you push through to that breakthrough moment?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **Hardware-Only Bugs**: The compiler generating faulty division-by-zero code that only manifested on real N64 hardware. "That is not a bug in the code. That is not my fault." How do you debug something that complex?
    - **Creative Dead Ends**: "The idea we had for this level is terrible." The Space Arcade concept being completely scrapped for the Shy Guy Space Station. How do you know when to kill your darlings?
    - **The Cowboy Crisis**: "This building style is just not exciting me" – the level struggling to find its identity until Badub's music arrived and transformed everything
    - **Biobak's Bomb Cap Crash**: A major level rework introducing a persistent crash that required systematic debugging to isolate actor overflow issues
    - **The Iridescent Oil Nightmare**: "Wow this looks terrible, oh my god this looks so bad. I absolutely hate this" – working through multiple streams to create the rainbow effect
    - **The Wet Cement Debug**: An entire stream debugging a texture effect only to discover a simple copy-paste error: "That part was missing everywhere. No wonder this didn't work."
    - **The Paper Airplane Physics Experiment**: Folding a real paper airplane to understand the mathematics ("I'm making a paper airplane to look at it. I got a piece of graph paper"), then spending an entire stream tweaking variables as physics went "volatile and chaotic." How do you balance real-world physics with playable game mechanics?
    - **Wiggler Animation Hell**: "The most difficult one to animate yet" – technical and creative challenges converging
    - **Happy Accidents**: How do you create conditions where "happy accidents" can happen? What's the most valuable thing you've learned from a mistake vs. planned optimization?

    :::

7.  **The N64 Spirit:** You're developing for hardware from 1996. How do those famous N64 limitations (low-poly models, texture memory, RAM limits) actually force you to be more creative? Can you share an example where a limitation led to something unique?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **For Global Audience**: Help explain what these N64 limitations mean in practical terms – like how 64MB is tiny compared to modern games
    - Working within a 64MB ROM and 4KB texture memory budget
    - The "fucked" vanilla audio engine requiring a complete rewrite
    - The vanilla collision system being "unusable"
    - Inventing CPU-based normal mapping for fake lighting on the styrofoam
    - The Oily Boily Bay rework pushing the game 1KB over the RAM limit
    - The freedom and challenges of the SM64 decompilation project
    - **Context for Viewers**: What makes pushing 30-year-old hardware impressive? Why not just use modern engines?
