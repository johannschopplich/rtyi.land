# Interview Questions for the RTYI Team

The questions are open-ended to establish core themes and encourage storytelling. I will actively listen for interesting stories to follow up on and dive into specific, role-oriented topics.

::: tip Global Audience Focus
This documentary targets an audience who may never have heard of ROM hacking, N64 development, or the Mario 64 modding scene. I want to encourage interviewees to naturally explain technical concepts, define jargon, and provide context that makes their work accessible to everyone.

## For All Team Members

These central questions are for Kaze, Biobak, Badub, and Zeina individually. This will hopefully allow me to weave together their different perspectives on the same key topics, creating a multi-faceted narrative for the documentary.
