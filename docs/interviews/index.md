# Interview Questions for the RTYI Team

The questions are open-ended to establish core themes and encourage storytelling. I will actively listen for interesting stories to follow up on and dive into specific, role-oriented topics.

::: tip Global Audience Focus
This documentary targets an audience who may never have heard of ROM hacking, N64 development, or the Mario 64 modding scene. I want to encourage interviewees to naturally explain technical concepts, define jargon, and provide context that makes their work accessible to everyone.

## For All Team Members

These central questions are for Kaze, Biobak, Badub, and Zeina individually. This will hopefully allow me to weave together their different perspectives on the same key topics, creating a multi-faceted narrative for the documentary.

0. **Warm-Up:** Let's start with a chill introduction. Who are you, what do you do on the RTYI team, and how long have you been involved with this project?

   - **Nintendo 64**: First N64 experience? Earliest childhood connection?
   - **Mario 64**: First encounter with the game?

2. **The Genesis:** I'd love to hear how you first got involved with this project. What aspects of this specific idea resonated with you? What made you decide to commit to such a huge undertaking?

   ::: info Follow-ups

   - **The Pitch (For Biobak, Badub, Zeina)**: Kaze's pitch to get you on board.

3. **The Drive:** This is years of work, all released for free. Kaze has described it as requiring an obsessive level of dedication, costing him "tens of thousands" personally. What keeps you going? What's the personal drive that makes you pour so much time and talent into this?

   ::: info Follow-ups

   - **The Creative Cycle (For Kaze)**: Navigating the "fun to pure torture" cycle. Kaze: "It always starts like really fun and eventually it turns into pure torture. That's just the cycle of making games."

   - **Motivation vs. Discipline**: Kaze's philosophy of "work without motivation."
   - **Financial Reality**: Balancing passion with the project's real-world costs, especially with Biobak's contract.
   - **The N64 Obsession**: The appeal of pushing 30-year-old hardware.
   - **Defining Quality**: What "quality" means for RTYI, and why Kaze says he'd rather make a "good game" than just optimize.

   :::

4. **The Soul of RTYI:** From your role on the team, what do you think is the heart and soul of this game? What feeling or experience are you trying to create that makes it different from any other Mario 64 hack or even official Nintendo games?

   - **The Yoshi Vibe**: Influence of the Yoshi's Island theme on your work.
   - **Capitalist Bowser**: The story theme of Bowser as a "ruthless capitalist" exploiting the island's resources.

   - **Innovation vs. Nostalgia**: Balancing new ideas with the classic feel.
   - **Intrinsic Motivation**: Designing for fun, not just for rewards.
   - **AAA Game Critique (For Kaze)**: Specific design choices to avoid being a "chore."

5. **The Creative Process:** Could you walk me through the typical creative process? How does an idea become a finished piece, whether that's a level, a song, a model, or an animation? What is the collaboration like day-to-day?

   ::: info Follow-ups

   - **The "Shit Phase"**: Pushing through the ugly early stages of creation.
   - **From Idea to Reality**: A specific example of a level, song, or character's evolution.

   - **Team Communication**: How the team stays in sync and resolves creative disagreements.
   - **Design Maturity (For Kaze)**: The shift from 5% design time on _Last Impact_ to 20% on RTYI: "Back when I was making Last Impact, whenever I had an idea, I would just put it in almost unfiltered."

   :::

6. **A Story of a Challenge:** Was there a moment you thought "this might not happen"? Maybe a technical nightmare, a creative block, a financial scare, or even a disagreement, that made you genuinely doubt if Return to Yoshi's Island would ever be finished? What happened, and how did you push through to that breakthrough moment?

   ::: info Follow-ups

   - **Technical Nightmare**: Most frustrating bug: hardware-only crash, compiler error, etc.
   - **A Breakthrough Moment**: The most satisfying problem you've solved.
   - **Creative Dead End**: Scrapping the "Space Arcade" for the "Shy Guy Space Station," or the pivot from volcano to oil rig for Course 11.
   - **The Cowboy Crisis (For Kaze, Badub)**: The level struggling until Badub's music arrived.
   - **The Physics of Flight (For Kaze)**: Folding and translating a real paper airplane's flight into N64 code.
   - **The Wiggler Animation (For Zeina)**: The story behind the "most difficult to animate" character.
   - **The Oily Boily Bay Music (For Badub)**: The story of the ten drafts it took to get the music right.

   :::

7. **The N64 Spirit:** You're developing for hardware from 1996. How do those famous N64 limitations (low-poly models, texture memory, RAM limits) actually force you to be more creative? Can you share an example where a limitation led to something unique?

   ::: info Follow-ups

   - **Outdated Hardware**: Why not use modern engines?
   - **Creative Constraint**: An example of a hardware limitation forcing a creative solution.
   - **ROM Space**: The importance of staying within the 64MB cartridge size, especially when music takes up over half the space. What to chop if exceeding it?
   - **Engine Rewrite (For Kaze)**: The "this is broken" moment that forced a rewrite of a core system like collision or audio.
   - **Hardware Surprises**: The "hidden megabyte" and other unexpected discoveries.
