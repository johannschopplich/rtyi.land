The Making of LEGO Island： A Documentary [bG55COe_f8I]:
This may look like an unassuming game from the 90s, a relic from a time when 3D was still largely uncharted territory, but Beyond Its Primitive Exterior is a game that was not only technologically innovative, but had a story, characters and a universe that captured the imaginations of a generation. A game that resonated with players in a way that most games never do, making such an impression that we're still talking about it nearly 30 years later. This is LEGO Island. It was really an extensive project involving very talented people. I mean it was outrageous the amount of talent behind that. I think we were having so much fun, we didn't consider that we were doing something that no one else had ever done. We were at the bleeding edge and they were just learning from us. Today LEGO video games are an institution, a business worth over $2 billion, but the good chance none of it would exist had this, their first real venture into them, not worked out. And with one of the biggest toy companies in the world gambling on an entirely new medium, success was anything but guaranteed. But LEGO's bet happened to be on the right people at the right time, who made something great in the face of technical challenges, corporate conflicts and ultimately, betrayal. Like many risky ventures, LEGO Island had a lot riding on it. Its conception is the story of two formerly successful companies who, despite being in different fields and on opposite sides of the planet, were both going through hard times and looking for a way out. Of course, we can't talk about LEGO Island without first talking about its namesake, LEGO. And really, what's there to say? The chances of you stumbling upon this video and not knowing LEGO is virtually zero. There are probably space aliens in the Andromeda Galaxy who have heard about LEGO. Since 1947, year after year, these toys just seem to get more and more popular. Or do they? Our top story tonight, the Danish toy maker LEGO has announced a loss of 194 million kroner or 45 million pounds last year, its first annual loss since the company was founded in the 1930s. For the first time, LEGO's sales were also struggling a little bit. There was a real doubt inside the company, even high up, that whether the LEGO idea was kind of done. You have seen other toys come and go. So maybe, you know, the world was changing. Everything's the start of the company, basically. They'd always had an increase in turnover every year. Increase in turnover, increase in profits. So they just simply did not know crisis, but they came to know that in the late 90s. The company, best known for its interlocking plastic bricks, has reported stagnating growth since 1993. So after 50 years, what was giving LEGO such a headache? Well, indeed, the world was changing. And while LEGO had always had competitors in the toy industry, the 80s and 90s had birthed a brand new, much fiercer competitor, or I guess I should say, competitors. The Sega Genesis has blast processing, Super Nintendo doesn't. Yeah, you guessed it. While some missteps in the early 80s may have made them easy to write off as a passing fad, by the 90s, it was undeniable. Nintendo, Sega, and their vicious Civil War were dominating the hearts and minds of kids all around the world. The writing was on the wall, kids were putting down bricks and picking up a different kind of brick. Or, you know, whatever this was. By comparison, it wasn't hard for LEGO to look like old news. I went to this meeting where our international marketing research, the first slide they showed was they said, LEGO is the fifth largest toy company in the world. Number one is Nintendo, and number two was Mattel, and number three was Sega, and number four was Hasbro, and then LEGO. And then they said, Nintendo and Sega, we don't look at because they don't do construction toys. They were looking at competitors of companies that would do like Lincoln Logs or something, not at who was competing for the children's time. I was flabbergasted. I was like, don't they see what's happening? A lot of uncertainty and also some resistance, I would say, to really take digital into sort of the heart of LEGO. It was absolutely a challenge, and they also had no place in the digital world at that point. We had to teach them about the business and then try to convince them that they needed to be in it. Oh, dear. At some point, somebody at LEGO, and even at the top, realized that software was interesting. I was asked to look into the market for children's software. We made a recommendation to the LEGO group. In one way or another, we had to enter that market because it was going to infect everything around kids' play. I was sort of hired also to look more into what we could do with digital in general. We were mostly just presenting a lot of different ideas. There was a new thing called the PC. Maybe all people would have a computer at home, you know, for real and so on, but no one knew really what direction it would take. LEGO was finally willing to at least experiment with digital ideas, but they were still several years away from being able to make their own video games, and the world wasn't going to sit around and wait for them to be ready. Wouldn't it be great if they could get some help from people who already knew how to navigate this new world? I might be wrong, but it was always my recollection that the US guys were really pushing to get LEGO into the software business. They knew that it was a place that was going to be important, and they just wanted to find a good partner to help them figure it out. Founded in the suburbs of Chicago in 1983, Mindscape had carved out a respectable game publishing business, eventually even becoming one of the elite few to secure a license to publish for that pesky Nintendo. In 1988, it was acquired by and merged into The Software Toolworks, a California-based developer best known for educational games like Just Master 2000 and Mavis Beacon Teacher's Typing. Toolworks, who mostly wanted that lucrative Nintendo contract, could now lean even harder into the educational market with games like Miracle Piano and a series of officially licensed Mario games. Things were looking good. So good that in 1994, Pearson, yes, the company that makes your textbooks, acquired them and renamed the whole company back to Mindscape. Mindscape. Yes, I much approve of that. It is a quantum leap above Software Toolworks. While Pearson was heavily criticized for overpaying for Mindscape, they had high hopes that Venture into Software would pay off in the long run. In the first two years under Pearson, Mindscape lost nearly 80 million dollars. Welcome to Nevada, California. A quiet town, relatively speaking, about 20 miles north of San Francisco. This is where Software Toolworks, or Mindscape by this point, moved to just before the development of Lego Island. This exact building, in fact, which they built themselves from the ground up. Not bad for a company that, on paper at least, seemed to be hemorrhaging money. We just did an awful lot of different things. We had edutainment, entertainment, utility software, and always had an eye to something new and interesting. Just like the toy industry was changing around Lego, so was the video game industry around Mindscape. New talk of 3D and the Hollywood model meant that Mindscape was feeling a lot of pressure to keep up and pursue higher profile clients. The Software Toolworks presents... By the mid-90s, Mindscape's most successful games were based on licensed properties. They'd made games for Star Wars, games for Nintendo, games for Warhammer, all these things that were really popular with kids. Hey, you know what else is really popular with kids? We certainly were interested in a content partner that brought as much to the table as Lego did. We put a couple of very good guys on it, Paul Melmed, Mark Rogiers, and a guy named Wes Jenkins. Wes Jenkins was about as far from the corporate suits as you could get. Having grown up in the counterculture of the 60s and 70s, and even attending the original Woodstock in 1969, he and his wife Kyle eventually joined the hippies and artists of San Francisco, doing art jobs for just about anyone they could, and making friends with all the other struggling artists in the area. Wes Jenkins and Kyle Volkermans, they lived in apartment number nine, we lived in apartment number three. They were both really charming, really smart, really talented. And we would get together, and they had a radio show going called Radio Shorts. Monday, come on down, Tuesday, doesn't matter, Sunday, no credit, no job, no car, come on down. No semiannual minus charge for buying worthless junk you don't need like the pathetic sheep you are. It was utter madness and mayhem. Everybody would come in with scripts for these comedy bits. When the people were not singing or playing instruments on a given part, the others would be drinking and eating in the other room. It was nuts, but it was really fun. Quite a production, too. A lot of people coming and going. Jack Daniels involved. A song. Yeah, a song. Yeah, it was one of those things you look back on and realize you only get to do things like that a couple of times in your life. Throughout the 80s, Wes had managed to do one-off jobs for the likes of NASA, Disney, PBS, and even Frank Zappa, but by the 90s had landed a lowly job as an artist at the Software Toolworks. Artists at the time were the necessary evil for most programmers. Programmers designed everything, the concept, the game, and would even insert programmer art for us to follow. Really, you couldn't risk the artist to be in charge of anything important. Lord knows what they'd do. It was a cultural issue. But that culture was about to change. As graphics technology advanced and became an increasingly important selling point, game developers like Mindscape were going to start needing their artists more than ever. Mark Rogiers, head of the newly formed Home and Kids division, asked the guy in the cubicle next to mine, who had just transferred to the art team as a former programmer, to make a 3D Lego brick. He made a rectangle with six little bumps on top and it could be moved around like magic. We were blown away. But of course, Mindscape realised they needed more than just a 3D brick if they were going to pitch a real product to Lego. They needed a concept, and for that, they turned to none other than Wes Jenkins himself. Whether it was because I was the next cubicle over or the programmers were too busy and I was available, I like to think it was because the bosses thought I was the right guy for the assignment. Whatever the reason was for choosing Wes Jenkins, they were right. Because it turns out Mindscape was far from the first company to try pitching a video game to Lego. Sure, it took a while before Lego themselves were convinced, but many others had realised you could build Lego with a computer. But Lego knew that the whole point of their bricks was that you were using your hands to make something in the real world. What was the point if by the end, everything you made was stuck inside a computer? And that was the genius of Wes Jenkins, he was the first person to propose something else. Rather than recreating the real world experience of playing with Lego, Wes Jenkins' idea was to capture what happens in your imagination when you play with Lego. What would it be like to be a Lego person in a Lego world? And from their point of view, something that could only be done in 3D. You know, the only way to visit Lego Island is to become a Lego person! Mindscape higher ups liked the concept too and decided it was worth reaching out to Lego to see what they thought. Except, they didn't really have a way to do that. I mean, if this was high school, Mindscape was like the nerdy guy trying to get the attention of the popular girl. Clearly, they were going to have to do something radical. Some people have Christmas and Hanukkah to get excited for the new toys coming out for the holiday season. For me, it starts in February at Toy Fair. In order to find an elusive contact at Lego, Mindscape sent Wes Jenkins and their educational expert Paul Melmed here, the International Toy Fair in New York City. Tearing up the streets in 1995 and destroying the competition. They were tasked with simply finding someone, anyone, who could get them into the good grace of Lego. And amazingly enough, they actually did. Tucked into a corner on the second floor of the building was Lego's U.S. Marketing Director Chuck McLeish. He explains that Lego is not really in the business of making video games and a bunch of companies, hundreds, have already approached them and they have all proposed these building with Lego programs on the computer. Paul explains that we could actually increase the sales of the bricks with this product. This is different. Our idea is more of a story, an interactive adventure. Oh, well, that was interesting. Chuck seemed impressed and gives Paul the phone number of the guy at the headquarters in Connecticut. He suggested we call and set up an appointment. Maybe it was down to the idea. Maybe it was being in the right place at the right time. Maybe it was through the sheer charm of Wes Jenkins and Paul Melmed. But just like that, Mindscape had an in with Lego. Lego's U.S. bosses in Connecticut were similarly intrigued by their idea, but ultimately none of it mattered unless they could also impress the guys at the top. And for that, they would need to book a trip to Europe. I would say there was a clear amount of nervousness when we went to London in 95 to have that meeting because everybody that mattered at Lego was there. We were on Monkey Island. Which is a little island outside of London. This is where LEGO did their royalty deals. Our fate was in the hands of LEGO because we had to get their approval on so many, many levels. LEGO was always perfect and they never put it in a box until they knew that it was going to work. Computer software, when we were working on LEGO Island, every product crashed. If it crashed, 20% of the time, we felt, hey, let's put it in a box. It's pretty good. Well, try that with these guys, who want perfection. One of the things I learned is that the Danish have different personality traits than we do. They're very friendly, but they don't wear their emotions on their sleeves. And, you know, when we were sitting there delivering this several-hour-long presentation to them, there was very little facial feedback or very little smiles, very little anything that came out of them. We walked in with a small computer and let it run, and it was magnificent. It worked. We could take a mouse and have a LEGO car spin 360 on the screen. No one had ever seen that before, ever. Then the president of LEGO, he said to me, so, Dr. Melamed, you were telling me seven-year-olds love computers. I said, absolutely. He said, how can you guarantee me that your product won't cannibalize mine? Are they going to like it so much they won't buy my bricks anymore? Now, here I was, this education guy, you know, talking to one of the wealthiest guys on the planet, perhaps. And I said, no. Just the opposite is going to happen, because once they solve problems on the screen, they'll want to get their hands on the real product. And that also happened. Their sales went up. And what I recall is, at the end of the thing, we actually got an ovation from the LEGO team. And as we walked out of the room, I said to Chuck McLeish, who was the US guy from LEGO, I said, so, is that good? He said, well, I've worked here, you know, many years. And on my best presentation, they said to me, well, that wasn't so bad. We felt that we had it in the bag at that point. Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines, please, and go! And they were off. What had started as nothing more than a crude brick on a screen was now a fully-fledged production with one of the biggest toy companies in the world. And all headed by Wes Jenkins, who only months earlier was on the bottom of the Mindscape totem pole. No pressure, right? But for Wes, it was a dream come true, and he could hardly believe his luck. I couldn't quite figure out how I ended up in this Forrest Gump-like opportunity. I assumed that I'd be asked to go back to moving pixels around, and they'll take it from here. It was just the way the industry worked, and that's the way the game artist's job was in 1995. Shortly after landing the deal, Mark Rogiez and Dave Grunewetzky left Mindscape for other companies. While Wes Jenkins and Paul Melmert were clearly great at coming up with ideas and pitching them, they needed someone who could help run the project. Someone who could make sure everything went smoothly and provide a bridge between the business side and the creative side. Someone like this. Hi, I'm Scott Anderson, and I'm the producer of the LEGO project Adventures on LEGO Island. I heard that Mindscape was putting together a project with LEGO, and I'm an old LEGO fan, so I just thought, well, this is fantastic. I didn't think that they really understood how great it was. And when I got in touch with them, I was right. They didn't really understand how great it was. The way things worked at Mindscape was, you were hired and then the next day you had to meet with everybody and tell them what was going on. And it was like, how was I supposed to know what was going on? I got together with Wes Jenkins and kind of sketched out some ideas that we had about where things were going. And I said, let's do some scripting. Let's do some dialogue. And we went our own ways and came back the next day and we had done almost identical dialogue. And I knew then that we were brothers, that we were going to be able to work together and that we shared the same sort of ridiculous comic sensibilities. We became really close friends. In another moment of blind luck, Mindscape had once again managed to find just the right person for the job. Wes Jenkins and Scott Anderson were like long lost brothers, constantly bouncing jokes and ideas off each other. And together with educational expert Paul Melmed, they had just the right team to write the script for LEGO Ireland. It was so much fun. And we would go and we would have these meetings. We would take them off campus because it was oftentimes impossible to do any work at Mindscape itself. And we would have yes meetings. We would get together and we would talk about all the possible things that we could do. And nobody was allowed to say no because there was no constraint because nobody was saying no all the time. We would talk about all these great ideas. And then the next day we would come back, hopefully a little more sober and everybody would try and figure out which of those ideas were the best. Based upon thinking about it overnight, people came up with different ideas. People came up with reasons why we might want to scale back here and go forward here. So we were guided by a lot of really good ideas and threw away a lot of really bad ideas. And those are the two things that we had to do. So LEGO Ireland had a team of dedicated writers, but who were they going to get to read it? Contrary to what you might think, software companies in the 90s weren't exactly bursting at the seams with voice acting talent. If only one of them had been hosting a comedy radio show for years at that point and therefore knew a bunch of singers and voice actors. Hey, wait a minute! So he got involved with a lot of the people that he knew and that he'd been working with. Lorne Nelson, for instance, he did a ton of stuff. And then he also knew a lot of voiceover people. He had a knack for finding really talented people who were really funny. I was the one that went, why don't you face it, we're lost! Face it, you're lost. I know there's an exit around here somewhere. And then I was also Nancy Nubbin. The biggest thing to remember, it's like you're a cartoon guy. You're a cartoon gal. And I am. And you are. In my mind. And you are. So the neatest thing is to push it over the top. When you feel as though there is a need to ham it up, that's really good. Well, ain't she a beaut? Click on the car if you want to get in and drive safe now. Of course, Wes Jenkins' radio background manifested in more obvious ways too. That's right, we make a pizza, we make a pasta, we make lots of money, why? We're the only place to eat on the island. Just remember our motto, bricolinis. Where else you gonna eat? With a passionate team of writers, as well as a few of their friends, everything seemed to be falling into place. Except one thing. One huge elephant in the room that could make or break the entire project. The whole thing had been designed around this idea that for the first time, you could really get into the head of a LEGO person. But in truth, they still weren't entirely sure that was possible. There was 3D at the time, but there was 3D in the form of like Doom, where you were inside of a room. And then there was 3D where you're up in an airplane flying over terrain. Combining those two to get the long distance and close up distance was not something that was being done at the time. And we were told that it wasn't possible. We knew that nobody had really tried anything of this sort before because we had nothing whatsoever to refer to. Even though it was a big company then, and it was somewhat formalized, you know, we were still all learning how we were building games. They were still evolving so much. So it wasn't a matter of just getting a cookbook and figuring things out. It was really a matter of slogging through the creation of every single little bit of this. It was a tricky thing in terms of hiring programmers, in terms of hiring artists. I got a hold of Dennis Goodrow. Dennis and I are old friends. We were college roommates. Hi, I'm Dennis Goodrow. Thank you, Perijot. What we're looking at here is the Jet Ski Race that's part of the Adventures on LEGO Island. He's just brilliant, and he is one of the best programmers in the world. And we spent a lot of time looking for ways of using Direct3D to get the maximum performance and still deliver the best quality images. Performance. That's what it all came down to. Rendering a nice 3D image? People have been doing that for years by that point. But rendering them so quickly that you can actually facilitate gameplay on an average family computer at the time? Therein lies the real challenge. There's a portion that you're actually building the little race car. And the parts are, the LEGO parts are spinning. And if you don't get the math right, each part will grow and shrink as it's turning. That had a cool effect, don't get me wrong. But that was a crazy challenge. Just getting the math right and getting it performant enough with the CPUs that were not Pentiums. This was meant to run also on a 486. Slower than your Apple Watch. Significantly slower than your Apple Watch. There were days that were filled with trying to do things to improve performance. You know, the part where you go in the race, the whole reason for going in the caves and all that was having it be mostly black in there improved the performance enough so that we said, okay, we can have a little race game in here and it'll work. So that was one of the kinds of things we'd do. Making it an island was limiting how much you had to worry about. It wasn't an unlimited world. Mindscape had licensed this library that eventually Microsoft purchased called Retain Mode. Unless you knew exactly what Retain Mode was doing, you wouldn't get it performant enough. And that was a very big challenge. I would fly to Microsoft and talk to them. They also didn't know many of the answers that I was asking. And they were trying to figure out, as I provided hints of problems, so it didn't take me long to realize we were at the bleeding edge and they were just learning from us. And a lot of the people running the project said, well, we don't understand. If I open a door in Lego Island, what happens? And I said, well, what happens in your house when you open the door? There's the world outside. And they said, that's weird. It was difficult to explain to management and it was difficult for the entire team. The harder part was like, oh, I don't know how to do this. Oh, it doesn't fit in the constraints. I only have this much room. And then I would come back and ask Dennis, we got to make this car go up over a ridge, spin down, go down a lane and not fall into the ocean and spin around again. He says, are you kidding? And then Scott would insist on it. And Wes said how cool it could be. We wanted to do what the kids thought would be really fun. 360 degree rotation and I'm still pushing Mongo footage? Am I a rad ripper or what? The team grew, but internally it was, it was a very, very small team. For the most part, the artists were working on a few tables around just one or two corners. But we had, you know, buckets of toys to play with and acting like, you know, 10 years old with lunchtime. What if he did this? You know, if somebody came in the room, you get paid for this? In the middle of the room was this huge physical model of the island that had been designed by Wes Jenkins. I don't know, it was like an enlarged pool table with a flat top with a sort of a scale model of Lego Island, right? It was about 20 by 30 feet. It was large. We had to get a special room. We always tested the thing. That was the other thing that we did. I would bring groups of children in to look at the island and play. And that was the coolest thing. Little kids would come in and, you know, it's not the iPhone down there. They would literally come in with a real camera, disposable camera, and take pictures with it. I wish, I wish I could, any one of you that hear this, if you have a picture, you can send that to me. That would be fantastic. I would love to see that. The kids taught us all sorts of things. I mean, the kids were just fantastic. Lego was also trying to figure out the difference between boys and girls. And we found out there really wasn't that much difference. I mean, Lego decided we're mostly boys that are buying our product. Let's have some girls. So they started creating pink and purple bricks. And we said, that's not what we're seeing. We're not seeing that the girls like pink and purple. They were playing just like the boys were, which I think shocked Lego. That feedback was why we knew when it came out that it was going to be a hit. We knew that it was going to be a hit. Well, software guys at Mindscape felt pretty good about what they were doing. But what about the conservative toy veterans at Lego? You have to remember these guys' slogan is only the best is good enough. And their experience in video games at this point was basically non-existent. Did they even know what to make of this decidedly non-brick shaped product? We went to see them in Denmark and Wes was going to get up and give a talk. And he couldn't. He was just so anxious, he just couldn't talk. And so he said, Scott, would you do it? And I said, well, I don't really know what you were about to say. But I got up and I gave my talk and I wrote things on the whiteboard. And then somebody came by later and erased it and I found out that I was using the permanent markers. So we left a great impression on the people. At LEGO, we told them that we thought that the game was going to do this and that. They said, well, no, that doesn't make any sense, you guys. Everything has to be done with bricks. And we were like, well, can't you use ropes? Can't you use some of the standard things that people use? No, those aren't LEGO things. And so we got our first lesson in what it was like to actually do the right thing for LEGO. At the beginning, the LEGO group wanted every stud on every brick to have a little LEGO logo on it like their real LEGOs have. And it was quite an argument to say, no, we can't do that. Nowadays, maybe you could do that. But back then, there was no possibility. They insisted that LEGOs don't bend. So none of the characters had arms or legs that would bend. And that put quite a requirement on the animators. You had to move their arms like this and their head turned like this. And they don't have knees. Their legs go like this. That's it. OK. They didn't want any twisting or bending or anything. So you had to figure out how to express with those limitations. I can only play the piano like that. Or maybe my head pops off to express something. This notion of how do LEGO characters move? Can they bend their arms when they can't bend their arms in real life? Because a LEGO character can't drink from a cup. There was a LEGO parrot, but it couldn't fly because its wings were part of the body. But there was a religion about that. Surprised we actually even made a helicopter look like it was flying by itself. Now, when LEGO Island 2 came out, the first thing you see is Pepper twists and his whole body twists. I'm like, oh, well, they just threw that out the window. And it took a long time for LEGO to figure out how to actually do software. You have to imagine people looking at software and saying, but it's not got no studs on it. They would tell us, if you do software, we have to have the final screenshots 18 months before launch. And in software, we were not even starting to create screens 18 months. We were like, no, no, we can deliver it a week before. It's like, so there was a completely cultural clash there. When we told LEGO that it was going to take two years to create the product, they were stunned. They were taken aback. They were not happy. Ultimately, what we decided to do in order to placate them, in a sense, was we created these little miniature parts of the program and we completed them. We brought them all the way to completion. So we had the building of the jet ski and we completed that. And then we put that onto a disc and we sent it off to LEGO. We showed them how it worked. They were very happy because then they had something that showed that we were actually doing something. They were really, really hard to please. But what happened as a consequence is we made something that was better than we ever would have thought to make without them. For the LEGO Group, nothing short of world-class quality will do. And that wasn't the only perk of LEGO's high standards. Remember how Mindscape was like the nerdy kid in high school? Well, being with a popular girl definitely had its perks. When you're representing LEGO, you can knock on any door. Everybody talks to you. Everybody loves LEGO. That brand was so amazing in terms of getting us through doors and getting us to talk to people. The voice actors were amazing. I mean, having my first cinematic be to June Foray's voice, who I listened to as a kid doing Broomhilda and Rocky and Bullwinkle was like, ooh. Where's my piano? Oh, here it is. You know, this is the voice I grew up with. I was a little kid listening to like Rocky and Bullwinkle, you know? I mean, that was amazing. I would sit there in my cubicle and I would be talking to actors and rock and roll people. You know, we were talking to Aerosmith. We were talking to all these people. We were originally going to have some Beach Boys songs in LEGO Island. We had to deal with Brooke Shields. She was going to be called Brick Shields, of course. And they all wanted to work on the project because they knew LEGO. LEGO was such a great brand. We didn't get all of them because we couldn't afford all of them. But it was all right. The way that it turned out, we had some really good musicians anyway. You can build a buggy, drive a big tow truck. When I wrote the music, I was trying to think like a kid. And if I was like eight years old and really high on sugar, what would I want to hear? Wes gave us a title and a list of things they wanted to be mentioned. Oh, that's right. Yeah. A bunch of the phrases in the song came straight from him. That drove how the music felt, which in turn drove the rest of the words we needed. Add a little bit of Bondo and some glue to hold it together. I also supplied Mama Briccolini's piano playing. Hey Pepper, what do you think of this? That's nice, isn't it? I went over to a friend's house and spent a day racking my brain, getting to the point where I was pounding at the piano because they wanted lots of little tiny pieces and they all had to be different. For all the music that was used on Lego Island, there was easily twice as much that was pitched. So what if they didn't have that many celebrities working on the game? What they did have from the artists to the programmers were passionate workers committed to holding this game over the finish line, which as I'm sure you can imagine was easier said than done. For the most part of the game, you had three engineers do most of the coding, which was crazy. The coding probably took less than 13 months. It was a crazy pace. Towards the end, Dennis and I would work really late into the evening trying to fix some bugs and burn some CDs so that QA people could start testing in the morning. I'd get home at one o'clock in the morning and then leave at seven or eight the next morning to go back to work. And my wife's friends would say, oh, he's having an affair, there's something going on. But it was really, you know, it didn't feel like hard work at that point. It was just, there was a lot to get done. You had to get it out before Christmas. There was no internet, so you can't patch the game without working 80 hours a week. It's definitely not without its pain. I mean, every day I feel, oh God, I can't get this to work. Even 30 years later, you know, why am I? Oh, it's terrible. I walk away and I come back and I look at the work and I go, oh, oh wait, I know what to do. And then before you know it, you've just invested another four hours and you made that, oh yeah, you know, and you did a 12-hour day. We sat there and worked and I would drink my Mountain Dew and I'd put my cans on the window and slowly build up this stack of Mountain Dew cans over the course of how many months, I don't know. I filled up the wall. You're always rewarded with pizza on a late night. You're working a lot of hours. You're like, you go out with your sweetheart after no pizza because work gives us lots of pizza. We were very serious about it. We spent all of our time. This was, you know, we were all working very, very hard on this and it was a labor of love. There was never a moment where we thought that, oh, we just have to get this done because we have to get it done. It was like, not only do we need to get it done, but we need to get it done better. And we were just always pumping each other up to go farther and to do more than what anybody else was doing at the time. For some reason, I never get tired. Of course, I'm a nervous wrench. Our project was uniquely happy for a software development project. Our team was coming in on the weekends to do something in secret. I didn't know what it was and they didn't want me to know. They wanted to surprise me. Check this out. We can find this. They had taken all the art masters and redone them in Legos and they did it on their own. Nobody told them to do that. That was not a part of the plan. That's them sitting on my desk ever since. That's 25 years of sitting on my desk. That's the kind of enthusiasm. That's the kind of, we're going to do it because we love it. That's what went into this game. While it's never easy reaching the end of a large scale project, the Lego Island team actually had a better time than most. Their method of completing the game piece by piece to appease Lego also ended up making it a lot easier to plan and keep track of time throughout development. We had been creating these parts all the way along and finishing those parts that we had been showing off to Lego and taking to the toy fairs and things like that. So at the end, there was a crunch. There's always a crunch at the end, but it was pretty close to being right on time. Lego Island went gold on August 8th, 1997. That's when everyone had to put their pencils down and turn in whatever they'd done. The project has to end at some point, right? Otherwise you'd be constantly adding things to it forever. We didn't do as much as we wanted. You know, the place still looks kind of barren. We got to a pretty hard release date and there was still stuff undone. You know, there was always the, ooh, ooh, let's add that in. And then, oh, it takes that much work. Moving around the island in an uncontrollable way is something that I really wish we had taken care of. We know it was going to be a problem when machines were sped up when we released it, but they wouldn't give me the time to take care of it. And in fact, there are some people trying to actually update Lego Island somehow. I'm not sure how that's going to work because I don't know who has the source code. Sure, they may have wished they could have done more, but let's not diminish what they accomplished. 640x480 3D gameplay at a time when consoles were only pushing 240p. Simultaneous music, sound effects, and video all off a 2x CD-ROM and in only 16 megabytes of RAM. Most importantly, a game that, as intended, simulated not just the physical experience of playing with Lego, but the emotional experience too. What it would be like to be a Lego person in a Lego world. Wes Jenkins' vision, which had guided the project from the beginning, had finally come to fruition. At that point, what could possibly go wrong? When I first met him, he was complaining about management. And I thought, oh, what a whiny baby. The first person I'm going to fire here is Wes. And then like the next day, when we came back and we saw that we'd written the same scripts, I thought, wait, wait, this isn't right. Clearly this guy is fantastic. And then that's when I kind of found out that he was right about management. They were really bad. They were kind of evil. Towards the tail end of the product release, Mindscape hired a hatchet man to replace the existing CEO. A colleague brought in an article where the gentleman, the new CEO, had performed his task of taking apart companies and selling their remaining assets. The article from a Midwest community paper asked the question, where is he now? He was here. I had heard that working for a game company at the time was very dysfunctional and unpleasant. And that was certainly the case. Oh, if you just think about the people that you work around, it was great. Some of the structure above was not to my palate. Since then, I've started several companies, got VC funded and everything else. And I can tell you, you hear all these stories about VCs and everything else, that this functionality that we're talking about at Mindscape is several times magnitudes of anything I've experienced since then. Movie day was infamous. We all got to go to the movie theater next door. And then we got back. Some of us had a job. Some of us didn't. There was pink slips on the desks. Yeah. There was a lot of sniping. I think somebody, when they saw how this was taking shape, somebody wanted to push Scott out of the way and take over and be in charge of it. The other vice presidents claimed that we did not know what we were doing and claimed that the whole thing was a con job. It turned out that the entire project and my managers and their managers were all very, very, very nice. And they said, well, let's see what they've got. And if they don't have something by Monday, we're going to fire everybody and put these new guys in charge. Well, the next Monday came by and we gave them a demo and blew their socks off. We beat them soundly. But it was not a fun kind of project from the Mindscape corporate point of view. And if that wasn't enough, it was about to get even worse. Of release. The bonus was based on the pro forma estimate of how many products would be sold. Normally at that time, a good sale was around 10,000 units to a high of 100,000 units. Lego Island sold 7 million units. The bonuses would have been pretty substantial. And then when they realized on the very first day that it was going to cost them a lot of money, they fired the team. They laid us off the entire... I was actually out on vacation at the time and they just laid us, everybody off. Which, you know, saddened all of us. In fact, it angered many of us. And we ended up taking the Mindscape to court and we won. And so a lot of those people got some money back, but nobody got the bonuses that they deserve. So that was, if you ask me, that's fairly criminal. They claimed that Mindscape wasn't going to make any more games like that. Of course, later I think they did. I think they just didn't want to pay. Which was very sad. We had another game, another set of games. We had two games planned out. They were going to be fantastic. And Lego was very excited by it. I think that they were shocked to find out that Mindscape was so unscrupulous. When they saw what they did, ultimately, it was like, oh, geez, you guys. So they wanted to get the rights back. And Mindscape struck a deal that effectively paid for all of Mindscape's development costs on Lego Island, plus Mindscape got to keep royalties. So it made Lego Island pure profit for Mindscape at that point. We're very sorry that these things didn't happen. We're very sorry that management turned out to be a bunch of... I'll try and think of a better name than the one that keeps coming through my head. The way that I viewed it was they had the goose that was laying the golden eggs. And they decided that they liked pâté. So what can you say? But arguably, Lego Island's biggest impact was proving to Lego that video games were a way forward. Yeah, it all comes back to Star Wars. After Lego Island's success, Lego was fully bought in, founding an entire division dedicated to publishing video games. Since then, a new Lego game has been released every single year, usually more than one. Over the years, that's added up to over 100 Lego video games, spanning several genres, several demographics, and several generations. And they all, to some extent, owe their existence to Lego Island. But for the game's tireless creators, its release was mostly bittersweet. They realized that the product put them on the map for a better sale of the company. Later that day, at the E3 awards ceremony, one of the VPs accepted the award for Best of the Show, Kid's Title. He said, I'd like to thank the team that created this product, but we fired them. I like a good joke too. Mindscape might have fired the team that brought the millions of dollars, but for many of them, that wasn't the last time they worked together. We started working together and just kept at it. We're all over the map, if you ever listen to our stuff. We have no focus. No focus, no commercial potential. Dennis and I, we both went off to found a company called Big Fix that later on, we sold to IBM. But mostly, a lot of us went on to do The Sims. SimCity 3, SimCity 4, SimCity 4 Expansion Pack, Tiger Woods Golf, and a bunch of variations of that. We ended up working on so many projects. They start melding together. Just a great team of people. Dave Cherry and I and Tara were all at Burning Man in like 1996 or 7. The people that I worked with, I go in every day and we had fun. You know, I didn't go to work. I went to fun. That's what the game was about. And if we weren't having fun, how the heck were the kids going to have fun? You know, all the problems, all the politics, be damned. We're making a fun game and we're having fun doing it. I didn't think this long after it that people would still be talking about it. I think that's pretty nifty. I like that. We knew that we were doing everything that we could possibly do to make it a classic. But just because you want to do that doesn't mean it's going to happen. The idea that it could last this long, that actually warms your heart because it means that putting your all into it can pay off. We were lucky to get that group of people together. I don't think it's going to be easy to get a group like that together again. And what about the man who started it all, Wes Jenkins? Well, after a brief stint working for Sierra Online, he ended up being offered a job by LEGO themselves. LEGO was really fond of Wes. They got it. They understood Wes as well. But working for LEGO required him to live in Europe, specifically the LEGO Media offices in London. And there were factors that soon arose that made it hard to live overseas. We were in the trenches and so we all were good buddies and we stayed good buddies for a long time. He ran into a lot of health problems after LEGO Island. In 2000, Wes Jenkins was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Over the years, as his condition worsened, he was forced to leave his position at LEGO. Eventually, he became bedridden and unable to work at all. So we did what we could to try and help him out, but ultimately he succumbed to heart problems and problems with his circulatory system. And I miss him terribly. Life was not kind to him, though, toward the end, and it was really sad to see that, to see that all happening. Wes was, he was a cartoon character. He was just such a neat ass. Just full of creativity. Wes was the driving comedic force in this game. I even saw myself just yesterday, just because somebody mentioned a name, Joaquin. Joaquin was a character in LEGO Island. Joaquin the dog. I know, right? It's like silly. The two ambulance people, they were like Dr. Seuss, like pull me, push you kind of things, you know? Wes was all about that. He was just a genius. And he was not well respected because he was very self-deprecating. And I remember he drove the crappiest little car. He was like the big man on the team. And people kind of took him for, when he was self-deprecating, they went along with his self-assessment. It was like, no, that's not right, you guys. That blowhard over there, he's the guy that you should be looking down on. This guy who's talking humbly about himself, this is the guy who is the genius. And it was hard. We all had to help sell him. Because once we knew what a genius he was, everybody else was listening to him saying, oh, you know, I'm just as humble, whatever. And he wasn't. He was fantastic. I think a lot of the whole personality of LEGO Island was Wes. Yeah, that was Wes. If you know the game, you know Wes. After listening to all these stories, it suddenly clicked why I was still so fond of this game after all this time. I mean, I'll be the first to admit that LEGO Island is not a game for adults. The gameplay is simplistic and honestly a little underwhelming. The challenge is pretty low outside of dealing with the clunky controls. And the campaign, if you can call it that, can be completed by even the most casual gamer in less than 45 minutes. But there was always just something about it. A line that still made me laugh. A song that still got stuck in my head. The memory of looking out over this tiny island, yet still seeing a world of endless possibilities. I didn't know it at the time, but what I was feeling was the drive and passion behind every aspect of the game. The true labor of love that was more than the sum of its parts. I played a lot of games when I was a kid, but very few of them made an impact the way LEGO Island did. A game that never talked down to you and made you feel like you were an important part of the world. I doubt you'd feel this way if you didn't grow up with it. But the fact is, we care about LEGO Island because as kids, I felt like LEGO Island cared about us. We were looking at something from Howard Gardner. Howard Gardner did multiple intelligences. And the idea was that there's not a single IQ. There's not just being smart or not being smart. There's being musical. There's being able to write. There's being able to do math. There's all these different things that people can do. And so we purposely took it into our head that each of the characters in LEGO Island would have a different kind of intelligence. The idea that kids should be judged by a single metric, I think, is hugely damaging to them. The kid who can read fast and do the math, you know, he gets good grades. The one who can't do it gets poor grades. It doesn't necessarily mean that that's not the genius in that class. So if you find out when you're a kid that you've got a poor IQ or something, you might have a bad self-opinion, but you might be a musical genius. And it's like, that's all you need. You know, find out what it is that's your thing and make it your thing. And don't let anybody grind you down with some other notions of what it is to be intelligent or what it is to be smart or any of that stuff, because everybody's got their special secret sauce. And that's kind of what we really wanted the kids to do. We wanted the kids to feel that this was a chance for them to build, to race, to shape the island, to make it theirs, to give them a voice in their own game and try and figure out how to get through life. It's not easy. Everybody's telling you what to do. And everybody's telling you what you are. And it's like, screw that. You are what you are. Figure it out. Be brave. Get out there. Find your own intelligence and go with it. And well, good luck. So Hey, thanks for watching. And thanks to my patrons and YouTube members for making this documentary possible. If you would like to help me make more like it in the future, please consider joining so I can keep investing my time into making bigger and better videos. Either way, I hope you have a great day and a great 2025, or if you're watching this in the future that you're gawking at how long ago 2025 was. Anyway, see you in the next one. The top story tonight, the Danish... Yeah? What are you doing? Oh, I'm recording a thing for Matt Casey. Oh, I like that guy. It's not about Lego Island again, is it?

How Hollow Knight Was Made and First Appeared on Newgrounds [kSAlVBFdC6k]:
Hollow Knight's origin story goes all the way back to August 2013, when two friends from Australia decided to enter a game jam together. Ari Gibson, a skilled animator, and William Pellen, an all-round designer, first met each other through mutual friends about ten years before development on Hollow Knight began. William used to be a web designer, but always had a passion for video games, so he started making games in his spare time. He made his first game called Return to Booty Grotto in October 2012 and published it on Newgrounds.com. After that, he made another game the next year called Lulanda, which he developed with Stencil, a tool designed to make games quick and easy. Just like Return to Booty Grotto, Lulanda can still be played on Newgrounds today. William had plans to turn his 2D platformer into a fully-fledged game, but he ran into technical issues since his game was getting too big for the software to handle. When William realized he would have to move to a different engine to keep the development going, he decided to let go of the project. While William was getting more familiar with game development, Ari was keeping himself busy with a wide variety of animation projects. He worked for the People's Republic of Animation and was involved with TV, short movies, commercials and video games. For example, Ari directed a cutscene for the Wii game The Blob. In 2012, he co-founded his own animation studio named Mechanical Apple and produced several award-winning animations. After being friends for many years and sharing a love for video games, especially Zelda 2, William and Ari agreed to join forces and started participating in game jams together. Game jams are an excellent way for developers to flex their skills and test their durability against stress, since you only have a very limited amount of time to complete and submit a game. In August of 2013, the 27th edition of Ludum Dare was held, a game jam community that's been around since 2002. Before Ari and William decided to enter, they invited Rohan Fraser, a talented artist that Ari knew through work, to join their team. These three developers formed the original members of Team Cherry. The theme for the 27th edition of Ludum Dare was 10 seconds and although Team Cherry was able to successfully create a game within the allotted time, it was arguably not very good. Hungry Knight was a simple top-down survival game where you had to slay insect-looking creatures and collect cherries every 10 seconds, otherwise the player character would perish. Unfortunately, the game wasn't very stable and was plagued with frame drops. When the team published Hungry Knight on the Newgrounds website, it received a user rating of 1 out of 5 stars. The predecessor to Hollow Knight is still playable today and nowadays the game has a user rating of 4 out of 5 stars. Even though Team Cherry didn't win the Ludum Dare game jam and gamers didn't seem to connect much to their first creation, Hungry Knight did lay the foundation for what was about to become a highly successful indie game. Especially Ari's compelling art style was something the team wanted to further explore. Before they would start development on Hollow Knight, Team Cherry took on two more game jams. About a month after Ludum Dare, the three developers participated in the indie speedrun 2013 game jam and the theme this time around was wealth, while their element was chosen to be mummy. Although they weren't able to finish their game TombCat in time for the game jam's deadline, Team Cherry still finished and published it on Newgrounds. The next Ludum Dare game jam took place in April 2014, with the theme that year being Beneath the Surface, a theme that would shape and refine the groundwork for Hollow Knight. Around the same time, Ari couldn't stop thinking about Hungry Knight and the protagonist they had created. Therefore, the small indie studio decided to combine Hungry Knight with the Beneath the Surface theme and it turned out to be a perfect match. Shortly after Ludum Dare, there was another jam with the theme Beneath the Surface, which we thought was really evocative. We missed the deadline for the jam but we kept talking about what sort of game we could make that would fit. We thought of the little insect knight exploring a deep old kingdom beneath the surface of the world and everything kinda snowballed from there. Not long after, Ari and William decided to quit their jobs and go all in with developing their first official video game. For the next couple of months, Ari and William were fully devoted to their new project and worked hard to get a proof of concept off the ground. Ari would take on the role of the game's art supervisor, while William would oversee the game's overall design. The title Hungry Knight was originally chosen because the character needed to eat cherries every ten seconds, but since that wasn't part of their new idea anymore, they decided to change it to Hollow Knight. When it came to choosing what engine to use, Team Cherry decided to take the Lulanda prototype that William had made with Stencil and adapted it to fit their needs for Hollow Knight. Both Ari and William knew they had to focus on the moment-to-moment mechanics first and this involved getting the movement of the player character just right. We wanted players to feel totally in control of their character at all times, so our model for movement was the Mega Man and Mega Man X series. The knight has no acceleration or deceleration on horizontal movement. The jump has a lot of initial lift, releasing the button cuts vertical speed quickly, and the dash completely arrests vertical movement, shooting you forward instantly. Any hit they take, or mistake they make, could have been avoided right up until the last second. It's a principle we tried to roll out through the rest of the game, but it all started with the knight's run and jump, the very first things to be coded. After the pair was satisfied with the knight's movements, they directed their attention to the theme that sparked it all, the place beneath the surface. Ari and William had this idea for a mysterious kingdom that had fallen from grace, which ended up becoming Hollow Nest. The game is heavily inspired by the Metroidvania genre and in those games one of the key elements is the map, so naturally designing the world of Hollow Knight became a major focus for the indie studio. However, they wanted to set it apart from other Metroidvania games and this became the most difficult design challenge throughout the whole development. The map and the mapping system took a long while to come together. We wanted players to feel like an explorer entering uncharted lands, so we knew that the map couldn't work in a Metroid-style way. It couldn't know the shape of the landscape before the player did, but it also couldn't be so unfriendly that a player would turn off the game in frustration. Their solution was to implement an NPC character that sells parts of the map, while also letting players expand the map themselves as they keep exploring. When the two developers figured out how to approach the map system from a mechanical standpoint, they still needed to make it visually appealing. The map in Hollow Knight almost looks like a maze, but Team Cherry was able to find a good balance between suggesting enough information and not overwhelming the player with details. To further emphasize a sense of discovery and exploration, the team focused on giving the player interesting things to stumble on, such as hidden characters, treasures and battles. A common criticism of Metroidvania games is the large amount of backtracking that's required. Players often have acquired more abilities at this point, making earlier areas in those games much easier and might cause the overall experience to deflate. Team Cherry was able to partially overcome this problem by making one of the starting areas of the game more dynamic, changing it as a player comes closer towards the ending. A lot of the art in the game was hand-drawn by Ari and scanned directly into the engine. I photographed them with my phone and cleaned them up on the computer. From there it's just adding pieces into the world until it feels full. Keep it simple was our visual goal. That mantra carried through to the rest of the art, and was probably integral in us being able to create such a larger world in two years. Ari and William had big ideas for Hollow Knight and without funding, or any form of income for that matter, they wouldn't be able to execute their full vision for the game. Therefore, when no less than five sections of the map were completed after about six months of development, the team felt it was time to try and take it to the next step and launch a Kickstarter. On November 18th, 2014, the Hollow Knight Kickstarter went live and the funding goal was set to $35,000 Australian dollars. While the Kickstarter ultimately shot past that goal with over $57,000 Australian dollars from more than 2,000 backers, Team Cherry only reached their funding goal three days before the Kickstarter was over. Near the end of the Kickstarter however, donations skyrocketed, so some of the more interesting stretch goals were funded, including a Wii U port and an additional playable character. Shortly after the launch of the Kickstarter, Rohan Fraser decided to depart from Team Cherry to focus more on his career as an animator and illustrator. Ari and William had now secured the future of Hollow Knight's development and were able to hire more people to help finish the 2D platformer. David Kazi was brought on board as a technical director to assist with coding the game, while Chris Larkin was hired to produce the game's music and sound effects. Chris had already worked with Ari once before, on one of Ari's short films called Motorbike. After the successful Kickstarter, the team was also able to afford office space and moved their studio to the city of Adelaide in South Australia. Besides funding the development, the Kickstarter was also a clear sign for Team Cherry that Hollow Knight resonated with gamers. It was the first signal, conceptually at least, that we were onto something cool. We ran a beta several months after that, which included the entire first area of the game, the Forgotten Crossroads. It was a stellar response to that area that really cemented our direction for Hollow Knight. Since the studio would now be porting the game to the Wii U, they needed an engine that was a bit more flexible. With the help of experienced programmer David Kazi, they were able to drop Stencil and upgrade to the Unity engine. Aside from better flexibility, the engine also allowed them to add more visual flair, which became apparent when the developers put the results side by side. Hollow Knight was originally scheduled to release in June 2015 and back then the team estimated that the game would only be around 2 to 3 hours long. Thanks to the success of the Kickstarter however, the team was able to drastically expand the scope and add more content. For example, the developers added a lot more areas to explore in the kingdom of Hallownest. More areas also meant more different kinds of enemies and bosses, which took a huge chunk of time to develop. Ari was mainly responsible for all the art in the game and he has said that many of the character designs were done on the fly and started with a single sketch. Because of time constraints, he wasn't able to iterate on most of his designs, so whatever he drew in his sketchbook would go straight into the game. Sketches like these, while seriously crude, formed the basis for most of the game. To date, I've filled three sketchbooks for Hollow Knight. Almost everything within makes its way into the final game. Very little is wasted. Most of these sketches are produced on Thursday nights, at a cafe meetup of local artists. The sketches produced during that event tend to cover about a week's worth of final work. Once Ari had drawn a sketch, he would place it into Photoshop to make a digital version and animate it in Photoshop as well. This whole process could take up to a week for a boss character, but for a normal enemy, Ari was able to do it much faster, sometimes in less than two hours, including programming the enemy in Unity. To streamline this process, Team Cherry used a plugin for Unity called Playmaker. This plugin provides a visual programming system through the use of flowcharts, making it much easier to understand how to implement things like the enemy AI. William, with a basic knowledge of coding, was now able to program a lot of the enemy behavior himself, giving David more time to focus on other programming tasks. In the end, a total of 149 enemy characters were created for the base version of the game, with over 30 of them being bosses. It is worth noting that a lot of the art was conceived in collaboration with William, who was normally very busy constructing the game's systems, but occasionally he would come up with his own character designs. The cartographer is one of those designs. Ari added that Hollow Knight's overall look and feel is really a middle ground between him and William, including elements like lore and dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, both Ari and William are responsible for all the text in the game. They always had a basic plot planned out for Hollow Knight, but much of the lore was added organically as the team added more content. The final version of the script ended up being around 20,000 words long and was all written in a Google spreadsheet. Hollow Knight was influenced by many different titles, such as Metroid, Castlevania, Zelda 2, Faxanadu and the aforementioned Mega Man X. Furthermore, the badge system that's present in the game was directly inspired by Paper Mario. One of the more interesting and unique mechanics originated from an interview where Team Cherry was asked what happens to the player when they die. We said something like, oh, it'll be a great surprise, and then after the interview we realized we hadn't actually considered that yet. We'd already completed the knight's death animation, which ends with his head falling to the ground and cracking. We thought it might be interesting if you had to travel back to the place you died, find the skull and crack it open to regain your money. Then we kicked around some ideas about the skull being possessed by an enemy or suddenly fighting back, which seemed really funny. This evolved into the idea of leaving behind a ghost of your previous life that attacks you, which eventually became the shade that you encounter in the final game. This is a really good example of a simple mechanical idea we made early on that seemed inconsequential at the time, ending up having a huge impact on the lore and the history and the nature of the character you play as, which happened a lot. As mentioned before, the game's music was performed by Chris Larkin, who was given a lot of freedom and support by Team Cherry. The main instruments Chris used were the piano and the viola, and he worked on the soundtrack on and off for about two years, giving him plenty of time to refine the musical themes in Hollow Knight. Since the narrative becomes more clear as you progress in the world of Hallownest, Chris wanted to reflect this in the soundtrack, which is why he decided to implement leitmotifs. Leitmotifs are more commonly used in film and opera, and Chris describes it as a short melodic phrase that gets used in certain places or themes. In Hollow Knight, this translates to certain melodies coming back later in the game to connect specific areas and themes. Although there's no real spoken dialogue in the game, there are a lot of voices attached to characters, and most of those were done by William, Ari and someone Team Cherry shared an office with. That someone is Makoto Koji, who runs her own animation studio called Paper Rabbits, and she provided about 90% of the female voices. Some of the rest of the voiceover work was performed by friends and families of the developers. As the team came closer to the end of Hollow Knight's development, they hired Matthew Griffin to market the game. Matthew reached out to streamers and content creators to play and cover Hollow Knight, in order to create as much word of mouth as possible. He also set up a deal with Fangamer to help release Hollow Knight related merchandise. Additionally, he also scheduled many interviews with news outlets. While Team Cherry had already created quite a lot of word of mouth through Kickstarter and the many blog updates about Hollow Knight's development on Team Cherry's website, it was still crucial to create as much buzz as possible right before the game's release. The small indie studio's reputation, and possibly their future, all relied on whether or not Hollow Knight would go on to become a success. While their original Kickstarter goal was set to $35,000 Australian dollars, their estimated final budget for the game was between $90,000 and $100,000 Australian dollars, which was well over the amount of money they ultimately received from Kickstarter and PayPal donations. Because of this, the developers were forced to take out a loan to cover some of the development costs. During the course of development, Team Cherry had to make some drastic changes, sometimes even cutting huge chunks of content that were already implemented in the game. A good example of this is an area that was called the Bone Forest. It was a huge later game area filled with lava. Cutting it was tough at the time. It seemed so cool, but it was totally the right thing to do. William and I were already slammed with all the other enormous areas to build and they all would have suffered for Bone Forest inclusion. A major part of development was spent balancing the difficulty, especially towards the end when more testers were brought in to play the game. To get more accurate feedback, they used free applications like Trello to provide a way to highlight bugs and other problems. Some testers described the game's difficulty as pitch perfect, while others said it was punishingly difficult. From the beginning of development, Team Cherry leaned more on making the game easier through various ways, such as guiding players clearly, offering help through characters in the world and the general flow of the game. Another smaller example is the slash size of the knight. The slash has been growing through all of development and it just keeps going. It's grown to the point where you can sometimes whack enemies through walls and ceilings, and that's great. We're huge fans of small game breaks that allow players to cheat their way towards victory. The promised Wii U version was eventually dropped in favor for a Nintendo Switch version. By early 2017, it was clear that the Wii U was at the end of its life cycle, so it made much more sense to port the game to Nintendo's newest console. Yet it was still a difficult decision that Team Cherry had to make, since they promised Kickstarter backers a Wii U port. Luckily, by the time the Switch version was released, many backers had already moved over to the newer hybrid console. After almost three years of development, Hollow Knight was released on PC on the 24th of February 2017, followed by the Mac and Linux versions later that year on the 11th of April. The game received universal praise from critics and gamers with many reviewers calling Hollow Knight a masterpiece. Everything from the combat to the lore seemed to click with gamers around the world and it didn't take long for the game to sell half a million copies. After its release, there was still a lot of work left to be done. For starters, Team Cherry was still hard at work to finish the Nintendo Switch port. Fortunately, they were able to hire another Australian studio, called Jumpshark Studios, who helped to rework the game's code for the Switch. The original plan was to release Hollow Knight on the Switch shortly after its release, but the team had to delay the game to June 12th, 2018. That day, Nintendo's E3 direct presentation took place and during the presentation it was announced that Hollow Knight would be available to purchase later that day. The Switch version was surprisingly popular, with 250,000 copies selling two weeks after its release. Besides the Switch port, the studio was also figuring out how to implement a second playable character that was funded during the Kickstarter. During this story, you meet a character called Hornet and Team Cherry intended to make her a playable character in an upcoming DLC pack for Hollow Knight. However, in February 2019, it was announced that Hollow Knight would get a fully-fledged sequel called Silksong and that Hornet would be the main character. Between the game's release and the announcement of a sequel, Team Cherry worked on many updates to optimize the game and even released four free DLC packs. Hidden Dreams, The Grimm Troop, Lifeblood and the final DLC pack Godmaster all provided fresh new content, such as new boss encounters, new quests, new music tracks, new enemies, new charms and so on. This kept the experience fresh for veteran players and gave new players all the more reason to pick up and play Hollow Knight. In 2018, the game was eventually ported to Xbox and PlayStation as well, with official physical editions of the game coming out in 2019. In February 2019, Team Cherry revealed that Hollow Knight had sold over 2.8 million copies. Thanks to this overwhelming success and with Silksong on the horizon, Team Cherry is able to keep living their dream and make video games for a living. Our goal was always to get ourselves into a position where we could just keep making stuff and we're grateful we've gotten there thanks to everyone's support. Defining success back then was easy. It was just selling enough to be able to make another game. Had we achieved only that, we would have been happy.

How Untitled Goose Game Was Made and Inspired by Hitman [ZpZZ49-ifJw]:
Today, we're talking about a goose, a very specific goose among all the geese and one that might be the most famous goose on the internet. I'm referring to the goose that was made by House House, an independent game development studio based in Australia. Their newest release, Untitled Goose Game, starring the world famous goose, has become not only a highly successful video game, but also a new internet sensation. But how did a game about a simple goose became such a hit you might ask? Let's have a look. After House House had finished work on their latest game, Push Me, Pull You, back in 2016, the four developers were chatting away about what to do next. A very important and serious discussion for a small independent studio. Their livelihood depends on it after all. Designer Stuart Gillespie Cook thought the same and ignited the conversation with a stock photo of a goose. Many things were said about geese, some complimentary things and some that weren't, but they all agreed that geese were an interesting and funny species. At first, they wrote the idea off as a joke. Making a game about a goose seemed too silly. So, they turned their attention to other more serious ideas and for several months they were making prototypes to see which ideas had potential. They knew they wanted to make a single player 3D game, but the progress was too slow to their liking. It probably didn't help that they couldn't shake the goose game idea and kept making jokes about it. Jokes that became funnier and funnier. So, they decided to take it seriously and just go for it. What's the worst that could happen? Putting your livelihood on the line for a game about a goose might have seemed crazy to many, but maybe it was crazy enough to work. Since the entire idea was sparked by a simple stock photo of a goose, they didn't have much of a plan at the start. You need gameplay, art assets, music, perhaps a compelling story and so much more to build a game. All they had was a goose. The jokes they made did lay the foundation of the game and they knew the premise had to be about a naughty goose, one that people would be afraid of and would create conflict. During the course of the prototyping phase, the developers experimented with funny things that a goose could do and focused on the relationship between the NPC characters and their goose. They quickly realized that the low-level relationship between a goose and a person was really interesting and really rich and had all this opportunity for depth, nuance and humor. A very early prototype was a rough version of the garden with a few props in it. The man overseeing the garden cared about the props and the goose could pick them up. The team realized they had something special on their hands when they noticed how funny it was when the goose and the man would keep eye contact in total silence. And just having those two characters look at each other. The world was totally bare, it was pretty rough and early, but having two characters look at each other in silence had all this stuff in it. Just that eye contact creates this relationship that you can put so much meaning into. House House took inspiration from both Super Mario 64 and Hitman. The inspiration for Mario was rooted in his fun, expressive moveset, told developer Nico Dieseldorp to Gamersutra. Furthermore, he said that Mario's controls can do a lot of interesting things and that it's fun to press different buttons and make Mario's body move in different ways. So they tried to replicate this concept for their main character, the goose. Another developer, Jacob Strasser, mentioned that the idea of having a to-do list was loosely based on the list of Power Stars from Super Mario 64. The inspiration from Hitman came from wanting to create small moments of mischief. Because of this, they naturally started to gravitate towards stealth games, where the player might know things that the other characters on the screen don't know. We realized it was very rich for the kinds of comedic moments that we were trying to add to our game. It has a setup and a punchline. By removing the violence from it, we just let the situations exist as a joke. During an interview with Nintendo Life, the team said that the eye-catching art style was influenced by children's TV programs from the UK, such as Postman Pat, Fireman Sam and Brum. The townsfolk were even modeled after the faceless miniature people from shows like Thomas the Tank Engine. The inspiration for this setting unsurprisingly came from the UK as well. There's something about the kind of properness of an English village that seems to be the antithesis of what The Goose was all about. If The Goose was going to be chaotic and making a mess, then the natural foil seemed to be these people who wanted to preserve order. The idea that began as a joke actually started to become a funny game in and of itself and the team grew fonder and fonder of their silly goose game. Still, when it came down to showing their game to the public, they didn't feel all that confident. To them it may have been a funny idea, but would gamers actually be excited about playing a game as a goose? When they were about to reveal the game for the first time at the annual Independent Games Festival Fantastic Arcade in Austin, Texas, they realized the festival didn't have a website, meaning people on the internet wouldn't be able to discover their game. They quickly needed to put something online before the start of the festival, although this time, a stock photo probably wouldn't cut it. They pieced together a trailer and everything was set to post it on their YouTube channel. But wait, they didn't have a title yet and they didn't want to just slap Goose Game on their video game. To avoid confusion, they posted the video with the title Untitled Goose Game and decided to come up with something else later down the line. By putting Untitled in the title, they were sure people would realize this wasn't going to be the actual title of the game, that's what Untitled means of course. Brilliant, they thought. Except, the internet didn't quite agree and accepted a placeholder title with open arms. Even more so, the internet deemed the trailer worthy of meme status. It wasn't generally looked at as a traditional video game trailer and instead was being shared around as a meme video. Within a matter of hours, the trailer had been watched half a million times and people were retweeting it with great vigor. Later that day it even reached the number one spot on Reddit. House House took notice and after some time they felt comfortable with the placeholder title. After all, the internet was showing love because the game was so unique and memorable in every aspect, including the title. Changing it now might have even hurt the game in the process. Later the team confessed they never really came up with anything else, except for one title, some like It Honk, but they said it was never a viable option. Like I said before, it wasn't really a traditional video game trailer. Most trailers have cool CG footage, riveting gameplay moments, interesting story beats that leave you wanting more and so on. Again, their trailer had none of that. Just a goose, running around annoying perfectly normal people that were trying to get on with their perfectly normal lives. To the everyday person on the internet, it looked like a funny video they could easily share with their friends and family, and so people did. A lot of people. Right up until the release on September 20th. That's when it really started to take off. To gamers, Untitled Goose Game looked like something different, something they hadn't really seen before. On the surface it may have looked like another simulator game, but once you dig a little deeper people noticed there was an actual game there. A game with objectives, gameplay mechanics and even a fun little storyline. Combined with the striking art style and catchy music, it helped sell the concept to those familiar playing games. And to those unfamiliar, it piqued their interest once they saw some funny gameplay being shared on their social media platform of choice. So gamers and non-gamers alike started to take notice in a big way. An ideal situation for any indie developer. Critics were loving the game as well, complimenting several aspects of the game and many reviews concluded that Untitled Goose Game wasn't just a meme, it was actually a very good game to boot. The Washington Post even declared it a safe, socially acceptable way to relieve stress. It's the new punching a wall. It's the new crying at your desk. House House had created the perfect recipe for success. Not only had they made a game that was very shareable and likeable on the internet, they had also put in the time and effort to actually make it enjoyable to play. After the reviews, word of mouth started to spread quickly and not only that, more and more memes started making the rounds on the internet. Besides all the memes, some people went a step further and made some amazing fan art that caught many people's attention. Dedicated social media accounts were being created, like this one that mashes up Untitled Goose Game with popular movies. It's still active to this day. One Twitch streamer even went as far as dressing up as a goose and played the game with a custom controller he had built himself. It involved a lot of sensors and looked a bit like this. The game was building quite a passionate fanbase for itself. At this point House House was probably thinking, this is it. This is the height of popularity. What else could possibly drive even more word of mouth? Well, the game had caught so much attention already that even celebrities started to discover it. Lo and behold, some of them even started to endorse it without being paid for it. Mark Hoppus, the frontman for Blink-182, gave the game a shout out during one of his concerts. Chrissy Teigen started tweeting about it, giving it her shining approval. This was the kind of marketing force that most developers can't even afford. It was clear that none could escape the goose. But wait a second, September 20th, that's the same release date as the remake of The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening, one of Nintendo's flagship titles that year. Surely Untitled Goose Game would get lost in a shuffle on the Switch online store because of this. Well, it turns out that all the memes, fanart and celebrity endorsement was enough to beat Link and his Awakening on its own platform. It took the number one spot on the Nintendo store sales chart and this, of course, drove people to start making memes about that, which in turn drove even more sales. The Goose was unstoppable and was showing up everywhere and by now, everyone and their grandma had heard about it. The end of 2019 was in sight and The Goose Game was snatching up award nominations left and right. But what was arguably better than those nominations was the attention it got at the Game Awards. A whole segment was dedicated to The Goose, mashing it with the humor of the Muppets. That year, the Game Awards was also especially popular, racking up more than 45 million global live streams. That's a lot of people and most of them agreed The Goose segment was the best part of the whole show. A couple of days after the awards show, on the 17th of December to be exact, the game was released for both PS4 and Xbox. Every platform was now catered to, except for a huge chunk of PC players who will get the Steam version later in 2020, but despite that, the game managed to hit a huge milestone before the end of 2019. In just three months time, the indie developed Goose Game passed a million sales. While the game was already a hit on the internet, this milestone proved that it was more than just another internet sensation and that House House had crafted something that people genuinely wanted to play and experience. The developers at House House were taken by surprise that their game had took off the way it did and told Game Industry that they didn't expect all the praise from gamers and critics, let alone the high sales numbers. We thought The Goose was our joke. It felt like an in-joke. Then we very quickly realized how many people, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, have strong feelings about Geese. I want to say it's because it's a largely unnoticed part of people's lives, so drawing attention to it is very satisfying in the way a joke can be. They also shared their own idea of why they thought the game was getting so much attention and why it struck a chord with so many players. It's very easy to look at a screenshot of this game and immediately gauge what the conflict is. I think The Goose character allows people to be the source of mischief that lots of people desire being in video games. In this game you're told to go in there and make as big a mess as possible. Thanks to the huge number of sales, Nicol Dieseldorp commented that it was now possible for the studio to keep on making games for as long as they like. Whether that means we'll see a sequel or perhaps DLC remains to be seen, but we can all take comfort in the fact that this quirky game studio is going to keep doing what it does best and deliver charmingly funny game experiences.

How Undertale Was Made and Why its Success Scared The Creator [NIIx3gmLdpA]:
You kill a lot of random monsters, sometimes even humans, in every RPG and the consequences for this are never addressed. What if they were? This is the question that sparked the idea for the indie game Undertale, an RPG made by Toby Fox, who did all the writing, programming, music and some of the art for the game. The rest of the artwork is done by one of its friends Tammy Chang and a few other artists that are credited on the Kickstarter campaign for Undertale. Toby deliberately wanted to keep the team as small as possible, as he believes the bigger a development team gets, the more diluted the game becomes. One of Undertale's biggest influences goes back to when Toby was only four years old, which is when he started playing EarthBound on the Super Nintendo and this early gaming experience had a lasting impression on him. I was so young that it helped me learn to read and also transformed my brain forever. Seven years later, Toby discovered the EarthBound fansite Starman.net and now he finally had a place to talk and connect with other EarthBound fans. A few of his friends from the fansite now run the Fangamer website, which sells Toby's Undertale merchandise. In the year 2000, Toby and his three brothers started playing around with the RPG Maker 2000 tool to make roleplaying games. He said they barely finished any of them and none of them were ever released on the internet. When he was in high school, Toby created quite a few EarthBound ROM hacks as well and the most notable one is the Halloween hack that he released in 2008 on the Starman website. Besides keeping his love for EarthBound alive during high school, Toby also started playing the piano and trumpet, which in turn sparked his love for composing music. Fast forward to his time in college, where Toby started putting together the building blocks for his first real video game project. He initially didn't start with a concrete idea for either the story or gameplay and the first piece of inspiration actually came from Wikipedia. One day, I randomly read about arrays and realized I could program a text system using them. So, I decided to make a battle system using that text system, which in turn gave me many ideas for a game. Then I decided to make a demo of that game, to see if people liked it and if it was humanly possible to create. This combat system was also further inspired by Shin Megami Tensei, where the player can talk to demon enemies in order to recruit them. It always interested me that you could talk to monsters to avoid conflicts, but the conversations were often kind of repetitive and if you screwed them up, fighting became your only option. I wanted to create a system that satisfied my urge for talking to monsters. Toby felt that it was important to make every monster feel like an individual. He further said that basically all monsters in RPGs like Final Fantasy are the same, besides the actual designs of the enemies. They attack you, you heal, you attack them, they die. There's no meaning to that. Toby's experimental text-based combat system was made in GameMaker 8 and the developer would use an upgraded version of this engine called GameMaker Studio and later GameMaker Studio 2 for the rest of Undertale's development. However, Toby also used GameMaker 8 to create a demo for Undertale. As for Undertale's core concept, Toby wanted to make an RPG, but he wanted it to be different from all the games he grew up with. I wanted to make an RPG game where you could befriend all of the bosses, where not killing everything is actually a viable option. If you think about it, most RPGs are endless murder fests. How many monsters do you kill and to what end? Everything sort of naturally arose from that concept. Now that he had settled on an engine and had a core concept for the game, it was time to start sketching characters and craft a story. During this part of the development process, his love for the EarthBound series definitely had an influence on some of the characters and the writing. I can definitely say that I wanted to make something that had as much emotional power, humor and wonder as the mother games, while not necessarily taking the same paths to achieve it. Also, the main character is a kid wearing a striped shirt. That's probably too obvious. Although Toby looked to the mother series as a main source of inspiration, Undertale ended up becoming something very different compared to most RPGs and that was no accident. Toby wanted to challenge conventional RPG mechanics and tropes and fully embrace the video game medium. He said he's very tired of traditional JRPGs and wanted to see one that's not boring to play. One that has interesting characters and utilizes the medium as a storytelling device as much as possible, instead of having the story and gameplay abstractions be completely separate. An example of this is the character Toriel, who serves as a sort of guide for the player during the first moments of the game. Make no mistake though, Toby deliberately depicted Toriel as an overprotective mother to poke fun at tutorial levels found in many modern games. However, Toby also gave Toriel a more important role, since he feels that mother characters in games have seen a decline. There really aren't enough mother characters in RPG games. In Pokemon, Mother, Mother 2, there's this trope of having mothers be there only to say goodbye to their 10-year-old kid as they go out into the world. They're basically just symbols rather than characters. Even Mother 3's mother character, Inawa, doesn't really show up very much in the scheme of things. So here is Toriel, a mom that hopefully acts like a mom. She won't let you explore a dangerous world by yourself, because she genuinely cares about your well-being. As previously mentioned, most of the art was done by Toby and Temmie Chang. While Toby had final say over all the artwork, Temmie is credited as the logo designer, cutscene artist, overworld artist, animator, shop artist and tile artist. Furthermore, she's also responsible for the conception of a couple of the characters, Lux, Vegetoid, Papyrus, Lesser Dog, Greater Dog, Undyne and Eren. Both developers have visual representations of themselves in the game, with the annoying dog representing Toby and the monster called Temmie representing Temmie Chang. All the art was done in Microsoft Paint and Graphics Scale. The retro pixel art made it easier for Toby to contribute his own designs, but that's not the only reason pixel art was used. Even if I had a team of 100 artists, I probably wouldn't want it to look any different. Visual gags usually benefit from funny expressive drawings. One of the creepier characters, Flowey, has a voice line in the game. This voice clip actually comes from a McDonald's commercial that was made in the 60s. Ronald McDonald can be heard saying the line to a group of children. Obviously, Toby adjusted the clip to make it sound more disturbing. When it came to the storytelling and writing, Toby once again drew inspiration from the unsettling world of EarthBound, as well as more silly things like internet culture and funny shows like Mr. Bean. The idea of being trapped in an underground world was partially influenced by the game Brandish. The developer struggled with the parts of writing that aren't text, but once he had established the character's voice and mood, writing scenes became easier. As stated earlier, Toby already made a combat system of sorts before anything else, but it would take up a lot more time to polish and refine his unique take on turn-based battles. While expanding this battle system, Toby took inspiration from the Mario and Luigi RPG games and bullet hell shooters like Toho Project. It might seem strange at first to combine a turn-based combat system with real-time shooter elements, but Toby explained that he wanted to do something different than he was already familiar with. He also said that bullets offer more variety in movement than simple button presses. Even though the combat is inspired by the bullet hell genre, Toby didn't want it to become as difficult as those games, so that more people would be willing to play and enjoy Undertale. He managed to accomplish this by using fewer and larger projectiles and he would keep iterating on his bullet patterns until Toby thought they were tough but fair. Furthermore, he let some of his friends, who did not have much or any experience with bullet hell shooters, test out the combat and saw that they were able to complete it without too much effort. All of this combined convinced Toby that the game's difficulty was just right. During development, it was very important to him to make a game that he would personally enjoy playing and not necessarily create something with mainstream appeal. That's why there's no fetch quests or backtracking present in Undertale for example, since Toby personally dislikes those tropes in video games. A trope that Toby is a fan of is the silent protagonist trope. The character doesn't say very much because then you can identify with them better. Most of the game's narration is in the second person. The more details and personality I add to you, then the harder it is to get absorbed into the role. Players in Undertale have the choice to either spare or kill the monsters they encounter and this mechanic was established before Toby wrote any of the story. While the solo developer wanted to keep Undertale fairly easy to complete, he did make a conscious decision to make it harder to befriend enemies and bosses than to slay them in battle. In games, I noticed that the good path was sometimes the easiest one, but if you do things without effort, then it doesn't feel meaningful. Being a musician, Toby didn't have to think twice about composing the soundtrack for Undertale himself. He even went so far as to give all the main characters their own theme song. Most of these theme songs were created specifically for each character, except for the ones for the brothers Sans and Papyrus. Sans' theme song, Megalovania, was composed by Toby back in 2008 for the aforementioned Halloween Earthbound romhack. Papyrus' theme song, Bone Trousle, was actually composed for another game that Toby had worked on but that game never saw a release. The entire Undertale soundtrack was made in FL Studio. According to Toby, he was able to compose most of the tracks without much iteration, except for the game's main theme, which went through multiple iterations. When working on the soundtrack, Toby said that he tried to be inspired by all the music he listens to, but he was particularly inspired by the music from SNES roleplaying games. Additionally, a webcomic called Homestuck, which Toby had produced music for, also influenced Undertale's music. The developer created the music before he would start programming, as it would help him decide how a scene should unfold. The official soundtrack would be released by video game music label Materia Collective on the same day as the game's release. In June 2013, Toby launched a Kickstarter campaign for Undertale in the hopes to receive some funding to finish his vision for the unconventional RPG. The funding goal was set to a very reasonable sum of $5,000 and by the end of the campaign, Toby received more than 10 times the amount he had initially asked for. In addition to promising an RPG where no one has to get hurt, Toby also provided a demo on the Kickstarter page that anyone could download and try. Several of the available Kickstarter tiers provided a way for backers to create their own characters and enemies that would be added to the game. Toby decided to buy three of these designs and they became Glide, Muffet and So Sorry. Some people on the internet had suggested that Undertale was supposed to be a very short indie game, but Toby said otherwise. I was just unsure if it was humanly possible to create it before making the demo. The reason it was bigger than expected is because my expectations of the areas, battles and so on, increased a lot after making the demo. The Kickstarter page also provided an estimated release date of summer 2014, but Toby had to eventually delay the game to September 15th, 2015, when it was released for Microsoft Windows and macOS. When people got their hands on Undertale, they became fascinated with its characters and the many secrets it holds, not to mention the meta nature of the game, which added a whole other level to the many discussions people were having on the internet. People desperately wanted to talk about this strange new RPG and how their experience differentiated from others. Because of this, the game quickly achieved a sort of cult status among gamers. Add a lot of very positive reviews to the mix and you have a recipe for a successful indie game story. Before the end of 2015, Undertale managed to sell over 500,000 copies on Steam and not long after, in February 2016, the game had sold over one million copies. After the initial release, Toby kept working on the game and released an update in January 2016, which fixed several bugs and helped make the game more playable for colorblind people by changing the appearance of blue attacks to a darker hue. During E3 2017, Sony had the honor of announcing that Undertale would not only be receiving a port on PS4 and PS Vita, but also a Japanese localization plus a retail version provided by Fangamer. They sold both a standard and collector's edition and are still available to buy today. During a Nintendo Direct in March 2018, a Nintendo Switch version was announced, although no further details were given at the time. Prior to its reveal, it was impossible for developers to directly export games made in Game Maker Studio to the Switch. However, shortly after the Nintendo Direct, it was revealed that a deal was struck between Nintendo and software development company YoYo Games that would make it possible to export Game Maker Studio games directly to the Nintendo Switch. Undertale on the Switch was eventually released on September 15th, 2018 in Japan and worldwide on September 18th, 2018. All the console ports were developed and published by Japanese localizer 8-4. Many critics praised the game for its innovative mechanics and progressive thinking, while also complimenting its unique characters and clever writing. As a result, Undertale appeared on several end-of-the-year lists in 2015 and even came out on top as Game of the Year for PC from news outlets and critics such as IGN, Zero Punctuation and Jim Sterling. TotalBiscuit even gave Undertale the number one spot in his Top 10 Games of 2015 video. The game was also nominated for a bunch of awards and was able to snatch up a few, like the Most Fulfilling Crowdfunded Game Award handed out by the South by Southwest Gaming Awards event in 2016. The success and popularity of Undertale was undeniable at this point, but Toby had mixed feelings about all the attention his game was receiving. "'Not only did I not expect this level of popularity, but initially I was afraid of it. I didn't want Undertale to become tiring for people or become spoiled before anyone even got a chance to play it. Early on, this was probably excessive. I even tried to contact certain let's players to tell them not to make any content about it. Like a thunderclap to a small dog, all of this attention stressed me out. At times I wished I had a way to quell the attention. I felt a strange powerlessness and guilt for feeling stressed when the success of the game should be something I'm nothing but ecstatic about." He further said that ultimately he's very thankful that the game became as popular as it did, since it helped him on a personal level and put him in a position to help other people as well. Toby personally attributes Undertale's success to the many risks it took and how different it is compared to more conventional RPGs. "'It takes influence from many strange sources. The graphics look bad in places. The gameplay is very simple. Most of all, the game's humor and surprise is derived from the fact that it defies the expected conventions of normal RPGs. That's the most interesting part to me, that even without understanding of the genre's conventions, the game still resonates with people, kids included. That's very cool." Luckily for Undertale fans, all the attention hasn't stopped Toby from continuing his career as a game developer. On October 31st, 2018, the first chapter of Toby's next project called Deltarune was released for Windows and MacOS and was made available for free. It was ported to Nintendo Switch and PS4 as well in 2019 and these versions were developed and published by 8-4. Gamers quickly noticed that Deltarune was an anagram of Undertale. However, according to Toby, Deltarune is not a direct sequel to Undertale nor does it even take place in the same world. "'I will say that basically, what you're seeing here is not the world of Undertale. Undertale's world and ending are the same as however you left them. To rephrase that, Deltarune's world is a different one, with different characters that have lived different lives. A whole new story will happen." The first chapter is between two to three hours long and serves more as a demo to gauge people's interest and see how Toby can take the project further. Despite its short length, the first chapter of Deltarune took a few years to create. Toby explained that this is in part because of Deltarune's more complicated graphics and overworld, implementation of multiple main characters and the fact that Toby had to create the entire town correctly on the first try, so he could set up the rest of the game properly. Furthermore, there were a couple of factors that were outside of his control. After Undertale's release, Toby had difficulty concentrating on other tasks and he even started to doubt himself and his capabilities as a developer. Toby further described it as a burnout. Additionally, the developer even admitted that it would be impossible to finish the game between him and Temmie Chang, since it's a much larger project than Undertale was. Alternatively, he added that it might be possible to complete Deltarune if he can assemble a Toby said that he's going to try his best to accomplish this, but even with an entire team, he's still uncertain when Deltarune will be released or if it will even ever see the light of day. However, according to his recent tweets, it seems like Deltarune is making good progress. Nevertheless, if Deltarune gets released, it will be a fully complete game, with all the chapters bundled together. One interesting detail that Toby shared is that Deltarune will only have one possible ending, as opposed to the dozens of endings that can be unlocked in Undertale. Toby realizes that expectations for his next project are really high and that he's never going to be able to make something like Undertale again. If you played Undertale, I don't think I can make anything that makes you feel that way again. However, it's possible I can make something else. It's just something simple, but maybe you'll like it. Ultimately, Toby is just happy that Undertale resonated with gamers and is being enjoyed around the world. He hopes that his game might inspire other aspiring developers. I hope someday a kid who liked Undertale grows up and makes an amazing game. I would be happy to play that. Thanks for watching! I hope you enjoyed this video, and I'll see you in the next one.

How Stardew Valley Was Made by Only One Person [4-k6j9g5Hzk]:
Most games are made by development studios that have multiple people working on the same game and AAA titles can even go into hundreds of developers, while small indie teams consist of at least two developers more often than not. However, it's very rare to encounter a bigger sized game where every single part is made by only one person. This is exactly the case with Stardew Valley though, since all the art, music, sound effects, dialogue and programming were done by Eric Barone, also known as Concerned Ape. In 2011 Eric graduated from the University of Washington Tacoma with a computer science degree, so afterwards he applied at a few places, did some interviews, but they never offered him the job. At that point he didn't really know what to do next. Eric has always been into video games, drawing doodles, making music and writing, but he hadn't really considered combining all his hobbies to become an actual game developer. Now that he was looking for a job he decided to give it a shot and develop his first game. Eric figured he could get better at programming this way and improve his chances at scoring a job. Growing up he was encouraged by his father to play around with computers since his father was a technical, logical person himself. His mom on the other hand was more artistic and this gave Eric an insight into both worlds from an early age. In high school Eric kept himself busy playing guitar and even joined a couple of bands while also making music on the computer. After school he would work at a pretzel place where he would stand at a kiosk and draw little sketches. I guess it's all just a lifetime of creating stuff. I've always just enjoyed making things and in the process of doing that I learned a lot of skills. He's a huge fan of the farm simulation RPG series Harvest Moon, so when Eric wanted to make a quick little game to get familiar with game development, he decided to create a Harvest Moon clone. I liked that you could have relationships with the town's folk and even get married and start a family. That was something you couldn't do in most games I played as a kid and it made the experience much more personal. That you were living in a world that felt alive. Time moved forward, with or without your input. According to Eric however, the series became progressively worse after Back to Nature, so he frequently searched for a fan-made or indie Harvest Moon clone, but he never found anything that satisfied him, which compelled Eric to try making one himself. Initially he was planning on releasing his fan-made project, back when it was still called Sprout Valley, on Xbox Live Indie Game since anyone was able to publish a game on that platform. Eric figured he would work on the project for a few months, release it and move on. Perhaps a few Harvest Moon fans would enjoy it and the game would look nice on his resume for future job prospects. However, once he started working on the game and his development skills improved, Eric started seeing more possibilities. He believed it could become a legitimate game and start his career as a real indie developer. Eric didn't have a deliberate plan when working on Stardew Valley and would just follow his intuition when it came to expanding the game. He started with creating the player avatar and next he added a simple area that would later become the player's farm. After that, Eric added the basic farming mechanics. Before he would add things like crops and minerals, he would do proper research on them to accurately match their behaviors and scarcities in the game. He applied this technique to the rest of the game, work on one part until it was about 80% done before he would add depth to it and move on to the next part. In September 2012, Eric, now 24 of age, publicly announced the game on Steam Greenlight to see if people would be interested in the concept behind Stardew Valley. The announcement was accompanied with the first official trailer. Eric had also set up a website to keep people updated on Stardew Valley's progression. As mentioned before, he wanted to develop a Harvest Moon homage at first, but since he decided to expand the scope of the project, Eric saw an opportunity to improve on one of his favorite video game series. The gameplay in Harvest Moon was usually fun, but I felt like no title in the series ever brought it all together in a perfect way. My idea with Stardew Valley was to address the problems I had with Harvest Moon, as well as create more purpose with tried and true gameplay elements such as crafting and quests. In February 2013, a couple of months after the Steam Greenlight announcement, it was revealed that Stardew Valley would be published by Chucklefish, a development studio and publisher that specializes in retro-style games. Eric said that the offer came at just the right time since he didn't want to put the game on Steam Early Access. It seemed like nearly every indie game was doing Early Access at the time. I wanted my game to stand out from the crowd and I knew that many people were growing tired of paying for unfinished products. Furthermore, I felt that Early Access was better suited to very open-ended sandbox games, but was not ideal for a game like Stardew Valley. The team at Chucklefish helped Eric with creating a brand new website, including a new, better forum system. In May 2013, Eric announced that Stardew Valley had been greenlit, so now with the help from a publisher and Steam's approval, nothing was holding Eric back from releasing his passion project once it was ready, yet it would take an additional three years before Stardew Valley would be released on Steam. Eric initially estimated that the game would be done somewhere before 2014, but in November 2013 he created a blog post to let people know that he probably wasn't going to hit that target. He explained that although the game was mostly done, there was still a lot that had to be finished before he was comfortable releasing Stardew Valley. He would rather focus on developing a polished, feature-rich game than a rushed quick release. The following years Eric would frequently blog about Stardew Valley's progression, which kept people's interest in the game and also allowed fans to provide feedback. While developing Stardew Valley was definitely Eric's main focus, he still needed a way to earn some money to pay the bills. Therefore, he worked part-time as an usher at Seattle's Paramount Theater. Fortunately, he was able to live together with his girlfriend Amber, who was a planned biology graduate student. A perfect situation for someone who's developing a farming simulator. During its entire development, the game went through quite a lot of changes. Eric's game development skills would greatly improve over time, which is why he decided to redo some parts of the game several times over. The character art especially took some time before he was happy with it. I put in thousands of hours on pixel art just to get better at it and better at it. I just persevered and forced myself to learn. You realize the thing that you thought was good actually isn't, you realize why and you improve on it. And that's just an endless cycle. All the artwork was done in Paint.net, a free raster graphics editor program for Microsoft Windows, and all the programming was done in C-Sharp using the Microsoft XNA framework. Eric used the audio software called Reason by Reason Studios, formerly known as Propellerhead Software, to produce all the game's music and sound effects. Eric was very excited that he was able to work on Stardew Valley as a solo developer. He enjoyed the total freedom to implement whatever idea came to his mind and enabled him to bring a cohesive vision to life. He also didn't mind that he had to cover all the development aspects himself. I also enjoy all the aspects of making a game. Coding, drawing, making music and writing. I would get bored doing just one thing all the time. It was very important to Eric that Stardew Valley was as open and accessible as possible to a variety of players. If you want to raise 300 rabbits, you can. If you want to invest in a huge field of crops with automated sprinkler systems, you can do that too. The gameplay is flexible and open. Another improvement over the Harvest Moon series that Eric wanted to include was an endless stream of end-game content. He said that most Harvest Moon games end after two in-game years of farming, so he designed Stardew Valley in a way so that people can enjoy the game for as long as they want, even after many in-game years. Besides making the game as open as possible, Eric also aimed for a certain feel that he wanted the game to represent. A feel that was intrinsically tied to his own values in real life and those were sometimes more important to him than expanding gameplay mechanics. For instance, at one point during development, butchering animals was part of the gameplay. Stardew Valley allows you to raise farm animals that produce useful products for the player, like eggs, milk and so on, but some beta testers requested the option to butcher the animals and collect their meat. Eric initially added the feature but he eventually removed it again since it didn't feel right to him. I didn't want to have that sort of violence. You give the animals names, pet them, and a little heart goes above their head and stuff and then you butcher them. It just felt wrong. It didn't jibe with the feeling I was going for with the game, so I cut that and I don't regret it. While creating the world for Stardew Valley, Eric, an Auburn native, took some inspiration from the area he grew up in. Therefore, many items in the game are local to the Pacific Northwest, like Salmonberries, Ferns and Chanterelles. I've lived in the Pacific Northwest my whole life, so the feeling of this nature is deeply ingrained in me. Eric has said that he wants the game to be fun, but to also have real world messages. The story, for example, clearly illustrates the fight against capitalism and the importance of local communities. This is further emphasized by Stardew Valley's many villagers that all have their unique identity, and throughout the course of the game they all go about their daily schedules. Furthermore, the player is encouraged to interact with them by giving the villagers gifts so they can unlock more of their storylines. While for the most part the game has a general fun, uplifting theme, the villagers' individual storylines can get dark sometimes. People struggle with personal issues and I wanted to portray that. I think it makes the characters a lot more relatable, not just these ideal abstractions of people that are sometimes found in games. Eric wrote and rewrote hundreds of lines of dialogue for all the villagers which would take him several months of work. The villagers also have their own individual cutscenes, which required extensive work and testing as well. Eric also considered what type of game he wanted Stardew Valley to be. He wanted to go in a more zen, slower paced direction since he's not a fan of games that encourage more clicking than anything else. That's the reason why the cooking mechanic, for example, is meant to heal more of your energy than regular uncooked products, as opposed to selling the cooked food for more gold. Eric wanted to avoid players feeling like they had to turn every ingredient into cooking to maximize their profits, which would just end up in the player clicking more buttons. According to Eric, a game like Stardew Valley is a lot more personal than a game made by a hundred people that's some kind of focus tested experience where they just want to make as much profit as possible. However, Eric kept his real life identity a secret for years and instead used his nickname Concerned Ape whenever he communicated about Stardew Valley's progress on his blog. He later said in an interview that he's an introvert and likes to keep to himself. His hermit lifestyle and his immense dedication to Stardew Valley would eventually put strain on his relationship with Amber, who would often remind Eric to eat and relax by watching Star Trek together. His busy schedule allowed little room for anything else in his life. When I'm deep into a project that's consuming my entire life, that's what makes me feel the best. Not once during development did Eric ask anyone for help, not even on online forums. He taught everything he needed to know himself since he hates asking people for help. He's proud of that achievement and didn't want to have a subconscious feeling of owing someone else credit for a specific part of the game. The huge responsibility of making a game all by yourself would take its toll sometimes, Eric admitted. There were times during development that I didn't feel like working, that I even wanted to quit entirely. However, he never gave up and kept pushing to make his dream a reality. It was both passion and discipline that kept Eric going and he said it's a lot easier to stay driven when you're doing your own project, knowing that there are no limits to how far you can go. When Eric didn't feel like working he would just browse Reddit and procrastinate, but once he had an idea that he was really passionate about, Eric would work like crazy. He explained that during those moments he wanted to see that idea come to life as quickly as possible when it was still fresh in his mind. In April 2015 Eric addressed the game's release date since people were very eager to get their hands on it. I've been working on Stardew Valley for years and I want it to be released as much as anyone. However, I'm not willing to do that until the game is not only complete, but also in a state I'm happy with. It simply could not be released in its current form. It's not a finished game yet. It's tantalizingly close to being a finished game, but it's also a huge project and I'm just one guy. In November 2015 he addressed the release date once again, saying he had spent a month of October trying to finish the single player part. However, he also spoke about the multiplayer portion of the game and how there's still work to be done on that front. People had suggested to release the single player version first and patch in the multiplayer later, but Eric mentioned that other developers had advised him to wait with the release until the game was completely finished. A month later however, Eric had changed his mind and addressed this in a new blog post, saying it felt wrong to him to postpone the release when the single player portion was already fully completed. It's always been important to him to get the game in the hands of the community as soon as possible. The months leading up to the game's release would prove to be Eric's biggest challenge yet and he almost gave up on the game entirely. Imagine playing the same game every day for four and a half years. All day. I was just absolutely sick of it. I was bored. I didn't even have an objective sense of if the game was good or not. In fact, I thought it was bad. No one else was playing and testing Stardew Valley besides Eric and although his girlfriend would try out new builds of the game from time to time, she couldn't give detailed feedback due to her lack of video game knowledge. Therefore, Eric was never really sure if the game was actually any fun to play or not and this pressure would build up more and more in the final weeks of development. I had to prove that I wasn't just crazy, that this wasn't just a pipe dream and that I was actually gonna follow through on it. That was really getting to me psychologically, thinking about whether I was wasting my life, wasting my time. Luckily, his confidence in the game came back when he decided to let other people playtest his game. A mutual contact at Chucklefish had introduced Eric to three Twitch streamers and he contacted them to play Stardew Valley. They helped Eric look for bugs and gave detailed feedback to further improve the game. Unfortunately, the day before release disaster struck. Eric found a game-breaking bug and with only a few hours until the game's release he needed to fix it fast. I stayed up very late in a panic to fix it. I was in a sort of daze the whole time. It was very stressful, but also exhilarating. The single player version of the game was finally ready for release on February 26th, 2016. It first launched on Steam and was later ported to macOS, Linux, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation Vita, iOS and Android. In 2019 the game was even added to Tesla Arcade, a video game service that's implemented in every Tesla car. Stardew Valley was very well received by both critics and gamers and scored an 89 on Metacritic, with many reviewers saying that the forming RPG provides a rich and seemingly endless gaming experience. As of January 2020, Stardew Valley has sold over 10 million copies across all available platforms, another testament to its overwhelming success. Eric was also named one of the top 10 developers of 2016 by Gamasutra. He ended up single-handedly developing something that breathed new life into a genre that had mostly been dominated by Harvest Moon since the 90's. Furthermore, Forbes also named Eric one of their 30 under 30 in the games industry. Development didn't slow down after its release and if anything, it made Eric work even harder. He said that during the four years leading up to Stardew Valley's release, he would work 10 hours a day, 7 days a week, on average. After the release, his average workday would increase to 15 hours a day. The first few weeks were especially busy for Eric since he was fixing bugs and releasing patches as fast as he possibly could, since it would affect Eric greatly when someone online was having problems with the game. After the first major update for Stardew Valley, Eric finally felt the need for some time off, so in August of 2017 he went on a vacation with his girlfriend and some friends. They all went on a road trip where they visited many national parks and even the Grand Canyon. Over the years, Stardew Valley generated a very welcoming and friendly community and despite Eric being an introvert, he would respond as much as possible to fans to either troubleshoot problems with the game or just to answer questions. He would treat everyone with respect and be as honest and straightforward as possible. When asked why Stardew Valley became such a huge success, Eric said that it maybe had something to do with indie games in general. He further explained that the special thing about indie is that it's kind of a personal connection between the creator and the audience. Eric noted that it's kind of rare that a game with the scope of Stardew Valley is made entirely by one person, which makes it even more personal and he thinks that's what people are looking for in an indie game. It's not some faceless corporation that is giving you a focus-tested message or a focus-tested experience, it's this raw connection between the creator and the audience. I think maybe people are ready for that sort of thing. After releasing Stardew Valley, Eric got the opportunity to meet the father of the Harvest Moon series, Yasuhiro Wada, during an interview, which was a huge honor for Eric and a dream come true. He even left the interview with a signed copy of his old Harvest Moon SNES copy. Wada spoke very highly of Stardew Valley saying it carries on the legacy of the original Harvest Moon because of the freedom you're given. Looking back, Eric isn't exactly sure how he pulled it off to make a huge game like Stardew Valley all on his own. I'm not sure if there was any technique to it or if it was just a quirk of my brain chemistry. I did always have a ridiculous amount of faith in myself and in the game, and yet I knew that I was still a nobody and the only way I could change that was to work super hard. It does help if you can absolutely convince yourself that you're destined for greatness. It's not even an ego thing, it's just a way to prevent doubt and insecurity from hindering you. The four-player co-op multiplayer portion was released on August 1st, 2018 for all PC platforms thanks to the help of Chucklefish, who took care of the technical aspects relating to the online multiplayer. This way Eric was free to focus on creating more content for Stardew Valley, which was added to the game as free updates, and included things like new farm types, new house upgrades, new crops, new buildings, new relationship options, new quests and so on. With a new update on the horizon, it seems like Eric is still far from done with Stardew Valley. However, he said he's already got ideas for future games that he'd like to explore after he's done with Stardew Valley. Luckily for fans, Eric is open to the idea of letting those future games take place in the same universe as his farming simulator. Whatever the case may be, Eric Barone has a bright future ahead of him as an indie developer.

How Celeste Was Made and Inspired by Real-Life Rock Climbing [MSKOQr_YS-U]:
The development story of Celeste is very much intertwined with one of the developer's own personal experience with anxiety and depression, but before that, it started out as a fun little project between two friends. In August 2015, game developers Matty Thorson and Noel Berry decided to do a game jam project where they had to develop a game in four days. Matty and I wanted to create a short game in PICO-8 over a weekend. We wanted our concept to be fairly minimalist, partially due to the time constraints we set on ourselves and the limitations of the tool, but that also had a lot of depth in mechanics. The idea of a character struggling to climb a mountain felt like it fit really well with this. Matty took care of the audio and game design, while Noel was responsible for the art and coding the game. Since it was developed for the PICO-8 fantasy console, the two friends immediately made it available for anyone on the internet to try out and play it. They later renamed the PICO-8 game to Celeste Classic. While it was positively received, especially among speedrunners, Celeste Classic lacked much of the story and atmosphere of the fully realized version that would be released three years later. This was mostly because of the limitations of the PICO-8 console, which is why the two developers had to limit Celeste Classic to 16 colors and 30 levels. Furthermore, Matty and Noel just wanted to make a fun and hard platformer about climbing a mountain, nothing more. However, in January 2016, they decided to expand the PICO-8 game because the developers had grown fond of the protagonist and they saw the potential of the general idea. Their goal was to still keep the project relatively small and finish it in about two to three months. Matty took on the role of director, designer, writer and gameplay coder and Noel was once again responsible for most of the coding. The moment both friends started brainstorming on how to expand Celeste Classic, the ideas came flowing in. After a couple of months of development, they felt it was time to ask some colleagues for help to give the game the production quality it deserves. Artists Umura Betani and Pedro Medeiros, who both had worked with Matty and Noel before, were brought on board to provide the artwork. Matty had worked with them on Towerfall and Noel had a project of his own called Skytorn, which Umura and Pedro were producing the art for. Unfortunately, Skytorn was eventually cancelled. Around the same time, the developers reached out to Lena Raine since they really liked her work on Soundcloud. Shortly after, she joined the team and started composing the soundtrack for Celeste. With the addition of these three talented artists, the game was making good progress. However, the team wasn't yet complete, since they still needed someone to help with the sound design. Luckily, Power Up Audio, the studio of sound engineers that also worked on Towerfall and Skytorn, agreed to team up once again for Celeste. Power Up Audio used FMOD Studio to create and manage all the sound effects in the game. Asprite was used to create all the pixel art and in-game animations and all the high-res and concept art was made with Clip Studio Paint, previously better known as Manga Studio. The 3D model of the mountain on the map select screen was made by Gabi D'Arienzo and she used Blender to produce the 3D graphics. The lighting used in that 3D model was done by Sven Bergstrom. All the game's code was done in C-Sharp and the studio used the Microsoft XNA framework to develop Celeste. A custom level editor, called Ocmo Editor, was created to produce all the levels and was made publicly available for any developer to download and use. When the individual levels were finished, they were stitched together with a custom map designer tool. The base game of Celeste consists of eight chapters and Maddy et al described the first chapter as the more expanded game of the Pico 8 version that they wanted to develop in a couple of months and release. Once they were deep into development though, they felt there was a lot more they could do with the world and characters, so the decision was made to go all out and turn Celeste into something bigger. One of the studio's main goals was to make sure that when someone starts playing Celeste, it's immediately fun. It took a lot of iteration to get to that point and playtesting was a crucial part of that process. Maddy and Noel, being roommates throughout Celeste's entire development, would invite friends over and watch them play for hours at a time. Whenever one of their friends would point something out that didn't feel as good, the developers would make changes on the spot to get immediate feedback, until their friends were flowing as best as they could. Noel mentioned that the good thing about developing a platformer is that you can quickly hand a build to someone and ask them how it feels to play, since you only need a few levels to get a sense of the way the game feels and flows. For him and Maddy, it was important to visually see how people reacted to the game during playtests and see how they were emotionally handling it. Lastly, Noel said that they focused on making the game tough but fair. We also had a general philosophy that, though we want a game to feel hard, we always want it to feel fair. The game works in the player's favor, wherever possible, and when it felt like a level or mechanic was hard in the wrong way, it was cut or modified. Maddy describes Celeste as a fractal story, a story made up of smaller stories. At the game level, Celeste is about a girl who's running away from her personal problems and decides to climb a mountain, which forces Madeline to confront those problems. Like most platformers, Celeste is split up into areas and each area is a smaller story within the main story that has its own arc and pacing. The team wanted each area to feel distinct and unique, with their own aesthetic and mechanical themes. Maddy also said that the areas are a lot like Metroid maps in that all the rooms are connected and seamless. There are branching paths and even secret branching paths. Every area is then further divided into levels and the director describes each level as a really small quick story. Visualizing each level this way helped the team to anchor all their design decisions. In practice, they were constantly zooming in and out of these three perspectives to re-evaluate their work. When players think back to a certain level, the developers want them to remember a story, rather than an annoying jump at the start of the level. The team was always looking for ways to offload their narrative onto their level design, in the hopes that the experience of the player matches the emotional experience of the protagonist. Just like the PICO-8 version, Celeste at its core is about climbing a mountain, so it's no surprise that the moment-to-moment gameplay is influenced by real-life rock climbing. One dimension of rock climbing that I love is the idea of multiple approaches. Because rock climbing uses your body, and everyone's body is different, routes in rock climbing are usually designed loosely enough that they can be solved in a lot of different ways. The three main moves, jumping, dashing and climbing, all give the player vertical progress, but they use different resources and have different nuances and trade-offs. Therefore, the player is able to approach the platforming in different ways. At the start of development, Maddy didn't realize yet the importance of multiple approaches, so the developer would design levels with a specific solution in mind. However, playtesters would always try to do something different to complete the level. This caused Maddy to rethink the level design and figure out all the ways people would try to complete levels so that they could enable them as well as possible for players. This wasn't an easy task, since the developers had a difficult time finding a balance between offering multiple solutions to every level without making the game too easy. It goes without saying that every level went through multiple iterations, but Maddy underlines that the story of the level was never adjusted. If the story wasn't working, they would either scrap the entire level or turn the story into something completely else. Although there's always an intended story and pathway for each level that's approachable in multiple ways, Maddy revealed that it is possible to skip the intended route and beat the levels in a much faster but much more difficult way. The director said that this was completely intentional and the team sees it as a second story to the levels that's intended for speedrunners that have a much better understanding of the game after multiple playthroughs. As far as multiple approaches in rock climbing goes, this is like when you go to the rock gym and there's that one person that's super ripped and doing all the routes with just their arms. If someone wants to put the effort to get that good at our game, we want to reward them for it. They did make sure that the much faster way was never mistaken for the intended path, since this would otherwise frustrate newcomers to the game. One of the biggest struggles during development was making sure that the levels and areas matched up. Maddy described it as a slow and painstakingly job, since they never got anything right on the first try, so the levels and areas had to be adapted over and over again. This also meant that a lot of work had to be discarded, because a lot of the levels that Maddy would sketch out wouldn't fit the mood of the area. On top of that, the team had lots of inspiration for harder levels with fun mechanical ideas but they didn't fit into the main story. That's why a hard mode was added to the game, where the team was able to fully explore the design space without having to worry about the story. The team has said that games like Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong Country 2, Metroid, Kiro Blaster and many others were a huge inspiration for the gameplay and level design. The studio didn't want to develop Celeste with a no-player-gets-left-behind mentality, since it's supposed to be a difficult challenge for both the player and the protagonist, but Maddy did take extra care that the first area was as accessible as possible for anyone that played it. When the team was already late in development, they decided to further accommodate less skillful players by adding an assist mode. This happened after a big internal discussion and they agreed that they wanted as many players as possible to be able to enjoy the story without the difficulty potentially holding them back. The assist mode provides many different options to tweak the difficulty level and this was done to not be condescending to players that prefer an easier experience. Maddy confirmed that the game takes place near Vancouver, where the developer lives, although the mountain is completely fictional. However, the title Celeste is inspired by a real mountain, called Celeste Mountain, and the team discovered this fact when they were googling cool names for mountains when they were working on Celeste Classic. To honor Celeste's humble beginnings, the team ported the original Pico 8 game into the 2D platformer as an easter egg. While the gameplay is inspired by rock climbing, the story of Celeste is very much a reflection of Maddy's personal experience with anxiety and depression. I overwork myself when I'm anxious. Our work is a great creative outlet, but it stops being cathartic and starts being avoidant when I push myself to those extremes. It took me a while to realize that crunch can be a form of self-harm. Maddy further described the experience as painful, yet the developer wanted to explore these feelings of anxiety in Celeste. Although Maddy's mental illness informed the story, the director also said that Steven Universe was a big inspiration and that the show actually taught Maddy how to write a better story. When Maddy decided they wanted to implement their personal experience with mental illness in Celeste, the story finally started falling into place. According to Noel, this happened around the time they were working on Chapter 3 and they actually went back and redid some of the dialogue in previous chapters to fit Maddy's new vision for the story. This change also impacted one of the game mechanics that the team was experimenting with. Originally, the dark side of Madeline was more of a gameplay mechanic, but with the new story in place, it made much more sense to turn her into her own proper character. This darker side of the protagonist, also dubbed Badeline by the fanbase, became the physical manifestation that represents Madeline's own feelings of depression. Throughout Celeste's development, Maddy realized it was okay to feel the way they were feeling and that failure isn't necessarily a bad thing. This frame of mind made its way into Celeste by reminding the player from time to time that it's alright to fail. If you're making a game about anxiety and depression, it felt like to us that we needed to show the same kindness to the player that we want to show ourselves. Maddy and the team did make it clear that they didn't set out to make a game to help combat depression, but rather to tell a story born from personal experiences. Our top priorities were to tell a story that meant something to us and explore these topics from an individual perspective, to draw players into this world with these characters we grew to love. Our intention going in wasn't to represent mental illness in general or to make a how to deal with depression guide, and we didn't think to consult professionals on the topic. Although the studio didn't consult with any experts, they made sure not to minimize the very serious issues mental illness can cause. It was a very iterative process and all the dialogue in the game went through multiple rounds of rewrites as our understanding evolved. Mr. Oshiro's scenes in the hotel in particular changed quite a bit as we discovered his place in the story. Making sure we didn't trivialize the problems our characters were grappling with was a big concern for us. As mentioned before, the narrative fell in place when Maddy knew they wanted to tell a story about anxiety and depression, but for a long time the developer didn't know how to end the story. I didn't know how it would end because I was still dealing with this stuff while we were making it. One of the things I realized while we were working on it is that I want to fix my work-life balance. It was kinda tough realizing that and then being like, welp, have to finish this game now. Fortunately, throughout Celeste's development, Maddy started to come to terms with their depression and gained a better understanding of it. This helped the director fill in the details of the way Madeline deals with her own depression in the game. Without spoiling too much of the story, the studio wanted to communicate that there's no simple solution for what Madeline goes through in the game and that the conflict within her isn't magically solved when the credits start rolling. The game was first publicly announced in July 2016 and the team even streamed some of Celeste's development on Twitch to give people a first look at their new project. A few months later, in September 2016, the platformer was first publicly playable at PAX West at the Indie Megabooth. Back then, the developers were planning on releasing Celeste in 2017 and were even hoping to release Celeste during the launch window of the Nintendo Switch. Unfortunately, the studio had to delay the release to January 2018 so that they could realize the full vision they had for Celeste. But game development has a reputation of being notoriously hard to schedule, for good reason. I can't speak for everyone, but for us, game development is largely a process of discovery. Back at the start of 2017, we thought Celeste would span around 200 to 300 levels, stitched together by a minimalistic narrative. Today, we have over 500 levels and it looks like we'll crest 600 pretty soon. Celeste's narrative has grown to an essential feature of the experience and maybe the aspect of the game I'm most personally proud of, because we pushed ourselves so hard on it. It deserves room to breathe and become everything it can be and fortunately we can afford to give it that space. We need to know that we took it as far as we could." Celeste was officially released on January 25th, 2018 on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, Linux and macOS. The game was universally praised by critics, complimenting pretty much every aspect of the indie platformer and it received multiple perfect scores as a result. When players got their hands on it, many of them felt a personal connection to the story and its characters. In some cases, it even helped them with their own personal struggles. The composer, Lena Raine, shared something that a fan had said to her. One of them mentioned that they are suicidal, but chose to live as a result of the encouragement given by the game. I legitimately don't think I've ever felt as much validation that what I'm doing with my life can help people. Besides the story and gameplay, the soundtrack was also highly praised around the world and was officially released by record label Materia Collective. Additionally, an official piano sheet music book and piano album was later released on January 25th, 2019. Lena was given free reign over the soundtrack and suffice to say, the studio was thrilled with what she came up with and further said that her strong vision really clicked with the story. In many cases, the soundtrack also informed the direction of the level design and the When the time came for award season in 2018, Celeste, despite being an indie game, certainly wasn't left behind and was nominated for dozens of awards, even as game of the year. It went on to win a bunch of those awards and the team was completely overwhelmed and honored by all the attention the game had received throughout the year. That change came from inside of you and you're capable of a lot more, thank you. The game's critical success also translated into financial success, selling over 500,000 copies by the end of 2018. On January 1st, 2019, the game received a limited collector's edition and later in September, Celeste received a substantial free update that added a new chapter titled Farewell, which added a hundred new levels as well as 40 minutes of new music. Around the same time, the developers made the decision to form a brand new studio. I'm retiring Mad Makes Games Incorporated, for the most part. Mad Makes Games will still be listed as a publisher or developer for Towerfall and Celeste, depending on the platform, but all our future work will come from Extremely OK Games. I started Mad Makes Games when I was working solo in my parents' basement and I never thought I'd be working with such an amazing team on games of this scale. By September, Celeste had sold almost an additional 500,000 copies, putting the studio in a more comfortable position for its next project. I don't have an exact up-to-date number, but I know we're coming up on a million copies soon, which is unbelievable to us. It's really given us space to create on our own terms for the near future. It's crazy that we don't have to charge money for Chapter 9, for example. And it's amazing that we have the time and resources to form our new studio and get everyone working together in one office. That'll make our next project go a lot smoother. That next project that Maddy referenced is yet to be revealed, but we know for certain it won't be a sequel to Celeste. While this may be a disappointment to some, the studio is excited for the future and determined to make more memorable gaming experiences. We really don't want to make a sequel to Celeste. Maybe in the future we'll change our minds, but right now, we don't know how we'd do a sequel justice. And besides, we're way more interested in making something new for our next full release.

How The Binding of Isaac Was Made and Designed to Fail [FT3m8fGLrKQ]:
The Binding of Isaac was never supposed to become an immense success and yet it's now Edmund McMillan's biggest game to date. It makes no sense to the indie developer, especially because he designed it to go against mainstream games at the time. "'From any mainstream marketing perspective, I designed Isaac to fail and that was my goal from the start. Not that he didn't believe in the project, rather he didn't expect so many people to connect with his weird roguelike shoot-em-up that draws from religion to serve its story and theme. The Binding of Isaac began as a little side project, after Edmund was done with his previous critically acclaimed indie game, Super Meat Boy. Thanks to that platformer's success, Edmund didn't have to worry about making his next project another hit, since he was all set financially. Furthermore, he wanted to go back to his roots and prove to himself he could still make some really weird stuff like his earlier games Host, Aether and Coil for example. In other words, he wanted to develop something without creative and artistic boundaries and without worrying about making a profit. When Edmund's co-developer and personal friend Tommy Refenes was taking a well-deserved vacation, Edmund decided to start a week-long game jam as a way to relax and get the creative juices flowing for Team Meat's next game. Since Tommy was on vacation, he asked Florian Himsel to join his game jam. Florian is a programmer who worked on some of Edmund's previous games and was up for anything that Edmund felt like making. So while Florian handled all the programming, Edmund was responsible for all the art, design and story. From the very start, Edmund had two very clear goals. One, create a roguelike using the Legend of Zelda dungeon structure and two, make a game about his relationship with religion. It was a challenging assignment, but very fun to design according to Edmund. After seven days, the two developers created something that started to look like a game and they were too happy with the prototype to end development. So what was meant to be just a fun exercise, quickly ballooned into something bigger. They continued to work on it in Flash, using ActionScript 2 and during this time, the pair never even considered if it could become a commercially viable game. They just wanted to finish it. Edmund explained he wanted to make a seemingly endless experience, so he quickly landed on the roguelike sub-genre. He also wanted to combine that formula with some kind of real-time experience, like Spelunky. Furthermore, the developer also drew inspiration from more traditional role-playing game aspects of roguelike games like Crawl and Diablo, while the core gameplay is inspired by shoot-em-ups like Smash TV. These elements combined with the Legend of Zelda dungeon structure resulted in quite an impressive real-time dungeon crawler format. Edmund even said that almost every aspect of the game seemed to fall perfectly into place with little effort. Besides the actual dungeons from The Legend of Zelda, the Isaac creator also decided to incorporate some aspects from Zelda's progression system. Each dungeon in Zelda rewards the player with an item and a heart container to make Link stronger and provide a sense of progression. In The Binding of Isaac, Edmund chose to place at least one item in every level, as well as rewarding the player with one stat-raising item by beating the boss. While the items are random, they're designed in a way so that each one alters the character's physical appearance and therefore always gives the player a sense of growth and progression. Fun fact, four of the original playable characters were based on the main classes of Dungeons and Dragons – Thief, Cleric, Wizard and Fighter. While many elements were inspired by other games, Edmund wanted Isaac to stand out from other roguelike games by shaking up the way the difficulty works. Instead of using the traditional difficulty settings, he made it so the game adjusts to the players as they played, increasing the difficulty as they progressed. The developer felt this made Isaac feel longer, richer and gave it the appearance of a story that writes itself. It also allowed the game to reward players for playing well by providing them with more items, playable characters and other unlockable content that would help aid in their adventures and keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. Edmund describes the progression system as quote-unquote magic. With Isaac, my goal was to create magic. I wanted players to feel like the game was endless and alive, that the game had a mind of its own and was writing itself as they played. I remembered the original Zelda having this feeling of magic and mystery. You weren't sure what things did until you experimented with them, and you had to brainstorm with your friends and put all your findings together in order to progress. I felt like since I was referencing Zelda so much in Isaac's core design, I should also complement it with the feeling of mystery I felt I had back in the day. Now that one of his two main goals was taken care of, it was time to tackle the other one, his relationship with religion. When Edmund was designing the game's overall story and theme, he wanted to express his feelings about religion in a way he was comfortable with, namely with dark humor and satire. If you've played Isaac, you might have noticed that it touches on some extremely mature themes like child abuse, gender identity, infanticide, neglect, suicide, abortion and how religion might negatively affect the child. It's the kind of topics most games would avoid and this further motivated Edmund to incorporate them in Isaac. He strongly believes that people want what they haven't seen yet. I'm not saying everyone who played Isaac did so because they cared about these themes or that they even understood why they were in the game, but I strongly believe that this adult conversation I dove into with Isaac is what made the game stand out to people and kept them thinking. Edmund grew up in a religious family, with his mom's side being Catholic and his dad's side being born-again Christians. The Catholic side of his family practiced rituals to keep the family safe and also lit candles to keep loved ones out of purgatory. The developers said they would drink and eat the body and blood of their savior to be abolished of mortal sin. He even describes some of the rituals as casting spells. As a child, he loved that part of religion and thought it was very creative. He even attributes lots of the inspiration for his previous games to his Catholic upbringing. Unfortunately, dealing with the religious aspects of his other side of the family was a much more difficult time when he was growing up. Activities such as Dungeons and Dragons and Magic the Gathering were considered evil and Edmund was told many times he would go to hell for playing those kinds of games and generally condemned him for his sins. Eventually, they even took away his Magic the Gathering cards, which was quite devastating to him as a kid, since it was one of his most favorite hobbies. These negative experiences sadly gave the young Edmund feelings of self-hate and isolation, but at the same time it shaped and fueled his dark creativity that spawned many of his game ideas. He wouldn't be the same game designer he is today without both the good and the bad encounters with religion. It's exactly this duality that the developer decided to fuse with Isaac's story and theme. Furthermore, Edmund mentioned that he thinks the Bible is a very good, creatively written book and one of his favorite aspects of it is how so many people can find different meanings in one passage. This inspired him to apply that aspect to The Binding of Isaac's story as well, which is why the game's endings have many possible interpretations. The overall story and plot of the game is also heavily inspired by a story in the Bible called The Binding of Isaac, where God asks Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac to prove his devotion to him. Besides the Bible and his religious upbringing, Edmund's obsession with Christian propaganda films of the 80s also had a big influence on the look and feel of Isaac. A lot of these propaganda videos revolved around fictional satanic cults that ritualistically abused and sacrificed children to gain demonic powers. Danny Baranowski, the composer of Super Meat Boy, came back to work on Isaac and was involved pretty much as soon as Edmund started thinking about the concept out loud. He was out of town when development on the first prototype started, but began working on the soundtrack as soon as he was back. It was a very symbiotic process according to Danny, where Edmund would send some art or builds of the game which Danny used as reference for creating the tracks. Then Danny would send his work back and then Edmund would draw more art and iterate on the game based on the music. The two developers finished the first fully playable version of Isaac after about three months of part-time development and launched the indie title in September 2011. The devs had some reservations about releasing the game because it was quite unpolished, but after seeing the positive reaction from friends, they decided to launch it on Steam. The Valve-owned platform was chosen for a couple of reasons. Steam allows developers to sell uncensored and unrated games and this was vital for Edmund because he wasn't going to try and get an ESRB rating if he wasn't sure it was going to sell more than a hundred copies. The developer also said that Valve knew the game was weird and could possibly get some backlash, but they allowed it on Steam anyway because they felt it had potential. Lastly, the ability to quickly update games to fix bugs or even add completely new content was another huge plus for the two-person team. This last feature would prove very useful the first couple of weeks after launch, since there were many bugs to iron out. It was updated every single day for two weeks straight and with every update, the two devs would discover more bugs. Luckily, the most severe game-breaking bugs were eliminated in the first two days. Edmund felt very bad launching the game in such a broken state, especially after seeing so many upset players posting about their issues online. The number one question people asked was, why didn't you test the game? The reason we released Isaac when we did was because it was done, if untested, and I didn't want to waste any more of my time on something I expected would crash and burn. I was just so worried it would suck that I wanted to get it out and over with. Edmund further explained that it would have been near impossible to launch Isaac without any bugs whatsoever, because the game is based on complex variables that multiply with each level you pass. In order to fully test all the possible outcomes, it would have taken hundreds of testers several days of extensive playtime to fully debug the indie title. This sadly meant the day one buyers bore the responsibility of testing the game and uncovering all the bugs. To make up for a less than desirable release, a free mini-expansion was added to the game, but that expansion was also riddled with bugs. Aside from all those problems, the roguelike was also struggling with performance and this mostly came down to the Flash engine. Even back in 2011, Flash and Action Script 2 were already quite outdated, so this caused Isaac to run poorly on lower-end PCs and even machines with amazing specs, since Flash doesn't play well with dual-core processors. To make matters even worse, the engine also lacked controller support and integrated Steam features, causing Tommy to step in and help write an achievement program specifically for Isaac so it could award Steam achievements to players. One last problem that was tied to the engine was the game's scope. Late in development, Edmund and Florian realized that Flash simply wasn't made to support a game of Isaac's size. Once the Flash file rose above 300MB, it became really difficult to generate an SWF file without causing a crash. Suffice to say, if Edmund had known that anyone would have cared about his side project, he wouldn't have made it in Flash at all. Despite all of its problems however, more people than expected were buying and playing the game. The first few weeks it was selling about 100 to 200 copies a day and eventually stabilized at about 150 copies a day after a few months. This already far exceeded the team's expectations, but five months after release, Edmund noticed daily sales were starting to climb up. It's very rare to see an upswing in sales that long after release without anything like a sale triggering it. 200 copies per day turned into 500 copies, then 1000 copies and by the seven month mark, Isaac was averaging sales of more than 1500 copies a day and climbing. It left the two developers clueless as to why it was happening, until Edmund decided to check out YouTube to discover that fans of Isaac were constantly uploading Let's Play videos that received lots of traffic. Against all expectations, the biblically inspired indie game had found its fanbase, a very vocal fanbase to boot, drawing in thousands of new players every day. Edmund's best guess as to why so many people liked it was that he made it from the standpoint of a creative outcast. The one person that is supposed to care about Isaac tries to condemn him for his creativity, so his only real escape is his imagination. It's not a story you see in video games all that much, said the developer, but it's a story a lot of people can probably relate to. In January 2012, more than 450,000 copies were sold and Isaac's growing popularity attracted the attention of a publisher that wanted to bring the title to the 3DS. Unfortunately, in February 2012, Edmund tweeted that Nintendo had rejected the game because of questionable religious content. This decision caused quite a stir in the gaming community, spawning many articles and opinion pieces about who gets to decide what blasphemy or questionable religious content is. Edmund himself was surprised to hear about the rejection, because people working at Nintendo were telling him for a while that they were confident it would be approved for the handheld console. The Nintendo employee said that the only thing that could potentially hold it back was its religious content. The premise of a mother trying to kill her son because God told her to, was apparently a bit too much for Nintendo's family-friendly image after all. During the approval process, Edmund was even asked if he'd be willing to make some changes to the content in order to get on Nintendo's eShop. The developer never received a list, which could potentially point to the fact that the problem was the game's entire theme and story, something that's not easily changed without losing its original spirit. Isaac eventually found its way to Nintendo consoles after all, which I'll talk about more later. The indie title was never meant to get any kind of DLC, since it was supposed to fail in the first place. However, Edmund did have a few pages of dream ideas he originally wanted to add to the game. Now that fans were clamoring for more content, the team got back to work and decided to turn all those dream ideas into an extra large DLC expansion. All the positive fan reception certainly motivated them to continue Isaac's adventure, but the number one reason why Edmund wanted to make more content was because of its wife Danielle. It was the first game I had designed that she became obsessed with and it made me extremely happy to see her fall in love with something I had made. I just had to continue it. Wrath of the Lamb was released in May 2012 and added over 80% more content, like new bosses, new items, new endings, new floors and much much more. The expansion was well received and by November 2012, Isaac had sold 1 million copies on PC and Mac and 25% of players also bought Wrath of the Lamb. Earlier in 2012, Edmund was contacted by Tyrone Rodriguez, the founder of game developer and publishing company Nicalis. He asked the developer how he felt about porting the roguelike to consoles. Now, while Edmund has nothing but love for consoles, the stress of releasing Super Meat Boy on multiple platforms still haunted him at the time. Therefore, the Isaac creator had a couple of conditions before saying yes to Tyrone. First and foremost, it wouldn't be a simple port, but rather a complete remake that would include a big second expansion. This meant ditching Flash and recreating the game from scratch in a custom engine written in C++. Edmund also wanted it to feature brand new 16-bit pixel art sprites to better resemble one of its inspirations, namely The Legend of Zelda. Additionally, he also wanted to explore adding local co-op to the experience. Finally, Nicalis would have to deal with all the business aspects related to the console versions. The company agreed with the terms and development on The Binding of Isaac Rebirth started shortly afterwards. Despite Nintendo not approving the original version, both Edmund and Tyrone originally envisioned Rebirth as a Nintendo exclusive solely because it seemed like the perfect partnership for a game that's so heavily inspired by the NES-era Legend of Zelda games. The remake was released in November 2014 for PC, Mac, Linux, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. It introduced a ton of fresh content like new playable characters, items, enemies, bosses, challenges, room layout seeds for floors and much more. In July 2015, the remake arrived on Wii U, Xbox One and new Nintendo 3DS. Yes, the devs and Tyrone were finally able to convince Nintendo to release the indie roguelike on their handheld system, and they couldn't have done it without the much needed help from three higher-ups working at the Japanese company. Steve Singer, Vice President of Licensing, Mark Griffin, Senior Manager in Licensing and Game Development, and Dan Edelman, Head of Indie Development, were all big fans of The Binding of Isaac and continued to push for its release from within Nintendo. According to Tyrone, Nintendo actually never really said no to the game in the past, but they also never said yes. It was a very delicate thing, because we have a long-standing relationship with them and pushing too much wasn't advisable, but the conversations with Nintendo never ended. Ever since those conversations started however, Isaac went through some pretty drastic changes. Putting the game on the original 3DS now proved to be an almost impossible task, at least without cutting content and getting decent performance. To give people the full experience, the team made the decision to only port the game to the new 3DS, which was more than capable of properly running the game with all its content intact. Yet another DLC pack called Afterbirth was released in October 2015, adding over 100 hours to an already jam-packed experience. A new final area, 10 new challenges, a new playable character, 120 new items, 8 new bosses and a new wave-based mode called Greed Mode are just a couple of the new features that were added in Afterbirth. After this, Tyrone suggested implementing mod tools for the next big update and Edmund was immediately on board. Sadly, around this time, the developer was going through some very difficult personal stuff. Afterbirth Plus was developed at a time where I wasn't really available to develop. It was a messed up situation. A lot of stuff in my personal life, I wasn't able to be there and guide things as much as I wanted to. Development continued without much involvement from Edmund and in January 2017, the new expansion was ready to be released and featured the initial big idea for modding support, as well as smaller additions like a few new bosses, items and a bestiary. The mod support included a room editor, animation editor, Lua support and the ability to edit the item pools. This was a pretty big deal for the Binding Advisor community and allowed modders to more easily create their own content like never before. Despite giving the fanbase something new to be excited about, the release of Afterbirth Plus actually caused a split within the community. See, a couple of months prior to its release, a fan mod called Antibirth became available to play and it was actually so good that a lot of people preferred playing it over the official content, especially since Afterbirth Plus had a lot of problems during its initial release. Edmund immediately took notice of the fan-made expansion and was very impressed with the result, praising the mod online. He even contacted Vin, the lead designer and programmer of the whole project to talk about all things Isaac. Meanwhile, new features were being added to Afterbirth Plus in the form of booster packs. These booster packs added smaller chunks of content that were almost entirely made by the modding community. Unfortunately, Edmund and his team faced some technical issues implementing these smaller updates. There were definitely a bunch of issues that I hadn't foreseen at all. I simply didn't have a great technical understanding of how this would all go down and we only had one person, Adrian Gavrilida, who was the lead programmer on Afterbirth Plus, so it ended up taking a lot longer than I thought. The first three booster packs still came out relatively on time over the course of four months and the last two packs were made in collaboration with some of the modders behind Antibirth. These final updates were very ambitious and easily on par with traditional paid DLC, according to Edmund. While the booster packs aimed to fix the lackluster release of Afterbirth Plus, there was still a lot of content missing from the much-celebrated Antibirth mod. To give the fans what they want, the Isaac creator officially announced in September 2018 that another major expansion was in the works called Repentance. Edmund tweeted that he was working together with the team that created Antibirth to bring the fan-favorite mod into the official game and make it canon. It's been delayed multiple times over the years as the DLC kept growing in scope and the team also wanted to eliminate as many bugs as possible before launch. When Repentance was nearing its release, Edmund even said that it was basically a sequel with the amount of content it holds. It was eventually released for PC in March 2021, with console versions coming later this year. According to the devs, Repentance added pretty much everything that was in Antibirth and way way more on top of that. New areas, over 100 new enemies and more than 25 new bosses, over 130 new items, new playable characters, a true local co-op mode, hundreds of remade sprites and 10 new challenges are just some of the new features that were added. Additionally, a lot of the base game was tweaked and the meta was also changed to make everything feel fresh for veteran players. Edmund has mentioned in the past that Repentance is the final DLC for The Binding of Isaac, but that doesn't mean development has stopped. The team is still hard at work bringing Repentance to consoles and Edmund is also thinking of releasing additional smaller pieces of content that didn't make it for release. However, during some recent interviews with popular Isaac streamers, he said that another big expansion or updates like booster packs will never happen again. That being said, it's safe to say the indie developer is far from done with The World of Isaac. He's already released a prequel to The Binding of Isaac called The Legend of Bumbo in 2019, as well as a board game called The Binding of Isaac 4 Souls that was released in late 2018. Isaac is kind of more like a universe to me and I want to just keep expanding it and making it cooler. Edmund has already confirmed that a sequel will happen one day, but we shouldn't expect it anytime soon. The thought of a sequel has been in his head for a while now and he's actually implemented some of those ideas in Repentance and previous expansions. As of today, however, he has no idea yet what the next chapter might look like. The developer is far too busy with other projects like Mugenix to focus on the future of Isaac right now. As for Edmund's previous co-developer, Tommy Refenes, it seems like he and Edmund have gone their separate ways. Back in 2012, when Edmund was working hard on the Wrath of the Lamp expansion, he told Gamasutra that Tommy was working on the new engine for Team Meat's next game, which most likely would have been an iPhone game. Ever since Isaac kept growing in popularity and demanding more time from Edmund, it's been more quiet surrounding their work relationship. Tommy made a Super Meat Boy sequel called Super Meat Boy Forever, which was released in December 2020 on Nintendo Switch and PC. In an interview with Videogamer.com, he talked about his old co-partner. I still follow his work and I'm still a fan. We are on two different paths that I doubt we'll cross again. Our individual paths are going to bring more and better games to the fans while keeping us both happy with the work we're doing. To close out the video, I'd like to show a clip from the documentary Indie Game The Movie where Edmund summarizes how he feels about being a game developer and what motivates him every day to create. Like, I know that there is a kid out there who stayed up all night long for the game to come out and then didn't go to school the next day because he was so into playing it. And that even far exceeds my experiences when I was younger. And to think that I could make something that could have an impact on this kid even creatively into thinking, hey, I know two guys made this. Like maybe I can make something too. It's just cool. It's really cool. It feels really, really good. It's really good.

How Shovel Knight Was Made and Started as a Joke [xMikv4TFQ6A]:
Shovel Knight is perhaps one of the best examples of a retro indie game as it intentionally tries to emulate the spirit of 2D NES platformers from back in the day. While the game has garnered a lot of success during its almost 7 year dev cycle, the company went through quite a lot of internal struggles to provide players with a ton of free updates that were essentially completely new games in their own right. One of those problems was money, despite the incredibly successful Kickstarter that unlocked every single stretch goal. Before taking a closer look at Shovel Knight's development, let's first talk about the people behind the game and how they formed Yacht Club Games. The original members of the indie studio all previously worked at another independent studio called WayForward, who you might know from games like the Shantae series, Contra 4, A DuckTales Remastered and a lot of other licensed games. It's a rather large company that works on multiple projects at the same time and every project is assigned to a different set of developers. The team that worked on Double Dragon Neon, which was released in 2012, became close friends during its development and they all felt like they had perfect chemistry together. Therefore, the developers wanted to explore what other kinds of games they could create next. Unfortunately, WayForward told them it wasn't possible to keep their team together and that they would have to split up for future projects. However, the developers had so much faith in their synergy as a team that they decided to leave WayForward and start their own company. Before there was ever the idea for Shovel Knight, the team knew they wanted to make something that adopted a simpler style of gameplay, much like the classic NES games from the 80s. Shovel Knight was always conceived of as an 8-bit game. Even before there was a Shovel, we knew that we wanted to make a game that allowed the gameplay to naturally grow, born out of a few core mechanics. Harkening back to a time when that was how all games were made was an obvious choice. Additionally, that meant that we could create more content faster. When an enemy or object only has a few frames, iteration turnaround time is greatly reduced. This allowed us to focus on what matters most, the gameplay and experience of the player. In January 2013, the team was brainstorming about what kind of mechanics to implement in their 8-bit game, which at this point didn't feature the Shovel Knight protagonist yet. They brought up the downtrust from Zelda II, one of their personal favorites. The devs started to imagine hitting enemies from above and how you would then also dig through blocks on the ground. Perhaps you could even flip enemies over to hit their underbellies. That type of motion didn't quite fit with a sword-wielding knight though and eventually one of the developers jokingly suggested letting the knight wield a shovel instead. I guess if he's a shovel guy then he's like Plummet Knight or maybe he's Shovel Knight, the shoveling knight. And just like that, Shovel Knight was born. The team quickly got to work in director Sean Valesco's crammed apartment and started preparing for a Kickstarter campaign. They divided their time between building a strong proof of concept that included a demo as well as preparing everything for the Kickstarter itself. About two months later, Yacht Club Games had built enough assets and launched their Kickstarter on March 17th, 2013. Their minimum funding goal was set to $75,000, although the team knew they would have to compromise their vision if they didn't hit any stretch goals. It almost seemed like that was going to be the case, because halfway through the Kickstarter, they managed to raise $50,000. The team started getting nervous, especially since they were still hard at work finishing the demo that needed to be playable at that year's PAX. It was a very stressful time for the studio to say the least. It's very taxing on a team, especially as small as ours, to put everything on Kickstarter, to put it all on the line. It's very hard to find time to work on a game at all when you're doing Kickstarter, even just the campaign and the stuff you have to do afterwards, like the physical rewards. The PAX gaming convention was slated to start nine days after they launched the Kickstarter, so time was running out. Fortunately, the studio was able to finish the demo just in time for the big event, providing the opportunity for people to try out Shovel Knight at their booth. People were extremely positive about the NES-inspired platformer and not just regular visitors, but also the press. The likes of Destructoid and Kotaku started writing articles about the game and its Kickstarter, generating valuable marketing when the indie studio needed it most. On top of that, other developers that had done successful Kickstarters before, played the demo at PAX and gave some good advice. By far the most valuable advice was to distribute their demo to big YouTubers. Right after they came back from PAX, the studio started sending out demos to popular YouTubers like Game Grumps and those videos combined accumulated millions and millions of views. Almost overnight, the Kickstarter became a huge success and started hitting stretch goals in quick succession. On the last day of the Kickstarter, Yacht Club was able to raise over $300,000 with almost 15,000 people backing the project. One of the studio's programmers, David DeAngelo, contributed some of the success to nostalgia and the lack of a new Mega Man game at the time. Everyone was saying, there will never be a Mega Man game again, I'm so sad. And then here we come storming in with this game that feels much like a Mega Man experience. He further said that nostalgia works well on Kickstarter because it's something people can immediately understand. They still make Mario and Rayman, but there's nothing new there. The idea of seeing a new IP where the character is the name of the game was a cool thing to see. Being able to draw on the feelings people had when they were eight years old, worked for the Kickstarter. The developers couldn't believe what had happened, although reality started to sink in quickly. All the positive reception was very uplifting to the team, but now they not only had to develop the base game, but also many extra modes on top like New Game Plus, a challenge mode, a gender swap mode, a four-player battle mode, three additional playable characters and so on. Their original promise of a release in September 2013 was looking almost impossible to keep. Now that the studio had a lot more money to work with and a lot more content to implement as a result, they postponed the release date to early 2014. The team received a lot of emails asking why it was going to take so long, since the Kickstarter gave the impression that Shovel Knight was already far into development, but the director Sean explained most of the game just didn't exist yet and that the Kickstarter trailer and the PAX demo was literally everything the team had developed up until that point. Once the funds from Kickstarter came through around May 2013, the developers decided to leave behind Sean's apartment for a real office space to properly continue development. The next couple of months, the studio mostly focused on finishing the base game and decided to worry about the Stretch Goal DLC later. As mentioned before, the devs took inspiration from Zelda II, starting with the downthrust. Additionally, Shovel Knight's world has a village very similar to Zelda II, where random passerby will chat up Shovel Knight. The team wanted their characters to just be as goofy and fun as the ones you'd find in the land of Hyrule. Fun fact, all the NPC characters looked like default horse person sprites, while the studio was figuring out what the gameplay function of each NPC was. Another strong inspiration was Mega Man and this is evidenced by the room-based themed stages and their bosses, as well as the title of the game being the name of the protagonist. The heavy use of items in the game is directly inspired by Castlevania, because the developers thought it was interesting how Castlevania doesn't force you to use the items, but they still play a major part in how you can tackle each scenario and enemy in the game. They wanted to replicate that feeling in Shovel Knight and extend it even further by making the items useful in many ways, whether it be for platforming, enemies or bosses. The team has also stated that the world map was inspired by both Mario 3 and UN Squadron. Mario 3 remains on our minds when we recall what it's like to traverse a large NES world filled with surprises, while UN Squadron has more of a tiered map approach that allows the player a choice in where they want to go while still escalating the challenge, without throwing the player into a completely flat stage structure. Some people speculated that the downthrust might have also been inspired by the DuckTales game, but the team has gone on record saying it was mostly just inspired by Zelda 2. However, they did mention that the feeling of discovering hidden treasure in Shovel Knight was certainly inspired by DuckTales. Mother 3 was also looked at for inspiration, specifically for the story. The team wanted to emotionally engage the player in some way like Mother 3 does. This led to the idea that Shovel Knight had to bury his wife at the end of the game with his shovel, but this was ultimately changed for a less melancholic ending. Interestingly enough, Shield Knight wasn't much of a character at the start of development and only existed to motivate Shovel Knight. She was apparently even nicknamed Princess MacGuffin for a while. There's also some Dark Souls in Shovel Knight, because the developers wanted to come up with a mechanic that places an important emphasis on player death, just like Dark Souls did. This led to the implementation of the checkpoint system, something that went through many changes to balance the difficulty. It first started as invisible checkpoints, much like the Mega Man games. However, they wanted to make it more physical and they also didn't want to have too many checkpoints since that would make the game too easy. Instead of turning down the amount of checkpoints though, the team instead decided to give the players the choice of spending money to activate a checkpoint, adding even more value to the currency system in the game while also providing more player agency. That iteration of the system was a problem for inexperienced players however, since there was no guarantee that every player would be able to collect enough money to activate the checkpoints in the first place. Yacht Club didn't want the platformer to be too easy, but also not too difficult so that more people could enjoy playing it. The developers wanted to find a way to satisfy both experienced and inexperienced players. So, one day, they had the idea of giving players the option to eliminate a checkpoint in return for some extra gems, adding a risk-reward system to the checkpoint mechanic. The team wanted to stick to the NES aesthetics and therefore potential limitations as close as possible. It almost had to look like it would be possible to play Shovel Knight on an actual NES console and this meant sticking to the limited 54 colors the NES was capable of producing for example. However, in some cases, they did decide to break out of those limitations when they couldn't find a compelling reason to keep them in the game or if they would hamstring the gameplay experience. An example of this is sprite flickering, which occurred when the NES tried to display more than 8 sprites per horizontal line. This effect is nostalgic for some, but we felt it was detrimental, so we nixed it. However, we did make gameplay design decisions based on the idea of sprite flickering. We tried to avoid cluttering the screen with on-screen objects and limited things like particle effects. Being aware of the rules in this case led to the game feeling clear and simple, one of the hallmarks of a great NES game. The team also extended the viewable screen space to a 16x9 resolution in order to eliminate the black bars on a white screen. However, David explained they didn't change the resolution in terms of making Shovel Knight a pixel-dense HD game. They kept the same vertical and tile size dimensions and the extra horizontal space was used to optimize the level design for puzzles, more objects and to give the player more breathing room. Shovel Knight also has lots of background parallax scrolling and for those that don't know, parallax scrolling is the ability to shift different layers or parts of the screen at different rates, giving 2D layers the appearance of 3D movement. That effect was only possible on the NES with lots of trickery and was much more common on the SNES. Early on with Shovel Knight, the studio decided to amp up the parallax scrolling, creating an average of five to six layers of backgrounds to scroll by. They were able to more easily implement this effect with their own custom C++ engine that supports 3D and uses DirectX on PC and OpenGL on Mac and Linux. As mentioned earlier, the developers wanted to stick to the NES color palette as much as possible, meaning they only had access to 54 colors in total. In the end, they only added a few extra colors and mostly stuck to the original color palette, giving Shovel Knight a very distinctive look. Sprites on the NES were limited to four colors, or three colors plus transparency, but games like the Mega Man series used a trick that involved splitting up sprites into two separate ones. This allowed sprites to have four to five colors in addition to transparency and therefore the team decided to treat Shovel Knight sprites like Mega Man. Getting that balance right was a tricky process according to David. A character with too many colors would stick out like a sore thumb, so they had to work back and forth with detail levels and colors until they found a combo that looked great. The studio used a pixel art tool called ProMotion to create all the sprites and animations and for their level editor they used a free tool called Tiled. Another example of how the devs broke the NES limitations is implementing a more advanced camera shake effect. The NES was only able to execute a camera shake on a single axis because of the console's difficulties doing diagonal scrolling. Shovel Knight obviously didn't have this problem, so the team was able to create a camera shake effect. The soundtrack was created by composer Jake Kaufman and in order to simulate the audio of the NES, he used a free tool called Famitracker. The tool is able to export music in NES machine code, which is capable of running on an actual NES or Famicom console, with all of its limitations and hardware quirks. Afterwards he finalized the sounds using mastering tools like EQ and compression to give it some extra punch on today's sound equipment, but avoided using reverb effects or stereo mixing which would destroy the raw character of the sounds. Any echoes or special effects are programmed note by note, the way they were on the NES. David and the rest of the team were very pleased with the final look and feel of Shovel Knight and how it retained that classic NES style. When you add up all the changes, it seems like there is a vast gulf between Shovel Knight and the technology of the NES. However, we feel that the core of the aesthetics of the 8-bit era has been respected and perhaps even enhanced. Shovel Knight was a dream project, allowing us to explore a style of game that's rarely seen today. It was fascinating to try and problem solve the technical issues of yesteryear, while avoiding any pitfalls that would belie real modernity. We hope that by being true to the NES in more than just superficial ways, we've built fanciful rock-solid fundamentals. While the game was scheduled to release early 2014, the team had to further delay it to June 2014. During those last few months of development, Yacht Club was in some serious financial trouble. The Kickstarter campaign brought in much more money than they ever thought possible, but when they ran the numbers on developing the base game and the additional stretch goals, Shovel Knight needed a much bigger budget. The developers started cutting costs wherever possible, but the delays also meant they had to stretch their budget for a longer time period, something they hadn't foreseen. We ended up operating for five months without money or payments to the team here. It was a difficult period, where some of us were awkwardly standing in front of cashiers having our credit cards declined, drawing from any possible savings and borrowing money from our friends and family. Luckily, once Shovel Knight was released on June 26th, 2014, it became a huge success for the small studio. Reviewers and gamers around the world had nothing but positive things to say about every aspect of the NES-inspired game. Additionally, Shovel Knight even took home the Best Independent Game award at the Game Awards show in 2014. Besides critical acclaim, the platformer also exceeded the team's sales expectations and after only a month, Shovel Knight had sold around 180,000 copies. By September 2019, that number increased to 2.65 million copies sold on all available platforms. All this success meant the studio was able to continue development on Shovel Knight without having to worry too much about their budget. The DLC featured three additional single-player campaigns and each campaign allowed the player to take control of one of the boss knights, which drastically changed the gameplay compared to the original Shovel Knight experience. Each campaign was released as a free update, among other free content that was part of the original Kickstarter stretch goals. The PS4 and Xbox versions even received exclusive content, with the former featuring a boss fight with Kratos from God of War and the latter a boss fight with the Battletoads. In 2017, the original campaign was renamed to Shovel of Hope and this was partially done to communicate to players that the additional DLC weren't just character swaps, but rather completely new games with their own kind of gameplay and levels. The title was later even changed from Shovel Knight to Shovel Knight Treasure Trove and this version included every piece of DLC. All previous owners of the original game were able to upgrade to the Treasure Trove edition for free. For the sake of not making this video too long, I'm not going to expand on the game design decisions of the DLC, but I do want to touch on another difficult period in Yacht Club Games' history, which took place during the development of the DLC. Plague of Shadows, the first additional campaign, which was originally going to be nothing more than a character swap, had turned into something that resembled more of a sequel than anything else. Of course, by doing this the team gave themselves a lot of extra work and overtime and my the end of 2015, after the release of Plague of Shadows, the team was burned out. Unfortunately, the studio couldn't take much of a break since they still had some Kickstarter promises to keep. However, they did make a promise to themselves to never get so close to the breaking point again and avoid periods of crunch in the future. So, in 2016, the studio made a plan to finish the next two campaigns in a more efficient way and by now the team had also grown from five to around a dozen developers. While Spectre of Torment came out without too much trouble, the third and final campaign King of Cards kept increasing in scope. To avoid burning out again, the decision was made to delay the release of the King Knight campaign and this time they didn't have to worry about stretching their budget since it was now practically unlimited thanks to the sales of Shovel Knight. By December 2019, all the Kickstarter promises were fulfilled and every backer and owner of the original Shovel Knight was able to claim every piece of DLC for free. To say the developers were relieved after that is putting it lightly. Looking back, the studio, despite the struggles, feels very blessed to have been able to go on this development journey and create one of the most beloved indie games in the past decade. I feel lucky, just really lucky to have been able to work on a game for six years. There have been real rough spots, but overall, we got to do so much cool stuff. We got to fly to Japan and go to Nintendo and talk to them. We got to have an amiibo. We got to have Manami Matsume make these songs. We got to meet all our favorite game developers and go to shows. The game's been a success. It's been amazing. We've been real lucky.
