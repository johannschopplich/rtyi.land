# Title Ideas

## Beyond the Cartridge: The Making of Return to Yoshi's Island

This title emphasizes the documentary's focus on the development process and the people behind the game, suggesting a deep dive into the creative journey.

## A Fan's Fury: Remaking an Island

This title is more intriguing. "Fury" speaks to Kaze's passionate, intense, and sometimes frustrated dedication, and is a nod to game titles like "Bowser's Fury," which he doesn't like.
