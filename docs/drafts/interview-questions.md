# Interview Questions for the RTYI Team

The questions are open-ended to establish core themes and encourage storytelling. I will actively listen for interesting stories to follow up on and dive into specific, role-oriented topics.

::: tip Global Audience Focus
This documentary targets an audience who may never have heard of ROM hacking, N64 development, or the Mario 64 modding scene. I want to encourage interviewees to naturally explain technical concepts, define jargon, and provide context that makes their work accessible to everyone.
:::

### For All Team Members

These central questions are for Kaze, Biobak, Badub, and Zeina individually. This will hopefully allow me to weave together their different perspectives on the same key topics, creating a multi-faceted narrative for the documentary.

1.  **The Project:** Tell me about "Return to Yoshi's Island" - what is this project you've spent years of your life creating? What does it mean to take a beloved classic like Super Mario 64 and transform it into something entirely new?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Help viewers understand: What is ROM hacking? What makes this different from typical game mods?
    - The SM64 decompilation project - how did this change what was possible?
    - Why Yoshi's Island specifically? What about that game captured your imagination?
    - For people who've never heard of this scene - what drives someone to rebuild a 30-year-old game from the ground up?

    :::

2.  **The Genesis:** I'd love to hear how you first got involved with this project. What aspects of this specific idea resonated with you? What made you decide to commit to such a huge undertaking?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Initial excitement or skepticism when you first heard about the project
    - What was Kaze's pitch like to get you involved?
    - Personal nostalgia for Super Mario 64 or Yoshi's Island
    - **Kaze - The Real Origin Story**: "The zoo is actually the reason I even started optimizing Mario 64. The zoo ran so poorly that I just could not take that." Can you take me back to that specific moment when you decided enough was enough? For people unfamiliar with game development, help us understand what "lag" means and why fixing it required such extreme measures.
    - **Kaze - The Yoshi Connection**: "I like Yoshi. That's kind of where the thought process ended." What does that mean to you on a deeper level? What is it about Yoshi specifically that made this project worth years of your life?
    - **Kaze - Scope Realization**: Did you understand from the start that fixing one laggy level would lead to rewriting collision systems, sound engines, and graphics pipelines? How did fixing one problem reveal that the entire engine needed rebuilding?
    - **Team Members**: How did you realize this wasn't going to be a typical ROM hack but something much more ambitious?

    :::

3.  **The Drive:** This is years of work, all released for free. Kaze has described it as requiring an obsessive level of dedication, costing him "tens of thousands" personally. What keeps you going? What's the personal drive that makes you pour so much time and talent into this?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - **The Creative Cycle**: "It always starts like really fun and eventually it turns into pure torture. That's just the cycle of making games." How do you navigate this emotional rollercoaster?
    - How do you push through burnout or creative blocks?
    - The desire to push the N64 to its limits and prove what's possible on 30-year-old hardware
    - **Financial Reality**: The "tens of thousands" in opportunity cost and reliance on community donations. How do you balance passion with practical concerns?
    - **Mental State**: "If you want to finish a Mario 64 major hack you need to be mentally ill" vs. "I'm not motivated at all... I just do it. It's really that easy." How do you reconcile the obsession required with the disciplined, workmanlike approach?
    - **Quality Standards**: "If they weren't even good enough for Mario 64, why would they be good enough for my game?" How does using Nintendo's classic as your quality benchmark drive you forward?

    :::

4.  **The Soul of RTYI:** From your role on the team, what do you think is the heart and soul of this game? What feeling or experience are you trying to create that makes it different from any other Mario 64 hack or even official Nintendo games?
