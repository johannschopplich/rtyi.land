# Interview Questions for the RTYI Team

The questions are open-ended to establish core themes and encourage storytelling. I will actively listen for interesting stories to follow up on and dive into specific, role-oriented topics.

### Part 1: For All Team Members

These central questions are for Kaze, Biobak, Badub, and Zeina individually. This will hopefully allow me to weave together their different perspectives on the same key topics, creating a multi-faceted narrative for the documentary.

1.  **The Genesis:** Let's go back to the beginning. Can you tell me how you first became involved with "Return to Yoshi's Island"? What was it about this specific idea that captured your imagination? A massive, Yoshi's Island-themed adventure built on top of the Mario 64 engine. What made you decide to commit to such a huge project?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Initial excitement or skepticism.
    - What was Kaze's initial pitch to you?
    - Personal nostalgia for Super Mario 64 or Yoshi's Island.

    :::

2.  **The Drive:** This is a multi-year project, often described by Kaze as requiring an obsessive level of dedication, all to be released for free. From your perspective, what is the personal drive or passion that keeps you dedicated to investing so much of your time and talent?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - The joy of creation vs. the "torture" of the grind.
    - What keeps you going during moments of burnout?
    - The desire to push the N64 or prove what's possible.

    :::

3.  **The Soul of RTYI:** From your unique role on the team, what do you believe is the _soul_ of "Return to Yoshi's Island"? What is the core feeling or experience you are all trying to create, and how does that make it different from any other Mario 64 hack or even official Nintendo games?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - The game's specific "vibe" (e.g., "placeness," "excitement").
    - How does the "Yoshi" theme influence your work?
    - The blend of nostalgia and innovation.

    :::

4.  **The Creative Process:** This project is a major collaboration. Could you walk me through the typical creative process? How does an idea go from a concept to a finished piece that we see in the game? Whether it's for a level, a song, a model, or an animation?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Initial briefs or discussions.
    - How is feedback exchanged (Discord, live stream, etc.)?
    - The back-and-forth between Kaze's technical needs and your artistic contribution.

    :::

5.  **A Story of a Challenge:** Every big project has its hurdles. Can you share a story about a particularly difficult challenge you faced? Be it a technical nightmare, a creative block, or a team disagreement? And what was the breakthrough or moment of triumph that followed?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - A specific bug, a difficult model, a challenging composition.
    - A time an idea wasn't working and had to be scrapped.
    - The feeling of finally solving the problem.

    :::

6.  **The N64 Spirit:** You're developing for 30-year-old hardware in the modern era. How do the famous limitations of the N64 force you to be more creative? For example the low-poly models, the texture memory, the processing power, the sound font? Can you give an example of a feature or an aesthetic choice in RTYI that exists _because_ of a limitation, not in spite of it?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Specific workarounds for polycount or texture size.
    - How limitations foster a unique, recognizable art or music style.
    - CPU-based normal mapping, creative use of sound font, etc.

    :::

7.  **The Legacy:** When players finally get their hands on the full game, what is the one essential feeling or experience you hope they take away from it? In your eyes, what will be the lasting legacy of "Return to Yoshi's Island"?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - What do you want players to remember most?
    - What does this project represent for the SM64 modding community?

#### Kaze Emanuar (Lead Developer)

::: tip Introduction Reminder

- For the narrative, can you please state your name and your role on the project?

:::

**On Vision & Design Philosophy**

1.  You have very clear design principles: creating "placeness," prioritizing "excitement over difficulty," and respecting the player's time. Can you give a specific example from RTYI where you had to make a tough decision to uphold one of these principles, perhaps even scrapping an idea like the "Space Arcade" that you initially liked?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - AAA games as a "chore."
    - His "Cowboyaboo" or "Craft Level" philosophies.
    - Removing 100-coin stars and "boot out" stars.

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - "If you can see it, you can go there."
    - The "tease" of seeing a future landmark.
    - Permanently changing the world (Rain Flower, Dory rescue).

    :::

**On Technical Mastery**

1.  You didn't just hack SM64; you fundamentally rewrote massive parts of it – the sound engine, the collision system, even the (optimized LibUltra). What drove you to take on these immense tasks, and what specific gameplay experience in RTYI would be impossible without them?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Vanilla collision being "unusable."
    - The audio engine being "fucked."
    - Collaboration with Soren on F3DEX3.

    :::

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Performance profiler tools.
    - Crashes that "just work" on some emulators.

    :::

**On Collaboration & The Public Eye**

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Biobak's level reworks ("Holy shit, everything is different").
    - Badub's cowboy music solidifying the "vibe."
    - Zeina's "mutant Yoshi" boss concept.

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - "Feelings are real, reasoning is stupid."
    - How stream helps vs. hinders focus.
    - Specific examples of chat ideas being implemented.

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - Strategic release timing.
    - Copyright-free trailers.
    - The plan to asset-swap for a commercial game.

::: tip Introduction Reminder

- For the narrative, can you please state your name and your role on the project?

:::

**On Visuals & World-Building**

1.  Kaze often shows a level in a basic "grey box" state and then, later, a "Biobak rework" that completely transforms it. Can you walk me through your artistic process of taking one of those functional layouts and infusing it with life, atmosphere, and "placeness"? I love the "Oily Boily Bay" and Course 1 reworks.

    - Before/after comparisons.
    - Kaze's stream reaction to your reworks.
    - Your detailed changelogs.

    - Receiving MS Paint maps or blockout models.
    - Your role as an idea contributor, shaping the level's flow.

    :::

2.  Creating detailed, modern-looking assets for the N64 is a huge challenge. What is your process for managing polycounts, texture memory, and color palettes to create something that looks beautiful but still performs well on the original hardware?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - How Kaze's "vibe" description translates into music.

    :::

**On The Craft of N64 Music**

1.  Composing for the N64 is a unique technical craft. How do its limitations shape your compositions? For example the small sound font, the ROM space, and the audio engine. Do you see them as restrictions or as creative opportunities?

    ::: info Follow-ups

    - The OST taking up a significant portion of the 64MB cartridge.
    - The challenge of Kaze's custom sound engine.
