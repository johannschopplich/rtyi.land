## Project Origins & Philosophies

**Main Focus:** Understanding the vision, passion and mindset required to begin a project of this scale.

### How It All Started

- **Narrative Goal:** The central contrast of creating a visually stunning, modern-feeling game on a 30-year-old console. Who would take on this challenge, and why?
- **Topics to Cover:**
  - **Background:** Kaze's history with both _Super Mario 64_ and _Yoshi's Island_. Which specific elements (aesthetic, mechanics, "vibe") from _Yoshi's Island_ did he want to fuse with SM64's 3D platforming?
  - **Core Motivation:** Explore his straightforward starting point: "I like Yoshi." What does this mean to him personally (nostalgia, art, and feeling)?
  - **Technical Foundation:** How the SM64 decompilation project opened up possibilities that weren't available in traditional ROM hacking.
  - **The Reality:** Acknowledging this as a fan project in a legally uncertain space that will never be sold commercially.
- **B-Roll:**
  - RTYI gameplay juxtaposed with classic SM64 and SNES Yoshi's Island footage.
  - Archival footage of the N64 console and era.

### Kaze's Philosophy

- **Narrative Goal:** Understanding Kaze's principles of game design and creative mindset.
