## Project Origins & Philosophies

**Central Theme:** The vision, passion, and mindset required to begin a project of this scale.

### The Spark

- **Narrative Goal:** Establish the project's central paradox: a visually stunning, modern-feeling game on a 30-year-old console. Who would do this, and why?
- **Key Content:**
  - **Introduction:** Kaze's history with _Super Mario 64_ and _Yoshi's Island_. What specific elements (aesthetic, mechanics, "vibe") from _Yoshi's Island_ did he want to fuse with SM64's 3D platforming?
  - **The "Why":** Explore his simple, powerful starting point: "I like Yoshi." What does this statement mean to him in terms of nostalgia, art, and feeling?
  - **The Catalyst:** The role of the SM64 decompilation project as the key to creative freedom compared to traditional ROM hacking.
  - **The Conflict:** Frame this as a fan game, a passion project in a legal grey area that will never be sold.
- **B-Roll:**
  - RTYI gameplay juxtaposed with classic SM64 and SNES Yoshi's Island footage.
  - Archival footage of the N64 console.

### Kaze's Philosophy

- **Narrative Goal:** Define Kaze's principles of game design and his creative mindset.
