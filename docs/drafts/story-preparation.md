# Documentary Interview & Story Preparation

This document outlines key narrative arcs and themes to explore during interviews with Kaze Emanuar, Biobak, Badub, and Zeina. Each arc is a potential "mini-story" that can be woven into the final documentary. The goal is to capture the "why" and "how" behind the project, focusing on creative processes, technical challenges of high-level ROM hacking, and the creators' personal stories, ensuring the final film is accessible to a non-technical audience.

::: tip Plan
This outline is to serve as a guide for the filming process. This will allow the final story to emerge organically from the interviews themselves (and editing process), while ensuring all essential narrative beats are covered.
:::

## Project Origins & Philosophies

**Central Theme:** The vision and the mindset required to begin a project of this scale.

### The Spark

- **Narrative Goal:** To pose the central question: Why build a visually stunning, modern-feeling game on a 30-year-old console?
- **Key Content:**
  - **Introduction:** Kaze's personal history with _Super Mario 64_ and _Yoshi's Island_. What specific elements (aesthetic, mechanics, "vibe") from _Yoshi's Island_ did he want to fuse with SM64's 3D platforming?
  - **Spark:** Kaze's simple, direct motivation: "I like Yoshi. That's kind of where the thought process ended." What does that statement mean to him (nostalgia, art, specific feeling he wanted to capture)?
  - **Nintendo Elephant:** The project's status as a fan game – a non-commercial passion project existing in a legal grey area.
  - ~~The role of the SM64 decompilation project as the catalyst that made this technically possible.~~
- **B-Roll:**
  - RTYI gameplay (craft level, oil rig, dynamic overworld) juxtaposed with classic, blocky SM64 footage.
  - Footage of SM64 and the N64 console.

### Kaze's Philosophy

- **Narrative Goal:** To establish Kaze's principles of game design.
- **Key Content:**
  - **Core Principles:** Explore his key philosophies mentioned in the streams: "excitement over difficulty," creating a "feeling" and "placeness," avoiding "modern game design" tropes, and his critique of "safe" AAA games.
  - **Evolution as a Designer:** Contrast RTYI with "Last Impact." Use his quote: "Back when I making last impact I just like whenever I had an idea i would just put it in almost like unfiltered." How has his approach matured?
  - **The Mindset:** His belief that you must be "mentally unwell" to succeed in game development. Explore what this means to him – is it about obsession, perseverance, or a unique way of thinking?
- **B-Roll:**
  - Kaze at his workstation.
  - Gameplay from various courses that visualize his design principles.

- **Key Content:**
  - **Music as Inspiration:** Use Kaze's quote: "I love working with a song already made for the level because it gives me so many ideas for the vibe." Explore a specific case, like how the "Cowboy Level" music arrived mid-stream and instantly solidified the level's atmosphere for Kaze.
  - **Technical Artistry:** The challenge of composing for the N64's limited sound font. The ambition of a dynamic overworld soundtrack with seamless transitions between nearly 20 tracks.
  - **Collaboration:** How does Kaze communicate the desired mood for a level to Badub? How are drafts reviewed? How is the final music integrated to time with cutscenes or events?
- **B-Roll:**
  - Footage of Badub's composition software.
  - Gameplay footage scored by different musical concepts, showing how the "vibe" changes.

### Zeina

- **Narrative Goal:** To highlight Zeina's roles in giving the world character through animation, art, and playtesting.
- **Key Content:**
  - **Animation:** Showcase the process of animating a key character, like the Wiggler or the "Piano Guy." How does she convey personality within the N64's technical constraints?

## Case Studies

**Central Theme:** The messy, iterative, challenging, and ultimately rewarding process of building a level. Use specific levels as self-contained stories.

### The Cowboy Level: Finding the "Vibe"

::: tip Highlight
This is my favorite arc. It captures the essence of Kaze's creative process and the collaborative spirit of the team.
:::

- **Narrative Goal:** To show the process of establishing a level's identity from scratch, highlighting the collaboration synergy of the team.
- **Key Content:**
  - **The Vision:** Kaze's "Cowboyaboo" philosophy – an intentionally over-the-top, "goofy, funny" town.
  - **The "Shit Phase":** The struggle with art style. Kaze trying different building colors and textures. "This building style is just not exciting me."
  - **The Breakthrough:** Kaze's reaction when Badub's new music track arrives mid-stream: "Oh, this is so good... that's so perfect." The addition of the skybox and fog solidifies the "vibe."
  - **Collaboration:** Biobak's real-time suggestions in the chat to help Kaze iterate, Zeina animating the NPCs (Dry Bones, Piano Guy). A prime example of the team's workflow.
- **B-Roll:**

  - Footage of the early, "ugly" 3D blockout models with placeholder textures.
  - Kaze's face as he listens to Badub's new track for the first time.

### Course 1: The First Impression

- **Narrative Goal:** To show how the game's first level becomes a years-long endeavor that embodies the project's core philosophies: player-centric teaching, collaborative polish, and pursuit of the perfect "first step."
- **Key Content:**
  - **The Tutorial Problem:** RTYI has new, advanced movement. How do you teach it without hand-holding or intrusive text (rejection of N64-era text pop-ups)?
  - **Collaborative Solution:** "Tutorial Bunnies".
  - **Biobak's Idea:** Interactive rings to get a coin – forcing the player to perform the move, ensuring the mechanic is learned through action, not just instruction.
  - **Zeina:** Animations for the bunnies to visually demonstrate the new mechanics.
  - **Reworks:** Major visual and structural overhaul over the years by Biobak. Demonstrates the team's evolving quality standards and commitment to polishing even "finished" content.
- **B-Roll:**
  - Early gameplay showing the first, clunky versions of the tutorials.
  - Zeina's animation files for the bunnies next to the final in-game models.
  - Split-screen of the "before" and "after" of Biobak's major visual rework of the level.
  - Gameplay of a player successfully navigating the tutorial rings.

### The Craft Level: From "Stupid Idea" to Technical Achievement

- **Narrative Goal:** To show how a simple aesthetic led to deep technical innovation and creative problem-solving.
- **Key Content:**
  - The "crayon drawing" mechanic as a unique gameplay hook.
  - **Central Challenge:** The Styrofoam texture. How do you make styrofoam look shiny and real on a console that can't do modern lighting?
  - **Solution:** Kaze's invention of a "fake" lighting system (CPU-based normal mapping). Explain this accessibly!
  - Enemy design process: Brainstorming and rejecting ideas (scissors) before settling on thematic enemies like the "Thimble Shy Guys."
  - **Community Contribution:** Leila and others providing doodles and models.

### The Space Arcade: Killing Your Darlings

- **Narrative Goal:** The painful but necessary process of scrapping a bad idea.
- **Key Content:**
  - **Initial Idea:** Show the brainstorming for Course 15 ("Space Arcade" and pinball concepts). Kaze's initial excitement.
  - **The Realization:** Kaze's critique: "The idea we had for this level is terrible." His dislike of the "ugly arcade carpet." The feeling that it's not "Mario 64 spirit."
  - **The Breakthrough:** Live brainstorming session that leads to the "Shy Guy Space Station" concept. Highlight Kaze's commitment to quality over sunk cost.
- **B-Roll:**
  - The old, ugly arcade level vs. the new Shy Guy station.

## The Custom Engine

**Central Theme:** The necessity of invention. Why Kaze is not just _modifying_ a game, but developing an entirely new engine to make his vision possible.

- **Narrative Goal:** To explain accessibly why Kaze had to fundamentally rewrite core parts of a 30-year-old game engine and how those changes enabled the final creative product.
- **Key Content:**
  - **The Problem:** Limitations of the original code. The sound engine is "fucked," the vanilla collision is "unusable."
  - **The Solution:** Frame each engine overhaul as a response to a creative need.
    - **New Sound Engine:** To create a dynamic soundtrack with seamless transitions.
    - **New Collision System:** For a stable, consistent feel of Mario's movement and complex platforming.

- **B-Roll:**
  - Side-by-side comparisons of a bug/limitation in vanilla SM64 vs. the smooth result in RTYI.
  - Kaze looking at profiler data.

## The Overworld as a Character

**Central Theme:** Building a seamless, dynamic, secret-filled hub world, not just a level select screen.

- **Narrative Goal:** The design philosophy behind making the hub world the true "main character" of the game and the technical and creative challenges this presents.
- **Key Content:**
  - The importance of the Overworld as the "final stretch" and "most important part."
  - **The Philosophy:** "If you can see it, you can go there." Show the 360-degree mock-ups and Kaze's Photoshop sketches to visualize this ambition.
  - **The "Tease":** Focus on the design principle of "edging the player." Show the lighthouse visible from the starting area, and explain the path the player must take to eventually reach it.
  - **Player Impact:** Highlight the overworld events that permanently change the island. The "Rain Flower" concept as a mini-story: show the sad, rainy area, the quest to help the Yoshis, the flower turning happy, the rain stopping, and the star reward.

  - Fly-throughs of the 3D overworld blockout.
  - Kaze drawing paths in MS Paint.
  - Animations showing how one area connects to another.
  - Split-screen showing a "before" and "after" of an overworld event.

## The "Shit Phase" & The Art of Iteration

**Central Theme:** Creativity is not a lightning strike, but a messy, often frustrating, process of failure and refinement. This arc embraces the "ugly blockout" aesthetic and the pain of "killing your darlings."

- **Narrative Goal:** To demystify the creative process. Producing "crap" on the way to producing art.
- **Key Content:**
  - **The Mantra:** How levels always "look like shit at the beginning."
  - **Micro-Story 1: The Paper Plane.** Show the early attempts where the physics were a "volatile, chaotic system." Juxtapose footage of the clunky, failing plane with the final, swooping version.
  - **Micro-Story 2: The Minecart Chase.** The initial concept of swapping between carts deemed "really, really difficult." Show this failed concept, then the pivot to the more manageable single-platform design.
  - **Micro-Story 3: The Boss Redesigns.** Show the initial "tumors" on the Yoshi boss, then the "mushrooms" that replaced them. Show the evolution of Raphael the Raven from a simple walking enemy to one that erupts from the ground.
- **B-Roll:**
  - Montage of Kaze's ugliest placeholder models and blockouts.
  - Kaze on stream, sighing, rubbing his temples, saying "this sucks." Then, the moment of breakthrough, followed by footage of the polished, final version.

## Rethinking Rewards

**Central Theme:** Questioning the fundamentals. How Kaze reimagines one of gaming's most iconic systems: collectible coins and stars.

- **Narrative Goal:** Explain Kaze's vision for making player actions and rewards more meaningful and integrated into the world, rather than just being a checklist.
- **Key Content:**
  - **Yoshi Coins:** Kaze's critique of 100-Coin Stars and their replacement with Yoshi Coins. How they are not just collectibles?
  - **The Global Economy:** Coins aren't just for a star; they are a currency to _change the world_. Making coins "feel more valuable than Mario Odyssey."
  - **Rethinking Progression:** Encouraging immersion and continuous exploration with collectibles and value player time: "The game doesn't waste your time. That is important to me."
- **B-Roll:**
  - The game's UI showing the global coin counter.
  - Coins being given to an NPC, followed by an event that changes the world.

## Kaze & Zeina's Shared Creation

**Central Theme:** The unique collaboration of a creative and personal partnership.

- **Narrative Goal:** Provide an intimate, humanizing look at the core of the development team. This arc shows how the game's soul is shaped by the constant, informal, and deeply intertwined collaboration between Kaze and Zeina.
- **Key Content:**

  - **The Creative Feedback Loop:** This is the most visible part of their collaboration.

    - **From Concept to In-Game:** Showcase Zeina's direct artistic contributions. Use examples like the "mutant Yoshi" boss concept, the zoo entrance drawings, or the textures for the bulletin board and bunny footprints.
    - **The Animation Pipeline:** Detail the workflow where Kaze finishes programming logic and then is dependent on Zeina's animations to bring a character to life (e.g., the Bowser fight, the Wiggler). Use Kaze's quotes like, "all we're waiting now is for a few animations that zena's making." This establishes her work as a crucial, progress-gating step.
    - **Live Iteration:** Include stream clips where Kaze reviews Zeina's work in real-time. Examples: giving feedback on an animation's rotation point, asking for changes to a footprint texture, or implementing her new sobbing Koopa animation. This demonstrates a direct and immediate creative dialogue.

  - **The First and Most Important Playtester:**

    - **Narrative Focus:** Frame Zeina not just as an animator, but as the game's first true audience and a vital source of gameplay feedback.
    - **The Key Story:** The moment Kaze explicitly states he made a level easier because "it very painful to watch her" playtest it. This is a powerful, concrete example of how their shared experience directly impacts the game's design and accessibility.
    - **Interview Potential:** Ask them about this dynamic. Zeina's perspective on playing Kaze's notoriously difficult early builds would be incredibly insightful and likely humorous.

  - **Life Beyond the Code:**
    - **Narrative Goal:** To show that their collaboration isn't confined to development tasks.
    - **Humanizing Moments:** Weave in the personal anecdotes from the streams: making terrariums, Zeina cutting Kaze's "fucked up haircut," getting pizza, her presence in the house during streams ("She is currently upstairs..."). These moments ground the intense development process in the reality of a shared life.
    - **The Ultimate Collaboration: Parenthood.** This is a critical story beat. Introduce the fact that they are expecting a child in the final stretch of this multi-year project. This adds immense personal stakes, reframes Kaze's comments on financial needs, and transforms the story from just "making a game" to "making a game while building a family." It beautifully encapsulates the "human cost" and personal dedication.

- **B-Roll:**
  - Footage of Kaze and Zeina interacting during a stream (if any exists with her on mic/camera).
  - Screen-recordings of Kaze reviewing Zeina's submitted ".blend" or animation files.
  - Side-by-side shots of Zeina's concept art/sketches and the final 3D models in-game.
  - Gameplay footage of Zeina playtesting a level, perhaps with Kaze's live commentary overlaid.
  - Candid photos or short personal video clips of them together, if they are comfortable sharing, to emphasize the "Home Base" theme.
  - A simple, heartwarming shot of Kaze showing Zeina something he just finished on the screen.
