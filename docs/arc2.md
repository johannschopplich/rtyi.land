#### **Act 2: Forging an Impossible Island**

**Vignette 3: The Tyranny of the N64**

- **The Story:** A montage of the hardware fighting back. This is where you show the "hell" of N64 development.
- **Challenges:**
  - **RAM Limits:** Show Kaze realizing a level is out of memory. Use his quote: "this is a trick we do so we don't actually have to 3D model the stuff here because we are getting pretty close to running out of RAM."
  - **Emulator Hell:** His constant frustration with emulators. "This garbage emulator man I swear. I hate emulators."
  - **The 6.5-Day Bug:** A legendary, almost mythical bug that only appears after days of uptime.
  - **The F3DX3 Mystery:** The collaboration with Soren to fix the performance of a new microcode.
- **B-Roll:** Game crashing on N64 hardware. Kaze looking stressed. The performance profiler on screen showing red bars. Discord chats with Soren.

#### **Act 3: The Return**

**Central Theme:** Facing the consequences of creation—both the risks and the rewards—and defining the project's legacy.

**4. The Digital Town Square**

- **Focus:** The unique reality of building a game live on stream.
- **Interview Focus (Kaze):** His philosophy on feedback ("feelings are real, reasoning is stupid"). How does the stream help or hinder his focus?
- **Show, Don't Tell:** Use clips of chat suggesting ideas that get implemented. The "coin-stealing guy" pity mechanic, the "mirror Mario" wall-kick, the "growing flower" vine. Show Kaze's real-time reaction and implementation.
- **B-Roll:** A montage of chat messages, Kaze responding to them, fan art, community Discord discussions.

**6. The Finish Line and the Future**

- **Focus:** The immense pressure and relief of completion.
- **Interview Focus (All Team Members):**
  - What does it feel like to be "80% done" for years?
  * The importance of the Overworld as the "final stretch" and "most important part."
  - What are their hopes for the game's release and reception?
- **The Kickstart:** Explicitly connect the release of RTYI to Kaze's plan to launch a Kickstarter for his own original game. Frame RTYI not as an endpoint, but as a massive, multi-year "advertisement" and proof of concept.
- **B-Roll:** The team celebrating a milestone in a Discord call. Kaze looking at early plans for his _new_ game.
