# {{ modelLabel }} – Stream Analysis

This page presents a systematic analysis of [Kaze's development streams](https://www.youtube.com/@KazeClips/streams) processed by the **{{ modelLabel }}** model after they were transcribed with Whisper.

Each stream provides insights into the development process, collaboration, and game design decisions made by Kaze.
