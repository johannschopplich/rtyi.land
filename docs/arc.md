**9. The Living Project (The Community)**

- **Narrative Goal:** Show how the open development process made the game a living entity.
- **Key Content:**
  - The demo strategy: Why release a demo of Course 1? Use Kaze's quotes about gathering data on physics and camera to "make the game more fun."
  - Kaze's philosophy on feedback: "feelings are real, reasoning is stupid." Show examples of him incorporating or rejecting chat ideas.
  - The "Save State Yoshi": A perfect, humorous example of a direct developer-to-player interaction built into the game itself.
