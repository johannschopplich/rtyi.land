## Game Development Process
- Actively developing new gameplay mechanics, such as a rideable "soap bar" (referred to as "soul bar" initially) that shrinks over time and can be used to clean "oil slicks."
- Working on UI elements, specifically a new star select screen featuring small 3D panoramas for each level to convey its "vibe."
- Iterative development on visual effects, including custom particle systems for soap bubbles (texture, color, fade, quantity) and exploring shaders/texture manipulation for oil slick appearance.
- The project is based on the Mario 64 decompilation.
- Mentions fixing bugs in a previous project (OnlyUp64), indicating a commitment to polish that likely extends to "Return to Yoshi's Island" (RTYI).
- Progress is made on features within single streams (e.g., "programmed the whole soap bar just today").
- Discussions around ROM space optimization and performance considerations for N64 hardware/emulators are ongoing.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze values originality and is confident in his creative process ("See, I have never seen Anon's idea, so that doesn't matter, because that means I didn't steal it.").
- He places high importance on visual appeal and "flare" in game development ("Adding visual flare is important to the game... Your game would just look like a shadow of a game and not a real game.").
- Expresses a pragmatic approach to development, often creating custom solutions (e.g., particle engine) to meet specific needs.
- Openly shares opinions on tools (dislike for Parallel Launcher's frequent updates, preference for Project64, excitement for a potential new tool), game design, and even off-topic subjects.
- Shows a preference for moving forward with new development rather than extensively revisiting old projects ("I don't like going back and updating shit"), though he does fix bugs.
- Has a clear vision for how elements should "feel" and "look," iterating until satisfied.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak (also referred to as "Biomech"):**
    - A significant contributor to visual design.
    - Provided "pretty cool ideas" and a mockup for the new star select screen that Kaze prefers.
    - Requested specific visual features for particles, such as bubbles fading to white ("This is what Biomech has asked for.").
    - Kaze discusses Biobak's ideas for oil puddle fading.
- **Zeina:**
    - Mentioned as being "at work" during the stream ("Zeyna is actually at work right now").
    - Her specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" are not detailed in this transcript, but her mention implies involvement or association with Kaze's development circle.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Anonymous Moose:** Mentioned as having come up with an idea (related to the Wiggler or another mechanic) that Kaze also independently conceived.
    - **Unnamed tool developer:** Kaze mentions a "guy that made a really, really useful tool 20 years ago" who is now making a new one, which Kaze is excited about. This suggests potential use of new community tools.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Star Select Screen:** Debating between using images (texture-based panoramas) versus pre-rendered 3D scenes. The decision leans towards 3D scenes due to ROM space efficiency (0.3-0.5 MB per course for textures is too much) and better upscaling on emulators.
- **"Soap Bar" Mechanic:**
    - Designed as a rideable object that shrinks and disappears over time, preventing indefinite use.
    - Technical challenges included inverted normals, refining collision, Mario's animation when falling off, and controlling how it shrinks (from the bottom, requiring Mario's offset).
    - Visuals (sparkles, size) were iterated upon.
- **Particle Effects (Soap Bubbles):**
    - Decision to create custom bubble particles for better control over rendering and appearance (color, fade to white, transparency, quantity).
    - Addressed issues with finding suitable bubble textures and integrating them.
    - Kaze's custom particle engine avoids reloading textures for each particle, optimizing performance.
- **Oil Slick Mechanic:**
    - Designing a system where the soap bar cleans up oil slicks.
    - Challenge: How to make the cleanup visually effective and appealing (e.g., dynamically updating an alpha mask, making pixels black).
    - Explored adding a "shine" or rainbow effect using vertex color hue shifting based on camera angle, referencing Mario Kart oil slicks but ultimately questioning its realism for oil.
- **ROM Space & Performance:** Recurring considerations, influencing choices about textures, 3D models, and effects. Kaze removed original mk64 backgrounds to save ~0.3MB.
- **Bug Fixing:** Encountered and worked on various bugs, including inverted normals, object behavior issues (`numkeys` variable, `actWritingShell`), and crashes.
- **Water Level Manipulation:** Considered for the overworld (an island you rescue) to show water returning over time. An existing, different type of water level manipulation is in "All Alone Bubble Dome." Porting the "World Dry World" version is a long-term idea.

## Business Aspects
- **Funding:** A "new donation link in the description of the stream" is mentioned, indicating community donations as a source of support.
- **Release Plans:** Implied intention to release the game, with comments like, "That's definitely something we have to fix before release."
- **Marketing/Promotion:** Kaze hosts F3 (a ROM hacking event), which serves as a platform for community engagement and showcasing work. Streaming development is also a form of direct marketing.

## Key Quotes
- "So, we're gonna have a soul bar here, and you can stand on the soul bar and ride it kinda like a Koopa, like a Koopa shell." (Introducing a core new mechanic)
- "So if we have a pre-rendered 3D scene, it's going to be cheaper ROM-wise. And it's going to look better on emulator." (Rationale for a key design choice balancing technical constraints and visual goals for the Star Select)
- "Adding visual flare is important to the game. You can't just not add visual flare to the game. Your game would just look like a shadow of a game and not a real game." (Kaze's philosophy on the importance of aesthetics)
- "I think we're done with the soap honestly we programmed the whole soap bar just today that's that's not that bad with a pretty sick effect next we need to make an oil sploosh here that you can clean up with the bubble" (Marking progress and transitioning to the next related feature)

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Genesis and Vision of "Return to Yoshi's Island":** Explore the initial inspiration, the connection to the Yoshi's Island IP, and the overarching goals for the game, particularly regarding the "island rescue" theme and dynamic water levels.
- **Collaborative Synergy with Biobak:** Delve into the working relationship with Biobak. How are visual ideas conceptualized and iterated upon? Discuss specific examples like the star select screen or particle effects.
- **Innovating within Limitations:** Discuss the challenges and triumphs of developing advanced mechanics (like the soap bar/oil slick system) and visual effects (custom particles, dynamic textures) within the N64's constraints and using the SM64 decompilation.
- **Gameplay Philosophy and "Game Feel":** Explore Kaze's approach to designing unique gameplay elements. What makes a mechanic like the "soap bar" compelling, and how much does the "vibe" or "feel" drive design choices over pure functionality?
- **The Role of Community and Future of SM64 Modding:** Discuss how direct community interaction during streams and events like F3 shapes the development of RTYI and Kaze's perspective on the evolution and future landscape of SM64 ROM hacking.
