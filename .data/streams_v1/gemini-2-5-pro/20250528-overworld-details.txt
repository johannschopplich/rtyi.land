## Game Development Process
- The game is in a significant stage of development, with a "beta test of course six" having recently been completed successfully.
- Kaze is actively working on the overworld, specifically designing and filling out "Part 6 and 7," with the stated goal that the island will be "halfway done" soon.
- The development process is iterative and fluid; Kaze is simultaneously fixing old levels, managing production notes, brainstorming new level ideas ("Wingcap based level"), and finalizing core assets like Mario's model.
- There's a clear workflow of blocking out large areas, identifying design problems (e.g., empty spaces), brainstorming solutions with the community, and then implementing them.
- A significant milestone mentioned is the upcoming finalization of Mario's model, which will end the process of "reworking Mario forever."

## Personal Insights
- Kaze is contemplating his future after RTYI, weighing whether to continue making ROM hacks or transition to creating his own original games, a decision he states "depends on the success of RTYI."
- He expresses a complex relationship with Nintendo. He believes they are aware of the project and choose not to issue a DMCA for the hack itself, but he feels their targeting of his YouTube videos is "extremely petty."
- He holds strong opinions on game design, valuing feedback from other designers like Shigeru Miyamoto not just for his legacy, but for his expertise.
- He sees ROM hacking and game development as a potential career path, fantasizing about a future where a successful RTYI leads to a "game studio is going to make romhacks and real games."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** No relevant information found in this transcript.
- **Biobak:** Mentioned as "Biobak" (likely a typo). Kaze notes that RTYI will be a net financial negative after he pays Biobak, indicating they are a key paid contributor, likely for art/graphics.
- **Zeina:** Mentioned as "Zeyna" or "Zaina". Her phone alarm goes off during the stream, suggesting she is present or in communication with Kaze during development sessions. Her role seems to be in animation, though not explicitly detailed in this segment.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Saren:** The composer for the "retro section" OST. Their work is described as "banger ideas" and features "fully dynamic music, like Breath of the Wild has it."
    - **Lila:** A significant contributor working on technical aspects. She is mentioned in relation to fixing the lighthouse texture, working on "Fallout 64," and providing feedback. Kaze has a direct, collaborative dialogue with her in the stream chat.
    - **Shep:** Mentioned alongside Lila, but their specific role is not detailed.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Design:** A major challenge discussed is a long, empty stretch of land in the overworld. Kaze brainstorms multiple solutions before deciding on adding a secret level unlocked by sponsoring an "athlete Yoshi" who is training for a long jump. This fills the space and creates a unique coin-sink mechanic.
- **Scope Creep Management:** Kaze actively manages the project's scope. While he adds new "mini levels" based on single mechanics (like a Wingcap level), he justifies it by stating they are very quick to produce ("half a day levels") and add significant value. He ultimately decides to solve the "empty stretch" problem by adding a planned secret level rather than deleting the area.
- **Technical Challenges:** The stream addresses a bug with a texture ("ENV color leeching from somewhere") and emulator compatibility issues, specifically with "parallel launcher," which required a coordinated fix that was not deployed in time for the demo.
- **Coin Economy:** There's a recurring discussion about the purpose of coins. Kaze wants to avoid simple "coin dumps" like a wishing well that could encourage grinding. Instead, he favors unique, interactive coin-gated content, like sponsoring the athlete Yoshi, to make spending coins feel meaningful and tied to world progression.

## Business Aspects
- **Monetization and Viability:** Kaze questions if RTYI will be a "net positive money wise," factoring in his YouTube and Patreon income against payments to collaborators like Biobak.
- **Future Business Model:** He has an innovative idea for a game studio that would develop original commercial games and fan games (ROM hacks) simultaneously, using each to market the other.
- **Event Planning:** He is planning to host "F3" (a fan-game-focused event) around the end of July and is considering seeking a sponsor for it for the first time.
- **Relationship with Nintendo:** He navigates a legal "gray area" by releasing his work as patches. He believes Nintendo avoids taking down the patches themselves to not risk a legal precedent, so they target his YouTube videos instead, which directly impacts his income and visibility.

## Key Quotes
- "if I make 20 million dollars off of RTYI I'm opening a game studio and the game studio is going to make romhacks and real games dude how banger would it be if you develop real games that were also fan games at the same time and you released both at once to like market each other"
- "they don't even take down the mods. the mods are always released as patches and patches are kind of a legal gray area and they know that and they don't want to risk changing that gray area I think so that's why they only come after videos which to me feels extremely petty"
- "The idea is you sponsor him, which means he has better equipment or whatever and then you come back after you did like three stars elsewhere in the game and he like jumps better... As long as you see the island progressing from it."

## Potential Interview Topics
- **The Creator's Dilemma:** Explore the tension between creating free fan projects (ROM hacks) and the desire to build a sustainable career making original games. How does RTYI fit into Kaze's long-term personal and professional goals?
- **The "Guerilla" Game Studio:** Delve into the unique business model of a studio that produces both fan games and commercial titles. What are the marketing, legal, and creative implications of this symbiotic relationship?
- **Collaborative Direction:** Discuss the process of directing a team of distributed, passionate collaborators (Saren, Lila, etc.). How does Kaze balance his singular vision with the creative input and technical work of his team?
- **Designing in the Gray:** A deeper conversation about the legal and emotional reality of creating high-profile work within a legal gray area. How does the constant threat of takedowns from a company like Nintendo influence the creative process and the project's release strategy?
- **Live Development and Community:** Explore the role of the live stream and community interaction in shaping the game. How has this public, iterative design process affected the final product compared to a more traditional, private development cycle?
