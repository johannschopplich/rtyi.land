## Game Development Process
-   Currently focused on developing the "Block Boss" fight for "Return to Yoshi's Island."
-   Significant progress on the boss fight mechanics was made off-stream, including performance improvements.
-   The stream covered work on the boss's fleeing animation, damage effects (color flashing, shaking, animation speed), and integrating a new song by Baduk.
-   Key tasks for the Block Boss include implementing its ability to disappear and reappear, defining player damage for failing certain mechanics, adding particles, and ensuring players take damage from an oil hazard.
-   The boss arena is undergoing a visual re-theme, moving from an oil barrel concept to a warehouse/cave hybrid.
-   ROM size is a critical concern, with music taking up a significant portion (approx. 35.6MB of a 64MB target). This necessitates exploring music compression or alternative audio formats.
-   The project is stated to have 11 out of 15 courses completed.
-   Kaze plans to finish the current Block Boss fight development off-stream.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze prefers to work on more complex development tasks off-stream to maintain focus.
-   He expresses strong opinions on various topics, including philosophy (criticism of Emanuel Kant), social norms ("swears being a bad thing is such an American concept"), and game design principles (dislike of button prompts, games becoming "chores").
-   He values performance and engine-level understanding, discussing topics like C++ vs C, object struct memory management, and optimal coordinate systems (Z-Up for cache coherency).
-   Kaze acknowledges the difficulty of making good games: "It's more so than just it's hard to make a good game, and most people just don't."
-   He balances his passion project with external responsibilities: "I have a full-time job. I can't work on this unlimitedly."

## Collaborator Information
-   **Baduk (Composer):**
    -   Contributed a "really good" new song for the Boombox Koopas.
    -   Kaze mentions Baduk's music contributions in the context of overall sound design.
-   **Biobak (Graphics Artist - referred to as Biomech/Biobak in transcript):**
    -   Provided the 3D model for the Block Boss, which Kaze modified for damage visuals.
    -   Engaged in discussions about model issues (e.g., pivot points) and visual effects like N64 combiners.
    -   Kaze consulted Biomech for ideas on the boss arena's visual theming (e.g., cages).
-   **Zeina (Animations):**
    -   No direct mention of "Zeina" or specific animation contributions attributed to her by that name in this transcript. "Lila" (see Other Contributors) is a key technical collaborator whose work on Fast64 (the modeling/animation tool) may support the animation pipeline. Kaze discusses animation techniques like switch bones vs. animation bones, and issues with Fast64 affecting animation data.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **Lila (Key Technical Collaborator):**
        -   Frequently addressed by Kaze regarding technical issues and bug fixes for "Fast64" (the SM64 modding toolset).
        -   Engaged in discussions about texture choices (e.g., tree stump texture) and low-level engine details (e.g., GeoASM node children).
        -   Her role appears crucial for maintaining/improving the development toolchain.
    -   **"the dupe" (Idea Contributor):**
        -   Suggested a music compression technique (streaming a repeating background beat separately).

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Block Boss Mechanics:**
    -   Designed to flee when Mario is on a "soap" platform, with speed increasing as it takes damage.
    -   Visual feedback for damage includes color flashing (orange), shaking, and faster animations.
    -   The fight involves multiple phases, requiring the player to use soap to attack, dodge waves, and manage platforming elements.
    -   A key challenge is clearly communicating attack mechanics to the player (Kaze believes the soap's purpose is obvious).
    -   The boss will have action states like disappearing and reappearing, and a punishment phase for player failure.
-   **Boss Arena Design:**
    -   The arena theme is being iteratively designed, moving from an "oil barrel" to a "junkyard," "oil tankers," "warehouse," and finally a "cave/warehouse mix" with a tilted square layout.
    -   The arena will feature dynamic elements like "grills" that move up and down.
    -   A challenge lies in integrating the soap spawning mechanism thematically (e.g., strike workers in jail cells, a janitor Koopa throwing soap).
-   **Technical Obstacles:**
    -   **ROM Size Limit (64MB):** Music is the largest consumer of space, prompting considerations for sequenced music, mono audio, or reducing streamed tracks.
    -   **Fast64 Tool Bugs:** Issues with the modding toolset (e.g., animation data corruption, node hierarchy problems) require workarounds or fixes.
    -   **Memory Management:** Kaze opts to reuse existing object variables (like `all_health`) to conserve RAM, rather than expanding object structures or implementing dynamic memory systems, due to performance concerns on N64.
-   **Balancing Difficulty:** Kaze aims to "not want the gap between like a bad player and a good player to be too big."

## Business Aspects
-   Kaze discusses a recent increase in his personal YouTube revenue, which he speculates might be due to YouTube's changes regarding ad-blockers. This income supports him but is not presented as direct funding for the game project itself.
-   He mentions purchasing a house and moving soon, a personal life event.
-   There is no explicit mention of marketing strategies, dedicated funding for "Return to Yoshi's Island," or specific release/distribution plans, beyond the typical understanding that ROM hacks are community-distributed. The project's release is contingent on Kaze's available time due to his full-time job.

## Key Quotes
-   "I've made a lot of progress on this fight off stream as usual... this might be something that I have to do to offstream because this is a bit too complicated for stream." (Highlights development workflow and complexity management).
-   "The problem is that most of it is music and we can't really compress that because it has to be streamed directly from ROM... two-thirds of the ROM is just music that we cannot compress." (Pinpoints a major technical constraint).
-   "This area is just not turning out as I want it to be." (Illustrates the iterative and sometimes frustrating nature of creative design, specifically for the boss arena).
-   "Video games are not supposed to be chores! That's my rant for the day." (Reflects Kaze's core game design philosophy).

## Potential Interview Topics
-   **The Creative Vision for the Block Boss:** Explore the inspirations and goals behind its unique mechanics (soap riding, fleeing behavior, multi-phase design) and the iterative process of bringing it to life.
-   **Navigating N64/SM64 Decompilation Limitations:** Delve into the specific challenges of working within the N64's constraints (ROM size, processing power, memory) and the SM64 decompilation, particularly regarding music, custom assets, and complex actor behavior.
-   **Collaboration in ROM Hacking:** Discuss the dynamic with collaborators like Baduk, Biomech, and Lila/Zeina. How are tasks divided? How is creative and technical feedback exchanged and integrated, especially in a remote, community-driven project?
-   **Kaze's Game Design Philosophy:** Expand on his views regarding player experience, difficulty balancing (e.g., "skill gap"), the role of tutorials/prompts, and his critiques of common game design tropes (e.g., "chores").
-   **The Future of "Return to Yoshi's Island" and ROM Hacking:** Discuss his long-term vision for the project, anticipated challenges beyond the current boss, and his broader thoughts on the SM64 decompilation's impact on the ROM hacking scene.
