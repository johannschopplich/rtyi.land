## Game Development Process
-   The game "Return to Yoshi's Island" is stated to be "just above 80 percent finished."
-   Three courses (13, 14, 15) are left to complete.
-   Course 12 is mostly finished, pending a few animations from Zeina and some signs.
-   Course 13 is planned to be a "mysterious type ice castle, like very, very suspenseful."
-   Course 14 is planned as a "space arcade," and work has already begun on it, with a secret area completed (related to "the compact" with Eiza).
-   Course 15's theme is currently undecided.
-   The development process for levels includes a "blockout phase" using basic primitives to figure out jumps and layout, followed by 3D modeling and then aesthetics.
-   The current focus for the "Divine Dino Domain" (Course 2 rework) is to make the platforming fun before working on aesthetics.
-   Kaze mentions using Fast64, a Blender extension that exports F3D, for development.
-   There are challenges with loading all areas in one go due to decompilation limitations, unlike older binary methods using RoamManager.

## Personal Insights
-   Kaze expresses a willingness to significantly rework or change existing level designs if he feels they are not fun or "sucked."
-   He prioritizes gameplay and fun factor over adhering to initial plans: "We're just kinda trying to make the platforming fun. And then after we have the platforming, we're gonna work on the aesthetic."
-   He shows a pragmatic approach to problem-solving, including live troubleshooting of bugs during the stream.
-   Kaze has strong opinions on various topics (e.g., barbers, long hair, YouTube comments), which gives insight into his personality.
-   He reflects on his YouTube content strategy, analyzing click-through rates and titles.
-   He mentions being hesitant to show his "fucked up haircut" but eventually does, showing a humorous and somewhat vulnerable side.

## Collaborator Information
-   **Badub:** No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" mentioned in this transcript.
-   **Biobak:** No specific contributions to "Return to Yoshi's Island" mentioned in this transcript.
-   **Zeina (Zayna/Zana):**
    -   Provides animations for the game. Course 12 requires "a few more animations from Zeina" to be considered complete.
    -   Also involved in personal interactions, such as the haircut incident.
-   **Other Contributors:**
    -   **AkiDev:** Contributed Chain Chomp code, which Kaze later modified significantly to support a second Chain Chomp in a different level.
    -   **Eiza:** Kaze mentions an area in Course 14 he can't show because "Eiza doesn't want me to show it. Because it's part of the compact." This implies Eiza has a role in deciding what content is revealed, possibly another developer or collaborator on a specific feature/project.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
-   **Reworking Divine Dino Domain (Course 2):** The original auto-scrolling section with "leaf bolts" was deemed to "suck" and has been replaced with a "platforming playground." The focus is on improving player experience in a sub-area that "sucks to play."
-   **Level Themes:** Specific themes are decided for upcoming courses (Ice Castle, Space Arcade), though Course 15 is still open.
-   **Platforming Focus:** Emphasis on creating fun platforming sections before detailed visual work. This is evident in the blockout phase for Divine Dino Domain.
-   **Technical Bugs:**
    -   A significant bug where being in water can crash the game because "Water hasn't been updated to the new step function yet."
    -   Long loading times experienced during the stream, possibly related to other issues.
    -   The game crashes multiple times during the stream, particularly when working on Divine Dino Domain or using the Parallel emulator.
-   **Collision/Hitbox Issues:** Kaze notes a "scatter box" might be too big and needs reduction. He also adjusts object placement to avoid clipping.
-   **Aesthetics vs. Gameplay:** A recurring decision is to finalize gameplay mechanics and platforming flow first, then address the visual aspects and UV mapping.
-   **Emulator Issues:** Kaze expresses frustration with the Parallel emulator due to frequent updates, slower speed, ROM hack-specific issues, and controller incompatibility, preferring other emulators for testing.

## Business Aspects
-   **YouTube as Marketing/Engagement:** Kaze actively monitors YouTube analytics (click-through rates) for his videos and experiments with titles to improve performance ("See, YouTube is all about the angle."). He acknowledges funneling viewers from videos to streams as a "marketing ploy."
-   **Stream Monetization:** He jokingly suggests monetizing his "misfortune" (bad haircut) through subscription incentives ("Every sap, I'll move it slightly.").
-   **Release Strategy (General):** While no specific release date for RTYI is given beyond "when it's done," he mentions another mod's release being tied to SimpleFlips' competition.
-   **Legal Considerations:** Kaze states he doesn't offer Patreon bonuses "Because that might get me in legal trouble with Nintendo."
-   **F3 (Fan Game Festival):** Kaze expresses uncertainty about hosting F3 in the current year due to personal reasons (expecting a child).

## Key Quotes
-   "How much percent finished just above 80. We're getting there." (Provides a clear progress update.)
-   "But I realized the section sucked. So now we have a little bit of a platforming playground here." (Illustrates his iterative design philosophy and focus on fun.)
-   "We're just kinda trying to make the platforming fun. And then after we have the platforming, we're gonna work on the aesthetic." (Highlights his development priority.)
-   "Water hasn't been updated to the new step function yet and the old step functions are not fully supported anymore, so being in water can just crash the game." (Details a significant technical challenge.)
-   "See, YouTube is all about the angle. [...] What Nintendo's biggest lie is doesn't matter. What matters is that we have a YouTube title. This is how YouTubers think, by the way." (Offers insight into his YouTube strategy and content creation mindset.)
