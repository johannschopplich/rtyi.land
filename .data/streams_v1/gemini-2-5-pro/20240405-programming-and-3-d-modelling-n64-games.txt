## Game Development Process
- Kaze is actively working on a specific level, implementing elements like bandits, NPC interactions, and environment details (e.g., Tumbleweed store, Koopa bank).
- Significant progress has been made on interactive elements like trains, which now have VFX, SFX, and camera shake.
- A major ongoing challenge is N64 RAM limitations, which has led to decisions like cutting a planned area ("Yoshi Ranch") and using clever design to avoid excessive 3D modeling (e.g., bandits stealing items from stores).
- Debugging and fixing behaviors, particularly vanilla Mario 64 elements like the Pokey enemy, is a time-consuming part of the process due to interactions with Kaze's custom engine modifications.
- The to-do list includes finishing signs, placing NPCs, and implementing enemy behaviors. The current level is described as "40,000 triangles," indicating its complexity.
- Kaze is also focusing on polishing aspects like lighting and collision.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze aims for a game that evokes the Mario 64 feel but isn't a direct imitation: "we don't want the exact Mario 64 look. It still looks very Mario 64."
- He has a clear vision for the soundtrack, desiring something that uses the Mario 64 sound font creatively to sound new yet familiar: "it sounds like a completely new soundtrack with like a similar vibe to me. That's what I want anyway."
- He expresses strong opinions on game design, such as disliking "music themes" for levels as they've "already been done," and has a general aversion to 2D platformers and most boss fights.
- Kaze is pragmatic when facing technical limitations, accepting the necessity of cutting content like the "Yoshi Ranch" for the overall health of the project.
- He reflects on the nature of his custom engine modifications, acknowledging that it can sometimes break vanilla game behaviors, requiring significant debugging.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Badem Soundcloud):**
    - Composer for the game.
    - Kaze praises his music as "freaking amazing" and notes its creative use of the default Mario 64 sound font to achieve a new yet fitting vibe.
- **Biobak (referred to as Biobak/Biobak):**
    - Appears to be a graphics artist, possibly working on lighting systems.
    - Kaze mentions a "node-based lightning" system that Biobak might be implementing, and humorously questions a texture/lighting issue possibly related to Biobak's work.
- **Zeina (Zeno):**
    - Animator and asset creator.
    - Kaze mentions needing to ask Zeina to create animations for characters (e.g., Pokey) and 3D models for level elements (e.g., "tumbleweed store").
- **Other Contributors:**
    - While not direct asset contributors in the same vein, chat members like **Leila** and **Minty** provide real-time feedback, ask clarifying questions, and act as a sounding board for Kaze during the development stream. Leila, in particular, seems to have ongoing conversations with Kaze about visual elements.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **RAM Limitation:** This is the most significant recurring challenge. It dictates:
    - Scope of levels (e.g., cutting the "Yoshi Ranch" area).
    - Asset creation strategies (e.g., having bandits "steal" items from stores to avoid modeling the items themselves: "this is a trick we do so we don't actually have to 3D model the stuff here because we are getting pretty close to running out of RAM").
    - The need to meticulously manage triangle counts and data per area. Kaze expresses a wish for "data per area" to be easier in the decompilation project.
- **Enemy Behavior Implementation:**
    - Integrating and debugging vanilla Mario 64 enemy behaviors (like Pokey) into Kaze's modified engine is a major task. The Pokey required extensive debugging to fix its spawning, movement, scaling, collision, and visual rendering.
    - Kaze discovered the Pokey's original code performed an unexpectedly high number of raycasts (37 per tick), which conflicted with his engine's optimization that stops raycasting for non-moving objects.
- **NPC and Level Interactivity:**
    - Designing NPCs with specific dialogue and roles to make the world feel more alive (e.g., characters complaining about sold-out items, a shifty character, interactions at the train station).
    - Implementing interactive elements like trains that act as obstacles with VFX and SFX.
- **Lighting and Visuals:**
    - Fixing issues where objects or parts of models don't receive lighting correctly (e.g., Yoshi coins, parts of character models).
    - Adjusting textures and shaders to achieve the desired look while working within engine constraints.
- **Level Design & Pacing:**
    - Adding coins to guide players and encourage exploration (e.g., "coins on the track here to encourage the player to explore this").
    - Realizing late in the process that elements like "train tracks" will consume more memory, leading to further concerns.

## Business Aspects
- **Donations/Funding:**
    - Kaze experiences significant issues with his PayPal account and donation setup, indicating that donations are a form of support for his work. He mentions his old PayPal email being linked and needing to resolve issues with identity verification.
- **Marketing/Visibility (Informal):**
    - Kaze briefly muses about "theory baiting" popular YouTubers (Swanky Box, Nathaniel Bandy, etc.) by including intriguing elements in the game, suggesting an awareness of how community content creators can generate visibility.
- No formal release plans, distribution methods, or other direct business strategies were discussed in this transcript segment.

## Key Quotes
- "And this is a trick we do so we don't actually have to 3D model the stuff here because we are getting pretty close to running out of RAM." (Illustrates creative problem-solving due to technical constraints).
- "It still looks very Mario 64. I don't think the ones in Mario 64 go for the metallic look actually... We don't want the exact Mario 64 look." (Highlights the balance between nostalgia and new artistic direction).
- "Remember when I said that I wouldn't be surprised? If the pokey just worked This is what we got this is pokey peak performance... Actually, no. A Pokey was doing 36 Raycasts every tick... And my engine made it so that if an object doesn't move it doesn't Raycast the floor every tick. But they needed the floor to be Raycasted every tick." (Summarizes the challenges of integrating vanilla features into a modified engine and the deep technical debugging required).
