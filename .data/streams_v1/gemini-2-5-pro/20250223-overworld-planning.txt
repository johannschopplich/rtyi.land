## Game Development Process
- The Overworld design is a primary focus and considered the "last major thing" before shifting to smaller tasks.
- The development process for the Overworld involves 2D sketching (in Photoshop), creating 3D sketches, and plans for beta testing these sketches to gather player feedback for iterative adjustments.
- Specific levels are being completed, with "Course 15 is finished, yeah" mentioned as a milestone. This course is retro-themed, incorporating elements from Mario 64.
- The game is planned to be substantial, with Kaze envisioning the Overworld to be "around four times the size of Super Mario 64 Biobak."
- Side levels are planned and spaces are being considered for them within the Overworld structure.

## Personal Insights
- Kaze has a strong design philosophy: "For the overworld it's very important to me that if you can see it as a player then you can go there so I want the player to experience like every single inch of yoshi's island in the end."
- He values unique and creative solutions, often referring to good ideas as "banger ideas."
- Kaze admits to a personal challenge with collaboration: "I also have this weird thing where I do not want to reach out to people and ask for help Because a lot of the time I feel like I'm gonna say all this actually isn't up to the quality standards I expect... That always feels like super bad for everyone involved."
- He is working on the stream despite being "really sick," indicating dedication but also a potential impact on his work.
- He expresses a desire for level entrances to be unique and memorable: "One thing I definitely want in this is unique ways to discover level entrances."

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub (Madu):**
    - Kaze is considering asking Madu to "make a remix of all the more 64 songs."
    - Kaze states, "I think but who [Madu] wants to make the whole OST But I'm not a hundred percent."
    - Role: Composer, potentially for the entire Original Soundtrack (OST), with a focus on remixes.
- **Biobak (Biobak):**
    - Kaze actively seeks Biobak's opinion on design ideas during the stream (e.g., "Biobak, what do you think about the idea of, like, make this a true river...").
    - Engages in discussions about game design conventions with him.
    - Role: Acts as a sounding board for design ideas and provides feedback.
- **Zeina (Zayn/Zayna):**
    - "Yeah, Zayn already has a lot of sketches about how Mario goes through the levels."
    - "Zeina's drawing them right now to kind of look like a rainbow board from Mario Kart" for Course 15.
    - Involved in creating visual assets and level edits.
    - Role: Artist/Animator, providing sketches, art assets, and contributing to level visuals.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Esa:** "The side level Esa's making is also very gimmicky... It's very slidey."
    - Role: Level designer, creating a side level with specific mechanics.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Overworld Structure:** The Overworld is envisioned as the entirety of Yoshi's Island, divided into multiple (around 14) interconnected "small areas" to allow for varied vibes. There's a desire for a 360-degree view of the island from certain points.
- **Level Unlocking & Progression:** A significant challenge is how to gate progression and level entrances. Kaze wants to avoid "cheap" mechanics like simple star doors if possible, preferring puzzles or thematic unlocks. He brainstorms ideas like:
    - Kamek creating magic barriers requiring stars.
    - Mice needing "power of five stars" to clear an obstacle.
    - A boat sliding further towards a river (Course 2 entrance) with each star.
    - Using a lighthouse beam to reveal the Ghost Ship.
    - Potentially having Wario guard the Zoo entrance, requiring stars or a puzzle.
- **Unique Level Entrances:** A core design goal is to have unique and memorable ways to access levels (e.g., the lighthouse idea for the Ghost Ship, a burrow entrance for Bunny Brushwoods, a boat that slides towards a river).
- **Player Guidance & Pacing:** Kaze considers how players will navigate and unlock the world, including "quick warp" pipes to connect distant Overworld parts after initial exploration, describing some sections as "edging" the player's curiosity.
- **Inspiration and Originality:** Kaze draws inspiration from "Yoshi's Island" (SNES), "Super Mario 64," and other Mario titles (Mario Party, Paper Mario) but aims to create original mechanics and layouts, e.g., debating whether the island should be shaped like a Yoshi.
- **Specific Area Concepts:** Detailed brainstorming for various Overworld areas like beaches, cliffs, jungles, Bowser Mines (initially inaccessible), a ghost ship, a zoo, an ice cap level, broken castles, a super happy tree, a waterfall area, a volcano area, and underwater caves.

## Business Aspects
- **Release Timing:** "I don't know about 2025 release." Indicates a tentative and uncertain release window.
- **Marketing (Implicit):** The initial tutorial section is described as "just marketing to a ship," suggesting it's designed to hook the player and showcase the game's appeal.
- No other explicit mentions of funding, formal distribution plans, or other business aspects were found, which is typical for a ROM hack project.

## Key Quotes
- "The idea for the Overworld is that the Overworld is the entirety of Yoshi's Island." (Core concept for the game's hub world)
- "What if the ship is here, but it's like a shadowy fix, and you have to go into the lighthouse that is down here. And in the lighthouse, you point the light at the ship. And that makes the ship visible and breaks through the fog. And now you can actually enter it. I think that's a banger idea." (Example of creative problem-solving for a level entrance)
- "For the overworld it's very important to me that if you can see it as a player then you can go there so I want the player to experience like every single inch of yoshi's island in the end." (Kaze's core design philosophy for exploration)
