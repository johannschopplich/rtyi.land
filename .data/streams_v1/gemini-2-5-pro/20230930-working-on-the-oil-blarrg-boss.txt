## Game Development Process
- **Overall Progress:** The game is stated to be "over 70% done" with "like four and a half courses" remaining to be completed.
- **Engine Enhancements:** Kaze has made significant improvements to his custom engine based on the Mario 64 decompilation. This includes reducing render time (e.g., a 5% improvement, saving 600 microseconds), making it easier to add shadows and culling radiuses to objects, and optimizing RAM usage.
- **Current Focus Areas (during the stream):**
    - Implementing a new, visually enhanced Star Select screen, including integrating assets from Biobak, programming animations, and resolving layout/centering issues.
    - Developing the "oil block" functionality and visuals.
    - Creating a robust player respawn system for when Mario falls into hazards, involving logic to find safe respawn points on level geometry.
- **Optimization:** A continuous effort, particularly in culling (fixing original SM64 culling logic to be more effective) and ensuring features run efficiently on N64 hardware (e.g., aiming for 60 FPS on the Star Select screen).
- **Iterative Development:** The stream shows a clear iterative process of coding, testing, debugging, and refining features (e.g., Star Select alignment, respawn behavior, camera adjustments).

## Personal Insights
- **Excitement about Technical Achievements:** Kaze expresses significant enthusiasm for performance gains: "this week was insane I found so many improvements literally I reduced render time by like 5% almost... 5% is so much I went from like 44 FPS to 46."
- **Frustration with External Factors:** He mentions frustration with YouTube channel logistics affecting video views: "I'm really sad that I fucked up today and I accidentally scheduled two videos on the shorts channel for today... and that's why it's getting less views than it should but yeah devastating."
- **Pragmatism and Tool Usage:** Kaze is open to using modern tools like ChatGPT for assistance with complex coding tasks: "Dude, it fucking works. That is so insane. You guys have no idea how hard that would have been to program by myself. And this is why I like chatgpd."
- **Strong Opinions on Development Practices:** He has firm views on certain development approaches, notably his preference for C++ over visual scripting tools like Blueprints for core programming: "fuck him honestly fuck him they have problem you know what pigs they like to roll around on dirt I'm not gonna stop them let them have fun let them roll around on dirt."
- **Sense of Humor and Candor:** Kaze often uses humor and speaks candidly about development struggles and successes.

## Collaborator Information
- **Badub:** Implied to be the composer. Kaze asks chat for "OST wishes for today," suggesting music selection is part of the stream or ongoing work. He also critiques a currently playing song ("this music fucking sucks dude").
- **Biobak (Graphics Artist):** A key collaborator providing visual assets.
    - Supplied new 3D models and designs for the Star Select screen (e.g., "bunny title.blend").
    - Kaze frequently refers to Biobak's intentions for the visuals and seeks clarification/feedback from him (or chat on his behalf) during the stream ("Is this screen the way we want the Biobak?", "I think Biobak just wants it cut out, right?").
    - Communication seems to happen via Discord or similar platforms, with Kaze implementing Biobak's assets and vision.
- **Zeina (Animations):** Mentioned in a personal anecdote ("when Zeina was over here I took her to see the seals"), but no specific contributions to the current development tasks in this stream are detailed.
- **Other Contributors:**
    - **Atlas:** Mentioned as the creator of star select screen assets, possibly using an array modifier in Blender ("Well atlas who's atlas it's an array modifier oh i see that works").
    - **Chat Members (e.g., Leela, Windows Empty, Platonically):** Actively provide feedback, suggestions, and engage in discussions, influencing Kaze's immediate troubleshooting and design thoughts.

## Game Design Decisions/Challenges
- **Star Select Screen Redesign:**
    - **Goal:** Replace the "boring as shit" old star select with a more visually appealing and dynamic one, aiming for 60 FPS.
    - **Challenges:** Importing and scaling Blender models, aligning text and graphical elements, programming scrolling animations, ensuring correct rendering order, and fixing visual glitches (e.g., seams in scrolling background, pop-in).
    - **Solutions:** Decided to use one render function per selectable item for maximum flexibility instead of one geo layout. Extensive trial-and-error for positioning and animation.
- **Player Respawn System (Falling into Hazards):**
    - **Goal:** Create a fair and non-exploitable respawn mechanic where Mario fades out and reappears at a safe, recent location.
    - **Challenges:** Determining a "safe" respawn spot automatically, avoiding respawning inside geometry or on dangerous edges, handling camera transitions smoothly, and choosing appropriate death/respawn animations.
    - **Solutions:** Explored ideas like using the last non-object triangle Mario stood on. Used ChatGPT to generate code for calculating distance to triangle edges to validate respawn points. Iterated on camera behavior and Mario's animation state post-respawn.
- **Culling and Shadows:**
    - **Challenge:** Original SM64 culling was inefficient; adding shadows to enemies was difficult with Fast64.
    - **Solution:** Kaze fixed the culling logic for significant performance gains ("now everything that's off screen is actually getting culled"). His new engine simplifies adding shadows.
- **Camera Control Philosophy:**
    - **Decision:** Avoid explicit 8-direction camera snapping unless levels are designed for it (which they aren't in this game). Keep controls simple ("one button one output philosophy") to avoid making the game feel like a "tool."
- **Oil Block Visuals and Mechanics:** Mentioned as a task for the day, with initial thoughts on modeling a wave shape for the oil.
- **Decal System for Mario Effects:**
    - **Idea:** To add effects like oil stains, create a "decal Mario object" that renders over the normal Mario, allowing for transparency and fade effects.
    - **Consideration:** This is seen as a cool, performant way to add visual polish, but needs careful implementation if new Mario models are added later.

## Business Aspects
- **Patreon:** Mentioned as a way for supporters to identify themselves ("Let's say I'm a patron... you would have to tell me on patreon"). This implies Patreon is a source of community support/funding.
- **YouTube Channel Management:** Kaze discusses scheduling errors on his YouTube channels and the impact on video views, indicating an awareness of his online presence and audience engagement, which is relevant for marketing and visibility.
- **No explicit release/distribution plans discussed in detail**, other than the game being "in beta" and Kaze having access as a "beta tester" (referring to a tool or component, not necessarily the full game release status to public).

## Key Quotes
- "I made my engine a lot easier to use so now we can easily add shadows and culling radiuses to everything." (Highlights engine improvement and its impact)
- "we're missing like four and a half courses so we're like over 70% done at this point." (Provides a clear status update on game completion)
- "Basically, I fixed the culling so now everything that's off screen is actually getting culled and I put the culling into the object layout itself... and culling is correct and that saved like 600 microseconds... it's like a 3% improvement still that's insane." (Demonstrates technical problem-solving and impact)
- "Dude, it fucking works. That is so insane. You guys have no idea how hard that would have been to program by myself. And this is why I like chatgpd." (Shows candidness about challenges and embrace of modern tools)
